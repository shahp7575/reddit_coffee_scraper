Tonight I was talking to my partner about weird childhood experiences growing up, and now that I rehash this story from my childhood, it gives me chills down my spine. 

For starters, I grew up in Northern Michigan. About an hour south of the bridge, right on the banks of Lake Huron. My aunt, lived about  half an hour north on an inland lake with her husband and four kids (I spent a lot of time out there with her as I was an only child, and my cousins were all around my age.) 

I have two specific memories from her house that haunt me to this day. 

The first one is probably when I was five years old, and when I say I remember this so clearly vividly; I’m not lying. (It was so traumatizing, it’s burnt into my memory unfortunately)

My aunt lived right on a large inland lake. To the left of her she had a handful of neighbors but to the right of her house it was all swamp for about a quarter of a mile besides about a hundred feet of yard that was all hers. As kids, my two older cousins and I would poorly swing golfballs into the swamp, and then when we ran out of balls, we would go look for them in the swamp. 

This specific day, our large family was throwing a barbecue. My grandpa was watching us three grandchildren hit the balls into the swamp, as the rest of our family was hanging out on the porch on the opposite side of the house. 

I remember hitting my ball almost completely to the left, so not straight out in front where the rest of the golfballs were typically being poorly hit. My little, five year old self ran through the ditch to the swamp to go retrieve my poorly swung ball. 

Once I reached the swamp, I looked around and could not find where the ball had gone. I remember turning right, and seeing this strange, faceless figure standing about ten feet away from me. 

To describe this figure is that it was human shaped, and had absolutely no detail at all when it came to facial features, genitals, fingers, toes; anything like that. It was completely blurred, almost as if it was nudity being blurred out on a television screen. The strangest part…. it was doing a T-Pose, but shifting its torso back and forth so its arms were swinging violently back and forth. 

I immediately screamed and started crying and ran to my grandpa, my other family running over to ask what was wrong and I told them, of course after checking the woods they found nothing. 

A couple years ago I brought it up to my grandpa and he says he remembers me doing that. It was just so strange, because when I try to find possible cryptids or explanations when it came to that… I can’t find anything because the T-pose part is just so strange. Of course there are faceless figures and what not, but does anyone know of anything doing the T-pose in a violent circular motion? 

That wasn’t my only expirience at the lake house though. 

This next memory I remember perfectly, because it was much more recent, well, not too recent. I was twelve (I’m now twenty four). 

Anyways, it was another night I was spending out at my aunts house. My mom used to work the night shift so I used to spend a lot of nights out with my aunts and cousins. However, this particular night 3/4 of my cousins were gone at sleepovers. Leaving me with my three year old cousin at the time, my aunt, and my uncle. 

I remember we were watching Who Framed Roger Rabbit on their television in the living room. I fell asleep on the love sack in the corner of the living room, which was very typical at the time. The living room was facing the swamp side of the house, and 2/3 of the walls were almost just straight windows with no curtains. You didn’t need curtains though, you had no neighbors; just some lake front yard and a swamp. 

I remember waking up to the sound of knocking, I remember looking at the time on the CD player beneath the tv and it being 2:08 in the morning. 

My first thought was their dog Doc was wagging his tail and his tail was hitting the coffee table out in front of me. I remember verbally saying aloud, “Doc, stop it”. 

The knocking continued, and I kept yelling at the dog to calm down. For Doc was extremely energetic and still young at the time. 

When the sound didn’t stop, I sat up in frustration and looked around for the dog. But Doc wasn’t anywhere to be seen, instead I realized the knocking was coming from behind me. So I turned around, and saw a large, faceless figure, probably seven feet tall knocking on the window behind me. 

I always described this figure as what an old scuba diver would wear, as if the outline of his body was a vintage scuba suit. (I don’t know if I’m explaining it well) but what it’s technically called is a “Mark V Dress”. 

I remember instantly running to my aunts room and shaking her and my uncle awake. Telling them that a man is knocking on the window. My uncle goes the lengths to go outside, he himself is a six foot five, 240 pound man himself, and he comes back and says he didn’t see anything. 

The rest of the night I slept next to my aunt because I was so terrified. It’s a story I still tell till today. I don’t have anymore experiences from her house, but  as I grew older I stopped spending so much time out there. 

Back at thanksgiving this year I was talking to my aunt about that time and asked her if she’s ever experienced anything strange out there. She said that when she built her garden, large amount of birds used to get stuck and die in the fence and she used to have to wake up extra early to clear them before any of us kids noticed. She said daily “black birds” got stuck in the chicken wire, she said At least seven a day. Strange thing; she said it only happened for a month and just randomly stopped, she thought someone was playing a nasty prank on her but never got to the bottom of it. 

Another time she said when she was digging in the same garden (which by the way, is very near to the spot of my first story) she found an old, rusted skeleton key buried in cloth, which is strange because the house is relatively newer. But she doesn’t know how old the land is, or the history. 

I don’t know, just thought to share if anyone has any weird similar stories of that, as I know apparently weird stuff happens in northern Michigan all the time. ",1,1733472231.0,cryptids,0,1.0,False

I all my life haven’t had this fear until a couple of years ago I puked in the parking lot of a local coffee shop I go to. Ever since then, I have had this intense fear of vomiting. Even if my stomach hurts or feels weird, I immediately associate it to vomiting. I begin to panic and lose my mind over it. I thankfully don’t have it as bad as others but the thought of puking makes me panic. I don’t flinch or freak out whenever I see others vomit, I do, however, freak out if someone says they have a stomach bug and I fear that I will contract it. Especially with the cooler seasons coming up, I am terrified of it. I am tired of being scared of it. It prevents me from living my life. I need thoughts and opinions.

We both work full time jobs but his is a bit more flexible so usually we arrive home the same time or he gets home before me.
I leave an hour earlier than he does due to commute.

Before we moved in, we discussed that we should split chores and etc equally. 

I cook every night, I do the washing up too.
On the weekends I do the laundry and put it away.
I do most the cleaning except hoovering, that's the only thing he does.
I also make lunch and coffee for us to take in the mornings as well.

I feel like it is definitely not equally split, I have no time in the morning to do anything either.
He been recently facetiming his family in the morning which started to annoy me as I'm running around doing things while he is chatting on the sofa.

He also has a mindset that some tasks is a woman job, and should be done like that.
Like he works in construction so he lifts heavy while I work primarily in an office so I'm sat all day. (his mindset)

Just need general advice on what to do and how I can be more happier?

I think I figured it out","CONTEXT: I met this girl at a summer job. We got close, i developed feelings, and met up for coffee a week later. We've talked a lot ever since. Mainly career related stuff. Just recently met up to see a movie together at a dine-in theater and she shot some pictures of me at a park.

Now, the issue is she's like 99% engaged. Or at least I know she was but who knows, maybe they called it off for the moment and are just dating again? Idk, but she has a guy. Its just weird to me she's never mentioned him to me. For some reason she avoids talking about him? I had to figure it out on my own.

Anyways, I was disappointed to learn at some point in the summer that i was muted in that I was hidden from seeing her instagram stories. It was during the time her guy came to visit so i thought it was related to that. I wasnt even talking to her or liking her stories during this time so I was really confused.

IF YOU WISH TO SKIP, just read below:::

Well, she just unprivated her instagram and i can see her old stories now on her highlights. (yes, on my other account). She's the type to repost everything on her highlights and it seems she hasnt posted much.

But I think i figured out why she muted me. See, i had talked to her about seeing a show together. She seemed interested, she hadnt known about it. That week I was muted, i see now she has highlighted stories of her going to that show. And im sure with her guy. Which im cool with of course, but like why did she hide me from seeing that? Maybe didnt want me to feel hurt? in the end, I just dont see why she doesnt want me to know she has a guy. She literally avoids mentioning having someone lol she freely mentions her sister, friend or family visiting but never him.

In the end, i've really detached a lot of feelings. Learned to accept more that she's not into me and has someone. Glad that we are friends. But still bothers me that we've hung out together and im still muted. ",0,1733471692.0,AskMen,2,0.5,False

This has been my whole life. I've never had a true friend. I've never had nights out. I've never met up for coffee or been to someone else's house, never had a game night, never messaged anyone knowing they would message back.

And I've started being jealous of my bf because he has that. He has friends and goes out with them, he always has people messaging him, he even has a best friend. He works a social job, and everyone wants to talk to him. While I'm ugly and stupid and awkward and alone.

I try to hide how lonely I am, that I'm ok not having friends. Being autistic and disabled and social anxious, that it's fine. But it's not. I just want friends. I want to have someone message me. I want to laugh and share funny stories and meet up with someone. Not someone I'm having sex with, not a date, just a friend. And be the person that gets invited to things. Be the person that someone messages when they want someone to talk to.

But I'm 28 and just have to accept that isn't going to happen. That's something I'm not going to experience and be ok with what I have.",1,1733471629.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

Either dry patches or weird bubbling with little “pimples” where if I squeezed them clear liquid would come out (I don’t regularly squeeze them but you know when I first got them and I was curious) 

It would come and go. I saw a doctor about it, multiple ones but just PCPs and one derm. They couldn’t figure out what was causing it, but didn’t really do much testing. Since this started, I’ve lived in two different states across the country from each other and a total of 3-4 different towns. I’ve changed products I use, whether for laundry or hand washing, etc. Played around with my diet, but still couldn’t figure out what causes the flare ups. 

UNTIL I realized… junior year of college was when I started drinking tea. Massive amounts of tea because it would be cold outside and I don’t really drink coffee and it was a nice hot beverage to have. I use standard metal tea kettle and drink black tea with honey. Usually most times I drank tea, I’d get rashes. But sometimes I’d get rashes even if I didn’t drink tea… 

Now, I treated myself on Black Friday to a Nespresso. I’ve slowly been getting into drinking coffee more. Nothing crazy just an occasional Starbucks here or there. I haven’t had the rashes in a very long time. And now all of a sudden, the rashes are back on my hands. 

I found this journal online about allergies to nickel and other trace elements that get released from kettles and coffee machines… could this really be my problem?

Also, I drink from a stainless steel water bottle Yeti and wear jewelry and use regular cutlery… so maybe some different trace element and not nickel?  ",1,1733471262.0,Allergies,0,1.0,False

It's nice because the instructions say roughly every 100 box of filters is when you need to clean it. Kinda simple way of remembering when to clean it. 

Second, how cool is it to watch the water and brew for the first time. Off topic, I'll have to say the machine is surprisingly light. It's not flimsy but I expected it to be much more sturdy feeling. The same with the glass pot, definitely feels more fragile than I imagined. 


Smell: smelled like coffee. No burnt smell coming from the cup, which was charming when I first started using Moka pots, but I've reached a ""pour, scoop, press"" phase of my life and coffee. 

Color: darker than I expected, but it was no grounds or visible heavy oils. Beautiful brown translucent color under the light. 

Taste: really smooth, not oily, and no left over grounds, but sadly as expected it was bitter. Very bitter. 


But, it's the best tasting bitter cup of coffee I've ever had. The cool thing is, is that I know that it only gets better from here. I'll use some fresh coarse grounds tomorrow around the same weight/scoops and I can already tell it's going to come out perfect. 

I'm not a coffee snob, but I'm sick of spending money on energy drinks because I hate using our moka pots. After 12 years I needed a break. I also needed larger quantities of coffee I could bring to work and drink over 12 hours. I've spent money on countless drip makers over the years and i like the idea of it being repairable. 


Super pumped about the next cup with more coarse grounds.",4,1733470878.0,Moccamaster,0,1.0,False

1h7w6uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_jacompas/comments/1h7w6uf/the_origin_of_haitis_name/,The Origin of Haiti's Name,"Haiti, known as **La Perle des Antilles** (The Pearl of the Antilles), holds a name rich in history and symbolism. Before European contact, the island was inhabited by the Taíno people, the indigenous inhabitants of the Caribbean. They lived peacefully on the land for centuries, thriving through agriculture and trade. In 1492, Christopher Columbus arrived on the island, which he named Hispaniola, unknowingly marking the beginning of a tragic chapter in its history. The Taínos, who had welcomed the Spanish explorers, were soon decimated by violence, forced labor, and diseases brought by the Europeans.

Following Spanish colonization, the French took control of the western part of the island in the mid-17th century, establishing a profitable sugar and coffee plantation economy reliant on enslaved Africans. This brutal system fueled the French empire’s wealth while subjecting the enslaved people to unimaginable suffering.

However, Haiti's history took a revolutionary turn in the late 18th century. Inspired by the ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity, and led by figures like Toussaint Louverture, the enslaved Africans rose up against their French colonizers. In 1804, after years of war and sacrifice, Haiti became the first country in the world to successfully overthrow slavery and colonization, marking the beginning of its independence. This victory made Haiti not only the first independent black republic but also the first successful slave revolt in history.

Despite this monumental achievement, Haiti's freedom has been met with constant adversity. The island has faced years of exploitation, political instability, and economic hardship, often at the hands of the colonial powers and later the ""Big Three"" (France, the United States, and multinational corporations), who have continued to impose their influence and control over its resources and policies.

Haiti’s name, a tribute to the Taíno word ""Ayiti"" meaning ""land of mountains,"" reflects both the island's majestic natural beauty and its people’s resilience. Yet, this legacy of struggle continues as Haiti fights to reclaim its dignity, independence, and the promise of freedom that was hard-won over two centuries ago.",1,1733470785.0,u_jacompas,0,1.0,False

1h7vyt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1h7vyt8/why_do_i_get_these/,Why do I get these?,"So here's my story. 2017 I had a bout of bigeminy. I went to the ER 4 times in 4 days and eventually they put me on metoprolol which essentially cured it. They gave me a cardiologist and the cardiologist said I should do more exercise and eventually I could ween myself off.

He was right and things went well.

Eventually I started drinking coffee again and everything was ok. Once per year, or when I'd change the oil in my car, or paint my house I'd have a good 20-30 second bout and it would be over. I figured VOCs, chemicals, and lack of O2 were a culprit.

No big deal. They come and they go. Sometimes I'd have them when I'd be fasting and suddenly have a coffee or I'm doing something else that was stupid and obviously bad, but I could handle it.

A few months ago I start playing Rimworld and, boom-boom, I have a bout. I don't really worry about it and it mostly goes away. But it doesn't. They come back later in the day one at a time.
The next day the same thing happens. A 10-15 second bout followed by one heartbeat PVCs later on.

I turn my hvac off and put fans in my windows since it became seasoning cooler and my PVCs disappear. I'm drinking coffee and living my life the same as before. So I decide to experiment. What happens if I start my hvac again, bang, they come back, but instead of a bout, they come back one at a time. Sometimes kind of hard which really takes it out of me.

Anxiety is not a trigger. Loud sudden noises or overall stress doesn't do anything to me.

However, I do have a twitching on my left eye that comes and goes. Quitting coffee reduced their intensity, and I feel like there's slight cramps in my calves when I'm going to sleep. I started supplementing magnesium and potassium to not a great effect.

I get back on metoprolol and it helps a little. My fiance tells me to count my PVCS(I know some people would find this silly), but I count them for about a week. I count and on my good days it's at about 11-12 throughout the day. On my bad days I'm up to about 20.

A few patterns emerge. Showering brings them on. Sometimes sitting in the car brings them on. Eating brings them on, especially sugar or carby foods.

So I'm convinced it's my house and the hvac, somehow. I move out of my house and I'm bouncing around airbnbs. Kind of stressful situation, right? But it feels like the number and intensity of the pvcs reduced almost immediately. I've been counting and I had a bad day of 4 really weak ones yesterday. 2 the day prior, and 0 the day prior to that. So stress isn't it. It's environmental.

I was eating dried dates the first day I had 0... not sure if that's significant, but it is what it is. I also took one of those emergen-c packets because I became ridiculously sick recently and as soon as I finished it I had a quite distinct PVC.

So I have a few leads and theories.

1. Lack of electrolytes of some kind. Why else would my calves slightly cramp and my eye twitch?
2. Lack of oxygen. I've had the eye twitching before at my old, old apartment. They used O3 to sterilize united being turned over and my eye would randomly twitch while I'd get kind of dizzy. That is kind of what happened for me there for a bit.
3. Some sort of chemicals from the hvac crawl space. The hvac probably has some holes in it and air gets in from the crawl space.

One thing is, my O2 levels aren't very low. My home where I experienced the issues I still had 96% O2, which is normal for me. I suppose some other gas could be high in my blood.

Anyway, do you have any theories?",1,1733469802.0,PVCs,0,1.0,False

Before meeting up with Claireese, I track Eight down, finding her in her room taking a nap. She comes to her door and opens it with a groggy expression to which I cross my arms and lean against the door frame.

“So when were you planning on telling us?” I ask.

She squints her eyes before rubbing the sleep from them, “What? What are you talking about?”

“I just talked to Lyle. He let it slip that you’re training our group for the surface?”

That wakes the captain up a bit, and though she looks a little caught off guard, she quickly pulls up a plain expression and matches my stance, “Yeah? What about it?”

“You aren’t all planning on joining us up there, are you?”

“And what if we are?” Eight asks me, “I didn’t realize you were calling the shots around here now.”

I back off a bit, “I’m not, Eight. Things are brutal up there, though. Val and I have been going out since the beginning and we’re still not even used to it yet. I literally had a heart attack a few cycles ago because of what’s going on up there.”

 She steps aside for me to enter and beckons with a nod. I step inside and close the door while she responds.

“Yes, Wes, that’s the problem. What you three are doing up there is way too much for you to handle alone—you *shouldn’t* be doing this alone. We all want off this mountain, we should all be pulling our weight to help out.”

“Captain we’re find doing this alone. It’s easier moving around up there with less people.”

“Maybe, but we watch you on the cams a lot. We’ve seen you guys struggling to get by compared to that bitch and her little monster. You need help, Wes. We aren’t even planning on traveling in a single group. If we split into smaller ones like you guys, we’ll cover more ground. I don’t get why you have such a problem with this now. You were more than happy to let me and thirteen come out with you before you started bringing that skin wearing thing toys.”

“Yeah, but that was just you and thirteen. You two know how hard it is out there.” I look over my shoulder and lower my voice, “And no offense to everyone else, but I don’t think they’re ready.”

“Mayflower wasn’t ready but you trained her. Your Dad, Paul and the pastor are all ex military in one of the most brutal wars of recent history. Every single one of us has seen what the world is now, Wes. We know what we’re agreeing to.”

“Well, what about Lyle? You should have seen how crushed he was that he’s going to be alone down here.”

“He won’t be. The doc is staying with him, and just like you, Val, and Claireese, we’re going in cycles. He’ll always have some people with him.”

I shake my head, “Eight, we haven’t even really figured out what the deal with the Sphinx is. We’re doing fine right now, I don’t see why you’re so eager to—”

“I don’t see why you’re so eager to keep throwing yourself at this alone, Wes!” Eight snaps a sternly, “It’s going to be the death of you; and believe me, there are ways to die that don’t involve losing your life. I know that you want to protect everyone because you’ve been through hell yourself, but I have too. I watched a team of fifteen people dwindle down to just two, and then, when it was my turn to bat—when it comes down to me to lead because nobody else can—I get us all stuck on this stupid ass mountain in a fate worse than death. Then, instead of being the one to find us a way out, I send two kids out like special operatives to solve things, only to watch them suffer over and over again. I can’t do that anymore, Wes, I… I can’t.”

That invokes silence in me as the captain shamefully stares away from me at a corner of the room. Eight is always so good at playing the tough guy that it’s hard to see when she’s coming loose. I swallow hard, then speak softly, “Eight, it’s not your fault that we’re here. If anything, I was the one to convince us all to go.”

“No, Wes. The vote was fifty-fifty, and I was the final call.”

“I voted to go around the dead zone, too.”

“Thirteen didn’t. He wanted to go straight through.” The captain falls back onto the couch and gives the coffee table a kick with her heel, “It should be him leading this group.”

“We don’t know how that would have gone. It could’ve been even worse.”

Wes! I—” Eight begins to snap before catching herself. She smooths the air with her hand as she takes a deep breath, “I’m sorry, I know you’re trying to make me feel better, but it just doesn’t help. I’m supposed to be leading you all, and something bad happened. That means that it falls on me no matter what.”

I stare at her plainly for a moment, then shake my head, “Well, that’s just dumb.”

“Wes,” She groans.

“No, I mean—why does that make any sense? That seems like a military way of thinking. Maybe that’s how it worked back then, but it just… that all fell apart fast once the world ended, captain. Obviously all of their systems and motto’s didn’t protect us all those years. It was you and Six and everyone else loosening your protocols and doing things like real people would. There aren’t any systems or hierarchies anymore. We look to you because you know what you’re doing, not because you got a fancy name stapled to your number. Because ultimately, that name really means nothing anymore when the people who made it up are long gone.”

Eight studies my face, but I can’t get a solid read on if she’s interested or bothered by what I’m saying.

I continue regardless, “How about we just say it’s both our faults and agree to disagree. Hell, we can even blame everyone else who voted out this way too. But you’re doing the best with what you have, Eight, and I’ve never one time blamed you for any of this.”

Eight snorts under her breath, “Yeah, that’s cause you like to blame *yourself* for everything.”

“Apparently, so do you.”

The woman with the fancy title stares forward for a moment, thoughts brewing in her head, before finally speaking again, “That was a pretty good little speech of yours, but it’s not going to convince me not to let anyone come up there with you guys.”

I bite my tongue and resign to defeat. Still, I try to meet her halfway, “Just wait until we talk with the Sphinx. Hopefully, we’ll be able to find our next heading, and then we’ll all know what we need to do. That way, it’s not just a bunch of us wandering around aimlessly, getting ourselves killed over and over.”

Eight shakes her head and rolls her eyes, “Fine. But I’m only giving you a few more cycles to see if your plan rides out. After that, we’re coming up whether you like it or not.”

“Deal.” I tell her. She sticks her hand out and I take it, shaking it before we fall back against the sofa together. “Hey Eight? Speaking of meaningless titles, what’s your real name? You shouldn’t have to go by that stupid number anymore.”

“Oh yeah? What if I like the stupid number?”

“Well, you should just tell me cause I’m curious, then.”

She turns to me with a smirk, “Wouldn’t you like to know.”

“Yes, ma’am, I would.”

She looks forward once again, deep in thought, considering it for a long while before saying, “Katie.”

I sit up fast, “*Katie?!”*

“Kate will do fine, thank you.”

“*Katie*?” I reiterate.

She turns to me with a glare, “Is something funny about that name?”

“No, no,” I say tossing my hands up and leaning back once more in amusement, “It’s just very… *bubbly,* compared to your personality.”

“I’m going to punch you so hard, Wes.”

Bear hoists the bike closer to herself and stares out at us, clicking her teeth together a couple times in satisfaction. This time, she doesn’t immediately stow herself away, and instead takes a long beat to look out at us. Feeling emboldened by the gesture, I speak.

“Bear, we really liked your little pet,” I tell her, pointing to her cave, “Would… it be alright if we came in and saw him again?”

“Fur boy,” Bear squeaks out.

“Right.” I smile, “Fur boy. Could we…?” I start, slowly taking a step forward.

Bear immediately lets a low growl escape her throat, to which I back off instantly and put my hands up, “Okay! Okay. Sorry! I didn’t mean to scare you. We’ll just head out, okay?”

Bear stares intensely, skeletal, skin-patched jaw clenched tightly, then finally slips back into the depths of her cave. I turn to Val and Claireese, to which the latter speaks.

“Still not quite on the list yet.”

“I guess not.” I tell her, looking back over my shoulder toward the cave.

The three of us start back toward Crescent Lake, heading for the ritzy resorts and houses far up the mountain for investigation. We agreed on something a little less intense this time, given the nature of our last expedition.

Val has a theory that since there was a road leading to the Sphinx compound, and since it seems like a smaller one that didn’t have housing in it, there had to have been scientists and P.A.P members living on the mountain. If that’s the case, then where else would the mega wealthy secret society be living if not the giant, isolated lodges and mansions far away from the rest of the resort?

We have to pass through a few cities to get over to them all the way over in Paradise, so we certainly have a far walk (on top of avoiding Sue’s group), but our plans change suddenly when something appears on the sound map and we duck into the ferns.

Whatever it is, it’s human sized and low to the ground, moving through the brush like a snake in the grass. It’s not very fast, and its movement is choppy, but its path of travel is clear and direct in a straight line. It isn’t until it gets closer that we realize why that is.

It’s a hostess, and quite a grotesque one at that. The body that it sprouted out from lays backside up, the only part of it that reveals it was once human being the dead bloated eyes horrifically looking at the branches above. This one is composed out of human hands instead of full sized limbs, hundreds of fingers and palms twitching wildly in the air out of every orifice in the victim's body. It uses the limbs on its back and side to scurry along like a grotesque centipede, it’s thousands of fingers wriggling through the dirt and gripping at foliage.

Val and I stand, much to the dismay of Claireese. “What are you guys doing!?” she yells.

“These guys are weird on the mountain,” Val tells her, “They don’t target us like they usually do outside.”

“It’s heading somewhere like the others,” I note. “It’s moving in a straight line.”

Claireese stands alongside us, “Where is it going?”

“We have no idea,” Val tells her, “They all go without stopping though.”

Claireese watches it travel a little farther before taking off after it at a steady pace.

“Where are you going?” Val asks.

“Let’s change the plans,” she tells us, “I’m curious where this little guy is going.”

It’s not as simple of a plan as Claireese is making it out to be, but Val and I follow anyway, curious ourselves. Hostesses are usually fairly fast on their multi-limbed bodies, so this slow one is our best bet at figuring out where it’s heading without losing it. The problem is, hostesses don’t ever tire, and we do, so if it’s going far, we’ll have to find a way to pause it and rest.

Turns out, it was going far. *Very* far. We hike through the forest, following the creature until our feet are blistered and our bodies want to collapse. Val tries to keep track of where we are on the mountain, but as the hostess clambers to make it over all the rocks and slopes before us, we’re jerked around into disorientation trying to follow it. Those are the worst parts of the hike. The parasite easily hauls its way over the terrain, being made of nothing but climbing utensils. But when it comes our turn, we have to struggle to keep up, especially as the day winds on and we grow more fatigued.

Unable to take it anymore, we finally enact the plan we came up with in order to rest for the night. We ensure that our skin is covered thoroughly, then draw rope from our bags, running far ahead of the creature in the path that we’re sure it’s going to take. Standing between two trees, laying the rope across the ground, and waiting for it. It finally crosses our path and over the rope, which is when we act. Val and Claire crisscross each other, jumping over the beast and yanking the rope tight to catch it in a large loop. It tries hard to tug against its new binding, but with so many lumps and limbs around its body keeping it locked in, it can’t shake the rope.

My friends pull their twine tightly each around a tree, then hold it steady while I firmly fasten the rope to each trunk. When we’re done, we release everything, and breathe a sigh of relief as we watch our monster strain in place toward the horizon like a dog on a leash.

“That oughta’ work for now,” Claire can’t help but snicker at the absurdity of it all.

We take turns on watch that night, each greatly needing the rest after walking for so long. We didn’t even get much of a chance to eat, only able to munch snack food as we trekked. We also passed a single can of beans and a spoon between the three of us during a flat stretch of land at one point, but not much else. It’s the first run of good sleep I get in a long time, the sleet gently pattering the tarp we set up for shelter, so of course it would be interrupted during Val’s watch.

“Guys, wake—!"" is all she gets out before her voice is cut short.                 

I snap up fast and slap my pistol, raising it toward where I know she is. Claire does the same, and we instantly unload on the creature standing there. Its colossal hand is already tightly around her head, and at the first few bullets ripping through is skin, it yanks the girl upward in surprise. I hear a cracking sound that instills illness in my stomach before my waking daze wears off, and I finally find the mark on its small, deformed head. It lets out a pained, rage filled groan that’s silenced when Claire lands a shot herself.

The hulking thing tumbles back, but for how girthy its body is, it barely makes a sound as it crashes against the leaves.

“Shit!!” I mutter as I rush over to it, kneeling by Val. In case the sound of her neck breaking wasn’t a dead giveaway to me, the girl is already dead.

Claire approaches more carefully than me, not taking her pistol off the greasy, humanoid, brute's body, “It got her?”

“Yeah,” I grumble, shutting the girl's wide, terrified eyes softly. Even knowing she’s fine doesn’t make them any less haunting.

“What was that thing?”

“We call them Gasps,” I tell her, “They’re dead silent. Probably why Val didn’t hear it till it was too late.”

Claire sighs down at our friend's body and taps her gun to her hip, “Well damn. Should we just reset?”

I purse my lips, then shake my head, “Nah, Val will be pissed if we waste this chance. We should just keep going.”

“We can go right now if you want. I don’t think I’m going to be sleeping again after seeing that,” Claireese tells me, pointing at the hideous, bloated mug that’s been blown clean through. She turns to me after then continues, “Did you get enough?”

“Yeah,” I tell her, moving over to our hostess, still doggedly pulling at its bindings. I slice one end of the rope, then the other, to which it starts off again without hesitation, “Let’s get moving.”

My feet still ache fiercely as we trudge on again, but at least my muscles aren’t numb like before we rested. I’m just praying that our walk isn’t much farther. Talk is less that it already was now that we’re a person down, but that’s pretty normal while outside. Still, without death, we’ve been a lot more lax on that rule as of late, and with how bored we are?

Claire speaks up first, “How are you, by the way?”

I snicker, “What?”

“What do you mean what?” She huffs with amusement, “How are you? It’s been a while since you and I have just talked. I was enjoying your visits back before everything with our compound. Since we got here, though, you’ve been running non-stop, then in our downtime its usually training or business.”

“Well, Claire, I’m not doing too hot,” I tell her with a dark chuckle.

“Yeah, I honestly don’t know why I even asked.” She tsks.

“How are you doing?” I ask her back.

She nods, “Better. Than I was, I mean. As awful as the pain is when we die, I just like being out here with you guys, y’know? It was hard reconnecting and having you around before our neighborhood fell apart, then just not seeing you as much for those first few cycles. I know it was only a few days, but… time just feels longer since it all just sort of… you know. Stopped.”

“I’m glad you’re here too,” I tell her, turning so she can see my visor, “I mean that. I was missing you too.”

“Well, I never said I *missed* you, Neyome. I said it was hard.”

“Oh, whatever,” I chuckle, “Clearly you were lost without us.”

“Clearly.” She teases.

“You doing okay otherwise?” I ask, “I know this has all been a lot of change super fast. Not everyone is taking it so well, it seems…” I say, thinking back to Lyle and Eight— or *Kate*. Oh my God, they rhyme… I can’t wait to tease her on that one.

“Yeah, I think so,” Claire nods, “I mean, it sucks. All of this sucks. Honestly though? Not so much the mountain part. I still just can’t stop thinking about what happened back at our compound.”

A dark cloud sets over the conversation, but I don’t let it slow things, “Yeah. Honestly with how insane it all was, I don’t know if my brain has even stopped to fully process that whole ordeal.”

“I miss Nora a lot,” Claire sighs fondly, “It was so cruel the way she went out…”

I suddenly remember Claire telling me back then how much the woman had meant to her, and I can’t believe I hadn’t even made time to talk to her about this yet. “I’m really sorry, Claire… She was… I don’t even know how to describe that woman. I don’t know how someone could be so pure. Especially during all of this.”

Claire shrugs, “She was just amazing like that. I guess she’d just seen it all and decided being cruel wasn’t worth it. She was the closest thing to a real parent I’d ever had.”

“I’ll bet you were pretty close to a daughter to her too, Claire.”

Claireese snickers, “Yeah, but she was like that with everyone. She’d always ask about you and Val even before the Vanishing when I’d visit. Even though we’d drifted apart, she still thought that we were the same little kids running around and playing.”

“I bet she’d be happy to see us now. Well, maybe not under the circumstances, but…”

“Yeah, probably not,” Claire chuckles, “She talked about you all the time, you know.”

My heart sets heavy with grief. The poor woman that I never got to visit again. Whose story I never heard the end of. If I could go back and change things, all that time spent laying in bed doing nothing but sulking… I could have used it to go see her again.

I run my hand up my arm, stopping at the side of my bicep to feel the patch of my jacket, “I have no idea why she liked me so much. I was so awful to her. She tried and tried with me and I’d always just shut her out like I did with everyone. Did you know she gave me this jacket?”

“Really?” Claire questions, “It’s a nice jacket.”

“Yeah,” I tell her, “I had torn my old one, and the first time I saw her after that, she gave me this new one. It was her husbands.”

Our steps fall to silence, along with the scurrying of our guide up in front of us.

“I’ve been thinking a lot about Trent lately too,” Claire mutters, “Although, that’s nothing new, I suppose. He doesn’t leave too often.”

“What’s the new stuff, then?”

Claire shakes her head, “Just—this. This whole stupid Vanishing thing. I can’t believe that he… he’s just gone. Because these dumbass scientists wanted to play God, we lost everyone we cared about. And that Mason guy, I just don’t understand. Why did his stupid demon take Trent, but not me?”

I let my boots brush past a couple ferns before answering, “The Guide… the thing that took everyone? Mason told me a bit about it before he died. He said it was the first thing to come through when the P.A.P finally broke through to the other side.”

Claire looks at me but doesn’t interrupt.

“the Guide, it was some weird perversion of joy or something? Honestly, I’m still not too sure on that part. But Mason told me that when it came through, it was able to spirit away anyone who was… well, not like you or I. People who were happy, I guess.” I can feel myself starting to lose steam and ramble, so I shake my head and close my eyes to focus, “The reason I bring all of this up is because I used to feel the same about my mother constantly. It was so hard wondering why she got taken instead of me. But learning that about the Guide—”

I shake my head then turn to her again, “If they got taken, Claire, it meant they were happy. It meant you made Trent so unbelievably happy.”

I’ve really grown to hate the helmets, the way they don’t allow me to see people’s faces and emotions. I can’t tell if what I’ve said makes Claire feel better or worse, or if she’s crying or angry right now. She doesn’t help with her response either.

“You killed that thing, right? The Guide? Outside of this place, it’s dead?”

I nod, “And once we get out of here and all the sundance dies, it’ll be dead for good.”

Claire looks forward and curses under her breath, “God, I hate that I’m addicted to that shit it made from everyone. I hate that when you said that just now, it actually made part of me sad.”

“It’s literally designed to, Claire; that’s not on you. It’s made up of all the good things it stole from everyone. When I killed it, though, I saw it bleed out. I watched it all float up to where it belonged.”

Claire lingers long on that thought, letting a couple yards pass between her and her old self before softly saying, “Good. That’s good.”

I give her another few moments to grieve in silence, but I can sense that she feels things getting a little too mushy and personal for comfort, so she quickly tries to deflect, “Hey, thanks for that, by the way. Saving the world from extinction and all that.”

I snicker, “Claire, you don’t need to thank me for that. It kind of benefitted me too.”

“Yeah, but I still feel like we kind of owe you a big one. And don’t act like you weren’t ready to die for the rest of us. If you really would have, you wouldn’t have even been around to see the benefits.”

“Yeah, well, it wasn’t just me,” I sigh, looking over my shoulder back the way we came, “I would have never made it anywhere without Val. Even before that day, I would have died so many times.”

Claireese chuckles to herself, then, within the laugh, soflty murmurs, “Hey speaking of…”

I wait for her to continue, but after a few moments, it becomes obviously that she’s changed her mind about whatever she was going to say, and is now hoping I didn’t hear her. I prompt her forward:

“Speaking of…?”

“Oh,” she feigns innocence, acting as if she zoned out, “I was just going to ask when you two are finally going to make things official.”

The sentence slips into my ears then turns to lead, sinking as a lump in my throat and landing heavy in my stomach. “What?” I ask, hoping she meant something else.

“With Val? When are you two finally going to hook up? I mean, jeeze, Wes, you two are practically together already.”

“Man, I just can’t escape it lately, huh?” I mutter so that only I can hear.

“What?”

“Nothing—We’re not together. N-not *practically* together, I mean. We’re just friends, Claire.”

Claire scoffs and adjusts the strap of her pack back onto her shoulder, “Yeah, alright, Wes. You two literally cuddle every night.”

“You sleep up against me sometimes too,” I point out.

“Yeah, but not like she does.”

“It’s just how Val is. Her love language has always been physical touch.”

“*Love language?”* snorts Claireese, “Um, I think that says it all.”

“No, that’s not—Have you ever heard of the Gary Chapman love languages?”

“No, but I’m not going to let you explain cause’ you’re avoiding the question right now.”

“I’m not—look, there’s nothing going on with Val and I! This is the way we’ve always been, it’s nothing new.”

“God, I would pay to see how red you are under that helmet right now.”

“I mean it.”

“Oh, yeah?” Claire taunts, switching her voice to a mimic of Val’s, “You’re the best pillow, Wes! Oh, don’t deny it!” She steps close and leans against me, then talks in a baby voice, “You *like* it when I lay next to you and just *snwuggle awll cwose!”*

I shove her off, in playful annoyance, “You heard that?”

I can practically hear the girl rolling her eyes, “Um, yeah? I told you; you guys aren’t as quiet at night as you think. You think that’s normal for a friend to say, Wes?”

I’m about to respond, but just then, we finally crest the top of the slope we’ve been walking. Claire is looking at me to see my reaction so she doesn’t notice it, but I see what comes into view, and my mouth practically drops.

“What the hell…” I whisper in fascination.

Grind size

Would be great if it this was done like an “if this then that” flow chart.

It could focus on the start where you first look at the process, caff/decaf, altitude, roast level etc to give you a good starting point then take you from there.

I appreciate lance and a lot of experts have written/spoken extensively on this but was hoping if the “cheat sheet” easy to glance through version existed.

The [marginalia](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/1h7inyr/marginalia_read_the_world_timorleste_beloved_land/) and [schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/comments/1gnt6r5/schedule_read_the_world_timor_leste_beloved_land/) can be found here.



I've attempted to pick out the important bits in the following summary of chapters, and the questions will be in the comments.  

  


**Prologue** 



Gordon Peake arrived in Dili in 2007, initially tasked with researching the fate of Timor-Leste's independence fighters after the country had finally gained its freedom.  He describes seeing the Timorese elite, who would have been armed marauders during the 2006 crisis, but had now become leaders of companies, driving expensive cars and securing government contracts to repair the very damage caused by the conflict. 



For the author, Timor-Leste evoked memories of his own homeland, Northern Ireland - another small, divided territory shaped by colonial rule and conflict.  Both places were shadowed by historical struggles: Portuguese colonisation and Indonesian occupation for Timor-Leste, and division  for Northern Ireland.  The Timorese call their country rai doben - “beloved land”—a testament to their resilience and enduring hope as they rebuild their fractured nation.



A planned four-week stay turned into four years, as he found not only a deeper purpose but also love and happiness in this young nation.

  


**Chapter 1 - the Portuguese Monument**



The Oecusse district is an enclave of Timor- Leste surrounded by Indonesia.  The [monument](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monumento_de_Lifau) on the coast at Lifau marks the place of landing of the Portuguese in 1515.  They had seen profit in the sandalwood and bees.

  


Written history of Timor-Leste was extremely difficult to find, and the author eventually found a man called Kevin Sherlock  who lived in Darwin, Australia, and had an impressive record of documents pertaining to history.  His books were like a timeline of Timorese history, and included books on the [‘Balibo Five’](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balibo_Five), a group of Australian and New Zealand journalists who were murdered by the Indonesian army, and the subsequent cover-up by both the Australian and Indonesian governments.



[Portuguese colonisation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Timor#:~:text=On%2028%20November%201975%2C%20Fretilin,should%20become%20part%20of%20Indonesia.) ended in 1975, followed by civil war, and a short-lived republic which was ended by the [invading Indonesian army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_invasion_of_East_Timor).  Timor-Leste once again declared independence in 2002, but in 2006 United Nations forces had to return to secure the country when the army and police were battling in the streets.



Portuguese management of the island had not been smooth.  Similar to England with Australia, they used the island to get rid of criminals and political agitators. Always threatened by the ambitions of the Dutch, they established a settlement in Dili, in the east.  Their hopes rested on the coffee bean which they gave to the local kings expecting to receive the profits.  This didn't go to plan and ended in tribal wars.  Dom Boaventura became a national hero when he led a [revolt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timorese_rebellion_of_1911%E2%80%931912); his troops were eventually beaten by the Portuguese.



The author learned about local customs, and although Catholicism was still the dominant religion, ancestor worship was still important.  One ritual was that the family name determines which foods you may eat.  The Portuguese influence is significant - babies are baptised with Portuguese names and the law is written in Portuguese. 

  


**Chapter 2 The Testaments of Rogerio Lobato**

  


After a brief stint in government in 1975, [Rogerio Lobato](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rog%C3%A9rio_Lobato#:~:text=Rog%C3%A9rio%20Tiago%20De%20Fatima%20Lobato,Special%20Administrative%20Region%20of%20Oecusse.), with his criminal history, was going to run for presidency.  Gordon Peake met up with him and they had a long discussion.  He talked about his life and the history of the country.  He and his brother were members of the FRETILIN party ( Revolutionary Front for an Independent Timor-Leste).  [Jose Ramos-Horta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ramos-Horta) was one member of the party who went on to become future president and Nobel Peace Prize winner. 



The party declared independence, raising a hastily designed flag that had been sewn up the night before.  The ceremony was filmed by [Jose Alexandre Gusmao](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanana_Gusm%C3%A3o), later nicknamed Xanana, and becoming the symbol of the Timorese resistance.  Although they were young and idealistic, they lacked personnel and experience, and this resulted in an Indonesian take-over with the USA and Australia turning a blind eye, fearing the creation of a communist outpost.  Rogerio escaped, and the Indonesians killed his family.



Rogerio continues his story - in 2002 he became Interior Minister, with no idea how to perform the job, although he enjoyed the trappings however.  Gordon Peake discusses the importance of connections in how the country operated, a concept that international development agencies failed to understand.



**Chapter 3 - Down From the Mountains**

  


[Falintil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falintil) was the armed forces of Fretilin and these soldiers fought Indonesian forces over 25 years.  Hugely outnumbered, their activities were pushed underground, and they lived a rough life in camps and caves.  One of these fighters, nicknamed the White Bat, was an Australian who had ventured over there to fight for independence.   After pursuing him for years, the author finally caught up with him in Australia, and over many beers, he heard a collection of bizarre stories about the White Bat's time over there.  He learnt that the resistance fighters had lived through such trauma that they struggled afterwards.



[Jose Antonio Belo](https://www.smh.com.au/world/freedom-of-speech-fighter-20090131-7ufu.html) was a journalist friend of the author, who filmed and told stories of the Falintil and had consequently been imprisoned and tortured.  His recordings in this pre-digital age are rare pieces of documentary evidence.



He filmed the ceremony when Falintil became the official armed forces of the new state.  Members of the army were chosen based on both ability and subjective criteria.  Decisions were made by the Falintil high command and Xanana Gusmao.



The ideal of independence was different from reality.  Resistance fighters struggled in the administrative tasks needed to run a country.  They were bored and frustrated, and a group known as 'the petitioners' asked the president and prime minister to help.  They were snubbed, rioting broke out and the army was brought in.   Politicians, police and soldiers suffered infighting and the country became lawless.  The government requested an Australian-led peacekeeping force and an international policing presence to restore order.  The international approach of committees and reviews produced few results.  



Reconciliation between the Timorese soldiers and police eventually was reached as a result of a [shooting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_East_Timorese_assassination_attempts).  In 2008, the president was badly wounded, and Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao was shot at but escaped injury.  In trying to learn the truth of what happened, Gordon Peake spoke to [Marcelo Caetano](https://www.easttimorlawandjusticebulletin.com/2009/03/timor-leste-ramos-recognised-marcelo.html), the man charged with shooting the president, but did not gain any further information.  After the shooting, the army and police worked together to chase down the renegade soldiers, but those convicted were pardoned.  Many of the petitioners disappeared into obscurity, spending their money, and some went to Northern Ireland.  Gordon Peake was surprised at the lack of animosity between ex-petitioners and the current Timorese military.

President, mom and dad who had basically every calling. We were very perfect from the outside with all us kids going on missions, but honestly it was a really difficult childhood and they used a lot of scriptures and church teachings to guilt us into some difficult situations. Just for example, my older sisters and I were registered as dependents on our taxes for a long time because my parents wanted the tax break, and told us that if we decided to register otherwise, we would not be honoring our father and mother. Even though my parents are low key millionaires. 

Anyway, now I am living in Europe with my new husband where he is stationed for his military service. He is not a member at all and I stopped going to church the year after I got home for my mission 3 years ago.

1h7vg9d,https://i.redd.it/jvx260ycd65e1.jpeg,Can 2D motion design be interactive?,"
You know, when people hear ""2D motion design,"" they think, Oh, pretty graphics that move. But what if I told you, it could do more? What if 2D motion design wasn’t just a passive slideshow but more like...Tinder? Except instead of swiping on bad pickup lines, you're interacting with winking animations and clickable elements. That's right—interactive 2D motion design is the extrovert of the design world, making you part of the conversation, not just a viewer!


---

""When Animation Asks: 'Are You Still Watching?'""
Interactive 2D motion design is like Netflix, but way cooler. Instead of assuming you're zoning out on your couch, it pokes you (nicely) to get involved. Picture this: a product explainer video where you can click on parts of the animation to learn more. Want to know how that shiny coffee machine works? Just tap the steaming cup, and voilà—you're in a caffeine-filled adventure! It’s motion design that cares if you're paying attention.


---

""Not Just Eye Candy—It’s Eye Candy With a Purpose!""
Regular 2D motion design is like a donut—it looks good and leaves you happy. But interactive 2D? That’s a donut with a secret caramel filling you didn’t see coming. It grabs your hand (metaphorically, of course) and says, ""Let’s explore together."" From clickable infographics to gamified training videos, it turns ""watching"" into ""engaging."" Bonus: no sugar crash.


---

""Who Needs Textbooks When Your Training Video Talks Back?""
Companies are catching on. Employee onboarding? Pfft, why hand them a boring manual when you can give them an animated guide that reacts to their input? It’s like having a digital trainer that’s cooler than your average HR rep and definitely less awkward. And the best part? No need to raise your hand if you have a question—the design already knows where you're stuck!


---

""So, How Does It Work? Sorcery or Just Smart Coding?""
The secret sauce is combining 2D animation with user-triggered elements. Think hotspots, drag-and-drop features, or clickable layers. Tools like Adobe Animate, Lottie, and even After Effects (with some plug-ins) let you create motion designs that act like they’ve had their morning coffee—energized and responsive.


---

""Bottom Line: 2D Motion Design Didn’t Just Glow Up; It Leveled Up!""
Interactive 2D motion design isn’t just a trend—it’s the future. It's where storytelling meets tech, and where users don’t just watch; they participate. So, if your animations are still doing the same old linear moves, it’s time to add some spice. Because let’s face it—everyone loves a good visual, but everyone remembers the one that let them join the fun.

I know, it's kinda hilarious that I'm posting on here, but it feels like the right place, hopefully!

I've made some pretty significant changes in my life these past few weeks. Something has just clicked in my head and I'm suddenly able to do all the things that I need to. I was diagnosed with cPTSD and struggled with depressive episodes and anxiety. Could barely get out of bed, dead eyes kinda scenario. 

Won't get into too many details of what things were like, but things were rough. I lost a lot of weight and struggled to maintain any good habits. 

I've started journaling everyday. And exercising at home, just some old physio exercises that I stopped doing. I'm eating better. I actually went grocery shopping today and felt repulsed by a lot of the ultra-processed junk. I'm enjoying the process of making food to sustain my body as I have a fairly physical job. I quit smoking and vaping. I've been keeping my home clean. I almost hired cleaners in my depressive days, but I couldn't afford it and I was too embarrassed. I'm going out and meeting people. 

Now that I'm 30, it feels like I'm exactly where I need to be. I was lacking and not really doing what had to be done to function. It's kinda crazy what happens after the failure of a 6 year relationship. I'm excited for where this will take me. Sobriety is exciting for me. I was deeply addicted to nicotine and maryjane, but now I'm allergic to both of them. I rarely drink, maybe once a month, if even that.

This last week has been a bit of a doozy, but things also could have been worse... A man tried entering my home in broad daylight, but the doors were locked. A terrible date. A minor car accident that I'm at fault for. My cat being rushed to the emergency vet because she licked a flower she shouldn't have (or that I should have thrown out, really...) Again, not great, but certainly could have been much worse. I've had a few moments this week of craving nicotine, but I refuse to mess up this quit. I want (close to) zero addictions in my 30s. I can't give up coffee, that's just cruel lol. 

Sorry for the wall of text. Just needed to get this out there. I'm stoked for this chapter in my life and to see how it goes. I just think it's hilarious that all of a sudden I'm waking up extremely early... Everyday now. I have this compulsion to buy an air fryer and a condo for some equity. I'm not quite at investing my money just yet, but I'm focusing on getting my finances in order now. What a time to be alive lol",1,1733467551.0,OVER30REDDIT,0,1.0,False

My boyfriend’s mom has made it clear from the start that she doesn’t approve of me. She doesn’t hesitate to use my neurodivergence and speech impediment as weapons, frequently calling me “slow” or “stupid.” She dismisses any of my aspirations and seems to believe my only purpose is to be a submissive housewife who serves her family.

Living under her roof for a year showed me just how controlling she is. I was expected to wake up every morning at 6:00 AM to make coffee for the entire household, pack my boyfriend’s lunch, and then clean. Despite the house being packed with clutter, I was still required to clean it nearly every other day. I was always being called “lazy” or “entitled.” Rumours, complaints and gossip would happen behind my back and I would not even know about this one-sided hostility as she is very two-faced. I always hear the tea from boyfriend. 

Her criticism wasn’t limited to housework. She openly mocked my neurodivergence, telling me I’m too “slow” to ever work or succeed in life. This, despite the fact that I’ve held jobs before and handled responsibilities well. One time, when I was sick and couldn’t pack my boyfriend’s lunch, she accused me of abusing him because he had to do it himself for that one day. 

Her control over her son is even more alarming. Though he’s an adult with a job, she takes most of his income and assigns him the bulk of the physical labor around the house. When he brought up the idea of moving out, she responded with guilt trips, manipulation, and even threats, ultimately coercing him into staying. She outright declared, “Over my dead body will he marry you,” showing how little she values our relationship.

I decided to leave this toxic situation because it was clear that nothing I did would ever be good enough for her. I gave my boyfriend the freedom to decide whether he wanted to join me in leaving her home, but her controlling grip has made it almost impossible for him to break away.

Her need for control has damaged our relationship and taken away her son’s independence. She treats us like children who owe her obedience rather than adults capable of making our own decisions.

It's not often that I feel the need to get everything done all at once. Until 5:00pm, I had 1 cup of coffee, 1 apple, and a carrot. But I was still full of energy--anxious energy. I realized later I said the same thing twice during a call at work. And I felt like I needed to get everything done. 

I was hungry but not interested in eating. I was thinking so much (kinda still am). My chest was tighter than normal, and even though I started to get tired it felt like I was on a train and along for the ride. 

I'm now exhausted but worried still. I'm sure I'll sleep soon, but this burst of energy got away from me (even though I was tired while energetic, if that makes sense). 

I did enjoy being productive. I didn't enjoy feeling like this may be something more than my normal anxiety. 

I've been skipping some of my medication because I'm waiting on a refill (already called my pharmacy). I'm not manic but I'm exhausted and my mind is still going.

**Q&A**

**Thank you for agreeing to this Q&A. Before we start, tell us how have you been?**

I’ve been doing very well, thank you. It’s been a busy year! I published my first book, My Boss is the Devil (MBitD), almost a year ago. Since then I’ve been working hard on releasing the next two in the series, narrating and producing my own audiobook for MBitD, and writing the draft of another unrelated novel. On top of having a day job, being a father, a partner, and cat-dad, it’s been a lot.

**What brought you to** r/fantasy? **What do you appreciate about it?** 

I joined a number of sub-reddits in my journey as an independent author, and r/fantasy was definitely going to be on that list. I appreciate the broad spectrum of interest in the group, there are a lot of different tastes when it comes to the many flavors of fantasy and everyone can find a new book to love or talk about their favorites here. I hope to engage more with the community! I only found it a few months ago and I’ve been head-down getting my latest books out.

**Who are your favorite current writers and who are your greatest influencers?** 

My tastes tend toward urban fantasy, which is the main genre I write in, but I enjoy epic fantasy, sci-fi, and other genres as well. I honestly had no idea what litRPG was until I got into Dungeon Crawler Carl on the recommendation of a friend. Ironically, I’ve been catching up on a lot of the classic urban fantasy that I enjoyed a number of years ago so I’ve not had a chance to read as many current writers as I’d like. So for now I’d say some of my favorites are Matt Dinniman for DCC, Dennis E. Taylor for his Bobiverse books, and James S.A. Corey for The Expanse. I also adore the Laundry Files by Charles Stross, though that’s closer to the horror genre I guess. For a smaller name I’ve been working through the Soul Fraud series by Andrew Givler, on a recommendation from Reddit, and have a TBR of independent authors a mile long that I haven’t managed to get to yet.

My greatest influencers are really some of the classics of urban fantasy. Jim Butcher and Charles De Lint to be specific. They are very different, but both are big in the UF world and I’d be hard pressed to not call them out for influencing my work. I’ve read so many books over the years, though, it’s hard to call out too many specific ones. I didn’t mention Butcher in my current writers because I honestly haven’t read much of his in the past few years.

**Can you lead us through your creative process? What works and doesn’t work for you? How long do you need to finish a book?**

First off, I’m a pantser with an outline. I can’t do full discovery writing, I need to have somewhere to point myself, but I don’t do extensive planning or plotting. My writing tended to follow the Save the Cat beats, when a friend introduced me to them, so I started using a beat sheet for the big plot points in my books. 

When I’m writing, I try to carve out time every day for it. It’s not always at the same time of day, or amount of time. I don’t tend to force myself to sit and write if it’s not flowing. My primary writing hours are in the evening, partly my schedule and partly by nature. Some nights I’ll come away with 2-500 words, others I’ll hit over 2k, but I tend to work in about that range.

I’ve been releasing books every six months or so. If recent history says anything about it, it takes me 3-4 months to draft a book. After that I either go right into self-edits, if I’m not involving alpha readers. Once I get through one or two rounds of revisions I tend to involve a few beta readers, to make sure everything works in the story and I don’t have any plot holes that I haven’t filled myself. After incorporating feedback from those readers, I send the manuscript to my editor. When she’s done with it, I incorporate those changes and then format the book myself. My partner, Kat, did the chapter art for my first three books so if that continues she’ll work on that until just before publication. I involve a group of advanced readers as well, to get early reviews ready for release of the book.

**How would you describe the plot of My Boss is the Devil if you had to do so in just one or two sentences?** 

Nick's mundane life as a barista is upended by a job offer from the Devil himself. Balancing good and evil, he'll need more than coffee to decide his fate.

**What subgenres does it fit?** 

Urban fantasy, and it’s on the “cozier” side. There’s at least a touch of “slice of life” in there, too.

**How did you come up with the title and how does it tie in with the plot of the book?**

It was a bit of a thought exercise. Something along the lines of, “What if my boss was the devil?” and then the very on-the-nose title came after that. It’s the main part of the plot, or at least a serious vehicle for it. Working for the devil allows for our main character to evolve. I will add that the title survived about ten years of opportunity to change it, but I loved it as it was.

**What inspired you to write this story? Was there one “lightbulb moment” when the concept for this book popped into your head or did it develop over time?** 

I was working a relatively dead end job when the idea came to me. Similar to the title I thought, “What if the devil made me a job offer? It’d probably be better than what I’m doing now.” The rest is a bit of history.

**If you had to describe the story in 3 adjectives, which would you choose?**

Funny, thought-provoking, and sarcastic

**Would you say that My Boss is the Devil follows tropes or kicks them?** 

I’d like to think that it kicks them, after following them for a very short time. Subverting expectations on a story about a guy making a deal with the devil is important, because it’s definitely been done before.

**Who are the key players in this story? Could you introduce us to My Boss is the Devil protagonists/antagonists?** 

The main protagonist is a young barista named Nick. In a way, we’re all Nick. He’s working a dead-end job with a boss he doesn’t like, not having the impact he would like to make on the world. He’s a bit of an every-man, in that he’s relatable and experiencing the world in a familiar way. 

The devil, who you’ll meet at Lu, is an agent of change. Whether he ends up being an antagonist, the reader will have to decide, but he definitely doesn’t want you to think that he is.

Rob, one of Nick’s friends, is a heavy-metal loving Satanist who wants to call up dark powers. He’s the leader of the group attempting to summon the devil very early on in the book.

Amy, another of Nick’s friends, is a goth witch who is part of the crew attending the summoning in the graveyard. Definitely love interest material, so you’ll have to see what happens there.

There are a number of other characters, but these four are central to the story and you’ll meet them (and a few others) pretty quickly.

**Have you written My Boss is the Devil with a particular audience in mind?**

It’s written for a general audience, but anyone who has interest in stories taking Christian mythos and twisting it around will likely enjoy it. It’s a dark comedy, full of sarcasm, and people who like banter are definitely my audience.

**Alright, we need the details on the cover. Who's the artist/designer, and can you give us a little insight into the process for coming up with it?** 

I’m on a budget, so I’ve been working with [Getcovers.com](http://Getcovers.com) on all my covers. They’re a great group. Real designers, no AI, and as many revisions as needed to get the covers where I want them to be.

I had a very basic cover concept that I provided to the designer. Along with that I gave some notes on things I wanted to see. About fifteen revisions later and here we are!

**What was your proofreading/editing process?** 

I do a couple rounds of editing myself, but then I pay a professional editor for line/copy edits. Once I incorporate all those changes I also pay a proofreader to make sure there are no final errors.

**What are you most excited for readers to discover in this book?** 

I’m excited for readers to explore the line between good and evil, and the gray in between. Part of my enjoyment in writing these books is surprising the reader with some deeper questions, and I hope it makes them think.

**Can you, please, offer us a taste of your book, via one completely out-of-context sentence?**
