1qq4zx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qq4zx5/kimi_k25_a_sonnet_45_alternative_for_a_fraction/,"Kimi K2.5, a Sonnet 4.5 alternative for a fraction of the cost","Yes you read the title correctly. Kimi K2.5 is THAT good.

I would place it around Sonnet 4.5 level quality. It’s great for agentic coding and uses structured to-do lists similar to other frontier models, so it’s able to work autonomously like Sonnet or Opus.

It's thinking is very methodical and highly logical, so its not the best at creative writing but the tradeoff is that it is very good for agentic use.

The move from K2 -> K2.5 brought multimodality, which means that you can drive it to self-verify changes. Prior to this, I used antigravity almost exclusively because of its ability to drive the browser agent to verify its changes. This is now a core agentic feature of K2.5. It can build the app, open it in a browser, take a screenshot to see if it rendered correctly, and then loop back to fix the UI based on what it ""saw"". Hookup playwright or vercel's browser-agent and you're good to go.

Now like I said before, I would still classify Opus 4.5 as superior outside of JS or TS environments. If you are able to afford it you should continue using Opus, especially for complex applications. 

But for many workloads the best economical and capable pairing would be Opus as an orchestrator/planner + Kimi K2.5 as workers/subagents. This way you save a ton of money while getting 99% of the performance (depending on your workflow).

There are plenty of providers for open source models and only one for claude (duh)

[Nano-GPT](https://nano-gpt.com/invite/mNibVUUH)

A provider aggregator. Essentially routing all of your requests to a provider in their network. This is by far the most cost effective way to drive opencode, claude code, vscode (insiders), or any other harness. For the cost of a one extremely large cup of coffee, $8/month, you get 60,000 requests/month. That is $0.00013 per request regardless of input or output size. To put that into perspective, Sonnet 4.5 would cost you $0.45 for a request of 100k in/1k out (small-medium codebase) and not taking caching into account. Sonnet is 3,461x more expensive.

Also you can use Opus 4.5 through nano-gpt at API rates like I do to drive the orchestrator and then my subscription covers K2.5 subagents.

[**Synethetic.new**](https://synthetic.new/?referral=KBL40ujZu2S9O0G)

This is what I would recommend for anyone needing maximum security and lightning fast inference. It costs a premium of $20/month ($10 with my referral), but compared to claude pro plan's usage limit, its a bargain. 135 requests/5hrs with tool calls only counting as 0.1 requests. This is the best plan for professionals and you can hook it up with practically any tool like claude code and opencode. Within a 10 hour period, you can use up to 270 requests which comes out to $0.002. Sonnet 4.5 is 225x more expensive.

Cheap, fast speed, $60/month plan gets you 1,350 requests/5hr, data not trained on

1qq4yri,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qq4yri/aitah_for_confronting_my_exgirlfriend_after_she/,AITAH for confronting my ex-girlfriend after she ruined my life?,"Throwaway because I’m not trying to have this linked back to my main and end up as “that guy” in my city’s gossip group. Also because I’m pretty sure at least one of her friends still lurks my socials like it’s a part-time job.

I already know how this sounds. I can hear the keyboard warriors cracking their knuckles: *“So you assaulted her beverage? Jail.”* Or the other camp: *“Spill the rest.”* I’m posting because I need a reality check. Like an actual one. Not the kind you get from your buddy who says “lol deserved” and then goes back to Doomscrolling.

I (30M) dated “Emily” (29F) for five years. We were the couple people pointed at and said, “That’s what stable looks like.” That was the image. That was the brand. We weren’t flashy. We weren’t social-media cringe. We were the quiet kind of happy. Or at least I thought we were.

We met when I was 24 and she was 23. I was working my first real job out of college—nothing glamorous, but steady. She was doing this “finding myself” phase that somehow required buying candles and drinking very expensive coffee. She was funny and sharp and had this way of making you feel like you were the only person in the room. She’d look at you like she was collecting details, like you mattered.

I ate that up.

The first two years were honestly good. I’m not going to rewrite history and act like she was a villain from Day One. She wasn’t. She did nice things. She brought me lunch at work sometimes. She remembered my mom’s birthday. She’d leave little notes—stupid stuff like “you’re doing great, handsome” on a Post-it stuck to my bathroom mirror.

That’s the kind of detail that makes the betrayal feel like a prank from the universe. It’s not just that someone hurts you. It’s that they do it while wearing the face of someone who used to kiss your forehead.

Anyway.

Around year three, I bought a house. It wasn’t huge. It wasn’t some influencer mansion. It was a modest place in a decent neighborhood. It had good bones and ugly carpet. It was the kind of house you can picture having a life in. I put the down payment together myself. I’d been saving since I was like 19 because my dad hammered into my skull that you don’t spend money you don’t have.

The house was in my name. The mortgage was in my name. The utilities were in my name. The deed was in my name. Every adult in my life told me, “Good. Keep it clean. Don’t mix everything.”

Emily moved in about six months after I bought it. It made sense at the time. We were serious. She was at my place 90% of the time anyway. She kept a toothbrush there, then clothes, then suddenly she’s basically living there and paying rent somewhere else out of pride.

We talked about it. We agreed she’d contribute to bills and groceries. We set up a joint account for “house stuff”—utilities, repairs, groceries, date nights. I kept my personal checking separate for my paycheck and mortgage payment. Again, I thought I was being careful.

This matters later.

The slow shift started so subtly I didn’t clock it until it was already a pattern. She’d be “out with friends” more. Always friends I didn’t really know. Always plans that were vague. She’d keep her phone face down. She got weird about me even glancing at her screen. Not in a “privacy is important” way—more in a “don’t you dare” way.

At first, I told myself I was being paranoid. People online love to say “trust your gut,” but they never talk about how your gut can also just be anxiety wearing a trench coat. I didn’t want to be the insecure boyfriend. I didn’t want to be controlling. I didn’t want to be that guy who turns love into surveillance.

So I swallowed it.

Then there were the little lies. Stupid lies. Like telling me she was meeting her friend Hannah and then later mentioning a detail that clearly happened with someone else. Saying she was at a certain restaurant but not knowing where it was on the street. Laughing too hard at her phone, and when I’d ask “what’s funny?” she’d say “nothing” with this look like I’d stepped on a landmine.

And the intimacy changed. You know that thing where someone’s physically there but emotionally they’ve moved three doors down? Yeah. She’d still kiss me, but it felt like a routine. Like punching a time clock. We’d have sex but it felt… distracted. Like her mind was running tabs in the background.

I tried to fix it like a normal person. I planned date nights. I took her to a weekend trip. I started cooking more. I asked her directly if something was wrong. She’d say no, everything was fine, she was just stressed, work was crazy, life is hard, blah blah blah.

If you’ve ever been lied to by someone who’s good at lying, you know the feeling. It’s like being slowly gaslit by normalcy.

Then came the moment where my brain finally snapped into focus.

It was a Tuesday. I remember because Tuesdays were my long days at work. I came home late, exhausted, and the house was too quiet. Emily’s car was in the driveway. Lights were off. I walked in and heard the shower running.

Normal.

Except her phone was on the kitchen counter. Not face down. Not in her hand. Just sitting there like it belonged to a person with nothing to hide. Which was… weird, because she’d been guarding that thing like it held nuclear codes.

It buzzed.

And I wasn’t trying to snoop. I truly wasn’t. But I glanced. Reflex. Like how you glance at a license plate when a car drives by.

The preview popped up on the screen.

It said: **“Last night was insane. When can I see you again?”**

No name—just a contact with a single letter and an emoji.

I felt my body go cold in this almost clinical way. Like someone turned the temperature down inside my chest.

I didn’t move. I just stared at it like if I stared long enough the words would rearrange into something innocent.

It buzzed again.

**“I can still taste you. Don’t leave me hanging.”**

That’s the moment you don’t come back from. Not because it’s the worst thing ever written, but because it’s undeniable. You can’t rationalize it. You can’t blame stress. You can’t blame your imagination. It’s right there, in black and white, in your kitchen, on the counter you wiped down last night.

I picked it up. My hands were shaking, and I hate admitting that, because I want to be the guy who stays steady. But I wasn’t steady.

I unlocked it.

And before anyone jumps me: yes, I know, “privacy.” I know. I also know that I was living with someone who was either cheating or about to, and her phone was basically screaming it at me.

The message thread was… a horror movie.

Not just one guy. Multiple. Different names, different emojis, different tones. One thread was playful. One was explicit. One was like a boyfriend-girlfriend vibe that made me feel nauseous. One was a coworker. One was someone she met at a “wellness class.” One was labeled as a woman’s name but was clearly a man.

And the timestamps.

Overlapping.

I sat down because my legs literally decided they didn’t work anymore.

There were photos. There were plans. There were jokes about me—*me*—like I was a cartoon character. Like I was an obstacle. Like I was the boring roommate paying the mortgage while she collected attention like currency.

I heard the shower turn off. I heard footsteps.

She came into the kitchen wrapped in a towel, hair dripping, face relaxed. And then she saw me holding her phone and her expression changed so fast it was almost impressive. Like someone slammed a door in her eyes.

“What are you doing?” she said.

Not “Are you okay?” Not “What’s wrong?” Not even “Why are you holding my phone?”

Just: **What are you doing?**

I stood up and I said, very calmly, “Who are they?”

She stared at me. Then she scoffed. Like *I* was embarrassing.

“You went through my phone?” she asked, like that was the crime of the century.

I said, “Answer me.”

And here’s the thing that haunts me. She didn’t cry. She didn’t panic. She didn’t try to deny it. She just… exhaled, like she’d been waiting to stop pretending.

“It’s not that serious,” she said.

Not that serious.

Multiple men. Months. Plans to meet. Sex. Jokes about me. And she said, “It’s not that serious,” like she’d been caught eating the last slice of pizza.

I asked her how long.

She shrugged.

I asked her if she loved me.

She paused, like she was doing math.

Then she said, “I care about you.”

The most soulless sentence in the English language.

I told her we were done. I told her to pack her things and leave. I was shaking now, full-body, because once the adrenaline hits you, your body starts making decisions without consulting you.

And this is where things stop being just heartbreak and start being… like a legal thriller written by someone who hates men.

She didn’t yell. She didn’t beg. She didn’t throw things.

She got dressed. Calmly. Methodically.

She walked into our bedroom, got her suitcase, started packing like she was leaving for a weekend trip. And while she packed, she said, “Okay, but you know I’m not leaving with nothing, right?”

I stared at her.

“What does that mean?” I asked.

She zipped the suitcase and looked at me with this smile that wasn’t a smile.

“It means you’re not going to just kick me out. I live here,” she said.

I said, “It’s my house.”

She said, “We’ll see.”

That night, I slept in my own bed and she slept in the guest room. Like roommates. Like strangers. Like a curse.

The next morning, I went to work because I didn’t know what else to do. I couldn’t call off forever. I couldn’t just sit in the house and stare at walls.

At lunch, I checked my bank account.

The joint account was empty.

Not “low.” Empty.

Every cent gone.

I logged into my main checking because I felt my blood pressure spike and I needed to see my mortgage money.

There were transfers.

Multiple transfers.

From my checking to the joint account, scheduled like autopayments, but they weren’t mine. They were set up through my computer at home. She had access. She knew my passwords because I trusted her. She had been moving money in small amounts for weeks, building up, and then the day after I confronted her, she pulled everything that was left.

I called her. She didn’t answer.

I texted. Nothing.

I left work early, drove home, and when I got there, the house was… wrong.

Drawers open. Closet half-empty. Her stuff gone. My laptop gone. My watch gone. A few other things that were “technically gifts” but really just expensive items she liked.

And on the kitchen counter, there was an envelope.

Inside was a note, written in neat handwriting like she was leaving instructions for a pet sitter:

**“Don’t contact me. I’ll have my lawyer contact you.”**

I swear to God, I sat on the floor and laughed. Not because it was funny. Because it was absurd. Because my brain didn’t have a category for “the person you loved is now your enemy and also apparently a villain.”

Two days later, I got served.

She was claiming… a lot. Not just the money. Not just personal property.

She was claiming the house.

I won’t pretend I’m a legal expert. I’m not. But apparently, in my state, there’s a nasty combination of factors that can create leverage: cohabitation, shared financial accounts, documented contributions, and something about “reliance and equitable interest.” The point is, she didn’t have to be on the deed to make my life hell.

And she did.

My lawyer (who I hired with money I didn’t have, because what else do you do?) told me, “This is going to be ugly.”

And it was.

She dragged it out. She filed motions. She “forgot” documents. She claimed things that were easily disproven, but disproving them cost time and money. She used the system like a weapon. Every time I thought, *Okay, surely now there’s no way…* there was another thing.

At some point, my lawyer said, “We can fight this for years, or we can try to settle.”

Settle.

I remember staring at him in his office, fluorescent lights buzzing, and thinking, *How do you settle with someone who burned your life down?*

But then he showed me the math. Legal fees. Court costs. The likelihood of different outcomes. The fact that judges don’t like “he said she said” and Emily was very good at presenting herself as a calm, reasonable victim.

And I was… not calm. I was exhausted. I was furious. I was unraveling.

I tried to keep the house. I tried. I cut everything else. I offered her money. I offered her furniture. I offered her the car. I offered her anything.

She didn’t want “anything.”

She wanted to win.

Eventually, it came down to this: I either drained myself completely fighting, with no guarantee, or I accepted a settlement that… still makes me sick to type.

I lost the house.

Not in the sense that she “won it fair and square.” In the sense that she used a legal loophole and my lawyer basically said, “We can’t bleed forever.”

The day I handed over the keys, I felt like I was leaving a piece of myself in the doorway. I stood on the porch and stared at the paint I had chosen, the porch light I installed, the stupid little garden bed I built with my own hands.

Emily wasn’t there. She sent someone else. Like I was nothing.

I drove away and I didn’t know where I was going to sleep.

That’s not metaphorical. I mean literally.

For two weeks, I slept in my car in a parking lot behind my job. I showered at a cheap gym. I wore the same few outfits. I kept my important documents in a backpack like I was a transient.

And the entire time, my phone would buzz with notifications—automatic payments failing, credit card minimums due, bank alerts, emails from my lawyer, more paperwork.

It was like drowning and still getting spam texts.

My parents wanted me to come home. Pride wouldn’t let me. Not at first. Eventually, I crashed on a friend’s couch, then another friend’s, then rented the cheapest room I could find in a stranger’s house. It was the kind of place where you can hear someone breathing through the walls.

I was humiliated.

And the worst part? People didn’t know. Not really. On the surface, it was “we broke up.” If I said she cheated and stole money, some people believed me. Some people didn’t. Some people did that thing where they nod politely but you can see them thinking, *There’s always two sides.*

Emily, meanwhile, played the victim online. Cryptic posts about “healing.” Quotes about “narcissists.” Self-care nonsense. Friends commenting “You’re so strong 🥺” like she’d survived a war instead of causing one.

I stopped looking. It was poison.

Here’s where the rebuilding starts, and this is important because it explains why the matcha thing mattered.

After the legal mess, after the couch-surfing, after the car-sleeping, I hit this point where I realized: nobody was coming to save me. No hero. No karma. No cosmic justice.

Just me.

So I worked.

I got a second job. Then a third. Construction in the morning. Warehouse at night. Sometimes delivery driving on weekends. I did 16-hour days. I’m not exaggerating. I’d wake up in the dark, come home in the dark, eat whatever was cheap, collapse, repeat.

I stopped drinking. Not because I had a problem, but because I didn’t have room for anything that made me weaker.

I went to the gym because rage needs somewhere to go or it eats you alive. At first, I wasn’t even training for health. I was training because I wanted to feel in control of one thing in my life.

I tracked my spending like my life depended on it, because it did.

Slowly, my credit stabilized. Slowly, my savings rebuilt. Slowly, my body changed. Slowly, my mind stopped replaying the betrayal every hour.

It took years.

And I want to be clear: it wasn’t inspirational. It wasn’t a montage. It was ugly. There were nights I sat in a shower and just stared at the tile because my brain couldn’t handle being awake. There were days I wanted to text her just to scream. There were moments where I pictured myself showing up at that house and demanding answers like I was in a movie.

I didn’t.

I swallowed it. Again and again. Not because I’m noble. Because I knew any contact would pull me back into the mud.

Eventually, I got a better job. Not “rich,” but stable. I rented my own apartment. A small one, but it was mine. I bought a couch. I bought actual plates instead of eating off paper like a depressed raccoon.

I started therapy. It helped. Not instantly, but it helped.

And then one day, I realized I hadn’t thought about Emily for a full hour. Then a full day.

I thought I was free.

Until last weekend.

I was walking downtown after work. It was one of those crisp days where the air feels sharp, like the world is awake. I had earbuds in, but nothing playing. I do that sometimes because it keeps people from talking to me.

I was tired. Not in the broken way. Just normal tired.

And then I saw her.

Emily.

Walking like she owned the sidewalk. Wearing that effortless outfit that looks casual but probably costs more than my rent. Hair done. Skin glowing. Holding a matcha latte like it was an accessory.

And she was with a guy.

Her new boyfriend.

And I swear on my life, I am not saying this to be a douchebag: I am noticeably taller than him. Bigger. In better shape. I’ve been grinding for years. I don’t look like the guy she left behind. I look like someone who fought his way back from a hole. I was so much hotter than him it is crazy. I looked like a model.

He looked like a guy who thinks “going through something” is when Starbucks runs out of oat milk.

They were laughing. She was doing that little shoulder lean into him like she’s the cutest person alive.

And then she looked up.

She saw me.

I saw her face change in real time.

Recognition first. Then calculation. Then something like… guilt? Maybe. Or maybe it was just discomfort. Like she’d spotted a ghost she thought was dead.

We locked eyes.

For a second, time slowed in this ridiculous way. The city noise faded. My stomach dropped. My hands went cold.

And I swear to God, the thought that hit me was not “I miss her.”

It was: **She got to walk away.**

She got to walk away with my money, my home, and her reputation intact, and here she was—glowing and sipping matcha like she didn’t detonate someone’s life.

She didn’t even flinch. She didn’t look away. She just… watched me. Like she was waiting to see what kind of man I’d become.

And something in me snapped—not violently, not dramatically, but cleanly. Like a thread finally breaking.

I could’ve walked past her. I could’ve ignored her. I could’ve been the bigger person. I know.

But I didn’t want to be the bigger person in that moment.

I wanted one tiny, harmless, petty fragment of power back.

So I adjusted my path. Just slightly.

Not a sprint. Not a shove. Just a deliberate line change.

As we crossed, I angled my shoulder and “accidentally” bumped her elbow.

The matcha tipped, then spilled, then basically exploded. Green foam and liquid down her front, splattering her shoes, hitting the sidewalk in a messy splash.

Her gasp was immediate.

“—Oh my God!” she said, and then she saw me fully and her eyes widened.

She said my name.

Like she had the right.

“Please—” she started, and I don’t even know what she was going to say. Sorry? Wait? How are you? Don’t do this? Anything?

I didn’t stop.

I didn’t apologize.

I didn’t look back.

I just kept walking, straight ahead, like she was air.

Behind me, I heard her boyfriend say, “What the—?” in that confused tone people get when consequences show up unexpectedly.

Emily was flustered, scrambling with napkins, saying “It’s fine, it’s fine,” in that fake calm voice.

And I just… kept walking.

My heart was pounding. My palms were sweating. My brain was loud and quiet at the same time.

When I got to my car, I sat there for a full five minutes, hands on the wheel, staring at nothing.

I didn’t feel triumphant. Not really.

I felt… lighter.

Like I had finally acknowledged out loud, in the smallest possible way, that she wasn’t entitled to my decency.

And now, a few days later, I’m sitting here thinking: was that pathetic? Was that immature? Was that me finally turning into someone I don’t want to be?

Because here’s the thing: I’m not a petty person by nature. I don’t start drama. I don’t fight. I’m the guy who avoids confrontation, who pays his bills, who takes care of stuff quietly.

That moment wasn’t “me.”

But it also felt like it *was* me—the part of me that got buried under years of swallowing rage.

So. AITAH?

I didn’t hit her. I didn’t threaten her. I didn’t scream. I didn’t follow her. I didn’t ruin her life.

I just made her spill a matcha.

And yet… it was intentional. It was petty. It was a choice.

So tell me: am I the asshole for choosing petty, after years of being destroyed?

  
**TL;DR:** My ex cheated with multiple men, drained money, used legal leverage/loopholes to take my house, and I spent years working 16-hour days rebuilding. Ran into her downtown with her new boyfriend while she was drinking matcha. We locked eyes. I “accidentally” bumped her so she spilled it, then I kept walking without acknowledging her.

Yes you read the title correctly. Kimi K2.5 is THAT good. 

I would place it around Sonnet 4.5 level quality. It’s great for agentic coding and uses structured to-do lists similar to other frontier models, so it’s able to work autonomously like Sonnet or Opus.

It's thinking is very methodical and highly logical, so its not the best at creative writing but the tradeoff is that it is very good for agentic use.

The move from K2 -> K2.5 brought multimodality, which means that you can drive it to self-verify changes. Prior to this, I used antigravity almost exclusively because of its ability to drive the browser agent to verify its changes. This is now a core agentic feature of K2.5. It can build the app, open it in a browser, take a screenshot to see if it rendered correctly, and then loop back to fix the UI based on what it ""saw"". Hookup playwright or vercel's browser-agent and you're good to go.

Now like I said before, I would still classify Opus 4.5 as superior outside of JS or TS environments. If you are able to afford it you should continue using Opus, especially for complex applications. 

But for many workloads the best economical and capable pairing would be Opus as an orchestrator/planner + Kimi K2.5 as workers/subagents. This way you save a ton of money while getting 99% of the performance (depending on your workflow).

There are plenty of providers for open source models and only one for claude (duh)

[Nano-GPT](https://nano-gpt.com/invite/mNibVUUH)

A provider aggregator. Essentially routing all of your requests to a provider in their network. This is by far the most cost effective way to drive opencode, claude code, vscode (insiders), or any other harness. For the cost of a one extremely large cup of coffee, $8/month, you get 60,000 requests/month. That is $0.00013 per request regardless of input or output size. To put that into perspective, Sonnet 4.5 would cost you $0.45 for a request of 100k in/1k out (small-medium codebase) and not taking caching into account. Sonnet is 3,461x more expensive.

Also you can use Opus 4.5 through nano-gpt at API rates like I do to drive the orchestrator and then my subscription covers K2.5 subagents.

This was its response and hypothetical solution. What do you think is right and wrong about the response and solution?

⸻

1. Colonial history set things up badly

During colonial rule, many African economies were reshaped to:

	•	Grow cash crops for export (coffee, cocoa, cotton, sugar)

	•	Import food instead of growing it locally

After independence, a lot of those systems stayed in place. Land, infrastructure, and expertise were still geared toward exports, not feeding local populations.

⸻

2. Trade rules can punish local farmers

Global trade policies often favor wealthy countries:

	•	Rich nations subsidize their farmers

	•	Their cheap food floods African markets

	•	Local farmers can’t compete and go out of business

So even when African countries can grow food, it’s sometimes cheaper to import it, which slowly kills domestic production.

⸻

3. Debt and IMF/World Bank conditions

In the 1980s–90s, many African countries were heavily in debt. To get loans, they were pushed into “structural adjustment programs”, which often required:

	•	Cutting subsidies for local farmers

	•	Opening markets to foreign imports

	•	Reducing public investment in agriculture

That weakened food systems long-term. Some countries are still recovering.

⸻

4. Land grabs and foreign control

In some places:

	•	Foreign corporations or governments lease huge areas of fertile land

	•	Crops are grown for export, biofuels, or animal feed

	•	Local communities lose access to land they once farmed

This isn’t universal, but where it happens, it directly reduces local food production.

⸻

5. Climate stress + lack of infrastructure

Africa is hit hard by:

	•	Droughts, floods, desertification

	•	Poor access to irrigation, storage, roads, and fertilizer

None of this is about “permission,” but it limits capacity. Food rots before reaching markets, or farmers can’t survive bad seasons.

⸻

6. Political instability and corruption

Wars, weak governance, and corruption can:

	•	Disrupt farming cycles

	•	Divert agricultural funding

	•	Make land ownership unsafe or unclear

When farmers don’t feel secure, they don’t invest long-term.

⸻

Important myth to bust

“Africa can’t feed itself” — False.

Africa has:

	•	\~60% of the world’s uncultivated arable land

	•	Millions of skilled farmers

	•	Many countries that do produce most of their own food

The issue is systems, not ability.

⸻

The big picture

Global power structures, economic pressure, and historical exploitation often make it very hard to prioritize feeding local people over exporting crops or importing cheap food.

How can it be fixed?

A CONTINENT-WIDE ROADMAP TO END STARVATION IN AFRICA

PHASE 1: Stop the bleeding (0–5 years)

Goal: Make starvation rare, even during shocks.

What must happen everywhere

	1.	Food security as a constitutional priority

	•	Every country legally commits to food availability before exports

	•	Emergency grain reserves rebuilt (many were dismantled)

	2.	Protect staple food production

	•	Temporary tariffs on staple food imports where they undercut local farmers

	•	Guaranteed minimum prices for staple crops

	•	Input support (seeds, tools) focused on food crops, not exports

	3.	Debt relief tied to food investment

	•	Debt payments paused or reduced

	•	Savings legally earmarked for agriculture, water, storage

	4.	End aid practices that harm farmers

	•	Shift from imported food aid → cash + local procurement

	•	Buy food from African farmers during crises

📉 Impact:

Famine deaths drop sharply within 2–3 years

Local food production stabilizes

⸻

PHASE 2: Build resilience (5–15 years)

Goal: Make hunger unlikely even with droughts, floods, or conflict.

Structural fixes across Africa

	1.	Land rights reform

	•	Legal land ownership or long-term use rights for small farmers

	•	Special protection for women farmers (critical)

	2.	Water first

	•	Small-scale irrigation everywhere it’s feasible

	•	Rain harvesting, groundwater protection

	•	No more dependence on rain alone

	3.	Climate-fit farming

	•	Indigenous crops (sorghum, millet, cassava, legumes)

	•	Agroforestry, soil restoration

	•	Seed banks owned locally

	4.	Storage + transport

	•	Silos, cold storage, rural roads

	•	Cut post-harvest losses (currently up to 40%)

	5.	Regional food trade

	•	African food feeds Africa first

	•	Remove barriers between African countries before global exports

📈 Impact:

Chronic hunger reduced by 50–70%

Food prices stabilize

Rural incomes rise

⸻

PHASE 3: Lock it in (15–30 years)

Goal: Hunger becomes an exception, not a system feature.

Long-term continental shifts

	1.	Local processing & industry

	•	Milling, canning, drying, packaging done in Africa

	•	Jobs + food stability

	2.	Rebalanced trade

	•	Export value-added food, not raw crops

	•	Fair trade rules, not dependency

	3.	Political accountability

	•	Farmers represented in policymaking

	•	Transparent food budgets

	•	Corruption punished consistently

	4.	Urban food planning

	•	Cities supplied by domestic producers

	•	Reduced reliance on imports

📊 Impact:

Africa becomes a net food-secure continent

Hunger linked mainly to conflict or disasters — not normal life

⸻

What must change outside Africa (this part matters)

Ending hunger cannot be done by African countries alone.

Global changes required

	•	Cut rich-country farm subsidies that distort African markets

	•	Allow African countries to protect staple food sectors

	•	Stop land grabs and exploitative leases

	•	Restructure global debt systems

Without this, progress is slower — but still possible.

⸻

The uncomfortable truth

Africa could feed itself today if:

	•	Feeding people mattered more than export earnings

	•	Small farmers mattered more than foreign investors

	•	Long-term stability mattered more than short-term profit

Starvation persists because it’s politically tolerated, not inevitable.

⸻

Final, honest answer to “when?”

If this plan were seriously adopted across affected countries:

	•	Mass starvation: largely ended in 5–10 years

	•	Chronic hunger: mostly eliminated in 20–25 years

	•	Full system repair: one generation (\~30 years)

That’s not fantasy. That’s policy choice.

If you want next, I can:

	•	Show why this hasn’t happened yet

	•	Break down who resists these changes

	•	Explain what ordinary people globally can do that actually helps",0,1769681862.0,hypotheticalsituation,5,0.2,False

Private collectors are nodding at themselves in the mirror, finding joy and pride in sharing art with the masses.

It is October the 2nd, 2025. We are in Madrid, it is 10 in the morning,

# [Art Stock Exchange](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs5QGN-zhwM&list=RDBs5QGN-zhwM&start_radio=1)

Art loans and exchanges are highly sought after among cultural centers.

Museums have generally two distinct types of exhibition: the permanent collection and the temporary exhibition. As the names imply, the permanent collection is the mainstay, a core of art that serves as a cultural foundation to the place. Raphael's [Transfiguration](https://www.romewise.com/images/vatican-museums-pinacoteca-raphael-tryptic-small.jpeg) in the Vatican museum would be such a piece, as if the architecture itself with [the museum's spiral staircase](https://www.romewise.com/images/vatican-museums-spiral201-staircase-small.jpeg). By opposition, temporary exhibitions only exist in a specific timeframe.

Temporary exhibitions are a lifeline for the vast majority of cultural centers. The [Louvre ](https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp7534703.jpg)could simply rotate its massive stock on displays. As of today, only [8% its total collection](https://www.louvremuseumtickets.fr/fr/blog/visites-culturelles-et-thematiques/le-cote-secret-du-louvre-a-la-decouverte-de-la-collection-d-art-cachee-du-musee) can be seen, that's less than 50.000 art pieces out of 615.000 in stock.

Unsurprisingly, other museums rarely possess that amount in storage, yet they need to keep rotating their art on display to keep visitors interested in coming back. That's where loans and exchanges come in.

While it is the cheaper option compared to outright buying art, it is by no means cheap. Negotiation, transportation, insurance, installation, advertising campaign, rules of conservation... Put it all together and the cost quickly ramps up, whether you're dealing with another museum or a private collector. Nonetheless, it's this or risking a dwindling attendance level.

Back to Spain.

In Granada, near the sea, the [CajaGranada Cultural Center](https://www.tinostone.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1200-HEADER-centro-cultural-caja-granada-memoria-de-andalucia-br.jpg) has decided on a temporary exhibition. It will be called **Still life, the eternity of the inanimate**, and is set to start on October 9th 2025. One of its key pieces will be a Picasso painting, [*Still Life with Guitar*](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/948a886c-a506-458f-a2cb-a10b5af36bd0.jpeg?resize=980:*), created in 1919. Open your hand and look at it. If your hand is of average size, then the painting will be a little smaller, being only four by five inches.

That painting, along with 56 other pieces of art from the likes of [Juan van der Hamen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_van_der_Hamen) or [Fernando Botero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Botero), have been granted from a variety of private collectors.

The plan is simple:

Collect all the pieces in Madrid where most of the collectors reside, document the pieces, have them wrapped securely and stored from September 25th to October 2nd until they're all gathered. And from Madrid have a single van collect it all and travel down to Granada. [It's a four to five hours trip](https://img.asmedia.epimg.net/resizer/v2/RRQTLNKA2FD3DGORAX627RYPX4.png?auth=a02444655c85f9d8b2152c604379424361f0a48c6115514770ab07a2802add6b&width=1200). At arrival, unload, check the boxes, be done with it.

\-

The sun is high. Dolores is in her kitchen, the smell of coffee and good food fills the room. It is a clear and cold day outside. She steps out to grab the journal and see if everything is going fine in the building. It's her job, she's the concierge.

A motor rumbles. The heating is on, the driver is comfortable, the security van departs, it is filled to the brim with pricey art.

Museum curators are still crossing their fingers while art collectors are enjoying a priceless brandy in their comfortable leather chairs.

We are October the 2nd in the afternoon.

Such trips are always a stressful occasion for owners, curators, conservators, and everyone involved. Art is often old and fragile, and transport can do irreparable damage if not well prepared. Greed is another issue, *Still Life with Guitar* has been insured for about 650.000€. Try to sell your hand and see how much you get from it. And the painting is but one piece of a van stocked with 57 of them.

The van arrives at the CajaGranada cultural center at 10 a.m. on October the 3rd.

The packages are immediately unloaded in a secure room with active cameras. Hands are shaken, nods are given. It's always reassuring to see an art convoy arrive in one piece.

At 11.30 a.m. the transporters leave the center.

\-

Museums are often short on cash, even among the most visited centers in the world. The British Museum had to [close down galleries at the start of the century](https://www.thetimes.com/travel/destinations/uk-travel/england/london-travel/british-museum-is-denied-pound6m-cash-lifeline-klwqg2fsrtl), and still remains [dependent on regular cash injections](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgdwvw392wo). That's not even counting [staff going on strike for salary issues](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/british-museum-staff-plan-another-strike-2329603) and working conditions.

As a result, big and small museums resort to a random assortment of corner-cutting, which might have happened here. See, employees of the CajaGranada center noticed many packages and crates weren't properly numbered. Instead of looking at numbers on crates and checking boxes on a paper, they would have to open everything and sort it out again to ensure it was all there.

""Later,"" they said. The room is secure, cameras are everywhere, the exhibition isn't starting before October 9th.

It is Monday, the 6th of October. Later has come. Crates are opened, lists are rifled through, it is a mess of plastic, bubble wraps, and empty boxes. It is long, careful work. The last thing anyone wants is being seen by colleagues and cameras damaging a century old work of art worth 95 years of your salary.

Everything is ordered, numbered, double-checked. Triple-checked even, before being put on display.

Finally, everything's neat and tidy, ready for visitors. A curator walks through the museum, and lifts an eyebrow. One display is conspicuously empty.

At the quadruple-check, it dawns that out of the 57 pieces on the list, only 56 are present. *Still Life with Guitar* is missing.

""¡Vaya, vaya!"" someone exclaims, which can be roughly translated to ""oh dear!""

\-

Dolores wakes up, as she does every morning. It's good, it means she isn't dead yet. Days may be repetitive, but they are peaceful. She makes sure everything is tidy, says hello to residents and asks how the day is treating them.

The driver is at his van, ready for the next job. It is a repetitive job, but it pays the bills. However, there usually isn't a squad of policemen and policewomen knocking at the window.

""Hello,"" greets an unblinking officer of the law, ""you left on October 2nd in the afternoon for a five hours drive to the CajaGranada Cultural Center. Care to tell us why you arrived the next day?""

*Oh dear*, the driver must be thinking.

\-

When *Still Life with Guitar* was found missing, it was immediately reported to the police, and one art collector somewhere must have fallen from their leather seat. The police added the painting to the international database of stolen art and put the Brigada de Patrimonio Histórico on it. Art is very different to find a fence for thieves than, say, hard cash or a car. Sometimes it can be broken down to base parts like in the case of jewelry, sometimes it cannot, as is the case for paintings. The base material is worthless on its own. Even jewelry often has its parts so well known that experts can recognize a specific stone by putting it under a microscope. As such, the trajectory of stolen art is very different from other goods, and most countries have a specialized unit for it. Units that are also trained in the ways museums handle transfers and exhibitions to find weak-points and assess when and where the theft happened.

It is quickly proven through security cameras and restricted access that there was no tampering of goods in the storage room after the delivery and before art was put on display (October 3rd to October 6th). By all accounts, it happened before that.

Which leaves one question on everyone's lips: Why, with a payload worth millions and a drive that can be completed in a single day, did it require two days to make the trip?

The answer from the drivers sounds flimsy at best. They were tired and stopped at a hotel. One person slept while the other watched over the van, and they switched around in the middle of the night.

To say it's suspicious is an understatement.

The focus of the nightly stay and on the storage period between September 25th and October 2nd. The investigation is in full swing.

# [Get rich or get caught trying.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta3fJjdw2so)

Picasso's work has a history of theft. At this point you might call it a curse.

[In 2007](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-12-20/today-in-history-picasso-art-heist-brazil-2007/106143440), three dudes broke into the Art Museum of Sao Paulo's front door while the guards where changing shifts and left with Picasso's [Portrait of Suzanne Bloch](https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/pablo-picasso/portrait-of-suzanne-bloch-1904.jpg) made in 1904. The thieves were caught, and the museum announced it would install security measures similar to the Louvre. You know, the museum that just got millions of jewels stolen in mid-day in 2025.

Picasso's granddaughter also had[ two of his paintings stolen](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/01/artnews.france) in 2007 at her home in Paris.

In 1986 in Australia, a ransom note was addressed to the art minister after the theft of the [Weeping woman](https://www.pablopicasso.org/assets/img/paintings/the-weeping-woman.jpg) from The National Gallery of Victoria. The group responsible for the theft, dubbing itself the *Australian Cultural Terrorists*, wrote in the note that the theft ""involved less risk than shoplifting cotton hankies from David Jones,"" I have no idea what it means but it sounds fun. The thieves were never caught, luckily the painting was recovered.

Some 110 works of Picasso were also stolen in Avignon (France) in 1976.

You get the gist, Picasso's work has a long, long history with theft.

And I'm not being hyperbolic. According to the [Art Loss Register](https://artlyst.com/art-loss-register-lists-most-stolen-artists/), due to Picasso's prolific output combined with the associated price tag, he is the artist with the most stolen works worldwide, with over 1000 of his pieces having been stolen.

Naturally, the Granada theft sparked a debate.

One of so many.

Because when the Sao Paulo museum was broken in, a debate also started as it was discovered there was no security system at all at the time, and the art pieces weren't insured.

In Australia, the cultural terrorists' action wasn't to gain a large sum for themselves, but to gain an increase in arts funding and secure the lives of artists a little more.

And in Granada, it was found out that the pieces should have been inspected right on delivery. But instead, the delivery was signed off and the crew went on its merry way with the van.

So what to do? There have been obvious lapses in the process. In Spain, when the value of a payload passes a certain threshold, it becomes mandatory to use an armored security truck and the transport must be notified to the police. Armored vehicles can also be mandated on a case by case basis depending on the artwork transported. And if it can't be done in an armored vehicle, it requires at least two armed guards for transport.

But even that doesn't account for the guards themselves, proper rules of delivery and checking, the financial difficulties to ensure proper security, and so on.

At the Granada center, it took three days for the staff to find out the painting was missing. Three days, which is a *lot* of time for an art piece to disappear.

The nightly stop, the missing labels, the time between delivery and content verification. There were many lapses in security along the way, and some outrage came out of it. As it did in 2007, in 1986, or in 1976. Or in 2025 with the Louvre. Or in just about every other art theft case. Words were spoken, and so far nothing has changed. It rarely does.

\-

An art collector is eating his fingernails. 

So do the van drivers. And the museum accountant who has to foot the bill for the insurance.

Dolores is reading the journal, her nails are untouched. Her husband Armando, 71-years-old, is watching tv. It is the 22nd of October.

""Oh?"" Armando says, ""a Picasso painting has been stolen.""

Dolores lowers her journal. *Oh* indeed.

She brings her journal back up and keeps on reading.

""They should make their paintings bigger,"" Armando continues, ""it's so small, no wonder it disappeared.""

Dolores lowers her journal again. She gets up, enters her office, looks at the Amazon packages awaiting their owners. Sometimes, when a package isn't picked up, she tucks it safely at home as it waits for the owner. One of these has been there for a while. She's certain she picked this one up at the beginning of the month. She opens her hand, puts it on the plastic. Her hand is larger. She takes a ruler. Four by five inches.

She lives in a building in Madrid. Sometimes, the backrooms are used to store goods before transport.

Just in case, she calls the police.

Hours later, analysts have opened the package and are photographing the content in her garden. It is *Still Life with Guitar.*

The police is questioning Dolores and Armando separately. Of course she put the package in her office, it was against the wall outside her apartment, like all delivery packages. She's the concierge, it's part of her job to safeguard them. She thought it was a mirror.

For added fun, the police asks them if they have anything to do with the Louvre robbery that happened on the 19th of October 2025. You never know, Dolores and Armando might be important figures in an international art smuggling ring.

Questions go on and on, [the painting is inspected with more care than doctors handling you with your limited social security](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G4A2AeOXoAAv6hV?format=jpg&name=large), but the brigade soon comes to the obvious conclusion.

There never was a theft. *Still Live with Guitar* never left Madrid in the first place, and the whole debacle comes down to a mistake. The art was simply recovered by the neighboring concierge when the transporters left it in the doorway and Dolores mistook it for a normal delivery.

The painting was in the very building it had been stored in in Madrid.

\-

Dolores is back to drinking her morning coffee with Armando, the CajaGranada Cultural Center has recovered *Still Life with Guitar* and it is now the star of the exhibition, the drivers... I don't know if they are still driving if I'm being honest.

If a debate has been sparked about the security conditions of art in transport and storage, it died out as other news cropped up. It is a constant with museums, the question only ever comes up when something goes wrong, but rarely is there any action undertaken to resolve the issue.

But I've learned something. If I want to get rich, I need to keep my eyes peeled every morning for packages in the hallway. You never know when you might get a painting worth half a million. So far, I've only gotten a mirror. But one day, one day. 

Feels good to be almost rich, I can tell you that much.

You, and everyone who goes down this rabbit hole is going to be sorry....:



T-Minis Absolute Shotshow: Open on scene of 5 Points South. Crazy Pagan water fountain in front of a Catholic Church (you literally can’t make this stuff up). A not so young man dressed as an older man against duress makes his way to a Starbucks to get some coffee. Laughs and sends pictures to his family from Michigan about how the city is “rolling up its sidewalks” because it’s 31 outside (or whatever). James Spann is saying his infamous words, “dusting” — I harbor no resentment, this was insane. I get back to my office, bosses have clearly stated, “We’ll be fine. Everyone… BACK TO WORK!” We sighed and knew that this probably would suck.

Hour 1: Again, I worked at 5 points South, close to Highlands. My wife worked at the time for BBVA on Green Springs and W. Valley (it used to be an old grocery store or something). By the time we started seeing cars piling up outside our office (in 5 points (also no one downvote me for parenthesis. I’m in coding, I use them all the time in wrong places)), it was too late to leave. Well, at least by car. The one boss had left hours earlier to.. “get something from home”. The other ended up sleeping on a concrete floor in our office drinking beer with his employee. As for me and my other two coworkers, we both thought we could at least walk somewhere away from the insanity of 5 points… I know that sounds normal, but this was 5 points times 10. One of us was off to his house (off Green Springs) and the other was going to have his wife meet us at my wife’s office and then they’d get on 65 (And. Go. Nowhere). On the way one of us (not me, for prosperity’s sake) slipped on the sidewalk, in front of two guys trying to push a car up hill that was steadily, and the speedily, going backwards attempting to run them over. (I can only assume that the car was Christine stuck in the snow and had run out of options.) When he hit the ground he yelled, “PIMP DOWN!”, which he was in his right to say and was pretty funny. It took the better part of 10 minutes to pick him back up.



Hour 2: As we continued on our trek to Mordor… er BBVA, it got increasingly cold and the population begin to thin. Abandoned cards appeared everywhere, some missing tires (I’m still not sure if that happened before the storm so take that with a grain of salt). We finally met the intersection where we bid farewell to our fallen pimp… he lived down hill so I assume history would repeat itself. The remaining members, myself and the equally aged man like me (I’m guessing 35) made it to the corner of the office where my wife worked. I big him farewell. It was the last I saw of him…. until like a week later after everything had thawed. Anyways, I enter the building of BBVA, which is like Fort Knox, I mean I guess that’s guarded, but they were trying to keep non employees out even though it was a loan origination center and they don’t have money and then why… anyways, sorry. I enter the building, find my wife, embrace and say, “You’re cars here, we can still get out of here.” At which points she said, “Well… yeah but everyone is gonna sleep here tonight so they’re going over to Sabor Latino, they got great food and are feeding people.” I thought, free meal, awesome. It wasn’t, which makes total sense….



Hour 4: After dinner I decide that’s enough, we’re leaving, I don’t care. We have 3 dogs at home, I’m not leaving them all night when we are a measly 3.7 miles from home (Alford Ave). So, with my wisdom being questioned at every turn, we get into out 2008 Scion xD and make for the interstate………..



Hour 10: So, the on ramp from Lakeshore to I-65 is completely knackered. We’ve been listening to Coast to Coast with Art Bell for hours. Honestly, I was starting to believe Ancient Aliens did exist and brought this plague upon us for not investing in snow tires regardless of the norms. A cop comes to our window handing out water some type of substance that would leave a mouse looking back at you saying, “Right Gov’nah, how bout you spit on it too for some protein). Not important: But the mouse was a jerk and we didn’t know he was with us until that point. It was cool, he was just heading up to the Chevron by our house and he really hated Art Bell.  
  


Hour 12: I realize traffic, while slowly moving, has pretty much stopped. People have given up, or just pulled to the side. I look ahead and what do I see (the mouse interrupted to say the same thing but I threw a candy corn at him and he disappeared out of sight), there was opening up South I-65 from Lakeshore to the top of the mountain to the Alford exit. I turned to my wife, who had fell asleep hours ago obviously, and asked, “Should we try?”. I took shallow breathing as a yes and went for it. Little did I know that out 2008 Scion xD was FRONT WHEEL DRIVE! That little ne'er-do-well started climbing that hill. I felt like I was playing RC Pro Am (sorry kids, um maybe Forza but like a 1/50th the speed). I realized this car was PULLING me up the hill. I was passing all these losers… er neighbors, bless their souls, as I was on my home. It was on…. home we were bound.  
  


Hour 13: We made it all the way to Alford Ave and dropped the mouse of at the Chevron (who was promptly eaten by the Chevron alley cat. That’s life!). We entered our driveway somewhere around the 3am mark, stormed in the door (well I did, I forgot my wife was still asleep) and we were home!  
  
Long story short, sorta... I guess the moral is this: You can actually leave three dogs in a house from 7am to 3am the next day and they hold it…. I didn’t really expect that. They will forever be in my memory for that.



Side note: When you’re finally home in that situation, warm and in bed, don’t forget your wife that was still in the car....That was almost 12 years of marriage down the drain. What?!? She always said, “Do NOT wake me up if I fall asleep. LET ME BE!”... she never saw the end of Breaking Bad...but...I guess there are extenuating circumstances  
  


Side Authors note: This is all real except I did wake my wife up when we got home and realized that sleeping in the car off Lakeshore may have been a better option….

1qq4pam,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychesystems/comments/1qq4pam/the_psychology_of_human_behavior_8_researchbacked/,The Psychology of Human Behavior: 8 Research-Backed Tricks That ACTUALLY Work,"Most ""psychology hacks"" you see online are recycled garbage from 2015 Buzzfeed articles. I
spent way too much time digging through actual research papers, books, and legit psychology
podcasts because I was tired of the same tired advice.
Here's what I found that genuinely works. No fluff, just stuff that'll make you more likable,
persuasive, and honestly just better at navigating human interaction.


**1. The Benjamin Franklin Effect (yes it's real and kinda wild)**
Want someone to like you? Ask them for a small favor. Sounds backwards but it works because
of cognitive dissonance. When someone does you a favor, their brain rationalizes ""I must like
this person if I'm helping them.""
Research from 1969 study (Franklin himself used this to win over a rival) shows people who did
favors rated the person more favorably than those who received favors. The key is making it
small and specific. ""Can I borrow your pen?"" not ""can you help me move apartments.""
This is explained brilliantly in Robert Cialdini's ""Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion""
(literally THE book on persuasion, cited in thousands of papers, Cialdini is a prof at Stanford).
After reading it I started noticing these patterns everywhere. Best book on human behavior I've
ever touched.


**2. Mirroring but make it subtle**
Everyone knows about mirroring body language but most people do it like robots. The trick is to
mirror their energy and speech patterns, not just copying their crossed arms like a weirdo.
Match their speaking pace, their vocabulary level (formal vs casual), even their texting style. Dr.
Tanya Chartrand's research on the ""chameleon effect"" showed this increases likability by up to
30% and people don't even consciously notice.
I tested this during networking events and holy shit the difference is noticeable. Conversations
flow easier, people seem more engaged, they actually remember you after.


**3. The doorway reset**
Ever walk into a room and forget why? That's the ""doorway effect"" and you can weaponize it.
Your brain treats doorways as event boundaries and dumps short term memory.
If you're spiraling in negative thoughts or stuck in a mood, physically move to a different room or
go outside. The environmental change triggers a mental reset. Sounds too simple but
neuroscience backs this up (Gabriel Radvansky's research at Notre Dame).
I use this when I'm procrastinating or feeling anxious. Walk outside for 2 minutes, come back,
suddenly the task seems less overwhelming.


**4. The Zeigarnik Effect for productivity**
Your brain HATES unfinished tasks. They create mental tension that keeps nagging you. But
here's the hack: instead of trying to finish everything, intentionally stop mid-task when you're on
a roll.
Bluma Zeigarnik discovered people remember incomplete tasks 90% better than completed
ones. When you stop mid-flow, your brain keeps processing in the background and you'll be
eager to jump back in.
Stop writing mid-sentence, stop your workout one set early, pause a project when you know
exactly what's next. You'll eliminate that ""ugh I don't wanna start"" feeling because your brain is
already engaged.


**5. The 2 minute rule but actually use it**
If something takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately. Sounds obvious but most people don't
realize the psychological weight of tiny pending tasks.
David Allen covers this in ""Getting Things Done"" (productivity Bible, used by basically every
Fortune 500 exec). Each small undone task is an open loop draining mental bandwidth. Reply to
that text, wash that dish, send that email.
Started doing this religiously and the mental clarity is insane. You're not constantly remembering
47 small things throughout the day.


**6. Silence is powerful in conversations**
Most people are terrified of conversational pauses and rush to fill them. Don't. After someone
finishes talking, pause 2-3 seconds before responding.
FBI negotiation tactics (Chris Voss covers this in ""Never Split the Difference"", insanely good
read about negotiation psychology) show silence makes people elaborate and reveal more.
They perceive you as thoughtful, not just waiting to talk.
In arguments especially, silence is more effective than any comeback. People are WAY more
uncomfortable with it than you are.


**7. The Pratfall Effect**
Showing minor flaws makes you MORE likable, not less. Elliot Aronson's research found that
competent people who made small mistakes were rated as more appealing than those who
appeared perfect.
The key word is minor. Spilling coffee, admitting you're bad at math, laughing at yourself when
you mispronounce something. It signals confidence and authenticity.
But don't overdo it into self-deprecation. One small humanizing flaw in conversation is enough.


**8. Implementation intentions**
Instead of vague goals like ""I'll work out more,"" use specific if-then planning. ""If it's 7am on
Monday, then I'll go to gym before work.""
Peter Gollwitzer's research shows this increases follow-through by 300%. Your brain loves clear
triggers and predetermined actions. No decision fatigue, no negotiating with yourself.
The app Finch actually uses this framework for habit building. It's designed around behavioral
psychology principles and has you set specific implementation intentions for habits. Way more
effective than just generic reminders.
For anyone wanting to go deeper into this stuff, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that
pulls from behavioral psychology research, expert interviews, and books like the ones
mentioned here. You type in something specific like ""improve my social confidence"" or
""understand persuasion tactics,"" and it generates personalized audio content with adaptive
learning plans. The depth is customizable too, from quick 15-minute overviews to 40-minute
deep dives with real examples. It's been useful for connecting concepts from different sources
without having to hunt down every book or paper individually.
---
The thing about all these tricks is they work because they align with how our brains actually
function, not how we think they should function. We're not rational creatures, we're rationalizing
ones.

1qq4hji,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qq4hji,I found my dress! - My experience,"I'm getting married in September and I've booked and put down deposits on everything. Everything is arranged, I'm definitely a type A person, I'm doing all my own decor & planning, I'm DIYing the dessert table and wedding cake, I've made centre pieces and designed table numbers. I've loved every minute...

...except for the dress. I've been dreading it, the thought of going shopping for a dress filled me with such anxiety and nausea, despite having everything planned by September last year, I didn't step foot in my first dress shop till December. I knew the clock was ticking but my body has changed so much in the last 6 years (I lost about 60kg, got pregnant, had a baby, put on 30kg, lost that 30kg again) that squeezing me into dresses that were too small or watching as my ""girls"" get lost in a dress that fits my tum but nothing else... just absolute dread. 

I went to wed2b for my first shop to get my confidence up (because for those who don't know, they only sell off the peg and they won't put you in a dress that isn't your size). They were amazing, they were such good hype ladies but by not having clips, only certain dresses fit me like they should and whilst some of them looked lovely and they did their best, every single dress was missing something or had too much of something else but of course they don't hold every dress in every size so I made plans to visit another of their stores & in the meantime, I noticed a local bridal shop had a sale and I thought, well I'll message ahead and see if they've got anything I can try on in my size, they did! So I went in, nervously. She pulled everything from the sale rack that was in my size or could be put on/adjusted to my size and let me tell you, it was transformative! She clipped me in and helped me get the support I needed in the right places to see how the dresses could look & because of that I was liking things I'd ruled out the moment they touched my body previously. It was a little overwhelming, suddenly having choices and styles I had said ""absolutely not"" to before. 

Whilst I was trying on these dresses, she had one in the corner of the room that caught my eye, there was no way I could wear it for my wedding though, my partner wouldn't be disappointed if I wore it but he'd \*love\* for me to be in white and he's compromised on so many aspects of the wedding for me, it's something I want to make sure I can do for him. I asked if I could try it on, it wasn't in my size - nowhere near (a size 16, I'm a size 20/22) I could tell, the moment I managed to squeeze my hips into it that it was the one. God as she was lacing it up I thought there's no way. It's going to be so out of budget, why did I do this to myself? It's the wrong colour, it doesn't match the vibe of my venue or my wedding...nothing! but at least I'll know of it's something I'm looking for right? if it's the right style for me? right? 

I told her I loved it, she knew that already. She said ""Well, I can order it in ivory""

& that was it. All that anxiety and dread about a dress completely gone. No more lump in my throat every time someone asks me about what dress I want or am getting. I planned on sleeping on it but by the time I was in a cafe having a coffee I knew - it's within budget because they do alterations in house and their price for alterations on this dress is lower than I expected so the extra money I had allocated to alterations are instead going on the dress!! They can order it in ivory - perfect! & it's a corset so if I have weight fluctuations between now and then (I will) the dress will accommodate within reason! & As for the vibe? I am the vibe.

1qq4h5i,https://i.redd.it/s15f8pjsg9gg1.jpeg,MoltBot (ex Clawdbot) looks intimidating. it's not. here's the full setup in 30 minutes,"everyone's talking about clawdbot. twitter's going crazy. people posting screenshots of their bots clearing inboxes, scheduling meetings, researching companies while they sleep.

and you're sitting there wondering if you missed the window.

you didn't. here's how to set it up before the hype dies down and you forget.

# what clawdbot actually is

clawdbot is an open-source AI assistant that runs 24/7 on a server. you talk to it through whatsapp or telegram. it does actual work. clears your inbox. schedules meetings. researches companies. follows up with leads. writes content. manages your calendar.

one guy has his hooked up to github, google drive, and gmail. he tells it ""analyze my site, write a blog post, update my metadata, then draft a linkedin post."" it does all of it. by voice. while he does other things.

another guy has it check him into flights, monitor stock prices, and send alerts when something needs attention.

most AI tools answer questions. clawdbot does work.

why most people won't set this up

they think it's technical. terminal commands. servers. API keys.

sounds intimidating. feels like you need to be a developer.

you don't.

the whole setup is copy-paste. the wizard walks you through everything. if you get stuck, screenshot where you are and send it to chatgpt. ask ""i'm trying to set up clawdbot and i'm stuck here. what do i do?"" it tells you exactly what buttons to press.

that's what non-technical people do. works every time.

you're not learning to code. you're learning to manage an AI that works for you 24/7.

# the 30-minute setup

step 1: get a free server (5 min)

clawdbot needs to run somewhere 24/7. AWS free tier works.

go to [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) create account. search ""EC2"". click ""launch instance"". name it anything. select ubuntu. search ""free"" for instance type, pick the 8gb option. launch. click your instance ID. click connect twice.

you're in a terminal. looks scary. it's not.

step 2: install clawdbot (2 min)

paste this one line:

curl -fsSL [https://clawd.bot/install.sh](https://clawd.bot/install.sh) | bash wait 2 minutes. that's the only command. everything else is clicking through a wizard.

step 3: run the wizard (10 min)

wizard starts automatically. select ""quick start"". choose ""anthropic"". select ""token paste setup"".

it asks you to run a command on your local computer to get a token. open a new terminal, paste the command, copy the token back.

select ""opus 4.5"" as your model. select ""telegram bot"" as your channel.

step 4: create your telegram bot (5 min)

open telegram. search ""u/botfather"". send /newbot. name your bot. copy the token. paste into wizard.

search ""[u/useridbot](https://x.com/@useridbot)"". copy your user ID. paste into wizard.

this makes sure only you can talk to your bot.

step 5: give it an identity (5 min)

clawdbot asks you questions in telegram:

what should i call you? what should you call me? what's my purpose? what timezone are you in?

answer these. your assistant is now alive.

# your first 3 wins (next 5 minutes)

you just set up clawdbot. here's how to see it work immediately.

win 1: the inbox testtell it: ""check my last 10 emails and tell me which ones actually need a response.""

win 2: the research testtell it: ""research \[company you're curious about\] and give me a 3-bullet summary of what they do.""

win 3: the reminder testtell it: ""remind me to \[something you've been putting off\] tomorrow at 9am.""

all three take under 60 seconds. you'll have results before you finish your coffee.

now you trust it. now you start giving it real work.

the cost

$20/month claude subscription. free AWS server.

a human VA costs $500-2000/month and sleeps 8 hours. clawdbot runs 24/7 for $20.

# what to do after the quick wins

add brave search so it can search the web. go to [brave.com/search/api](https://brave.com/search/api). get a free API key. tell your bot ""set up brave search with this API key.""

connect your tools over time. github. google drive. gmail. calendar.

then give it real tasks:

* ""research \[company\] and give me a one-pager""
* ""remind me to follow up with \[name\] in 3 days""
* ""draft a linkedin post about \[topic\]""
* ""check my calendar and find time for a call tuesday""
* ""summarize this article and draft a thank you email to the author""

the skills are additive. every day it gets better.

if something breaks, tell your bot ""fix this"" and paste the error. it usually fixes itself.

# use voice

you don't have to type. use voice notes on telegram or whatsapp. talk to clawdbot while you walk, drive, do other things.

some people run multiple agents in slack. set off one task, start another. they run in parallel.

# the window

most people will screenshot this, bookmark it, and never set it up.

don't be most people.

the gap between ""has a 24/7 AI assistant"" and ""doesn't"" is about to get massive. the people setting up clawdbot today will have a head start everyone else spends months catching up on.

1qq4gor,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1qq4gor/what_to_do_when_youre_not_the_favourite/,What to do when you’re not the favourite,"Wife (36F) and I (40M) have a wonderful 2.5yo boy. He’s a joy. Fun, boisterous, curious etc. - not sure if relevant, just wanted to mention that :)

Up until about a month ago he had a dummy (pacifier) for naps and at night. On dental advice we got rid of that over the holiday break. All things considered he’s adjusted well but he’s skipping every other day nap and we’ve had to shuffle our night time routine to help him sleep.

We also took him out of daycare for a few weeks over the break.  He usually goes two days. He’s at home with me one day (he’s mostly content with me on these days) and with his mum another day and his gran/pop a day too.

Up until the break/getting rid of the dummy, he had a slight preference for his mum, but he was happy with either of us and would play, chat, nappy change etc with either of us

Since getting rid of it and going back to daycare, he’s completely off me. I’ll wake him up in the morning and be met immediately with a ‘go away dad’. He’ll ask me to leave the room when i come in. Won’t want to play with me. He clings to his mum’s legs if she’s making a coffee or tries to do any of the chores. We still take turns doing bath and putting him down, but he loses it on my nights.

We’re mostly coping. I get that it’s just a phase. I know he still loves me. I understand he’s just exerting whatever control he has in his little world and I’m trying to just lean into the support/background role.

But in the day to day, it’s fallen into him and his mum playing/hanging out/doing things/nappy changes/managing emotional swings in one room and me in the other prepping dinner / doing the dishes etc.

I’m not complaining about doing the dishes or dinner. We’ve always tried to split these things 50/50. Nor am I saying my wife has it easy and i have it hard. She’s “on” with him all the time and that is exhausting - she can’t get to the toilet with any peace

It’s that im low key worried that by me being more and more in the background it’ll ingrain the pattern more and more. We try and break that by all three hanging out and playing together, but you know what it’s like during the week when you’re all just trying to stay on top of things.

I’m guess I’m partly asking for validation that it’s just a phase and he’ll come around.

I’m also keen for any of your advice about leaning in to more of the support role to make it easy as possible on your partner. 

And finally, anything that helped bring them back around to being ok with hanging out with you.

1qq4gee,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qq4gee/how_to_be_disgustingly_smart_what_100_brilliant/,How to Be Disgustingly SMART: What 100 Brilliant Minds Taught Me (Science-Backed),"been diving deep into books, podcasts, research papers for months now. not in a flex way but in a ""holy shit why didn't anyone tell me this sooner"" way. studied everyone from Marcus Aurelius to modern neuroscientists, and honestly? the gap between what actually makes you smarter versus what we're told is wild.

most people think intelligence is fixed. you're either born smart or you're not. turns out that's complete BS backed by decades of neuroscience research on neuroplasticity. your brain is literally rewiring itself right now as you read this. the real question isn't whether you can get smarter, it's whether you're feeding your brain the right stuff or letting it rot on autopilot.

here's what actually worked after studying these brilliant minds:

**stop consuming, start connecting**

reading 50 books means nothing if you can't remember what you read last week. the smartest people don't just absorb information, they build frameworks.

Ryan Holiday talks about this in his podcast. he keeps a commonplace book where he connects ideas across different sources. when you read something interesting, write it down by hand (not typed, your brain processes handwriting differently). then force yourself to explain it to someone or write about it in your own words.

this is called elaborative rehearsal in cognitive psychology. you're not memorizing, you're understanding. huge difference.

**your environment is secretly making you dumber**

Cal Newport researched this extensively for Deep Work. every notification, every tab open, every ""quick check"" of social media is fragmenting your attention span. and once it's fragmented, it doesn't just snap back.

the smartest people are ruthless about protecting their attention. turn off literally all notifications except calls from actual humans you care about. batch check emails twice daily max. create physical distance between you and your phone when doing focused work.

sounds extreme until you realize your phone is designed by teams of psychologists specifically to be addictive. you're not weak, you're just fighting a rigged game. level the playing field.

**learn how to learn, not what to learn**

Barbara Oakley's research on learning techniques is insane. most people reread notes and highlight things. both are garbage tier study methods according to cognitive science.

what actually works: active recall (testing yourself), spaced repetition (reviewing at increasing intervals), and the Feynman technique (explaining concepts simply).

download Anki for spaced repetition. it's ugly as hell but based on solid memory science. you can memorize pretty much anything if you use it consistently. people have learned entire languages, medical degrees, you name it.

the key insight is that struggling to remember something makes the memory stronger. so when you can't recall something, that's actually when the learning happens. embrace the discomfort.

**read outside your echo chamber**

Mortimer Adler wrote How to Read a Book in 1940 and it's still the best book on actually absorbing complex ideas. insanely good read that will change how you approach any text.

he breaks down analytical reading, which is basically having a conversation with the author. you're not passively receiving information, you're actively questioning it. what's the author's main argument? what evidence do they provide? where are the gaps in their logic? do you agree?

this is how you build critical thinking. not by reading things you already agree with, but by engaging with challenging ideas and either integrating them or understanding why they're wrong.

the book feels a bit dated in language but the core principles are timeless. this is the best book on learning I've ever read, hands down.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers that turns books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio content. You type in what you want to learn, like improving critical thinking or mastering certain skills, and it generates a structured, adaptive learning plan tailored to your goals.

The depth customization is clutch. You can get a quick 10-minute summary or switch to a 40-minute deep dive with detailed examples depending on your energy level. The voice options are surprisingly addictive too, from a deep Samantha-style voice to sarcastic tones that make complex ideas easier to digest during commutes or workouts.

What stands out is the adaptive learning plan. It evolves based on how you interact with the content and what you highlight, creating a structured path that fits your unique learning style and intelligence type. Plus, it auto-captures your insights into a personal Mindspace so you don't lose those random breakthrough moments.

**your body affects your brain more than you think**

John Ratey's research on exercise and the brain is fascinating. moderate cardio literally grows your hippocampus, the part responsible for memory and learning. it increases BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor) which is like fertilizer for brain cells.

you don't need to become a gym rat. 30 minutes of walking or jogging where you're slightly out of breath, 3-4 times weekly, measurably improves cognitive function.

sleep is even more important. Matthew Walker's Why We Sleep breaks down how sleep consolidates memories and clears metabolic waste from your brain. when you pull all nighters or consistently get less than 7 hours, you're literally making yourself dumber. no amount of coffee fixes this.

**talk to yourself like you're not an idiot**

this sounds weird but self talk matters. Carol Dweck's research on growth mindset shows that people who say ""I'm not good at this yet"" perform better than those who say ""I'm just not smart enough.""

your brain believes what you tell it repeatedly. so stop calling yourself dumb, even as a joke. reframe failures as data points. ""that didn't work, what can I adjust?"" instead of ""I'm terrible at this.""

the people I studied who achieved the most weren't necessarily the most naturally gifted. they were the ones who believed they could improve and acted on that belief consistently.

**build a second brain**

Tiago Forte's Building a Second Brain system changed how I retain information. the idea is simple: your brain is for having ideas, not storing them.

create a digital system (Notion, Obsidian, whatever) where you capture interesting ideas, organize them by topic, and most importantly, revisit them regularly. the smartest people aren't the ones with the best memory, they're the ones with the best systems.

spend 10 minutes every Sunday reviewing your notes from the week. you'll be shocked how much you forgot already. this regular review is what moves information from short term to long term memory.

**ask better questions**

Richard Feynman was obsessed with asking why until he understood something from first principles. most people accept surface level explanations. smart people keep digging.

when you learn something new, ask: why does this work? what would happen if I changed X variable? how does this connect to what I already know? what are the implications?

curiosity isn't something you're born with, it's a skill you practice. the more you question, the more connections you make. the more connections you make, the more intelligent you become.

**stop waiting to feel motivated**

James Clear talks about this in Atomic Habits. motivation is unreliable. smart people don't wait for inspiration, they build systems that make learning automatic.

set a stupidly small goal. read 2 pages daily. watch one educational video. do 5 minutes of practice. the goal isn't the 2 pages, it's showing up consistently. once you're there, you'll usually do more. but even if you don't, you've built the habit.

intelligence isn't a trait, it's a practice. you get smarter the same way you get stronger, through consistent progressive overload. small improvements compound over time into massive changes.

the uncomfortable truth is that most people stay average not because they lack potential but because they never actually try to develop it. your brain is capable of so much more than you're currently asking of it.

these lessons aren't complicated. they're just not what we're sold. no secret hack, no shortcut. just consistent deliberate practice with proven methods. but if you actually apply even half of this stuff for 6 months, you'll barely recognize your own capabilities.",2,1769680464.0,MomentumOne,2,1.0,False

It feels like a lot of extra steps, and I’m not sure it’s the most practical long-term workflow.
So I’m curious how others handle this in real life:
Do you store large amounts of zero-TDS water and add minerals per brew or per kettle?
Do you remineralize small batches every few days?
Do you use mineral packets/drops instead of DIY recipes?
Also, from a safety and storage perspective: is it fine to store demineralized (zero-TDS) water long-term as long as it’s clean and sealed?
Basically looking for workflows that are low friction but still consistent. Would love to hear what actually stuck for you after the novelty wore off.

Only thing that comes to mind is amount of rumination and anxiety that come from it but people without OCD also have anxiety when it comes to values and other stuff in their lives that they subjectively perceive as important.

I've successfully solved almost every physical compulsion that I've had through CBT and ERP but I can't solve feeling of guilt and shame. Sitting with thoughts, doesn't help, it just keeps suppressing it and minimizing it while they stay in the background as beliefs.

Any decision that I make in my life seems conditional and I take very personally in sense of guilt and shame about it. I can't even make smallest decisions in life. Saying to myself, ""maybe yes, maybe not"" is not helpful at all because guild and shame still remain which results in CPTSD.

Only thoughts that vanished were the thoughts that I rationalized through CBT and ERP that they don't actually matter. Ignoring them doesn't do that, it just feel likes I'm ignoring something important. It's like ignoring cancer which doesn't help it.

I don't allow myself to date because I feel that this is hedonism and will lower my integrity. I used to be asked out by multiple girls but I've always felt too guilty to get commit and too guilty to have relationship without commitment.

I don't allow myself to drink coffee, smoke cigars nor drink champagne while other people around me do any experience no feeling of guilt nor shame.

Please don't respond with, it's unhealthy, you shouldn't even do it. I know but that's not the point. The point is that I feel a lot of guilt and shame about certain topics and they feel like my important values that help me be the better and superior person but at the same time they seem silly when I compare myself to other people. If I do something, I feel guilty about doing it but if I don't do something, I feel guilty about losing experience of it. I even experience guilt being around people who participate in such stuff.

These kind of stuff also translate to other subjects and topics but not as much because other stuff aren't considered taboo by society, which I don't care about, my CPTSD and OCD just latch onto them.

Ignoring thoughts, making decision and going with it, none of these things help. Especially when there is so much chaos in society, half of people who indulge in them and half of people who shame and guilt trip others for them.

How can someone date without experience of guilt, how can someone drink coffee without experience of guilt and how can someone eat meat without experience of guilt?

Where does a person draw the line because morality and values are very subjective and relative concept. You can worry about values while not having OCD but also it can be part of OCD.

Just accepting yourself, doesn't seem to help because that means you just accept yourself as inferior one and if you can accept yourself no matter what, what is the point of even trying if you are good enough despite anything and nothing really matters.

I'm not looking for reassurance, I'm just looking for new perspectives because my mind is clearly stuck in tunnel vision and fixated on certain aspects.

When I date, I feel like dirty hedonist and selfish person. If I don't date, I feel like I'm losing potential and experiences which makes me worse.

If I drink coffee, I feel guilty because I feel like I'm drug addict and disappointing parents like a bad kid despite not being a kid anymore. If I don't drink coffee, I feel like I'm wasting good experience and lacking it.

I also blame myself for everything that happens to me, even if it's directly forced by environment because it will remain part of my origin story. I can't accept that some things are not my fault and is just environment. I automatically tie it to my identity, even if I get robbed, I tie it as my fault for being in this situation and now being stuck with this experience.

Said Tzimisce, dubbed Fable the Formless was also proficient in the Flesh Crafting arts of Vicissitude as they came to the party as an 8ft tall Peacock woman.

Naturally I was as eager as anyone would be to meet with a being that would likely turn them into a coffee table if given the chance, especially given the fact that most of those flesh sculptors are mainly aligned with the Sabbat, who’s shitlist I likely managed to get on this past month after my wrath fueled raid on one of the based run by their Thinblood Goons.

That said, I don’t have the option to just not go & pretend our little appointment slipped my mind. Not only would that be certain to enrage them as a breach of hospitality, but I also stand to gain as much as I’m risking. Ever since the WereRat incident back in December my Chantry has been attempting to pool resources with others across New England in an effort to try & form contingencies against the Fera as these various breeds of Shapeshifters call themselves as well as their unique spiritual gifts & rites, but to little avail. But Fable claims to have certain knowledge on the shifters that we do not, normally did be skeptical about such things, but clan Tzimisce does have a bit of a checkered history with the Werewolves, even more so than it does with my own clan so I couldn’t simply discount the possibility that Fable was telling the truth.

Whatever the case we had agreed to meet & share knowledge so I was obliged to appear if only to keep up a formality. But as the title said, Fable’s haven wasn’t what I was expecting from a Tzimisce. It was this colonial style townhouse up on the north end of Nashua over-looking the city itself, with the main entry area being decorated with hanging vine-like plants which as far as I could tell with my Auspex were not infused with Vitae.

My Coterie was greeted by one of Fable’s ghouls & escorted to a modernly furnished living area where Fable was waiting for us along side a pair of other ghouls. The ghouls themselves did not seemed to have been transformed, at least on the surface. Fable themselves had crafted their body to resemble a kind of a Centaur with the lower body of a large cat with a fur pattern starting as Spots circling the part where the upper & lower bodies meet eventually shifting to tiger like stripes.

After properly greeting each other, Fable escorted us to upstairs to a kind of study, alongside an assortment of various certain artifacts which seemed to radiate a kind of pure spiritual energy, some of which being silver weapons while others being an assortment of various kinds of tribal staffs, drums, banners, & other handmade such items, all of which seem to have received great care in the same way as a kind of religious relic or art piece.

When I asked, Fable claimed that these items were taken from Werewolves & other shapeshifters they had battled over the years. Each one supposedly had a certain spirit bound to it, with the average items being called Fetish’s & the silver weapons specifically begin called Klaives, which according to Fable are weapons created by the shapeshifters specifically to kill other breeds. From how they explained it, Klavies are often infused with an essence of a spirit specifically related to war or violence to enhance its lethality or give it a special trait like a kind of enchanted weapon from a video game like Skyrim or WoW, while normal Fetish’s are bound to any kind of spirit to grant it a unique ability or function such summoning a spirit to commune with it, exert control over a spirit’s physical manifestation, or open up a portal to the Umbra like how the WereRat did.

Naturally I was enthralled with the knowledge on display here & from what I understand this was just the tip of the ice berg, but I recalled that this was supposed to be an exchange of knowledge & so tempered my curiosity. It was then my expectations were defied yet again, instead of asking me about what kind of research me or my chantry had been performing or something of the like, Fable asked me utterly mundane questions like what I did for fun in my mortal life, if I still remembered what certain food tasted like, or what kind of fiction was most popular in the modern era.

I was more than a bit taken aback by this & asked why Fable wanted to know this kind of information. They explained that they had only recently awakened from 50 year long Torpor about a year & a half ago & had spent nearly all of their time getting their affairs in order. Which is understandable I mean even most mortals born around that time frame are still stunned about how far technology & culture has progress over the course of time, so for a kindred to just go to sleep & wake up like that must be like stepping into another world. I asked them why they didn’t simply ask the local Harpies about that & Fable said they wanted to get a wider experience than the generalized understanding that the Harpies could give, to learn what new bloods like me did before the embrace.

I figured that if this is what they really wanted I had no reason to deny their request, so we all simply chatted for the night, I talked about different types of games people play mostly video games but also things like Warhammer or this new WarGame called Turnip28, My Nosferatu partner talked about different types of makeup & about the LGBT scene, our Group’s LaSombra talked about all the different types of music & Tv she liked, & our Malkavian mostly talked about the taste of food. Over all it was a very pleasant night, I got my hands on a lot of juicy info about the shapeshifters, Fable seemed enthralled by all the wonders of the modern world, my coterie got to hang out with someone interesting & none of us got turned into chairs. From here I’m going to moderate my tasks between my study of the Sielanic Thaumaturgy path, my own Ice/Cold based Thaumaturgic research, & this form of magic the werewolves use to commune with their spirits. From what I understand it’s similar to a kind of Shamanic tradition which centers around making pacts with spirits, though since I’m more adept at Blood Sorcery it will likely take time before I’m able to properly use & describe the entire process.

I wanted to end this log with a kind of closing phrase about how we shouldn’t judge others based on our own preconceptions, but frankly every one I came up with was a bit cheesy so instead I’ll just say that this was a worthwhile use of my time.

Since leaving the church I have found things that I love, like tea, sexual freedom, and freedom of thought and so much more. Although it’s still a struggle with family. 

I don’t believe there’s any morality with alcohol and substances. I even taken an edible on occasion. 

But I still get so uncomfortable around alcohol. I’ve tried a little and I couldn’t stand it. Knowing about the health risks as well, it’s categorized as poison juice for adults in my brain. 

I don’t enjoy it when that becomes the primary activity while socializing, people start acting unpredictable, and sometimes pushy. I also feel weird about it during family gatherings. I have a hard time shaking the feeling that it shouldn’t be around children. I also feel like smoking weed/using edibles around children.

I was able to buy a tiny compact coffee machine that is technically ""5-in-1"" which means the coffee compartment has exchangeable parts. I can use coffee grounds, 3 different branded capsules, as well as coffee pods depending on which extension I insert.

I work 50–65 hours per week on the graveyard shift and handle most household responsibilities including grocery shopping, scheduling medical appointments, and taking the children shopping and to activities. My mother lives with us and often watches the children while I sleep for work. My mother is also concerned about my wife’s behavior and lack of childcare involvement.

Timeline of Events

Morning argument in front of children

On the morning of January 26, I chose to allow my stepdaughter (10) to sleep in slightly before waking her for school. My wife woke up, became angry, and began yelling at and belittling me in front of our children. She called me a “worthless piece of shit husband” and said I was a terrible parent.

Her yelling woke our youngest daughter (5), who is autistic. My wife then began yelling at my stepdaughter to hurry and get to the car. She took my stepdaughter to the bus stop. Normally I give my stepdaughter rides to school on Mondays as part of our routine.

2) Continued verbal aggression on the porch

After returning home from the bus stop, my wife immediately began yelling at me again, this time in the living room in front of our youngest daughter. I attempted to avoid conflict and walked outside to the back porch with my coffee. My wife followed me outside and continued yelling and insulting me, including calling me weak and fearful. This continued for several minutes.

3) Wife raises hand toward my face / phone falls

At a certain point I stood up and began yelling back. As I stood, my wife quickly moved her right hand toward my face. Instinctively, I swatted her hand away to protect myself. I did not realize she was holding her phone in that hand. Her phone flew out of her hand and hit the ground.

My wife then stated she was audio recording.

4) First slap

Immediately after the phone fell, my wife slapped me in the face with her right hand.

5) Second slap in front of our autistic daughter

I attempted to de-escalate and went back inside to the living room with our youngest daughter. My wife ran inside after me, yelling profanity at me in front of our daughter.

I did not hit or yell at my wife. Instead, I began barking like a dog to distract my autistic daughter from the situation (our daughter sometimes copies barking). My wife did not stop. She slapped me again with her right hand in front of our daughter.

I sustained a cut on the left side of my cheek from my wife’s ring during one of the slaps.

6) 911 call / wife flees with child

After being slapped the second time, I told my wife I was calling the police. While I was on the phone with 911, my brother entered the home after hearing yelling from the porch. My brother witnessed the second slap.

During the 911 call, my wife grabbed our daughter and fled to her car. She drove down the driveway recklessly at high speed. I reported this to the dispatcher while it was occurring. I did not chase her.

Police Response / Concerns About Officer Conduct

Approximately 40 minutes later, a sheriff arrived at my home. Before arriving, the officer contacted my wife by phone and met with her first.

I provided the officer with a detailed account of the incident. My brother also provided a witness statement confirming he observed the second slap.

The officer told me that my wife could press charges against me for “harassment” based solely on the fact that I swatted her hand away when it moved toward my face. He described my wife’s first slap as “retaliation” for that.

The officer told me I could press charges for my wife slapping me in front of our daughter, but warned that if I did so there was a likely chance DHS would take our child away. He suggested the “easiest thing” would be to get a restraining order.

I asked about my wife grabbing our child and driving recklessly. My wife told police I chased her, which is false. I was on the phone with 911 when she fled.

My wife also claimed I scratched her left hand and that this would be enough to charge me. I swatted her right hand away, not her left.

When I asked the officer why my witness statement was being disregarded, the officer looked at my brother and stated that he “didn’t see anything,” despite my brother’s statement.

Based on these interactions, I believe I was misled and that my report and witness were not taken seriously.

Aftermath

Later, my wife texted me saying she would return home if I did not “harass, berate, or endanger” her. When she returned, she told me the officer attempted to get her to press charges against me.

The next day, my wife posted on Facebook stating that I endangered her and the girls. When I confronted her, she blocked me.

Since the incident, my wife has been acting as though she is a “perfect role model mother,” but I am concerned about ongoing manipulation and the safety and emotional well-being of our children.

I've also never had any alterations with law enforcement before. She has had a couple before getting together.

This means there are three rooms, each with two people, who share a single living room, and bathroom. In one room there is Kaitlyn and I, in the middle room by the bathroom is Nova and Taylor, and in the farthest room snuggled next to Nova and Taylor is Alex and Ayaana. I had one conversation with Kaitlyn before joining the room, while Nova and Taylor already knew each other as they shared a room the previous year. Alex and Ayaana did not know each other at all. Katie, Lex, and I became great friends the previous semester, and got along quite well with Ayaana. Ayaana is very neat and tidy, but is usually out of the dorm majority of the time. I only see her in the morning before class, and coming back before going to bed.

Issue 1, Weed: The four of us started having problems with Nova and Taylor even on move in day. They had moved in a week before us, and when we arrived the place smelled horribly of weed. It was causing me some breathing problems as I have asthma, but the first few weeks of student life had me out enjoying the last of the summer anyway. I had three failed attempts at trying to organize a roommate meeting, as Nova and Taylor never responded to any of them. At the time I was unsure of where the smell was coming from, so I just wanted to tackle it as a whole. On September 5th the suite/room started to smell heavily of weed again, but they were not in their room. It was bad enough that Katie and I couldn't be in our own room, so we went to one of our friend's suites for the meantime. I contacted one of the RA's about the issue in part to have this documented, and I was unsure what to do. They checked out the room, but since they were absent, there was nothing to be done. On September 12th I came back from class and did not even get to the top stair down the hall before it became an issue. I, being the forced extrovert of the group, was contacted by the suite across the hall, adjacent to us, and below us to contact someone in charge to address the issue. The RA told me to call a number, but like last time, they were not present in the suite. It had been established at this point the smell was coming from their room. On October 1st it had the added benefit of attempting to cover the smell up with febreeze and incense. This time they were present in the room, but I was not there to witness as I was contacted by three of my adopted introverts to make the call. This is all still while I was attempting to have a suitemate meeting and text issues in our shared group chat. In addition to talking with them about this one on one. November 16th another call was reported, and another complaint from a separate room. This one finally came with a response from Taylor. ""Hey --- are you free tomorrow night to talk about the smell reports?"" I responded yes. At the agreed meet up time I am sitting in the living room with Alex, Katie, and another friend we will call William. Taylor asks if we can speak privately in the hall, and I agree. We go sit down, and I will give you the summed up version of the conversation. She stated that she had been receiving a lot of reports about her both this year, and last year, and wished to address the issue. She stated her father had cancer and uses marijuana to deal with it, as well as her old room back at home being taken over by a heavy marijuana user, so when she comes home from weekend trips, her clothes smell like that. In addition she stated Nova often brought friends over that may partake in it as well, but they were not doing it in the dorm, and she had never done it at all. I had restated my breathing issues, and that I had gone to the Hospital for respiratory issues on the 13th of that month. As well as having visited the doctor, and being sick for weeks, already six times that semester. In addition I bought an air purifier (which was not cheap), to help deal with the air in general, and the weed. I also stated that I attended high school in an extremely rural town where even the teachers openly smoked, and had friends who grew weed in their basement. That I did not in fact believe that it is residual on her clothes, or simply individuals walking into the suite. While I don't have a problem with anyone who partakes in marijuana, it is greatly affecting my health, and there are other options than smoking it. It is legal in my state, so many suggested they simply walk five minutes until they are off campus, but they are underage, so they could be arrested. I hoped her father was doing well, but the conversation didn't amount to much of anything, other than us complaining about our ex's. After that, there were not many new issues until January 28th where the bathroom and hallway smelled like weed and Alex stated that she was in one of the stalls while two people were in the shower and she heard something about a lighter. This event has not been reported as of yet. Nova and Taylor have been sent to a few different meetings, but I am unsure of what those are covering, Taylor only stated she could receive academic punishment. 

Issue 2, Men (Normally Drunk): Nova brings a lot of friends into the suite. They are all normally drunk or high, very loud, and always at three in the morning any day of the week. Alex, Katie, Ayaana, and I have all complained about this and often lose sleep to their cackling, screaming, and music. There have also been complaints from the room below us. It is the worst for Ayaana as her bed is next to the vent which is connected to their room, and there is no other spot to move it to. We have knocked on their door time and time again to please be quiet, and they go on until about 4 am. They also sleep in the living room, which is fine because it means they're safe and not doing other things, but they'll often use and ask to borrow sheets and blankets, and won't wash them afterwards, and they smell heavily of beer and smoke. The four, technically five if we add William, don't drink or smoke and don't particularly enjoy the smell or a lot that goes with it, for our own reasons. William, 19M is Katie's boyfriend, they got together last October, and he lives elsewhere in the building. He hangs out in the living room most days, cuddles with Katie, and we all work on homework together or play one of the 30 boardgames I have. Nova's boyfriend is over 24/7, and he sleeps in her bed. They often take showers together, and enjoy very loud \*bonding\* activities together when Taylor is in class. I don't know if he lives on campus, and it was fine the first few nights, but it is starting to get creepy. We have an all girls room, and we have found pee on the floor around the toilets, when Nova's friends are the only males that use our bathroom. Since you also need a key to get into the living room, Nova will leave the door open at a bunch of random times when no one else is awake so he can get in. Alex, Katie, and I have been the only ones to add anything to the living room. Alex brought an extra chair and some figures, Katie brought a Lego set, cards, dominos, and some nic nacks. I brought a TV and all the hookups, TV stand, over 30 boardgames, coffee table, rug, two chairs, a throw blanket, some pillows, futon, posters, lights, and TV dinner tables. I got the TV from my dad, but pretty much everything else I tried to thrift. It's still over $1,000 worth of stuff I've collected to make it feel welcoming. There have been issues with stealing this year, and we have had problems with an individual from floor three coming in and snooping around with or without our absence. Leaving the door open has been addressed multiple times, and I honestly just wish for him to be removed. I don't feel comfortable with him around, and Nova and Taylor do not care about our privacy or our items. 

Issue 3, The Bathroom: As stated above, there is pee found on the floor of the bathroom, in addition some of Nova and Taylor's friends don't flush the toilets, which makes the entire place smell bad. There have been underwear, socks, and bras in the bathroom. If they are hanging up to dry that is fine, but they'll just sit there for days. Alex uses our trashcan, and there is one in the bathroom for pads and bathroom things. Ayaana has her own trashcan that she takes out. We have recycling for cardboard, plastic, and cans which I take care of when it's filling up. Taylor and Nova like using the bathroom trashcan as their personal trashcan, and don't take it out. They have never cleaned the bathroom, as that task usually falls to Ayaana and I. In addition when Nova brushes her teeth she doesn't lean down, instead she spews her toothpaste all over the counter and mirror. I brought a mini shelf to store cleaning supplies. Most of my supplies are gone, stolen, not used, and the shelf is covered in laundry and their shampoo bottles. I also brought shelves for inside the shower so people wouldn't have to carry any of that. Katie and I's toothpaste has been stolen, along with my conditioner, cotton swabs, and toothpicks. We all have little drawers under the sink to store stuff in. 

Since they don't respond to texts or knocking I am emailing everyone. If they do not respond to that, the four of us have compiled videos, photos, screenshots, complaints, dates, and various other things that they have done into a document and will be forwarding that to the president of housing along with the email. I'm still working on writing the email as I don't know how I'm going to phrase things, but we all desperately want this to end. I don't know if I'm just nit picking at this point. I just want to get a full night's rest when I have school the next day. Sorry about the mess, any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.",1,1769677589.0,roommateproblems,0,1.0,False

A photo of this morning’s cup ;-)

This is the Rosa blend from the Parisian roaster Tanat. I’ve been getting very good results with it over the past few days: a rather syrupy cup, with dark chocolate notes, just the right amount of rustic character, and a nice long finish.

My setup:

VAM Arrarex 1.0

1Zpresso JX Pro

12.5 g of beans for a slightly different ratio than a classic ristretto, around 1:1.5

In the coming days, I plan to try some single-origin beans I received from the roaster MTLY (Micro Torréfaction Lyon).

1 - Shree Krishna Mysore Pak 
2 - Anand Mysore Pak

I live in the North, and I thought that whenever I wanted to try out these recommendations I'd have to order them from the website and pay for the shipping charges. But Zepto surprised me again and I found Anand Mysore Pak online.

I switched to Blinkit to check if it was available there but it wasn't. Imo Blinkit has less variety than Zepto. But I am very grateful for both of these apps, because of them I've been able to sample a variety of snacks and sweets which aren't easily available. The quick delivery is the cherry on top. I didn't think I'd be able to get Anand Sweets delivered in such a short amount of time. Life is full of surprises 🫶

I'm slowly becoming a Mysore Pak junkie, so here's the review now:

This mysore pak is soft and viscous as well, perfect melt-in-mouth texture. It also has Nutmeg and Cardamom, and you can clearly taste those flavours. But it contains added food colouring which is a con, but otherwise it is delicious ♥️😋

I’ve been reading through the lounge lately and seeing so many posts from people feeling burnt out, overwhelmed, or struggling with low Iman. I personally find that most ""aesthetic"" planners are just too much to manage when life gets busy—they add more stress than they remove.

I wanted to create something minimalist to help us stay grounded without the pressure. I’m a student and I’ve put a lot of heart into designing this bundle to be a ""low-pressure"" way to stay consistent.

**For just $2 (less than a cup of coffee), you get:**

* **30 Authentic Duas:** One carefully selected supplication for every single day of the month.
* **Arabic, English, & Transliteration:** Included for every dua, so it’s easy to recite and understand even if you're still learning.
* **The Intentional Tracker:** A clean, one-page daily layout to track your prayers, Quran progress, and intentions without the fluff.

The $2 helps support my work as a student, but more importantly, I hope it helps you find a moment of peace and *Sakinah* every day this month.

Now I’ve decided to make my own! I want to keep the cost as low as possible, the table just needs to stand and be able to take the weight of a few plates/ my laptop. The price for materials right now is 40€ which is approximately 50 USD + probably some shipping costs and I really hope that it’s easy to put together.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qq34fu,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1qq34fu/wife_has_hit_me_in_front_of_our_kids_i_feel_the/,Wife has hit me in front of our kids. I feel the cops lied to me,"My wife has been a stay-at-home mother for approximately six years. I work 50–65 hours per week on the graveyard shift and handle most household responsibilities including grocery shopping, scheduling medical appointments, and taking the children shopping and to activities. My mother lives with us and often watches the children while I sleep for work. My mother is also concerned about my wife’s behavior and lack of childcare involvement.

Location: Oregon.

Timeline of Events
1) Morning argument in front of children

On the morning of January 26, I chose to allow my stepdaughter (10) to sleep in slightly before waking her for school. My wife woke up, became angry, and began yelling at and belittling me in front of our children. She called me a “worthless piece of shit husband” and said I was a terrible parent.

Her yelling woke our youngest daughter (5), who is autistic. My wife then began yelling at my stepdaughter to hurry and get to the car. She took my stepdaughter to the bus stop. Normally I give my stepdaughter rides to school on Mondays as part of our routine.

2) Continued verbal aggression on the porch

After returning home from the bus stop, my wife immediately began yelling at me again, this time in the living room in front of our youngest daughter. I attempted to avoid conflict and walked outside to the back porch with my coffee. My wife followed me outside and continued yelling and insulting me, including calling me weak and fearful. This continued for several minutes.

3) Wife raises hand toward my face / phone falls

At a certain point I stood up and began yelling back. As I stood, my wife quickly moved her right hand toward my face. Instinctively, I swatted her hand away to protect myself. I did not realize she was holding her phone in that hand. Her phone flew out of her hand and hit the ground.

My wife then stated she was audio recording.

4) First slap

Immediately after the phone fell, my wife slapped me in the face with her right hand.

5) Second slap in front of our autistic daughter

I attempted to de-escalate and went back inside to the living room with our youngest daughter. My wife ran inside after me, yelling profanity at me in front of our daughter.

I did not hit or yell at my wife. Instead, I began barking like a dog to distract my autistic daughter from the situation (our daughter sometimes copies barking). My wife did not stop. She slapped me again with her right hand in front of our daughter.

I sustained a cut on the left side of my cheek from my wife’s ring during one of the slaps.

6) 911 call / wife flees with child

After being slapped the second time, I told my wife I was calling the police. While I was on the phone with 911, my brother entered the home after hearing yelling from the porch. My brother witnessed the second slap.

During the 911 call, my wife grabbed our daughter and fled to her car. She drove down the driveway recklessly at high speed. I reported this to the dispatcher while it was occurring. I did not chase her.

Police Response / Concerns About Officer Conduct

Approximately 40 minutes later, a sheriff arrived at my home. Before arriving, the officer contacted my wife by phone and met with her first.

I provided the officer with a detailed account of the incident. My brother also provided a witness statement confirming he observed the second slap.

The officer told me that my wife could press charges against me for “harassment” based solely on the fact that I swatted her hand away when it moved toward my face. He described my wife’s first slap as “retaliation” for that.

The officer told me I could press charges for my wife slapping me in front of our daughter, but warned that if I did so there was a likely chance DHS would take our child away. He suggested the “easiest thing” would be to get a restraining order.

I asked about my wife grabbing our child and driving recklessly. My wife told police I chased her, which is false. I was on the phone with 911 when she fled.

My wife also claimed I scratched her left hand and that this would be enough to charge me. I swatted her right hand away, not her left.

When I asked the officer why my witness statement was being disregarded, the officer looked at my brother and stated that he “didn’t see anything,” despite my brother’s statement.

Based on these interactions, I believe I was misled and that my report and witness were not taken seriously.

Aftermath

Later, my wife texted me saying she would return home if I did not “harass, berate, or endanger” her. When she returned, she told me the officer attempted to get her to press charges against me.

The next day, my wife posted on Facebook stating that I endangered her and the girls. When I confronted her, she blocked me.

Since the incident, my wife has been acting as though she is a “perfect role model mother,” but I am concerned about ongoing manipulation and the safety and emotional well-being of our children.

In the end we managed to figure out and use the bus and it came in at just over 650LKR (£1.52/$2.10) pp! This journey took almost 5.5 hours but we saw some fantastic scenery. 

I wanted to share our experience for those making this journey on their first time in Sri Lanka. I will try to keep it simple:

- We got the bus at Fort Bus Station, around 13:00. 
- We were directed by locals at the station to the #15 bus (Sri Lankan people are the best!). Buses to Dambulla apparently run frequently.
- There was a small space for maybe 5 carry on suitcases, next to the driver. (Luckily there was space for our 2 large backpacks)
- We managed to get a seat together (ou could always wait for another bus if it's full when you get there)
- They will ask where you are going and for payment during the journey, not at the door. 
- The buses are hot but get plenty of breeze with all the windows. It was not as hot and intense as we had read/feared
- They may burn incense at the start, but it will soon be blown away
- The journey took roughly 5 hours with a short break at a rest stop (about 20 mins before Dambulla)
- The bus driver will shout out major stops and they very kindly waved us tourists to disembark when we hit the centre of Dambulla
- Pickme works in Dambulla and we were able to sort a drive to our homestay in Sigiriya straight from the ""bus stop"" (seemingly random side of the road)

Couple of notices:
- Don't forget to bring water! However, street sellers will hop on and off the bus with bottled water and snacks
- The buses here move quick! The constant honking is mainly them telling other drivers to watch out as they weave in and out of traffic. This is perfectly safe, they know what they're doing. Once you get used to it, you'll appreciate the boost to ""aircon"" (breeze) that this frantic driving brings. 
- There's no such thing as a full bus! Locals will pile in quickly at each ""stop"" (more of a prolonged braking) and stand anywhere they can. If you're sat on the aisle you will have people pressed against you, just be polite and accept the experience. 
- Don't fear for your luggage, Sri Lankan people are very kind & honest. As always, keep valuables on you at all times. 
- Locals will continue to pile larger pieces of luggage onto the pile next to the driver. In the end, we had to work quick to unbury our bags so as not to hold everyone up!

I hope this helps any tourists/backpackers on the tourist trail in this beautiful country. The main thing is to enjoy the music (i'll leave that vague to enhance your experience) and remember that you've just secured a 5 hour journey for less than a cup of tea (let alone coffee) back home!

If you're local/in-the-know please feel free to criticise my experience and share tips for future travellers :)
