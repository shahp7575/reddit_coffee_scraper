1oh17vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1oh17vv/love_finance_but_dislike_the_culture_what_other/,"Love finance, but dislike the culture, what other options are there?","I am currently pursuing a finance degree from a very good business school for my undergrad, but I am beginning to realize I really dislike the business culture. Everything is about networking and coffee chats and building connections that its started to drive me mad. Not to say I'm an anti-social person but being absurdly outgoing isn't one of my strong suits. I truly have a passion for financial markets and economics but I wouldn't align myself with the definition of a finance bro, even though many of them are great people, who I have become friends with. Everything seems so consulting driven with all these different analysis methods and pitch decks. 

 I was wondering if anybody had any success stories to share with pivoting out of consulting/biz-finance with a finance degree? Are there lots of financial positions with tech still available, or did that close with the CS jobs? If I stick it through does it get any better and less network-y? Would it make sense for me to pursue a different degree, even if I love finance?

1oh17pv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1oh17pv/did_i_ruin_chances_of_getting_back_together/,did i ruin chances of getting back together?,"my ex and i dated for two years. we broke up about two weeks ago. we were doing long distance and we decided i‚Äôd move home in july (something i was super excited abt and now i see is right choice for my life). but i think he worried that if we moved home and broke up then it‚Äôd be all his fault. i don‚Äôt know but we broke up and all he said was he had doubts, was uncertain, and had a gut feeling.

we‚Äôve gone back and forth a bit these two weeks because i keep breaking no contact. when i was supposed to pick up my stuff, i wrote him a letter that said if ive got no shot of getting back together with you then please leave my stuff outside and i‚Äôll get it and understand. and he said i just don‚Äôt know what could happen tomorrow in a week or fifty years and met me outside.

this weekend something really hurtful happened to me and i reached out to him because he knows all the details of it. he was half a jerk and half nice. he encouraged me to go to my friends instead and i said i was confused how he didn‚Äôt care about me anymore and he said that wasn‚Äôt it at all. we spoke on the phone and i said ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know if i want you anymore. i think i fell a little out of love with you this weekend. i‚Äôm sorry‚Äù and al though im hurt with how he acted, i still love him. i‚Äôm not going to talk to him for a while, but have i ruined all my chances of getting back together?

for added context, im great friends with his sister and we met for coffee. she said he‚Äôs really avoidant, which i knew, and said she really doesn‚Äôt know where his heads at. i see all this stuff about avoidant and no contact but i don‚Äôt know if this ruined any small chance i could‚Äôve had.",1,1761526763.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1oh15hn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITH/comments/1oh15hn/aita_for_confronting_my_brotherinlaw_about/,AITA for confronting my brother-in-law about suspicious behavior with my crush?,"I (24M) a thing has been bothering me for over a year now which is breaking my mental health.

TL;DR: I liked a girl who was close to my brother-in-law and sister. After my sister went abroad, I noticed some suspicious stuff between the two of them. My BIL and the girl i liked lied to me. I asked my BIL about this and he denied it, and now things between us are still tense.

About a year and a half ago, I met my soon to be  brother-in-law (BIL). He worked at the same company as my sister, along with this girl let‚Äôs call her Rachel. She was really close with both of them.

Over time, she and I started hanging out going for coffee, movies, drives, that kind of stuff. At first it was just friendly, but we started getting a bit closer. We‚Äôd hold hands sometimes when we walk, she‚Äôd rest her head on my shoulder during movies, and it just felt comfortable. But we never took it further because we both knew it could get messy.

Then my sister had to go to Europe for few months, and that‚Äôs when I started feeling something was off between Rachel and my BIL. They used to talk and hang out before, but now it started to feel different.

One time, when we were watching a movie, my BIL called her during the intermission. She spoke to him for like 20 minutes straight, even after the movie started again and i called her inside multiple times. One of the day someone dropped my BIL in our house late at night. I didn‚Äôt see her car though it sounded like her car. Another time, I saw a message from him with a heart emoji in her phone accidentally. I somewhat started getting paranoid.

Then one day, my BIL was flying back from a trip. My mom and I both offered to pick him up from the airport multiple times, but he kept saying it wasn‚Äôt needed and he would book a cab. We also invited him for dinner but he said he had plans till late at night so he couldn‚Äôt join us. 

On that day, i was going to grab something to eat so i called Rachel and i asked her if she wanted to join me. She said she had to work.
So while I was driving back from my work, I saw Rachel‚Äôs car heading towards airport area. I saw her pick my BIL up. I was shocked. He clearly lied to me and my mom. Rachel also lied to me saying she is working.

That same evening, I went to a popular restaurant to grab something to eat. He came in alone, and through the window, I saw Rachel‚Äôs car suddenly pull out of the parking lot. If she was there to only drop my BIL there she wouldn‚Äôt have parked inside. I figured he must‚Äôve warned her that I was there. Rachel was clearly running when my BIL informed her at the restaurant. If she had nothing to hide why would she run and why would my BIL warn her?

So then, I decided to tell my BIL about everything that had been going on between me and Rachel how we‚Äôd been hanging out, holding hands, etc. He didn‚Äôt see happy at all about this which i found weird. Instead of giving me suggestion, he looked confused and shocked. I then specifically asked him not to mention it to her because I wanted to handle it myself especially since we had not talked anything between us. 

But that same night, Rachel confronted me about it and was clearly upset. That hurt a lot, because it meant he told her immediately even after I asked him not to. He was apparently pissed off Rachel didn‚Äôt say anything to him. This was extremely surprising. Why should it bother him that I am close with Rachel? Why was he angry? Why did he break my trust when i asked him not to say anything to her?

At that point, I was heartbroken about Rachel who also lied to me but I was more worried that my BIL might be crossing lines while my sister was away. I told a close friend (who doesn‚Äôt know them) just to get advice. She told me to wait until I had solid proof, but honestly, I couldn‚Äôt stop overthinking it. I didn‚Äôt want to say anything to my sister because she was abroad all alone handling very difficult things.

So eventually, I confronted my BIL directly. I said something like:

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt happy that you told Rachel what I said, and I saw her pick you up from the airport even though you told us not to come. It‚Äôs made me question if something inappropriate is going on which I really hope isn‚Äôt the case.‚Äù

He denied everything and just stayed quiet. After that, both he and Rachel completely stopped talking to me. They still used to hang out. He stopped visiting our house, and soon after, he and my sister moved away.

Update: My BIL and I talk sometimes now, but things are still distant. And this has been something that has been affecting my mental health. I haven‚Äôt spoken to Rachel at all since then.

I have a couple questions was hoping someone‚Äôs been though this or can give me some legal advice. For reference I live in nj so Advice has to be for NJ.

I live in a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù complex. The first year was great. Shortly after resigning the lease I realized the neighborhood was changing and I‚Äôm pretty sure they started accepting section 8. There‚Äôs people packed in cars smoking weed late at night. I don‚Äôt really care about people smoking weed, but as a girl, I don‚Äôt always feel comfortable passing a car of men in the dark. I also noticed someone in one of the buildings near me have shady cars come and go. Often they will park outside of my apartment with the lights off and wait for someone to come to the car ( obviously selling drugs). When I approached the girls at the front office about it, they said to call the police. They aren‚Äôt interested in putting cameras up in the parking lot. My two most recent issues is my upstairs neighbors adult son has been staying with her. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs his kids mom or just someone he‚Äôs dating but a couple of weeks ago they came home at 4 o‚Äôclock in the morning and we‚Äôre just sitting in her car, smoking weed being really loud and it woke me up. My boyfriend went outside and asked them to please be quiet and the girlfriend gave him a huge attitude about it and they continued to be loud for another 30 minutes. Eventually, I called the police, and police never even showed up. ( I know because then I was awake for another two hours). Then this morning I was trying to enjoy my coffee and she came back again with her kids and maybe one of his kids and they were just being kids playing outside and she was just threatening to beat her kids the whole time. Then she was threatening to beat the dog for barking at her kids( his moms dog) and then she was yelling at one of the kids that wasn‚Äôt hers saying she wa getting her own kids food and leaving that kid out. It was disruptive, super annoying and also that‚Äôs sad for a little kid to be left out which put a damper on my morning. If I lived in an $1800 apartment Maybe I would just deal but after utilities and rent it‚Äôs over $3000 a month  and I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt be dealing with this. 

When I was looking online you can break the lease but you‚Äôd have to wait to fill the apartment they can continue charging you. If I wanted to get out of this lease how could I? ",0,1761526149.0,Apartmentliving,4,0.33,False

1oh0y8h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oh0y8h,My Acne Journey! (Still going),"Hi! I‚Äôm 19 F and I have struggled with hormonal cystic acne for as long as I can remember. More specifically the worst flare up and the one I still have scars from back in February of 2024 from switching my birth control. I‚Äôve tried Accutane, birth control, spironolactone, supplements, all the creams, diets, you name it over the course of 5 years. But I found that a balance of various changes helped me achieve maybe not clear skin yet but significant progress thus far!

1. Quitting Birth Control: 

I found that taking birth control for me at least was no longer serving its purpose. I stopped taking it December 22nd of 2024 and will never go back. I did have a bad purge period a month or two after stopping but it subsided a little. My periods also started to regulate again after the 5th and 6th month in. I was on it for 6 years leading up to that point but I‚Äôm glad my body is finally getting back to regulating hormones by itself, definitely a long process though.

2. Going on Tretinoin:

My Dermatologist back in February of this year prescribed me tretinoin as a way to help treat my acne and maybe even my scaring over time. She did start me off with 0.05% because my skin is used to stronger retinols. I started very low and slow for the first couple of months. I did experience what I believe to be purging from maybe 2-3 months? But it‚Äôs hard to tell due to a number of other factors. But all and all I‚Äôm really starting to enjoy using it regularly! I use tret now every other day (Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday night!). I use a PEA sized amount on dry skin, let dry for 10-15 minutes and then apply a toner and another cream after that.

3. Winlevi:

My Dermatologist also put me on Winlevi Summer of 2024 to try to also combat the acne. I didn‚Äôt realize I was using it incorrectly for almost a year until about a month ago. First off, the general directions says use 2x daily, I was not doing that. Immediately when I started using Winlevi 2x a day my skin drastically improved! I personally like the texture of Winlevi and I use it as a moisturizer since 90% of moisturizers break me out. I will caution though, if you skip days or don‚Äôt use it for a while, you may experience Winlevi withdrawls like I did. I stopped using it for maybe 3 days and my skin was dry and breaking out in little bumps. But other than that I love it, I just make sure I‚Äôm consistent with it!

4. Repairing the barrier:

It‚Äôs not just a trend, it‚Äôs science and it works. Making sure your barrier is hydrating and maintained is important! Especially when you‚Äôre using actives or a retinol. I skin cycle between one day a Tret day and the next a repair day. I have recently been liking the Byoma Milky Toner! I use that after I cleanse and before my Winlevi and it works great!

5. Sulfur Wash:

I made the mistake of using the Sulfur wash my dermatologist gave me every single morning. That dried me out so bad, now I use it every other morning or even two mornings and I found my skin responds well to that.

6. You are what you eat. Period.

I work for a very popular coffee company where I get a lot of my coffee and sweets for free. Ever since I was little I have had a huge sweet tooth. I also have struggled with emotional eating and binge eating for a couple years now. It fluctuates but eating better has helped me probably the MOST out of everything. It was a hard adjustment, it‚Äôs not like I didn‚Äôt know how to make healthy or nutrient dense meals I was just lazy. But what I do now is I meal prep foods I know I like throughout the week. I don‚Äôt eat dairy, gluten, eggs or consume caffeine or processed sugars. However I do allow myself to drink a little caffeine and have a little sugar on Fridays and Saturday‚Äôs for mental sanity and social stuff. I don‚Äôt really drink coffee but I do love my matcha. I don‚Äôt drink/ smoke so that was never an issue for me. I find that cutting those things out throughout the week makes me crave them less and less as times goes on. But BALANCE is key. I also like drinking tea, I mix a bag of spearmint and a bag of hibiscus with a lemon slice 1-2x a day.

Finding your topical triggers:

Through process of elimination I found my skin does not like Coconut derivatives, Niacinamide and even some silicones. I use Cosmily.com to check for ingredients

Makeup:

I‚Äôve also tried keeping makeup (at least base products) as minimal as possible to prevent clogging and irritation. I LOVEE the Ciele Skin Tint at Sephora, pricey but so worth it. If you absolutely have to use concealer I also love the NARS pot concealer but I think it might not be acne friendly. I have yet to try Ciele‚Äôs concealer but it‚Äôs next on my list for sure! I don‚Äôt really use primer anymore either, I like my toner and my sunscreen because they leave my skin hydrated and a little sticky for before base application. I also use a beauty blender but I make sure to clean it EVERY time before the next use. Whenever I take off my makeup I use an unscented micealler water on a wash cloth to gently remove. I don‚Äôt double cleanse anymore, I‚Äôll just make sure to cleanse after the micealler water.

Skin care routine:

Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturdays

AM: La roche posay Hydrating Cleanser, Byoma milky toner, Winlevi, Haru Haru Wonder air fit sunscreen

PM: La roche posay Hydrating cleanser, Tretinoin, Byoma milky toner, Winlevi

Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays

**Game Title:** **Knight‚Äôs Word Tour**

**Playable Link:** [https://coffeebreakgames.ca/](https://coffeebreakgames.ca/)

**Platform:** Web / Browser

**Description:** This is a puzzle game inspired by the classic Knight‚Äôs Tour chess problem, but with a twist. You move across the board in L-shaped knight moves, selecting letters to form words that match the theme. There‚Äôs only one correct solution, since every word must fit perfectly on the grid using the same movement rules.

I designed it to be simple and intuitive, and took inspiration from Wordle‚Äôs clean interface. Each day features a new theme and a new puzzle layout, making it a challenge you can enjoy during your coffee break. Would love to hear your feedback on the game, whether it's too easy or too hard, or even just suggestions for more features.

**Free to Play Status:** 

* \[x\] Free to play
* \[ \] Demo/Key available
* \[ \] Paid (Allowed only on Tuesdays with \[TT\] in the title)

**Involvement:** Solo developer and designer. I came up with the concept, designed the puzzles, and built the game from scratch.",1,1761525802.0,playmygame,1,1.0,False

2. I buy the coffees and get it shipped to Melbourne, and split into 50g bags

|Bean cost (200g)|$34.60|
|Admin (10%)|$3.46|
|Packaging|$1.80|

I've included a 10% admin cost just to cover stationery (labels, printing, other incidentals) which will just help me cover my costs (time is basically free...).

For shipping, I'm looking at Sendle as an option which on average for a 250g bag is approx $7 for capital cities. For other areas or regional, I will probably use Aus Post flat rate packaging which is about $10.

So in total, my estimate for a 200g bag comprising of the 4 different coffees is between $47-50, shipped to your door.

And yet it was also quite different. Like M@W the shows were promoted as ‚ÄúAn Evening With‚Äù meaning no opening band and two full sets of music allowing the band to dig a bit deeper into their catalog for many shows. It was also the only tour apart from M@W to feature a non-band member for the shows - this time it was Ottawa‚Äôs Jim Bryson instead of Chris Brown and Kate Fenner. For this tour the band started the second set with 3-4 acoustic renditions of many songs, some obvious and some not as obvious. They included the songs Boots Or Hearts, Fiddler's Green, Courage, Wheat Kings, Greasy Jungle, Scared, An Inch An Hour, Titanic Terrarium, Flamenco, Ahead By A Century, Bobcaygeon, Thompson Girl, Fireworks, The Rules, My Music At Work, Lake Fever, Toronto#4, The Bear, If New Orleans Is Beat, Are We Family, Morning Moon, The Last Recluse and Coffee Girl.  
  
Similar to the M@W tour many of the songs performed from the current album saw their live debuts and final performances during the tour, never to be played live again. This tour also saw the final performances of songs such as The Completist, Emperor Penguin, Stay, Goodnight Josephine, Are We Family, The Bear, and The Dark Canuck.  
  
It‚Äôs amazing that so many of the songs on this album were never performed again live other than Morning Moon, Coffee Girl, Love Is A First, The Exact Feeling (once in 2015), and The Last Recluse and Now The Struggle Has A Name (each with only one final time on the 2016 tour). In particular the fact that The Depression Suite was never performed again is amazing considering how great a song it is. Perhaps the lack of songs from We Are The Same being performed after the tour is a testament to the band's overall negative feeling about the album, or perhaps it just didn't translate as well live for them.   
  
The song samples for 2008/2009 which I've just uploaded draw from this selection of first, last, lesser played and acoustic versions. I was lucky enough to see 4 of the 6 Massey Hall shows in Toronto which allowed me to see quite a few songs for the first and only times out of the 35 Hip shows I saw from 1991 through 2016.   
  
Of the 84 different songs performed on this tour 43 were singles and 41 were album cuts. 31 of the songs were performed less than 10% of the shows, 32 were performed between 10 and 50% of the shows and 21 were performed at 50% of the shows or more.   
  
FYI for anyone who was following the tour at the time I was the person who was posting the stats for the shows - here they are as well - [http://www.rheostaticslive.com/Files/HIPSTATS-04DEC2009-FINALwithBreakdowns.xls](http://www.rheostaticslive.com/Files/HIPSTATS-04DEC2009-FINALwithBreakdowns.xls)

IMDb Summary: With an aspiration to become a journalist, Andy, a smart but sensible young graduate, travels to New York. She starts working as an assistant to one of the city's biggest high fashion magazine editors, the cynical Miranda Priestly.

Starring Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, Stanley Tucci, and Emily Blunt. 

This film has been a favorite of mine since it came out. The story, though having obviously been embellished, is the epitome of life as an assistant with a bad boss.  

Miranda Priestly, modeled on Anna Wintour, is worse than most bosses, but maybe not the worst that has ever existed. 

I may have worked for a few of the worst, and got significantly less money than Andy aka Lauren Weisberger, the author of the book and Anna Wintour‚Äôs former assistant. 

I learned the incredibly wise advice during my time as a legal secretary to ***NEVER*** cry at your desk (or, for that matter, on a Teams call when you get the worst review of your life - wink wink.) 

Things I can now laugh at, mostly‚Ä¶

When there was no room to pump breastmilk (the bathroom did not even have a plug) and I had to do it in the office kitchen. The attorney wanted coffee every time I was in there pumping. The door locked, but the little old man (a la Montgomery Burns in *The Simpsons*) would pound on the door daily. He knew I was in there. But he needed coffee! Now! 

I quit a job after the person who I was replacing told me that the job had driven her to attempt suicide, which is why she was promoted to paralegal. 

I am 99% sure I worked at the law firm parodied in the film *Haiku Tunnel*, which is not well known at all, but had an office manager who practically left the hallway frozen after she walked through. Was it dry ice? Nope, it was just Marilyn. 

I‚Äôve worked for yellers. I‚Äôve worked for perverts. I‚Äôve worked for underminers. I‚Äôve worked for someone who asked me to marry him, though I was already quite married (and we had no funny business going on, it shocked the hell out of me.) I‚Äôve worked for people who thought I was less than the dirt on their shoe. I‚Äôve worked for scammers who were taking the law firm for a ride, for as long as they could. I‚Äôve worked for people that I can only say were absolutely evil. 

On the other hand, I have also worked with people who became my dear friends. People I talk to every day though we have not worked at the same place for 13+ years. People I count on and people I cherish. 

On the other other hand, ((wait, how many hands do we have here?)), there are a lot of people that I just tolerate. That I like some days and dislike others. I think, you know, that‚Äôs pretty much the norm. 

I am not an ‚ÄúEmily‚Äù any more, but I am still pretty low on the totem pole. I don‚Äôt have a college degree. I will never be a Miranda Priestly, nor will I ever be at the same level, career-wise, as the person that did their best to ruin me on Teams earlier this year. 

I am, however, strong, and capable. I am kind and generous. I care for my family by working hard, and hoping to be a pleasant coworker most days. I had my own version of this movie, though less glamorous and without throwing my phone in a fountain in Paris.  

Most days, I just coordinate the chaos, manage the expectations, and try to do my best. Just like a good Emily, who knows it‚Äôs only a few days until the weekend, when even us peons can ***Movie On!***",2,1761525014.0,500moviesorbust,0,1.0,False

1oh0ioz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Milk/comments/1oh0ioz/does_ice_belong_in_milk/,Does ice belong in milk?,"Ice does belong in milk. Here is some information I‚Äôve found.

According to ‚Äúhhsmedia.com‚Äù, they have these examples: 1. You already do
Haha you naysayers. The title says it all. Have you ever purchased an ice coffee from your favorite coffee shop? Then I have news for you: You already drink milk with ice cubes! Milk is a key component  in those delicious ice coffees and you sip away, not thinking anything of it. They seem to be quite popular, so surely the public is okay with suchs methods of drinking?
2. If the ice melts  you‚Äôre doing it wrong!
You people always complain. ‚ÄúEw gross, it makes my milk all watery.‚Äù But please, the milk you drink is already diluted. It surely isn‚Äôt coming straight from the cow. 2%, Skim, Whole, they have all been tampered with to make customers more happy. Furthermore, a smaller glass can solve many problems. Drinking your milk rather promptly allows it to stay at that perfect temperature and in the end you have two ice cubes to smack against your teeth!
3. It tastes better
Who likes milk that begins to heat up anyways? Warm milk is fine (though inferior to ICE cold milk) but you never see someone saying: ‚Äúgolly, I just love my 53 degree milk!‚Äù Thats weird. Milk is suppose to be cold! It is a refreshing beverage you have over a field of victory. The ice cold temperature settles on your taste buds and has a more pleasurable effect on your psyche. Have you never sipped ice cold milk after a hard day‚Äôs work and said ‚ÄúMmmm‚Ä¶ that is amazing?‚Äù
4. It leads to a more creative mind
No I don‚Äôt have a single source to back this up‚Ä¶ But it is me (chuckles to self). I have had several conversations with fellow milk-with-ice consumers and some have recommended incredible ideas to me! Have you ever thought about freezing milk, and using that as your ice cubes? Genius!
5. It‚Äôs classy.
Imagine yourself on a beach. An umbrella by your side, waves crashing around you. Your hair is blowing in the wind and the sun reflects off your sunglasses. You swosh around your sophisticated drinking glass and the sound of ice cubes clashing with one another fills your ears. You take a sip of milk and smile with your gorgeous mustache. Sexy. All because you‚Äôre drinking milk with ice! Think about the world of possibilities that could open before you!
If you do not currently drink milk with ice cubes, I recommend you give it a whirl‚Ä¶ what do you have to lose? If you really think your milk will be substantially watered down just remember it all goes to the same place anyways!


Also, I‚Äôve asked an AI assistant. They state: Short answer: yes ‚Äî ice does belong in milk. I‚Äôll prove it with physics, food-safety logic, sensory benefits, and a simple hands-on experiment you can run to verify.

1) Physical proof (thermodynamics)

Cooling milk with ice works because melting ice absorbs a lot of energy (latent heat), so a small amount of ice can rapidly lower milk temperature.

Example calculation you can verify step-by-step:

Goal: cool 200 g of milk from 20.0 ¬∞C to 4.0 ¬∞C.
	‚Ä¢	Specific heat of milk ‚âà 3.90 J/(g¬∑¬∞C).
	‚Ä¢	Temperature change ŒîT = 20.0 ‚àí 4.0 = 16.0 ¬∞C.
	‚Ä¢	Heat to remove from milk:
Q_{milk} = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T = 200\ \text{g} \times 3.90\ \frac{\text{J}}{\text{g¬∑¬∞C}} \times 16.0\ ¬∞C.
Calculate step-by-step:
3.90 √ó 16.0 = 62.4 (J/g)
200 √ó 62.4 = 12,480 J
‚áí Q_{milk} = 12{,}480\ \text{J}.

When 0 ¬∞C ice melts, it absorbs the latent heat of fusion ‚âà 334 J per gram. After melting, raising that melted water from 0 ¬∞C to 4.0 ¬∞C needs additional energy: specific heat of water ‚âà 4.18 J/(g¬∑¬∞C), so per gram that is 4.18 √ó 4.0 = 16.72 J.

Total heat absorbed per gram of ice fully melting and warming to 4.0 ¬∞C:
334 J + 16.72 J = 350.72 J/g.

So ice mass required:
m_{ice} = \dfrac{Q_{milk}}{350.72\ \text{J/g}} = \dfrac{12{,}480}{350.72}.

Compute it:
	‚Ä¢	12,480 √∑ 350.72 ‚âà 35.58 g

So ~36 grams of ice (a little over one standard ice cube) will cool 200 g of milk from 20 ¬∞C to 4 ¬∞C. That‚Äôs efficient ‚Äî a small amount of ice does the job.

2) Food-safety / microbiology argument

Bacteria in milk grow more slowly at low temperatures. Rapid cooling reduces the time milk spends in the bacterial ‚Äúdanger zone.‚Äù Using ice (especially crushed) cools milk faster than waiting for ambient cooling, reducing spoilage risk when you need chilled milk immediately.

3) Sensory / culinary argument
	‚Ä¢	Texture & mouthfeel: chilled milk feels fresher and crisper. For some drinks (iced coffee with milk, iced chocolate, milkshakes) controlled dilution from melted ice is desirable ‚Äî it softens sweetness and heaviness.
	‚Ä¢	Temperature control: ice lets you hit an exact serving temperature quickly (important for certain drinks and recipes).
	‚Ä¢	Cultural precedent: many beverages worldwide are milk + ice (iced lattes, Thai iced milk teas, horchata with milk/almond + ice, iced milk in cereals at picnics, etc.) ‚Äî practical and well-established.

4) Practicalities and rebuttals

Common objections:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúIce dilutes the flavor.‚Äù ‚Äî True if ice is plain water. Counter: use chilled milk to start, add smaller ice or crushed ice, or use milk ice cubes (freeze milk in trays) so melting doesn‚Äôt dilute flavour.
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúIt changes texture.‚Äù ‚Äî That can be a benefit (lighter mouthfeel) or problem (if you want full-fat hot texture). Choose method based on desired outcome.

5) Simple experiment you can run (no lab gear)
	1.	Pour 200 mL (‚âà200 g) room-temperature milk into two identical glasses. Measure initial temp with a kitchen thermometer (call it 20 ¬∞C).
	2.	Add one medium ice cube (‚âà30‚Äì40 g) to Glass A; leave Glass B alone.
	3.	Stir gently and record temperature of each after 1 minute, 3 minutes, 5 minutes.
	4.	Taste both at 3 minutes and note differences in temperature, mouthfeel and taste intensity.

Expected result: Glass A will be substantially colder and (if you used plain ice) slightly less intensely flavored due to dilution. If you used frozen milk cubes, flavor won‚Äôt be diluted.

Conclusion (the ‚Äúproof‚Äù)

Thermodynamics shows a small mass of ice can remove the exact amount of heat required to chill milk quickly. That rapid cooling helps food safety and gives useful sensory effects ‚Äî and you can control dilution by choosing ice type and amount. So yes: based on physics, microbiology, culinary practice, and straightforward experiment, ice does belong in milk when your goal is to chill, alter texture, or make a particular drink.

In short, ice belongs in milk. ",0,1761524816.0,Milk,8,0.5,False
1oh0i29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discussion/comments/1oh0i29/does_ice_belong_in_milk/,Does ice belong in milk?,"Ice does belong in milk. Here is some information I‚Äôve found.

According to ‚Äúhhsmedia.com‚Äù, they have these examples: 1. You already do
Haha you naysayers. The title says it all. Have you ever purchased an ice coffee from your favorite coffee shop? Then I have news for you: You already drink milk with ice cubes! Milk is a key component  in those delicious ice coffees and you sip away, not thinking anything of it. They seem to be quite popular, so surely the public is okay with suchs methods of drinking?
2. If the ice melts  you‚Äôre doing it wrong!
You people always complain. ‚ÄúEw gross, it makes my milk all watery.‚Äù But please, the milk you drink is already diluted. It surely isn‚Äôt coming straight from the cow. 2%, Skim, Whole, they have all been tampered with to make customers more happy. Furthermore, a smaller glass can solve many problems. Drinking your milk rather promptly allows it to stay at that perfect temperature and in the end you have two ice cubes to smack against your teeth!
3. It tastes better
Who likes milk that begins to heat up anyways? Warm milk is fine (though inferior to ICE cold milk) but you never see someone saying: ‚Äúgolly, I just love my 53 degree milk!‚Äù Thats weird. Milk is suppose to be cold! It is a refreshing beverage you have over a field of victory. The ice cold temperature settles on your taste buds and has a more pleasurable effect on your psyche. Have you never sipped ice cold milk after a hard day‚Äôs work and said ‚ÄúMmmm‚Ä¶ that is amazing?‚Äù
4. It leads to a more creative mind
No I don‚Äôt have a single source to back this up‚Ä¶ But it is me (chuckles to self). I have had several conversations with fellow milk-with-ice consumers and some have recommended incredible ideas to me! Have you ever thought about freezing milk, and using that as your ice cubes? Genius!
5. It‚Äôs classy.
Imagine yourself on a beach. An umbrella by your side, waves crashing around you. Your hair is blowing in the wind and the sun reflects off your sunglasses. You swosh around your sophisticated drinking glass and the sound of ice cubes clashing with one another fills your ears. You take a sip of milk and smile with your gorgeous mustache. Sexy. All because you‚Äôre drinking milk with ice! Think about the world of possibilities that could open before you!
If you do not currently drink milk with ice cubes, I recommend you give it a whirl‚Ä¶ what do you have to lose? If you really think your milk will be substantially watered down just remember it all goes to the same place anyways!


Also, I‚Äôve asked an AI assistant. They state: Short answer: yes ‚Äî ice does belong in milk. I‚Äôll prove it with physics, food-safety logic, sensory benefits, and a simple hands-on experiment you can run to verify.

1) Physical proof (thermodynamics)

Cooling milk with ice works because melting ice absorbs a lot of energy (latent heat), so a small amount of ice can rapidly lower milk temperature.

Example calculation you can verify step-by-step:

Goal: cool 200 g of milk from 20.0 ¬∞C to 4.0 ¬∞C.
	‚Ä¢	Specific heat of milk ‚âà 3.90 J/(g¬∑¬∞C).
	‚Ä¢	Temperature change ŒîT = 20.0 ‚àí 4.0 = 16.0 ¬∞C.
	‚Ä¢	Heat to remove from milk:
Q_{milk} = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T = 200\ \text{g} \times 3.90\ \frac{\text{J}}{\text{g¬∑¬∞C}} \times 16.0\ ¬∞C.
Calculate step-by-step:
3.90 √ó 16.0 = 62.4 (J/g)
200 √ó 62.4 = 12,480 J
‚áí Q_{milk} = 12{,}480\ \text{J}.

When 0 ¬∞C ice melts, it absorbs the latent heat of fusion ‚âà 334 J per gram. After melting, raising that melted water from 0 ¬∞C to 4.0 ¬∞C needs additional energy: specific heat of water ‚âà 4.18 J/(g¬∑¬∞C), so per gram that is 4.18 √ó 4.0 = 16.72 J.

Total heat absorbed per gram of ice fully melting and warming to 4.0 ¬∞C:
334 J + 16.72 J = 350.72 J/g.

So ice mass required:
m_{ice} = \dfrac{Q_{milk}}{350.72\ \text{J/g}} = \dfrac{12{,}480}{350.72}.

Compute it:
	‚Ä¢	12,480 √∑ 350.72 ‚âà 35.58 g

So ~36 grams of ice (a little over one standard ice cube) will cool 200 g of milk from 20 ¬∞C to 4 ¬∞C. That‚Äôs efficient ‚Äî a small amount of ice does the job.

2) Food-safety / microbiology argument

Bacteria in milk grow more slowly at low temperatures. Rapid cooling reduces the time milk spends in the bacterial ‚Äúdanger zone.‚Äù Using ice (especially crushed) cools milk faster than waiting for ambient cooling, reducing spoilage risk when you need chilled milk immediately.

‚Äî

Imagine this: you wake up one morning and every mirror in your world has stopped reflecting you. Not broken‚Äîjust blank. Everything else reflects fine: your coffee mug gleams, your phone screen glows, your cat‚Äôs eyes still glint in the dark. But you? Nothing.

At first, you panic. Then you start noticing something stranger. People still react to you. They nod on the street, flirt at caf√©s, interrupt you mid-sentence. The world seems to ‚Äúsee‚Äù you just fine. Only you can‚Äôt.

Here‚Äôs the experiment:
If your reflection stopped existing‚Äîbut everyone‚Äôs perception of you remained the same‚Äîhow long would it take before you started to believe their version of you more than your own?

Would you become more confident, liberated from the loop of self-correction?
Or would you start shapeshifting unconsciously to match how others treat you, unsure of who‚Äôs leading whom?

Alternative angle: this might mirror how personality, reputation, and identity evolve online. You might be the same ‚Äúyou,‚Äù yet the world sees a composite of signals, impressions, algorithms‚Äîreflections not under your control.

Money has never been an issue in any of my friendships, except one. Let‚Äôs call her Sarah.

Sarah and I met at work almost 10 years ago. She left after two years, but we stayed close. She used to always buy me coffee or pay for dinner, and would hate it if I offered to pay her back. In recent years, she‚Äôs struggled financially after changing career fields, and often mentioned how another close friend had helped her out with money multiple times. I‚Äôd always tell her she could reach out if she ever needed help.

About a year ago, she mentioned skipping meals to save money.

Wanted to do a quick write up before I left for the day so apologies for the formatting. Really appreciate the advice I got from this subreddit so wanted to get this out for anyone going to TDL soon.

I booked tickets to Disneyland the night before. I tried to add my card online, but the ‚ÄòMy Booking‚Äô was not showing up on the website.

Sunday, 10/26/2025; rain forecasted for the whole day, but it sprinkled throughout the day. Lots of people dressed up for Halloween!


8:44: Arrived to Disneyland queue, went through security and waited in queue.

9:00: Doors opened, have QR code loaded or screenshoted before you get lined up. I had Ubiqi eSIM and my data was deprioritized. I managed to get my QR code loaded somehow before entry.

9:10: Inside park, added Amex to card. I had to email verify my Amex card. The Disney band was playing as we walked in.

9:13: Booked Beauty DPA for 9:30a; started walking towards there to get on. (2,000 yen). 
Won the raffle for Mickey‚Äôs Magical Music World at 15:55. 
Booked 40th anniversary pass for Pooh‚Äôs Honey Hunt at 11:40-12:40. I set an alarm for an hour after I booked Pooh to reserve another 40th anniversary pass later. I did this subsequently for every 2 hours after I booked.

9:30: Scanned into DPA line for Beauty, standby was 100 minutes(?). Booked Baymax DPA for 9:45 after I scanned into Beauty (2,000 yen). Beauty lived up to the hype. those teacups can move

9:45: On Baymax. Baymax was really fun! I was thinking this was a kid's ride at first when I was waiting to load, but when you get on, it‚Äôs actually really fun. The cart really throws you around. People in the queue, on the ride, and ride operators were doing the dance.

10:10: Plazma Ray‚Äôs Diner for snack and drink
	-Alien mochis (400 yen): these are really good! Red bean, custard, and strawberry flavor
	-Coca Cola and Strawberry (700 yen): tastes like a drink you could get from Sonic; had a little hard sugar thing on top of it which was not that good.

Pirates had standby time of 15 mins so we rode that. Fun ride, doesnt have as strong of a smell as Orlando. Lot more modern and paced better was well

Jungle Cruise: fun, cute little ride on the water. the driver speaks Japanese but you get the idea of what's going on. this was standby of 5 minutes. 

Haunted Mansion: rode standby for this. Estimated queue was 50 mins. Good ride, very similar to the one in Orlando but more modern and they have nightmare at Christmas theme which was cool. 

12:24: Got into Pooh queue. This was a fun ride, the carts are surprisingly fast, and nice queue area reminded me of slinky dog queue. we used our 40th anniversary pass to get in

13:00: got some bread at the sweetheart cafe, we got a fish roe bread which was okay. we had a mickey meatball bread which was good. we got the mike custard bread and it was good
 the cinnamon roll was okay. if it was heated up it's probably better. We went back over to plazma rays outdoor seating to eat these to get a seat for the parade. you get a decent view from here but not up close and personal.

13:20: Ordered some food from plazma rays for lunch
 Beef in Demiglaze with fries and Fanta Melon(540 yen + 1,200 yen): this was really good
Curry Soup with Rice, Chicken, Cheese (1,200 yen): this was okay. the rice was pretty soggy and the chicken is a chicken drumstick. I'd get the demiglaze

14:51: finished splash mountain. they take your photo on this. we rode standby which was about 40 mins
 I really enjoyed this ride. the ride restraints are a bit tight
on the way out we saw meeko and got some photos. the cast member with meeko took our photos! 

15:25: got our seats at the theatre experience. no filming allowed. really good show, you can tell they put some money and effort into this.

16:40: we finished monsters inc. we booked a 40th anniversary so it was walk on for us. 

16:45: star tours. just like the one in Orlando. for some reason, this made me feel really sick afterwards. I think I got motion sickness from this.

17:54: Booked reservation at Blue Bayou for 19:10 while watching the castle projection show. This overlapped with the Halloween parade but we wanted to try this restaurant. got a coffee and a pumpkin churro ice cream from here. churro was good but the popcorn caramel they put in there was a bit stale. feet were hurting at this point so we stayed here until it was time for our restaurant reservation.

19:10: got our seats right next to the edge of the restaurant overlooking the load queue for pirates. the ride was really dead during the parade and it picked right back up after the parade ended. it's funny hearing the ride op saying yo hoo for each ride vehicle. the ambiance on the restaurant is really nice and the food was good. they only have one set meal with two option each. we got one of each item. it was good, portions were small. it was 7000 each. 

20:30?: we ended the day with the 40th anniversary pass for big thunder mountain. fun rollercoaster in the dark. you can see the park at the peak of the climb.

we wrapped up our day back towards the train station as the fireworks started. there's a gift shop on the way out towards the train.


Overall really happy with our day at the park. All the cast members were wonderful and it was great to see people dressed up. There were some really good costumes.",2,1761523617.0,TokyoDisneySea,1,1.0,False

I currently live with my family in the Bay Area, CA, but after three years (and with two cats), I really want my own space again.

I‚Äôve lived in the LA area and in Minneapolis, MN, so I‚Äôve experienced both coasts and the Midwest. I loved the fall and early winter in Minnesota, those cozy Hallmark movie vibes, but the deep winters were rough.

In an ideal world, I‚Äôd live in Santa Cruz. I love the redwoods, the ocean drives, and the calm energy there. Being close enough to drive home to visit family would be great too, but it‚Äôs just not realistic on my income right now.

So I‚Äôm looking into places in the PNW like Oregon, Washington, or even Northern California, and honestly I‚Äôm stumped. Here‚Äôs a bit about me and what I‚Äôm hoping to find:

- I‚Äôd like to make friends and have some kind of community

- I like board games, yoga, baking for people, watching TV, and being cozy

- I'm generally trying to live a healthy lifestyle

- I‚Äôd love to meet someone eventually but it‚Äôs not my main goal

- I like the outdoors but more in a ‚Äúmedium-chill hike and scenic drive‚Äù way

- I really appreciate a good cafe or bookstore to hang out or work in

- I‚Äôm not a big drinker but will have a drink socially, same with marijuana

- Ideally Asian food is available but I could live without for a year lol

- I‚Äôm all about hygge and a warm, comfortable home. I love when it rains or snows because this is the best opportunity for peak coziness. 

A few practical things:
- Budget is ideally 1400 a month for rent but less is better

- I have a car but like having walkable areas nearby

- I want somewhere that feels safe (esp as a woman) and not too isolated

- Hoping to move in the next 6 to 9 months and stay a year or so

If you live in or know of a place in the PNW that fits this kind of vibe, especially somewhere friendly and affordable with a bit of nature and good coffee shops, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts. I'm open to other places, even international.

One of the Palestinian prisoners released in the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.

CHRISTIANITY TODAY
OCTOBER 16, 2025


Zain Jaafar / Contributor / Getty
To get from her home in Bethlehem to her college and workplace in Abu Dis, east of Jerusalem, Christine Awad had to pass through the only Israeli checkpoint connecting the northern and southern parts of the West Bank. Without this barrier and the traffic it forms, the drive would take 20 minutes. With it and the increased restrictions after the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas-led militants, Awad‚Äôs commute every morning and evening until the end of her employment in June could stretch into a two-hour journey.

Every time she reached the checkpoint‚Äîone of the West Bank‚Äôs 849 checkpoints, road gates, and obstacles‚ÄîIsraeli soldiers climbed onto the bus. Sometimes they checked passenger IDs. Other times they demanded riders hand over unlocked phones and searched their contacts, messages, and photos. Sometimes they ordered commuters to get off the bus to undergo further inspection. Once a female friend of Awad‚Äôs was taken inside a booth and strip searched.

‚ÄúYou have no agency,‚Äù Awad, a Palestinian Christian, said of these interactions. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt say no. You can‚Äôt refuse.‚Äù

Awad, now a graduate student at Bethlehem University, described passing through checkpoints as both scary and normal. The daughter of a Presbyterian pastor, Awad has lived her whole life under Israeli occupation‚Äîa term used to describe Israel‚Äôs military control of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza, areas that would constitute a future Palestinian state.

The reality of the occupation colors Awad‚Äôs view of last week‚Äôs cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. Like millions in the region, she felt relief. On Monday, Hamas returned the remaining 20 living Israeli hostages, whom the terrorist organization had held captive for 738 days. Later, Israel released around 2,000 Palestinians from prison‚Äî250 convicted of terrorism and murder and the rest detained without charges during the war.

As the Israeli hostages returned home, US president Donald Trump delivered a triumphant speech in Israel‚Äôs Parliament, the Knesset, declaring the deal would usher in ‚Äúthe historic dawn of a new Middle East.‚Äù Trump then went to Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where he and Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi co-led a peace summit that more than 20 other world leaders attended. Alongside the US and Egypt, fellow mediators Qatar and T√ºrkiye signed a document backing the cease-fire agreement and committing to an ‚Äúenduring peace‚Äù in the region.

Yet Awad expressed skepticism about whether this agreement will result in lasting peace. Both the four-day truce in November 2023 and the cease-fire that began January 19, 2025, devolved into further bombing and bloodshed.

And though often overshadowed by the Gaza war, the situation in the West Bank has worsened drastically the last two years, with Human Rights Watch reporting increased movement restrictions for Palestinians, settler violence, Palestinian-home demolitions, and an uptick in settlement building. Historically Christian areas like al-Makhrour and Taybeh have been targets of settler violence and attempts to dispossess Palestinians of their land.

‚ÄúI think now justice is more the concern before peace can happen,‚Äù Awad said.

From Beit Hanina, a Palestinian neighborhood in East Jerusalem, Simon Azazian shared similar feelings. He is grateful the cease-fire will bring relief to Gazans‚Äô suffering‚Äîsome of which he has observed firsthand as assistant pastor of Alliance Church in the Holy Land, nestled within the walls of Jerusalem‚Äôs Old City.

Since October 7, 2023, church members have visited Muslim Gazan cancer patients stuck in Jerusalem and have built friendships with 100 orphans transported to Bethlehem from a Gaza-based SOS village that supported children lacking parental care.

Twice in 2024, the congregation funded street kitchens inside Gaza where hungry families could receive a hot meal. After these events, Azazian said, around 30 individuals contacted the church through its Facebook page, expressing interest in following Christ.

Though he‚Äôs glad Gazans will get some respite in the coming days, Azazian is also concerned about the cease-fire deal. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have a few years ‚Ä¶ of peace, but things will happen again, and wars will erupt because the issue isn‚Äôt solved from its roots,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd the root here is the end of the Israeli occupation. That has to happen one way or another. We must give the Palestinians justice.‚Äù

Awad‚Äôs daily life in Bethlehem illustrates some of the justice issues created by Israel‚Äôs military control of Palestinian territories. The more than 3 million residents of West Bank‚Äîincluding Awad‚Äôs family‚Äîface water scarcity as Israel diverts more water to Jerusalem and Jewish settlements than to the homes of Palestinian residents. On average, Israelis consume around 300 liters of water daily, while Palestinians consume only 73 liters, according to a 2017 Amnesty International report.

Though Palestinian ID cards are granted by the Palestinian Authority, Israel must approve them first, which sometimes results in yearslong delays. For more than 20 years, Awad‚Äôs mother, a Filipino native, had to leave the West Bank and Israel regularly to renew her visa, incurring travel expenses and the emotional burden of separation from her husband and three daughters. Awad‚Äôs parents met in the Philippines when her father studied theology there. She finally received an official ID in early 2022.

According to Azazian, the failing economy and lack of job opportunities in the West Bank have already caused 160 Christian families to leave the Bethlehem area in the last two years. He said that 400 more families have applied for visas to emigrate. These losses make life even more difficult for the believers who remain, he said, with Christians now composing less than 2 percent of the West Bank‚Äôs total population.  

Though she regularly faces discriminatory policies and movement restrictions, Awad said she doesn‚Äôt hold bitterness toward Israeli security personnel. Azazian agrees.

‚ÄúI carry no sort of hatred or animosity to any of my brothers or sisters in humanity,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd this is the message we are trying to spread today: that as people, we can live together. We can overcome the obstacles, because this is what Jesus asked us to do.‚Äù

But Azazian does not believe the Christian responsibility to love excludes the church‚Äôs prophetic role to speak out against societal injustices that prevent lasting peace in the Holy Land. On the second anniversary of the October 7 massacre, he wrote on Facebook that Israelis and Palestinians face not a single enemy but three‚Äî‚Äúthe Corrupt Palestinian Authority, the Brutal Israeli Occupation, and the Extreme Fanatic Islamic Regime led by Hamas‚Äù‚Äîthat together ‚Äústrangled any hope for justice, peace, or dignity.‚Äù He envisions the church‚Äîbelievers of all backgrounds, inside and outside the Holy Land‚Äîbridging the gap between Israel and Palestine.  

‚ÄúThe church has an important role: to raise the voice that is calling to love and to forgiveness and to better days ahead, but also to a complete change in the different regimes and this triangle of evil,‚Äù he said.

But to play a prophetic role, Azazian believes those in the Western church must act. Instead of giving Israel unilateral support, they must also get to know Palestinian Christians, love them, and advocate for them.

After two years of war, Azazian said that ‚Äúthe forgotten faithful,‚Äù as he calls Palestinian believers, feel abandoned by many of their Western brothers and sisters, who have been influenced by Christian Zionism. Followers of the theology believe they must bless Israel, which often results in uncritical support of Israeli political and military actions.

About half of US evangelicals view Jews as God‚Äôs chosen people, according to a recent report from Infinity Concepts and Grey Matter Research. This percentage has remained unchanged from 2021, although only 29 percent of respondents under the age of 35 believe Jews are God‚Äôs chosen people. Younger evangelicals are also less engaged with and less supportive of Israel, the report found.

Azazian has met Western Christians willing to listen to and stand with both peoples, as the Alliance Church in Jerusalem practices. Every Sunday, church leaders pray for both Israelis and Palestinians from the pulpit, and they advocate for equal rights and opportunities for both groups. Three years ago, Azazian sat with a group of Christian tourists from California in their hotel room. He said he won‚Äôt forget the look in their eyes that night as he told them about his identity and experience as a Palestinian Christian.

‚ÄúThey came with repentance, saying, ‚ÄòWe are sorry. We didn‚Äôt know you existed. We feel ashamed. We want to know more,‚Äô‚Äù Azazian recalled.

When Awad was young, her parents hosted groups of American Christians visiting Bethlehem. Her mom would prepare huge trays of rice and chicken to feed groups of 15 or more. After lunch, the family would answer the visitors‚Äô questions about life in Bethlehem.

After the war began, some of these same visitors commented on Awad‚Äôs father‚Äôs social media posts about the conflict and regional politics. They sent Bible verses about loving one‚Äôs enemies and being peacemakers.

It was difficult to receive these comments from Christians so far removed from the daily experiences of the occupation, Awad said. Her father replied that believers must also stand against injustice and oppression.

‚ÄúCome and sit and just drink coffee and try to understand what our life is like, what our history is like as Palestinian Christians,‚Äù Awad said. ‚ÄúTry to understand the challenges without judging or giving advice that seems so easy on paper but difficult to actually do.‚Äù

I mostly use it at work where I do a lot of event photography with the occasional headshot and sometimes I use if for videos as well. 

I only have a [50mm 1.8 lens](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/803291956-USE/canon_0570c002_ef_50mm_f_1_8_stm.html) and a [24-105mm f/4L IS USM Lens](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/803272132-USE/canon_0344b002_ef_24_105mm_f_4l_is.html) . An issue I run into ALL the time at work is low light conditions (mostly for on stage photos) and I am constantly bumpin iso with the 24-105 lens and then having to fix it later in lightroom with the denoise feature (I hate how weird it makes things look sometimes and would love to retire that button if possible).   
  
Simultaneously, I am doing more side gigs that include engagement/wedding photography (sometimes graduation and headshots as well) and product photography (particularly drinks for a coffee company that could include people posing with the drink or just the coffee by itself but staged). 

Considering this, I am looking for a lens that works on a Canon EF mount AND MOST IMPORTANTLY doesn't break the bank, and can accomplish the following:   
\- works well in low light conditions  
\- allows for a decently wider shot that doesn't distort subjects  
\- can produce good bokeh with the right settings  
\-preferably under $500 (but willing to go higher if the price is not too insane and the lens checks all other boxes).

Additionally, I am looking for another lens that:   
\- works well in low light conditions   
\-allows for a decent zoom (I would use this for taking photos of people on-stage in low light conditions and I do not want to have to be super close to the stage to take the shot)  
\-preferably under $500 (but willing to go higher if the price is not too insane and the lens checks all other boxes).

If anyone has photos to provide as an example of lenses they recommend that would be SO VERY APPRECIATED!!!! Thanks in advance :)

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24‚Äì48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During¬†**plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and¬†**red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to¬†**track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your¬†**overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq)¬†via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what‚Äôs called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes**¬†before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

A buddy of mine met his current partner through Reddit, so I figured I‚Äôd give it a shot! I've been traveling across the country (working remotely) and have been having a blast. It‚Äôs definitely had its high and lows, and I've met a bunch of different folks along the way -- but finding those lasting connections is obviously a little tough with this lifestyle. Hence why I'm here on Reddit.

Here's a bit about me:

* I'm 40, male, and work in the medical field.
* I‚Äôve been traveling full-time since last summer. I started on the east coast, made my way through the Ozarks, and now I‚Äôm slowly meandering west.
* I love cooking, especially when I can do it outside. My go-to is a cast-iron skillet breakfast hash with whatever‚Äôs on hand -- potatoes, eggs, peppers. Hot sauce is a must, let's be real, haha.
* I'm a big reader. Right now it‚Äôs a mix of Steinbeck, some travel essays, and a book on neuroscience I like to pretend I understand.
* I used to be a runner, but now I‚Äôm more of a ""slow hiker who stops for photos and snacks"" if you get what I mean.
* I grew up near the ocean. I'm not afraid to laugh at myself, like the time I accidentally locked my keys (and shoes) inside the van at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere. Hey, at least it made for a fun story, right?
* I‚Äôm pretty low-key. I'm content with campfires, podcasts, stargazing, and the occasional dive bar conversation with strangers.
* I value good communication and people who can sit comfortably in both silence and long talks.
* My playlists jump from indie folk to old soul to 90s hip-hop, depending on the mood.
* I try to practice gratitude, even on WiFi-free days.

What I'm Looking For:

* Someone grounded, kind, and emotionally intelligent.
* someone who‚Äôs curious about the world, loves learning, and doesn‚Äôt mind taking the scenic route once in a while.
* I‚Äôm drawn to folks who can find beauty in simple things like a good cup of good coffee, a quiet morning - stuff like that.
* You don‚Äôt have to be a traveler (though that‚Äôs always a bonus), just open-minded, thoughtful, and looking to connect

[Content note: mentions of suicide and graphic fire injuries.]

I took a job at the local cemetery thinking it would be easy money‚Äîmow the lawn, plant flowers, dig a few holes. But what we saw on the mausoleum cameras last week changed everything. If you ever work there‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt watch the footage.

Part 1

I started at the beginning of summer and told my parents I was taking a gap year. What I didn‚Äôt tell them was that I never planned on going back to school.
The first morning I showed up at eight sharp. The sun was already high and the air had that heavy, early-summer humidity. Vinny, the head groundskeeper, was waiting at the gate‚Äîmid-fifties, sunburned, always chewing on a cigarette like it was part of him.
He gave me a quick tour‚Äîthe rows of stones, the old chapel with cracked windows, and the three mausoleums lined up on the east side.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your weed whacker, here‚Äôs the gas,‚Äù 

he said, handing them off like a tired teacher. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back around four to show you how to lock up the mausoleums.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds good,‚Äù 

I said, popping my earplugs in. The day passed easily enough. Cut some grass, trimmed hedges, tried not to think about being surrounded by hundreds of buried bodies.
At lunch I met the rest of the crew‚ÄîGreg and Conner.
Greg was older, maybe mid-thirties, with the look of someone who‚Äôd worked the same job too long. Conner looked about the same age as Greg, quieter, sharper around the edges.
We sat around the maintenance shed, eating sandwiches and drinking warm Gatorade, when Greg leaned over and said, 

‚ÄúDid Vinny tell you about the chapel incident?‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúNope.‚Äù

‚ÄúSome kids broke in few years back. Smashed up statues, took a crap on the floor. That‚Äôs why they installed the security system.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, really? Who does that?‚Äù

Conner snorted. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be surprised. Halloween‚Äôs the worst. People sneak in with Ouija boards, try to sleep in the mausoleums if someone forgets to lock ‚Äôem. Sometimes homeless guys camp in the back. Cops show up every few weeks chasing off kids smoking pot.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople are weird,‚Äù I said.

Greg nodded. ‚ÄúYeah, well, not much else to do in a dying town.‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt wrong. The mall was dead. The theater closed years ago. The only places still open were the diner, the gas station, and this cemetery.
After lunch, Greg and I smoked a quick joint behind the shed before finishing up. Around 3:30, Vinny pulled up in his cart.

‚ÄúCome on, kid. Let‚Äôs go lock up.‚Äù

We rode across the gravel to the first mausoleum. Vinny showed me the routine‚Äîfirst door, middle door, punch the code, then lock the last one from the outside. Same for all three and the chapel.

‚ÄúMake sense?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, easy enough.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. I‚Äôll leave the keys in my office. You‚Äôll unlock in the morning and lock up at the end of shift. Not before four. Got it?‚Äù

‚ÄúGot it.‚Äù

Not a bad job. Quiet, steady, peaceful even.
At least for the first few weeks.
Then things got strange.

It started two weeks ago on a rainy Tuesday. We couldn‚Äôt mow, so Vinny told us to clean the mausoleums. Greg and Conner went to Mausoleum A. I went with Vinny into B‚Äîvacuuming, dusting, straightening flowers.

‚ÄúKid,‚Äù 

Vinny said, wiping down a table,
 
‚Äúpull all the fake flowers from the crypts. New ones are coming in tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably should‚Äôve done that a month ago,‚Äù I joked.

He didn‚Äôt answer. Just kept wiping.
I walked down one of the aisles, passing rows of marble crypts. The air was cool and still, faintly sweet with old flowers and cleaning solution.
Then I heard it.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Soft, deliberate, from behind one of the crypt walls.
I stopped. It came again‚Äîslow, steady.
I stepped closer and read the name on the plaque: Leonardo Napolitano.
Tap. Tap. Tap.
My chest tightened. Maybe water dripping. A mouse. Pipes.
Then‚Äî

TAP. TAP. TAP.

Louder. Rhythmic.
A cold wave ran through me. The air felt heavier, like the temperature dropped ten degrees.

‚ÄúKid!‚Äù

 Vinny‚Äôs voice echoed down the corridor. 

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing? I told you to pull flowers, not stand there like a statue!‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù My voice was shaky.

‚ÄúHear what?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe tapping. From behind this one.‚Äù 

I pointed at the Napolitano crypt.
Vinny frowned, pressed his ear against the marble for a few seconds, then stepped back. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hear anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúVinny, I‚Äôm telling you‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably mice,‚Äù he said, waving me off. ‚ÄúOr water behind the wall. Either way, get back to work. We got a funeral tomorrow.‚Äù

I wanted to argue but didn‚Äôt.
I told Greg and Conner later at the shed. They exchanged a look‚Äîoh, here we go.
Greg leaned forward. ‚ÄúYou believe in ghosts, kid?‚Äù
I shook my head. ‚ÄúNo. I don‚Äôt know what it was, but it wasn‚Äôt that.‚Äù
Conner smirked. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one saying you heard tapping from behind a crypt.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, and maybe it was just pipes.‚Äù

Greg took a drag. ‚ÄúYou ever hear about the Napolitano family?‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúNo. Should I have?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey used to run things around here,‚Äù Greg said. ‚ÄúBack when this town had ties to the syndicates upstate. Leonardo Napolitano was the head. Called him The Undertaker. Owned a funeral parlor in town. Rumor is they hid bodies‚Äîburned them, stashed ashes in caskets with false bottoms.‚Äù
I laughed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs bullshit.‚Äù

Greg smiled, slow. ‚ÄúMaybe. But the old parlor shut down decades ago. The whole family‚Äôs buried here now.‚Äù
The name stuck in my head.
I didn‚Äôt sleep great that night.

A few days later it rained again. Vinny sent us back into the mausoleums to finish cleaning. Greg and Conner took A. I went with Vinny into B.
‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù he said, rolling up his sleeves. ‚ÄúPull the fake flowers, dust the benches, check the vases. Tomorrow‚Äôs funeral‚Äôs a big one.‚Äù

‚ÄúGot it.‚Äù

I headed down the narrow hall. Light from the windows felt dimmer than it should. Every step echoed like I was walking inside a throat.
When I passed the far wall, I remembered the tapping. Leonardo Napolitano.
I slowed. The room was quiet except for the vacuum hum.
Then, faintly‚Äî

Tap.
Tap.
Tap.

Same rhythm. Same deliberate knock from behind the marble.
I froze. The air went cold again‚Äîbone-deep.
Then it stopped.
I waited. Nothing.
I started to tell myself it was pipes when Vinny shouted, ‚ÄúKid! What‚Äôre you doing just standing there?‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù

‚ÄúHear what?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe tapping. Same one as last time!‚Äù

He pressed his ear to the marble, waited, shook his head. ‚ÄúNothing. Probably mice. Or water. It ain‚Äôt ghosts.‚Äù He clapped my shoulder. ‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt stop looking at the name.
Later we were prepping a new crypt for an upcoming service. Vinny had us all together.

‚ÄúRemove the decorative screws, lift the marble plate, then we‚Äôll pull the plastic seal. Kid, once that‚Äôs done, you‚Äôre crawling in to knock out the odor plugs in the back.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre screwing with me, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúDead serious.‚Äù

Conner raised his hands. ‚ÄúNot me, man. I‚Äôm claustrophobic.‚Äù

I sighed, took the hammer and chisel, and slid in on my back. The crypt smelled like damp stone and dust. Ceiling inches from my face.
I knocked the first plug out. Hollow, weirdly wet echo. Hands shaking a little, but it came clean.
I rolled to the second.
That‚Äôs when they came out.
A black river poured from the hole‚Äîhundreds, thousands of spiders. Across my face, chest, into my sleeves, my hair, everywhere.
I screamed. Scrambled backward, cracked my head on the lip, still covered.

‚ÄúKid! Holy hell‚Äî‚Äù Vinny grabbed my arms.

‚ÄúGet them off! Get them off!‚Äù

I ran outside shaking and slapping like crazy to get them off. Conner ran for the hose and blasted me. Cold water hit like a slap, washing them off in thick clumps.

‚ÄúJesus,‚Äù Greg said under his breath. ‚ÄúWhere did they all come from?‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt stop shaking. Even after the water cleared them away, I could still feel them.
‚ÄúGo home, kid,‚Äù Vinny said. ‚ÄúShower. Change. I‚Äôll lock up tonight.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôll do it.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. I want to check something first.
That evening I went back into Mausoleum B alone. The rain had stopped, but the clouds hung low.
I found the wall where the Napolitano crypt should‚Äôve been‚Äîfive over from the supply closet, three up from the floor.
But the plaque didn‚Äôt say Napolitano.
It read: Mr. & Mrs. J. Kramaski.
I stared a long time. The letters weren‚Äôt new. Old, faded, dust settled in the grooves.
I must‚Äôve mixed up the row, I told myself.
I locked the mausoleums and went home, trying to convince myself I just needed sleep.
I wish that had been true.
Part 4: The Break-In and the Footage
Next morning I pulled in half-awake, still itching phantom spiders. Greg and Conner‚Äôs trucks were there. I figured they‚Äôd started early.
Shop was empty‚Äîstrange. They never started without coffee and complaining.
I headed toward the mausoleums and saw the three of them‚ÄîVinny, Greg, and Conner‚Äîstanding out front. Vinny‚Äôs face was the kind of red that made me think someone was about to get fired. 

‚ÄúYou forget to do something yesterday?‚Äù he barked.

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ no?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow about locking up the mausoleum?‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúExplain how someone got in last night and trashed the place! We‚Äôve got a family in mourning today and now we need a new space! Get in there and clean up the mess!‚Äù

He stormed off.
I looked at Greg and Conner. ‚ÄúI swear I locked them. All of them.‚Äù

Conner shook his head and followed Vinny. Greg stayed. ‚ÄúCome on. Let‚Äôs clean it before he explodes.‚Äù
Inside looked like a war zone. Mud streaks, overturned chairs, shattered vases. The smell hit first‚Äîthick, sour, like burnt hair and wet ashes.

‚ÄúGreg‚Ä¶ what the hell‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúYou think one person did all this? I‚Äôd say it was a group of kids.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting fired aren‚Äôt I?‚Äù
‚ÄúI mean if we don‚Äôt get right to it maybe‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer.
He ran his hand along the far wall. ‚ÄúYesterday you said you heard tapping from a crypt. The name?‚Äù
‚Äú‚Ä¶Leonardo Napolitano.‚Äù

He stoped moving as soon as I said the name. Then he went back to inspecting the crypts. 

‚ÄúNo one knows what happened to him.‚Äù Greg said. ‚ÄúStory goes he skimmed money off the top . The other families found out and killed him. Some say they burned him and dumped the ashes upstate. Others think they hid him right here, in someone else‚Äôs casket.‚Äù

‚ÄúStop screwing with me. I‚Äôm already in enough trouble.‚Äù

I turned toward the supply closet‚Äîand froze.
Five rows over. Three up.
Leonardo Napolitano.
It hadn‚Äôt been there last night.

‚ÄúGreg!‚Äù

He ran over, stopped, swore. We stared at the marble. Then, slowly, the letters faded‚Äîdissolving until it read: Mr. & Mrs. J. Kramaski.

‚ÄúYou saw that, right?‚Äù he whispered.

I didn‚Äôt answer. I ran.
We found Vinny on the far side of the cemetery, still talking to Conner.

‚ÄúWe gotta see the footage from last night!‚Äù I yelled.

‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt get back and‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúListen!‚Äù I cut him off. ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs wrong with the mausoleum. I think it‚Äôs haunted‚Äîby Napolitano!‚Äù

His face went from disbelief back to rage. ‚ÄúStop with the ghost crap! Clean it or you‚Äôre fired.‚Äù

Then Conner shouted from the shop, ‚ÄúVinny! The cops are here!‚Äù

Vinny glared at me. ‚ÄúStay out of the office.‚Äù

Greg and I looked at each other.
‚ÄúWhy are the cops here?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúProbably to check the cameras,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSee who broke in.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think the footage might show him?‚Äù
Greg went pale ‚Äúyou think Napolitano did this?‚Äù

I started for the office. He grabbed my arm. ‚ÄúMaybe don‚Äôt barge in. Let them look first.‚Äù

Back inside we swept mud and glass. The smell didn‚Äôt fade. If anything it got worse‚Äîburnt hair and plastic in the stone itself.
An hour later Vinny came in with two officers. They said nothing. One stopped at the Kramaski crypt‚Äîthe same one that had said Napolitano. They stared, whispered to Vinny, and left.
By five the place was spotless, but the air still stank.
In the shop afterward, nobody talked. Finally I asked, ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what did the cops say? About the footage?‚Äù

Conner didn‚Äôt look up from his phone. ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing? What do you mean nothing?‚Äù Greg asked.

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt see anyone,‚Äù Conner said. ‚ÄúNo kids, no break-in, nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs impossible,‚Äù I said.
He shrugged. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what they said.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, man,‚Äù Greg pushed. ‚ÄúYou were with them. You had to see something.‚Äù
Conner didn‚Äôt answer.

‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll look myself,‚Äù I said, standing.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù Vinny said from the doorway.
He looked sick. Pale, sunken eyes, clammy skin like the flu.
‚ÄúGo home, kid,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt go in that office.‚Äù

‚ÄúVinny, what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt answer. ‚ÄúGo home.‚Äù

The next day Vinny didn‚Äôt come in.
Greg took over mowing, running things like normal, but the air felt wrong. Every few minutes I caught that faint smell again‚Äîburnt hair, melted plastic. It lingered in the back of my throat.
Conner looked terrible. Pale skin, bloodshot eyes, sweat soaking through his shirt even though the morning was cool. Greg sent him home before lunch.

‚ÄúFound him just standing there,‚Äù Greg said. ‚ÄúStaring at the mausoleum.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs about the video?‚Äù I asked.
Greg sighed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know, kid. But don‚Äôt look at it. Whatever they saw‚Ä¶ it can‚Äôt be good.‚Äù

The next day Greg came in thirty minutes late. He walked into the shop pale and hollow-eyed, like he hadn‚Äôt slept.

‚ÄúVinny‚Ä¶‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúVinny took his own life last night.‚Äù
I just stared. He sat down, hands shaking, and lit a joint.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you find out?‚Äù I finally asked.
‚ÄúFather Peter called me. Told me how they found him. What was left of him, at least.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶What do you mean, what was left of him?‚Äù

‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt get into details,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt pretty. This whole thing‚Äôs insane.‚Äù
Cold dread pooled in my stomach. ‚ÄúHave you called Conner?‚Äù

Greg froze. ‚ÄúDid Conner not come in today?‚Äù
Greg looked at me wide eyed waiting for my answer.
A simple answer but enough to topple are whole world

‚ÄúNo‚Äù

He called. Voicemail. Called again. Voicemail.

‚ÄúFuck this,‚Äù he said, standing. 
‚ÄúCome on. I know where he lives. We gotta check on him.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreg, wait‚Äîcall the cops. Wellness check.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time for that. If something‚Äôs wrong, we go now.‚Äù
Before we could argue, Father Peter‚Äôs car rolled into the lot. He stepped out, calm as ever.
‚ÄúGood morning, gentlemen,‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúI know this is a terrible time. We‚Äôre understaffed. I‚Äôve moved today‚Äôs funeral to St. Steve‚Äôs. Their crew will handle things today. You two should go home and rest. It‚Äôs been a trying week.‚Äù

‚ÄúFather, have you heard from Conner? Have you called him?‚Äù Greg asked.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Father Peter said. ‚ÄúIs he not here?‚Äù
Greg looked uneasy. ‚ÄúNo, Father. He‚Äôs not.‚Äù
Father Peter smiled faintly, like it didn‚Äôt matter. 

‚ÄúAlright, Father. We‚Äôll see you tomorrow,‚Äù Greg said abruptly, and headed for his truck.
Something in my gut told me exactly where he was going. I followed him. Greg sped out of the cemetery and I was right behind him. 
In my rearview mirror I saw several large white vans pulling into the cemetery‚Äîunmarked. A man in a white hazmat-style suit stepped out and spoke to Father Peter.
I stared too long. Blew a red light. Nearly got T-boned.
By the time I caught up to Greg he was parked outside a small house at the end of a quiet street. I barely got my car in park before I heard it:
A scream.
High-pitched, agonizing. The kind of sound that rips something out of your soul.
Then came the smell.
Burnt hair. Plastic. Flesh.
We turned toward the house. Flames flickered in the front bay window, orange light spreading fast.
I called 911 as Greg sprinted to the door. By the time I caught up, the heat was already unbearable.
‚ÄúConner!‚Äù Greg shouted, bursting inside.
The living room was an inferno. Conner was on the floor, covered in flames. Greg tried to smother him, screaming his name, but it was useless. I dragged Greg out before the ceiling collapsed.
We sat on the curb watching the house burn, sirens wailing. Greg‚Äôs hands were blistered and shaking. I couldn‚Äôt look away from the fire.
When the firefighters arrived, it was too late. They pulled what was left of Conner‚Äôs body from the wreckage.
A few days later they ruled it a suicide. Said he poured gasoline on himself. Found the can right next to him.
I didn‚Äôt buy it. Neither did Greg, though he stopped talking much after that.
The next time I went to the cemetery, Greg wasn‚Äôt there.
Father Peter was.
‚ÄúI quit,‚Äù I told him. My voice sounded like it belonged to someone else.
He nodded. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably for the best, my son.‚Äù
I turned to leave, then stopped. ‚ÄúFather Peter‚Ä¶ who were the people in the vans?‚Äù
He smiled‚Äîgentle, practiced, cold. ‚ÄúThe crew from St. Steve‚Äôs,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. Everything was handled perfectly in your absence.‚Äù
Something in his face told me not to ask more. I left. I never went back.
That brings me to now.
A few minutes ago, I got a text from Greg. No message. Just a video file. The timestamp matches the night the alarms went off in the mausoleum.
I‚Äôm going to watch it. But before I do, I needed to tell my story.
Even now, as I type this‚Ä¶
I can smell burnt hair and plastic.

He explicitly said that if he was an outsider looking in, he would suggest me not speaking to him because he will only lead me on. 

So I went no contact. I didn‚Äôt talk to him. I didn‚Äôt react to any social media. I started trying to fix myself

Then at the end of last month. 2 days before my birthday, he reached out to me. He wanted to know how I was. 

I debated what to do about this. I didn‚Äôt entirely trust it and I was right not to. 

What followed was 2 weeks of him being super engaging and sweet and flirty and me stupidly thinking that maybe he wanted to reconcile. 

Then during the third week it was still ok. I asked if he wanted to get a coffee. He said we could do but wasn‚Äôt as enthusiastic as I would have liked. 

Then last week after a few messages back and forth, it seems he has decided to ignore me. He hasn‚Äôt even read my messages in over a week. 

I am not surprised but I am angry at myself for engaging and I‚Äôm angry at him for how selfish he is. 

It‚Äôs messed me up so badly. It took me months to get to a point where I was feeling a tiny bit better about myself and he‚Äôs reinserted himself in and trampled on it. ",4,1761522555.0,ExNoContact,7,1.0,False

I didn‚Äôt drive straight to the station. I went back to the hotel.

My sister opened the door before I could knock. Her face was pale, eyes sunken from another sleepless night.

‚ÄúWhere were you?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúI just needed to clear my head.‚Äù

She searched my face. ‚ÄúYou look like hell.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had worse shifts.‚Äù

She tried to smile, but it broke halfway through. ‚ÄúI keep thinking maybe she‚Äôll call‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúLike this is all some mistake.‚Äù

I forced myself to meet her eyes. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to find her. I promise.‚Äù

She nodded, but I could tell she didn‚Äôt believe me. ‚ÄúI keep replaying that morning‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúWhat I could‚Äôve done different.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll drive yourself crazy.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one to talk.‚Äù

She was right.

I stayed until she finally laid down, exhaustion winning over fear once again. I watched her breathing even out before I slipped out again.

I parked two blocks away and sat in the car with the engine off. My phone sat in my lap like a live grenade. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to call anyone. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to do anything. But I couldn‚Äôt just wait for him to call.

If he said ‚Äúthe others‚Äù then there had to be others.

I drove to the precinct, let myself in through the side entrance, and pulled every missing person report I could find that matched my niece‚Äôs age bracket. No one was watching, the desk officer was half asleep.

I sat in the dark with the blue glow of the screen washing over me.

Names, faces, addresses. Most were runaways, custody disputes, tragic but explainable.

But a few‚Ä¶ felt wrong. Clean houses. Quiet neighborhoods. Parents who described the same eerie calm.

‚ÄúNothing seemed out of place.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt looked like she‚Äôd just gone to school.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe bed was made.‚Äù

The phrase kept repeating across different reports like background noise I hadn‚Äôt noticed before. Not enough to build a case. Just enough to itch under the skin.

One detective had even written, no signs of struggle, room unusually tidy.

Unusually tidy.

I leaned back in the chair. If I said anything, if I pointed this out, it would sound like pattern chasing. Like paranoia. But I knew what I was looking at.

He wasn‚Äôt picking victims. He was picking environments.

Perfect homes. Perfect kids.

He‚Äôd been doing this for a while, quietly, carefully. Long enough that the evidence looked like coincidence.

I copied what I could onto a flash drive and pocketed it. When I left the building, the night air hit cold and sharp. The streets were empty.

For a second I thought about going back to the hotel, but the thought of seeing my sister‚Äôs face again, of having to lie, it made my stomach twist.

So I sat in the car instead, the reports flickering in my head.

The dashboard clock read 2:43 a.m. when the phone buzzed. Blocked number.

I didn‚Äôt answer at first. I just watched it light up, once, twice, three times. On the fourth, I picked up.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre working late‚Äù Mark said.

My stomach went cold. ‚ÄúHow do you know that?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou drive like someone looking for a reason not to go home.‚Äù
He paused, almost amused. ‚ÄúDid you find them? The others?‚Äù

I said nothing.

‚ÄúI figured you might‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a good officer. A practiced one. That‚Äôs what I like about you. You believe repetition makes things safe. You do something enough times, you start to think it‚Äôll protect you.‚Äù

My throat felt tight. ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo teach‚Äù he said simply. ‚ÄúPerfection begins with practice.‚Äù

The line stayed quiet for a beat. I could hear faint movement on his end, something brushing against fabric, then the soft click of a switch.

‚ÄúYou practice every day‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRoutine. Coffee. Uniform. You think that makes you strong. But repetition is just another way of hiding fear. So tonight, we will practice something new.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not playing your game.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou already are‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been playing since the day you met me. Tonight, go home. Don‚Äôt look for me. Don‚Äôt call anyone. Just keep practicing what you do best, pretending everything‚Äôs fine.‚Äù

The call ended.

I sat there, staring at my reflection in the windshield. My pulse was still hammering in my ears.

Practice. The word crawled under my skin.

The phone buzzed again at 4:17 a.m. Blocked number.

I almost didn‚Äôt answer. Part of me hoped if I ignored it, it would stop. But it didn‚Äôt.

I picked up. ‚ÄúWhere is she?‚Äù

Mark‚Äôs voice came through soft, steady. ‚ÄúYou sound tired.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me where she is.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been asking all the wrong questions‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what happens when people don‚Äôt understand the lesson.‚Äù

I rubbed a hand over my face, trying to steady my breathing. ‚ÄúWhat lesson?‚Äù

He let the silence hang long enough for me to hear how calm he was.
‚ÄúPerfection takes practice‚Äù he said finally. ‚ÄúAnd what better place to practice than where she learned what perfect looked like?‚Äù

The words just hung there between us.

For a few seconds, I didn‚Äôt move. I didn‚Äôt even understand.
She never cared about perfection, her room was always a wreck.
That was half the joke between us. I used to step over piles of clothes and tell her it looked like her closet exploded. She‚Äôd laugh and say it was creative.

But that night, when she went missing, her room had been spotless.
Too spotless.

My chest tightened.

He wasn‚Äôt talking about some memory. He was talking about now.

I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúMark‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs improving‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúYou should be proud. I think she finally understands what I‚Äôm trying to show her.‚Äù

The line clicked.

For a long time I just sat there, the phone still in my hand. The air inside the car felt heavier, like the oxygen had thinned.
I wanted to believe he was bluffing. That maybe he meant something else.
But the words kept replaying. Where she learned what perfect looked like.

Her room.

That perfect room.

He was there.

By the time I started the car, my hands were shaking so bad I nearly dropped the keys.

I was halfway to the house when the phone lit up. My sister.

‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶‚Äù

She cut me off before I could say anything. Her voice was frantic, high, trembling.
‚ÄúI just talked to her!‚Äù

I gripped the wheel tighter. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI talked to her. She called me. I swear to God she called me.‚Äù

My pulse slammed in my ears. ‚ÄúSlow down. Tell me what happened.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was whispering‚Äù she said, her words tripping over each other. ‚ÄúI could barely hear her. I kept saying her name, and then‚Ä¶ then I heard him.‚Äù

My stomach turned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was him. The man who took her.‚Äù She was crying now, breath catching between every word. ‚ÄúHe told her to say something. Like it was a game.‚Äù

I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúWhat did she say?‚Äù

There was silence on the line except for her breathing. Then she whispered,
‚ÄúShe said, ‚ÄòMommy, he wants me to tell you‚Ä¶ perfection takes pain.‚Äô‚Äù

I slammed the brakes, the car jerking sideways on the empty road.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what she said. And then she screamed. And then‚Äù her voice broke. ‚ÄúAnd the call just‚Ä¶ just ended.‚Äù

I pressed the phone tight to my ear, but there was nothing left. No sound.

‚ÄúStay in the room,‚Äù I said. My voice came out lower, steadier than I felt. ‚ÄúLock the door and don‚Äôt move. Do you understand me?‚Äù

She tried to speak, but I hung up before she could argue.

The road stretched out in front of me, black and endless.
My hands wouldn‚Äôt stop shaking, but I pressed down on the gas anyway.

Tires screeched as I pulled into the driveway.
I barely threw the car into park before I was out, gun in hand.

The front door was unlocked. I pushed it open and moved room to room. Slow, methodical, every corner cleared, every shadow checked.

The house was silent.

The only light came from the crack beneath my niece‚Äôs bedroom door. A faint, steady glow that painted a thin line across the hallway floor.

I raised my weapon and turned the handle slowly.

She was there.
Curled up on the floor beside her bed, shaking but unharmed. Her eyes found mine and she started to sob.

I holstered my gun and dropped to my knees. ‚ÄúHey, hey, it‚Äôs okay. You‚Äôre safe now. I‚Äôve got you.‚Äù

She couldn‚Äôt get the words out, just nods, gasps, and the sound of her breathing against my chest.

‚ÄúHe told me if I got up he would‚Äôve killed you!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay you don‚Äôt have to worry now!‚Äù

Silence filling the air as we embraced.

Then a noise broke the quiet.
Mechanical, familiar.

The printer.

It sat on the desk across the room, light blinking. A fresh sheet slid out, face down.

I stood up and walked over, my pulse hammering in my ears.

When I flipped the page over, my stomach turned to ice.

It was a photo of the hotel. My sister‚Äôs hotel room door.
Across it, in thick red letters:
PERFECTION TAKES PAIN.


I called the precinct on the way.
My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hold the phone steady.

‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs me,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI found my niece. She‚Äôs alive. I need units at the hotel we were staying at right now.‚Äù

They started asking questions I didn‚Äôt have answers for.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs there‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHe went after my sister. Just get there. Please.‚Äù

My niece sat in the passenger seat beside me, small and silent.
Her hands clutched her stuffed rabbit like it was part of her. She hadn‚Äôt spoken since I found her.

The drive felt endless. Every red light looked the same color as the ink on that note.
Perfection takes pain.
Over and over until the words stopped sounding human.

When I turned into the parking lot, I saw the light from our room still on. 

I parked hard and got out, my niece right behind me.
The door was cracked open.

The smell hit before I even stepped inside.
Metal. Copper. Something heavy in the air.

I told my niece to stay close. She gripped the back of my jacket.

The bed was made.
The lamp was still on.
Everything was perfect.

I cleared the corners, the bathroom, the closet.
Nothing.

Then I saw it.

On the wall above the bed. Long, careful strokes of red.
Not splattered. Not rushed.
Written with precision.

Perfection takes pain.

My chest locked up.
I said her name once.
No answer.

My niece started crying behind me, soft and uneven.
I didn‚Äôt turn around.
I couldn‚Äôt.

There wasn‚Äôt blood everywhere.
Just enough to write.
Just enough to know she hadn‚Äôt left on her own.

I stood there for a long time, staring at that word.
The edges of each letter glistened in the light.

And that‚Äôs when I realized he wasn‚Äôt teaching her.
He was teaching me.

**Rule 1 when dealing with the ANGELS: Never tell them your past. The less they know about you, the better.**

My clothes proved unsalvageable, the disgusting stench clinging to the fabric after multiple washes. All of the tainted clothing met a swift end in the incinerator. The only other female in the room that day, Jessica, got it worse. Some of the black goo O‚ÄôBryon had spit up had gotten not just in her eyes, but even her mouth.¬†

Jessica was furious‚Äîrightfully so‚Äîscreaming about contamination and demanding medical evaluation. The woman had the foulest mouth on our team; I'd heard her call the warden things that would make a sailor blush. But after a closed-door meeting with our site administrator, she mostly stopped talking about the incident altogether.

Dr. Ricketts remained at our facility for the night, monitoring O‚ÄôBryon‚Äôs vitals and giving himself little pep talks in between the paces he did around our surveillance center.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna work, it‚Äôs gonna work! You‚Äôre a genius.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt sure if he was genuinely this egotistical or if he was simply trying to convince himself.

Nevertheless, O‚ÄôBryon survived the night. He slept soundly, a far cry from his usual night terror screams or erratic tosses and turns we had become accustomed to. We had been tasked with monitoring ‚Äòthe Mad Doctor‚Äô for two weeks before the procedure.¬†

As dawn cracked overhead, my last vestiges of consciousness were beginning to wear thin, just in time for my shift to close. I waved goodbye to my team, my first time leaving the facility in three days. My site administrator was there to greet me at the first exit.

‚ÄúSofia, can you go ahead and escort Dr. Ricketts to the primary exit?‚Äù Dr. Ricketts stood tense next to him. I lazily nodded my head, daydreaming about the ecstasy of my own bed as opposed to the unceremonious excuse for a cot I dwelt on here in the prison during longer shifts.

As we walked through the corridors, Dr. Ricketts bounced up and down, his glee barely contained. ‚ÄúYou realize you just witnessed history, right?‚Äù

I smiled weakly. ‚ÄúGlad I could be a part of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe revolutionized everything, the whole way our society works. This is Nobel Prize worthy, you know. Did you ever think you‚Äôd see that Monster act like a real human?‚Äù He said with gritted teeth, making sure to emphasize ‚ÄòMonster.‚Äô

‚ÄúI honestly can‚Äôt say I thought I would.‚Äù Part of me just wanted to humor Ricketts, desperate to get to my Corolla and on the road to my daughter, Abby. But another part of me was genuinely curious about what the hell I had been a part of. The monitoring, the preparation, and the candidate selection had taken up the last two months of my life, and I still didn‚Äôt know what was happening. ‚ÄúWhat was that exactly?‚Äù I blurted out before I could stop myself.

Ricketts looked less pleased than before. ‚ÄúWell, obviously, you lack the clearance to delve deep into the subject, but what you saw last night was the first human extraction of what you would qualify as ‚Äòevil.‚Äô All of us have bad thoughts, violent thoughts, evil thoughts. But we can control it, let it simmer below its boiling point. These people,‚Äù He cleared his throat, glancing around the hallway before dropping his tone an octave, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre different than us. Maybe they're weaker, or maybe there‚Äôs just more evil in them, but they can‚Äôt control it. So we have simply eliminated it.‚Äù

I stared forward down the hallway, nodding my head slowly.

‚ÄúSounds like it might put me out of a job,‚Äù I chuckled, glancing back towards Ricketts, who still seemed unamused.¬†

We walked in silence the rest of the way, each of us checking out of the facility. I offered a simple wave to Ricketts as I started for my car. He smiled.

‚ÄúSofia, right?‚Äù I nodded as he continued. ‚ÄúMonitor O‚ÄôBryon and if nothing goes awry, as I expect it won‚Äôt, the next time we meet, is when we are shooting a spot for the news, ok?‚Äù

I gave him a thumbs-up with a smile as I saw him skip off towards his distant car.

I lived about 30 minutes away from the facility, an hour outside the city. I collapsed in my bed, waking up just in time to catch my Abby returning home from school.¬†

‚ÄúMom, my cocoon hatched!‚Äù She exclaimed. Whipping out her phone and showing off pictures of her orange butterfly.¬†

‚ÄúWow, honey, that‚Äôs amazing,‚Äù I replied, embracing Abby in a hug in one hand while scrolling through the pictures of her butterfly in the other.¬†

It was a Friday, and I had planned to take her to the amusement park for the weekend when I got the first distressing message.

*Sofia,*¬†it read,¬†*report to the facility immediately. This is a mandatory report.*¬†

I had never gotten a message like this from work before.¬†

I called up my sister, Stacy. Stacy had been taking care of Abby for the past few days while I was on one of my marathon shifts at the facility.¬†

Stacy was a saint. She agreed to take Abby, and I scooped up my disappointed daughter in a full-bear hug before telling her we were going back to Aunt Stacy‚Äôs for a little bit.¬†

She was quiet on the car ride over. Aunt Stacy‚Äôs such a common place she slept, we didn‚Äôt even need to pack a bag for her, half her wardrobe and belongings were strewn across Stacy‚Äôs guest bedroom.

‚ÄúSo they can just call you in at any time, even when you took the weekend off?‚Äù Stacy‚Äôs tone struck a chord between sympathy and annoyance.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never happened before, but I guess there‚Äôs a first for everything,‚Äù I sighed, leaning up against my sister‚Äôs front porch. I pulled out the tickets from my purse. ‚ÄúLook, these were supposed to be a surprise for the weekend, two all-day passes.‚Äù¬†

Stacy shook her head before embracing me in a hug.

‚ÄúThey better be paying you triple!‚Äù she whispered in my ear.

When I got back to the facility, the parking lot was mostly empty. I buzzed in, going through security, meeting a frantic Jessica.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not letting us leave. All of them jerks, bad guys!‚Äù Jessica cried.¬†

It‚Äôs horseshit,‚Äù Aguero concurred, Jessica shooting him a glare.¬†

I saw the administrator appear over Aguero‚Äôs shoulder, straightening to attention. ‚ÄúI know you all are disappointed with the board‚Äôs decision, but they want this project to be perfect. You five are the only ones cleared to monitor our patient, O‚ÄôBryon, so make yourselves comfortable for the next seven days.‚Äù

The administrator stopped my protest before I could even start. ‚ÄúYour families have been notified, along with extended families who have taken on the burden left by your absence,‚Äù he extended an arm towards me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll all take solace that your compensation will be much greater than usual.‚Äù He turned heel and exited the room before we could badger him with any more questions.

‚ÄúWhat an asshole,‚Äù I muttered, causing Kelly to smirk and Jessica to audibly gasp.¬†

‚ÄúWell, you heard the boss,‚Äù Sebastian replied. Sebastian had been the guard to wheel in the mangled rabbit cart. ‚ÄúSofia and I can take the first shift, if the rest of you want some shut-eye,‚Äù he looked over at me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you got some sleep at home?‚Äù I nodded meekly.

O‚ÄôBryon sat on the screen mumbling to himself. The camera quality was substantially better than our normal set-up. He was smiling, his eyes seeming to sparkle.¬†

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been doing this all day,‚Äù Sebastian mumbled. ""He seems fine to me.""

I nodded, ‚ÄúHas he interacted with any of the other inmates?‚Äù  
Sebastian shook his head, ‚ÄúNot from what I‚Äôve seen.‚Äù

We sat there for the next few hours. The inmates ate dinner and started to return to their cells. Two nameless guards were walking O‚ÄôBryon towards a personal cell that he had inhabited for the past month when the phone in front of Sebastian rang.

Sebastian answered.

‚ÄúYes---Ahh, ok sir‚Ä¶.Immediately?--Ok, I‚Äôll let them know.‚Äù He pressed a button in front of us and put the microphone to his mouth.

‚ÄúThe patient can return to his normal living quarters.‚Äù The two guards looked up to the camera and nodded, doubling back and leading O‚ÄôBryon back to his original cell. Sebastian hit the table in front of me twice to get my attention. ‚ÄúSofia, can you monitor the audio? You should be able to hear them now,‚Äù He claimed, pressing another button and handing me a pair of headphones.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre back?‚Äù a straggly voice exclaimed.¬†

‚ÄúOh, Jeremiah, it is good to see you again!‚Äù O‚ÄôBryon said cheerfully.¬†

‚ÄúGet your hands off of me! What the hell are you doing?‚Äù I was about to warn Sebastian of the incident when he finished flicking a few switches, and O‚ÄôBryon‚Äôs cell suddenly popped up on one of our monitors.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a hug, Jeremiah, I hope we can start anew.‚Äù

‚ÄúGet the fuck off me, freak!‚Äù Jeremiah shoved O‚ÄôBryon back.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Jeremiah. I should have known better.‚Äù O‚ÄôBryon replied remorsefully, plopping down on the bottom bunk.

‚ÄúTop bunk.‚Äù Jeremiah threatened. O‚ÄôBryon nodded and climbed up to the top.¬†

‚ÄúDid it lobotomize him? He‚Äôs a pushover now.‚Äù Sebastian wondered aloud, now sporting headphones of his own. I shrugged in agreement.¬†

‚ÄúWhy are you like this?‚Äù O‚ÄôBryon asked down towards Jeremiah as the two took their places in the bunk bed.¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you ask?‚Äù Jeremiah looked up, puzzled.¬†

‚ÄúWhy are you so angry all the time?‚Äù O‚ÄôBryon‚Äôs eyes looked sad.

‚ÄúThis is some sort of weird ass-test?‚Äù Jeremiah wore a look of concern, almost cowering, looking up at the former ‚ÄòMad Doctor.‚Äô

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to help, get to know the real you. Why are you here, Jeremiah?‚Äù Jeremiah looked up suspiciously.¬†

‚ÄúI was set up, they said I killed my wife, but I wasn‚Äôt anywhere near that bitch‚Äôs house.‚Äù Jeremiah turned his body and looked at the wall. ‚ÄúYou know, you‚Äôre one to ask, you know they call you the ‚ÄòMad Doctor‚Äô, don‚Äôt ya?‚Äù

O‚ÄôBryon closed his eyes and sighed. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt fix the past, but we can turn a new leaf, can‚Äôt we, Jeremiah?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt shut up, up there, I swear to god I‚Äôll fucking choke you out, old man.‚Äù

I reached for the phone, ready to warn the guards of Jeremiah‚Äôs expected violent outbursts, but Sebastian stopped me.¬†

‚ÄúRemember, Jessica had to implant the patient‚Äôs cellmate with the probes,‚Äù he motioned to another button, ‚Äúhe lays a finger on O‚ÄôBryon and we‚Äôre gonna shock him halfway to death.‚Äù

I nodded slowly. Sebastian took a lot more pride in our work than I did and took everything a lot more seriously than I had the last few weeks. The peculiar nature of the situation made me regret merely going through the motions.¬†

The two kept talking. O‚ÄôBryon would try to pry deeper into Jeremiah‚Äôs personal life while Jeremiah would shout back vague threats and insults. I felt a tap on my shoulder as Kelly took my shift.

It felt like hours before I finally drifted off to sleep. My sleeping chamber was pitch-black. I don‚Äôt know if it was still night or finally morning when I felt Jessica rousing me awake, light from the hallway pouring into my quarters.¬†

‚ÄúWas that too rough?‚Äù She worried as she grasped both of her shoulders.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù I said a little grouchy, still fighting off the last bastions of sleep.¬†

‚ÄúOh my bad. It‚Äôs your turn on shift, but if you want to catch a few more Zzzzs, I can go a little longer.‚Äù¬†

I scowled at her, confident that she was being sarcastic. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fine, alright, I‚Äôll be up in a sec.‚Äù

I marched into the control room, greeted by sunlight. Sebastian, Kelly, and Aguero all sat around the monitors sipping coffee.¬†

‚ÄúMade you a cup.‚Äù Kelly held up a styrofoam offering. I accepted it, brushing out the sleepiness from my eyes.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù I inquired, forcing a yawn to retreat, pointing towards the central screen. O‚ÄôBryon, a permanent recluse in the dining hall, seemed to be leading a gaggle of four men at a table, Jeremiah sitting next to him.¬†

‚ÄúJeremiah finally opened up to the old man. Heard he‚Äôs taken him to the Prisoner‚Äôs Prom,‚Äù Sebastian laughed.¬†

The whole day in the yard, at meals, when they were just sitting around, Jeremiah and O‚ÄôBryon seemed attached at the hip. They exchanged stories, told jokes, O‚ÄôBryon‚Äôs staying G while Jeremiah‚Äôs jokes ventured deep into R-rated territory, and expressed remorse that they hadn‚Äôt been friendlier sooner.¬†

It went on this way for two more days. Each hour watching the newly reformed O‚ÄôBryon made me more and more of a believer in the ANGEL treatment. Sure, Ricketts may have seemed a bit crazy with a serious God-complex, but here before my eyes, I saw a man, famous for disfigurement and murder, now seriously seem like he wouldn‚Äôt hurt a fly.¬†

It was around noon when the first incident happened.

O'Bryon led Jeremiah to a small patch of grass in the mostly dirt-filled prison yard.

""Are you ready for this next step?"" O'Bryon asked, our control center was able to pick up every sound and sight in the facility. Jeremiah gave a half-hearted nod before lowering to his knees.

All five of us were in the control room. Most of us had slowly lost interest in the project, counting down the days of the week until we were finally granted our freedom. Jessica had taken more of an interest in O'Bryon and Jeremiah's budding friendship and called for our attention as Jeremiah slowly got to his knees.

""I know they're both in prison and haven't seen a woman in a while, but he's not gonna-"" Kelly stopped when Jessica shot him a dirty look.

Jeremiah looked nervous. He got back to his feet and gave O'Bryon a small push back.

""I don't know about this, man. Let's just go back to normal, ok?""

O'Bryon's face fell. For a moment, he looked genuinely heartbroken, like a father watching his son reject salvation. He placed a limp hand on Jeremiah's shoulder.

""Ok, Jeremiah. It's ok.""

Then his fingers dug in.

O'Bryon's arm snapped around Jeremiah's throat with inhuman speed, the chokehold so tight I could see Jeremiah's face already darkening on the monitor. ""But there's evil in you, son. So much evil."" His voice was gentle, almost loving, even as Jeremiah's feet kicked desperately against the dirt.

""What the fuck‚Äî"" Kelly started, but the words died in his throat.

O'Bryon's free hand clamped over Jeremiah's jaw, fingers forcing their way between his lips. Jeremiah's scream came out muffled and wet as O'Bryon pried his mouth open like he was cracking a shell. I could see Jeremiah's teeth cutting into O'Bryon's fingers, blood mixing with saliva, but O'Bryon didn't even flinch.

""I'm saving you,"" O'Bryon whispered, pulling Jeremiah closer, almost tender. ""I'm saving you, son.""

Then his jaw unhinged.

The joints popped with sounds our audio picked up all too clearly. His throat convulsed, once, twice, and then it came.

The black goo erupted from O'Bryon's mouth in a thick, pulsating torrent. It forced its way into Jeremiah's mouth like it was alive, like it had purpose. Jeremiah's eyes went wide with pure animal terror, his body convulsing as the substance flooded down his throat. He tried to bite down, tried to turn his head, but O'Bryon held him fast, their mouths pressed together in an obscene mockery of intimacy.

Jeremiah's screams turned to choking gurgles. His hands clawed at O'Bryon's face, drawing blood, but O'Bryon just stroked his hair with his free hand like he was comforting a frightened child.

The black goo overflowed from the corners of Jeremiah's mouth, running down his chin, his neck, soaking into his orange jumpsuit. His throat worked frantically, forced to swallow, drowning in it.

""Jesus Christ,"" Aguero breathed beside me. ""Jesus fucking Christ.""

I couldn't move. None of us could. We just watched as Jeremiah's struggles grew weaker, his kicks becoming twitches. The black substance seemed to pulse with its own heartbeat as it transferred from one body to another, and I swore I could see it moving beneath Jeremiah's skin, spreading through his veins like ink in water.

O'Bryon finally pulled away. The disconnect made a wet, sucking sound that made my stomach lurch. Jeremiah collapsed to his knees, black ooze pouring from his mouth and nose, his whole body heaving as he vomited more of it onto the grass. His hands clutched at his throat, at his chest, fingers scrabbling like he was trying to claw the substance back out.

O'Bryon knelt beside him, gathering him into his arms. Jeremiah was crying now, animal sounds of anguish and terror, his face a mask of black slime, tears, and blood.

""I know it hurts,"" O'Bryon murmured, rocking him gently. ""I know. But the evil is leaving you now. Can you feel it? All that anger, all that hate‚Äîit's washing away.""

And that's when I saw O'Bryon's face.

He was smiling. Beatific. Like a saint in a painting. His eyes were wet with tears of joy as he cradled the convulsing, choking man in his arms.

""You're going to be so good now,"" O'Bryon whispered, pressing a kiss to Jeremiah's forehead, leaving a black smear across his skin. ""So, so good.""

Sebastian grabbed the phone with shaking hands. ""We got a breach, patient‚Äî"" his voice cracked, ""‚Äîpatient is expelling additional waste onto another prisoner. It's‚ÄîJesus Christ, it's going in him, it's‚Äî""

The phone slipped from his fingers and clattered to the desk.

On the monitor, Jeremiah had stopped fighting. His body went rigid, back arching, and then he began to seize. His limbs jerked in violent, unnatural angles. His eyes rolled back until only the yellowed whites showed.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dying,‚Äù Aguero said breathlessly.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so,‚Äù Jessica whispered in awe, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs being reborn.‚Äù

Kelly grabbed her shoulder. ""Jess, what the fuck‚Äî""

""Don't you see?"" She turned to us, and her eyes were bright, feverish. ""It's beautiful. He's being saved.""

Sebastian lunged for the shock controls, but before his hand reached the button, something changed.

Jeremiah's seizure stopped.

His body went completely still.

Other inmates had noticed. They were gathering around O'Bryon and Jeremiah, a slow circle forming. I counted six, then eight, then ten men, all watching with expressions I couldn't read from this distance.

They all collectively held their breaths.

Then Jeremiah sat up.

His movements were smooth now, controlled. He wiped the black residue from his mouth with an almost delicate gesture and looked down at his hands like he was seeing them for the first time. O'Bryon helped him to his feet, still smiling that terrible, gentle smile.

Jeremiah turned slowly to face the security camera. Even through the grainy footage, I could see it: his face had changed. The permanent scowl, the hard set of his jaw, the violence that had lived behind his eyes for years gone in a flash.¬†

He smiled. It was soft, serene, and utterly wrong on his face.

""Sofia."" Sebastian's voice sounded like it was coming from underwater. ""Sofia, go.""

I couldn't feel my legs. Couldn't feel anything except the ice spreading through my chest as I watched Jeremiah, the man who'd threatened to choke O'Bryon just a few days ago, wrap his arms around the former ‚ÄòMad Doctor‚Äô in an embrace.

""Sofia!"" Sebastian's shout snapped me back. He was pointing at the monitor with a trembling finger. ""Go,"" Sebastian said again, his voice breaking. ""Go let the administrator know we have a code N-6-P. Go, Sofia. Run.""

I ran.

But even as my feet pounded down the corridor, even as my hand fumbled for my radio, even as my mind screamed at me to move faster, faster, I couldn't shake the image burned into my brain: O'Bryon's face as that black substance poured from his mouth into Jeremiah's. The love in his eyes. The¬†[absolute certainty.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZJcortez/comments/1odnism/welcome/)",1,1761522321.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

some *ground* rules:

\- Grinder: should be really easy to use (doesn't require smashing the hopper to get the last bit of coffee out like my Mignon Zero), and can grind with any level you need (can choke the machine, but also can do filter)

\- Espresso: machine must have dual boilers (it's so annoying waiting for steam, but also you have to wait even longer if you wanted to make an espresso after it, or if you accidentally opened the machine on steam mode...) and should get the best out of the coffee, should be able to control how the flow works, but nothing fancy, only the needed stuff

\- Value for the money: the price should match the performance, can't be some 'premium' stuff that doesn't really add any value, like some automatic WDT for $500.

\- Combo is all the tools, from tamper to espresso machine, to even water filter

**Rule 1 when dealing with the ANGELS: Never tell them your past. The less they know about you, the better.**

My clothes proved unsalvageable, the disgusting stench clinging to the fabric after multiple washes. All of the tainted clothing met a swift end in the incinerator. The only other female in the room that day, Jessica, got it worse. Some of the black goo O‚ÄôBryon had spit up had gotten not just in her eyes, but even her mouth.¬†

Jessica was furious‚Äîrightfully so‚Äîscreaming about contamination and demanding medical evaluation. The woman had the foulest mouth on our team; I'd heard her call the warden things that would make a sailor blush. But after a closed-door meeting with our site administrator, she mostly stopped talking about the incident altogether.

Dr. Ricketts remained at our facility for the night, monitoring O‚ÄôBryon‚Äôs vitals and giving himself little pep talks in between the paces he did around our surveillance center.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna work, it‚Äôs gonna work! You‚Äôre a genius.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt sure if he was genuinely this egotistical or if he was simply trying to convince himself.

Nevertheless, O‚ÄôBryon survived the night. He slept soundly, a far cry from his usual night terror screams or erratic tosses and turns we had become accustomed to. We had been tasked with monitoring ‚Äòthe Mad Doctor‚Äô for two weeks before the procedure.¬†

As dawn cracked overhead, my last vestiges of consciousness were beginning to wear thin, just in time for my shift to close. I waved goodbye to my team, my first time leaving the facility in three days. My site administrator was there to greet me at the first exit.

‚ÄúSofia, can you go ahead and escort Dr. Ricketts to the primary exit?‚Äù Dr. Ricketts stood tense next to him. I lazily nodded my head, daydreaming about the ecstasy of my own bed as opposed to the unceremonious excuse for a cot I dwelt on here in the prison during longer shifts.

As we walked through the corridors, Dr. Ricketts bounced up and down, his glee barely contained. ‚ÄúYou realize you just witnessed history, right?‚Äù

I smiled weakly. ‚ÄúGlad I could be a part of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe revolutionized everything, the whole way our society works. This is Nobel Prize worthy, you know. Did you ever think you‚Äôd see that Monster act like a real human?‚Äù He said with gritted teeth, making sure to emphasize ‚ÄòMonster.‚Äô

‚ÄúI honestly can‚Äôt say I thought I would.‚Äù Part of me just wanted to humor Ricketts, desperate to get to my Corolla and on the road to my daughter, Abby. But another part of me was genuinely curious about what the hell I had been a part of. The monitoring, the preparation, and the candidate selection had taken up the last two months of my life, and I still didn‚Äôt know what was happening. ‚ÄúWhat was that exactly?‚Äù I blurted out before I could stop myself.

Ricketts looked less pleased than before. ‚ÄúWell, obviously, you lack the clearance to delve deep into the subject, but what you saw last night was the first human extraction of what you would qualify as ‚Äòevil.‚Äô All of us have bad thoughts, violent thoughts, evil thoughts. But we can control it, let it simmer below its boiling point. These people,‚Äù He cleared his throat, glancing around the hallway before dropping his tone an octave, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre different than us. Maybe they're weaker, or maybe there‚Äôs just more evil in them, but they can‚Äôt control it. So we have simply eliminated it.‚Äù

I stared forward down the hallway, nodding my head slowly.

‚ÄúSounds like it might put me out of a job,‚Äù I chuckled, glancing back towards Ricketts, who still seemed unamused.¬†

We walked in silence the rest of the way, each of us checking out of the facility. I offered a simple wave to Ricketts as I started for my car. He smiled.

‚ÄúSofia, right?‚Äù I nodded as he continued. ‚ÄúMonitor O‚ÄôBryon and if nothing goes awry, as I expect it won‚Äôt, the next time we meet, is when we are shooting a spot for the news, ok?‚Äù

I gave him a thumbs-up with a smile as I saw him skip off towards his distant car.

I lived about 30 minutes away from the facility, an hour outside the city. I collapsed in my bed, waking up just in time to catch my Abby returning home from school.¬†

‚ÄúMom, my cocoon hatched!‚Äù She exclaimed. Whipping out her phone and showing off pictures of her orange butterfly.¬†

‚ÄúWow, honey, that‚Äôs amazing,‚Äù I replied, embracing Abby in a hug in one hand while scrolling through the pictures of her butterfly in the other.¬†

It was a Friday, and I had planned to take her to the amusement park for the weekend when I got the first distressing message.

*Sofia,*¬†it read,¬†*report to the facility immediately. This is a mandatory report.*¬†

I had never gotten a message like this from work before.¬†

I called up my sister, Stacy. Stacy had been taking care of Abby for the past few days while I was on one of my marathon shifts at the facility.¬†

Stacy was a saint. She agreed to take Abby, and I scooped up my disappointed daughter in a full-bear hug before telling her we were going back to Aunt Stacy‚Äôs for a little bit.¬†

She was quiet on the car ride over. Aunt Stacy‚Äôs such a common place she slept, we didn‚Äôt even need to pack a bag for her, half her wardrobe and belongings were strewn across Stacy‚Äôs guest bedroom.

‚ÄúSo they can just call you in at any time, even when you took the weekend off?‚Äù Stacy‚Äôs tone struck a chord between sympathy and annoyance.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never happened before, but I guess there‚Äôs a first for everything,‚Äù I sighed, leaning up against my sister‚Äôs front porch. I pulled out the tickets from my purse. ‚ÄúLook, these were supposed to be a surprise for the weekend, two all-day passes.‚Äù¬†

Stacy shook her head before embracing me in a hug.

‚ÄúThey better be paying you triple!‚Äù she whispered in my ear.

When I got back to the facility, the parking lot was mostly empty. I buzzed in, going through security, meeting a frantic Jessica.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not letting us leave. All of them jerks, bad guys!‚Äù Jessica cried.¬†

It‚Äôs horseshit,‚Äù Aguero concurred, Jessica shooting him a glare.¬†

I saw the administrator appear over Aguero‚Äôs shoulder, straightening to attention. ‚ÄúI know you all are disappointed with the board‚Äôs decision, but they want this project to be perfect. You five are the only ones cleared to monitor our patient, O‚ÄôBryon, so make yourselves comfortable for the next seven days.‚Äù

The administrator stopped my protest before I could even start. ‚ÄúYour families have been notified, along with extended families who have taken on the burden left by your absence,‚Äù he extended an arm towards me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll all take solace that your compensation will be much greater than usual.‚Äù He turned heel and exited the room before we could badger him with any more questions.

‚ÄúWhat an asshole,‚Äù I muttered, causing Kelly to smirk and Jessica to audibly gasp.¬†

‚ÄúWell, you heard the boss,‚Äù Sebastian replied. Sebastian had been the guard to wheel in the mangled rabbit cart. ‚ÄúSofia and I can take the first shift, if the rest of you want some shut-eye,‚Äù he looked over at me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you got some sleep at home?‚Äù I nodded meekly.

O‚ÄôBryon sat on the screen mumbling to himself. The camera quality was substantially better than our normal set-up. He was smiling, his eyes seeming to sparkle.¬†

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been doing this all day,‚Äù Sebastian mumbled. ""He seems fine to me.""

I nodded, ‚ÄúHas he interacted with any of the other inmates?‚Äù  
Sebastian shook his head, ‚ÄúNot from what I‚Äôve seen.‚Äù

We sat there for the next few hours. The inmates ate dinner and started to return to their cells. Two nameless guards were walking O‚ÄôBryon towards a personal cell that he had inhabited for the past month when the phone in front of Sebastian rang.

Sebastian answered.

‚ÄúYes---Ahh, ok sir‚Ä¶.Immediately?--Ok, I‚Äôll let them know.‚Äù He pressed a button in front of us and put the microphone to his mouth.

‚ÄúThe patient can return to his normal living quarters.‚Äù The two guards looked up to the camera and nodded, doubling back and leading O‚ÄôBryon back to his original cell. Sebastian hit the table in front of me twice to get my attention. ‚ÄúSofia, can you monitor the audio? You should be able to hear them now,‚Äù He claimed, pressing another button and handing me a pair of headphones.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre back?‚Äù a straggly voice exclaimed.¬†

‚ÄúOh, Jeremiah, it is good to see you again!‚Äù O‚ÄôBryon said cheerfully.¬†

‚ÄúGet your hands off of me! What the hell are you doing?‚Äù I was about to warn Sebastian of the incident when he finished flicking a few switches, and O‚ÄôBryon‚Äôs cell suddenly popped up on one of our monitors.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a hug, Jeremiah, I hope we can start anew.‚Äù

‚ÄúGet the fuck off me, freak!‚Äù Jeremiah shoved O‚ÄôBryon back.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Jeremiah. I should have known better.‚Äù O‚ÄôBryon replied remorsefully, plopping down on the bottom bunk.

‚ÄúTop bunk.‚Äù Jeremiah threatened. O‚ÄôBryon nodded and climbed up to the top.¬†

‚ÄúDid it lobotomize him? He‚Äôs a pushover now.‚Äù Sebastian wondered aloud, now sporting headphones of his own. I shrugged in agreement.¬†

‚ÄúWhy are you like this?‚Äù O‚ÄôBryon asked down towards Jeremiah as the two took their places in the bunk bed.¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you ask?‚Äù Jeremiah looked up, puzzled.¬†

‚ÄúWhy are you so angry all the time?‚Äù O‚ÄôBryon‚Äôs eyes looked sad.

‚ÄúThis is some sort of weird ass-test?‚Äù Jeremiah wore a look of concern, almost cowering, looking up at the former ‚ÄòMad Doctor.‚Äô

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to help, get to know the real you. Why are you here, Jeremiah?‚Äù Jeremiah looked up suspiciously.¬†

‚ÄúI was set up, they said I killed my wife, but I wasn‚Äôt anywhere near that bitch‚Äôs house.‚Äù Jeremiah turned his body and looked at the wall. ‚ÄúYou know, you‚Äôre one to ask, you know they call you the ‚ÄòMad Doctor‚Äô, don‚Äôt ya?‚Äù

O‚ÄôBryon closed his eyes and sighed. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt fix the past, but we can turn a new leaf, can‚Äôt we, Jeremiah?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt shut up, up there, I swear to god I‚Äôll fucking choke you out, old man.‚Äù

I reached for the phone, ready to warn the guards of Jeremiah‚Äôs expected violent outbursts, but Sebastian stopped me.¬†

‚ÄúRemember, Jessica had to implant the patient‚Äôs cellmate with the probes,‚Äù he motioned to another button, ‚Äúhe lays a finger on O‚ÄôBryon and we‚Äôre gonna shock him halfway to death.‚Äù

I nodded slowly. Sebastian took a lot more pride in our work than I did and took everything a lot more seriously than I had the last few weeks. The peculiar nature of the situation made me regret merely going through the motions.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù I inquired, forcing a yawn to retreat, pointing towards the central screen. O‚ÄôBryon, a permanent recluse in the dining hall, seemed to be leading a gaggle of four men at a table, Jeremiah sitting next to him.¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so,‚Äù Jessica whispered in awe, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs being reborn.‚Äù

Kelly grabbed her shoulder. ""Jess, what the fuck‚Äî""

""Don't you see?"" She turned to us, and her eyes were bright, feverish. ""It's beautiful. He's being saved.""

Sebastian lunged for the shock controls, but before his hand reached the button, something changed.

Jeremiah's seizure stopped.

His body went completely still.

Other inmates had noticed. They were gathering around O'Bryon and Jeremiah, a slow circle forming. I counted six, then eight, then ten men, all watching with expressions I couldn't read from this distance.

They all collectively held their breaths.

Then Jeremiah sat up.

His movements were smooth now, controlled. He wiped the black residue from his mouth with an almost delicate gesture and looked down at his hands like he was seeing them for the first time. O'Bryon helped him to his feet, still smiling that terrible, gentle smile.

Jeremiah turned slowly to face the security camera. Even through the grainy footage, I could see it: his face had changed. The permanent scowl, the hard set of his jaw, the violence that had lived behind his eyes for years gone in a flash.¬†

He smiled. It was soft, serene, and utterly wrong on his face.

""Sofia."" Sebastian's voice sounded like it was coming from underwater. ""Sofia, go.""

I couldn't feel my legs. Couldn't feel anything except the ice spreading through my chest as I watched Jeremiah, the man who'd threatened to choke O'Bryon just a few days ago, wrap his arms around the former ‚ÄòMad Doctor‚Äô in an embrace.

""Sofia!"" Sebastian's shout snapped me back. He was pointing at the monitor with a trembling finger. ""Go,"" Sebastian said again, his voice breaking. ""Go let the administrator know we have a code N-6-P. Go, Sofia. Run.""

I ran.

But even as my feet pounded down the corridor, even as my hand fumbled for my radio, even as my mind screamed at me to move faster, faster, I couldn't shake the image burned into my brain: O'Bryon's face as that black substance poured from his mouth into Jeremiah's. The love in his eyes. The¬†absolute certainty. ",6,1761522122.0,scarystories,2,1.0,False
1ogzk25,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeanDrop/comments/1ogzk25/read_this_first_hello_and_a_quick_intro_to/,Read this first: Hello and a quick intro to BeanDrop,"Hi there, I started this initiative mainly because I find myself wanting to try lots of different coffees but also not commit to buying full bags. Mainly inspired by the coffeerotation sub, this is an **Australian based** and **Filter-focused** speciality coffee group (I'm in Melb) where I'm hoping I can find like-minded coffee nerds to split some bags with.

The idea is that I will buy a few bags, with each 'drop' having a theme - whether that's a notable roaster, an origin or processing. I'll then split the coffee into 50g doses and then ship them out. I am hoping that as a little community of people brewing the same coffee, we can offer helpful tips and tricks to get the best out of the beans.

This is not a commercial initiative or business, in fact it takes quite a bit of time and effort to organise these sorts of things, but I will try to keep it priced reasonable. My hope is that we all get to try lots of different rare and sought after coffees at a price point that is approachable for most. I will provide a breakdown of costs for each drop so people know what goes into the price build.

Happy to take ideas or polling on which beans/roasters to approach. I think the drops will largely feature 'fancier' and rarer beans given the effort to do this, and I'd love to feature smaller Aus based roasters or even highly regarded international roasters (eg Japanese, Nordic roasters). Getting one larger bulk buy for international roasters will probably make it more cost-effective as well.

That's all for now - looking forward to community and coffee here at BeanDrop :)",1,1761522103.0,BeanDrop,0,1.0,False

So just recently about 2 weeks ago I came down with some type of upper respiratory illness and had to do a round of antibiotics, well as I was nearing the end of the round of antibiotics I noticed I was becoming more sensitive to caffeine by the day so I cut it back slowly each day, until eventually one day it took only 1 cup of coffee to send my nervous system into overdrive and gave me a severe panic attack in the middle of church. It was so bad that my adrenaline was pumping days later til I finally went to the ER and they put me on Beta Blockers to control the adrenaline surges....so I guess my question is, is there some relation to illness or antibiotics and complete caffeine intolerance?

1ogzime,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfortLevelPod/comments/1ogzime/trying_to_hold_it_together_might_be_a_long_read/,Trying to hold it together - might be a long read,"My girlfriend 27f said she needed space and wanted to take a break about 3 months ago. I 28m have been doing everything I can to make this work. We‚Äôve been together for 8 years and long story short there was a communication breakdown while the business I was running for the last 4 years was starting to fail and I was going broke. When that was going down I was pretty much just shutting down and wasn‚Äôt present when I was with her. (closed the doors on the business maybe 5 days before our break started - walked away from the business with next to nothing to my name and have since started a regular job in finance) 

My approach to the break has been as respectful as possible. I accepted the break and told her I want to work this out. We went a full 2 months of no contact and during that time I started therapy. My idea going into therapy wasn‚Äôt just to get her back, I actually wanted to fix myself just so I can feel better about myself and never do this again - even if we don‚Äôt work this out and I eventually enter a relationship with someone new. I have battled with my mental health way before I ever met her and probably should have been in therapy as a teenager. (I didn‚Äôt tell her I started therapy until last week after 8 sessions) 

We‚Äôre somewhat back in contact now, it started with a text conversation initiated by her a few weeks back where she was texting back every message within minutes and was genuinely engaged in the conversation. I kept the pressure off and didn‚Äôt try to force her into a conversation about the breakup, but I was so happy to be in contact with her. 

We then spoke on the phone last week and it was awesome, we were cracking jokes and just talking like we used to. I still didn‚Äôt want to put any pressure on her to ‚Äúmake a decision‚Äù but I suggested we grab a coffee because I haven‚Äôt seen her once since the break started. 

A few days passed and I texted to see if she was still down for a coffee over the weekend. It took her over 24 hours to respond and she didn‚Äôt tell me yes or no, but we didn‚Äôt meet up. 

That really crushed me almost back to square one where I‚Äôve been just devastated the last few days. 

I‚Äôm also very confused because she still has all of our pictures on social media. 

I‚Äôm looking to do whatever I can to see this through and repair the relationship. I have taken the time to think it through and determine whether or not I want to work on it. I do feel like there‚Äôs something special here that is worth working on. 

When the relationship was breaking down, I was absolutely in the wrong and have taken full accountability for that. I should have leaned towards her instead of shutting down but truthfully, I was depressed and felt like a zombie in everything I was doing. Before we went on a break, I wasn‚Äôt eating or sleeping and was losing weight to the point where I didn‚Äôt look or feel healthy. I was also drinking and getting stoned way more than I‚Äôd like to admit, I have put all of that stuff down and got back in the gym, ultimately gaining the weight I lost back (I look and feel way better now) 

So I don‚Äôt blame her at all for needing space, I actually think it‚Äôs exactly what our relationship needed, but I didn‚Äôt see all of this coming and I‚Äôm not even sure if she still sees this as a ‚Äúbreak.‚Äù I guess the best way to put it is that I‚Äôve been getting mixed signals and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm thinking about trying again to grab a coffee next weekend. 

If anyone has a few words of encouragement that would go a long way - thank you for reading this.

**Rule 1 when dealing with the ANGELS: Never tell them your past. The less they know about you, the better.**

My clothes proved unsalvageable, the disgusting stench clinging to the fabric after multiple washes. All of the tainted clothing met a swift end in the incinerator. The only other female in the room that day, Jessica, got it worse. Some of the black goo O‚ÄôBryon had spit up had gotten not just in her eyes, but even her mouth.¬†

Jessica was furious‚Äîrightfully so‚Äîscreaming about contamination and demanding medical evaluation. The woman had the foulest mouth on our team; I'd heard her call the warden things that would make a sailor blush. But after a closed-door meeting with our site administrator, she mostly stopped talking about the incident altogether.

Dr. Ricketts remained at our facility for the night, monitoring O‚ÄôBryon‚Äôs vitals and giving himself little pep talks in between the paces he did around our surveillance center.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna work, it‚Äôs gonna work! You‚Äôre a genius.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt sure if he was genuinely this egotistical or if he was simply trying to convince himself.

Nevertheless, O‚ÄôBryon survived the night. He slept soundly, a far cry from his usual night terror screams or erratic tosses and turns we had become accustomed to. We had been tasked with monitoring ‚Äòthe Mad Doctor‚Äô for two weeks before the procedure.¬†

As dawn cracked overhead, my last vestiges of consciousness were beginning to wear thin, just in time for my shift to close. I waved goodbye to my team, my first time leaving the facility in three days. My site administrator was there to greet me at the first exit.

‚ÄúSofia, can you go ahead and escort Dr. Ricketts to the primary exit?‚Äù Dr. Ricketts stood tense next to him. I lazily nodded my head, daydreaming about the ecstasy of my own bed as opposed to the unceremonious excuse for a cot I dwelt on here in the prison during longer shifts.

As we walked through the corridors, Dr. Ricketts bounced up and down, his glee barely contained. ‚ÄúYou realize you just witnessed history, right?‚Äù

I smiled weakly. ‚ÄúGlad I could be a part of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe revolutionized everything, the whole way our society works. This is Nobel Prize worthy, you know. Did you ever think you‚Äôd see that Monster act like a real human?‚Äù He said with gritted teeth, making sure to emphasize ‚ÄòMonster.‚Äô

‚ÄúI honestly can‚Äôt say I thought I would.‚Äù Part of me just wanted to humor Ricketts, desperate to get to my Corolla and on the road to my daughter, Abby. But another part of me was genuinely curious about what the hell I had been a part of. The monitoring, the preparation, and the candidate selection had taken up the last two months of my life, and I still didn‚Äôt know what was happening. ‚ÄúWhat was that exactly?‚Äù I blurted out before I could stop myself.

Ricketts looked less pleased than before. ‚ÄúWell, obviously, you lack the clearance to delve deep into the subject, but what you saw last night was the first human extraction of what you would qualify as ‚Äòevil.‚Äô All of us have bad thoughts, violent thoughts, evil thoughts. But we can control it, let it simmer below its boiling point. These people,‚Äù He cleared his throat, glancing around the hallway before dropping his tone an octave, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre different than us. Maybe they're weaker, or maybe there‚Äôs just more evil in them, but they can‚Äôt control it. So we have simply eliminated it.‚Äù

I stared forward down the hallway, nodding my head slowly.

‚ÄúSounds like it might put me out of a job,‚Äù I chuckled, glancing back towards Ricketts, who still seemed unamused.¬†

We walked in silence the rest of the way, each of us checking out of the facility. I offered a simple wave to Ricketts as I started for my car. He smiled.

‚ÄúSofia, right?‚Äù I nodded as he continued. ‚ÄúMonitor O‚ÄôBryon and if nothing goes awry, as I expect it won‚Äôt, the next time we meet, is when we are shooting a spot for the news, ok?‚Äù

I gave him a thumbs-up with a smile as I saw him skip off towards his distant car.

I lived about 30 minutes away from the facility, an hour outside the city. I collapsed in my bed, waking up just in time to catch my Abby returning home from school.¬†

‚ÄúMom, my cocoon hatched!‚Äù She exclaimed. Whipping out her phone and showing off pictures of her orange butterfly.¬†

‚ÄúWow, honey, that‚Äôs amazing,‚Äù I replied, embracing Abby in a hug in one hand while scrolling through the pictures of her butterfly in the other.¬†

It was a Friday, and I had planned to take her to the amusement park for the weekend when I got the first distressing message.

*Sofia,*¬†it read,¬†*report to the facility immediately. This is a mandatory report.*¬†

I had never gotten a message like this from work before.¬†

I called up my sister, Stacy. Stacy had been taking care of Abby for the past few days while I was on one of my marathon shifts at the facility.¬†

Stacy was a saint. She agreed to take Abby, and I scooped up my disappointed daughter in a full-bear hug before telling her we were going back to Aunt Stacy‚Äôs for a little bit.¬†

She was quiet on the car ride over. Aunt Stacy‚Äôs such a common place she slept, we didn‚Äôt even need to pack a bag for her, half her wardrobe and belongings were strewn across Stacy‚Äôs guest bedroom.

‚ÄúSo they can just call you in at any time, even when you took the weekend off?‚Äù Stacy‚Äôs tone struck a chord between sympathy and annoyance.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never happened before, but I guess there‚Äôs a first for everything,‚Äù I sighed, leaning up against my sister‚Äôs front porch. I pulled out the tickets from my purse. ‚ÄúLook, these were supposed to be a surprise for the weekend, two all-day passes.‚Äù¬†

Stacy shook her head before embracing me in a hug.

‚ÄúThey better be paying you triple!‚Äù she whispered in my ear.

When I got back to the facility, the parking lot was mostly empty. I buzzed in, going through security, meeting a frantic Jessica.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not letting us leave. All of them jerks, bad guys!‚Äù Jessica cried.¬†

It‚Äôs horseshit,‚Äù Aguero concurred, Jessica shooting him a glare.¬†

I saw the administrator appear over Aguero‚Äôs shoulder, straightening to attention. ‚ÄúI know you all are disappointed with the board‚Äôs decision, but they want this project to be perfect. You five are the only ones cleared to monitor our patient, O‚ÄôBryon, so make yourselves comfortable for the next seven days.‚Äù

The administrator stopped my protest before I could even start. ‚ÄúYour families have been notified, along with extended families who have taken on the burden left by your absence,‚Äù he extended an arm towards me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll all take solace that your compensation will be much greater than usual.‚Äù He turned heel and exited the room before we could badger him with any more questions.

‚ÄúWhat an asshole,‚Äù I muttered, causing Kelly to smirk and Jessica to audibly gasp.¬†

‚ÄúWell, you heard the boss,‚Äù Sebastian replied. Sebastian had been the guard to wheel in the mangled rabbit cart. ‚ÄúSofia and I can take the first shift, if the rest of you want some shut-eye,‚Äù he looked over at me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you got some sleep at home?‚Äù I nodded meekly.

O‚ÄôBryon sat on the screen mumbling to himself. The camera quality was substantially better than our normal set-up. He was smiling, his eyes seeming to sparkle.¬†

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been doing this all day,‚Äù Sebastian mumbled. ""He seems fine to me.""

I nodded, ‚ÄúHas he interacted with any of the other inmates?‚Äù  
Sebastian shook his head, ‚ÄúNot from what I‚Äôve seen.‚Äù

We sat there for the next few hours. The inmates ate dinner and started to return to their cells. Two nameless guards were walking O‚ÄôBryon towards a personal cell that he had inhabited for the past month when the phone in front of Sebastian rang.

Sebastian answered.

‚ÄúYes---Ahh, ok sir‚Ä¶.Immediately?--Ok, I‚Äôll let them know.‚Äù He pressed a button in front of us and put the microphone to his mouth.

‚ÄúThe patient can return to his normal living quarters.‚Äù The two guards looked up to the camera and nodded, doubling back and leading O‚ÄôBryon back to his original cell. Sebastian hit the table in front of me twice to get my attention. ‚ÄúSofia, can you monitor the audio? You should be able to hear them now,‚Äù He claimed, pressing another button and handing me a pair of headphones.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre back?‚Äù a straggly voice exclaimed.¬†

‚ÄúOh, Jeremiah, it is good to see you again!‚Äù O‚ÄôBryon said cheerfully.¬†

‚ÄúGet your hands off of me! What the hell are you doing?‚Äù I was about to warn Sebastian of the incident when he finished flicking a few switches, and O‚ÄôBryon‚Äôs cell suddenly popped up on one of our monitors.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a hug, Jeremiah, I hope we can start anew.‚Äù

‚ÄúGet the fuck off me, freak!‚Äù Jeremiah shoved O‚ÄôBryon back.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Jeremiah. I should have known better.‚Äù O‚ÄôBryon replied remorsefully, plopping down on the bottom bunk.

‚ÄúTop bunk.‚Äù Jeremiah threatened. O‚ÄôBryon nodded and climbed up to the top.¬†

‚ÄúDid it lobotomize him? He‚Äôs a pushover now.‚Äù Sebastian wondered aloud, now sporting headphones of his own. I shrugged in agreement.¬†

‚ÄúWhy are you like this?‚Äù O‚ÄôBryon asked down towards Jeremiah as the two took their places in the bunk bed.¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you ask?‚Äù Jeremiah looked up, puzzled.¬†

‚ÄúWhy are you so angry all the time?‚Äù O‚ÄôBryon‚Äôs eyes looked sad.

‚ÄúThis is some sort of weird ass-test?‚Äù Jeremiah wore a look of concern, almost cowering, looking up at the former ‚ÄòMad Doctor.‚Äô

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to help, get to know the real you. Why are you here, Jeremiah?‚Äù Jeremiah looked up suspiciously.¬†

‚ÄúI was set up, they said I killed my wife, but I wasn‚Äôt anywhere near that bitch‚Äôs house.‚Äù Jeremiah turned his body and looked at the wall. ‚ÄúYou know, you‚Äôre one to ask, you know they call you the ‚ÄòMad Doctor‚Äô, don‚Äôt ya?‚Äù

O‚ÄôBryon closed his eyes and sighed. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt fix the past, but we can turn a new leaf, can‚Äôt we, Jeremiah?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt shut up, up there, I swear to god I‚Äôll fucking choke you out, old man.‚Äù

I reached for the phone, ready to warn the guards of Jeremiah‚Äôs expected violent outbursts, but Sebastian stopped me.¬†

‚ÄúRemember, Jessica had to implant the patient‚Äôs cellmate with the probes,‚Äù he motioned to another button, ‚Äúhe lays a finger on O‚ÄôBryon and we‚Äôre gonna shock him halfway to death.‚Äù

I nodded slowly. Sebastian took a lot more pride in our work than I did and took everything a lot more seriously than I had the last few weeks. The peculiar nature of the situation made me regret merely going through the motions.¬†

The two kept talking. O‚ÄôBryon would try to pry deeper into Jeremiah‚Äôs personal life while Jeremiah would shout back vague threats and insults. I felt a tap on my shoulder as Kelly took my shift.

It felt like hours before I finally drifted off to sleep. My sleeping chamber was pitch-black. I don‚Äôt know if it was still night or finally morning when I felt Jessica rousing me awake, light from the hallway pouring into my quarters.¬†

‚ÄúWas that too rough?‚Äù She worried as she grasped both of her shoulders.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù I said a little grouchy, still fighting off the last bastions of sleep.¬†

‚ÄúOh my bad. It‚Äôs your turn on shift, but if you want to catch a few more Zzzzs, I can go a little longer.‚Äù¬†

I scowled at her, confident that she was being sarcastic. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fine, alright, I‚Äôll be up in a sec.‚Äù

I marched into the control room, greeted by sunlight. Sebastian, Kelly, and Aguero all sat around the monitors sipping coffee.¬†

‚ÄúMade you a cup.‚Äù Kelly held up a styrofoam offering. I accepted it, brushing out the sleepiness from my eyes.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù I inquired, forcing a yawn to retreat, pointing towards the central screen. O‚ÄôBryon, a permanent recluse in the dining hall, seemed to be leading a gaggle of four men at a table, Jeremiah sitting next to him.¬†

‚ÄúJeremiah finally opened up to the old man. Heard he‚Äôs taken him to the Prisoner‚Äôs Prom,‚Äù Sebastian laughed.¬†

The whole day in the yard, at meals, when they were just sitting around, Jeremiah and O‚ÄôBryon seemed attached at the hip. They exchanged stories, told jokes, O‚ÄôBryon‚Äôs staying G while Jeremiah‚Äôs jokes ventured deep into R-rated territory, and expressed remorse that they hadn‚Äôt been friendlier sooner.¬†

It went on this way for two more days. Each hour watching the newly reformed O‚ÄôBryon made me more and more of a believer in the ANGEL treatment. Sure, Ricketts may have seemed a bit crazy with a serious God-complex, but here before my eyes, I saw a man, famous for disfigurement and murder, now seriously seem like he wouldn‚Äôt hurt a fly.¬†

It was around noon when the first incident happened.

O'Bryon led Jeremiah to a small patch of grass in the mostly dirt-filled prison yard.

""Are you ready for this next step?"" O'Bryon asked, our control center was able to pick up every sound and sight in the facility. Jeremiah gave a half-hearted nod before lowering to his knees.

All five of us were in the control room. Most of us had slowly lost interest in the project, counting down the days of the week until we were finally granted our freedom. Jessica had taken more of an interest in O'Bryon and Jeremiah's budding friendship and called for our attention as Jeremiah slowly got to his knees.

""I know they're both in prison and haven't seen a woman in a while, but he's not gonna-"" Kelly stopped when Jessica shot him a dirty look.

Jeremiah looked nervous. He got back to his feet and gave O'Bryon a small push back.

""I don't know about this, man. Let's just go back to normal, ok?""

O'Bryon's face fell. For a moment, he looked genuinely heartbroken, like a father watching his son reject salvation. He placed a limp hand on Jeremiah's shoulder.

""Ok, Jeremiah. It's ok.""

Then his fingers dug in.

O'Bryon's arm snapped around Jeremiah's throat with inhuman speed, the chokehold so tight I could see Jeremiah's face already darkening on the monitor. ""But there's evil in you, son. So much evil."" His voice was gentle, almost loving, even as Jeremiah's feet kicked desperately against the dirt.

""What the fuck‚Äî"" Kelly started, but the words died in his throat.

O'Bryon's free hand clamped over Jeremiah's jaw, fingers forcing their way between his lips. Jeremiah's scream came out muffled and wet as O'Bryon pried his mouth open like he was cracking a shell. I could see Jeremiah's teeth cutting into O'Bryon's fingers, blood mixing with saliva, but O'Bryon didn't even flinch.

""I'm saving you,"" O'Bryon whispered, pulling Jeremiah closer, almost tender. ""I'm saving you, son.""

Then his jaw unhinged.

The joints popped with sounds our audio picked up all too clearly. His throat convulsed, once, twice, and then it came.

The black goo erupted from O'Bryon's mouth in a thick, pulsating torrent. It forced its way into Jeremiah's mouth like it was alive, like it had purpose. Jeremiah's eyes went wide with pure animal terror, his body convulsing as the substance flooded down his throat. He tried to bite down, tried to turn his head, but O'Bryon held him fast, their mouths pressed together in an obscene mockery of intimacy.

Jeremiah's screams turned to choking gurgles. His hands clawed at O'Bryon's face, drawing blood, but O'Bryon just stroked his hair with his free hand like he was comforting a frightened child.

The black goo overflowed from the corners of Jeremiah's mouth, running down his chin, his neck, soaking into his orange jumpsuit. His throat worked frantically, forced to swallow, drowning in it.

""Jesus Christ,"" Aguero breathed beside me. ""Jesus fucking Christ.""

I couldn't move. None of us could. We just watched as Jeremiah's struggles grew weaker, his kicks becoming twitches. The black substance seemed to pulse with its own heartbeat as it transferred from one body to another, and I swore I could see it moving beneath Jeremiah's skin, spreading through his veins like ink in water.

O'Bryon finally pulled away. The disconnect made a wet, sucking sound that made my stomach lurch. Jeremiah collapsed to his knees, black ooze pouring from his mouth and nose, his whole body heaving as he vomited more of it onto the grass. His hands clutched at his throat, at his chest, fingers scrabbling like he was trying to claw the substance back out.

O'Bryon knelt beside him, gathering him into his arms. Jeremiah was crying now, animal sounds of anguish and terror, his face a mask of black slime, tears, and blood.

""I know it hurts,"" O'Bryon murmured, rocking him gently. ""I know. But the evil is leaving you now. Can you feel it? All that anger, all that hate‚Äîit's washing away.""

And that's when I saw O'Bryon's face.

He was smiling. Beatific. Like a saint in a painting. His eyes were wet with tears of joy as he cradled the convulsing, choking man in his arms.

""You're going to be so good now,"" O'Bryon whispered, pressing a kiss to Jeremiah's forehead, leaving a black smear across his skin. ""So, so good.""

Sebastian grabbed the phone with shaking hands. ""We got a breach, patient‚Äî"" his voice cracked, ""‚Äîpatient is expelling additional waste onto another prisoner. It's‚ÄîJesus Christ, it's going in him, it's‚Äî""

The phone slipped from his fingers and clattered to the desk.

On the monitor, Jeremiah had stopped fighting. His body went rigid, back arching, and then he began to seize. His limbs jerked in violent, unnatural angles. His eyes rolled back until only the yellowed whites showed.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dying,‚Äù Aguero said breathlessly.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so,‚Äù Jessica whispered in awe, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs being reborn.‚Äù

Kelly grabbed her shoulder. ""Jess, what the fuck‚Äî""

""Don't you see?"" She turned to us, and her eyes were bright, feverish. ""It's beautiful. He's being saved.""

Sebastian lunged for the shock controls, but before his hand reached the button, something changed.

Jeremiah's seizure stopped.

His body went completely still.

Other inmates had noticed. They were gathering around O'Bryon and Jeremiah, a slow circle forming. I counted six, then eight, then ten men, all watching with expressions I couldn't read from this distance.

They all collectively held their breaths.

Then Jeremiah sat up.

His movements were smooth now, controlled. He wiped the black residue from his mouth with an almost delicate gesture and looked down at his hands like he was seeing them for the first time. O'Bryon helped him to his feet, still smiling that terrible, gentle smile.

Jeremiah turned slowly to face the security camera. Even through the grainy footage, I could see it: his face had changed. The permanent scowl, the hard set of his jaw, the violence that had lived behind his eyes for years gone in a flash.¬†

He smiled. It was soft, serene, and utterly wrong on his face.

""Sofia."" Sebastian's voice sounded like it was coming from underwater. ""Sofia, go.""

I couldn't feel my legs. Couldn't feel anything except the ice spreading through my chest as I watched Jeremiah, the man who'd threatened to choke O'Bryon just a few days ago, wrap his arms around the former ‚ÄòMad Doctor‚Äô in an embrace.

""Sofia!"" Sebastian's shout snapped me back. He was pointing at the monitor with a trembling finger. ""Go,"" Sebastian said again, his voice breaking. ""Go let the administrator know we have a code N-6-P. Go, Sofia. Run.""

I ran.

But even as my feet pounded down the corridor, even as my hand fumbled for my radio, even as my mind screamed at me to move faster, faster, I couldn't shake the image burned into my brain: O'Bryon's face as that black substance poured from his mouth into Jeremiah's.

1ogzewf,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1ogzewf/today_i_went_to_a_nonjw_church_for_the_first_time/,"Today, I went to a non-JW church for the first time.","I was raised a JW, and I grew up always hearing the same things about churches. That only the Kingdom Hall has true Christian love. That they are only out for money and collections. That they are stuffy and stiff with no audience participation like the JW meetings. That the churches are full of idols that people bow to in worship. Ruthless preachers. I remember hearing many times that they often don't even open the Bible. 

I don't doubt that is true for some churches, but my experience was so different from what I was told to expect. 

For reference, I no longer consider myself Christian, but I have a deep respect for people who use Jesus' teachings as a model for kindness and good in the world. A goal of mine is to experience church services for multiple denominations, so that I can more accurately unpack the things I was taught as fact growing up. Fact that is, indeed, often exaggerated or even fabricated.

Today I finally got the courage to go to a service. I attended an evangelic Christian church; very Protestant in nature. 

When I arrived, I was warmly greeted and welcomed to come join everyone. I was told to help myself to a cup of coffee. It seems that every morning before the service, they have coffee together and chat. Everyone was friendly, both to me and to each other, in a way that didn't feel like an attempt to force themselves on me like I often felt when I would go to a new Kingdom Hall.

At 11am, the service started. Some people left their coffee on the tables in that area, others brought their cups with them to their seats. The building was aged, but well-maintained, with beautiful stained glass windows. The ceiling sparkled like stars. I noticed it lacked carved images of Jesus or Mary, but had a large cross on the stage and a cross carved into the podium. It was decorated with seasonal plants, pumpkins, and soft lights.

The pastor opened with a quick prayer, then invited two children up to the stage. I learned later that they had approached the pastor and asked if they could give this presentation, and he happily accommodated it. The kids had written a short history of Martin Luther King and one of his hymns. A lady began playing the hymn on the piano and the kids sung the first verse, then invited everyone else to join in and sing the rest. I wish I could remember the name of the hymn they sang; it was in the church's hymn book.

After that, the pastor returned, read from the Bible, and gave a short explanation on how it can be applied. More hymns were sung, played on piano with the lyrics displayed on screen. We went through four songs, and the older woman in front of me would sometimes ad lib praises to the Lord during pauses. 

Then was a 30 minute talk, much like the talks at the Sunday JW meetings. Except instead of being interwoven with what you should do for the governing body/JW organization or fear mongering or guilt tripping, it focused entirely on the Bible. The speaker talked about how true greatness is found not in fame, money, or beauty, but in humbly following the example of Jesus. 

The program ended with one more hymn and then prayer time. It seemed one of the church regulars was moving away, and the pastor invited people to pray for him. Multiple people went up to the front and prayed over him for his wellbeing. The pastor then asked if anyone else had things they would like to be prayed for, and a few people mentioned their struggles, struggles of their family, or just shared some positive thoughts to include in prayer. The pastor gave everyone time to briefly pray in silence, then gave a concluding prayer where he incorporated all the things they'd brought up. 

Afterwards, I was invited to stay for lunch in the common area. I asked how much it would cost and I was assured there is no charge. People had brought cooked food dishes, dessert, sides, etc and they sat together and ate. Someone mentioned that there are some people who don't feel comfortable coming for the church service but will come for the lunch, and they are always welcome. I was told if I ever want to come, even just to have a meal, I can. 

While eating, I saw how people interacted freely with each other. No one stayed in their little cliques as I often witnessed at Kingdom Halls. They moved the tables close together so everyone was close and eating like it was a large family gathering. 

I left feeling very positive. People often say spirituality makes their hearts feel calmer, lighter. I never understood that because I always felt suffocated at meetings. Now I understand them better. The warmth people showed was genuine and sincere. These were people that believed in the Bible and applied it without the burden of also serving the whims of the governing body. It was not too dissimilar to a JW meeting structure in some ways, but less stiff, inviting more non-scripted audience participation, and very musically-focused.

I would happily return, and I think a lot of JWs that have never been to a church before would be shocked by this. I wish I could tell my cousins and old friends about it. So much of what they are seeking as Christians is out there, but they will not find it because they are stuck in a religion that sucks the life out of them. I'm convinced that if some of the JWs I know went in there with a truly open mind, they'd never step foot in a Kingdom Hall again.

I look forward to experiencing more different churches and denominations to get a better impression of the people JWs refer to as ""misguided"". If anyone has recommendations for denominations that might be a good next step to experience, please feel free to suggest what I can try next.",16,1761521710.0,exjw,4,0.95,False

Of course, I plan to keep reading about prehistory, but enough of putting myself at the center of it, haha...

I‚Äôm South American, Uruguayan and Brazilian, descended from recent European immigrants (3‚Äì4 generations back), but with some older colonial lineages of somewhat unknown origin. I think the test was quite accurate, even correctly picking up my sub-Saharan signal (I have a great-great-grandfather who was the son of a coffee plantation owner and an enslaved black woman).

Apparently, my deep ancestry is overwhelmingly that of Neolithic farmers from Anatolia. So, after Africa, cradle of all humanity, I guess Turkey is the land I should call ‚Äúmother,‚Äù hahaha‚Ä¶ Still, I have a considerable steppe ancestry (20%), which seems quite consistent with people of southern European or Mediterranean backgrounds.

In the population distance chart, I‚Äôm closest to Canary Spaniards, even though I have no known ancestry from there. I think that similarity comes from a strong North African component, so much so that I‚Äôm next closest to Portuguese and Galicians, populations from the Atlantic side of the Iberian Peninsula, where North African ancestry averages over 10%. It‚Äôs no wonder my proximity chart to ancient populations is led by Al-Andalus. After those groups, I get close to Liguria, in northern Italy, which actually matches the origin of two of my great-great-grandparents!

Finally, on the European PCA, I fall squarely within the Tuscan cluster, while on the American one, interestingly, I‚Äôm closer to White Americans than to other Latinos.",2,1761521601.0,illustrativeDNA,0,1.0,False

Rule 1 when dealing with the ANGELS: Never tell them your past. The less they know about you, the better.

My clothes proved unsalvageable, the disgusting stench clinging to the fabric after multiple washes. All of the tainted clothing met a swift end in the incinerator. The only other female in the room that day, Jessica, got it worse. Some of the black goo O‚ÄôBryon had spit up had gotten not just in her eyes, but even her mouth.¬†

Jessica was furious‚Äîrightfully so‚Äîscreaming about contamination and demanding medical evaluation. The woman had the foulest mouth on our team; I'd heard her call the warden things that would make a sailor blush. But after a closed-door meeting with our site administrator, she mostly stopped talking about the incident altogether.

Dr. Ricketts remained at our facility for the night, monitoring O‚ÄôBryon‚Äôs vitals and giving himself little pep talks in between the paces he did around our surveillance center.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna work, it‚Äôs gonna work! You‚Äôre a genius.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt sure if he was genuinely this egotistical or if he was simply trying to convince himself.

Nevertheless, O‚ÄôBryon survived the night. He slept soundly, a far cry from his usual night terror screams or erratic tosses and turns we had become accustomed to. We had been tasked with monitoring ‚Äòthe Mad Doctor‚Äô for two weeks before the procedure.¬†

As dawn cracked overhead, my last vestiges of consciousness were beginning to wear thin, just in time for my shift to close. I waved goodbye to my team, my first time leaving the facility in three days. My site administrator was there to greet me at the first exit.

‚ÄúSofia, can you go ahead and escort Dr. Ricketts to the primary exit?‚Äù Dr. Ricketts stood tense next to him. I lazily nodded my head, daydreaming about the ecstasy of my own bed as opposed to the unceremonious excuse for a cot I dwelt on here in the prison during longer shifts.

As we walked through the corridors, Dr. Ricketts bounced up and down, his glee barely contained. ‚ÄúYou realize you just witnessed history, right?‚Äù

I smiled weakly. ‚ÄúGlad I could be a part of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe revolutionized everything, the whole way our society works. This is Nobel Prize worthy, you know. Did you ever think you‚Äôd see that Monster act like a real human?‚Äù He said with gritted teeth, making sure to emphasize ‚ÄòMonster.‚Äô

‚ÄúI honestly can‚Äôt say I thought I would.‚Äù Part of me just wanted to humor Ricketts, desperate to get to my Corolla and on the road to my daughter, Abby. But another part of me was genuinely curious about what the hell I had been a part of. The monitoring, the preparation, and the candidate selection had taken up the last two months of my life, and I still didn‚Äôt know what was happening. ‚ÄúWhat was that exactly?‚Äù I blurted out before I could stop myself.

Ricketts looked less pleased than before. ‚ÄúWell, obviously, you lack the clearance to delve deep into the subject, but what you saw last night was the first human extraction of what you would qualify as ‚Äòevil.‚Äô All of us have bad thoughts, violent thoughts, evil thoughts. But we can control it, let it simmer below its boiling point. These people,‚Äù He cleared his throat, glancing around the hallway before dropping his tone an octave, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre different than us. Maybe they're weaker, or maybe there‚Äôs just more evil in them, but they can‚Äôt control it. So we have simply eliminated it.‚Äù

I stared forward down the hallway, nodding my head slowly.

‚ÄúSounds like it might put me out of a job,‚Äù I chuckled, glancing back towards Ricketts, who still seemed unamused.¬†

We walked in silence the rest of the way, each of us checking out of the facility. I offered a simple wave to Ricketts as I started for my car. He smiled.

‚ÄúSofia, right?‚Äù I nodded as he continued. ‚ÄúMonitor O‚ÄôBryon and if nothing goes awry, as I expect it won‚Äôt, the next time we meet, is when we are shooting a spot for the news, ok?‚Äù

I gave him a thumbs-up with a smile as I saw him skip off towards his distant car.

I lived about 30 minutes away from the facility, an hour outside the city. I collapsed in my bed, waking up just in time to catch my Abby returning home from school.¬†

‚ÄúMom, my cocoon hatched!‚Äù She exclaimed. Whipping out her phone and showing off pictures of her orange butterfly.¬†

‚ÄúWow, honey, that‚Äôs amazing,‚Äù I replied, embracing Abby in a hug in one hand while scrolling through the pictures of her butterfly in the other.¬†

It was a Friday, and I had planned to take her to the amusement park for the weekend when I got the first distressing message.

*Sofia,*¬†it read,¬†*report to the facility immediately. This is a mandatory report.*¬†

I had never gotten a message like this from work before.¬†

I called up my sister, Stacy. Stacy had been taking care of Abby for the past few days while I was on one of my marathon shifts at the facility.¬†

Stacy was a saint. She agreed to take Abby, and I scooped up my disappointed daughter in a full-bear hug before telling her we were going back to Aunt Stacy‚Äôs for a little bit.¬†

She was quiet on the car ride over. Aunt Stacy‚Äôs such a common place she slept, we didn‚Äôt even need to pack a bag for her, half her wardrobe and belongings were strewn across Stacy‚Äôs guest bedroom.

‚ÄúSo they can just call you in at any time, even when you took the weekend off?‚Äù Stacy‚Äôs tone struck a chord between sympathy and annoyance.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never happened before, but I guess there‚Äôs a first for everything,‚Äù I sighed, leaning up against my sister‚Äôs front porch. I pulled out the tickets from my purse. ‚ÄúLook, these were supposed to be a surprise for the weekend, two all-day passes.‚Äù¬†

Stacy shook her head before embracing me in a hug.

‚ÄúThey better be paying you triple!‚Äù she whispered in my ear.

When I got back to the facility, the parking lot was mostly empty. I buzzed in, going through security, meeting a frantic Jessica.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not letting us leave. All of them jerks, bad guys!‚Äù Jessica cried.¬†

It‚Äôs horseshit,‚Äù Aguero concurred, Jessica shooting him a glare.¬†

I saw the administrator appear over Aguero‚Äôs shoulder, straightening to attention. ‚ÄúI know you all are disappointed with the board‚Äôs decision, but they want this project to be perfect. You five are the only ones cleared to monitor our patient, O‚ÄôBryon, so make yourselves comfortable for the next seven days.‚Äù

The administrator stopped my protest before I could even start. ‚ÄúYour families have been notified, along with extended families who have taken on the burden left by your absence,‚Äù he extended an arm towards me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll all take solace that your compensation will be much greater than usual.‚Äù He turned heel and exited the room before we could badger him with any more questions.

‚ÄúWhat an asshole,‚Äù I muttered, causing Kelly to smirk and Jessica to audibly gasp.¬†

‚ÄúWell, you heard the boss,‚Äù Sebastian replied. Sebastian had been the guard to wheel in the mangled rabbit cart. ‚ÄúSofia and I can take the first shift, if the rest of you want some shut-eye,‚Äù he looked over at me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you got some sleep at home?‚Äù I nodded meekly.

O‚ÄôBryon sat on the screen mumbling to himself. The camera quality was substantially better than our normal set-up. He was smiling, his eyes seeming to sparkle.¬†

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been doing this all day,‚Äù Sebastian mumbled. ""He seems fine to me.""

I nodded, ‚ÄúHas he interacted with any of the other inmates?‚Äù  
Sebastian shook his head, ‚ÄúNot from what I‚Äôve seen.‚Äù

We sat there for the next few hours. The inmates ate dinner and started to return to their cells. Two nameless guards were walking O‚ÄôBryon towards a personal cell that he had inhabited for the past month when the phone in front of Sebastian rang.

Sebastian answered.

‚ÄúYes---Ahh, ok sir‚Ä¶.Immediately?--Ok, I‚Äôll let them know.‚Äù He pressed a button in front of us and put the microphone to his mouth.

‚ÄúThe patient can return to his normal living quarters.‚Äù The two guards looked up to the camera and nodded, doubling back and leading O‚ÄôBryon back to his original cell. Sebastian hit the table in front of me twice to get my attention. ‚ÄúSofia, can you monitor the audio? You should be able to hear them now,‚Äù He claimed, pressing another button and handing me a pair of headphones.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre back?‚Äù a straggly voice exclaimed.¬†

‚ÄúOh, Jeremiah, it is good to see you again!‚Äù O‚ÄôBryon said cheerfully.¬†

‚ÄúGet your hands off of me! What the hell are you doing?‚Äù I was about to warn Sebastian of the incident when he finished flicking a few switches, and O‚ÄôBryon‚Äôs cell suddenly popped up on one of our monitors.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a hug, Jeremiah, I hope we can start anew.‚Äù

‚ÄúGet the fuck off me, freak!‚Äù Jeremiah shoved O‚ÄôBryon back.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Jeremiah. I should have known better.‚Äù O‚ÄôBryon replied remorsefully, plopping down on the bottom bunk.

‚ÄúTop bunk.‚Äù Jeremiah threatened. O‚ÄôBryon nodded and climbed up to the top.¬†

‚ÄúDid it lobotomize him? He‚Äôs a pushover now.‚Äù Sebastian wondered aloud, now sporting headphones of his own. I shrugged in agreement.¬†

‚ÄúWhy are you like this?‚Äù O‚ÄôBryon asked down towards Jeremiah as the two took their places in the bunk bed.¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you ask?‚Äù Jeremiah looked up, puzzled.¬†

‚ÄúWhy are you so angry all the time?‚Äù O‚ÄôBryon‚Äôs eyes looked sad.

‚ÄúThis is some sort of weird ass-test?‚Äù Jeremiah wore a look of concern, almost cowering, looking up at the former ‚ÄòMad Doctor.‚Äô

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to help, get to know the real you. Why are you here, Jeremiah?‚Äù Jeremiah looked up suspiciously.¬†

‚ÄúI was set up, they said I killed my wife, but I wasn‚Äôt anywhere near that bitch‚Äôs house.‚Äù Jeremiah turned his body and looked at the wall. ‚ÄúYou know, you‚Äôre one to ask, you know they call you the ‚ÄòMad Doctor‚Äô, don‚Äôt ya?‚Äù

O‚ÄôBryon closed his eyes and sighed. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt fix the past, but we can turn a new leaf, can‚Äôt we, Jeremiah?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt shut up, up there, I swear to god I‚Äôll fucking choke you out, old man.‚Äù

I reached for the phone, ready to warn the guards of Jeremiah‚Äôs expected violent outbursts, but Sebastian stopped me.¬†

‚ÄúRemember, Jessica had to implant the patient‚Äôs cellmate with the probes,‚Äù he motioned to another button, ‚Äúhe lays a finger on O‚ÄôBryon and we‚Äôre gonna shock him halfway to death.‚Äù

I nodded slowly. Sebastian took a lot more pride in our work than I did and took everything a lot more seriously than I had the last few weeks. The peculiar nature of the situation made me regret merely going through the motions.¬†

The two kept talking. O‚ÄôBryon would try to pry deeper into Jeremiah‚Äôs personal life while Jeremiah would shout back vague threats and insults. I felt a tap on my shoulder as Kelly took my shift.

It felt like hours before I finally drifted off to sleep. My sleeping chamber was pitch-black. I don‚Äôt know if it was still night or finally morning when I felt Jessica rousing me awake, light from the hallway pouring into my quarters.¬†

‚ÄúWas that too rough?‚Äù She worried as she grasped both of her shoulders.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù I said a little grouchy, still fighting off the last bastions of sleep.¬†

‚ÄúOh my bad. It‚Äôs your turn on shift, but if you want to catch a few more Zzzzs, I can go a little longer.‚Äù¬†

I scowled at her, confident that she was being sarcastic. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fine, alright, I‚Äôll be up in a sec.‚Äù

I marched into the control room, greeted by sunlight. Sebastian, Kelly, and Aguero all sat around the monitors sipping coffee.¬†

‚ÄúMade you a cup.‚Äù Kelly held up a styrofoam offering. I accepted it, brushing out the sleepiness from my eyes.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù I inquired, forcing a yawn to retreat, pointing towards the central screen. O‚ÄôBryon, a permanent recluse in the dining hall, seemed to be leading a gaggle of four men at a table, Jeremiah sitting next to him.¬†

‚ÄúJeremiah finally opened up to the old man. Heard he‚Äôs taken him to the Prisoner‚Äôs Prom,‚Äù Sebastian laughed.¬†

The whole day in the yard, at meals, when they were just sitting around, Jeremiah and O‚ÄôBryon seemed attached at the hip. They exchanged stories, told jokes, O‚ÄôBryon‚Äôs staying G while Jeremiah‚Äôs jokes ventured deep into R-rated territory, and expressed remorse that they hadn‚Äôt been friendlier sooner.¬†

It went on this way for two more days. Each hour watching the newly reformed O‚ÄôBryon made me more and more of a believer in the ANGEL treatment. Sure, Ricketts may have seemed a bit crazy with a serious God-complex, but here before my eyes, I saw a man, famous for disfigurement and murder, now seriously seem like he wouldn‚Äôt hurt a fly.¬†

It was around noon when the first incident happened.

O'Bryon led Jeremiah to a small patch of grass in the mostly dirt-filled prison yard.

""Are you ready for this next step?"" O'Bryon asked, our control center was able to pick up every sound and sight in the facility. Jeremiah gave a half-hearted nod before lowering to his knees.

All five of us were in the control room. Most of us had slowly lost interest in the project, counting down the days of the week until we were finally granted our freedom. Jessica had taken more of an interest in O'Bryon and Jeremiah's budding friendship and called for our attention as Jeremiah slowly got to his knees.

""I know they're both in prison and haven't seen a woman in a while, but he's not gonna-"" Kelly stopped when Jessica shot him a dirty look.

Jeremiah looked nervous. He got back to his feet and gave O'Bryon a small push back.

""I don't know about this, man. Let's just go back to normal, ok?""

O'Bryon's face fell. For a moment, he looked genuinely heartbroken, like a father watching his son reject salvation. He placed a limp hand on Jeremiah's shoulder.

""Ok, Jeremiah. It's ok.""

Then his fingers dug in.

O'Bryon's arm snapped around Jeremiah's throat with inhuman speed, the chokehold so tight I could see Jeremiah's face already darkening on the monitor. ""But there's evil in you, son. So much evil."" His voice was gentle, almost loving, even as Jeremiah's feet kicked desperately against the dirt.

""What the fuck‚Äî"" Kelly started, but the words died in his throat.

O'Bryon's free hand clamped over Jeremiah's jaw, fingers forcing their way between his lips. Jeremiah's scream came out muffled and wet as O'Bryon pried his mouth open like he was cracking a shell. I could see Jeremiah's teeth cutting into O'Bryon's fingers, blood mixing with saliva, but O'Bryon didn't even flinch.

""I'm saving you,"" O'Bryon whispered, pulling Jeremiah closer, almost tender. ""I'm saving you, son.""

Then his jaw unhinged.

The joints popped with sounds our audio picked up all too clearly. His throat convulsed, once, twice, and then it came.

The black goo erupted from O'Bryon's mouth in a thick, pulsating torrent. It forced its way into Jeremiah's mouth like it was alive, like it had purpose. Jeremiah's eyes went wide with pure animal terror, his body convulsing as the substance flooded down his throat. He tried to bite down, tried to turn his head, but O'Bryon held him fast, their mouths pressed together in an obscene mockery of intimacy.

Jeremiah's screams turned to choking gurgles. His hands clawed at O'Bryon's face, drawing blood, but O'Bryon just stroked his hair with his free hand like he was comforting a frightened child.

The black goo overflowed from the corners of Jeremiah's mouth, running down his chin, his neck, soaking into his orange jumpsuit. His throat worked frantically, forced to swallow, drowning in it.

""Jesus Christ,"" Aguero breathed beside me. ""Jesus fucking Christ.""

I couldn't move. None of us could. We just watched as Jeremiah's struggles grew weaker, his kicks becoming twitches. The black substance seemed to pulse with its own heartbeat as it transferred from one body to another, and I swore I could see it moving beneath Jeremiah's skin, spreading through his veins like ink in water.

O'Bryon finally pulled away. The disconnect made a wet, sucking sound that made my stomach lurch. Jeremiah collapsed to his knees, black ooze pouring from his mouth and nose, his whole body heaving as he vomited more of it onto the grass. His hands clutched at his throat, at his chest, fingers scrabbling like he was trying to claw the substance back out.

O'Bryon knelt beside him, gathering him into his arms. Jeremiah was crying now, animal sounds of anguish and terror, his face a mask of black slime, tears, and blood.

""I know it hurts,"" O'Bryon murmured, rocking him gently. ""I know. But the evil is leaving you now. Can you feel it? All that anger, all that hate‚Äîit's washing away.""

And that's when I saw O'Bryon's face.

He was smiling. Beatific. Like a saint in a painting. His eyes were wet with tears of joy as he cradled the convulsing, choking man in his arms.

""You're going to be so good now,"" O'Bryon whispered, pressing a kiss to Jeremiah's forehead, leaving a black smear across his skin. ""So, so good.""

Sebastian grabbed the phone with shaking hands. ""We got a breach, patient‚Äî"" his voice cracked, ""‚Äîpatient is expelling additional waste onto another prisoner. It's‚ÄîJesus Christ, it's going in him, it's‚Äî""

The phone slipped from his fingers and clattered to the desk.

On the monitor, Jeremiah had stopped fighting. His body went rigid, back arching, and then he began to seize. His limbs jerked in violent, unnatural angles. His eyes rolled back until only the yellowed whites showed.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dying,‚Äù Aguero said breathlessly.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so,‚Äù Jessica whispered in awe, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs being reborn.‚Äù

Kelly grabbed her shoulder. ""Jess, what the fuck‚Äî""

""Don't you see?"" She turned to us, and her eyes were bright, feverish. ""It's beautiful. He's being saved.""

Sebastian lunged for the shock controls, but before his hand reached the button, something changed.

Jeremiah's seizure stopped.

His body went completely still.

Other inmates had noticed. They were gathering around O'Bryon and Jeremiah, a slow circle forming. I counted six, then eight, then ten men, all watching with expressions I couldn't read from this distance.

They all collectively held their breaths.

Then Jeremiah sat up.

His movements were smooth now, controlled. He wiped the black residue from his mouth with an almost delicate gesture and looked down at his hands like he was seeing them for the first time. O'Bryon helped him to his feet, still smiling that terrible, gentle smile.

Jeremiah turned slowly to face the security camera. Even through the grainy footage, I could see it: his face had changed. The permanent scowl, the hard set of his jaw, the violence that had lived behind his eyes for years gone in a flash.¬†

He smiled. It was soft, serene, and utterly wrong on his face.

""Sofia."" Sebastian's voice sounded like it was coming from underwater. ""Sofia, go.""

I couldn't feel my legs. Couldn't feel anything except the ice spreading through my chest as I watched Jeremiah, the man who'd threatened to choke O'Bryon just a few days ago, wrap his arms around the former ‚ÄòMad Doctor‚Äô in an embrace.

""Sofia!"" Sebastian's shout snapped me back. He was pointing at the monitor with a trembling finger. ""Go,"" Sebastian said again, his voice breaking. ""Go let the administrator know we have a code N-6-P. Go, Sofia. Run.""

I ran.

Shortened dialogue scenes with Baker and Fabien in Big cleaning and Prospero's Kiss,"So when I met up with newly embraced Baker at the back of Niko's pawnshop, I said about about one thing and then suddenly I was back in the shop area with an objective to report back to Ryong. I could then allege that Lou would be safe from IAO for some reason.

Later, when looking for Safia at the coffee shop and sitting at her usual table, Fabien started and conversation. Then that immediately ended and I had to speak to Mrs Thorn.

Is this happening to anyone else? Is there a way to avoid it, besides learning how the game is scripted and how to make a patch?",1,1761521466.0,vtmb,0,1.0,False
1ogzb06,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ogzb06,Android Health integration issues?,"I track my hikes with Alltrails, I have a subscription, I like the app very much. It used to feed the hike info through Android Health to my Fit app and that would update my step count, all very straightforward.

Now, today I went on my first hike with Oura.

I did everything as usual - I tracked my hike with Alltrails, when it ended, I saw the hike in my Fit app and also an activity was tracked in my Oura app that I confirmed (had to adjust the time by 30 minutes, which is slightly disappointing) and all seemed to work great. And then all the data between the apps started syncing and I think it caused a malfunction across the board.

Where I first saw we everything tracked fine I now see:
- in Oura there's no activity at all, but the step count is accurate to account for that 3h hike
- in my Fit app I see an activity that corresponds to my hike, but the step count is zero, it used to always have the Alltrails logo on it, so that I knew it came from that app
- the total step count in Fit was jumping up and down all day and has now settled to what I would expect with the account of that hike

I also have another supermarket run that Oura tracked as an activity, but oh well, those supermarkets are huge, I'll take whatever activity I can get.

This post is more of a rant, because I pretty much know what the advice can be - track activity manually as it's the most accurate way, stop the integration between these two, because they clearly compete with each other on what gets tracked, but honestly, I like my ecosystem seamless and for 350 euro + the subscription cost I'd expect a bit more seemless integration between the core apps then this.

Between the incompetent activity tracking and the useless food AI I'm really contemplating requesting the money return for this thing and get myself a pixel watch or something. I don't really see the benefits, as I so happen to be sleeping perfectly and I've read time and time again on this forum that this is a sleep tracker first and foremost, so I'm probably not the target audience.

1ogz6mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_cheetoh_breath/comments/1ogz6mr/a_shadow_of_a_memory/,A. Shadow. Of. A. Memory,"For the longest time, I've always tried to put some sort of diagnosis to my mother. I've never really been able to pinpoint what to call it. The word I use most is delusional. The second way I describe her is self-centered. Even from my earliest memories she wasn't really around. I have more memories of all of my grandparents and my dad's sister . Both sets of my grandparents I feel like they took me in turns.
I was born in Ruston, Louisiana while my mom was attending LaTech. 
No one really wanted her to go through the pregnancy. I'm not really sure what made her keep me. I have never felt a connection with her as far back as I remember.
All of her children were excellent leverage to being a leach. I think she was studying computer science at the time. Of course I have no recollection of this time but this retelling is a retelling of bits and pieces I've heard. My dad was a year younger still attending high school. They were young and dumb and obviously full of cum. I was born in February so that would put me being conceived the summer before my mother left for college and my dad entering his senior year. I've seen the inscriptions in the yearbooks. And gag. It was a high-school romance, we'll leave it there. My dad finished his senior year, had a blast in Florida on spring break. My dad's sister has said that my great grandfather is the only reason any of the family came up to see little baby me.
Somewhere in there they had a wedding that I was at.  My mom had me calling other dudes dad while my dad was off at boot camp for the military police. I do remember seeing letters somewhere along the line. I'm pretty sure reading between the lines that they were on and off and my oldest younger brother came along when I was two. I'm pretty sure he was something of a makeup baby. Probably a better way to come about than a whoopsie daisy baby. Again they were on and off again as far as i can tell.  My dad for the longest time HATED crying. Like would be furious if I cried for most of my life. Someone told me it's because my mom used it as a manipulation. I could see it.
I remember my dad having a couple of girlfriends. One ran him over with his three wheeler. I remember the hospital and him having a cast up to his hip. I don't recall anything about where we were living or much of my mother being around.
My middle sister was born when I was five‚Ä¶ the day after my birthday. My parents are still a sometimes I guess, but this kid comes out and apparently everyone could tell it was another man's. I'm not really sure how it all goes down but my mom, myself, my brother, and this new sister end up living with this other dude. Keith.
It was time for kindergarten. I don't remember anyone bringing me. I do remember the first day pretty vividly.  I'm sitting at my group table and this kid Casey is throwing down, screaming and crying, will not let his mom leave. It's probably the earliest memory I can recall without a prompt. I remember sitting there and very distinctively thinking ""he knows something I don't. Something bad is about to go down."" But really Mrs Miller was fine. I did get a paddling for biting a girl that year. We were having an activity day and the girl in front of me got out of line. Then she wanted to jump back in. I was like no way.. go to the back. She started pushing me and I bit her. Why was I the only one to get into trouble? I don't know. But I was a pretty shy kid. Like hide behind my grandma if people spoke to me in public. It was the worst punishment.  Mrs Miller left the door open. The teacher from across the hall had to come out and witness, so her door was wide open as well. And this lady paddled me for standing up for myself. My little tear stained face had to go back and face that whole classroom after. But you know what‚Ä¶ karma always comes back around. That same little pushy girl stapled her fingers together. So I feel like retribution was paid.
Living with this new dude, Keith, was really shitty though. He was into drugs and woman beating. Which is so strange. He was such a short man. I guess I understand why they say that little men have small dog syndrome.  So small and so much rage. My mom was at least a head taller. I remember taking the three of us kids to the back room of the trailer while they fought and he slapped her around. It wasn't always fighting though.  There was a girl that lived on this little compound that was about my age. Becky. Her and I were pals. The autoparts store down the road had this coin operated horse that we really wanted to go ride one day. Keith tossed us the keys. So I made a plan. Becky was going to operate the pedals I was going to steer. We were going.  We didn't take the drive way.  We just took off across the field in the truck. They did catch up to us. I don't think we got beat for that.. but as you'll find my memories are muddy. I don't have very many childhood memories. Or even adolescent memories to be honest. I should be studied at my ability to block things out and move through trauma.
Keith had a daughter that was older than me. She tried to tell me Santa wasn't real. Keith's mom used to give me coffee. Mrs Nita was a really nice lady.  Not that I remember much about her. Just a short wrinkly lady that had gravel in her voice. We only lived there a short time. Although I do remember that's where my dad first brought his new girlfriend back from California. I had my first experience with death out there too. We had this white dog named Daisy that loved chasing cars on the highway. I got off the bus in the rain and her heart was still pumping there on the ground.  My mom was crying. I just thought it was weird that she was at the bus stop. I usually had to hike my ass down that long gravel driveway. I also used to always get my ass tore up for peeing outside. I just didn't think it was fair by brother could literally pee anywhere. But dumb on my part.. I could've for more discreet places that the middle of the driveway. 
Well he didn't really bring her, she kind of just showed up. He had been working in Cali and that job ended and he came home. The way they met is funny. It was at a bar, she must have been shit canned because she mistook my dad for Doug Stone. My dad looks absolutely nothing like Doug Stone by the way. But they had their little fling and a tubal pregnancy along the way. Which poor little baby but it probably saved me from worse treatment at her hand.
I don't remember where we lived after that, but I remember switching schools for first grade and I always got off the bus at my dad's parents. My Mamaw Pat would always have vanilla ice cream for me with pecans and some caramel sauce while we watched jeopardy. There were always lots of snacks. Still are to this day. I've never felt more safe and loved than being around my grandparents.  That goes for my mom's parents as well, I spent a lot of time with them too. Maybe that's why I've always gotten along better with older people and I don't really understand people my own age. My dad's sister and grandma did a lot with my class in first grade. They would bring these cups with treats and chocolate suckers. I didn't really like them or the attention but I like that it felt like they cared enough to do for me. First grade was from what I remember a peaceful time. I don't really recall my mom from this time. I was an avid bed wetter and even pissed my pants in class. One particular instance I remember having to go so bad and the teacher said I could wait. Well, I couldn't. It just happened. I can still see the wall of pee just spreading out across the whole floor and everyone looking at me. And cleaning it up ugh. So embarrassing. I'm pretty sure we went on a field trip to the Tabasco factory that year. We made t-shirts with sponge printed crawfish on it. I also sneeze farted in a group project once. This kid yelled and pointed. Oh man. It's hysterical now. But man did I deny with my whole little life. I was criss cross applesauce in a group. The sneeze came out of nowhere. And that toot echoed off the tile floor. I also bruised my two front teeth in class. I was running and hit my mouth on a desk. They turned gray. The dentist said I would be lucky if my permanent teeth came back normal. I will say that I have been pretty lucky in life. My teeth are actually naturally pretty. I'm not vain about much but I'm so thankful for my smile. There was a girl that told me hotdogs came from dead men's weiner. It was dumb, I didn't eat hotdogs for quite a while.  I still think about it at my 36 years.  
My brother and I used to hide when it was time for our mom to get us. We would cry and not want to leave with her. 
There was a bully in first grade that would kick the bathroom door open while we were in the stalls. I had an older cousin in fifth grade that took up for me. It's funny to think back on her flipping that little brat off. My cousin did tease me in front of her friends about our other cousin always wanting to ""play boyfriend and girlfriend with me."" That was really weird but I was just going along with it.  I'm pretty sure it started shit in the family. That aunt had always had an issue with me. I stopped being invited to things and they weren't allowed to come to my things. It did hurt my feelings at the time because I didn't know what I had did wrong.
Second grade at yet another school. We were living in a trailer park and by this time my brother was in kindergarten. We would walk to school. And we had a lady that kept us after school. She would give my little sister cough medicine to sleep. She had an older son that would show me his little weiner across the room.  I only thought it looked like a little worm. 
My mom was not a clean person whatsoever. We would have mountains of dirty laundry. Roaches everywhere. Never had clean dishes. She would lock us out of the house to roam the neighborhood while she was fucking the neighbor's husband. Mind you she was friends with this woman. We played with their bad ass kids all of the time. Spend the nights.  I recall being in the top bunk and the boy that was like a year older than me for into my bed. He wanted me to touch his dingaling and wanted to touch me. 
Eventually my mom and Jimmy must have been caught because we ended up moving half way through that school year to my grandparents old house. Jimmy was a meth head. My mom's mom would talk about how they had to redo the linoleum from him freebasing. I was surprised she knew what that meant to be honest. He was another abusive guy. His kids were fucking terrible. They talked my little brother into eating dog treats. He says they weren't that bad. I got in trouble for my teeth falling out before dinner. I lost all four front ones at once. The two top and the two bottom. Jimmy also picked my brother up by the belt loop and was yelling in his face. I was so enraged I kicked him in the shin and told him to put my brother down. That's really it of character for me.  I feel like most of my life I've tried to become smaller and stay out of the way.
I used to get really bad nose bleeds. This one particular instance my mom was freaking out and I was filling up a hand towel.  She couldn't get it to stop. I remember my dad coming over and he was able to get my nose to stop bleeding. 
All of my memories aren't necessarily traumatic.  While we lived in that house my brother, sister, and I would catch things in jars and think we were saving ""helpless"" little animals.  I hid behind the couch and tried to sneak and watch movies like Chucky. I liked playing with roly polies. There was a kid across the street kind of catty corner that would play in this canal with us. He told us he had found a bag of toes. The lady that kept us in that neighborhood was really nice. I think she had two girls around my age. I used to wear a lot of these matching bike short sets.  It was probably like grandma's. There was a lime green pair trimmed with lace and the shirt was green and white straps with lace.  Around that time we had visited my mom's parents and we would ride the lawn mower for fun. My grandma had made me dress up clothes one item was this long black skirt. My brother was driving the lawn mower and I was standing on the blade cover. I lept off but the skirt was hung up so I was being dragged. I remember trying to yell at my brother to just stand up and it would've killed the engine but he kept trying to stay seated but his legs weren't long enough to reach the pedal. My poor plump pawpaw running across the field. Bless him.
My dad and his now ex wife got custody of me in the second half of second grade.  My mother was neglectful to say the least. But she's also self entitled and trifling. She was trying to get child support for my middle sister. One problem with this was she wasn't my dad's. I do think that was a facilitator to my dad going for custody. If she hadn't filed, would I have been left with her my entire upbringing? Anyway. My sister was born while my parents were legally married so she had my dad's last name. My dad and his then wife went to Keith and it sounds like they both kind of went after my mom for custody. My dad threatened to take her as well if they didn't get her name changed. I remember the day dad and Kelly came to get us. My mom wasn't sad or upset.  She simply said, that's ok I have another one on the way. I didn't see her for years after that. I was seven maybe eight years old.
Living with my dad was much more stable.  My brother and I still wet the bed for a while. But it was so much less volatile. And for a while I was cared for. My dad had my brother and I propose to Kelly. They said they did that so that my cousins (the ones that I had been estranged from) could come to my little mermaid birthday. I don't think I had actual friends for the majority of my life. I still have a hard time feeling connected or of consequence to people.
The weird thing about one of those cousins,  she always wanted to play boyfriend/ girlfriend is what she called it. Like wanting to always hold me and snuggle me. She told me once that her dad had been sleeping and touched her. I guess I was just the lucky recipient of her abuse. I told my parents and wasn't allowed over there. And that aunt has never liked me since.
The birthday was magical though.  I don't think a bigger fuss has ever been made for me. They decorated the entire living room with blue cellophane and had green streamers as seaweed and balloons as bubbles. Dad had made me a cut out that you could put your face through to be Ariel and Flounder. 
The next few years were probably the most normal of my childhood. My brother and I shared a room for a little.  We wrote on the bunkbeds that my dad built. I remember sanding it off and it felt like an eternity. I fell off the top bunk once and I remember just grunting and going back to sleep. My dad came in and put me back where I belonged.  I remember wanting shishkabobs so bad but when it came to them getting made amd I was too sick to eat them and how I was so disappointed. My dad hung up a swing in that yard in the tree but had fallen out of the tree into the bed of his truck.  That was the same time frame as hurricane Andrew. The lights had gone out and we had a McDonald's picnic in the living room.  I made a friend with the neighbor girl and the night I was supposed to spend the night I snuck home in the middle of the night because I was so scared to pee the bed.  I didn't tell anyone that I had gone home so everyone panicked.  Dad put up a pool in the backyard and we would have virgin daiquiris. My brother was scared of the boogie monster so dad and his then wife put apples under our beds.  They told us if the apples were still there in the morning that we were safe.  I snuck and took a bite of my brother's. I think that was probably one of those moments as a parent you have to fuss at your kid but I think it was probably one of my more amusing moments. Things were pretty stable for a while there.
We moved in fourth grade but I never switched schools or moved again after that. I was always a lover. The friends I had were by accident. They just started sitting by me and hanging around me.  I did have a boy. Friend.  Joseph Martin. He was probably the first friend that I really made. Somehow.  Because I sure didn't go out of my way to meet people.  He fixed my fallen bra strap once and the two girls that did hang around me started calling him my boyfriend.  I remember it being super uncomfortable because I never wanted to have one of those.  Seeing my mom in and out with guys ruined a lot of things for me. I think he moved away after the fifth grade.  My brother had started cub scouts. My dad and Kelly <the step mom from Cali> were den leaders. The little boys would stick their hands under my bedroom door.  But I really liked the activities.  Camping was fun. The stacks of popcorn in the living room smelled like heaven. The year I did as a brownie was boring.  I didn't have any interest in girl scouts. But the things I got to do with the cub scouts were fun. There was this really down lady that I remember just being the coolest lady.  She had winged liner and looking back probably smelled like patchouli or sandalwood. I thought her name was the coolest. Sheeba. 
I also saved a girl in fifth grade.  She started choking on a sunflower seed. I did the heimlich maneuver. She was one of the girls that just kind of adopted me.
Does every kid want to change their name? I really wanted like a dude name.  Or I wanted it to be Ivy. The name my mom was going to give me, hold on to your panties because it's a doozie‚Ä¶. Diospyros Virginiana. And if that's not shitty enough.. since it's the scientific name for a common persimmon tree, she wanted to call me Percy for short. 
I danced for a bit at the fanciest dance academy in our rink a dink town. It was fun until it wasn't. I'm not competitive and it started feeling like it was all about who your parents were. The girls weren't nice. But I never have felt like I fit in anywhere. I didn't really cultivate my friend group until late high-school and into college. Even high-school I felt out of place.

It‚Äôs been a minute since I‚Äôve paid close attention to the markets, so I‚Äôm not going to pretend like I have enough of a feel for what happened to make a quippy remark, except to say that it‚Äôs more than a little disheartening to see the PSEi back to trading with a 5-handle on my first day back at my desk. Spin it however you want (people selling down to buy the MYNLD IPO?), this is not a sign that things are going well for the market.

>  **PH:**  We start the week with the **Maynilad** [MYNLD 15.00] IPO offer period already underway. The offer closes on Wednesday, which is the same day that 8990 Holdings [HOUSE suspended] delists. Lightning crashes, a new mother cries (that‚Äôs a musical reference for all my early 90s comrades out there). 

>  **International:**  Fed rate decision on Friday!

>    - ***MB:*** Feels like the MYNLD IPO is taking up all the oxygen in the room right now. What little ‚Äúmarket‚Äù I followed while I was on leave basically reduced down to socmed speculation that significant downward moves in some blue chip stocks and recent darlings were really just traders gathering dry powder (freeing up capital) to invest in the MYNLD IPO. Whether that‚Äôs true or not remains to be seen. Brokers want us (retail buyers) to think that the smart money (the institutional buyers) can‚Äôt get enough of this trade, but my anecdotal experience says that retail traders just aren‚Äôt all that rabid for the deal. Is the smart money right? Is the retail interest actually more intense than my personal experience would suggest? We‚Äôre about to find out. One thing to remember about smart money is that it doesn‚Äôt always share the same incentives as we do. And it makes bad bets, too. Just remember all the cash that GSIS and SSS threw into those disastrous ALLDY and HOME IPOs. You just do what is right for you.

>- **[NEWS]  Maynilad exercises full ‚Äúupsize‚Äù option...** **Maynilad** [MYNLD 15.00] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=129cf126c0fc6a83ec6e1601ccee8f59)] has exercised the full upsize option for its initial public offering, following strong investor demand that was reportedly nearly twice oversubscribed at the institutional level. MYNLD said it would offer an additional 354.7 million common shares ahead of the close of its IPO offer period on October 29. The move is expected to raise an extra ‚Ç±5.3 billion, bringing total proceeds from the share sale‚Äîpriced at ‚Ç±15 per share‚Äîto as much as ‚Ç±34.33 billion for Metro Manila‚Äôs West Zone water concessionaire. President and CEO Ramoncito Fernandez said, ‚Äúthe decision to exercise the upsize option in full reflects the market‚Äôs confidence that Maynilad is a company with strong financial fundamentals and is primed for long-term growth.‚Äù MYNLD is set to list on November 7, marking the country‚Äôs largest (and last) IPO of 2025.

>  **Unofficial Twitter Poll:**  I asked Twitter if it was interested in buying the MYNLD IPO, and the results were 39% ‚Äúyes‚Äù and 61% ‚Äúno‚Äù. This is by no means scientific, and there‚Äôs a just a metric buttload of potential sampling issues, not the least of which being my implied distaste for this IPO as evidenced by the act of just asking the question. But I think it does demonstrate that this isn‚Äôt the kind of no-brainer populist knockout that we saw with MerryMart and its ilk back in the day. 

>    - ***MB:*** The price drop implies a ~7% yield at the new IPO price, which is pretty good. But that kind of return isn‚Äôt all that rare. Yeah, there‚Äôs interesting upside, because this isn‚Äôt a REIT or a bond, but instead a massive water concessionaire monopoly with a fairly unique capex cycle, and that‚Äôs the ‚Äúfun‚Äù of this IPO. Which of the views will end up being the more accurate assessment of value? The REIT/dividend play view, or the ‚Äúexecution risk‚Äù view so eloquently discussed by **Jet Mojica** in his MB Friends article ([link](https://mailchi.mp/merkadobarkada/mb-friends-scc-dividends-run-on-cash-not-earnings)) from earlier this month? The value/price part of this puzzle is by far the most important, but context matters. Rates are stale and falling. Our market kind of sucks, but it‚Äôs actually an exception to the global tide. Economies around the world are faltering. The US is just closing its eyes and taking its hands off the wheel. We can‚Äôt seem to keep our own politicians from shooting us in the foot. Again, you just do what is right for you! There are no easy easy ways here to make money. There are no sure things.

>- **[NEWS]  Basic Energy partners with ACMobility on EV charging station plan...** **Basic Energy** [BSC 0.14 ‚ñº13.5%; 295% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=7264c31c07a5762bec6e1601ccee8f59)] has partnered with **ACMobility**, the Ayala Group‚Äôs mobility platform, to install and operate electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in select retail locations. In a disclosure on 22 October 2025, BSC said its wholly owned subsidiary, **Basic Energy Renewable Corp.**, signed a deal with ACMobility to deploy EV charging facilities at Total stations along the South Luzon Expressway (SLEX) Northbound in Sta. Rosa, Laguna and along the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) in Apalit, Pampanga, as well as at Ecooil EDSA in Mandaluyong. BSC said the pilot site will ‚Äúserve as a model for future installations across the country,‚Äù adding that drivers can use the ‚ÄúEvro‚Äù app to locate, monitor and pay for their charging sessions. BSC chief executive Oscar de Venecia Jr. said the partnership signifies the company‚Äôs ‚Äústrong commitment to advancing clean energy and sustainable transport.‚Äù
>    - ***MB:*** It feels like we‚Äôve been waiting for BSC to do something forever. Things have been happening (backdoor, renewable energy, etc), but nothing has been moving the needle on the stock‚Äôs price, which has been in steady decline since the 2020 basura stock craze that pushed BSC up to ‚Ç±1.86/share. The stock has been stuck in this ‚Ç±0.12 to ‚Ç±0.16 range for over a year and a half, and while this news has certainly given bagholders some excitement to sell into, it‚Äôs only shaved about the last year of the decline off the price. That‚Äôs not nothing, but to someone who saw BSC‚Äôs board and bought the COVID hype, it won‚Äôt be enough. This stock feels like it‚Äôs under a ton of selling pressure. Always. Will this news finally absorb that overhang, or is it just another blip on BSC‚Äôs long march lower?

>- **[NEWS]  Coal Asia has ‚ÄúNO INTENTION TO DELIST‚Äù...** **Coal Asia** [COAL 0.02 unch; 27% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=1fc01d80ae70e7f8ec6e1601ccee8f59)] said it has no plans to delist from the **Philippine Stock Exchange** despite launching a ‚Ç±99.7-million tender offer to buy out the remaining shares held by minority investors. In a disclosure on 22 October 2025, COAL said that ‚Äúcurrent shareholders will sell the shares necessary to comply with the MPO (minimum public ownership)‚Äù should the transaction result in a breach of the threshold. Last September, COAL announced that a group of major shareholders‚Äî **Dexter Tiu, Eric Peter Roxas, Gertim Chuahiong, Alexander Tiu**, and **John Capinpin**‚Äîhad entered into a share purchase agreement with **Pure Energy Holdings Corp.**, its subsidiary Pure Water Corp., and Quadwater Corp. for the sale of 28.67 billion common shares, representing 71.68% of the company‚Äôs outstanding capital. The transaction triggered a mandatory tender offer to buy out the remaining 11.33 billion public shares at ‚Ç±0.0088 apiece‚Äîmore than 60% below market price. Market observers have said Pure Energy, which shares several directors with COAL, may be positioning for a backdoor listing.
>    - ***MB:*** Sorry for the capslock screaming in the headline, just thought it would be fun to give you a taste of how COAL decided to deliver the entirety of its response to the exchange. That‚Äôs funny. I‚Äôm interested to see where this process goes, but like the ABG backdoor play (where ABG requested a self-imposed suspension), the main issue here is the lack of clarity for investors and speculators. We know who will be buying the shares through the tender offer, but we don‚Äôt know who will exercise control. I mean, we have an idea, but we don‚Äôt know. We know the companies that could use this translation as a backdoor play for listing on the PSE, but we don‚Äôt know which (if any) of Pure Energy or Pure Water or Quatwater will own a majority of COAL‚Äôs shares post-backdoor, should that backdoor happen. Beyond that, even if we did know, we don‚Äôt have any idea about the potential owner/s‚Äô intentions. The tender offer was at a massive discount to market, and the best clue we have as to what this is that COAL code-named this valuation exercise ‚ÄúProject Neptune‚Äù. Of course, Neptune is the Roman god of freshwater and the sea, so that makes me think of water. Perhaps this is a bulk water play. But Neptune was also the Roman god of horses. Oh, but the file was also confusing titled ‚ÄúProject Poseidon‚Äù, who was the Greek god of the sea! What does this mean? Was Project Poseidon an earlier name that was scrapped because it doesn‚Äôt reflect the freshwater narrative? Hard to say. Poseidon was also a god of horses, so maybe we‚Äôre being hit with a double-barrel of misdirection to take our eyes off the real play, which is some massive consolidation of, like, horses. It‚Äôs at this point in my morning that I realized I have had too much coffee and not enough food.

This can be done in 1 day with a vehicle and finish the day at Amanohashidate or Ine. Then travel 2.5 hours back to Osaka.

**SEASONAL/ EVENTS**

[**Wakakusayama Burning**](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4118.html)

We literally burn the side of Mt. Wakakusa on the 4th Saturday of January every year. It‚Äôs an old tradition to mark early spring in Nara. If you‚Äôre here that weekend, go see it.¬†

[**Mitarai Gorge („Åø„Åü„Çâ„ÅÑÊ∏ìË∞∑)**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LYTxF5nMkHYzcMDx8)  
Clear water, bridges, waterfalls. Stay in Tenkawa if you can. If you have a car, you can spend the night and slow down in the mountains. There are inns and campgrounds like Tenkawaminozumi Auto Camping Ground.¬†Amazing find!

[**Akame 48 Waterfalls**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5J3a9ECqCxLufmPp6)

Waterfall trail through the forest. Expect around 3 to 4 hours total walking. I‚Äôm making my own guide for this, but for now you can use this one:

[**Naramachi Historic District**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XHAMvhAY1LDxmnwh7)  
Wooden townhouses, little shops. Good place to walk around.

# HYOGO AREA (day trips from Osaka / Kyoto)

This is where it gets really underrated.

**Tamba Sasayama**

This city basically still looks like Edo period Japan. It wasn‚Äôt a military or factory target, so it wasn‚Äôt heavily bombed in World War II. It also avoided big war damage in earlier periods. The castle town layout is still there. Samurai streets and merchant houses are still standing. Remarkable place!

1ogyxzg,https://i.redd.it/a8ea2wdngjxf1.jpeg,is starbucks using AI art? screenshot taken from the official starbucks app,"can't tell if this is AI generated or just drawn by someone who doesn't know what a starbucks looks like. starbucks got caught using an AI photograph for some signage a few months ago, so i'm suspicious. some weird things i noticed, for people who aren't familiar with starbucks layouts:

1. there are 2 different sets of brewers pictured here on the back counter, our old brewers (left side) that make one large batch of coffee, and the new Vertica brewers (right side) that make single cups on demand. no stores would have both of these. 

2. there are espresso hoppers attached to the register (the box looking things next to the barista with brown hair). these would never be attached to anything but an espresso machine.

3. a plastic organizer that holds cups for us to grab is behind the espresso hoppers, completely out of reach of baristas. 

4. mocha drizzle bottle next to the Vertica brewer. wouldn't be there for any reason irl and would normally live with the blenders. there is also a whipped cream canister next to the regular brewer that also probably wouldn't be there

5. baristas are out of dress code. all starbucks employees must be wearing a black shirt, and this art was made well after that dress code change went into effect 

two things about the art itself that makes me suspect AI is certain things in the image lacking dimension or just not looking right (the cup holder on the back counter makes no sense, it looks like the cups are just thrown in there), things in the image not making sense (one of the cupboards on the back counter appears to be an oven in a spot where it makes zero sense to be, and also a style of oven that we've never had), and just the general art style is suspicious to me now. but i can't find any definitive flaws that scream AI and couldn't just be excused as an artist who isn't knowledgeable about starbucks layouts. my thought is maybe an AI generated image that an artist added onto/drew over. what are your thoughts?

It gets frustrating when conversations dry up and fade, but I‚Äôm trying my luck here again. How can I find something real and genuine for the long term if I don‚Äôt keep trying even if here on reddit, right? 

I‚Äôm interested in something genuine and long-term, not rushing into anything. 

About You 

- 37 - 40+ (not younger!)
- Single (no situations where I‚Äôd end up as ‚Äúthe other woman‚Äù)
- Patient, genuinely kind, and cares about humanity
- Creative (not necessarily an artist) or at least appreciates all forms of art
- Hygienic in all aspects (body, belongings, and living space)
- Curious and enjoys learning; ideally someone who reads and comfortable with both deep conversations and light, silly ones (balance lang)

About Me

- üìç 39F, based in Rizal
- Single, never married, no kid
- Height: 5‚Äô4
- Hygienic
- Morena, currently with braces - on the curvier side (77kg) ( a bit sedentary but actively working on it) 
- 9-5 WFH girly
- Hobbies: Reading, creative hobbies, exploring ideas
- A bit of an introvert
- Liberal (if it matters to you what I stand for politically!) 
- I‚Äôm loyal, affectionate and likes to cuddle.
- A coffee date (weekends) would be a nice start, just to see how conversations flow in person. 

If this resonates with you, send a DM. Please introduce yourself and share something interesting about you. It could be a hobby, a quirky fact, or even what you‚Äôre reading right now.
