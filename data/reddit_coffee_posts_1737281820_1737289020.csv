1i4x5yb,https://i.redd.it/a3capabpzxde1.jpeg,Natural Cleaning Win: Coffee Stain Gone! ‚òï‚ú®,"
Hi community! üå±

This morning, I faced a classic challenge‚Äîspilling coffee on my carpet. Instead of panicking, I turned to a simple, natural solution, and it worked wonders! üí°See my before and after photo!!

Here‚Äôs what I did:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Blotted the spill immediately with a clean, dry cloth (no rubbing!).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Mixed warm water with a splash of vinegar and a tiny drop of dish soap.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Gently dabbed the mixture onto the stain using a sponge.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Rinsed with clean water and blotted again until dry.

For additional tips, I came across this fantastic article:¬†[How to Clean Coffee from Carpet](https://www.proluxcleaning.co.uk/how-to-clean-coffee-from-carpet). It‚Äôs a lifesaver for anyone who loves coffee but not the stains!

Now my carpet looks spotless again, and I‚Äôm so relieved. Simple solutions really are the best. üåü

Do you have any natural cleaning hacks to share? I‚Äôd love to hear your ideas! üòä",0,1737288850.0,CleaningTips,0,0.5,False
1i4x5u5,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1i4x5u5/feeling_hopeless/,Feeling hopeless,"I could use a bit of advice, I (21M) have always troubled with a fucked up self image. I‚Äôm not the tallest person at 5ft 5in (165cm) and being the shortest in every place I go took a big toll. About the weight, I used to be 70kg (155 pounds) and always told I was fat and obese. Life happend and I got to 112kg (246 pounds).
I have been forced to try many fad diets, many trends and many ‚Äútricks‚Äù (put butter in your coffee and turmeric to lose 10kg in a month) and none worked.
I had taken up a lot of energy expensive activities for a while (long walks, sailing) and more or less passively dropped to 103kg (227 pounds)
Over the past few weeks I took up counting calories seriously and adding walks. I have gotten down to 99kg (218) since I started a month ago. It just seems so slow.. I dread getting up on the scale because I don‚Äôt feel any lighter, walking is still very difficult and a bit painful after 1-2km. My plan is down to 75kg(165 pounds)at least, maybe 65kg (143 pounds).
I have started an active job on a tour boat so that keeps me active 3-4 days a week. Trying to get into diving as well. Besides walking there is nothing as an activity to do right now.. no gyms close to home (less than an hour by bus), the only one is a 20min walk but it‚Äôs over my price range. Biking is out because I don‚Äôt have one, or the budget.. and swimming will soon be an option (10-12 min walk to the beach but water is still 16¬∞c).

From my past seeing the scale never change makes me dread the weekly weight in, which should be tomorrow. It feels crippling, I know I will feel demolished if I get on the scale and nothing changes after putting in genuine effort. What advices are there? What could I do?

1i4x5i6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i4x5i6/aita_for_getting_upset_about_my_provider_husband/,AITA for getting upset about my provider husband keeping score of who offers more value in our relationship?,"My (27F) husband (32M) and I have been together for 2 years now and he‚Äôs been fully providing for me since we met. I haven‚Äôt worked at all nor does he want me to. We have a more traditional relationship where he makes a LOT of money so he provides and I cook, clean, take care of him, etc. No kids or pets.

I live an extremely easy life and will admit that first thing, and he‚Äôs also very good to me and very patient with me. However, over the last 6 months I fell into a very deep depression. This is most likely due to the medication I was taking and the severe lack of food I‚Äôve been intaking which heavily affects hormones. After I got off of said medication, I still felt extremely depressed and constantly CONSTANTLY questioned our relationship and nitpicked my husband in my head 24/7. We got into fights where we both said nasty things to each other and the things he‚Äôs said stuck with me. 

During this time, I barely did anything at all around the house. I did just enough so that the house wasn‚Äôt messy but was still dirty ‚Äî floors not vacuumed for weeks, dishes piled up for days, beard hairs all over the sinks and counters, etc. I also barely cooked. I would meal prep 30 meals for him for a few weeks and then in between these times he would end up having to DoorDash for a week straight. Inconsistency is my middle name here. Sexual intimacy was lacking as well, he would sometimes go 5+ days without me taking care of his needs so-to-speak. I was moody and checked out. Spent most days on the couch scrolling TikTok. He works from home on his computer so we are home together 24/7 and don‚Äôt leave the house much. 

As of today, I‚Äôve been doing amazingly for about 2 weeks. Not a long time, but I feel like myself again and have been very consistent: house is clean, 3 meals a day and sometimes dessert, I bring him coffee first thing in the morning, I make sure he ‚Äúgets off‚Äù at least twice a day, I go to Pilates to stay in shape and I am rather fit, I always stay ‚Äúpretty‚Äù: shaved, perfumed, hair done, nails and toes done, lashes on and lingerie on around the house, etc. 
He was very patient with me during the rough time but recently when I asked money for my regularly scheduled hair appointment (I‚Äôm black and hair is expensive) he said he‚Äôs still questioning if I‚Äôve done enough to deserve it. I have some money in savings, about $10k, but this is not liquid as I have it invested. We have joint accounts but I always ask before large expenses. I don‚Äôt ask for a lot and it‚Äôs my only big expense so I‚Äôm shocked at him telling me I need to ‚Äúearn‚Äù it. The appointment is booked same time every month and he knows when my hair grows out for longer then that, I look ghetto.

I feel like it‚Äôs because he watches too much Andrew Tate because sometimes he‚Äôll randomly get extra strict like this. That being said, I think he‚Äôs totally right. He told me that, for example, if he was to not provide for me for 6 months, I wouldn‚Äôt have tolerated it the way he tolerated my depressive episode. He‚Äôs 100% correct. That really put it into perspective for me and I feel awful about it. But his harsh words are really bothering me now and it feels weird to keep score in a relationship, but he said keeping score is one of the most important things to do in a traditional relationship otherwise I‚Äôll keep slipping up. He said because he is the man of the household that I shouldn‚Äôt be debating this topic either so he stops listening when I try to talk about it. Am I spoiled and overreacting? AITA???

TL;DR: I was lazy for 6 months around the house but now I‚Äôm a perfect wife again yet now my provider husband is withholding funds from me until I earn them.",1,1737288801.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False
1i4x3lq,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i4x3lq/undiagnosed_rant/,undiagnosed rant,"I'm now planning to get checked by a professional because I do not know what is happening actually and what is this called. I don't claim I have a schizophrenia or any mental disorder, but I extremely believe, there is something happening to me.

(I'm not seeking validation, and I don't know if this is the right sub, and excuse for my grammar)

I've been, for a long time, hunted by voices in my head and experiencing extreme paranoia.

I think it's now needed a special attention because it is driving me every day crazy.

I am hunted every day.

To tell some of my scenarios, I'll start with my experience today.

1.) Just this morning, I stopped by a restaurant because I craved for some fries, I skipped breakfast, so I wanted to buy a bucket of fries (my favorite).

As usual, I got in the line and then when it was already my turn, the cashier asked me if it was for dine in or take out and my order.

""Take out, please. One bucket French fries"" while getting money from my bag

""Burger""

""No, only fries"" (I said, and I thought she was suggesting the meal burger with fries)

""Okay, burger""

""Fries only."" I said with irritated voice and pointed my finger in the fries in menu

(The woman looked confused, but everything was not sinking with me yet, the cashier wasn't speaking and just actually listening to my order to record it, but I interpreted it like it was her speaking. This is hunting me now, as I'm imagining her uneasy face reaction)

""I'd also like a spaghetti... with a coke drink"" looking up on the menu

Cashier: with Burger?

""Coke! Drink!"" I clarified. I think I almost shouted because people began looking at me

""Yes, right, coke drink"" and then looked to me like she was assured she was getting my order correct.

And then that moment I realized the ""burger"" suggestion is from the woman voice in my head. My anxiety raised up and then I started having paranoid thoughts that I was being mean to the cashier so now I will be punished.

I heard again other voices when the food was being served already

""They put c\*m on your food"" \*whisper voice

""They spaT oN yoUur FooOd"" \* tease voice

which are the usual voices I hear every time I order outside home, I always hear these voices to the moment I already get used to it but this woman's voice suggesting a fucking burger is different, it's almost like it was the cashier talking and I also realized the cashier was just listening to me repeating my order. In other people's p.o.v, I was being a rude customer. It was appalling that I saw crews murmuring to each other and looking at me like there was something wrong before I got out of that place.

2.) Again, this afternoon, I went to a convenience store because I wanted to have a brewed coffee, I used a self-serving station which has the coffee machine. While waiting for my cup to be filled by the machine I turned back and tried to look for some chips (the machine runs for like 10 seconds before pouring stuffs)

\*A person walks in front of the coffee machine

""He put a poison pill in your cup!""

My soul left my body for a second and hurried back to my cup. I was really scared and paranoid so I sneakily throwed the cup into the trash and got a new cup and then did not put my eyes away on the cup ever again until it was ready.

(I will clarify to you all that in these moments, I am not aware the voices are not real because I am being drive by my emotion)

3.) There was a time where I hear teasing voices intensely, the man's voice was full of teasing of how much dumb I am and explaining I should be ashamed of myself and die. I usually don't pay attention to these voices or maybe I just got used to it.

It was so intense that I just unintentionally shouted inside our classroom.

""No!"" and then hit my desk.

suddenly, everyone is looking at me, fortunately I have managed to get through it because I pretended making a mistake while using my laptop.

If you look up the ""day in a life of schizophrenic person"" in red app (I video I stumbled upon when I was researching the things that are happening to me), that's exactly what's happening to me. I am not schizophrenic or anything because I am not yet diagnosed by a professional, but I believe I am high likely having a severe mental disorder right here.

Many will probably argue, that ""If I'm aware with it, then I'll probably don't have it""

I will answer with all my heart that I'm being tortured everyday by these crazy things, and some people needs to experience it firsthand to actually decipher mental disorder isn't just a linear thing and it is occurring to each person differently.

That's all for now, folks. I have so many stories left besides these voices, like how I was so scared thinking someone is spying at me, ambush stab me every time I open the door, and the time I didn't eat for days and locked myself in my room because I was thinking they are putting poisons in my food or feeding me human m\*\*t.

After listening to Andrew Huberman and Peter Attia, here‚Äôs the general guideline they suggest: Cardio: A couple of hours a week. Resistance training: 2-3x a week. HIIT: ~30 minutes a week.

My View: Cardio: Based on the CDC, 75-150 minutes of cardio is more than enough to get most of the cognitive benefits from exercise. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily involve jogging or running, Type 2 cardio, like fast walking, is sufficient for optimal results.

Resistance Training: The benefits of resistance training are mostly related to boosting testosterone, IGF-1, and increasing BDNF. For testosterone, low and high levels seem to be the most problematic. A study shows that having moderate testosterone levels is the most beneficial for fluid intelligence, while high testosterone is known to reduce spatial and non-verbal intelligence. Increasing IGF-1 is beneficial for kids below the age of 10 but isn‚Äôt particularly helpful for adults. As for BDNF, most of it is produced during cardio. Meditation and even drinking coffee can also increase BDNF.

HIIT: There‚Äôs no unique benefit HIIT provides that cardio doesn‚Äôt, except when it comes to improving VO2 max. However, VO2 max is already highly correlated with resting heart rate, and training specifically for it won‚Äôt make you any better at cognitive tests.

Exercise offers several benefits, such as hippocampal neurogenesis, BDNF boost, and increased neuroplasticity, which are mostly achieved through 75-150 minutes of Type 2 cardio (fast walking) which most of us get indirectly through daily activities.

Resistance training can be useful later in life (near retirement) to prevent sarcopenia or osteoporosis, but beyond that, it‚Äôs not very beneficial, especially not HIIT.",0,1737288337.0,PeterAttia,1,0.33,False

Are people with standing desks more productive? This question has floated around offices and coworking spaces for a while now, often sparking hot debates among employees and managers alike. Some swear by their standing desks, claiming they‚Äôre the holy grail of productivity, while others think they‚Äôre just a fancy way to stand around and pretend to work. In this article, I‚Äôll share my own journey with standing desks and dive into the scientific studies, anecdotal evidence, and personal experiences to see if those who stand while they work genuinely get more done. Let‚Äôs see if we can finally settle this standing desk dilemma!
  
  
## The Rise of the Standing Desk Culture

It‚Äôs amazing how a simple piece of furniture can ignite a mini-revolution in workplace culture. I remember the first time I stumbled across a standing desk. It was at a friend's office, and let me tell you, it looked like some kind of fancy spaceship control panel‚Äîcolorful, sleek, and very much unlike my sad, creaky old desk that had seen better days (and countless spilled coffees). There it was, boldly proclaiming, ""You can work while standing!"" Talk about a game-changer. My curiosity transformed into a nearly romantic idea of signing a contract with this standing desk, vowing never to crouch over my cluttered desk again like an ancient troll guarding its treasure.

The rise of the standing desk culture didn‚Äôt just appear out of thin air. As we‚Äôve gotten more bloated by our sedentary ways (thanks, Netflix), health experts and wellness warriors began sounding the alarm. They pointed fingers at our seated lifestyles, warning us about all sorts of nasty stuff‚Äîback pain, weight gain, and even that dreaded ‚Äúdesk job slump‚Äù where productivity takes a nosedive. Consequently, workplaces began catering to our modern human needs by swapping out traditional desks for those that allowed for a little more movement. Suddenly, flexibility became the new norm, promoting wellness alongside productivity.

So, are people with standing desks truly more productive? Studies have shown mixed results, but what‚Äôs clear is that the trend is here to stay, reshaping office environments into spaces focused on both health and output. And who knows? Maybe one day, standing desks will just be called ‚Äúdesks.‚Äù

## Health Benefits: The Good Side of Standing

Since I started using a standing desk, I‚Äôve noticed a few changes in my body that I never thought were possible. Gone are the days when I felt like a rusty robot after sitting for hours. Honestly, my back used to ache like I‚Äôd carried a mountain on my shoulders. It's like my body finally got the memo: standing is the new sitting! 

Read more: <https://tedsadvice.com/are-people-with-standing-desks-more-productive> 

Scientific research backs this up too. A study published in the journal _HUMAN Factors_ found that standing desks can reduce back pain by over 30%. That's a serious statistic right there! It‚Äôs not just about comfort; it‚Äôs about health. With better posture comes fewer muscle strains, and let me tell you, I‚Äôm all for that! 

I can feel the difference, and my posture‚Äôs improved‚Äîno more slouching like a sad little turtle. Surprisingly, I‚Äôve noticed that standing while I work helps keep my weight in check too. When you‚Äôre on your feet, you tend to move a bit more, and that little bit adds up. A study from the American Journal of Preventive Medicine even highlighted that people using standing desks tend to burn more calories throughout the day. 

So, are standing desks really a trend? For me, it‚Äôs more like a little slice of health heaven. Have any of you felt the same benefits? I'd love to hear your stories!

## The Real Productivity Question

Have you ever wondered if standing really cranks up your productivity? I sure have! When I first switched to a standing desk, I had high hopes. I imagined myself whizzing through tasks like Superman zooming through the sky. But instead, I felt a little like a baby giraffe learning to stand. Wobbly and a bit uncertain!

Some studies suggest that standing desks can boost productivity. They say folks who stand tend to be more engaged, and some even multitask better. **One notable study** showed that employees who used standing desks reported a 10% increase in productivity compared to their seated counterparts. Sounds awesome, right? But here‚Äôs where it gets tricky. 

For me, standing felt less like a superpower and more like a super distraction! I found my mind wandering‚Äîoh look, a dust bunny!‚Äîand my focus took a nosedive. I had energy, sure, but I was like a squirrel on espresso. Also, standing for long stretches? My legs began to feel like overcooked spaghetti! So, while my buddy Karen thrived in her standing fortress, I was left wrestling with my productivity, doing more pacing than creating.

It seems the answer isn‚Äôt so black and white. Like trying to decide between chocolate and vanilla, it really depends on the person. What‚Äôs your take on this standing desk saga?

## The Potential Downsides of Standing All Day

Standing desks might seem like the shiny new toy at the office, but let me tell you, there‚Äôs a hidden side to this trend that‚Äôs not all rainbows and productivity gains. Ever stood for hours, feeling like a dancing flamingo trying to balance on one leg? Yeah, that was me last Tuesday. By the end of my marathon standing session, my legs were screaming louder than a toddler denied dessert.

You‚Äôd think standing all day would energize you. But nope! I was met with fatigue that wrapped around my legs like a boa constrictor. As I stretched out my cramping calves during a meeting (very professional, I know), I realized that standing desks can inadvertently promote discomfort and soreness. My misadventures taught me one crucial lesson: balance is key. It‚Äôs about weaving in those breaks, not turning the office into a standing-up-only zone.

If you‚Äôre thinking of committing to the standing desk lifestyle, consider these tips to spare yourself the chronic foot pain trap I dived headfirst into:

* Alternate between sitting and standing throughout the day.
* Use supportive shoes; this isn‚Äôt a fashion show!
* Keep a footrest nearby to shift your weight now and then.
* Take breaks‚Äîstretch those legs. They‚Äôll thank you later!

Even the most productive of us need a little TLC for our feet. 

## Finding the Perfect Balance

Finding the right balance between sitting and standing at work can feel like trying to balance a spoon on your nose‚Äîawkward and a bit wobbly! I had my love affair with my beloved chair, especially during those late afternoon slumps when I could regress into the soft embrace of the seat and pretend I was thinking deep thoughts. Spoiler alert: I was mostly dreaming about snacks. However, I knew I needed to shake things up. After all, staring at a screen all day can turn anyone into a pretzel-shaped human.

So, I began attempting a more flexible routine. At first, I set a timer to remind myself to switch positions! Those little nudges felt like gentle pats on the back‚Äîexcept for when I forgot to turn that pesky timer off. Don‚Äôt ask how many times I jolted myself into a standing position mid-email. Trust me, it‚Äôs not the most graceful sight! I found that blending a hybrid setup worked wonders; sometimes I‚Äôd pop my laptop on a kitchen counter, other times I‚Äôd pace while on a call, which made me feel like I was starring in my own motivational movie.

Listening to my body became essential. I learned that if my legs started feeling like rubber bands, it was a clear sign for a break. No shame in a quick walk or stretch‚Äîlife‚Äôs too short for stiff muscles! Adopting this balanced approach has not only helped my productivity, but I also feel less like a sleepy couch potato. So, let‚Äôs move a little, shall we?

## Personal Preferences: The Boss of Productivity

When it comes to productivity, personal preferences reign supreme, much like how some people can‚Äôt function without coffee while others swear by green tea. I‚Äôve always believed that the secret sauce for getting stuff done lies in what makes you feel most comfortable. 

Read more: <https://tedsadvice.com/are-people-with-standing-desks-more-productive> 

Take my office, for example. We've got a mix of standing desks that buzz with energy and those cushy chairs that practically hug you like a friend. There‚Äôs Gary, my desk buddy, who stands like he‚Äôs conducting an orchestra while typing away. He cranks out reports with the zeal of a caffeinated squirrel! Meanwhile, Joan, on the other end, has a chair that looks like a throne. She sinks into it, often declaring it her ""productivity cocoon."" Honestly, the first time I saw her do this, I half expected her to sprout wings and take flight. 

What I've learned from all this desk drama is that it's no one-size-fits-all situation. **For some, a standing desk sparks creativity and dynamism. Others find solace‚Äîand effectiveness‚Äîin a soft, cushy chair, possibly with a cup of hot cocoa nearby.** It‚Äôs all about trial and error. I‚Äôve fiddled with different setups, and while standing desks are great on some days, I find that nothing beats the comfort of my well-worn chair on others. 

So, remember to listen to your body and thoughts. Explore your work environment, and don‚Äôt be afraid to switch things up. After all, you might just discover your own little productivity hack!

## Conclusions
  
  
So, are people with standing desks more productive? The evidence seems to suggest that, yes, they can be, but with some big ‚Äòbuts.‚Äô It‚Äôs not just about the desk height; it‚Äôs about how we use them and our personal preferences. There's a balance to be struck between standing and sitting, and it varies from person to person. By experimenting with our working positions and listening to our bodies, we can create an environment that boosts our productivity. In the end, it might just come down to what makes you feel good while you work. After all, happy workers tend to be the most productive ones!",1,1737288041.0,EverythingErgonomic,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm sorry if this breaks the rules but this crossed my mind recently and i‚Äôve honestly been at a loss and need some advice. :( My mom is my legal guardian and is the only legal guardian in the household. I‚Äôm the second youngest of my six  siblings. Six of which that are constantly at work and hog the household keys. I‚Äôll get into ‚Äúhogging the keys‚Äù in a minute because it is a key part of this story. 


I guess the first question is like to start off with is if staying in a small room for 20 days straight is normal. I know it sounds bizarre but that has honestly been my reality for months now. I‚Äôm rarely granted the chance to leave my house and whenever i am able to it‚Äôs either for menial errands or whatever boring thing my mom wants me to do. I call it boring because it‚Äôs either going to the store or  to a random relatives house (trust me, it‚Äôs not as fun as you‚Äôd think.) I would just sit on the couch, almost lifeless and tired as she talks to her relative and chatters. That‚Äôs it 


that has legitimately been my reality (like i‚Äôve said before) for years. We never do any fun activities. It‚Äôs just errands ‚Äî> back to my personal jailed hell. I don‚Äôt remember the last time i‚Äôve  ever went out and about and laughed, had fun, did something, just anything. I‚Äôm swear to god i‚Äôm not lying. 

She‚Äôs always gone. And because the other residents got the keys, i‚Äôm legimateky inable to leave my house. (Because there is nobody able to lock the door.) Let get into my room. It‚Äôs a small twin bed with a. small window and a closet. It‚Äôs a really small room. 23 hours a day im laying on my bed. I barely eat.


This has led me to garner really bad vision. I went from near perfect eyesight to pretty bad eyesight. I cannot read anything clearly maybe a hand away from my face.


This isolation has left me with zero friends. I‚Äôve lived like this for about 6-ish years now. I‚Äôve never went to prom. I‚Äôve never been enrolled into any fun activities as a child. When i scroll through insta stories and see people going to coffee shops, hanging out in carnivals, or just going to a museum, i want to cry. I wonder what it‚Äôs like. I‚Äôve never done anything a normal teenager would have. I have told her my feelings and i do believe that she does understand a bit but she‚Äôs glued to her phone a like moth to a flame. 

Im so hungry. All of the time. I don‚Äôt remember the last time i‚Äôve eaten breakfast, or dinner. Last night I ate a small bowl of mash potatoes. That‚Äôs all for the entire day. My depression and fatigue just gets really bad and i stay in my bed when there are days where there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a ton of options: like If there is it‚Äôs just menial fruit and bunch of condiments that don‚Äôt go together. I watch a lot of mukbang videos alone and stuff because i just crave a full meal sometimes (i kinda feel myself getting emotional typing this.) But it‚Äôs true.. 

I‚Äôve told her how i‚Äôve felt, even broken down and cried about wanting to end it all but the next day, she just acts normal and whenever i‚Äôm crying in my pillow ‚Äî i hear her and my other siblings in the kitchen laughing and having fun and i feel like an outsider ailen who‚Äôs crazy.

Sometimes when i get really sleepy i wonder if she‚Äôs even aware that her daughter has been in her room for almost a month  straight 

I miss being young especially before the pandemic because even though i‚Äôd stay home usually for 2 weeks straight, i‚Äôd have the ability for her to take me to the park and sometimes i could interact with the other kids there and i could fell the sun and touch the grass and play for an entire day and it was just so beautiful. I feel so pathetic because i feel like that‚Äôs a basic human right but it‚Äôs so foreign to me at this point 

I am aware that i am a legal adult and hopefully i will be able to own a car and go out finally and do things that i‚Äôd like, but staying in my jail for so long ( aka my small ass room lol) i kind of lost my perception of time and stuff, since i spend a lot of time in here. It‚Äôs really hard. I think to myself: i am a legal adult.. so i can‚Äôt be neglected by a parent right..? It‚Äôs not like a kid anymore. But i feel like that‚Äôs a wrong way to think. I am basically locked in here. 

I also feel like she‚Äôs normalized it somehow And tries to ignore the issue at hand. Her nineteen year old daughter literally spends months in her room, never leaving her dark home. It just makes me feel sick. She makes me take prenatal pills just so i can get the nutrition that could be just substituted by driving me places and spending time with me! 
Like prenatal pills? Wtf?? 

What really tipped the cake for me was when my uncle, who lives the a small  apartment with us full time, said he hasn‚Äôt seen me in months. What. the. fuck. It just made me feel so invisible.

I developed a strong connection with a coworker (different departments - little to no interaction)which included some romantic encounters (no sex). However, she expressed concerns about the coworker dynamic and a mutual friend (who apparently was also interested in me - but has subsequently started dating someone else), stating she couldn't pursue a relationship. 

Despite this, she continued to initiate contact (I do as well) sending mixed signals, which is causing some confusion.  Over the last few weeks six weeks or so we have gone out for coffee, she came to my place for a tea (3 hours) and we went to see a movie. Each time I respected her stated boundaries - ended each visit with a hug. 

I'm struggling to understand her feelings and whether to pursue the connection, oscillating between stepping back and being proactive.

I just need to have a conversation, but I have no idea how to approach it. Sort of don't want to come off as a complete fool for even thinking she was ok moving forward. 

Let me know how I can clarify.

I am so happy to find this community,  I read through lot posts here, thank you all for sharing. 

I would like to share my story of bipolar2 and maybe to hear your opinions/experience as I was recently diagnosed
The story: 36M, had mood swings since my 20: roughly 6 months positive, 6 months depressed, was thinking it's okay and was not paying much attention to this, was nothing crazy, the biggest struggle was depressive episodes rather than 'positive' which that time I couldn't call 'hypomania' as I don't think I was doing something crazy.

Last year I was looking for psychotherapist/psychiatrist (online) to improve my mental wellbeing and also there was a specific topic to talk through. 
After a few sessions he suggested that I might be bipolar2 and also that I have addictions (I was drinking alcohol since my 15, party lifestyle, smoked weed here and there but just a little and then around 24-25 y.o. started smoking weed daily, then other substances such as mdma, and since 2019 cocaine, ketamine regularl..

So that therapist sent me to his collegue who specialized in addictions and we started working together: he also diagnosed bipolar2 but also said that my problems could be due to the regular substance usage and since Nov 23' I stopped alcohol/drugs and he put me first on Lamotrigine (we started with 25mg and went up to 150mg long term)

So I was in talk therapy (CBT a bit) with him since Nov 23'. I started therapy with him as I knew that soon my depression will kick in so I thought I will win know as I will start my therapy first (first time in my life)
But then depressive episode seriously kicked in a month and evolved through the next months (therapist saw my highs and then lows). He was suggesting to start Fluoxetine but I pushed back as I never had experience with SSRI and was afraid and couldn't believe I have BP2 and thought I will overcome depression through CBT (still can't fully accept it). During Q1 2024 I was taking Lamotrigine but I never felt any better, but the depression was getting worse, was cryin, feeling completely lonely, couldn't talk with people, social anxiety ( I work from home and these days don't have many friends which is also a struggle for me as I moved to the current city 5.5years ago and first years I was just partying here and I met lots of party people which I was meeting through out the night and we never made closer connections)

So the depression was getting really worse so I made the right decision to start Fluoxetine 20mg end of March 24', the weather was getting better(winters are extremely gray here), meds seems like started working, I was getting better and better. Before Fluoxetine I was drinking wine and did just 2-3 times drugs within 5 months which was an achievement for me.
Since Fluoxetine I cut off everything 100% and closer to summer I started feeling better and was allowing myself a glass wine at the weekend (not 1 or 2 bottles which was before), I was really feeling better and better and I was so thankful to Fluoxetine. 
As I was thinking that I am recovered from depression (still couldn't accept BP2) I stopped Lamotrigine/Fluoxetine mid-july 24' as I was going for holidays in the beginning of August and I knew I would be drinking wine (I am wine person in general), eat amazing food so I would need to stop SSRI as they are not working well with booze and I couldn't think of any other type of vacation as drinking wine, going to nice bars, etc.
I already was feeling good high, to me this is was 'notmal me' - happy, positive, confident, high communicstive

So in my vacation I did drink wine, did drugs 2 times, felt in love with amazing lady (didn't work in the end). When I got back home I was feeling full of energy, motivated, self confident, positive, funny, high energy, nothing crazy - to me this feels like normal me and that's how people and friends know me and love me. 
Then on my return home I never got back to my meds as I felt fully recovered and started allowing myself more wine, more drugs again,not comparable to what I was doing in the past, mostly Ketamine, but still. I was thinking that I'm controlling the usage and was happy getting high as I was diving in my world, dreams, feelings, etc.

Btw in the end May I started actively working back again on my business project (building a jewelry brand) which I kicked in right before my depressive episode in nov-dec 23' (when I was hypomanic)
Hired art-director to build a brand, made 2 more designs, made and order to produce 60 rings, the process is still ongoing and I am waiting to get all this finalized tin the next 2-3 weeks
I consider this active  phase as hypomania as I was very active and positive, was taking ketamine for the creative process to build up the brand concept, naming, travelled a lot, met lots of people, was confident and spoke loudly that in April 2025 I will sell all my 60 rings and my company will be extremley successful. I was so confident about this and I believe if not the current depressive episode I would really achieve this

people were saying that I need to calculate risks but I was so confident. I consider this as hypomania

So now, in the beginning of December 24' some thing went the other way I expected (the lady didn't come to the city which we planned) and it affected and made me a little upset(plans were changed, this made me unstable as I was already in highs before this an probably my brain was tired). To smoothen that 'bad' mood up I went to the bar a few times with cocaine and then a few days after I wake up feeling that something is going down inside me... So through the month of December 24' I got into my depression, anxiety was getting so strong, it was getting really bad, and then during my visit to my family on Xmas holiday I really felt off with my depression which Im facing now. Feeling low, can't talk much to people, super silent, only bad thoughts running through my head, no anxiety anymore (I use 12.5mg Hydroxyzine situationally)

Now I started again with Lamotrigine 25mg and Fluoxetine 20mg and will be increasing Lamotrigine by 25mg every 2 weeks and will keep Fluoxetine 20mg as it helped me last year to get over the depression. But dunno when to stop it as normally they say you need at least 6 months but last year I stopped it after 3.5 months and I was good! Or maybe hypomania 

This time I am confident that I won't touch substances, but not fully confident about the wine, especially waiting for summer to come here. And it appeared that I was an addict and yet don't know how to entertain myself without wine/drugs. Still figuring out but the most important for me to get over my current depression, never touch substances and possibly wine, to continue constantly Lamotrigine and stop Fluoxetine as soon As I will be confident that depression is gone. 

In general I realized that substances were a massive part of my life and now I'm not sure what to do and with whom to hang during my free time.
In general I had(!) lots of friends and people loved me. Or maybe I thiught I have as For the last 10 years I spent lots of time alone at home, walking alone, going for coffee alone, galleries and so on. I went to bars alone, I went vacations alone (though to places where I have friends so was not alone ) but still going almost everywhere alone

The other problem I have that I'm not confident with dating ladies and sex specifically, though I can say I look nice, have good job.
The longest relations I had was 3-4 months and 36 years. So maybe all problems above also affected by this

As my main wish right now to find a lady and get into that world that I missed a lot and I think this is what I really need in my life. But when in depression I can't  do nothing, when I was hypomanic - I was partying and since not confident with ladies, was just ignoring that and partying

1i4wma9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1i4wma9/please_help_my_brother/,Please help my brother,"My brother is 23M and has seizures. Yesterday he had 4 in a row and I can't bear to watch him suffer, so this is my last resort. I'm no expert on this, so I'm not sure what is relevant, but I can mention some things. The seizures started about 4 years ago, in his senior year of high school. He went to many parties and got really drunk. Drank lots, and came home barfing. He must have tanked his liver, and since then, every couple of weeks to couple of months he has had seizures. They are usually during the night, after he falls asleep. I know when he has one, because I sleep in the room next to him, and hear a distinct scream. I rush to get my mother to help and make sure he doesn't choke on his saliva or fall of the bed. His muscles stiffen, he convulses. He has two phases so to speak. First one is convulsions and frothing saliva out of his mouth. In the second one he spouts what seems to be gibberish, but we managed to hear what he said once, so it looks like he's trying to say something, but he isn't able to say it. He looks at us. After the seizures he is very tired and likely can't function properly for some time. This time (when he had 4 seizures in a row) I checked his cognitive functions. He didn't know his name, my name, my mother's name, couldn't tell what a certain object is, couldn't do basic arithmetic (2+2). It looked like he knew, but he had trouble with saying it, as he was constantly thinking. Before you bash me for not calling emergency services, we did, the ambulance came, did some tests, took him into a hospital and discharged him, accusing him of being an alcoholic (this was more recent, he's been of alcohol for long). We have an incredibly strict diet: for breakfast - two soft boiled eggs, half an avocado, half a tomato, a bit of salmon, a yoghurt, couple of strawberries, one sliced banana, one sliced kiwi, a bunch of blueberries, one slice of pineapple. For lunch we have either white fish, salmon or chicken (from chicken soup), rice and broccolli or red pepper. For dinner we have vegetable soup. No sugars, little to no bread (gluten free), me and my mom drink coffee with milk, he drinks coffee no milk. The poor guy has been in and out of hospitals with no results. After many things we have come to the conclusion, (this is speculative) that when he went to his father once (not divorced but separated), something must have happened (abuse or sa), that did this to him. He was on the phone with my mom, and kept saying that he can't take it anymore, and that if he doesn't come back he will in a coffin. He doesn't remember anything from then now. Currently we are being treated for an STD, so we are taking Doxycycline and Metronidazole, he takes Levetiracetam (Keppra). I can't watch someone who was so much brighter than me be destroyed by a condition he can't do anything about. I feel guilty for not being able to help him. Please help me.

PS. If you are reading this my brother, forgive me for sharing your private information, but I can watch you suffer for so long without hope.

Main Station area?,"Me and my wife will be flying in to Taipei early morning on January 24th and leaving from Kaohsiung on the 31st. So far I figured out this much:

24-25 Jan - stay in Wulai (get there in the morning, see and eat stuff, hot springs, travel to Taipei on next day)

25-29 Jan - Taipei

29-31 Jan - Kaohsiung (arrive by train, explore, fly out from here)

It feels like this will give us some time to feel the atmosphere of the Lunar New Year, see something outside of Taipei and be pretty efficient with our travels. I have booked everything but our stay in Taipei, but I still have a bit of a headache when it comes to which area we should stay in!

We like walking a lot so a fairly walkably area with some local food markets and street food, specialty coffee etc would be great, easy access to museums, funky or design shops and things to see. Not the party type. Also - we work on our laptops a little bit so looking for a place that could work for this.

Now, after reading all the subreddits, it looks like I should be looking at... Ximending (funky shops, street food, walkable?) Da'an (coffee, also walkable, but.. isn't it a bit remote?), Taipei Main Station area (well communicated?)?

In the Ximending I was looking at Taipei Garden Hotel, Hotel Resonance Taipei maybe? But is it the best area to stay? I saw some people complaining Ximending is not as funky as it used to be. Also - is there something I should not miss with regards to LNY in that timeframe?

My psychiatrist told me to take it in the morning with breakfast for a week and then have an appointment with him.

The first week was amazing, I was feeling great, finally focused, not emotionally eating, just really gave me hope. The only thing I wished was that the effect was longer than the first half of the day. I measured my BP almost every day and it was max 125/75 and no side effects (my BP is around 120/70 normally, I‚Äôd say).

Then at the appointment, my psychiatrist approved taking two a day (morning and noon) to try to extend the effect and everything went downhill from there.

The first day I tried that, in the evening, I had chest&arm pains, general chest tightness, BP up to 135/85 and just felt terrible. The next day I tried taking two doses again and same thing happened in the evening. Scared of that, I went back to only the morning dose but I don‚Äôt feel like it has as much of an effect as before and I still get random moments of higher BP, chest pain, heart pounding and all that. I don‚Äôt drink coffee or alcohol and don‚Äôt smoke, have been keeping hydrated well enough. My EKG and BP were tested and fine before starting meds and my blood tests only showed consistently elevated CRP and thrombocytes for no apparent reason but my GP and psychiatrist said that‚Äôs not a blocker for taking meds.

Is this normal and just something to get used to? Like an adjustment period?

Oh boy the cursed Exit Code 1 issue, how joyful. I've looked everywhere on reddit and on google with no answers so I will post my troubles here, sleep, then hopefully wake up with assistance in the morning üôè

My issues begin with Forge 1.19.2 where my friends and I play modded horror Minecraft. This was working earlier this morning and has always worked up until now when I installed the latest version of forge being 1.21.4 where I wanted to play with some mods (that didn't work btw bc i installed them wrong but thats not the issue). After my failure, I uninstalled 1.21.4 forge and went to load back into my 1.19 launcher.. Only to be met with the awful Exit Code 1 issue. 

I first attempted to re-click my 1.19.2 installer only to find out the Coffee/Java icon was no longer there and instead was a white and blue screen. Repetitive attempts at clicking proved useless, even after uninstalling and reinstalling my java installer.

[My java installer at the top and my 1.19.2 installer at the bottom, missing its icon. \(It had the coffee icon earlier.\)](https://preview.redd.it/92tcptpkrxde1.png?width=112&format=png&auto=webp&s=867f250a22ce8aef0a5ab4b6bc31f8b27edc8ac5)

I then turned to videos. I installed java 17 like some videos said, I've moved it to the java executable in the edit installations, I've removed the mods from the folder, I've manually put them back in one by one. I have updated my graphics drivers which were in perfect state, lovingly updated, and nice and new and working. However, without fail, Exit Code 1 continues to spite me.

Hopefully someone can figure out the issue because I've been trying to fix this for about 2 hours now without any success. This has nothing to do with any of my mods as it breaks even with no mods in the folder.

Also the actual forge website has been down or broken or something and hasn't actually let me redownload it because it keeps redirecting me to a ""This site cant be reached"" page.

1. My Perspective on ‚ÄúBlue Pill,‚Äù ‚ÄúRed Pill,‚Äù and Related Concepts

It is important to me to share my perspective on some of the popular theories surrounding relationships and dating. Terms like ‚ÄúRed Pill,‚Äù ‚ÄúBlue Pill,‚Äù the ‚ÄúManosphere,‚Äù ‚ÄúBlack Pill,‚Äù or pickup theories are not foreign to me. On the contrary, I have spent countless hours reading texts and watching videos on these subjects. I understand the foundations and thought processes behind these concepts very well.

Nevertheless, I remain critical of these theories. While they offer interesting approaches and explanations, they often reduce relationships to manipulation, control, or power dynamics. In my view, this contradicts the idea of a genuine, deep connection based on trust and mutual respect. Relationships, to me, are not tactical games but a shared life project that grows through openness and collaboration.

2. A Look Back at My Adolescence

To better understand my current thoughts, it is necessary to reflect on my adolescence. Between the ages of 12 and 18, I was an outsider. While I had a few friends, they were also on the fringes of the social hierarchy. I never belonged to a clique or was part of the ‚Äúcool crowd.‚Äù

Instead, I was often the target of bullying. These experiences deeply shaped my self-perception and views on interpersonal relationships. What weighed especially heavily was the fact that I had no organic contact with girls during this time. Without being part of a social circle, there were no natural opportunities to engage with women in conversation.

At 18, I started going to the gym regularly. Over the years, I built a muscular physique, which boosted my confidence. At 22, I began to grow a beard, giving me a more mature appearance. Outwardly, I appeared more self-assured‚Äîbut internally, I still felt isolated.

3. Early Dating Experiences

At the age of 22, I decided to take a leap and joined Tinder. Up to that point, I had no experience with women‚Äînot even a kiss or any form of intimacy. Within a few months, I went on about 15 dates. With seven of these women, I also experienced sexual encounters.

These experiences were a turning point for me. They made me feel like I was finally ‚Äúon par‚Äù with my peers. I no longer felt like an outsider who had missed out on something fundamental in life. While the sex was pleasant and gave me a sense of confidence, emotional fulfillment was still lacking.

I often found myself asking: ‚ÄúIs this really what everyone talks about?‚Äù Even as a teenager, I longed not only for physical closeness but also for a deeper emotional connection. Despite my new experiences, this longing remained unfulfilled.

4. Meeting My Ex-Girlfriend

A few months after my initial Tinder experiences, I met a woman who changed everything. She was different from the women I had met before. Her relaxed and humorous nature made it easy for me to open up. On the very first evening, we shared an intimate moment, and she asked if she could stay the night. I agreed.

That night was a transformative experience for me. As she slept beside me, I was overcome with a wave of emotions I had never felt before. I quietly cried because, for the first time in my life, I felt connected and safe.

After a few more meetings, she confessed her feelings for me and asked if I could see myself in a relationship with her. It was the first serious relationship for both of us, and I agreed. This marked the beginning of a partnership that shaped my life in ways I couldn‚Äôt have imagined.

5. Our Life Situation at the Time

To understand the dynamics of our relationship, it‚Äôs important to look at our life circumstances at the time. My ex-girlfriend lived with her parents in a town about 40 minutes away from me. Additionally, she had a small apartment in her university town, roughly 75 minutes from my home. This dual living arrangement was practical in some ways but also posed challenges, particularly regarding time and energy.

Her family situation was complicated. Her parents had a toxic marriage characterized by constant arguments and an on-again, off-again dynamic. She had suffered greatly from these conflicts during her childhood, which significantly contributed to her stress and emotional burden.

Alongside her studies, she regularly worked to support her father‚Äôs self-employment, adding to her pressures. About a year into our relationship, she took on a student job that required her to travel to a city two hours away every two weeks. In addition, she maintained social circles in both her hometown and her university town, keeping her constantly on the move. All these commitments meant we mostly saw each other on weekends.

6. Physical Characteristics of My Ex-Girlfriend

My ex-girlfriend was about 160 cm tall and weighed between 75 and 80 kg. Her slight overweight was never an issue for me. I always found her attractive, both physically and in terms of her personality. Her aura and the connection we shared were far more important to me than her physical appearance.

At the start of our relationship, my own life was relatively stable. I had a well-paying job, lived alone in my own apartment, and owned a car. However, these circumstances would change over the course of our relationship.

7. Changes in Job, Mental Health, and Finances

About a year into our relationship, I became increasingly dissatisfied with my job. The professional stress led to insomnia, nightmares, and a general sense of exhaustion. My ex-girlfriend was the only person who truly understood this internal struggle. She supported me when I decided to quit my job to prioritize my mental health.

After quitting, I started studying and took on a part-time job, which significantly reduced my income. I had to sell my car and invite my brother to move into my apartment to share the rent. These changes put a strain on our relationship, as we saw each other even less frequently. Planning vacations or larger outings was no longer possible, which further complicated the situation.

8. My Social Life

During my studies, I built new social connections. A classmate I met became a close friend. We shared similar values, often met to cook or have coffee, and had deep conversations.

I also maintained a friendship with an old acquaintance I had met through my brother. With him, I could openly discuss anything. Occasionally, we went to the movies or out to eat, but he was not the type for parties or excessive outings either.

I kept my leisure time active: I trained regularly at the gym, started jogging, and joined a weekly boxing class about three months ago. These activities helped me maintain a certain balance in my life.

9. The Relationship with My Ex-Girlfriend

Our relationship was characterized by deep emotional and physical closeness from the start. Throughout our partnership, we had a fulfilling love life and explored new things together. But it was the emotional level that made our connection so special.

A pivotal moment was when I opened up to her about my experiences with bullying in school. I broke down in tears, and she held me without judgment. It was the first time I allowed myself to be so vulnerable with someone. Similarly, she cried in my arms when sharing the conflicts with her father. This mutual openness created a deep, authentic connection I had never experienced in any previous relationship.

Her family welcomed me warmly, and I got along well with her parents despite their strained relationship. Her friends also liked me and spoke positively about our relationship. Whenever conflicts arose, we resolved them through open conversations, never going to bed angry.

10. Strains on the Relationship

Despite the strong bond we shared, our relationship was not without its challenges. The physical distance, her numerous commitments, and my reduced income introduced obstacles.

My ex-girlfriend was often under significant stress due to her studies, work responsibilities, supporting her father, and her complicated family dynamics. Additionally, her extended family frequently expected her to attend family gatherings, which placed even more pressure on her. All of these obligations left her emotionally drained, affecting the quality of our time together.

My financial situation also became a source of tension. While she repeatedly reassured me that she loved me regardless of my income, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel inadequate. We could no longer plan vacations together, and even spontaneous outings became rare. This, combined with the demands of her schedule, meant we spent less and less meaningful time together.

11. The Sudden Breakup

The breakup came as a complete shock to me. Just two weeks prior, we had been talking about having children together, and everything seemed fine. There were no indications that she was contemplating ending the relationship. Our love life remained fulfilling, we hadn‚Äôt had any major arguments, and she continued to show affection.

Then, out of nowhere, she told me she wanted to end things. It felt as though the ground had been ripped out from under me.

12. The Conversation After the Breakup

After her decision, we spent one final day and night together, which felt surreal and emotionally overwhelming. Through tears, she explained that she was overwhelmed by her family obligations, academic workload, and other pressures. She admitted to feeling as though she had to meet everyone‚Äôs expectations while neglecting her own needs.

She also revealed that she had been seeing a psychologist who diagnosed her with acute stress disorder and an avoidant attachment style. She said she still loved me but felt unable to give me the relationship I deserved.

We spent the entire day crying, hugging, and reminiscing about the past two years. Her final words to me were: ‚ÄúMaybe our paths will cross again someday.‚Äù

13. Life After the Breakup

After we parted ways, we agreed to have no contact. There were no messages, no calls‚Äîcomplete silence. The first two weeks felt like living in a fog. I spent most of my time alone in my dimly lit apartment, crying frequently and losing my appetite. The emptiness I felt was all-consuming.

Gradually, I tried to rebuild my life. I returned to the gym, signed up for boxing classes, and focused more on my studies. Outwardly, I was making progress, but the emptiness inside remained. It wasn‚Äôt just a person I had lost; it was my emotional anchor and sense of home.

14. Dating After the Breakup

About a month after the breakup, I started dating again. Within three weeks, I went on six first dates, three of which led to sexual encounters. Two of these were one-night stands, while the third turned into a friends-with-benefits arrangement.

With this woman, I‚Äôve been able to explore my sexual side and experiment. However, the emotional fulfillment is still missing. After every meeting, I feel empty and wonder why none of these interactions can match the depth of my previous relationship.

15. What I Miss About a Relationship

It‚Äôs not just the grand gestures that I miss but the small, everyday moments that make a relationship meaningful. For instance, the morning text that makes you feel like you‚Äôre someone‚Äôs first thought of the day. Or cuddling‚Äînot with just anyone, but with someone who truly matters to you on a deep level.

These moments held a unique significance with my ex. Even mundane activities like cooking together or laughing at an inside joke felt fulfilling. In my current casual arrangement or in my one-night stands, I don‚Äôt feel that emotional depth. It‚Äôs just a hollow shell without substance.

What hurts most is envisioning the future and realizing that the plans we made together no longer exist. That shared sense of purpose and vision is gone, leaving a void that‚Äôs hard to fill.

16. My Desire for a Family

I‚Äôve always dreamed of starting a family. The idea of becoming a father, raising children, and building a stable, loving home with a partner fills me with a sense of purpose.

My parents, who have been married for over 30 years, are living proof that it‚Äôs possible to maintain a partnership through all of life‚Äôs ups and downs. They‚Äôve shown me that love is not just a feeling but a conscious decision to take responsibility for one another and grow together.

My relationship with my ex felt like a step toward that dream. We shared similar aspirations for the future. Losing that vision isn‚Äôt just painful‚Äîit‚Äôs left a gap in my life that feels impossible to fill.

17. The Fast-Paced Nature of Modern Relationships

I‚Äôve noticed that many relationships today seem to be discarded far too quickly. Challenges and conflicts are no longer seen as opportunities for growth but as insurmountable barriers.

It feels as though people are increasingly focused on the idea that the next partner might be better, rather than investing in the relationship they already have. To me, this mindset is disheartening and immature. Love, for me, means sticking together through tough times and not questioning everything at the first sign of trouble.

18. My Ex‚Äôs Fear of Commitment

One of the main reasons for our breakup was my ex‚Äôs avoidant attachment style. Her childhood experiences and her parents‚Äô toxic marriage deeply influenced her. In stressful moments, she tended to withdraw emotionally rather than seek closeness.

While I understand her motivations, the breakup is still hard for me to accept. It hurts that she chose to face her struggles alone rather than see our relationship as a source of strength and support.

19. Inner Conflict After the Breakup

I find myself caught in a constant internal conflict. On one hand, I want to move forward and give my new relationship a fair chance. On the other, I still hold on to the hope that my ex and I might find our way back to each other someday.

This hope makes it difficult for me to fully commit emotionally to my new partner. I‚Äôm afraid of opening myself up again and risking further heartbreak.

20. Realism and Hope

I‚Äôm aware that my ex might already be in a new relationship. Just as I‚Äôve dated other women, it‚Äôs possible that she has moved on. Yet, the hope that our paths could cross again remains alive.

This lingering hope prevents me from fully letting go. It‚Äôs a painful feeling to be stuck in the past while knowing the future remains uncertain.

21. The Missing Stage of Anger

Many people say that after a breakup, they go through a phase of anger. For me, that stage never came. I‚Äôve never felt resentment toward my ex. Instead, I‚Äôve been consumed by a deep sense of longing and quiet sadness.

Even when I think about our last moments together, there‚Äôs no anger‚Äîonly the wish to turn back time and restore our connection. I don‚Äôt dwell on what she could have done differently or blame her for how things ended. My emotions remain rooted in sorrow and a profound sense of loss.

22. Relationships After First Love

There‚Äôs something uniquely profound about a first love. It carries an innocence and purity that is difficult to recreate after both partners have experienced prior relationships or heartbreaks.

In my current relationship, I miss the depth and lightheartedness I felt with my ex. It seems as though a part of my ability to love with complete openness and vulnerability has been irreparably damaged. Later relationships inevitably carry the weight of past experiences, making it harder to reach that same unguarded depth.

23. Long-Term Perspective on Relationships

When I enter into a relationship, it‚Äôs not with the goal of ending it after a year or two. I don‚Äôt seek short-term flings or temporary connections. I‚Äôm looking for a partner with whom I can build a future.

In today‚Äôs world, it seems increasingly rare for people to think long-term. Many seem to enjoy the initial ‚Äúhoneymoon phase‚Äù of a relationship but give up as soon as everyday challenges arise. I long for a partner who, like me, is willing to work on the relationship, someone who wants to face life‚Äôs ups and downs together and shares the goal of building a family.

24. Relationship Trauma and the End of First Love

The breakup with my ex wasn‚Äôt just the end of a relationship‚Äîit left deep scars in my understanding of love. It‚Äôs difficult for me to truly move on because our relationship ended with words of love and the hope for a potential reunion in the future.

The first love is special. It‚Äôs untouched by the emotional baggage and disappointments that often come with later relationships. When I think about how authentic and unrestrained our connection was, I wonder if I‚Äôll ever experience something like that again. In subsequent relationships, both partners inevitably bring their past traumas, making it harder to achieve the same kind of pure, unencumbered connection.

25. My Current Relationship

After about 20 dates, I am now in a relationship with my current girlfriend. She is a wonderful woman, and objectively speaking, our relationship is going well. We understand each other, share common interests, and haven‚Äôt faced any significant conflicts.

Yet, despite all the positives, a part of me remains with my ex. There are moments when her memory suddenly overtakes me‚Äîher voice, her laugh, the way she looked at me. These memories often leave me in tears because I miss her so deeply.

While my current girlfriend offers me security and affection, I find myself holding back emotionally. The intensity of feelings I experienced with my ex is missing, and it feels as though I‚Äôm guarding a part of myself, afraid of being hurt again.

26. Infidelity and Emotional Connection

During my relationship with my ex, infidelity was never an option for me. Our emotional connection was so strong that I never even entertained the thought of being with someone else. Even when I found other women attractive, no one could replace the bond we shared.

In my current relationship, the emotional connection isn‚Äôt as deep. I sometimes wonder if this is because I still tie my feelings to my ex. It feels as though I‚Äôm constantly comparing, making it difficult to establish the same closeness with my new partner.

27. What the Breakup Did to My Worldview

The breakup fundamentally shook my belief in the stability of relationships. I used to think that love could last forever if both partners were committed to making it work. Now, I struggle to hold on to that belief.

With my ex, everything felt genuine and real. The moments we shared had a depth that I don‚Äôt feel in my current relationship. I often wonder if that kind of connection was a once-in-a-lifetime experience‚Äîsomething I might never find again.

28. Critique of Pickup Philosophy

One aspect that bothers me deeply is the stance many pickup theories take on relationships. They often advocate that men should always remain independent and view emotional reliance as a weakness, suggesting that relationships should never take precedence over personal goals.

To me, this perspective contradicts the essence of a true partnership. A relationship isn‚Äôt a side project or a casual addition to one‚Äôs life. It‚Äôs a shared life endeavor, where both partners work together, support each other, and grow together.

I often think of my parents, who have been married for over 30 years. Their relationship isn‚Äôt based on independence but on a deep sense of responsibility and mutual support. They‚Äôve faced challenges together and emerged stronger. For me, that‚Äôs the true meaning of love.

29. The ‚ÄúTimeline‚Äù of My Life

The breakup didn‚Äôt just end our relationship; it disrupted the timeline of my life. With my ex, I had a clear vision of our future: a house, children, a stable life together. That vision felt real and gave me a sense of direction and purpose.

Now, it feels like my life has gone off track. Sometimes I think the only way to ‚Äúfix‚Äù this timeline is to reunite with her. Everything else feels like a substitute that will never carry the same meaning.

30. The Feeling of Home

With my ex, I had a sense of home that I haven‚Äôt found since. Our relationship wasn‚Äôt just a connection; it was a profound feeling of safety and belonging.

Even in my current relationship, this feeling is absent. While my girlfriend is loving and caring, I lack the same foundational trust and comfort I experienced with my ex. That sense of ‚Äúhome‚Äù remains an ideal I‚Äôm still searching for.

31. Why People Give Up on Relationships Too Quickly

I often see people giving up on relationships far too quickly. Instead of working through challenges, they opt for a breakup, convinced that the next partner will be better. This mindset saddens me.

Love isn‚Äôt effortless. It requires work, patience, and a willingness to endure difficult times together. For me, a relationship isn‚Äôt something you discard when it no longer feels perfect‚Äîit‚Äôs a commitment to grow together, even when it‚Äôs hard.

32. Perspectives on the Future

I want a relationship that endures. A partnership not based solely on fleeting passion but on a deep, conscious commitment to one another. The thought of constantly starting over is daunting. I long for a relationship that becomes a steady anchor in my life.

At the same time, the hope that my ex and I might one day find our way back to each other lingers. This hope keeps me tethered to the past, even as it complicates my ability to focus on the present.

33. Final Thoughts

The breakup didn‚Äôt just break my heart; it fundamentally altered my belief in the permanence of love. Still, I hope that one day I‚Äôll experience a connection as fulfilling as the one I had with my ex.

For me, love isn‚Äôt just a fleeting emotion‚Äîit‚Äôs a conscious decision to take responsibility for one another, to grow together, and to share a life. That remains my ultimate goal, even though the path to get there is full of challenges.

Your outfit is like the movie trailer of your personality: does it hype you up or flop at the box office?

And You don‚Äôt need to spend like a celebrity on the red. A few good, versatile pieces that can be combined in a different ways. 
Don't fall into the trap of buying trendy, low-quality clothes because  trends come and go, a well-curated, timeless wardrobe will always work in your favor.





Let‚Äôs break it down:
(I have used some fashion & style terms like straight-fit, baggy jeans etc and if you feel; what the heck, they are? Just Search the web if you want to buy the specifics.)


1. Building a Versatile Wardrobe Around Basics üîÑ

Imagine your wardrobe is like a video game skill tree. Start with the essential upgrades before branching out. Basics are those upgrades‚Äîthey‚Äôre timeless, versatile, and can adapt to almost any situation and you can mix match basics to create different looks.

The Must-Have Basics

White Shirt: The MVP of your wardrobe. Works for formal meetings, casual hangouts, or dates.

Basic Tees (Black & White): These are like the foundation of a house‚Äîget them right, and you can build anything on top.

Dark Jeans: The classic that never fails. Just say no to bedazzled, ripped jeans from 2010.

Chinos: Think of these as jeans‚Äô sophisticated cousin. They‚Äôre comfortable, classy, and can go formal or casual.

Blazer: A navy or grey blazer is your cheat code for instant sophistication.

Polo Shirt: Halfway between a tee and a shirt, perfect for looking sharp while staying comfy.

Casual Jacket: A denim or bomber jacket is your go-to for layering and cooler weather.

Well-Fitted Trousers: For when jeans won‚Äôt cut it, these are essential for formal or business settings.


Think of these as your Avengers. Alone, they‚Äôre strong. Together, they‚Äôre unstoppable.



2. Fit is King: Dress Your Type üï∂Ô∏è

You wouldn‚Äôt play a game on a laggy PC, right? Same with your clothes‚Äîthey need to fit perfectly to function. Fit is what separates ‚Äúput together‚Äù from ‚Äúfell out of bed.‚Äù

Dress for Your Body Type üìè

Shorter Men:

Slim-fit is your friend; baggy clothes will make you look shorter.

Vertical patterns (think pinstripes) add the illusion of height.

Monochrome(same color upper and lower wear) outfits streamline your look and make you appear taller.


Tall Men:

Avoid clothes that are too tight or too baggy‚Äîbalance is key.
Layering (like a jacket over a tee) breaks up your height nicely.
Medium-fits keep your proportions in check.


Slim Build:

Choose clothes that add visual weight, like checks or textured fabrics.
Henley shirts add volume without looking bulky.
Avoid overly skinny fits‚Äîthey‚Äôll make you look smaller.



Muscular/Stocky Build:

Straight-cut trousers and relaxed fits for your frame.
Stick to neutral tones and avoid busy patterns.
Subtle checks and herringbone patterns can help balance your look.

3. Understanding Color Theory for Indian Skin Tones üé®

Let‚Äôs talk colors. Imagine your outfit is a painting. Pick the wrong colors, and the painting looks off. Choose the right ones, and it‚Äôs a masterpiece.


Undertones: A Crash Course

Undertones are the natural colors underneath your skin that affect how different clothes look on you. Knowing your undertone helps you pick clothes that suit your skin and make you look great.
If you can't get it, just search for these actors or actresses below and look at their skin tone and then undertone:

Cool Undertones:

2. Emma Stone (Fair Skin)
3. Lupita Nyong'o (Dark Skin)
4. Zayn Malik (Medium Skin)

Best colors that'll suit you? Blues, navy, grey, and black.

Warm Undertones: Yellow or peachy hues mean earthy tones like olive, brown, beige, and khaki will look great.

Neutral Undertones: Almost anything works! Just avoid extremes.

Best Colors for Indian Skin Tones üëï

Fair Skin: Soft blues, cool greys, black, white, burgundy, and emerald green. Avoid very pale pastels.

Medium Skin: Olive green, navy blue, charcoal, beige, white, and mustard yellow. Earthy tones work well here.

Dark Skin: Bold colors like royal blue, burgundy, purple, deep green, and rust look amazing. Steer clear of pale colors or anything too close to your skin tone, which can wash you out.

Some Practical Tips for Buying Clothes Smartly üõçÔ∏è

Building a wardrobe doesn‚Äôt mean you need to rush into a mall and spend all your money on the first thing you see. Take your time, be strategic, and focus on the value of what you‚Äôre purchasing.



While, offline purchase can be done easily, Here are a few online buying tips that will make the process easier:

1st Find your Size: 
Buy few clothes to find your size and make sure they fit well. Bring a measuring tape with you and measure key areas like chest, waist, and inseam to help when shopping online later.


2nd Wishlist Clothes Online & Buy When Prices Drop: 
Once you‚Äôve figured out what fits you well, wishlist your favorite items online. Wait for sales or price drops before buying. Most brands and stores will offer seasonal discounts, so patience is your best tool and slowly, build your personal wardrobe over time.




3rd Understand That Not Everything Will Work: 
Sometimes, you might think a piece looks amazing on the rack or online, but once you try it on, it might not feel right. ""Eat food as per your taste, but clothing as per the taste of others."" You might love that bright, branded logo shirt, but others might feel it‚Äôs too flashy or not suitable for your body type. The key is to focus on what works for you(comfort wise) and what others will find attractive.


4th Avoid Flashy Designs and Excessive Patterns: 
Flashy logos or clothes with too many symbols can come off as immature. These items may look trendy now, but they‚Äôll quickly feel outdated. Instead, go for solid, simple pieces. Classic designs never go out of style, and even as you grow older, they will continue to serve you well.


5th Buy Quality, Not Branding:
Social status is often judged by whether or not someone is wearing a recognizable brand. If you don‚Äôt wear a brand (like me), it doesn‚Äôt matter. Focus on quality. Look for clothes that don‚Äôt have logos or brand names on the outside. When you buy pieces with no visible logos, people won‚Äôt be distracted by the brand‚Äîthey‚Äôll focus on the fit, quality, and style of the clothing itself.



For example, a denim jacket without a brand logo will make people notice your unique sense of style, rather than what‚Äôs printed on the jacket. You want to be recognized for your taste, not the logo on your chest.


Final Thought:

Dressing well isn‚Äôt about following trends or buying everything with a brand logo. It's about strategically building your wardrobe around quality basics, focusing on fit, and choosing timeless pieces that can be mixed and matched for any occasion.

Remember, your clothing isn‚Äôt just about you‚Äîit‚Äôs about the message it sends to others. Start building your wardrobe with these tips, and level up your style. Share this guide with others who need help dressing smartly.

I tried normal to-do lists, but they‚Äôd quickly get lost under a mountain of other tasks or I'd forget about them.

So I hacked together a tool that turns quick voice notes into organised tasks and tags. It started as a personal sanity-saver, but my friends and family jumped in too and said it was worth paying for.

I call it mmbl‚Äîbasically, it transcribes your ramblings, auto-detects tasks, adds tags, and syncs them to your calendar.

My brother uses it to rattle off his daily to-dos while making coffee, and by the time he‚Äôs done, his day is fully mapped out. Another friend uses it to generate tweets from their ramblings. It‚Äôs like dumping your brain out without the guilt of cluttered notes and being able to ask about it later.

I also started using it to whip up content like tweets and blog posts by using it to draft something based on my notes‚Äîit‚Äôs surprisingly good at saving me from blank-page syndrome. And if I need to find that random idea from last month, I can just search in natural language instead of scrolling through endless lists.

If you‚Äôre curious, here‚Äôs the link: [https://mmbl.io](https://mmbl.io)

Would love any thoughts or feedback. It‚Äôs still rough around the edges, but it‚Äôs already making life easier for me (and apparently a few others). It's free to try so give it a shot, there's a one-time fee too for unlimited usage.

If anyone likes it and wants to subscribe to premium - here's a discount code for 20% off your first month: `K1NDK3O`

I posted it on r/sideproject and had some really nice feedback from people saying how useful it is which is great to see and I've been able to make improvements pretty quickly from that which is great.

Features currently in the works:  
\- Sorting tasks by duration, due date and more

For both hobbyists and professionals, woodworking plans are essential. They ensure you stay on track, avoid costly mistakes, and produce high-quality results. If you‚Äôve ever tried woodworking without a plan, you know the importance of having a clear blueprint in hand.

In this article, we‚Äôll explore the different types of woodworking plans, how to select the right one for your needs, the benefits of using a woodworking plans book, and much more.

# Types of Woodworking Plans

A woodworking plans book typically categorizes projects into various levels of difficulty and project types. Let‚Äôs explore these categories in more detail:

# Beginner-Level Plans

For those just starting out, beginner plans often focus on small, simple projects. These projects use basic woodworking techniques and require minimal tools, making them ideal for those who want to get their hands dirty without the fear of failure. Examples include picture frames, wooden toys, and small shelves.

# Intermediate-Level Plans

As your woodworking skills develop, you may want to challenge yourself with intermediate-level projects. These plans tend to include more detailed instructions and can involve additional techniques such as joinery and finishing. Projects might include coffee tables, cabinets, and more complex shelves.

# Advanced-Level Plans

Advanced woodworking plans are designed for experienced woodworkers looking for intricate designs and sophisticated builds. These plans often require expert-level skills, specialized tools, and knowledge of woodworking techniques such as dovetail joints, marquetry, or veneering. Projects in this category include custom furniture, large shelving systems, and even woodworking for fine art.

# Specialized Plans

Woodworking books also provide specialized plans for specific needs or interests. For example, there are plans dedicated to creating functional furniture, artistic sculptures, or outdoor structures. Specialized books focus on projects like garden furniture, bookcases, or even intricate wooden carvings.

# What to Look for in a Good Woodworking Plans Book

When selecting a woodworking plans book, it's essential to consider several factors to ensure it meets your needs and helps you succeed with your projects. Here‚Äôs what to look for:

# Clear Instructions and Diagrams

A quality woodworking plans book should provide clear and concise instructions. Diagrams and illustrations are crucial to understanding the steps and visualizing the finished product. Look for books that break down complex steps into simple, easy-to-follow instructions.

# Materials List and Specifications

A good woodworking plans book will always include a comprehensive materials list for each project. This list should specify the type, quantity, and dimensions of wood, hardware, and tools required. It‚Äôs important to be able to easily gather everything needed before starting a project.

# Skill Level Appropriateness

Choose a book that matches your skill level. Some books are tailored to beginners, with simpler projects and fewer tools, while others target intermediate or advanced woodworkers. If you're just starting, look for books that provide tutorials on basic skills and techniques.

# Tools and Equipment Recommendations

For each project, a woodworking plans book should outline the tools required and recommend alternatives for common tools. This helps ensure that you have the right equipment on hand and helps you plan your budget accordingly.

# Step-by-Step Guidance

Look for books that provide detailed, step-by-step guidance for each project. Each phase should be broken down into manageable steps with clear instructions. A good plan will prevent confusion and ensure your project progresses smoothly.

# Design and Layout of the Plans

The design and layout of the plans are important for readability and ease of understanding. The most effective books feature layouts that are visually appealing and well-organized, with easy-to-read text and large, detailed diagrams.

# Difficulty Levels and Time Estimates

Good woodworking books often categorize projects based on difficulty levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced) and provide estimated time frames for each project. This helps you set realistic expectations and allows you to plan your time effectively.

# Benefits of Using a Woodworking Plans Book

There are numerous benefits to using a woodworking plans book when tackling your projects:

# Time Savings and Efficiency

By following a structured plan, you save time and avoid unnecessary delays. Pre-made plans ensure you won‚Äôt have to figure out every detail on your own, helping you work more efficiently.

# Reducing Errors and Mistakes

Without a clear plan, it‚Äôs easy to make mistakes, which can be costly in terms of both time and materials. Woodworking plans minimize errors by providing exact measurements and step-by-step guidance, ensuring your final product matches the intended design.

# Learning New Techniques

Woodworking plans books are not just about building projects‚Äîthey also teach new techniques. Whether it‚Äôs mastering a specific joinery style, learning how to finish wood, or getting familiar with advanced tools, a good woodworking book is an excellent learning tool.

# Cost-Effectiveness

While buying wood and tools can be expensive, using woodworking plans can ultimately save you money. A well-written plan helps you avoid waste, buy just what you need, and reduce the chances of costly errors.

# Enhancing Creativity

Woodworking plans allow you to express your creativity within a structured framework. While you follow the instructions, there‚Äôs still room for customization. You can adjust designs, add personal touches, or create new variations of existing plans.

# Boosting Confidence in Woodworking Skills

Successfully completing a woodworking project from a plan builds your confidence. As you finish each project, you gain skills, knowledge, and experience, making you more comfortable tackling future woodworking challenges.

# Common Challenges with Woodworking Plans

While woodworking plans are incredibly helpful, there are some common challenges that may arise:

# Misinterpretation of Diagrams

Woodworking diagrams can sometimes be difficult to read, especially for beginners. Misunderstanding dimensions or assembly steps can lead to mistakes. This is why selecting a clear and detailed plan is crucial.

# Difficulty with Complex Projects

Advanced woodworking plans may involve intricate techniques and complicated designs that are difficult to follow. If you‚Äôre unsure about the plan, it‚Äôs always helpful to seek expert advice or watch tutorial videos.

# Limited Material Options

Some woodworking plans specify materials that may not be easily accessible or affordable. While most books will provide alternatives, it‚Äôs important to be flexible and adjust your plan as needed based on what you have available.

# Budget Constraints

Some woodworking projects require expensive materials, tools, or equipment. If you‚Äôre on a budget, you‚Äôll need to select projects that fit within your financial constraints. Many books also offer tips on sourcing cheaper materials or modifying plans to reduce costs.

# Limited Knowledge of Woodworking Tools

Not all woodworking plans will account for the fact that beginners may not own every tool needed. It‚Äôs important to assess the tools listed in the plans and ensure you either have access to them or can substitute with more basic tools.

# Choosing the Right Woodworking Plans Book

With so many woodworking books available, choosing the right one can be challenging. Here‚Äôs a guide to help you make an informed decision:

# Top Considerations When Selecting a Book

* **Your Skill Level**: Ensure the book matches your current woodworking skills.
* **Project Variety**: Choose a book that offers a variety of projects so you can expand your skills.
* **Detailed Instructions**: The book should provide clear, detailed instructions and diagrams.

# Popular Woodworking Plans Book Authors and Publishers

* **The Complete Manual of Woodworking** by Albert Jackson
* **The Essential Woodworker** by Robert Wearing
* **The Complete Book of Woodworking** by Tom Carpenter
* **The Ultimate Woodworker's Guide** by John H. Nelson

# Online vs. Printed Woodworking Plans Books

While printed books have their charm, online woodworking books can offer interactive features like videos and downloadable plans. Digital books also tend to be updated more frequently, providing you with the latest techniques and trends.

# Reviews and Recommendations

Before purchasing a woodworking plans book, it‚Äôs always wise to read reviews and recommendations. Online woodworking communities or forums can provide valuable insight into which books are considered the best by fellow woodworkers.

# Price Range and Value for Money

Woodworking plans books can vary significantly in price. While high-quality books may be more expensive, consider the value they offer in terms of the number of plans, clarity, and skill-building opportunities they provide.

# Specialty Woodworking Books

Look for books that cater to your specific needs or interests. For example, if you‚Äôre interested in vintage furniture restoration, there are books focused on this niche. Specialized books allow you to dive deep into particular areas of woodworking, enhancing your knowledge and expertise.

I really enjoy reading the discussions on this page and wanted to ask the community, when do you take your apple cider vinegar?

I started taking it in the morning and felt it was a great tool to wake me up for various reasons. Anything from it's pretty rough taste, to the small amount of testing that gives some evidence towards ACV, replacing your morning coffee.

After 5 months of taking it in the morning, I wanted to test the impact of ACV consumption in the evening. Like I said in my first paragraph, I'm still taking my ACV in the morning and personally, there are far more reasons for me taking it in the evening.

I know everyone is impacted differently and was really interested in understanding 'WHY' to the 'WHEN' people take their ACV.

So I did a bit of research and spent a lot of time and effort on a video around the [impacts I saw at different times of the day](https://youtu.be/rPXkhe0wi18), in order to generate some conversation.

I try to be and I am a very kind, good and caring person, everybody from colleagues to friends to relatives has been telling me that since I became an adult. And I believe it too. 

The problem is that appart from a group of some very good old friends I have from high school (of both genders) I have no other real relations with people, and of course I never had a romantic relationship with a woman. As a result I have nobody to share my love, help, and generally go through life together.
   
And as I get older I see the love lives of my friends change and starting to get serious, for example: 
* some have long relationships and are traveling the world together
* others are marring and moving in together to start a family
* others moved to foreign countries and have already started metting parterns there who they believe could be their lifelong companions.

Don't get me wrong, I too have achieved some things in my life, I have the work I want, I have finished the degree I wanted while working, I have some hobbies I enjoy. It's just that I have done all of them alone, in isolation... 

Meaning that apart from that small friend group, I have no other real people connections, and certainly not a romantic one... Every other person I happen to meet in life, in work or in my hobbies nowadays (men or women) are always kind and into talking with me, but never ever into becoming better friends (for men or women) or interested in a romantic relationship with me (for women). Most of my relationships stay at the ""surface"" let's say, and whenever I ask (a woman for example) if she would like to grab a coffee or something with me sometime, she either outright ghosts me or accepts and then makes it clear (with her actions or directly) that she is not interested in me, and I respect that.

And all that long text brings us to the **tldr**: **appart from my family and mayby a small group of friends no-one really cares about me, I have no-one to share my love** *(which believe me I have accumulated plenty)* **, life, or care about each other** it's like if I die tomorrow, my parrents will certainly mourn, but that's probably it...

When I was younger, I didn't bother so much about it, I was telling to myself *""don't worry about it will come when you least expect"" ""try to meet new people and it will happen"" ""just be you, socialize and you'll find someone""* but this hasn't gotten me anywhere, clearly there is something wrong with me. 

Mayby people on social media like Andrew Tate (which I hate) are right about people like me, that I am a fucking nobody, and thus, why would anybody care about me? And if that's true, should I just accept that I'll be the lonely uncle in the family gathering and stop presuing anything? (because believe me, the more I get rejected the worse it fells and I can't get much more of it) (and because there is no way I am going down the hyper macho man road, I better stay who I am and lonely, than a bad person and popular)

*Also, to highlight the extent of the above problem, I have developed a severe porn addiction, it's the only thing that helps me nowadays. I am trying to quit it ASAP but it's not easy...*",2,1737283905.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

* Make every unit viable ~~(except Kayano she can stay dead)~~
   * 3\* units are getting A3s if possible, as well as rebalanced stats
* Rework certain units/mechanics to make them feel more unique
   * For instance, Captain Swapping is planned to become a Water-focused gimmick, with a playstyle centered on constantly switching between different units
* Nerf problematic units (Dark Tile Reinhart, Rachel, Claymore, ~~Yao~~), and make sure no one feels oppressive
   * If Claymore‚Äôs bugs can‚Äôt be fixed, we‚Äôll come up with another plan
   * The sheet describes different plans for Victoria: Elegy

After listening to Andrew Huberman and Peter Attia, here‚Äôs the general guideline they suggest: Cardio: A couple of hours a week. Resistance training: 2-3x a week. HIIT: ~30 minutes a week.

My View: Cardio: Based on the CDC, 75-150 minutes of cardio is more than enough to get most of the cognitive benefits from exercise. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily involve jogging or running, Type 2 cardio, like fast walking, is sufficient for optimal results.

Resistance Training: The benefits of resistance training are mostly related to boosting testosterone, IGF-1, and increasing BDNF. For testosterone, low and high levels seem to be the most problematic. A study shows that having moderate testosterone levels is the most beneficial for fluid intelligence, while high testosterone is known to reduce spatial and non-verbal intelligence. Increasing IGF-1 is beneficial for kids below the age of 10 but isn‚Äôt particularly helpful for adults. As for BDNF, most of it is produced during cardio. Meditation and even drinking coffee can also increase BDNF.

HIIT: There‚Äôs no unique benefit HIIT provides that cardio doesn‚Äôt, except when it comes to improving VO2 max. However, VO2 max is already highly correlated with resting heart rate, and training specifically for it won‚Äôt make you any better at cognitive tests.

Exercise offers several benefits, such as hippocampal neurogenesis, BDNF boost, and increased neuroplasticity, which are mostly achieved through 75-150 minutes of Type 2 cardio (fast walking) which most of us get indirectly through daily activities.

Resistance training can be useful later in life (near retirement) to prevent sarcopenia or osteoporosis, but beyond that, it‚Äôs not very beneficial, especially not HIIT.",1,1737283728.0,selfimprovement,0,1.0,False

I have posted in here before. 

For context: He has been checked in since March of 2024 and will be here through April 2025. He‚Äôs brought me ice cream, food on several occasions. I‚Äôve run into him off property once on accident at a carnival. When his sister came to town, he introduced her to me. She kept joking about ringing the bell‚Ä¶ teasing him almost‚Ä¶ hahaha, before he actually introduced me to her they were exiting off the elevator and he said 
‚Äú Speak of the devil ‚Äú when he seen me 
and she said , ‚Äú Oh she is pretty‚Ä¶‚Äù 

* While this is normal to meet guests family members due to the nature of our hotel, no one else met his sister. Nobody else on the team. And my coworkers made it a point to mention it to me. *

I was in the elevator and he proceeded to get on at his floor, and he asked me how my day was going, and then if there were cameras in the elevator and if they were working. I told him there were cameras and they were working. Cause that elevator was HOT AND STEAMY. 

He needed help in guest laundry room and proceeded to show me something on the app guests can use to do laundry on this phone. I turned to look, he turned to show me, and our arms full on touched. I sound like a school girl. However the reason this is a kind of odd is because  99.9% of the time when I touch a guest on accident we both immediately back away and apologize. It happens, not like this though. And we just stood there. For a solid 5 minutes. Talking about the app. Neither of us moved. Just kept touching. 

He went to go ask me what I was doing one weekend.. I said ‚Äú I‚Äôll be here ‚Äú and he laughed and said, ‚Äú well me too then I guess ‚Äú before telling me about this dairy farm he wanted to go to for ice cream. The next day, he brought me ice cream from said dairy farm. 
‚Äî- 

with all of that being said, nothing has come of this. and I don‚Äôt think anything will, but then stuff like this keeps happening and it pulls me back in. 

recently went down to 2 days a week as I‚Äôm working at another site 5 days a week. This was brought up with my boss as he was asking me how it was going at the new site and asking how I felt about going part time at his site. 

I explained it‚Äôs going good, I definitely miss being full time but I‚Äôve been ready for a change of pace for a while. 

This guest was in the lobby getting his coffee while we were having this conversation. 
 
He then approached the desk, needing his key remade, congratulating me on the new job and said, ‚Äú So this means I‚Äôll see you even less then I already do? ‚Äú 

And I have no idea knowing what he meant by that. But damn did it make my heart race. He could have been relived for all I know. 

How do I move on from this?? Everytime I see him, even working two days a week my heart races. I blush so hard whenever he speaks to me. My boss will out right tease me. My AGM always refers to him as ‚Äú my friend. ‚Äú 

We have never crossed any physical boundaries. I‚Äôve always tried my best to avoid that from happening. I‚Äôve always said to myself if he wanted to ask me out he would. 

How do y‚Äôall get over a crush like this? I am just a 23 year old and limerence is rough.

I read that it was most likely due to a calorie deficit at the time. 

I decided to try it again with a better diet and no other supplements besides fish oil. Currently day 19 of that trial and to summarize.. my anxiety has all but vanished at the cost of a good night's sleep. It's kind of a calm energy that makes phone calls at work not painful, I don't feel shaky and uncomfortable when people are looking at me, I can really just talk to anyone calmly. It's a substantial difference for quality of life, so over the past 2 days I tried tauromag and melatonin but I could still only stay asleep for just under 6 hours. 

I take it first thing after waking up along with food and eventually a coffee before work. I don't feel fatigued at all during the day in the sense that I don't crash like when taking other calming substances -> I do start to feel too tired on the tail end of my work week with a large sleep debt. I also don't get an upset stomach - in fact, it noticeably improves digestive health.

The only other thing that seems to remove anxiety is tribulus but tribulus, tribugen, and dioscorea all cause my heart rate to drop to such an alarmingly low resting rate of around (and just below..) 40bpm. Seriously, I've trialed that one way more thoroughly and that result never fails. Tribulus and dioscorea are also prohibitively hard on my stomach. 


I live in Canada so I can't continue taking it anymore anyway (added to cart, went through checkout process and it says I need to use a different address to get shipping options because of the shipping restriction on DHEA), but I'll certainly be trying to replicate the experience without the DHEA and poor sleep.",3,1737283714.0,NootropicsDepot,0,0.81,False

I arrived at the Oslo Schakselskap chess club at 2:45 PM, 15 minutes before my scheduled interview with Magnus Carlsen. As a journalist for Chess Monthly, I had prepared extensively for this meeting.

Magnus walked in at 3:00 PM, wearing a navy blue hoodie and jeans. ""Hei, sorry I'm a bit late,"" he said.
We shook hands, and I introduced myself. 
Magnus smiled. ""No problem, happy to chat.""
We walked to a nearby caf√©, where Magnus ordered a kaffe og vann (coffee with water) and I set up my recorder. Our conversation began with his recent win at the Tata Steel Masters tournament.
As we spoke, I noted Magnus's thoughtful responses and insightful analysis of the game. He discussed his strategy and decision-making process, providing valuable context for my article.

But as the interview progressed, I found myself drawn to Magnus's intense gaze and chiseled features. My questions became increasingly flirtatious, and Magnus's responses grew more playful.
Finally, I turned off my recorder and leaned in close. ""I think we've covered enough chess for today, Magnus.""
Magnus's eyes locked onto mine, burning with intensity. ""I think you're right,"" he whispered.
Without another word, Magnus leaned in, his lips brushing against mine. The kiss deepened, and I felt myself melting into his arms.
We stumbled out of the caf√©, hands entwined, and made our way back to Magnus's apartment. The rest of the evening was a blur of passion and desire.

As we lay tangled in the sheets, Magnus whispered, ""Checkmate.""
I smiled, my heart still racing. ""I think I've been checkmated,"" I replied, my voice barely above a whisper.
And with that, Magnus sealed my fate, lost in a game of passion and love.

I‚Äôm sorry if this breaks the rules but this crossed my mind recently and i‚Äôve honestly been at a loss and need some advice. :( My mom is my legal guardian and is the only legal guardian in the household.

I guess the first question is like to start off with is if staying in a small room for 20 days straight is normal. I know it sounds bizarre but that has honestly been my reality for months now. I‚Äôm rarely granted the chance to leave my house and whenever i am able to it‚Äôs either for menial errands or whatever boring thing my mom wants me to do. I call it boring because it‚Äôs either going to the store or  to a random relatives house (trust me, it‚Äôs not as fun as you‚Äôd think.) I would just sit on the couch, almost lifeless and tired as she talks to her relative and chatters. That‚Äôs it 


that has legitimately been my reality (like i‚Äôve said before) for years. We never do any fun activities. It‚Äôs just errands ‚Äî> back to my personal jailed hell. I don‚Äôt remember the last time i‚Äôve  ever went out and about and laughed, had fun, did something, just anything. I‚Äôm swear to god i‚Äôm not lying. 

She‚Äôs always gone. And because the other residents got the keys, i‚Äôm legimateky inable to leave my house. (Because there is nobody able to lock the door.) Let get into my room. It‚Äôs a small twin bed with a. small window and a closet. It‚Äôs a really small room. 23 hours a day im laying on my bed. I barely eat.


This has led me to garner really bad vision. I went from near perfect eyesight to pretty bad eyesight. I cannot read anything clearly maybe a hand away from my face.


This isolation has left me with zero friends. I‚Äôve lived like this for about 6-ish years now. I‚Äôve never went to prom. I‚Äôve never been enrolled into any fun activities as a child. When i scroll through insta stories and see people going to coffee shops, hanging out in carnivals, or just going to a museum, i want to cry. I wonder what it‚Äôs like. I‚Äôve never done anything a normal teenager would have. I have told her my feelings and i do believe that she does understand a bit but she‚Äôs glued to her phone a like moth to a flame. 

Im so hungry. All of the time. I don‚Äôt remember the last time i‚Äôve eaten breakfast, or dinner. Last night I ate a small bowl of mash potatoes. That‚Äôs all for the entire day. My depression and fatigue just gets really bad and i stay in my bed when there are days where there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a ton of options: like If there is it‚Äôs just menial fruit and bunch of condiments that don‚Äôt go together. I watch a lot of mukbang videos alone and stuff because i just crave a full meal sometimes (i kinda feel myself getting emotional typing this.) But it‚Äôs true..

Sometimes when i get really sleepy i wonder if she‚Äôs even aware that her daughter has been in her room for almost a month  straight 

I miss being young especially before the pandemic because even though i‚Äôd stay home usually for 2 weeks straight, i‚Äôd have the ability for her to take me to the park and sometimes i could interact with the other kids there and i could fell the sun and touch the grass and play for an entire day and it was just so beautiful.

Coffee tables are not just functional furniture pieces; they serve as a focal point in living rooms, setting the tone for your home‚Äôs d√©cor. While buying a pre-made coffee table might seem like the simplest option, there's something special about building your own. Woodworking allows you to create a piece that perfectly suits your style, needs, and space.

DIY woodworking projects offer a sense of accomplishment and the opportunity to craft custom designs, whether you‚Äôre a seasoned woodworker or just starting out. Building your own coffee table lets you experiment with different woods, finishes, and designs to create a truly unique item. Plus, it‚Äôs a cost-effective alternative to purchasing a mass-produced table.

In this guide, we‚Äôll take you through everything you need to know about crafting your own coffee table‚Äîfrom planning the design to choosing materials, tools, and finishes. By the end of this guide, you‚Äôll be equipped to tackle your woodworking project and create a stunning coffee table that complements your home.

# 2. Planning Your Coffee Table Project

Before jumping into the woodworking process, it‚Äôs essential to plan your coffee table project. This phase is crucial as it helps avoid mistakes down the line and ensures your table will fit perfectly in your space.

# Defining the Purpose of Your Coffee Table

Coffee tables come in various forms, and each serves a different purpose. Some are primarily functional, and designed for holding drinks, books, or remote controls. Others serve as storage tables, offering hidden compartments for magazines or blankets. Some are more decorative, designed to showcase your personal style with intricate designs or unique materials.

Decide on the primary function of your coffee table. Do you need extra storage space? Would you prefer a minimalist design? Answering these questions will guide your decisions on size, shape, and features.

# Assessing Available Space

Measure the space where you plan to place the coffee table. The ideal coffee table size should be proportional to the furniture around it. For example, a table that is too large may overwhelm a small seating area, while a table that is too small might look lost in a spacious room.

# Design Sketching

Once you have your measurements, sketch your design. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a professional blueprint, but a simple drawing will help you visualize the project and make adjustments before cutting any wood.

# Choosing the Style

Whether you lean toward modern, rustic, industrial, or Scandinavian styles, selecting a design that complements your existing furniture will create a cohesive look. You can search online for inspiration, or if you‚Äôre feeling creative, sketch out your own unique style.

# 3. Tools and Equipment Needed

To complete your coffee table project, you‚Äôll need a range of tools, from basic hand tools to more specialized equipment. Here‚Äôs a list of the essential tools you‚Äôll need:

# Essential Tools for Woodworking

* **Saw**: A circular saw, miter saw, or jigsaw will allow you to cut your wood to size.
* **Drill**: You‚Äôll need a power drill for drilling holes for screws and attaching hardware.
* **Sander**: A hand sander or orbital sander will help smooth out rough surfaces.
* **Clamps**: To hold your pieces in place while the glue dries.
* **Measuring Tape**: For accurate measurements.

# Optional Tools

* **Jigsaw**: For more intricate cuts or rounded corners.
* **Router**: For adding decorative edges to your table.
* **Circular Saw**: A great tool for straight cuts in large pieces of wood.

# Safety Gear

* **Goggles and Safety Glasses**: To protect your eyes from flying debris.

# 4. Selecting Materials for Your Coffee Table

Choosing the right materials for your coffee table is key to both its durability and aesthetic appeal. The materials you select will not only influence the table's look but also its functionality and longevity.

# Types of Wood: Hardwood vs. Softwood

There are two main categories of wood used in woodworking: hardwood and softwood. Both types have distinct characteristics that make them suitable for different applications.

* **Hardwood**: Hardwoods, like oak, walnut, and maple, are dense and durable. They tend to be more expensive but offer greater strength and an elegant finish. Hardwoods are ideal for coffee tables, as they can withstand daily use and heavy objects.
* **Softwood**: Softwoods like pine, cedar, and fir are easier to work with and less expensive. While they are less dense than hardwoods, they still make excellent choices for DIY projects, especially for simpler, rustic designs.

# Best Wood Types for Coffee Tables

* **Oak**: Known for its strength and attractive grain, oak is a popular choice for coffee tables. It‚Äôs available in different varieties, such as red and white oak, which offer slightly different color tones.
* **Maple**: Maple is a dense, strong wood with a fine grain. It takes stain well and is ideal for tables that will undergo heavy use.
* **Walnut**: Walnut is a premium hardwood, famous for its rich, dark color and elegant grain patterns. It‚Äôs perfect for a high-end, luxury look.
* **Pine**: A budget-friendly option, pine has a light color and a rustic appearance. It‚Äôs easy to work with, making it a great choice for beginner woodworkers.

# Other Materials

While wood is the primary material for most coffee tables, you can mix it with other materials to create a unique design:

* **Glass**: A glass tabletop can provide a sleek, modern look. It pairs well with wooden or metal bases for an industrial or minimalist style.
* **Metal**: Incorporating metal legs or accents can add an industrial touch to your coffee table. Steel, iron, and brass are all popular options.
* **Alternative Woods**: For an eco-friendly option, consider reclaimed or salvaged wood. It adds a rustic charm while promoting sustainability.

# Choosing Finishes and Stains

The finish you choose will affect the final appearance of your coffee table and protect the wood. Here are some popular options:

* **Stain**: Staining enhances the natural color and grain of the wood. Choose a light stain for a more rustic look or a dark stain for a rich, elegant finish.
* **Paint**: Painting the coffee table can add a pop of color or give it a more modern, uniform appearance.
* **Polyurethane**: A clear polyurethane finish adds a glossy layer of protection and enhances the wood‚Äôs natural look.

# 5. Step-by-Step Guide to Building a Simple Coffee Table

Now that you‚Äôve selected your materials and tools, it‚Äôs time to begin the process of constructing your coffee table. Follow these steps to create a sturdy and attractive piece.

# Step 1: Cutting the Wood to Size

Start by measuring and marking the dimensions of your coffee table pieces. You‚Äôll need four legs, a base frame, and a tabletop. Use a saw (circular or miter saw) to cut the wood to the proper lengths. Always measure twice and cut once to ensure accuracy.

# Step 2: Assembling the Base Frame

The base frame is the foundation of your table. Begin by attaching the legs to the frame using wood screws and wood glue. Make sure the joints are square, and use clamps to hold everything in place while the glue dries.

# Step 3: Attaching the Tabletop

Once the base is secure, it‚Äôs time to attach the tabletop. If you're using a solid wood piece, simply attach it to the base with screws. If you‚Äôre using a glass or metal top, you may need additional hardware like brackets or supports.

# Step 4: Sanding and Smoothing the Edges

Sanding is essential for achieving a smooth surface. Use a hand sander or orbital sander to smooth out any rough edges, joints, and surfaces. Start with a coarse grit sandpaper and gradually move to finer grits to achieve a flawless finish.

# Step 5: Staining or Painting the Table

After sanding, it‚Äôs time to add your desired finish. Apply wood stain or paint evenly, following the grain of the wood. Allow the stain to dry completely before applying a protective layer of polyurethane to ensure the table is durable and resistant to wear and tear.

# 6. Advanced Coffee Table Designs

Once you‚Äôve mastered the basics of building a simple coffee table, you can take your woodworking skills to the next level by incorporating more complex designs and features.

# Creating Intricate Designs

If you want to create a more decorative piece, consider adding features such as:

* **Drawer Tables**: Incorporating hidden drawers into your coffee table provides additional storage space. This is ideal for keeping remote controls, magazines, and other small items out of sight.
* **Foldable Coffee Tables**: A foldable design can be a functional option for small spaces. You can build a table that folds down to a smaller size when not in use or expands to accommodate guests.

# Using Reclaimed Wood for a Rustic Look

Reclaimed wood adds character and texture to your coffee table. It's also an eco-friendly option. Look for old wooden pallets, barn doors, or vintage furniture to repurpose the wood into something new.

# Decorative Elements

You can further enhance the visual appeal of your coffee table by incorporating decorative elements such as:

* **Inlays**: Add intricate patterns using different types of wood or even metal pieces for an eye-catching effect.
* **Carving**: If you‚Äôre feeling particularly creative, try carving detailed designs or patterns into the tabletop to add a personalized touch.

# 7. Safety Considerations in Woodworking

Safety should always be a top priority when woodworking. Here are some key safety guidelines to follow during your coffee table project:

* **Work in a Well-Ventilated Area**: Sawdust and fumes from paints or finishes can be harmful. Always work in a space with good airflow, and wear a dust mask when sanding or cutting wood.
* **Handle Power Tools with Care**: Always read the manuals for your tools and ensure you understand how to use them correctly. Never bypass safety features, and make sure the tools are in good working condition.
* **Keep Your Workspace Organized**: A cluttered workspace can lead to accidents. Keep tools, wood, and materials organized and within easy reach to prevent unnecessary movements while working.

# 8. Common Mistakes to Avoid in Coffee Table Construction

Even experienced woodworkers make mistakes during their projects. By understanding these common pitfalls, you can avoid frustration and achieve better results.

# Miscalculating Wood Measurements

Accurate measurements are the foundation of any woodworking project. One of the most common mistakes is miscalculating the size of the tabletop or legs, leading to mismatched parts or an unbalanced table. Always double-check your measurements before cutting, and take time to plan the layout carefully.

# Overlooking Wood Grain and Texture

The grain and texture of the wood can significantly affect the final look of your coffee table. It's essential to consider the wood grain‚Äôs direction and how the stain or finish will highlight or obscure it. For instance, cutting against the grain can result in rough surfaces that are hard to smooth out.

# Not Accounting for Drying Time

Whether you‚Äôre gluing parts together or applying finishes, drying time is crucial. Rushing the process can result in weak joints or a finish that isn't properly cured, leading to peeling or staining. Make sure to allow enough time for each phase to dry before moving on to the next step.

# Skipping Sanding

Sanding may seem like a tedious task, but it‚Äôs essential for a smooth, professional finish. Skipping this step or rushing through it will leave visible rough spots, which can detract from the overall quality of your table. Take your time and sand thoroughly at each stage.

# 9. Finishing Techniques for Coffee Tables

A proper finish not only enhances the look of your coffee table but also ensures its longevity. Here are some common finishing techniques to consider:

# Staining and Painting Options

* **Wood Stains**: Staining is ideal for enhancing the natural beauty of the wood grain while adding color. Choose a light stain for a natural look or a dark stain for a more sophisticated appearance. Apply the stain evenly, working with the wood grain.
* **Painting**: If you prefer a uniform, modern look, painting your coffee table is a great option. Consider using a durable furniture paint or chalk paint for a matte, vintage finish. Don't forget to apply a protective topcoat after painting.

# Applying a Protective Finish

After staining or painting your coffee table, it's important to apply a protective finish. Here are some popular options:

* **Polyurethane**: A polyurethane finish offers a glossy, durable coat that protects the wood from spills and scratches. It‚Äôs ideal for coffee tables that will see heavy use.
* **Lacquer**: Lacquer provides a high-gloss finish that dries quickly. It‚Äôs great for creating a sleek, modern look.
* **Wax**: Wax finishes provide a soft, satin sheen. They‚Äôre less durable than polyurethane but are perfect for creating a vintage or antique look.

# Tips for a Smooth Finish

* Sand between coats of stain or paint to remove imperfections and ensure a smooth surface.
* Apply thin, even layers to avoid drips and streaks.
* Allow each coat to dry thoroughly before applying the next one to achieve the best results.

# 10. Creative Ideas and Customization Options

Once you‚Äôve mastered the basics of woodworking, you can take your coffee table to the next level by adding creative design elements. Here are some ideas to make your coffee table truly unique:

# Mixing Materials

Experiment with mixing different materials, such as wood and metal, for a modern, industrial look. For example, combine a wood tabletop with steel legs or a reclaimed wood surface with glass inlays.

# Incorporating Storage

For added functionality, design your coffee table with built-in storage. Hidden drawers or a shelf underneath the tabletop are perfect for storing books, magazines, or remote controls. This is especially useful in small living spaces.

# Using Live Edge Wood

Live edge wood, which retains the natural contours of the tree, creates a beautiful, organic look. It works particularly well for rustic or bohemian-style coffee tables. Each piece of live edge wood is unique, adding character and charm to your table.

# Metal Accents

Adding metal elements, such as decorative hardware, rivets, or metal legs, can transform a simple wooden table into a stylish statement piece. Whether you‚Äôre going for an industrial vibe or something more contemporary, metal accents add strength and sophistication.

# Glass Tabletops

A glass tabletop can be an elegant choice, particularly when paired with wooden or metal bases. Glass creates a sleek, modern look and allows the natural beauty of the base materials to take center stage. Additionally, a glass top is easy to clean and maintain.

# 11. Maintenance Tips for Your Coffee Table

To ensure your coffee table lasts for years to come, regular maintenance is essential. Here are some tips for keeping your table in top condition:

# Caring for Different Types of Finishes

* **Wooden Finishes**: Dust your table regularly to avoid buildup. For tables with polyurethane or lacquer finishes, wipe them down with a soft cloth. For waxed finishes, reapply the wax every 6 to 12 months.
* **Painted Finishes**: Painted tables can accumulate scuffs or chips. Touch up any areas that show signs of wear to keep the table looking fresh. Use a matching paint or a clear coat to protect the paint.

# Preventing Scratches and Dents

Place coasters, placemats, or tablecloths on the coffee table to protect it from hot cups or heavy objects. For wood tables, avoid dragging items across the surface, as this can cause scratches. Consider adding felt pads to the bottom of decorative items to prevent damage.

# Regular Cleaning

To clean your coffee table, use a gentle cleaner that‚Äôs safe for wood, paint, or glass (depending on the materials). Avoid harsh chemicals that could damage the surface. For glass tops, use a streak-free glass cleaner.

1i4vn1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1i4vn1o/is_my_mom_neglectful/,Is my mom neglectful? ,"(19f)

I‚Äôm sorry if this breaks the rules but this crossed my mind recently and i‚Äôve honestly been at a loss and need some advice. :( My mom is my legal guardian and is the only legal guardian in the household. I‚Äôm the second youngest of my six  siblings. Six of which that are constantly at work and hog the household keys. I‚Äôll get into ‚Äúhogging the keys‚Äù in a minute because it is a key part of this story. 


I guess the first question is like to start off with is if staying in a small room for 20 days straight is normal. I know it sounds bizarre but that has honestly been my reality for months now. I‚Äôm rarely granted the chance to leave my house and whenever i am able to it‚Äôs either for menial errands or whatever boring thing my mom wants me to do. I call it boring because it‚Äôs either going to the store or  to a random relatives house (trust me, it‚Äôs not as fun as you‚Äôd think.) I would just sit on the couch, almost lifeless and tired as she talks to her relative and chatters. That‚Äôs it 


that has legitimately been my reality (like i‚Äôve said before) for years. We never do any fun activities. It‚Äôs just errands ‚Äî> back to my personal jailed hell. I don‚Äôt remember the last time i‚Äôve  ever went out and about and laughed, had fun, did something, just anything. I‚Äôm swear to god i‚Äôm not lying. 

She‚Äôs always gone. And because the other residents got the keys, i‚Äôm legimateky inable to leave my house. (Because there is nobody able to lock the door.) Let get into my room. It‚Äôs a small twin bed with a. small window and a closet. It‚Äôs a really small room. 23 hours a day im laying on my bed. I barely eat.


This has led me to garner really bad vision. I went from near perfect eyesight to pretty bad eyesight. I cannot read anything clearly maybe a hand away from my face.


This isolation has left me with zero friends. I‚Äôve lived like this for about 6-ish years now. I‚Äôve never went to prom. I‚Äôve never been enrolled into any fun activities as a child. When i scroll through insta stories and see people going to coffee shops, hanging out in carnivals, or just going to a museum, i want to cry. I wonder what it‚Äôs like. I‚Äôve never done anything a normal teenager would have. I have told her my feelings and i do believe that she does understand a bit but she‚Äôs glued to her phone a like moth to a flame. 

Im so hungry. All of the time. I don‚Äôt remember the last time i‚Äôve eaten breakfast, or dinner. Last night I ate a small bowl of mash potatoes. That‚Äôs all for the entire day. My depression and fatigue just gets really bad and i stay in my bed when there are days where there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a ton of options: like If there is it‚Äôs just menial fruit and bunch of condiments that don‚Äôt go together. I watch a lot of mukbang videos alone and stuff because i just crave a full meal sometimes (i kinda feel myself getting emotional typing this.) But it‚Äôs true.. 

I‚Äôve told her how i‚Äôve felt, even broken down and cried about wanting to end it all but the next day, she just acts normal and whenever i‚Äôm crying in my pillow ‚Äî i hear her and my other siblings in the kitchen laughing and having fun and i feel like an outsider ailen who‚Äôs crazy.

Sometimes when i get really sleepy i wonder if she‚Äôs even aware that her daughter has been in her room for almost a month  straight 

I miss being young especially before the pandemic because even though i‚Äôd stay home usually for 2 weeks straight, i‚Äôd have the ability for her to take me to the park and sometimes i could interact with the other kids there and i could fell the sun and touch the grass and play for an entire day and it was just so beautiful. I feel so pathetic because i feel like that‚Äôs a basic human right but it‚Äôs so foreign to me at this point 

I am aware that i an legal adult and i am in the process of getting my listened so hopefully i will be able to own a car and go out finally and do things that i‚Äôd like, but staying in my jail for so long (my small ass room lol) i kind of lose my perception of time and stuff since i spend a lot of time in here

1i4vja2,https://i.redd.it/o6boxxtkfxde1.jpeg,Trainer buying experience in Cork. Here‚Äôs a boring story to enjoy with your Sunday morning coffee.,"After a loyal 2 years in the gym, my Nike‚Äôs finally gave up. Not bad for an ‚Ç¨90 pair of trainers that I‚Äôve worn virtually daily. I‚Äôm by no means a trainer expert, but wanted something comfortable.

Popped down to Mahon Point - feck me, what an absolute nightmare of a place.

First up: Lifestyle Sports. Hardly any availability of size 10 men‚Äôs running shoes, staff uninterested and generally a chaotic shopping ambience. ‚ÄúIf we havent got it on the shelf, we don‚Äôt stock it‚Äù being the phrase parroted by the staff.

Next up: Sports Direct. Ok-ish variety of trainers at a good price, however next to impossible to find a member of staff to get the desired size to try on. Got forgotten about twice. Security guard chasing the usual troublemakers around the shop‚Ä¶..then I saw the colossal queue and gave up. It really is a complete dump in utter disarray. 

Thirdly - The Edge on Kinsale Road. It may be small, but wow - what fantastic customer service. Spoke with one of the lads and explained what I was looking for - he asked me a few more questions and appeared with a variety of trainers in my size and talked me through the benefits of each.

In the end I bought these Hoka‚Äôs - hands down the most comfortable shoes I‚Äôve ever worn, like walking on clouds.

Good old fashioned customer service - I 10% off for joining their loyalty scheme too. Great!
