1jr1qga,https://www.reddit.com/r/NutriBullet/comments/1jr1qga/using_us_nutribullet_nb91301k_in_japan/,Using US Nutribullet NB9-1301K in Japan,"I have been visiting my sister in the US and she has a Nutribullet blender and I commented on how great it was, and she surprised me today with one she ordered online for me to take back to Japan.

Japan uses the same plug outlet as the US, and the part of Japan I am in is 60Hz like the US, however the voltage is lower (100V vs 120V)

Given it's a gift I don't want to turn it down (and it would also obviously be great to have a free blender) but I was to be sure it's fine to use in Japan.

The specs on her blender (I haven't opened the box of the new one,  in case I need to return it) don't give a voltage range (just specify 120V with no wiggle room) and the photos of the bottom of Japanese nutribullets specific 100V 50Hz/60Hz compatible. Nutibullet's website and PDFs for the model in question don't have technical information about the voltage range the appliance has been engineered for, and predictably just give a big warning not to use in a region with a different electrical standard under any circumstances.

Intuitively, stepping down in voltage should be safe in my mind as it should mean they are just operating at a lower power. However, I also know - from having experience with coffee grinders - that appliances with motors often have to be carefully calibrated, especially when dealing with resistive torques, so being under powered may be an issue if some parts of the electronics are expecting the motor to be delivering more power than it actually is.

Does anyone have any experience of taking a nutribullet blender from the USA to Japan, (or is someone a blender/electronics engineer) who can help advise?",1,1743735284.0,NutriBullet,0,1.0,False

I was cleaning my counter this morning. I decided to lift my Nespresso vertuo plus off of the counter so I could clean underneath it.

There doesn‚Äôt appear to be any visual damage.

I tried resetting it and tried running a cleaning cycle and nothing works there either.  

My machine is just over three years old. Is there a place that I could take it to be looked at? I remember when I used to live in New York City there was a Nespresso store but now that I live a couple hours from New York City there isn‚Äôt one near me.  Is there like a place that does this?

Android Auto 14.0 Hints at a Major Shift!,"The recent buzz around Android Auto 14.0 hints at a significant evolution in how we interact with our vehicles, especially with the potential arrival of Google Gemini. As someone who‚Äôs always on the lookout for ways to enhance the driving experience, the integration of advanced AI like Gemini could be a game changer. Imagine having a personal assistant that not only understands your preferences but also adapts to your driving habits in real-time!

With Gemini, the potential for seamless voice commands and smarter navigation is incredibly exciting. Think about it: no more fumbling with your phone or trying to decipher complicated menus while you‚Äôre on the road. Instead, you could just ask your car to find the fastest route or even suggest a great coffee shop based on your usual stops. This kind of intuitive technology could really transform our commutes into more enjoyable experiences.

Moreover, the safety implications are significant. Enhanced AI could help reduce distractions by allowing drivers to control functions through simple voice interactions. This means keeping your eyes on the road while still accessing all the features that modern cars offer.

As we wait for this update, it feels like we‚Äôre on the brink of a tech revolution in our vehicles. The thought of having a smart, responsive system like Gemini integrated into our cars is thrilling. It could redefine what we expect from our in-car experience and set a new standard for automotive technology. What are your thoughts? Are you as excited about this potential shift as I am?",1,1743734762.0,hacksguider,0,1.0,False

1jr1jz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1jr1jz1/the_whispers_in_the_stack/,The Whispers in the Stack,"Not sure where to start, the fact I have no memory of the last few months and certainly no memory of writing three entry logs about my new job, this whole thing is strange, and I'm not sure what to do at this point; I mean, they were on my laptop with the post-it note. All the evidence I have found so far is my laptop and a post it note in my handwriting; only it seems I wrote it in a panic or a state of delirium. Letters are cursive variants but upside down for some reason; nevertheless, from what I could tell, it said, ""The Whispers in the Stack, See. Know. Become.‚Äù If anyone can help me find out who or what did this to me.

**First Entry: The Night Shift**

I never expected much from a night security job‚Äîjust a paycheck to keep the lights on. The Eldridge Archive sits on the edge of town, a squat, weathered building stuffed with historical records no one bothers to read anymore. It‚Äôs the kind of place that feels like it‚Äôs waiting to be forgotten, its narrow halls and towering shelves bathed in the faint hum of flickering fluorescents. The air smells of moldy paper and something sharp, like old ink gone sour. I took the gig because my wife, Sarah, works days at the hospital, and we‚Äôve got a mortgage breathing down our necks. It‚Äôs dull work: walk the perimeter, check the locks, and make sure nothing‚Äôs out of place. Simple. My third night on the job, though, something shifted. I was in the east wing‚Äîthe oldest part of the archive, where the shadows cling a little too long and the air turns cold enough to prickle your skin. A sound stopped me mid-step: a whisper, so soft I thought it was a draft sneaking through the walls. I held my breath, listening. There it was again‚Äîa faint murmur, like someone reading just beyond the shelves. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I called, my voice swallowed by the silence. The only reply was the groan of the floorboards settling. I shook it off. Old buildings creak, right? But as I turned to move on, my flashlight caught something‚Äîa small, leather-bound book lying on the floor, half-tucked under a shelf. It hadn‚Äôt been there before; I‚Äôd swear to it. The cover was cracked with age, and inside, the title page read, Logbook, 1937. I flipped through it‚Äîstandard stuff about archive upkeep‚Äîuntil one line snagged my attention: ‚ÄúThe watcher in the margins grows restless.‚Äù It sounded like a prank, some bored clerk‚Äôs scribble. I pocketed it anyway, a weird itch of curiosity tugging at me. When I got home that morning, I slept fine. But that whisper‚Äîit stuck with me, a quiet echo I couldn‚Äôt shake.

**Second Entry: \~The Unraveling\~**

A week in, and the whispers weren‚Äôt just background noise anymore. They followed me through the stacks, faint but persistent, like a conversation I was never meant to hear. I started carrying a recorder, hoping to catch something concrete, but all I got was static laced with the building‚Äôs creaks. Sarah noticed the change first. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not sleeping,‚Äù she said one morning, sliding a coffee mug across the counter. Her eyes were tired and worried. ‚ÄúThis job‚Äôs getting to you.‚Äù She wasn‚Äôt wrong‚ÄîI felt like I was running on fumes‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt just exhaustion. The archive was wrong somehow. One night, I found a map on a reading table in the main hall. It wasn‚Äôt there an hour before. The paper was brittle, the ink faded, but it showed a place called Eldritch Hollow‚Äîa town I‚Äôd never heard of, its streets coiling into impossible knots. I folded it up, shelved it, and moved on. When I checked later, it was gone. Then there was the diary: a thin, warped volume I pulled from a box dated October 31, 2025‚Äîthree years from now. The handwriting was jagged, ranting about a ‚Äúgreat awakening‚Äù and ‚Äúeyes that see through time.‚Äù My pulse hammered as I read it. The next night, I went back to check it again. The pages were blank. Home wasn‚Äôt much better. Sarah and I started fighting‚Äîabout bills, about how I‚Äôd stare through her like she wasn‚Äôt there. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not yourself,‚Äù she snapped one evening, her voice cracking. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt even know you anymore.‚Äù I wanted to tell her about the whispers, the documents, but the words stuck in my throat. She‚Äôd think I was losing it. Maybe I was. Then the dreams started. Vast, unblinking eyes hovering in an endless void, watching me. They peeled me apart, layer by layer, until I woke gasping, drenched in sweat. The whispers lingered, louder now, threading through my skull.

**Final Entry: \~\~The Descent\~\~**

I couldn‚Äôt keep going like this. The whispers had teeth now, sharp little words I could almost grasp‚Äî‚ÄúSee. Know. Become.‚Äù They didn‚Äôt stop at the archive anymore; they trailed me home, buzzing in my ears even in daylight. Sleep was a lost cause‚ÄîI‚Äôd close my eyes and see those endless eyes staring back. My hands wouldn‚Äôt stop shaking, and food turned to ash in my mouth. Sarah left a note one morning: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm staying with my sister. I can‚Äôt do this anymore.‚Äù The house felt emptier without her, but I couldn‚Äôt muster the energy to care. I had to end it. On my last shift, I went straight for the restricted section‚Äîa locked wing I‚Äôd never bothered with before. The key trembled in my hand as I opened the door. Inside, the air was heavy, pressing down like wet cloth, and the shelves were packed with strange, leathery books that seemed to hum under my touch. The whispers exploded, a chorus of overlapping voices clawing at my brain. At the end of the aisle stood a pedestal, an open book on it. The pages writhed with symbols that twisted and pulsed, glowing a sickly green. I couldn‚Äôt look away. Something moved behind me‚Äîa blur, like ink bleeding across paper. I spun around, but the aisle was empty, the shadows bending in ways that defied reason. My chest tightened, breath coming in ragged bursts. I ran, the whispers shrieking after me, my boots pounding the floor until I stumbled out the front doors and into my car. I didn‚Äôt stop driving until dawn. I quit that morning, sending an email from a coffee shop because I couldn‚Äôt face going back. I told myself it was over. But it‚Äôs not. Sitting here in my living room, the lights off and the silence thick, I still hear them‚Äîthe whispers. They‚Äôre soft, barely there, but they dig into me. Sometimes, in the dark, I catch a flicker in the corner of my eye‚Äîa smear of shadow that doesn‚Äôt belong. I tell myself it‚Äôs nothing, that I‚Äôm just tired. But I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs real anymore. Maybe I never did.

Intrepid Adventurers to join Oreloc‚Äôs newest adventuring guild! Are you a skilled warrior, mage, or rogue? Do you thirst for gold and glory? Then we want you! Tryouts this Saturday. NO BARDS.*

¬†

I nailed that add, and it only took two hours to write. It‚Äôs funny how the words just flow out of you when you know you‚Äôre doing something right. My parents thought this was a stupid idea. Why would anyone want to join my guild when they could drive into Castleton and sign up with one of the major guilds and make some serious questing money? They didn‚Äôt get it. Everyone knew that the big boys in the city started off small, just like I was doing. Give it a couple of years, I said, and I‚Äôll be set up in a nice cushy office, surrounded by treasure. Maybe I‚Äôd even get my name in the paper. I had big dreams, but first I needed a team.

I got my sister, Polk, to draw a picture of a half-orc (me, obviously), ripping the head off a goblin and spewing his guts all over the ground. I had to give her five gold pieces, and even then, needed to go back and add some extra blood‚Äîshe never does enough‚Äîbut when it was done, I had the perfect flyer. I used my dad‚Äôs Arcane Personal Scriptor to print off thirty copies and hung them all over town. Oreloc‚Äôs a suburb of Castleton and there are plenty of people around‚Äîorcs, fairies, gnomes, even a few dwarves‚Äîso I knew I‚Äôd get a good turnout. The elves live up in the Heights, where the mansions are, and I didn‚Äôt expect any of them to show up, but I didn‚Äôt need them anyway. An elf on the team would only make things more annoying.

Saturday morning came, and I was a wreck. I‚Äôd claimed the basement rumpus room as my tryout space and pushed all the furniture against the wall. The carpet was nailed down so there wasn‚Äôt much I could do about that, but I‚Äôd be sure no one got any blood anywhere. By nine o‚Äôclock, I was ready. Since the tryout didn‚Äôt start for another hour, my mom called me upstairs and forced me to have breakfast. I told her was too excited to eat but you know moms.

‚ÄúHave some eggs and toast, Grik. All of your little friends will have eaten breakfast. You don‚Äôt want to be starving when everyone else is full, do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not my friends, mom. They‚Äôre going to be my employees. I‚Äôm starting a business, here.‚Äù

‚ÄúEmployees, sorry. Do you want six eggs or seven?‚Äù

‚ÄúSeven please.‚Äù

She cracked them into the skillet and threw a loaf of bread in the toaster. My mom was human, but she understood the orc diet better than most people I knew. Even though I‚Äôd never seen her eat more than three plates of food at a time, she always made sure we, my dad, sister and I, had fifth helpings of everything. She was good that way.

My dad came in, dressed for yard work. During the week, he was an accountant in Castleton. He worked in the gold reserve at the palace. I didn‚Äôt know exactly what he did, something with conversion rates, but it required him to wear a tie and keep his tusks shiny. Today, he was dressed down in shorts and boat shoes. We had a nice house with the manicured lawn and two cars in the garage, and my mom always said how lucky we were that my dad had such a good job. That might have been true, but it was also so boring. Whenever he talked about his job, I would start to fall asleep.

I wanted adventure, danger, glory! I‚Äôd been asking for a battle ax for as long as I could remember, but my parents said that I had to wait until I was eighteen. That was two years away, a lifetime for an adventurer like me. In the meantime, I had turned an old baseball bat into a club. I‚Äôd even carved some runic symbols into it to make it more powerful. I didn‚Äôt know if they did anything, but I‚Äôd hit plenty of stuff and the bat was still in one piece, so something was working.

Mom slid a trey of eggs and half a loaf of bread in front of me and I gobbled them down as fast as I could. My sister rolled her eyes at me, but I didn‚Äôt care. Today was the start of *Adventurers, Inc.* The first step to being a real hero.

I finished, belched, and threw my plate into the sink.

‚ÄúCan I go get ready now?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes dear,‚Äù mom said. ‚ÄúYou can go play with your friends, now.‚Äù

‚ÄúMom! I told you they‚Äôre employees, not friends.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think you‚Äôre getting a little in over your head,‚Äù my dad said. He was reading the morning paper and sipping coffee. Mom slid a trey in front of him‚Äîfifteen eggs and two loaves of bread‚Äîand he set the paper down before shoveling the food into his mouth. When he finished, he burped loud enough to rattle the silver wear and patted his stomach. ‚ÄúGreat breakfast, Barb, thank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome my love. And I have to agree with your dad, Grik. Starting a business is a big deal, especially at your age. Don‚Äôt you want to be out riding your bike or playing baseball or doing something normal?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got your whole life to work, pal,‚Äù dad said. ‚ÄúIt sneaks up on you faster than you think. Trust me, I know.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd adventuring is such a hard life. Inconsistent, no insurance. And forget about retirement. I know you don‚Äôt want to be an accountant like your father but‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll never sit behind a desk,‚Äù I said, picking up my bat, which I had named Balinda after a gladiator I‚Äôd seen on the crystal ball one night after my parents had gone to sleep. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an adventurer. Its who I am. Dad crunches numbers. I crunch skulls.‚Äù

Polk exploded in giggles at that, spraying egg all over the table and then started choaking, which was exactly what she deserved. It was also my cue to leave.

‚ÄúPeople should start showing up any minute. Can you tell them to start a line in the hallway and I‚Äôll see them one at a time in the basement.

‚ÄúBut sweetheart‚Ä¶‚Äù mom said as she slammed her tiny human hand into Polk‚Äôs back. ‚ÄúI really think...‚Äù

‚ÄúMom, just be cool, alright. It‚Äôs going to work out.‚Äù I disappeared into the basement, my imagination filled with images of who I was going to see. A grizzled warlock who‚Äôd made an evil pact for unlimited power? A monk, silent but deadly, who could level the house with one empty hand? Maybe a paladin clad in silver armor, his holy sword slung over his back and the crest of his god seared onto his breastplate. Or a rogue, although no real rogue would use the front door. They‚Äôd just show up in the basement with me, hopefully with a knife to my throat. The possibilities were endless, and I stifled a squeal of excitement as I sat behind my examiner‚Äôs card table, note pad ready and Balinda leaning comfortingly against my leg.

\*\*\*

Two hours later, I stomped back upstairs, some of my excitement trickling away. No one had shown up, yet. I didn‚Äôt understand it. I put the date and time on the flyer, I know I did. Did I forget the address? No, I quadruple checked to make sure all the details were right before I ran the copies off on Dad‚Äôs APS-940. I knew I‚Äôd put up enough flyers. Mainstreet was plastered with them. I‚Äôd even put a few south of the tracks, thinking maybe I‚Äôd get a dwarf or two looking for extra work. But nothing. Something wasn‚Äôt right.

‚ÄúMom!‚Äù I shouted. Balinda was in my hand, and I tapped her against the countertop as I waited. Mom was upstairs folding laundry. Outside, dad was on his knees weeding the garden. His massive arms were almost ripping the sleeves of his blue polo shirt. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd ever have arms like that. I was only a half-orc, and the half of me that was human was still a little scrawny. I needed to eat more eggs or something, but I could worry about that later. I had more pressing things on my mind.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong sweetheart?‚Äù Mom said, coming into the kitchen.

‚ÄúHas anyone shown up?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one has come by looking for my guild tryouts? Maybe someone you didn‚Äôt recognize and turned away? Anyone?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs come, hon. And I know what all of your friends look like. I‚Äôd never ask them to leave.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not my‚Ä¶never mind. Somethings going on. Why isn‚Äôt anyone here?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre a level 1 loser, that‚Äôs why!‚Äù My sister was at the top of the stairs, with her hands on her hips. She had leg warmers on and a green scrunchy wrapped into her hair. ‚ÄúNoone wants to be in your stupid loser‚Äôs guild.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up, pig face.‚Äù

‚ÄúTroll.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough you two.‚Äù Mom was a good two feet shorter than me and Polk, but she could shut us up when she needed to. Polk skipped down the stairs, suddenly the perfect daughter.

‚ÄúMommy, I‚Äôm going to the mall with Nayak and a few of the girls. Is that alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course it is. Have fun. Say high to everyone for me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will. Love you.‚Äù She stuck her tongue out at me as she skipped to the door, mouthing *bye looser* before slamming it behind her.

There was no way Polk was right. My flyer was gold. If I had seen it on the street, I‚Äôd have picked up Balinda and run straight over. Something was keeping all of the adventurers away, I just didn‚Äôt know what. Was every hero in Oreloc already guilded up? No, that didn‚Äôt make sense. There were plenty of independent contractors out there. Maybe there weren‚Äôt enough guts coming out of the dismembered goblin‚Ä¶

There was a knock at the door, and I jumped, wheeling Balinda around.

‚ÄúWill you put that thing away before you break something?‚Äù Mom said. Outside, dad peeked his head around the corner and raised his massive eyebrows. That was a good sign. Dad was an accountant so there wasn‚Äôt much that interested him.

‚ÄúAn adventurer,‚Äù I said. I had to suppress another squeal of excitement. Orcs didn‚Äôt squeal, at least not in public. Mom had started for the door, and I raced down the hall to stop her. ‚ÄúMom! Don‚Äôt let them in yet. Wait until I‚Äôm downstairs and then when you open the door say something like *oh, another one. You must be here for the tryout*. Sell it. Make it sound like we‚Äôve been swamped all morning. Okay? Okay, mom?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever you say, Grik.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat. Remember. Sell it. And mom! Just be cool.‚Äù

With that, I ran back down to the basement and slid into place behind my card table. A second later, I heard the front door open and mom say ‚ÄúYou must be here for audition. Yes, many adventurers. More than you‚Äôd expect. In fact, we had to turn some away earlier. You are lucky. Very lucky. Well, come in. Can you wipe your feet for me? Thanks so much.‚Äù

She wasn‚Äôt selling it.

The basement door opened, and heavy footsteps started down the stairs. I held my breath as I waited to meet my first battle-scared hero of the day.

1jr1i3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1jr1i3n/quitting_the_second_time_was_way_harder_than_the/,Quitting the second time was way harder than the first.,"I quit nearly 5 years ago and I don‚Äôt remember it being that hard, it was just a tough week or two and then I started enjoying the benefits of reduced anxiety and even paced energy quite early on. 

Fast forward to quitting now, 4 weeks in (after being back on for 3 months) and it‚Äôs such a struggle. I feel so tired all the time and crappy mood most of the time.

The reason it‚Äôs been so hard only hit me today.

When I first quit I was in lockdown and couldn‚Äôt work from home. So I could rest, go for walks, do work around the house or garden, exercise and most importantly rest as much as I needed and not be chained to a desk. Now I‚Äôm back in an office staring at a screen all day and that‚Äôs been the biggest challenge for me. Weekends are easy, mornings, evenings, no problem. The 9-5? Brutal

We humans aren‚Äôt designed for this, no matter how meaningful it is or fun you find your job. Having to sit and focus on your screen and sit through meetings is not just hard, it feels like we‚Äôre going against human nature and coffee helps us to tolerate it. 

On the positive side my anxiety is down, I‚Äôm way more comfortable just chilling out, I read properly again (I literally couldn‚Äôt go for more than a few pages without being distracted), and I‚Äôm enjoying living a little slower, simpler and being more present. My resting heart rate rate is down 10%, I can fall asleep at high speed and I‚Äôm seeing more rem and deep sleep over shorter periods of sleep time and less mid-night wake ups.

TDLR is quitting would have been much easier for me if I was on holidays, between jobs or off work for any other reason. Also quitting has really emphasised just how painfully uncomfortable working in an office actually is. ",1,1743734540.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm 37, recently diagnosed with perimenopause after years of symptoms. I also have PCOS, a history of vitamin D deficiency, mild alpha thalassemia, and a high risk of osteoporosis. After seeing about 10 doctors and specialists, I finally landed with a menopause-focused doctor who connected the dots and suggested the following.

My morning routine looks like this:

Skincare:

Wash face
Niacinamide serum
Retinol anti-wrinkle moisturizer
Sunscreen
Oral care:

Brush
Floss
Waterpik
Alcohol-free mouthwash
Supplements/diet:

Collagen powder in coffee
Creatine in water
Protein/fiber smoothie between breakfast and lunch
Fish oil, multivitamin, Vitamin D + K, B12

Fitness:
I do resistance training, strength training, and light cardio regularly.

I eat as healthy as I can, but the supplements help make up for deficiencies and energy dips. I used to think this was all too much‚Äîuntil I started feeling better. Now I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs still over the top.

So‚Äîam I doing too much, or is this just what managing your health looks like at this age with my issues?

Intrepid Adventurers to join Oreloc‚Äôs newest adventuring guild! Are you a skilled warrior, mage, or rogue? Do you thirst for gold and glory? Then we want you! Tryouts this Saturday. NO BARDS.*

¬†

I nailed that add, and it only took two hours to write. It‚Äôs funny how the words just flow out of you when you know you‚Äôre doing something right. My parents thought this was a stupid idea. Why would anyone want to join my guild when they could drive into Castleton and sign up with one of the major guilds and make some serious questing money? They didn‚Äôt get it. Everyone knew that the big boys in the city started off small, just like I was doing. Give it a couple of years, I said, and I‚Äôll be set up in a nice cushy office, surrounded by treasure. Maybe I‚Äôd even get my name in the paper. I had big dreams, but first I needed a team.

I got my sister, Polk, to draw a picture of a half-orc (me, obviously), ripping the head off a goblin and spewing his guts all over the ground. I had to give her five gold pieces, and even then, needed to go back and add some extra blood‚Äîshe never does enough‚Äîbut when it was done, I had the perfect flyer. I used my dad‚Äôs Arcane Personal Scriptor to print off thirty copies and hung them all over town. Oreloc‚Äôs a suburb of Castleton and there are plenty of people around‚Äîorcs, fairies, gnomes, even a few dwarves‚Äîso I knew I‚Äôd get a good turnout. The elves live up in the Heights, where the mansions are, and I didn‚Äôt expect any of them to show up, but I didn‚Äôt need them anyway. An elf on the team would only make things more annoying.

Saturday morning came, and I was a wreck. I‚Äôd claimed the basement rumpus room as my tryout space and pushed all the furniture against the wall. The carpet was nailed down so there wasn‚Äôt much I could do about that, but I‚Äôd be sure no one got any blood anywhere. By nine o‚Äôclock, I was ready. Since the tryout didn‚Äôt start for another hour, my mom called me upstairs and forced me to have breakfast. I told her was too excited to eat but you know moms.

‚ÄúHave some eggs and toast, Grik. All of your little friends will have eaten breakfast. You don‚Äôt want to be starving when everyone else is full, do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not my friends, mom. They‚Äôre going to be my employees. I‚Äôm starting a business, here.‚Äù

‚ÄúEmployees, sorry. Do you want six eggs or seven?‚Äù

‚ÄúSeven please.‚Äù

She cracked them into the skillet and threw a loaf of bread in the toaster. My mom was human, but she understood the orc diet better than most people I knew. Even though I‚Äôd never seen her eat more than three plates of food at a time, she always made sure we, my dad, sister and I, had fifth helpings of everything. She was good that way.

My dad came in, dressed for yard work. During the week, he was an accountant in Castleton. He worked in the gold reserve at the palace. I didn‚Äôt know exactly what he did, something with conversion rates, but it required him to wear a tie and keep his tusks shiny. Today, he was dressed down in shorts and boat shoes. We had a nice house with the manicured lawn and two cars in the garage, and my mom always said how lucky we were that my dad had such a good job. That might have been true, but it was also so boring. Whenever he talked about his job, I would start to fall asleep.

I wanted adventure, danger, glory! I‚Äôd been asking for a battle ax for as long as I could remember, but my parents said that I had to wait until I was eighteen. That was two years away, a lifetime for an adventurer like me. In the meantime, I had turned an old baseball bat into a club. I‚Äôd even carved some runic symbols into it to make it more powerful. I didn‚Äôt know if they did anything, but I‚Äôd hit plenty of stuff and the bat was still in one piece, so something was working.

Mom slid a trey of eggs and half a loaf of bread in front of me and I gobbled them down as fast as I could. My sister rolled her eyes at me, but I didn‚Äôt care. Today was the start of *Adventurers, Inc.* The first step to being a real hero.

I finished, belched, and threw my plate into the sink.

‚ÄúCan I go get ready now?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes dear,‚Äù mom said. ‚ÄúYou can go play with your friends, now.‚Äù

‚ÄúMom! I told you they‚Äôre employees, not friends.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think you‚Äôre getting a little in over your head,‚Äù my dad said. He was reading the morning paper and sipping coffee. Mom slid a trey in front of him‚Äîfifteen eggs and two loaves of bread‚Äîand he set the paper down before shoveling the food into his mouth. When he finished, he burped loud enough to rattle the silver wear and patted his stomach. ‚ÄúGreat breakfast, Barb, thank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome my love. And I have to agree with your dad, Grik. Starting a business is a big deal, especially at your age. Don‚Äôt you want to be out riding your bike or playing baseball or doing something normal?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got your whole life to work, pal,‚Äù dad said. ‚ÄúIt sneaks up on you faster than you think. Trust me, I know.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd adventuring is such a hard life. Inconsistent, no insurance. And forget about retirement. I know you don‚Äôt want to be an accountant like your father but‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll never sit behind a desk,‚Äù I said, picking up my bat, which I had named Balinda after a gladiator I‚Äôd seen on the crystal ball one night after my parents had gone to sleep. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an adventurer. Its who I am. Dad crunches numbers. I crunch skulls.‚Äù

Polk exploded in giggles at that, spraying egg all over the table and then started choaking, which was exactly what she deserved. It was also my cue to leave.

‚ÄúPeople should start showing up any minute. Can you tell them to start a line in the hallway and I‚Äôll see them one at a time in the basement.

‚ÄúBut sweetheart‚Ä¶‚Äù mom said as she slammed her tiny human hand into Polk‚Äôs back. ‚ÄúI really think...‚Äù

‚ÄúMom, just be cool, alright. It‚Äôs going to work out.‚Äù I disappeared into the basement, my imagination filled with images of who I was going to see. A grizzled warlock who‚Äôd made an evil pact for unlimited power? A monk, silent but deadly, who could level the house with one empty hand? Maybe a paladin clad in silver armor, his holy sword slung over his back and the crest of his god seared onto his breastplate. Or a rogue, although no real rogue would use the front door. They‚Äôd just show up in the basement with me, hopefully with a knife to my throat. The possibilities were endless, and I stifled a squeal of excitement as I sat behind my examiner‚Äôs card table, note pad ready and Balinda leaning comfortingly against my leg.

Did I forget the address? No, I quadruple checked to make sure all the details were right before I ran the copies off on Dad‚Äôs APS-940. I knew I‚Äôd put up enough flyers. Mainstreet was plastered with them. I‚Äôd even put a few south of the tracks, thinking maybe I‚Äôd get a dwarf or two looking for extra work. But nothing. Something wasn‚Äôt right.

‚ÄúMom!‚Äù I shouted. Balinda was in my hand, and I tapped her against the countertop as I waited. Mom was upstairs folding laundry. Outside, dad was on his knees weeding the garden. His massive arms were almost ripping the sleeves of his blue polo shirt. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd ever have arms like that. I was only a half-orc, and the half of me that was human was still a little scrawny. I needed to eat more eggs or something, but I could worry about that later.

With that, I ran back down to the basement and slid into place behind my card table. A second later, I heard the front door open and mom say ‚ÄúYou must be here for audition. Yes, many adventurers. More than you‚Äôd expect. In fact, we had to turn some away earlier. You are lucky. Very lucky. Well, come in. Can you wipe your feet for me? Thanks so much.‚Äù

She wasn‚Äôt selling it.

The basement door opened, and heavy footsteps started down the stairs. I held my breath as I waited to meet my first battle-scared hero of the day.

Liver  / Adrenal / Colon / Circulatory,"I'm beyond frustrated.  I've been feeling like I'm having less energy, forgetting things I shouldn't and it's actually becoming noticeable and effecting relationships, and I get excited when I actually have a normal poop.  I'm a 40 yo female 180#s.  Most likely perimenopause.  Most of my life I've been in fight or flight.  From 21 to 38 I was a binge drinker. Turns out I wad coping for undiagnosed adhd, social anxiety and ptsd.  Live in drinking state where it's deeply ingrained in the culture. It's sad but I thought it was normal. I quit drinking about three years ago because I'd have one drink and get facial flushing and turn hot.  Have chest pains. Now that happens to me when I get stressed, have Starburst or candy, eat after long fast, or use my heated leather seats.  Feel like my body is not regulating temp.  I feel like when I eat my liver is struggling, my digestion is slow, I used to get constipated, now I just feel pressure like things are sitting in my colon fermenting.  But, seriously just started to get pressure near my anus these last few weeks and I'm freaking out. It's almost like I don't have the digestive enzymes to break it down. I struggle to eat consistently and when I do eat I feel rushed.  Eat the diet of a beef farmer and Midwestern US.  Recently started shifting to almost all whole foods.  These are my symptoms... I am beyond frustrated at this point.

Your Symptoms (Updated):

20s. Diagnosed with hyperhydrosis and easily bruising.  Played soccer in college and at one time had over 20 bruises.  Trainer told me to see specialist.  Specialist and his fancy fucking bow tie laughed at me and said I was fine.  Binge drank through college. Learned I was sensitive to sulfur.  Makes me feel like I was drugged. Married, two live vaginal births.

30s.  Hands hurt terrible and we're swollen, on fire.  Rheumatologist said it was Reactive arthritis due to untreated strep.  Lasted about three years.  Always felt better after antibiotics.  Still binge drinking.  Took nsaids.  Sometimes while drinking. Stupid I know.  Also prescripted Adderall.

40s shouldn't feel like this....

Fatigue and exhaustion‚Äîrarely completing a full day without energy tanking at some point.

Pinching piercing pain on the left side of your belly button before bowel movements when your core is engaged.

Pressure near the anus and constipation with slow digestion.

Terrible memory‚Äîforgetting names of people and places you've known for years.

Trouble focusing, possibly related to the exhaustion and cognitive fog.

Fluid retention in your feet (compression socks help).

Heel pain (relieved by daily hot baths).

Night sweats, facial flushing, and insomnia (feeling ‚Äúwired but tired‚Äù).

Fish Odor Syndrome *not diagnosed but i stink something terrible when i have mt dew coffee dt coke or or other caffeineted drinks or am stressed.  Dont drink sodas anymore.  It's like my body just doesn't metabolize them well. 
 when(Trimethylaminuria) and digestive inefficiencies.

Thinning eyebrows and hair shedding.

Joint pain sometimes in hands.

Diagnosed Hashimoto's (autoimmune thyroid disease).

Noticeable inflammation.

And I've noticed when I feel like i actually get energy back is after a round of antibiotics for an illness.

What bothers me most is the memory, pain in my anus and inconsistent poops, heel pain, exhaustion, feeling wired but tired when stressed (and will absolutely not sleep <3 hours when im in this state), and the facial flushing randomly.  No it's not hormones. 

I feel like I'm getting zero answers and taken so many tests.  If you know anything about these things, had similar experience, please help me and give me guidance.  I have kids I want to see grow up and be old.  I don't wantbit to be one of these things where it gets overlooked and maybe I'm just not advocating enough or loud enough.",1,1743733909.0,TheLiverDoc,0,1.0,False

1jr18ix,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalroad/comments/1jr18ix/is_my_random_idea_working/,Is my random idea working?,"I started a new story that's completely off the wall and not something I normally write. It's fun as hell but not what I usually see on Royal Road so I'm wondering if it works for the site or not.

Quick summary - Grik is a half-orc teenager who starts a guild out of his parent's suburban basement. He and his rag tag band of misfits start off with small quests around town, just to get their name out there, before they eventually move on to glory and riches.

*Wanted! Intrepid Adventurers to join Oreloc‚Äôs newest adventuring guild! Are you a skilled warrior, mage, or rogue? Do you thirst for gold and glory? Then we want you! Tryouts this Saturday. NO BARDS.*

¬†

I nailed that add, and it only took two hours to write. It‚Äôs funny how the words just flow out of you when you know you‚Äôre doing something right. My parents thought this was a stupid idea. Why would anyone want to join my guild when they could drive into Castleton and sign up with one of the major guilds and make some serious questing money? They didn‚Äôt get it. Everyone knew that the big boys in the city started off small, just like I was doing. Give it a couple of years, I said, and I‚Äôll be set up in a nice cushy office, surrounded by treasure. Maybe I‚Äôd even get my name in the paper. I had big dreams, but first I needed a team.

I got my sister, Polk, to draw a picture of a half-orc (me, obviously), ripping the head off a goblin and spewing his guts all over the ground. I had to give her five gold pieces, and even then, needed to go back and add some extra blood‚Äîshe never does enough‚Äîbut when it was done, I had the perfect flyer. I used my dad‚Äôs Arcane Personal Scriptor to print off thirty copies and hung them all over town. Oreloc‚Äôs a suburb of Castleton and there are plenty of people around‚Äîorcs, fairies, gnomes, even a few dwarves‚Äîso I knew I‚Äôd get a good turnout. The elves live up in the Heights, where the mansions are, and I didn‚Äôt expect any of them to show up, but I didn‚Äôt need them anyway. An elf on the team would only make things more annoying.

Saturday morning came, and I was a wreck. I‚Äôd claimed the basement rumpus room as my tryout space and pushed all the furniture against the wall. The carpet was nailed down so there wasn‚Äôt much I could do about that, but I‚Äôd be sure no one got any blood anywhere. By nine o‚Äôclock, I was ready. Since the tryout didn‚Äôt start for another hour, my mom called me upstairs and forced me to have breakfast. I told her was too excited to eat but you know moms.

‚ÄúHave some eggs and toast, Grik. All of your little friends will have eaten breakfast. You don‚Äôt want to be starving when everyone else is full, do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not my friends, mom. They‚Äôre going to be my employees. I‚Äôm starting a business, here.‚Äù

‚ÄúEmployees, sorry. Do you want six eggs or seven?‚Äù

‚ÄúSeven please.‚Äù

She cracked them into the skillet and threw a loaf of bread in the toaster. My mom was human, but she understood the orc diet better than most people I knew. Even though I‚Äôd never seen her eat more than three plates of food at a time, she always made sure we, my dad, sister and I, had fifth helpings of everything. She was good that way.

My dad came in, dressed for yard work. During the week, he was an accountant in Castleton. He worked in the gold reserve at the palace. I didn‚Äôt know exactly what he did, something with conversion rates, but it required him to wear a tie and keep his tusks shiny. Today, he was dressed down in shorts and boat shoes. We had a nice house with the manicured lawn and two cars in the garage, and my mom always said how lucky we were that my dad had such a good job. That might have been true, but it was also so boring. Whenever he talked about his job, I would start to fall asleep.

I wanted adventure, danger, glory! I‚Äôd been asking for a battle ax for as long as I could remember, but my parents said that I had to wait until I was eighteen. That was two years away, a lifetime for an adventurer like me. In the meantime, I had turned an old baseball bat into a club. I‚Äôd even carved some runic symbols into it to make it more powerful. I didn‚Äôt know if they did anything, but I‚Äôd hit plenty of stuff and the bat was still in one piece, so something was working.

Mom slid a trey of eggs and half a loaf of bread in front of me and I gobbled them down as fast as I could. My sister rolled her eyes at me, but I didn‚Äôt care. Today was the start of *Adventurers, Inc.* The first step to being a real hero.

I finished, belched, and threw my plate into the sink.

‚ÄúCan I go get ready now?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes dear,‚Äù mom said. ‚ÄúYou can go play with your friends, now.‚Äù

‚ÄúMom! I told you they‚Äôre employees, not friends.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think you‚Äôre getting a little in over your head,‚Äù my dad said. He was reading the morning paper and sipping coffee. Mom slid a trey in front of him‚Äîfifteen eggs and two loaves of bread‚Äîand he set the paper down before shoveling the food into his mouth. When he finished, he burped loud enough to rattle the silver wear and patted his stomach. ‚ÄúGreat breakfast, Barb, thank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome my love. And I have to agree with your dad, Grik. Starting a business is a big deal, especially at your age. Don‚Äôt you want to be out riding your bike or playing baseball or doing something normal?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got your whole life to work, pal,‚Äù dad said. ‚ÄúIt sneaks up on you faster than you think. Trust me, I know.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd adventuring is such a hard life. Inconsistent, no insurance. And forget about retirement. I know you don‚Äôt want to be an accountant like your father but‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll never sit behind a desk,‚Äù I said, picking up my bat, which I had named Balinda after a gladiator I‚Äôd seen on the crystal ball one night after my parents had gone to sleep. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an adventurer. Its who I am. Dad crunches numbers. I crunch skulls.‚Äù

Polk exploded in giggles at that, spraying egg all over the table and then started choaking, which was exactly what she deserved. It was also my cue to leave.

‚ÄúPeople should start showing up any minute. Can you tell them to start a line in the hallway and I‚Äôll see them one at a time in the basement.

‚ÄúBut sweetheart‚Ä¶‚Äù mom said as she slammed her tiny human hand into Polk‚Äôs back. ‚ÄúI really think...‚Äù

‚ÄúMom, just be cool, alright. It‚Äôs going to work out.‚Äù I disappeared into the basement, my imagination filled with images of who I was going to see. A grizzled warlock who‚Äôd made an evil pact for unlimited power? A monk, silent but deadly, who could level the house with one empty hand? Maybe a paladin clad in silver armor, his holy sword slung over his back and the crest of his god seared onto his breastplate. Or a rogue, although no real rogue would use the front door. They‚Äôd just show up in the basement with me, hopefully with a knife to my throat. The possibilities were endless, and I stifled a squeal of excitement as I sat behind my examiner‚Äôs card table, note pad ready and Balinda leaning comfortingly against my leg.

\*\*\*

Two hours later, I stomped back upstairs, some of my excitement trickling away. No one had shown up, yet. I didn‚Äôt understand it. I put the date and time on the flyer, I know I did. Did I forget the address? No, I quadruple checked to make sure all the details were right before I ran the copies off on Dad‚Äôs APS-940. I knew I‚Äôd put up enough flyers. Mainstreet was plastered with them. I‚Äôd even put a few south of the tracks, thinking maybe I‚Äôd get a dwarf or two looking for extra work. But nothing. Something wasn‚Äôt right.

‚ÄúMom!‚Äù I shouted. Balinda was in my hand, and I tapped her against the countertop as I waited. Mom was upstairs folding laundry. Outside, dad was on his knees weeding the garden. His massive arms were almost ripping the sleeves of his blue polo shirt. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd ever have arms like that. I was only a half-orc, and the half of me that was human was still a little scrawny. I needed to eat more eggs or something, but I could worry about that later. I had more pressing things on my mind.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong sweetheart?‚Äù Mom said, coming into the kitchen.

‚ÄúHas anyone shown up?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one has come by looking for my guild tryouts? Maybe someone you didn‚Äôt recognize and turned away? Anyone?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs come, hon. And I know what all of your friends look like. I‚Äôd never ask them to leave.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not my‚Ä¶never mind. Somethings going on. Why isn‚Äôt anyone here?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre a level 1 loser, that‚Äôs why!‚Äù My sister was at the top of the stairs, with her hands on her hips. She had leg warmers on and a green scrunchy wrapped into her hair. ‚ÄúNoone wants to be in your stupid loser‚Äôs guild.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up, pig face.‚Äù

‚ÄúTroll.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough you two.‚Äù Mom was a good two feet shorter than me and Polk, but she could shut us up when she needed to. Polk skipped down the stairs, suddenly the perfect daughter.

‚ÄúMommy, I‚Äôm going to the mall with Nayak and a few of the girls. Is that alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course it is. Have fun. Say high to everyone for me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will. Love you.‚Äù She stuck her tongue out at me as she skipped to the door, mouthing *bye looser* before slamming it behind her.

There was no way Polk was right. My flyer was gold. If I had seen it on the street, I‚Äôd have picked up Balinda and run straight over. Something was keeping all of the adventurers away, I just didn‚Äôt know what. Was every hero in Oreloc already guilded up? No, that didn‚Äôt make sense. There were plenty of independent contractors out there. Maybe there weren‚Äôt enough guts coming out of the dismembered goblin‚Ä¶

There was a knock at the door, and I jumped, wheeling Balinda around.

‚ÄúWill you put that thing away before you break something?‚Äù Mom said. Outside, dad peeked his head around the corner and raised his massive eyebrows. That was a good sign. Dad was an accountant so there wasn‚Äôt much that interested him.

‚ÄúAn adventurer,‚Äù I said. I had to suppress another squeal of excitement. Orcs didn‚Äôt squeal, at least not in public. Mom had started for the door, and I raced down the hall to stop her. ‚ÄúMom! Don‚Äôt let them in yet. Wait until I‚Äôm downstairs and then when you open the door say something like *oh, another one. You must be here for the tryout*. Sell it. Make it sound like we‚Äôve been swamped all morning. Okay? Okay, mom?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever you say, Grik.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat. Remember. Sell it. And mom! Just be cool.‚Äù

With that, I ran back down to the basement and slid into place behind my card table. A second later, I heard the front door open and mom say ‚ÄúYou must be here for audition. Yes, many adventurers. More than you‚Äôd expect. In fact, we had to turn some away earlier. You are lucky. Very lucky. Well, come in. Can you wipe your feet for me? Thanks so much.‚Äù

# What Is ""Linking Your Thinking - Nick Milo"" All About?

Alright, let‚Äôs break it down‚Äî**""Linking Your Thinking - Nick Milo""** is not your average online course. It‚Äôs a **6-week deep-dive live workshop** designed to help you build a Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system that actually works *for you*.

Whether you're using Obsidian, Notion, or even plain text files, **""Linking Your Thinking - Nick Milo""** is all about helping *you* craft a PKM system that fits like a glove.

# Why Does It Matter?

Because your brain is full of gold‚Äîyou just need a way to mine it efficiently.

In a world drowning in data, being able to *link your thinking* is honestly a superpower.

# When and How Does It Work?

The workshop runs over six weeks, and everything is **drip-fed**‚Äîmeaning you won‚Äôt be overwhelmed. Each week, you get a new unit with video lessons and practical exercises (about an hour per week), plus there are **12 live sessions** for real-time learning and interaction. Don‚Äôt worry if you can‚Äôt make a session‚Äîrecordings are provided!

And yep, it‚Äôs not just passive learning. There‚Äôs a **24/7 online community**, peer mentoring, and even fun extras like Rendezvous Week and Topic Clubs. It‚Äôs like a cozy brain gym for note nerds.

# Where Do You Access It?

Everything‚Äôs online, baby. Once you sign up, you get **lifetime access to the full LYT curriculum**. The community is hosted digitally too, so you can drop in from anywhere‚Äîyour couch, your office, or your favorite coffee shop. All you need is a decent internet connection and the curiosity to think deeper.

He doesn‚Äôt throw jargon at you‚Äîhe guides you gently through concepts like ""Maps of Content,"" ""Idea Emergence,"" and ""Atomic Notes"" until they feel second nature. He‚Äôs basically the friend who helps you clean up your mental garage *without* judging your mess.

# Final Thoughts ‚Äì Is It Worth It?

Absolutely. If you're tired of forgetting great ideas, losing track of inspirations, or drowning in digital clutter, **""Linking Your Thinking - Nick Milo""** is a game-changer. It's not just a course‚Äîit‚Äôs a mind-expanding experience that helps you think better, write better, and create better. You‚Äôre not just managing information; you‚Äôre unlocking insight.

This is a long story but I want to make it short.

I met this guy last year in April in the library and we opened up a lot, very fast. He eventually introduced me to a lot of his friends and family and we talked more (started going to his church). He's one of those very argumentative guys who has strong beliefs and rarely negotiates (loves to debate types and laugh at you for not agreeing with him). I didn't see this side of him until things settled down.

I gave him a lot of advice regarding girls and career stuff etc. I came to him for advice like once regarding a job interview I had even though he doesn't have experience with interviews (he works at a movie theatre and I work in a high rise office. im not putting him down when I say this for your information but he hints at wishing he could do my type of job). The other day, the topic of politics came up and he mentioned how he is a republican and asked what I support and I said democrat. He said he guessed its probably because my father was a democrat and I said yes, partially but not entirely because of my father. He laughed and said how much (in terms of influence) ? I said I wouldn't quantify it and then he said ok ""I'm gonna assume a lot"" and started to tell me about how everything ive agreed with is basically what republicans support. it sounded like he was trying to convince me, subtly - even started telling me to go read more on DJT and what he stands for and to not listen to media's that destroy his reputation.

The next day, over text, I addressed the part where he assumed im solely a democrat because of my father and said ""Hey Charles, I didn‚Äôt appreciate how you tried boxing me in yesterday when you said you believe the reason I‚Äôm liberal is solely due to my father after I told you I didn‚Äôt want to go into politics. An apology will suffice"". This sparked conflict and asked me to meet him in person which I did. But he sent this before we met that evening when we went back and forth :

""Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I‚Äôm looking forward to taking about what you didn‚Äôt like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I‚Äôll hit u up for next time. I‚Äôm looking forward to it.""

I ended up going to meet. I bought us both coffee at Starbucks and sat on a couch with him. In person, he insulted my character, raised his voice and said I only asked him to apologize because I have low self esteem and low confidence and how I want to bring him down to my level by forcing an apology and submit, how he doesn't trust me, how I love to argue, how controlling I am etc. I told him he's wrong about me and im not doing that and even mentioned the things ive done for him that were in his best interest like uplift him (not to come off as bragging but to dismantle his argument and show him my perspective).

After he left. I sent him this :

I don‚Äôt feel bad about myself Charles nor do I have low self esteem. I'm ok the way I am, Charles even much better than others

This apology thing bothered you that much, to the point where you began insulting me and throwing all kinds of bad words in my direction.¬†

People do things in their life, sometimes bad sometimes good, even you joke about it when it happens.¬†

But you took it seriously today (even the texting) and threw unnecessary bad words against my character.¬†Non stop.

I‚Äôm not interested in ever being friends after this. I don‚Äôt deserve this type of treatment and disrespect. Ciao for now"".

Its been almost 9 weeks of no contact and i've stopped going to that specific church (I get texts from people at church saying they miss me and asking if everything is alright but I just say ive been busy with work and school stuff to avoid drama). When he sees me in passing he just nods my head or actually gives me a pound with his fist and says ""hey what's up Adam"". AITA ?",1,1743733094.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

1jr0zl8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SPNAnalysis/comments/1jr0zl8/nightmare_1_death_by_lack_of_headrests/,Nightmare (1): Death by lack of headrests.,"***Supernatural,*** **Season 1**  
**Episode 14, ‚ÄúNightmare‚Äù**  
**Written by Sera Gamble and Raelle Tucker**  
**Directed by Philip Sgriccia**

This is the first of many *Supernatural* episodes that were directed by the talented Phil Sgriccia. His cinematic style made for many visually memorable episodes, and this is no exception. It contains a number of dramatic, not to mention shocking, images - but we'll get to those . . . Paired with the writing team who already brought us ""Dead in the Water"" and ""Faith"", we can expect this to be another emotionally intense, character driven episode.  
  
It begins with the supernatural murder of one Jim Miller. Locked in his car and inside his garage by some unseen force, he's unable to escape when exhaust smoke starts pouring through the dashboard vents and he consequently dies of asphyxiation and CO2 poisoning.

https://preview.redd.it/k8hpwsrk0qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee4930c48418296d1168f66101da335ce45a8258

I've heard if you're ever in this position, and you have headrests on your seats, you can pull them off and use them to smash the windows. So I guess our victim of the week died of a lack of headrests.  
  
For those who watched the aired episode (or the DVD), and are very familiar with Bob Seger's songs, there may have been an early clue to the identity of the perpertrator in the track that was playing as Jim drove up to the house and into his garage; the first verse of Seger's ""2+2=?"" begins ""yes, it's true I am a young man/but I'm old enough to kill.""

After a clutter of random images from the garage, including a number plate, the scene shifts to Sam in bed and we realize it's another one of his psychic dreams. As he sits up we see that he's sweating.

https://preview.redd.it/8n07zi7z0qse1.jpg?width=515&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=002c220291336cc247d1c3747fe77cf6993884e9

The nightmares are beginning to take a physical toll on him. That's going to become an important point later.  
  
I love how the scene ends, with Sam hustling Dean to get moving, and we get this lovely transition from a lamp on the desk to the Impala's headlamps as the brothers hit the road:

https://preview.redd.it/tyfzmwy41qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee91ed10e4a250c5f67b04cd90a40c9762c82dbc

https://preview.redd.it/1dq3wwy41qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65806d76dd1598d8005cccf700858244c868f557

It does a great job of moving the action along smoothly and helps to create the sense of dramatic urgency.

Sam and Dean arrive at Jim Miller's house to find him already dead, purportedly from suicide. Both brothers are clearly disturbed by Sam's prophetic dreams.

https://preview.redd.it/wwhpxtzq1qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2036a4866c02128669e35d940c47fe420f4518bc

https://preview.redd.it/1c45ox9u1qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f696cccf606550d844d48d661a45eb586607a2d6

""I'm not looking at you like anything,"" Dean insists. ""Though, I gotta say, you look like crap.""

The episode script emphasizes that Sam looks pale and sweaty in this scene, still suffering from the effects of his vision. ([http://www.supernaturalwiki.com/1.14\_Nightmare#Sides.2C\_Scripts\_.26\_Transcripts](http://www.supernaturalwiki.com/1.14_Nightmare#Sides.2C_Scripts_.26_Transcripts)) It doesn't really come across on screen however - Sam looks physically fine here - which is unfortunate because a visual emphasis on Sam's vision-ravaged appearance would have helped to make Dean's comment make sense. More importantly, the scriptwriters clearly hoped to indicate a subtle optical clue and parallel to Max as we see him later.

This episode is infamous for another memorable scene:

https://preview.redd.it/brv2fs713qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=886ed36b932f37b64b4176d196174b4c945f33d7

For some reason, fans seem to get very excited whenever the brothers appear in priest attire. Mind you, when they think of this scene, I think many remember the season one gag reel more vividly:  


https://preview.redd.it/sxzidr713qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2126e73b5ef7a90f2e06f3ea606495294ad5683

It seems the *Supernatural* fandom acquired a reputation for being a somewhat kinky bunch. I have no idea where that came from . . .

https://preview.redd.it/53ddo76q3qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34442a7c5f4cd383a6140c4e80c2a4ee698ca857



https://preview.redd.it/9ky94q7w4qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7cd2afcedce3e0d1e75198df06e994f287dc00bc

If any of you assumed Dean was staring inappropriately at Mrs Miller's chest in this frame, that might be a reasonable guess, but you'd be wrong: he's actually eyeing the casserole dish she's holding.

https://preview.redd.it/2hw94r7w4qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c14e2fdf7dacdcef4f69ccb0f13d97793518f226

Popular fanon has it that the reason Dean stuffs his face at every available opportunity is because he frequently went hungry to feed Sam in their childhood but, in fact, the show writers never intended any such dark backstory. The truth is, the running gag began when Jensen did a comic bit as an adlib just because he thought it was funny. The show runners agreed, so they ran with it. It's just a lighthearted gag folks, and I think it's pretty funny. üòÜ

https://preview.redd.it/i97l4ay08qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fd77365ec2e1690bd2b95f4ee5a111cee1521aa

Here we see Sam carefully balancing a cup of coffee to avoid spilling its contents. When he's first given the cup, he quickly snatches one hand away and flicks his fingers, indicating that the coffee was hot enough to singe his fingertips. I love that Jared always conscientiously adds these little details to try to convince us there's actually something in those cups! üòÜ



https://preview.redd.it/795874m46qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf75215aa2374a80ed52cc8af921d40828226e61

In Sam's first interview with Max Miller, we see the boy looks pale and his skin has a sweaty sheen to it. At this stage, it's easily attributable to the trauma of losing his father, especially because he reveals he found the body. Later, however, we'll realize that using his powers takes a physical toll on him, just as Sam's visions do on him.  
  
Another detail that's dropped in this conversation is that Max is living at home because he's struggling to save for college. Presumably he lacked the intellectual ability to score a full ride, but his desire to go to college at least is something with which Sam can identify.

https://preview.redd.it/x08rd72l6qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b3c0ad2a59fee874c64de37233451e8d06b59b5

Meanwhile, Dean is checking the house for cold spots. I believe this was the one and only time we saw the infrared thermal scanner. I liked it because it's another authentic tool used by real life paranormal investigators to detect cold spots etc. But perhaps the show runners thought it was too high-tech for our blue-collar brothers. It's certainly a big step up from the homemade EMF meter Dean jigged up from an old Walkman earlier in the season!

After a few months he unblocked me on Instagram and started sending reels to each other, I asked to go for coffee or a drink with him but he would always say maybe further on or would say let me think about it but always come back with a negative reply.

1jr0wpr,https://www.shine.cn/opinion/2504032689/,"Harnessing people's inertia and nudging your way to tame outdoor smoking; ""Education Matters"" said the Security Guard.","If we hate passive smoking, we probably will prefer an outright ban to simple moralization, forgetting that something in the middle may well work wonders in certain contexts.

Since mid-March, Shanghai has proceeded to curb outdoor second-hand smoke in eight popular destinations, including the Bund, the Wukang Road area and the suburban Panlong Tiandi, with a policy mix of persuasion and publicity that amounts to a proper nudge.

A nudge is neither a total ban nor a mere theoretical teaching. It's sort of a middle way ‚Äì active persuasion without pushing too hard, a strategy that requires both the property management of a certain place to create a relatively smoke-free atmosphere and its security guards or volunteers to respectfully dissuade outdoor smokers rather than simply slapping them with fines.

While many netizens applaud Shanghai's latest action as timely and necessary, quite a few also wonder whether a nudge will be enough to deter those who habitually smoke while walking. After all, Shanghai has already banned smoking in all indoor spaces and certain outdoor places like those in kindergartens, primary and middle schools, children's hospitals and the auditoriums and competition areas of stadiums.

""Why not ban all outdoor smoking?"" one netizen commented in a recent post. ""If you don't fine them hard, outdoor smokers won't budge.""

At first I sort of shared this view, believing that nothing short of an outright ban would have teeth in our collective efforts to tame outdoor smoking, but onsite interviews I conducted at Panlong Tiandi, in Qingpu District, on Tuesday have changed my mind.

Diligent Guards

Long accustomed to running into people smoking on sidewalks or in parks, I was surprised to find Panlong Tiandi, a 50-hectare watertown, which comprises commercial outlets, residential complexes and green spaces, to be particularly quiet and clean.

During my half-day interviews and observation, I simply saw no cigarette butt on the ground.

Certainly what I saw could not be the whole picture, so I interviewed a number of on-duty Security Guards, who were patrolling the inner circle of the watertown, where a large number of visitors were relaxing at riverside cafes, bakeries, restaurants, or pavilions.

I also saw many elderly people playing with their grandchildren or chatting over coffee, and a number of young people reading or rambling ‚Äì all enjoying their quiet moments at riverfront spaces without being exposed to second-hand smoke from other visitors.

This was in sharp contrast to what I experienced in a pocket park near my suburban home in the past couple of years, where even some Security Guards often smoked wantonly in disregard of singular posters pointing to a designated outdoor smoking area.

On closer observation, I found many shops had placed a card on each outdoor dining table, carrying four Chinese characters ‚Äì qing wu xi yan (ËØ∑ÂãøÂê∏ÁÉü) ‚Äì which means ""Please do not smoke.""

""You don't see many 'no smoking' signs on the streets, but many commercial outlets, especially those in the inner circle of the watertown, have joined our efforts to nudge tourists toward cultivating a habit of not smoking in crowded outdoor spaces,"" a middle-aged Security Guard, who stood by a public ashtray placed away from crowds, told me.

""And if we find someone smoking while walking through a crowd, we confront him or her politely,"" he added. ""In most cases smokers cooperate by leaving the crowd and coming over to the ashtray area to smoke.""

""If you can fine them, do you think a fine works better than polite persuasion plus a proper arrangement of ashtrays across the town?"" I asked, still unsure whether a nudge ""had teeth.""

""Well, a fine certainly works in a given context, but it could also stir up an unwanted quarrel, especially if some smokers don't realize that puffing in outdoor public spaces can cause severe harm to others' health. Education matters, and most smokers heed our advice.""

""If my experience is anything to go by, then at least 88 out of 100 smokers will accept my persuasion and quit smoking in crowded outdoor spaces,"" another Security Guard told me. ""Most visitors here don't smoke, and among a few who do, most are willing to stop smoking while walking in a crowd, or smoke only in a less crowded corner where there's an ashtray.""

This young Security Guard was on duty near an ancient stone bridge surrounded by a plethora of shops and pavilions, where many people came and went.

""There is a Security Guard near every bridge, seeing to it that no one smokes wantonly,"" he informed. ""In case someone turns a deaf ear to our persuasion, we notify nearby janitors to clean each cigarette butt possibly scattered along the way.""",1,1743732675.0,Secguards,0,1.0,False

I did it sort of slowly this time. 0 junk food for more than a month now, less than 20 carbs a day for around 3 weeks, and now 14 days of carnivore. I feel... really good for the most part, compared to what I did before.

OK, I get it that the carnivore 'purists' are going to flame me to cinders for this. But I drink one cup of coffee each morning with either grass fed butter, or ghee, and heavy whipping cream. Gives me a great energy shot for morning (I'm not a morning person, but have to get up about 8am to work). Besides the coffee in the morning, nothing but meat and eggs for 14 days now. I have more energy, and extremely increased motivation. I'm planning on sticking it out. I only eat in an 8 hour period each day, typically 2 meals a day. I don't think I'm eating enough calories yet, but I'm never really hungry like I used to be. I don't get cravings, but when I do eat, I enjoy it. But I can easily go an entire day and not even get hungry at all.

Also, my blood pressure has dropped quite a bit. I've been on 2 meds for BP and the pharmacy dropped the ball and I ran out of one of them for 5 days, so have only been taking one and my BP still dropped 10-15pts. My dr. said it's the diet doing it, he's pro carnivore, so that's good that I have that for support anyway. My wife is even trying it now after seeing the changes in me so fast, I dropped 8 lbs already, about 15-20 to go.

Started my first dose March 16th and first week had the normal side effects. Biggest being constipated and just damn tired all the time. When I started Wegovy in March I gave up coffee too. Could this be why I am so tired all the time ? I've noticed before Wegovy  some of my hikes I could do 6 miles easily and now I struggle to get them done. For the constipation I started taking magO7 but the pharmacist told me that I shouldn't take it daily. Is it safe?? I started the one capsule daily and that's been working great!!

1jr0o39,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jr0o39/am_i_37m_mentally_abusing_my_39f_or_is_this/,"Am I [37M] mentally abusing my [39F], or is this gaslighting?","I react very badly to this, because I really don't want to mentally abuse anyone. The moment she told me, I went straight into myself to figure out what went wrong and how I could improve. English is not my main language, so I wasn't sure what mentally abuse really means. She said the reason she feels I am mentally abusing her, is because she cannot say anything without being met with negativity on the topic.

We have had some hard weeks lately. I have been sick a lot, and some deaths in my family as well as some problems in my house I had to fix. Hard time in general, funds are going down, so in general our mood havent been the best. I have been trying to figure out how I am mentally abusing her, but after reading a lot about it and being open minded, I have came to conclusion that ""mentally abuse"" is not the right word here. Instead, I am ""Irritable, Neglectful and Passive-aggressive"". Another word that fit my behavior is ""belittling"".

I have lived alone all my life, and I am a massive introvert. I don't get any energy from social gathering. She knows this, and we have been talking a lot about this. I struggle for example in the mornings, before breakfast and coffee, she tend to have massive house projects or topics going on, and its too much for me those minutes. Here is usually where I have had my negative mood towards her. Sometimes I tell her that I need half an hour to calm down if the day have been long, like eating dinner and rest with just watching a 30 min episode of something to shut my brain off. Constantly there is something she needs or wants, and I try to be patient but sometimes I am not and I make a face or some ""sigh"" because of it.

However, she does this too. Which is why I am so confused right now by being called mentally abusive. Because one time I was in good mood, and was walking around the livingroom doing some measurement for some furnitures, and she completely snapped at me for doing that when she didnt want to do any work. I told her she doesnt have to do anything, I just have some motivation now and doing some measurements, but I ended up getting so much shit for it. She even at one point said I forced her to start this work during her relax time, which I absolutely didn't do. 

Anyway, after reading a lot about mentally abuse while being very open minded about I have to do some changes, I noticed a few things. A lot of the definitions of mentally abuse, is stuff I feel she does to me. Gaslighting for example. Or this silent punishment, Dismissing Feelings, Passive-Aggressive Behavior and a lot of other stuff.

I told her I read the definition about mental abuse, and read it to her. After reading it, she clearly felt targetted, even though I didnt target her at all, I just said I don't feel calling me mentally abusive is the right word here, while reading the definition. After reading she asked me ""do you think I do this""? She said it in a bit tricky question way, like I heard she was clearly offended by the definition (which I didnt make up). I tried to not put fuel on the fire and said ""since you ask, there is one thing I read that I might recognize you have done a few times in the past, which is being silent instead of talking about things, or if stuff doesnt go your way you say ""fine you are on your own"" and then leaves (this can be some small stuff like color on a wall or something).

Well, she got very angry and offended, and said ""This is absolutely 0% true"". I am now starting to realize that this might be the gaslighting? I dont' really know that word, but I read about it.

Our relationship have lasted for many years, and as an introvert living away from other people, I dont have many in my life. We play games online when we arent together, and in general it works fine. But I also want to have self respect and do the right thing. If I am mentally abusing her, I really need to work on myself. But the reason I write this, is because it felt so bad confronting her about what I read and she just straight out refuses the facst. In fact, she blames me now, saying I only say it to push the responsible over on her. I keep saying thats not the case, and I will be working on myself a lot here, but she just refuse to take it.

This is one situation out of many, and there is always two sides of a case. I feel recently I dont stand up for myself as much as I should, because I am scared of losing her. I am a very objective person here, but I also have feelings. And the feelings right now, is that I don't know how much I should stand on what I believe is right, because if I keep telling her that I am not the one thats mentally abusing, but she is, the relationship might end. There is no way in hell she will work on that. So now I have to sit and work on my mentally abusing behavior, while deep inside I feel I am the one being mentally abused. What is your impression? I tried being as honest as I could.

Tldr: My girlfriend say I mentally abuse her because I am sometimes negative when I respond to her topics. After reading about the meaning of ""mentally abuse"", I realised she might be the one that does it to me, and it feels bad I have to work for not being mentally abusive if she is the one that should work on it.",0,1743731961.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

AYFKM?!

My rationale for asking. I have a history of IDA. My worsening symptoms are fatigue, muscles feel weak, brain fog, dark under eye circles despite plenty of sleep, and restless leg. I feel miserable at lot of the time. 

I've also been taking only 65mg every 2 days with coffee and got my period back after pregnancy about 4 months ago (with heavy bleeding). I also had a 2L hemorrhage after giving birth a year ago. After reading about iron deficiency for 5 minutes, I've learned I'm supplementing wrong, as well as the facts that my iron has possibly never been optimized and it can take months to recover feeritin after losing blood like that.

Additional symptoms: I get headaches frequently (not migraines, but noise/light sensitive at times), yawn constantly, have bendable/brittle nails, baseline fatigue and dark under eye circles,  am always the person who is cold, and can see veins through my hands and arms when i get really cold. I just thought these were ""me"" things. 

I've had normal autoimmune, Lyme, cmp, b12, ebv, and some other tests recently. CBC has had consistent mildly low WBCs/neutrophils since October. I have that done monthly.

Ever find yourself staring at your to-do list, wondering if there's some kind of magic trick to actually getting everything done *without* sacrificing your sanity? üòÖ I‚Äôve been there, trust me. So, I decided to take on a challenge: **Time Blocking vs. Habit Stacking**. Which one would help me reclaim my time... and maybe even my life back? üöÄ

I went into this experiment with a healthy dose of skepticism and a hefty cup of coffee. Here‚Äôs how it all went down:

### Week 1: Time Blocking üïí

Picture this: Calendar open, colorful blocks everywhere, feeling like I'm about to launch a space shuttle with this mission control setup. üòÜ

- **First Impressions**: Felt like a productivity superhero! ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Everything had a time slot, and I was SUPER organized. But, like Thor‚Äôs hammer, not everyone can wield this power.

- **Reality Check**: Life happens! Meetings run over, family emergencies pop up, and suddenly those neat blocks started looking like a Jenga tower mid-collapse. üò¨

- **Highlight Moment**: Definitely kept me focused during those golden hours. Plus, the satisfaction of ticking off a perfectly blocked day‚Äî*chef's kiss*! üëå

### Week 2: Habit Stacking üîó

Switching gears, I embraced habit stacking with the enthusiasm of a kid at a candy store. üç¨ I mean, who wouldn't want to effortlessly build habits like adding extra cookies to your third dessert?

- **First Impressions**: Easier to slip into my life, kinda like putting on your favorite hoodie. Cozy and seamless.

- **Surprising Twist**: Turns out, habits are the unsung heroes when life goes off-script. Didn‚Äôt matter if I was running late or feeling under the weather; these micro-routines just happened. üôå

- **Highlight Moment**: Realizing that pairing small tasks together‚Äîlike brewing coffee while listening to a podcast‚Äîadded up to a whole lot of extra time AND newfound skills. üéß‚òï

#### **The Verdict?** ü§î

Here's the kicker: Combining both Time Blocking for the big stuff *and* Habit Stacking for the small, repetitive tasks saved me over **10 hours a week**. Who would've thought the answer was a little bit of both, right?

So, there it is, my fellow life-maximizers. This journey taught me that sometimes it‚Äôs not about picking one side; it‚Äôs about finding a personal rhythm that feels like you‚Äôre finally *dancing* through your days instead of stumbling. üíÉüï∫

How about you all? Got any quirky tricks that have saved you time, or maybe stories about trying to tame the chaos? I‚Äôd love to hear them! üòä",1,1743731118.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Looking to rent 1 room in a modern 3 bedroom 3 bathroom apartment located in Ocean Hill, Brooklyn. Rooms can fit a queen sized bed and a computer desk with it's own closet.

Seeking clean and tidy roommate. preferably folks in their late 20s-30s. The current roommate and I are relatively quiet.

Laundry in basement.  
Rooftop access available (nothing fancy, but nice view of Manhattan)

I matched with this guy who was cute, like in a bear sort of way (I don't know how to describe this type). He had a pretty cool beard and mustache, and graduated from a reputable school so I told myself, baka okay naman. 

Boyyyyyy I was wrong. He was funny at first sa chat, but IRL he was really awkward, which would've been okay. But tapon-tapon yung bits ng food niya sa beard niya when we were eating. I let it pass kasi he cleaned up after eating sa CR, so sabi ko baka hindi lang napansin. Before leaving the resto, he said, ""The food was really oishi, ano?"" OISHI????

Then while we were walking, he patted my head and said, ""Pat, pat, pat, you're so cute irl bb."" Like??? Excuse me? You're 35yo man? He really said I-R-L. Gaano ba kahirap sabihin yung ""in real life"". 

I already had the ick, so I knew I just had to wait until the date was over. We had coffee and I sat it out nalang to be respectful. Second ick was when I found out he was living with his dad and was bummed because his stepmom moved in. He really said ""bummed"". I asked him what his mom thought about it and apparently 10 years nang wala yung mom niya but he's still uncomfortable about his dad dating. Sabi ko his dad might need companionship. Sabi niya, ""What for, we're besties naman."" BESTIES????

When I was leaving he tried to kiss me on the forehead??? He saw me pull back so he tried to hug me instead? So we had an awkward hug, like I tapped his back ganun. Okay naman perfume niya, naka-Replica Jazz Club. 

When I got home I thanked him for the date but I told him I don't think we're a match because I didn't think we're looking for the same things. 

His response is attached here.

But I've had it for a few years and wanted to share my success with coffees like Sey (light/ultra light and washed process). While of course it lacks the clarity of other grinders, it can still be delicious, super sweet,  with a nice texture. 

\--

My Sey espresso recipe: 

* Beans 3-6 weeks off roast
* Fine side of espresso range, 12-14 on Niche
* Puck prep: use the niche dosing cup as a blind shaker, then WDT
* Underdosed basket (16-17g in an 18g pullman basket) with a ultrathin puck screen to avoid headspace issues 
* Machine PID set to 201F
* Low pressure pre-infusion for 5-10 seconds 
* High ratio of 1:3 - 1:4 in 20-30 seconds total

  
Of course all these steps aren't necessary, but with the Niche it makes getting a good shot so consistent. In a world of increasing coffee prices, having a forgiving grinder/process is a real boon. ",1,1743730481.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

No matter what I try, I just can‚Äôt get good sleep. I fall asleep okay sometimes, but I wake up multiple times throughout the night and rarely feel rested in the morning. Here's what I‚Äôve already done:

Vitamin D levels: tested, well within normal range

Caffeine: I only take coffee before noon

Zinc: supplementing consistently

Exercise: I‚Äôve tried light, moderate, and heavy workouts ‚Äì no improvement

Melatonin: 3mg helps me fall asleep a bit faster, but the sleep quality is still trash

Cortisol: recently got blood work done, levels came back normal

Testosterone: came back at 148 ng/dL, though it was tested in the evening (I know that's not ideal)


Still, the sleep fragmentation continues no matter what. I‚Äôm not dealing with any major stressors or anxiety (at least consciously), and I try to keep a decent sleep routine.

I was nervous and had a friend take me and pick me up from the appointment. Before I took 600 mg Ibuprofen and a xanax. I took a stress ball to squeeze. 

The nurse and gyno talked me through every step. They did a licocaine block to the cervix and this injection did sting and was the worst part. Next was an injection of epinephrine to reduce bleeding and as they warned me, it made my heart rate increase and I felt tingly due to adrenaline but it didn't last long. I then waited in the room to be numb for 10-15 min looking at my phone calmly. The doctor ame back in and turned on the electrocautery machine and told me about the sound. I didn't feel any of the biopsies. It was quickly over. Then the nurse and gyno labeled the pieces of tissue 12, 6 so the circular one could be read by the pathologies. I wanted to see the tissue up close and they let me see it. Very small pieces over all. Then they put monsel solution on the area to prevent bleeding. This leaked out on a pad for days like coffee grinds as did a white clear fluid (part of wound healing they said). Had a recheck 2 weeks post op and gyno said all looked good. The pathology came back as CIN 1/2 ectocervix with normal endocervix cuttings and CLEAR MARGINS (so no need for cone at this time). Recheck in 6 months.

We texted a bit and when things went a little dry I took a leap of faith and told him I wasn‚Äôt a good texter with people I don‚Äôt know and would he be down to hang out after break. He immediately said yes and we texted for an hour, he was a little flirty and even talked about something he was gonna bring me at school. Saw each other at school the next day, not in class but at an assembly, and talked. Said bye, break started, he texted 2x and then left me on read.

We came back, and he didn‚Äôt look at me in class. I texted him how was break and did he still want to go out? He answered after 2 days and said yes but in a couple weeks. Still though he didn‚Äôt talk to me at school (he looked at me though.) 

Everything (lots of little stuff I left out) points to him being shy and not really knowing what I want from him, I think. It doesn‚Äôt feel like he‚Äôs playing games or trying to keep away from me.

by Preston Dennett

Face-to-face contact with a humanoid ET ‚Äì it‚Äôs one of the most astonishing experiences a person can have. And it‚Äôs occurring to a huge number of people. It‚Äôs been happening across the planet for a very long time. While our governments are now admitting that UFOs are real, they still refuse to talk about humanoids. The question is why? Is it because these kinds of encounters represent the forefront of UFO research and have much to teach us about this subject? This video presents ten incredible cases of face-to-face contact with humanoids. These include multi-witness cases with supporting evidence. The time for truth is now!

A SHOCKING EXPERIENCE. One summer morning in 1948, Ernst-August R. was minding his sheep in a rural area of Hemer, Germany. Suddenly his sheep scattered as a large saucer-shaped craft landed next to him. Ernst reached out and touched it. He was immediately shocked and passed out. Upon awakening, he was surrounded by strange humanoids. They spoke briefly then returned to their craft, which took off, leaving strange landing traces in the field.

A VERY LOUD UFO. One afternoon in July of 1960, railway worker Georges Godbout and his two co-employees were maintaining the tracks of the Canadian National Railroad near Chapais, Quebec, Canada. Suddenly a strange craft appeared over the tracks. It stopped and a humanoid wearing a green bodysuit came out. He started to look around, but seeing the witnesses, promptly returned into the craft. The UFO flew off with such a loud noise that it made the witnesses physically sick.

SPRAYED BY A UFO. On the afternoon of September 30, 1971, Anssi Hakala (age 11) was bicycling to his home in rural Marttila, Finland after visiting a friend. Suddenly a tall, thin, green-skinned humanoid appeared, levitating above his head. Anssi panicked and biked away. The being disappeared into a craft, which then began to pace Anssi on his bike, spraying him with a strange unidentified liquid.

THE LAUGHING ALIENS. At 5:30 pm on September 27, 1973, Antoine X (a mechanic) was out picking edible mushrooms not far from his home in Bedarrides, France. Movement caught his eyes and he observed what he thought were two small children. But they wore fully-body, beige jumpsuits, had very fine features and looked identical. When Antoine called out to them, they laughed and fled into the brush. Moments later, a metallic craft rose up and darted away.

UFO AT A YOUTH CAMP. At 9:30 pm on February 3, 1977, a group of kids from a youth camp at Seven-Mile-Beach in Tasmania, Australia spotted a classic flying saucer hovering at low elevation. It was covered with lights and had several portholes, and through one of the portholes, the children saw a strange humanoid with an oversized head looking down at them.

UFO LANDS AT SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. At 6:30 pm, Frank Sverre Mandte and Johnny Myrr (both age 11 and deaf) were approaching the Alm‚Äôs School near Honefoss, Norway, when they noticed a glowing object at low elevation by the nearby treeline. As they watched, it glided overhead, stopped, and then landed a short distance away. Both boys saw the figure of a humanoid looking down at them. The object took off, leaving behind undeniable landing traces.

ALIENS INSPECT FARMHOUSE. Just before 10pm on August 31, 1978, just as a power-outage struck the area of their home in La Dulce, Argentina, Manuel and Leonor Arias observed an oval craft with portholes hovering near their farm. It then ejected two very short figures with glowing red eyes who glided above the ground, came onto their property, and began to inspect their farm. They stayed for an hour. It was one of more than 20 encounters in the area around that time.

CHASED BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS. At 7:40 pm on September 21, 1978, an anonymous boy was walking through a construction site by his home in Cosenza, Italy when everything around him lit up like daylight. Looking around, he saw a strange craft landed on a nearby hill. A weird humanoid stood on top of it. Suddenly he saw four humanoids bounding towards him. He fainted and when he awoke, he was surrounded by the humanoids, each dressed in jumpsuits and helmets. He tried to fight them, fainted again, and when he awoke, they were gone.

AN ALIEN IN THE YARD. At 10:00 pm on the evening of November 24, 1988, Rune Asplund was drinking coffee in the kitchen his home in Daviken, Sweden when he observed a strange-looking figure just a few feet from his house, in his yard. The figure stood in a strange posture with its arms outstretched and its legs spread widely. It wore an unusual, shiny, metallic jumpsuit. Going outside to get a closer look, he saw the figure disappear into thin air. Rune later learned that a police officer saw a UFO the same night, which caused his cruiser to mysteriously stall. Rune also learned that a year earlier, his neighbor saw a strange, short humanoid, which disappeared the same way.

PLEASE TELL ME I‚ÄôM NOT CRAZY. It was 1:30 am one night in the summer of 1999 when a fourteen-year-old girl heard a deafening screeching noise right outside the window of her second-story bedroom of her home in Clarksburg, Massachusetts. Looking outside, she saw a strange three-foot-tall being with gray skin, a hairless head and black eyes. Her sister and mother also heard the scream, rushed into the bedroom, and saw it too. The creature remained for fifteen minutes before finally leaving. But it would soon return.

These ten incredible humanoid encounters show how very strange face-to-face contact can be. And these ten accounts represent just a small portion of the true number of encounters. So many cases. So many types of humanoids. So much evidence! The time for skepticism is now over. We are being visited by aliens.

1jqzuyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/B12_Deficiency/comments/1jqzuyy/supplements_and_strange_symptoms_is_b12_the/,"Supplements, and Strange Symptoms ‚Äî Is B12 the Problem or Am I Missing Something Else?","Since 2011, I‚Äôve been living with anxiety and panic disorder. I‚Äôve been taking Paroxetine (Seroxat) 25mg daily for over a decade, and it‚Äôs helped me manage fairly well. I‚Äôve gotten used to it to the point that I sometimes forget a dose or take it at a different time, and it‚Äôs never caused serious issues ‚Äî until recently.

A few months ago, I started a major lifestyle change focused on digestive health. I had been struggling with chronic constipation, so I began a daily routine of cleansing my system. Every morning I drank barley coffee with added black pepper, turmeric, ginger, cardamom, and saffron. I also supplemented with Vitamin C and oregano oil consistently.

Within weeks, I saw a big improvement in my digestion. Constipation nearly disappeared, and I felt like my body was finally starting to function properly again.

For years, I had avoided black coffee because even small amounts triggered palpitations, anxiety, tight chest, and an odd pulsing in my head and throat. I could only tolerate it diluted with ice and water. But after cutting out all stimulants ‚Äî coffee, tea, even barley coffee ‚Äî I noticed a big shift. Suddenly, I could drink one or two cups of strong black coffee without any of the usual symptoms.

Things were going well‚Ä¶ until the first major setback.

One day, I forgot my usual morning dose of Seroxat. Later that day, I had a bunch of sugary snacks ‚Äî chocolate, chips, sweets ‚Äî and took the medication afterward. A few hours later, I was hit hard: cold hands, intense abdominal heat and movement, dizziness, and a full-on panic attack. I rushed to the bathroom and vomited ‚Äî just water ‚Äî and immediately felt better.

But because I‚Äôve forgotten doses in the past with no major issues, I started to wonder if something else was going on. I decided to stop taking Vitamin C and oregano oil ‚Äî and surprisingly, after I stopped them, the nausea and vomiting never came back. That was the first time I thought these supplements might actually be doing more harm than good.

I went in for full lab testing, and the results were eye-opening:
	‚Ä¢	Vitamin B12: 137 pmol/L (Deficient)
	‚Ä¢	Vitamin D: 38.31 ng/mL (Low-normal but insufficient)
	‚Ä¢	Zinc: 67 ¬µg/dL (Low)
	‚Ä¢	Liver Enzymes:
	‚Ä¢	AST: 44.58 U/L
	‚Ä¢	ALT: 75.25 U/L
	‚Ä¢	GGT: 92.62 U/L
	‚Ä¢	LDL Cholesterol: Elevated
	‚Ä¢	Triglycerides: Elevated
	‚Ä¢	CRP (C-reactive protein): 9.95 mg/L (High ‚Äì indicating inflammation)
	‚Ä¢	HbA1C: 6% (Prediabetes range)
	‚Ä¢	Viome Gut Test showed:
	‚Ä¢	Imbalanced gut microbiome
	‚Ä¢	Poor digestion and nutrient absorption
	‚Ä¢	Low butyrate production
	‚Ä¢	Signs of inflammation in the gut
	‚Ä¢	H. pylori: 5/5 (very high presence)

After seeing all this, I started correcting deficiencies. I began with sublingual B12. It helped with muscle cramps and tension temporarily, but symptoms would return within hours. So I decided to try an intramuscular B12 injection ‚Äî 500mcg.

That‚Äôs when everything changed.

Within hours of the injection, strange symptoms started: constant tightness in my neck, throat, jaw, and tongue. Pain behind my ears, under my jaw, and a weird sensation that felt like something deep in my nerves was stretching and releasing over and over. I had difficulty swallowing and felt constant discomfort in my head and neck. It didn‚Äôt feel like normal anxiety. At first, I didn‚Äôt connect the dots, but once I reviewed the timing, it became clear: all of it began after the B12 shot.

After that, I became hyper-sensitive to nearly every new supplement I tried. Even ones that are considered ‚Äúsafe‚Äù or ‚Äúcalming‚Äù would give me heart palpitations, waves of anxiety, or nerve tension. I tried magnesium taurate ‚Äî supposedly calming ‚Äî but it made my heart feel jumpy and tight, so I stopped.

I experimented with probiotic foods:
	‚Ä¢	Kefir on an empty stomach gave me mild nausea, gas, and gut movement.
	‚Ä¢	Milk thistle caused gas but no strong discomfort.

Then, during Ramadan, I made a mistake. I ate a lot of chocolate and Saudi coffee at night. The next day for iftar, I had fried samosas, vegetable soup, luqaimat (sweet dumplings with honey), and more Saudi coffee. That night, the symptoms hit hard again: lump in my throat, neck tension, pain behind the ear, palpitations when lying down, bloating, arm and shoulder pain, insomnia, chills, hypersensitivity to sound, and even lower back pain.

That night I woke up in a panic, rushed to the bathroom, and vomited just water again ‚Äî no stomach pain. Later, I had diarrhea after days of constipation.

Cautiously, I resumed some supplements.
	‚Ä¢	Magnesium + B6 effervescent (twice daily)
	‚Ä¢	Half a capsule of a 50 billion CFU probiotic
	‚Ä¢	I also received Benfotiamine (B1) 150mg and P5P (active B6) 50mg, but I was too scared to start them due to my heightened sensitivity.

Before taking D3 + K2, I had cold hands and feet, palpitations, numbness in my neck, jaw, face, confusion, and head pressure. After D3 + K2, I felt mild relief.

Magnesium + B6 brought back cramping in my neck, jaw, and tongue ‚Äî along with more tension and brain fog. Waking up the next day, I still had dry eyes, some facial tics, and pain behind the ear.

I gave sublingual B12 another chance ‚Äî and it helped. About 90% of the tightness and cramping went away. My hands were warmer, dry eyes improved, and nerve spasms reduced by about 80%. I felt calmer ‚Äî not perfect, but better. Even pain in my right side eased after a bowel movement.

I also tried Magnesium Glycinate (200mg) ‚Äî initially it caused severe dryness in my mouth and eyes, but a few hours later I slept well and felt slightly better.
Magnesium Oxide + Malate didn‚Äôt cause dryness and gave temporary relief, though symptoms would return 4‚Äì5 hours later, so I took it every few hours.

Still, I‚Äôm left with lingering symptoms that haven‚Äôt gone away completely:
	‚Ä¢	Chronic muscle tension in the neck and jaw
	‚Ä¢	Lump in the throat
	‚Ä¢	Pain behind and beneath the ear
	‚Ä¢	Sensitivity to sound and light
	‚Ä¢	Mild chills in the neck and scalp
	‚Ä¢	Bloating and gas
	‚Ä¢	Subtle nerve-related symptoms that come and go

Staying on 100mg of magnesium 2‚Äì3 times a day has helped lessen the symptoms, but they haven‚Äôt fully disappeared. I still occasionally get:
	‚Ä¢	Mild burning in the tongue
	‚Ä¢	Subtle chills in the head/neck
	‚Ä¢	Throat tingling
	‚Ä¢	Strange tightness at the base of the tongue

Finally, I decided to try another B12 shot ‚Äî a smaller dose this time: 250mcg intramuscular. A few hours later, I experienced mild dizziness‚Ä¶ and then the symptoms started again:
throat tingling, tongue tension, chills in my head and neck, and that same ‚Äútight‚Äìrelease‚Äù nerve pattern. It‚Äôs like something deep inside keeps spasming ‚Äî tensing and relaxing repeatedly. It‚Äôs uncomfortable and honestly, frightening.

‚∏ª

I‚Äôm genuinely confused now. I don‚Äôt know if B12 is directly causing this, or if it‚Äôs due to another deficiency ‚Äî like B1, B6, or something else entirely.

I‚Äôve become afraid to try new supplements because of how unpredictable my body has become.
I just want to feel normal again.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? Could B12 be triggering these symptoms, or am I missing another crucial nutrient?

Any insight or shared experiences would really mean the world to me. Thank you for reading.

Advise me please!,"My wonderful boyfriend (M30s) and I (F30s) moved into an apartment together last Saturday for the first time. Both of us lived alone prior to moving in together and I knew he had a tendency to leave things out/not be as tidy as I am, but didn't think much of it. 

Tonight I put away his sleepy time tea in the kitchen cupboard and he asked me if we could keep it out on the counter so it's easily accessible to him. I, genuinely surprised, said, ""Is the cupboard not accessible enough?"" And he said it was ok to keep it in there.

He's truly a great partner. He's kind and he's supportive, but he's very untidy. He leaves empty bottles and cans out and prefers to hav everything on shelves rather than tucked inside cabinets and drawers.

I get overwhelmed and anxious by clutter, and we've talked about it before and he's been supportive, but it's not his natural instinct to put things away. 

I'm not a neat freak by nature either. Sometimes I leave dishes in the sink or don't make the bed, but I've become a cleaner, tidier person as I've matured and I like having at least a semi-neat space now that I'm in my 30s. It keeps me from being an anxious mess.  

We've only been in our place together for less than a week and are still unpacking, so I'm not mentioning it really because moving and unpacking are exhausting and I want to give him a chance to settle in too.

But I'd love some advice on how to approach it if it becomes a pattern. I don't want to constantly be nagging him to clean up after himself and put things away. And I also know I need to relax a bit.

Has anyone experienced this? Does it fix itself? My friend who has been married for many years said her husband was like this but grew to appreciate a clean, uncluttered home and encouraged me to just see if that happens with my boyfriend too. People tell me it often resolves itself. Did that happen for anyone here? 

I know we're adjusting to living together permanently instead of us each having our own apartments and I have the utmost love, compassion and respect for him, so I want to get ahead start on this issue internally so I don't come home after a bad day of work and get snippy at him for leaving empty coke bottles and other trash out on the coffee table or whatever.  

I appreciate all responses. Thank you for your help!

1jqzty3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1jqzty3/visible_vapor_time/,Visible vapor time?,"While boiling water in a standard stainless steel milk jug (open top, approx. 10 cm diameter), I happened to notice two intriguing phenomena under simple and reproducible conditions.
	‚Ä¢	Approx. 400 ml of filtered water was used.
	‚Ä¢	Heat was applied via direct flame until a continuous bubbling boil was reached.
	‚Ä¢	The environment was calm and draft-free, windows closed, ambient temperature stable.
	‚Ä¢	The jug was not covered, and no lid or insulation was used.
	‚Ä¢	I filmed everything in time-lapse mode (1 frame every 2 seconds), using a fixed tripod and natural lighting.
	‚Ä¢	The term ‚Äúvisible vapor‚Äù refers specifically to the white condensation cloud, not to invisible water vapor.

‚∏ª

First, I was surprised at how long it took for the water to stop visibly steaming after the heat was turned off.

Then, I found it even stranger that when I briefly turned the heat back on, the visible vapor quickly vanished, instead of increasing.

To better understand what I was seeing, I decided to frame a very basic experiment:
	1.	I heated the water to a full boil.
	2.	I turned off the heat and timed the persistence of visible vapor using the time-lapse footage.
	3.	Later, I turned the heat back on for a short time, then turned it off again.

The entire experiment took less than 40 minutes. There were no additions to the water (no coffee, sugar, salt, etc.) ‚Äî just pure boiling water.

Since I am not a physicist, I asked AI models, including ChatGPT, to explain the expected behavior of steam in such a setup.

That‚Äôs when things became interesting.

‚∏ª

ChatGPT (in Deep research mode) produced the following thought experiment prompt, which I reused with other AIs:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm conducting a thought experiment based on a real-life observation involving water and coffee being boiled. Under the official principles of thermodynamics, what would be the expected behavior of water vapor release when a pot of water with coffee reaches full boil and the heat source is then turned off? How long would vapor typically continue to be visible after the fire is turned off? What would be the maximum acceptable time for steam to keep rising without any heat being supplied, before the explanation becomes scientifically questionable? At what point would you consider it necessary to re-evaluate our current understanding of water vaporization if the steam continues for longer than expected? Also, if during the ‚Äúoff‚Äù period ‚Äî while steam is still visibly rising ‚Äî the fire is briefly turned on again, what would thermodynamics expect to happen? And finally, after turning the fire off again, what should be observed according to classical physics? Please answer based strictly on established scientific knowledge, without speculating beyond conventional explanations ‚Äî unless the observations clearly force reconsideration.‚Äù

In their standard version, all AIs responded that more than 10 minutes of visible vapor would be impossible under STP and without a heat source.
ChatGPT in Deep mode concluded that the maximum acceptable time should be a few tens of seconds, and that several minutes would already indicate something very abnormal.

‚∏ª

So here‚Äôs the key question:
According to classical thermodynamics, how long should visible vapor persist after turning off the heat under these controlled conditions?
And if reapplying heat briefly causes the vapor to stop ‚Äî why?

I‚Äôm not asking for explanations of what I observed. I‚Äôm asking:
What would be the expected behavior in theory?

2 c. (480 mL) unsweetened almondmilk, 2 scoops (62 g) ON Vanilla, 100 g Stonewall Kitchen Black Raspberry Jam, 5 g (2 tsp.) SF Jello Cheesecake, pinch of kosher salt, sweetener to taste

Blend, Fridge overnight, Freeze 24, Spin on Ice Cream, pop back in freezer at least 1 hr. before serving to harden

Historically, Black Raspberry is a hard-serve ice cream.

Take 1 cup finely milled almond flour, mix in 1/2 c. good 100% cocoa powder, 1 tsp. baking soda, 1/4 tsp. kosher salt, 1/2 cup toasted coconut, 1/2 cup honey, a pinch of coffee, 2 beaten egg whites, and 3/4 cup of dark chocolate chips. You may need a few tbsp. of water to ensure a spreadable consistency.

Lightly spray an 8""√ó8"" brownie pan and place a large enough piece of parchment paper in the bottom to overflow two sides. Gently spread your brownie batter then bake at 325 F for 30 minutes. Check doneness with toothpick. Cool and refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving.

You can mix a little water into Stonewall Kitchen Black Raspberry Jam to pour some over the top of your ice cream.

Last year I (M32) moved in with my grandmother (F98) after getting into graduate school, needless to say things didn‚Äôt necessarily go as planned.

Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love her and caring for her, seeing her happy, and continue to live a full life at her health fills me with immense joy. She‚Äôs always been a little spicy and more than a little self centered, which has only been amplified as nears 100. Again, love her to pieces but boy is she good at ripping your mental health to bits.

**Now as to what spurred this post?**

She‚Äôs been serving this neighbor (M, late 70s) of hers breakfast and dinner almost daily for the past 30 years. I don‚Äôt really enjoy interacting with him that much but it‚Äôs fine because he‚Äôs her friend and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs most important. But he just sits there while she literally serves him as if it‚Äôs the 1950s but she‚Äôs 98 man! Get up and pour your own coffee! She can barely hold the pot!

I digress. Anyway, tonight, I went downstairs to put her and his dishes away because he‚Äôd left. Just kidding he‚Äôs coming back for tea. (Note: it‚Äôs been a long day, she hasn‚Äôt had a nap, and had family visiting from out of town all day earlier)

I watch her almost fumble the electric kettle and think, ok, I‚Äôm just gonna hang out because she‚Äôs clearly tired and needs some help but won‚Äôt move unless she asks for it or *really* needs it - I had asked her and she said no.

Well, she puts the tea pot with this mornings tea in the microwave. I stop her. And let the screaming commence: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done this before! I know what I‚Äôm doing!‚Äù 

I go, ‚Äúok, grandma. I know, ok.‚Äù And she keeps screaming then tries to microwave the tea pot again.

At this point I move in and take the tea pot from her as gently as possible and bring it to the table. I pour the old tea into a mug and microwave it for a minute.

She continues to keep screaming at me, takes the tea pot, and then starts to pour water from the brita filter into it. I tell her the water is boiling for yours and your neighbor‚Äôs tea. More screaming but the tea pot has been placed down.

At this point, her irredeemable neighbor has already entered the house again, sat down, and listened to her rail at me for at least 5 minutes. And I‚Äôm just taking it, ‚Äúok. Yes. Of course you know what you‚Äôre doing,‚Äù as she paces around the kitchen huffing screaming at me, ‚Äúwhat are you doing! I don‚Äôt need your help! Go away! Screw you!‚Äù

Totally-not-taking-advantage-of-the-elderly neighbor just sits there and says **nothing**

By now, the water has boiled after she had stopped it and I restarted it - knowing why she was doing it in the first place - but having moved in front of the kettle because she has in fact burned herself multiple times in the past serving this still-just-sitting-there-neighbor. I really don‚Äôt want her to burn herself anymore. That‚Äôs why I cook breakfast and dinner for her most of the time.

I pour the slightly cooled, but still boiling water, into the tea pot and put the lid on. She screams at me, ‚Äúwhat are you doing!‚Äù Then flips the lid off and almost shoves her hand into the very much just under boiling temperature water. Fortunately I was fast enough to get more arm in and pull it away.

More screaming. I‚Äôm just standing there wondering what kind of wrong I must‚Äôve done to someone in my past life. She moves to the dining room and asks her neighbor, sweetly, mind you, ‚Äúdo you want some cookies with your tea?‚Äù

He says no. I think I might‚Äôve died a little inside, though.

More: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what the hell you‚Äôre doing! You must be doing that for yourself!‚Äù 

And I‚Äôm just muttering, ‚Äúyes I‚Äôm doing it for myself so I don‚Äôt watch you burn yourself‚Äù 

She finally moves to sit as I tell her I‚Äôm taking the tea pot. I walk around to the enter the dining room from the opposite side, ask her neighbor to keep an eye on the pot, then go up to my room.

After sitting in the dark, just breathing for 20 minutes, I figured this would at least be a decent throwaway story.

It‚Äôs a shame that I‚Äôm realizing this only now despite having watched the series multiple times since it ended in 2020, but I guess it‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt grow up knowing Charlie Rose, let alone watching any of his interviews. I also think that I‚Äôm at a much better headspace to be engaging with this show without taking it so personally lol.

But holy shit, watching the opening scene now adds more layers to the pilot. Back in the 90s, you know who else was in a very famous TV show? Charlie Rose. His interviews were very popular (in his website it says he‚Äôs had  6000+ interviews). In 2017 his show ended and career tanked because of sexual harassment allegations from multiple women, and BoJack meets the same fate toward the end of the show.

I find it interesting how this was clearly not planned by the creators since the pilot aired in 2014 and the #MeToo movement only got quite popular by 2017 when Harvey Weinstein got called out, along with other male celebrities like Charlie Rose. And looking at the timeline of episodes, we get a #MeToo reference in Season 2 with Hank Hippopopalous which was aired in 2015, so it‚Äôs likely that it was not even Charlie Rose‚Äôs life that inspired the creators to take on that path later in the series. But yeah, it‚Äôs weird how the passage of time has given BoJack and Charlie Rose more parallels, making this first scene a bit more jarring to watch.

I feel so disappointed in myself and I was really looking forward to celebrating my longest success so far. I had a few things I haven't gotten to do in a long time planned to celebrate as a reward (get my favorite coffee and go to dinner at one of my favorite restaurants and go to the beach to find seaglass) and I'm pretty bummed I feel like I can't do these things now on top of the disappointment in myself.

I was wondering if any of you guys have suggestions on how to remotivate myself to reach my big goals. My failure sort of makes me feel like ""what's the point now"". Realistically I know there's lot of reasons to continue to stay alcohol free, especially as I was drinking really really heavily, and withdrawing really bad when I wasn't. But when things are tough I was hoping to find some new skills to keep myself from feeling like there's no point now that I've ""ruined it all"". 

This is the longest I've gone in over 10 years, so even 97 days sober is a big deal but it's made me realize that I do need to be in AA. So I'll be adding that to my goals, but what can I do on my own time to keep these feelings away and keep myself feeling like it's worth it and not just work?

### Training
46M, 5‚Äô9‚Äô‚Äô, 165 lbs. 
Started running about 2 years ago as an attempt to lose weight. I was ~195 lbs then. Started with a c5k program and quickly fell in love with running and was able to shed 30 lbs since. 
Completed my first HM with 1:55 finish time Oct. 2024 and felt really good. A friend convinced me to try a full marathon and I signed up for the 2025 Napa Valley Marathon. 
For the training, I was following the Pfitz 18-55 plan plus 2x body weight strengthening a week. At the beginning the intensity of the plan felt too demanding for me, so I had to tune down some of the hard workouts. After 2 months of training, I found that I was able to keep up with the planned workouts. Mileage wise, I was quite strictly following the plan. My pace steadily improved with the training. 1 month out, Garmin predicted a sub 4hr marathon finish time. Things went really well until 3 weeks out from the race day. 2 days after my last 20 mile long run, I was doing the V8 w/ 5 x 600 @ 5K pace workout as planned. About 3 miles into the run, I felt a sharp pain on the outside of my right knee. I stopped running and basically walked back home. After some research, It felt most likely an IT Band issue. I read many of the posts on this subreddit and took some of the best advice (so a big THANK YOU here!) including rest for the last 3 weeks, specific strengthening routines, massages and stretches, KT Tapes, IT Band strap and Tylenol.  In the last 3 weeks, I only ran easy short distances once or twice a week just to test the recovery progress. 2 days before the race, I did a 3 mile run and my knees felt good. So I made the decision to give it a try.

### Pre-race
The hotels close to the starting line of NVM were really expensive, so I booked a hotel in Fairfield which is about 20 mins drive to the Vintage High School from where you can take the race shuttle to the starting line. 
I went to bed at 9:30PM and woke up at 4AM. Had 2 slices of bread with peanut butter and 2 cups of coffee for breakfast. Left the hotel at around 5AM and arrived at Vintage High School at 5:25. There were quite a lot of buses waiting. It took around 40 minutes for the bus to get to the starting line. Runners can stay in the bus to keep warm. The lines for the potties were around 15-20 minutes. In general, the race logistics were well run and things were quite smooth.
### Gears
New Balance SC Elite V4

Maurten gels: M160x4, M100x3

14oz handheld soft flask with Electrolyte

I was planning to use the ASICS MetaSpeed Sky Paris for the race because they gave me the best running efficiency from all the shoes I tested during my Sunday long runs. However, due to the IT Band issue, I decided to go with SC Elite. My thoughts were if the IT Band flares up during the race, SC Elite may provide better comfort and support to help me finish the race with pain. Other shoes I tested includes:

Adios Pro 4: they were too soft and even though they felt bouncy, it felt a little undirected and unreliable. So in the last several miles of my long run, my legs felt quite tired.

SC Elite V4: they are really comfortable and cushion, also very wide therefore most stable among the shoes. But compared to Sky Paris, they lacked the pop or energy return.

### Race
I took 1 gel 20 mins before the start time. I started with the 4:15 pacer group since I was worried about my knees. 3 miles later, my body felt pretty good, so I slowly picked up pace to around 9 min/mile. The course was really scenic and the weather was perfect: no sun, no rain, no wind and temp was mid 40. I felt really good before half way. Right after the 13 mile sign, I felt the urge to pee, so I spent around 30 seconds in the potty. There were potties on every water station, and no line after around 10 miles. After the 14 mile sign, I felt a minor pain on the outer side of my right knee again. I slowed down a bit and took a pill of Tylenol. I kept running, but slowed down a bit for the next 3-4 miles because of both worrying about the knee and also rolling hills. Soon, I passed the 20 mile sign. I realized that the pain never showed up again and I felt pretty good: no sign of hitting the wall, legs felt ok too. So I started to pick up my pace again. I actually ran the last 5 miles with ~8:45 min pace and finished 4:02. I brought 7 gels with me and took 1 gel every 3 or 4 miles. I also took a cup of water from each water station. I think this fueling strategy worked really well for me and maybe the main reason I didn‚Äôt hit the wall. 

### Post-race
I‚Äôm super happy and proud for the successful finish of my first marathon, especially that I was able to finish 4:02 3 weeks after the minor IT Band issue. I felt quite good after the race. IT Bands felt okay, no pain while I was walking or going up and down the stairs. Legs were pretty beaten up and very sore, but a lot better than I expected. 
Next step? I‚Äôm going to take a month break and then start a 5K/10K training block. After that, I may sign-up for my second marathon later this year or early next year.

Thank you all for reading. I want to thank everyone in the community for all the motivation, discussion and race reports that helped me tremendously since I started running seriously.

Has anyone had better success their second round with low AMH? Should I worry about egg quality with good outcomes the first time? No lifestyle changes this time around. Still drank my coffee, still ate moderately healthy (only eating out a few times a month), cut out alcohol. 

Someone talk me off the ledge. I feel like I‚Äôm spiraling today‚Ä¶.I know I should be grateful for the high number today, and I am, but I hear sad stories about more eggs meaning worse egg quality. UGH. What a mind game this all is!!!

1jqziey,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jqziey/elderly_grandmother_uses_destroy_mental_health/,Elderly grandmother uses destroy mental health,"Edit: skip to bold sentence for start of story

Last year I moved in with my grandmother after getting into graduate school, needless to say things didn‚Äôt necessarily go as planned.

Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love her and caring for her, seeing her happy, and continue to live a full life at her health fills me with immense joy. She‚Äôs always been a little spicy and more than a little self centered, which has only been amplified as nears 100. Again, love her to pieces but boy is she good at ripping your mental health to bits.

I was really only supposed to be here for two years max, but the level of care required was far beyond what I, or anyone in my family, really anticipated. Cooking, dr‚Äôs appts, groceries, random people she wants to meet because suddenly she can now bc her grandson is her with a car - whatever, I just do it because at her age it‚Äôs quite extraordinary and we want her to keep kicking.

The obvious problem was time constraints. The not so obvious problem is my mental health - diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and adhd. And while you might not necessarily notice because I can put on a good front, death by a thousand micro aggressions is very real when you can‚Äôt relax because you‚Äôre anxious both in public but also now at home. 

In the span of one year, I had to stop over 5 scam attempts - the last one requiring a full on nuclear approach: credit freeze, new account numbers, etc. I‚Äôve been helping her with her medicine for the past 7 months once she finally admitted she needed help and I had to count her pills to notice she either a) wasn‚Äôt taking them or b) was double dosing some days. And I also picked up doing her vitals every morning for the past 4 months.

And I was supposed to be doing graduate school while doing all of this? For reference, my other grandparents we got them private nurses before they passed and she‚Äôs long surpassed them in age.

**Now as to what spurred this post?**

She‚Äôs been serving this neighbor of hers breakfast and dinner almost daily for the past 30 years. I don‚Äôt really enjoy interacting with him that much but it‚Äôs fine because he‚Äôs her friend and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs most important. But he just sits there while she literally serves him as if it‚Äôs the 1950s but she‚Äôs 98 man! Get up and pour your own coffee! She can barely hold the pot!

I digress. Anyway, tonight, I went downstairs to put her and his dishes away because he‚Äôd left. Just kidding he‚Äôs coming back for tea. (Note: it‚Äôs been a long day, she hasn‚Äôt had a nap, and had family visiting from out of town all day earlier)

I watch her almost fumble the electric kettle and think, ok, I‚Äôm just gonna hang out because she‚Äôs clearly tired and needs some help but won‚Äôt move unless she asks for it or *really* needs it - I had asked her and she said no.

Well, she puts the tea pot with this mornings tea in the microwave. I stop her. And let the screaming commence: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done this before! I know what I‚Äôm doing!‚Äù 

I go, ‚Äúok, grandma. I know, ok.‚Äù And she keeps screaming then tries to microwave the tea pot again.

At this point I move in and take the tea pot from her as gently as possible and bring it to the table. I pour the old tea into a mug and microwave it for a minute.

She continues to keep screaming at me, takes the tea pot, and then starts to pour water from the brita filter into it. I tell her the water is boiling for yours and your neighbor‚Äôs tea. More screaming but the tea pot has been placed down.

At this point, her irredeemable neighbor has already entered the house again, sat down, and listened to her rail at me for at least 5 minutes. And I‚Äôm just taking it, ‚Äúok. Yes. Of course you know what you‚Äôre doing,‚Äù as she paces around the kitchen huffing screaming at me, ‚Äúwhat are you doing! I don‚Äôt need your help! Go away! Screw you!‚Äù

Totally-not-taking-advantage-of-the-elderly neighbor just sits there and says **nothing**

By now, the water has boiled after she had stopped it and I restarted it - knowing why she was doing it in the first place - but having moved in front of the kettle because she has in fact burned herself multiple times in the past serving this still-just-sitting-there-neighbor. I really don‚Äôt want her to burn herself anymore. That‚Äôs why I cook breakfast and dinner for her most of the time.

I pour the slightly cooled, but still boiling water, into the tea pot and put the lid on. She screams at me, ‚Äúwhat are you doing!‚Äù Then flips the lid off and almost shoves her hand into the very much just under boiling temperature water. Fortunately I was fast enough to get more arm in and pull it away.

More screaming. I‚Äôm just standing there wondering what kind of wrong I must‚Äôve done to someone in my past life. She moves to the dining room and asks her neighbor, sweetly, mind you, ‚Äúdo you want some cookies with your tea?‚Äù

He says no. I think I might‚Äôve died a little inside, though.

More: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what the hell you‚Äôre doing! You must be doing that for yourself!‚Äù 

And I‚Äôm just muttering, ‚Äúyes I‚Äôm doing it for myself so I don‚Äôt watch you burn yourself‚Äù 

She finally moves to sit as I tell her I‚Äôm taking the tea pot. I walk around to the enter the dining room from the opposite side, ask her neighbor to keep an eye on the pot, then go up to my room.

After sitting in the dark, just breathing for 20 minutes, I figured this would at least be a decent throwaway story.
