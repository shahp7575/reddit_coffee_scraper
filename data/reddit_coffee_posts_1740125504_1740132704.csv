1iunlum,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1iunlum/he_got_me_pregnant_asked_another_woman_on_a_date/,"He Got Me Pregnant, Asked Another Woman On A Date 3 Hours Later, I Found Out, He Blocked Me","TL;DR I got pregnant after my ex (B) and I had unprotected sex. I was using the oura ring and my cycle switched up bc I started taking vitex to make my periods less painful. He had taken me engagement ring shopping a month and a half prior, but we had issues after that bc I found someone else's hot pink glitter eyeshadow all over his sink and a blue rhinestone. I ended up miscarrying and found out he was involved with other women. He blocked me on everything without closure, refuses to return my belongings, has been spreading a smear campaign, and causing a lot of issues. I have become very ill from the stress and had to send him a cease and desist.

After he took me ring shopping, I found glitter and a rhinestone in his sink. When I asked if it belonged to his roommate’s girlfriend, the roommate said it didn’t. B then tried to stop me from leaving, begging me not to go. Later, he started picking fights, saying he couldn’t get over the fact that I almost left (even though I was just trying to get some space because he was screaming in my face). He accused me of not trusting him and became more verbally abusive over time. Eventually, he broke up with me, claiming we’d get back together once he started his business, but that he just didn’t have time for me. He also said he was dealing with mental health issues but refused to go to therapy. The night he dumped me, I went out with friends and went bar hopping. After drinking, it hit me late at night—“What if I’m pregnant? We had unprotected sex.” So I took a test, and it was positive.

I started having a mental breakdown. I was hyperventilating. My worst fear was getting pregnant, and B knew that. My previous abusive ex (A) had sexually assaulted me. He also had a history of doing that to other women. A got me pregnant and I ended up miscarrying. It took me a long time to heal from that experience. When I got involved with B, I made it very clear from the beginning that I was terrified of getting pregnant. He spent a lot of time reassuring me that he would never leave me, even after we had unprotected sex.

  
That night, I tried texting B, but he was asleep and didn’t respond. My friends ended up bringing me more pregnancy tests to take. The next day, B finally replied, saying if I was pregnant, we’d figure it out and that he still liked me. But over the next week, he acted really strange. He called me about 7 times a day, almost every day, sexted me, and acted like we were still together. Then, things took a dark turn. He said some really hurtful things to me, like ""I don’t love you,"" and ""You should get an abortion."" Later, he backtracked and told me he didn’t mean any of it, claiming he just wanted to make it easier for me to move on. 

Despite all of that, we got back together— even though we were already acting like we were together, and he kept insisting there was no one else. He acted weird about putting our relationship status back on Facebook. Eventually, he did update it, gave me a gift basket, and wrote me an apology letter full of the same excuses: that his biggest regret was dumping me, that he wanted to focus on his business, and that he was struggling mentally. He claimed he was excited about the baby and that we’d figure everything out.

Then things started to get even sketchier. He began treating me badly, telling me he’d rather play video games than spend time with me. At one point, while I was pregnant, he even said, “Life would be better if you were dead, haha.” I later found out that he had searched ""local hookups (his city)"" on Reddit, which I discovered through a local Facebook group was actually linked to prostitutes. He told me he had only been looking up porn the night we broke up, but I knew it didn’t make sense. The group he searched was local and had no photos—it was more than just porn. He was worried I’d tell his family about it. When I confronted him, he screamed in my face and told me to get out of his house. After a while, he calmed down. I was terrified because I was still pregnant, and I didn’t know where to go or what to do.

I ended up miscarrying after two months. He pretended to be supportive, but it was a struggle to get him to disconnect from his video games and come upstairs to be there for me while I was going through it. He told me everything would be okay and that we could try for kids again someday. I tried to hold on to those moments where he seemed supportive, but it was hard to ignore the feeling in my gut telling me that something wasn’t right.

Toward the end, he screamed at me and put his hand over my mouth after I found nudes of a ""friend from Tinder 5 years ago"" saved on his phone. I had told him it wasn’t appropriate, especially since they had a history of flirting and sending each other nudes, and I didn’t want him to have her on his Snapchat. After putting his hands on me, he apologized and promised he’d delete her. But just a few days before, he had threatened to delete *me* for her.

He asked me to visit him the weekend after he put his hands on me, and I felt terrified to go. Later, I found out through a “Are We Dating the Same Guy?” post that he had dumped me because he wanted to ask another woman out on a date. He had gone out with her while we were together and decided he wanted to pursue her. He lied to me and tried to keep me on the hook for sex, saying he’d want me back later. Only three hours after I told him I was pregnant and he promised we’d figure it out together, he asked her out, started talking to her about ""settling down"" and having a long-term relationship. She had no idea I was pregnant or that we were ever together. It hit me that he had been lying to me for months. Instead of being a responsible adult and supporting me, bringing me more pregnancy tests, he was in another woman's DMs.

I confronted him about everything. He tried to gaslight me at first and told me he had ""just asked her out for coffee as a friend."" When I told him I had the screenshots, he screamed at me and wouldn’t let me say anything. He called me “psychotic” and said he never wanted me in his life again. He told me he didn’t believe I was ever really pregnant and suggested that I must’ve used a two-year-old pregnancy test from when my other ex sexually assaulted me. He had never told me before that he thought I was lying about the pregnancy.

After all of that, he blocked me and ghosted me without giving me any real closure. Later, I found out from multiple women that he had been on Tinder while we were together. A lot of them said he’d been on Tinder from the time he took me ring shopping until the end of our relationship. One woman told me he claimed he was in an “open relationship” (which wasn’t true) and that he was a pilot (he wasn’t—he was just visiting me). This was a week after he found out I was pregnant and after we got back together. It was the same day he gave me the apology gift basket.

I tried reaching out to him, offering to provide proof that the pregnancy was real. I also told him how awful he had treated me and asked for my things back. But he blocked me at every turn. So, I decided to contact his mom to explain what had happened (that I was pregnant, he cheated on me while I was pregnant, and he had put his hands on me) and to ask for my belongings since he lived in one of the houses she owns. She never responded, refused to look at any of the evidence, and his whole family unfriended me on everything.

His ex-girlfriend (the one he supposedly ended things on good terms with) told me he was narcissistic. She tried reaching out to his brother to help me get my things back. His brother, who barely knew me, called me “crazy” and told her to ignore me. I also tried contacting his old roommate, who still needed to pick up his things, and another friend of his to get my stuff back. But as soon as I reached out, he would immediately call them, telling them I was “crazy” and to ignore me. So, I sent them screenshots of everything that had happened, asked not to be dismissed, and continued to press the point that I just wanted my things back.

At one point, his friend got really rude, so I told her that if he didn’t send my things back, my only options were to send a cease and desist or do a civil standby. My ex immediately called my mom and yelled at her over the phone. My mom had previously tried to ask him to send my stuff back and even told him I was pregnant, but he had apparently blocked her. Asking for my things back was like pulling teeth. He sent my mom photos of my lingerie, saying I “barely had anything there” and shouldn’t expect him to send anything back. My mom offered to pay for the postage. He finally said he could leave my stuff outside for me to pick up. My mom told him I didn’t feel comfortable doing that or driving 1.5 hours to get it. His response? “Good, because I would’ve called the cops on her anyway.” He then said he’d told his neighbors to keep an eye out for me. He told my mom he had never cheated on me, threatened a restraining order, and even threatened a defamation suit (even though I had screenshots and evidence of everything). He said he’d only send my stuff back if I stopped talking to him, his family, and his friends, which is ironic since some of his friends have added me after the breakup and have been talking to me. 

He was basically trying to control who I could talk to and stop me from telling the truth. In the end, my lawyer sent him a cease and desist to demand my things back, to tell him to stop making threats and trying to intimidate me, and to stop discrediting me. It’s been over a month, I’ve tried reasoning with him, I’m tired of being smeared, and I’m emotionally exhausted.

At this point, I’ve realized that him screaming in my face was completely unacceptable. It was a clear sign of him lying and was a form of abusive communication. But at the same time, I’m struggling because there was also a lot of good in him throughout much of our relationship. We bonded over so many things—our values, hobbies, religion, and life goals. I never imagined he was capable of any of this, and it’s been really hard for me to accept. I’ve been struggling for the past month and a half, trying to move past everything. I’ve been grieving the loss of our baby alone, and now I’m having to come to terms with the reality of who my ex really is. The stress has made me so physically ill that I’m now going to TRE and physical therapy for muscle tension. Meanwhile, he’s been chatting with other women on Reddit under posts asking for titty pics, using the same line he used with me: “Hello fellow fish keeper!” He seemed so nice for so long, and now it’s just hard to process how he turned out.

just keep wondering: was any of the relationship real? Does he truly think I wasn’t pregnant? How could he do all of this to me? Why is he acting like I’m the threat when he’s the one who has harmed me? My mind has been looping these thoughts over and over, trying to find some peaceful solution for the past month and a half. I dreaded sending that cease and desist, but I didn’t know what else to do. Part of me doesn’t want to accept that he’s really harmed me. I keep wondering—what if this is all just a misunderstanding?

I’m really struggling right now and I’m desperately seeking any advice from people who have been through similar situations. I’d really appreciate hearing how you dealt with it, how you started healing, and any insights you can share to help me understand what I’m going through. I feel stuck and emotionally drained, and I just don’t know what to do next.

1iunlr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1iunlr3/troubled_marriage_after_only_2_months/,Troubled marriage after only 2 months,"I (27F) recently got married to my best friend and current husband (24M). We have been good friends for 2 years then he confessed to me and expressed that he had feelings for me all throughout the past 2 years when I just saw him as a friend. I was very hesitant but after a month of thinking and considering this potential relationship I said why not? Why should I give this good guy a chance? And I agreed to be his girlfriend. We dated for 4 more years after deciding to tie the knot in late 2024. We did have ups and downs in our relationship and I had always complained about some specific communication issues we have but I decided to always see the bigger picture and that overall he was still a decent guy. Issues between our respective families started to arise a bit after the engagement party. His mother started to show signs of narcissism and superiority complex and she would often say insensitive comments which could be hurtful. For Instance, in the engagement party which over 45 people attended she was given the mic and said: ""I believe my son is too young, he's still very young and I just can't say no to my kids"" (in fact he had to cry and protest for them to agree that he married me because they were against the idea the first time he brought it up). And every time we gather for lunch or just a coffee she had to mention again that his dad was strongmu against this marriage and she begged and convinced him to finally agree. On the wedding day, she was ordering my mother around: Do this, give me that etc. and my mom was already fed up with her but just stayed composed to not hurt me or my husband. I cried on my wedding day because his mom was rushing everyone to serve dinner very soon and therefore I had to show up in the wedding hall without the presence of my sister nor closest friends. I feel so pressured to do things the way she wanted because she was paying for the food and dj expenses while I paid for my clothes and offered the venue. While I was changing into different outfits she kept coming in and out my room and not even once had she smiled at me or said I looked fine or just nice. To add insult to injury she 'accidently' spilled 2 cups of juice on my rented dress and I had to stop the ceremony of Henna and run to the changing room to get the next outfit. That dress was the one I was looking forward to the most and couldn't even get family pictures with it. With many more stressing small events, the wedding eventually ended and we went to a hotel we booked. In Moroccan traditions there is a second day celebration that the bride's mother organises on the 1st official day as a newlywed bride. We went to my mom's and she had already prepared plenty of food and delicious sweets to welcome us as a newly married couple and the groom's family as well. My mom asked his mom what to do with the huge amount of left over food that because of the caterer went almost all bad. His mom suddenly goes into a hysterical mode, screaming and shouting. She shouted racial slurs and made me and my family feel like nothing. The scene was too shocking that my husband went upstairs crying and all his siblings and her family were crying without saying a word. She kept screaming and ranting for nearly 2 hours while my mom decided to not say anything back and stayed quiet the whole time feeling bad for all my in-law family crying. It was traumatic to say the least. After saying every toxic, insensitive degrading and hurtful comment possible, his mom left and affirmed that she will not mend things unless my mother who has been quiet this whole time kisses her forehead and apologizes. The days following the incident were just filled with confusion and almost denial of what happened but later it hits. And it hit me hard! I was crying almost every night because of this. Especially that my husband just wanted to pretend like nothing happened and disregard the hurt and humiliation my family and I had to suffer from. My mother went into a depressive state where not only she misses me, she was insulted and reduced to nothing without a chance to retaliate and she is very concerned about the hardships I will most likely face dealing with such a rude and narcissistic mother-in-law. I did not feel any support from my husband because for him, I'm making a big deal out of nothing. He is an overall good husband, he helps me with house chores and gets me nice gifts and gestures here and there but I feel like none of this matters to me of I don't feel emotionally safe and protected. I was forced to go visit his family and his mom because he would fell upset and hurt if I don't. Moreover after 2 years I'm realizing his stomach issues and eating preferences and neat-freak habits are adding more pressure on my shoulders. I'm at a point where I don't know if marriage is supposed to be this hard, or if I just married the wrong person in the wrong family. I don't feel loved, I'm loosing joy in the smallest things in life. I still cry every now and then feeling stuck and unsure about this marriage anymore because I don't feel heard nor understood. Because he doesn't have the courage to tell his mother what she did was wrong on so many levels, I will be meeting her tomorrow to tell her exactly how I feel and I'm really not sure which way it will go. I'm scared I'm ruining a potentially good marriage after only 2 months. What do you think?",1,1740132646.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

**DIY:**

This coffee’s unique textures are achieved through careful layering. It begins with a base of MCT oil and cocoa powder, stirred together for a rich foundation. Next, most of the frothed heavy cream is added—frothing heavy cream can be tricky, but I use a Safecourt milk frother for a smooth consistency. The freshly brewed French press coffee is then poured directly into the center of the glass at a steady, moderate speed. Since French press coffee has a slightly uneven consistency, it partially blends with the cream, creating a rich brown gradient with delicate bubbles. The uppermost layer forms a dark rim as the thinner coffee integrates with the heavy cream, producing a striking large-bubble effect. Finally, the drink is topped with the remaining frothy cream and a dusting of cinnamon for a perfect finish.

**Ingredients:**

Freshly grinded French pressed Arabica coffee beans  
100 ml of frothed full fat heavy cream  
10 ml of MCT oil  
5\~g of cocoa powder  
and a dash of cinnamon

I'm no expert but here are some things that helped me on the day:

Morning routine: I woke up, showered, had something light for breakfast with a coffee. And then sat and watched a few last minute videos on YouTube regarding the maneuvers I could be asked to do and videos on observations.

If you're doing the test in your car:
Make sure the car is spotless, check you have a mirror for the instructor and check you have L plates attached to the car with a spare set in the boot for peace of mind. Put your provisional and theory pass certificate in an envelope and put it in the glove box ready for your test. I put blind spot mirrors on the wing mirrors and aimed them down so I can always see the back wheels which makes reverse parking so much easier.

Drive to the test center early and last minute practice:
I drove to the test center and aimed to get there about 45 mins early. We found a car park close to the test center and done last minute reverse bay park, front bay park and also parallel park. I mentally pretended that my test started from the moment I left my house.

Park in a convenient area: when parking outside the test center, park facing out and in a good position that allows you to start your test easily. You don't want to be reversing out of a bay or creating extra maneuvers for yourself. 

First impressions:
Take a seat in the waiting area at the test center and make sure you are sitting and waiting 10 minutes before your test is scheduled to start. When the examiner calls your name smile and introduce yourself, shake their hand etc. On the way out of the waiting area hold any doors for them and just be generally polite. You should be polite like this in every walk of life but if you are going through a bad time in life then put that to one side today.

Listen to what they have to say: they may ask you ""would you like me to discuss how the test will take place today"" say yes and listen to what they have to say so you are clear about what is expected of you.

You will now read a car number plate as a sight test and then make your way to your car. The examiner will walk around and check the tread depth on your tyres and a general inspection. 

They may ask you to do a ""show me"" question at this point. For example ""open the bonnet and show me where brake fluid is and how do you know if you have sufficient brake fluid"". Make sure you have practiced these show me tell me questions, you don't want to give away a silly minor for getting these wrong.

When you get in the car with the examiner: ask them if they are comfortable. If you have a dash cam then offer to unplug it before they ask you to( my examiner didn't mind the dash cam being on because the audio was muted). 

The examiner will put a TomTom on the dash and the test will commence. Try to keep calm throughout, make the examiner feel comfortable, go over speed humps nice and slow. Aim for a nice smooth ride. Make plenty of clear observations with head movement to make it clear you are making lots of observations. 

You will be asked to pull up on the left multiple times during your test. You want to do a full 360 check around every mirror and blind spot finishing with blind spot and mirror on your right hand side ( the side you are pulling out into).

Always stay a few miles per hour below the speed limit to give you allowence to make sure you don't creep over the speed limit but do not go anymore than 5mph slower than the speed limit if the conditions allow you too ( if you have no cars infront on a straight and clear road with ideal weather conditions then you shouldn't be going any slower than 5mph below the speed limit)

Keep an eye out for cyclists. I was close to entering a roundabout when a cyclist was approaching from the right on the roundabout, I stopped behind the give way line in time but saw them later than I would of liked because they were dressed in black head to toe on a black bike and were camouflaged to the black road. It's easy to miss these things when all of your attention is focused on the test.

Be considerate of road users. If you are going down a narrow road and you have cars parked on your side of the road causing an obstruction then you need to give way to on coming traffic by stopping behind the parked cars. When's it's clear check your rear view mirror, right mirror and right blind spot before moving off

If you make a wrong turn don't worry about it, you won't be given a minor for this. Carry on and follow the sat nav until you are back on course. 

If it helps you then talk yourself through your movements during the test. For example the examiner might say ""pull up on the left when it's safe to do so"" then while you are looking for a spot to pull up you could say "" I can't park here because it's a zig zag yellow line for a school... This spot looks safe and is well clear of the no parking area"" for me it really helped me concentrate and it shows your intentions to the examiner.

Observations are extremely important, make sure to make observations when you are on a roundabout, doing maneuvers, pulling off. Practise and get in the habit of making the correct observation at the correct time.

Before you know it the test will be over and you will be back at the test center. Don't get too excited and keep focus until the car is safely parked. You dont want to mess up at the last hurdle.

The examiner will now tell you if you passed or failed. Good luck everyone, just make sure you are well prepared and try to keep relaxed and you will be fine. The driving exam is not the end of the world if you fail. Don't make yourself sick with worry.

YouTube videos that helped me:

DGN driving school channel uploads excellent videos that will help. He is calm, clear and concise. Specifically check the mock driving tests of people that pass the mock test so you can see their observations and how they drive to achieve a pass. Also watch the videos of people failing their mock tests so you can see where a lot of people go wrong and make sure you don't do the same.

1iunhht,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1iunhht/fasting_causing_leaky_gut_disbyosis/,Fasting causing leaky gut / disbyosis?,"Hey so-

About 3.5 months ago, I did a 4 day water fast (with coffee)
At about day 3 I started feeling pain in my upper teeth, between teeth and sinuses.

After finishing the fast I went to the dentist he said my teeth are fine.
The ENT doctor said my sinuses are fine.

I started noticing the pain definitely flares up after foods like dairy, gluten and pro inflammatory foods.

When I don’t eat them (like if I eat only fruit) the pain subsides.

I gave all evidence to charGPT trying to figure out what I have

Chat said that one option is that during the fast the gut biome did not have fuel so they started munching on my gut lining, creating small holes and a leaky gut. Now when I eat inflammatory foods some of it leak through into my bloodstream, and I just feel it in the sensitive nerve behind my teeth. 
Chat said another option is gut disbyosis that happened due to fasting.

I hope this post doesn’t anger members of this sub, I am too in favor of fasting and it gave me a lot (even just a new relationship with the feeling of hunger is a huge thing for me). I am however open to the possibility that it might have a flip side. I mean if it is the powerful tool we think it is, it means it’s a powerful tool, meaning when used not accurately it is sensible that it can cause damage.

Was wondering if anyone here experienced something similar or if it makes sense from a medical point of view. And if so- what was the problem with my fast/ how to ensure this won’t happen next time I fast.

1iun5st,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1iun5st/something_sinister_lived_within_my_paintings/,Something Sinister Lived Within My Paintings,"‘Tom went mad,’ Gilbert said. ‘Schizophrenia or something, I think. He stopped leaving the place completely. After a month of being pent up inside he died of starvation.’ 

‘He was a hoarder. A serious one. It took weeks to get the home cleaned up, and even then there’s still some junk in the basement the cleaners left there. I’d be curious to have a look and see if there’s anything valuable.’ He snorted. ‘I doubt it though.’ 

I sorted through what remained of the clutter and determined most of it to be worthless. There were shelves full of dusty tools and stacks of used furniture. Shoved up against the wall was a large mattress with dirty, stained sheets and old clothes piled on top of it. 

There was one thing I uncovered which did catch my attention. In the far back corner of the basement something was hidden underneath a white sheet: a chest, turned back to face the wall. Within the chest I discovered a diary and a stack of paintings.. 

I skimmed through the diary first. Below I’ve copied out some of the stranger entries as I read them:

\-

*I had one of the oddest experiences of my life today.* 

*It started with a dream. From what I could recall I was fleeing from something. I don’t remember what it looked like. I know it was huge - on a cosmic scale. And it wasn’t supposed to exist. I’m not sure if that makes sense but describing the thing at all is difficult for me.* 

*I woke up from the dream with my head throbbing and sweat covering my body. My throat was dry and raw. My ears were ringing. Something felt wrong.* 

*When I went outside the following morning what I saw was bizarre. It looked like a bolt of lightning had struck the ground at the edge of the stretch of hayfields extending past my backyard. The immediate section of corn was blackened and withered, the corn further out a sickly brown color.* 

*In the center of the circle of scorched earth sat a hand sized stone totem. Four uncanny faces decorated each of its sides. They appeared almost but not quite human. Two were screaming, the other two bore grins which extended unnaturally wide. The piece of stone was stained on one side with a blotch of reddish brown.* 

*-*

The previous homeowner took the totem back to his house and put it in the basement. The next couple of entries deliberated over various other aspects of his life. I was intrigued enough to keep skimming through the diary and my curiosity was soon rewarded. 

\-

*Something happened to one of my paintings. I’m writing this down to help me understand it.* 

*I have owned the painting for years. It has been here since before my parents moved in. It’s the type of thing you live with for such a long time you never really notice it. Yet now every time I sit in the room with it I swear I can feel the painting watching me.* 

*-*

He went on to describe the painting - an old man sitting on a table with a walking stick in one hand, the other holding a pair of spectacles up to his eyes. When he had examined it closer, Tom noticed something about the painting had changed. 

\-

*The man looks different. He looks scared. And there is a long, tall shadow in the shadows behind him, only barely visible, but it's definitely there.* 

*After a couple days I took it off the wall and put it away in the basement. That was when I noticed the idol had fallen off the shelf it had been sitting on. It has shattered into several pieces.* 

*The idol no longer gave off the sense of malice it did when I found it. But that’s not to say the feeling has gone - it hasn’t.* 

*-*

*-*

*I went back down to the basement. I checked on both the remains of the idol and the watercolor painting. I previously described my discomfort being around the portrait of the old man but that instinct is gone now. The painting itself appears normal again. Just an old man staring at the viewer with an expression suggesting him to be deep in thought.* 

*Upstairs I have a couple of other portraits hanging up around my house. One is of a little waterfall in a forest. Now out of the corner of my eye I swear I can see something staring out at me from in between two trees within the painting.* 

*I thought it had to be my imagination but when I succumbed to paranoia and took a closer look I realized it wasn’t. When I peered close enough I caught the shadow of something tall in the trees, hunched over to the side at an odd and unnatural angle.* 

\-

\-

*More of the portraits in my house have been changed. These changes are both subtle and unnerving. What is stranger is that when one painting changes, the others change back. The shadow of the thing inside the waterfall painting has disappeared.* 

*I want to know if what is going on here can be explained rationally. And if it can’t, I want to understand what the hell this thing is haunting me.* 

*-*

*-*

*I’ve thought about it and I believe getting rid of the remains would be wisest. I can’t emphasize enough how uncomfortable it is to share a house with it - the thing possessing my paintings, which must be somehow connected to the fetish.* 

*I hate being around the paintings once they’ve changed. They’re not so bad after they’ve changed back, but whichever painting possesses the visual anomalies feels alive. Not just alive, but hostile. I honestly feel like the thing inside the paintings despises me.* 

*I’m not overly superstitious but I’d be an idiot to deny there was something evil about the idol I discovered out there.* 

*-*

*-*

*Getting rid of the idol didn’t work. Getting rid of all of the paintings I’ve spotted changes in didn’t work. It keeps switching between other portraits all around the house.* 

*The most recent one it took possession of is a landscape portrait of a small, old fashioned neighborhood from the 1930s. Something is staring out at me through one window, no more than a hazy blur in the greyness of the glass. I took it down and put it away with the other ones.* 

*-*

The following entries described how it moved from one image to another. Tom subsequently developed a phobia of being around portraits and avoided them religiously, going as far as to lock every painting he owned away in his basement. 

His entries became less and less coherent. He discussed how his world was falling apart. The account he wrote painted a sad picture of a depressed and lonely man who needed help but didn’t know how or where to get it.   

I could hardly make sense of the last couple entries. They read like the ramblings of a madman. I wasn’t surprised since Gilbert told me he had been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses in the years leading up to his death.  

Tom scoured his house repeatedly looking for paintings. He claimed to discover different pictures hanging off of his walls every couple of weeks. It became a daily ritual to check his house to make sure no new ones had appeared. He was convinced something awful would happen if the wraith (as he had begun calling it) was left outside of his basement for too long. 

This was where the readable part of the journal ended. The remaining entries were impossible to make sense of. 

I took the journal upstairs and sorted through the paintings. They were the same ones the author described. 

The one at the bottom of the pile was a depiction of a procession of gaunt soldiers from what looked to be WW2, trudging over the remains of a weathered battleground. The soldier’s eyes were fearful and haunted, their faces stark white. 

This photo scared me in an inexplicable way. The longer I looked at it the more mad and deranged the faces of the soldiers appeared. The sensation I felt while around it mirrored the one the author had described - a steadily growing sense of uneasiness which made it difficult to gaze upon the painting for too long. 

One of the first things I did with the portrait was take a photo of it on my phone. Tom had done the same thing a couple of times previously and made a dubious claim. According to him, the effects the portrait had on him didn’t extend to photos of it, no matter how many he took. 

He was right. The portrait looked distinctly different on camera. The faces of the soldiers appeared more grim rather than haunted and the one furthest to the back of the procession wasn’t grinning in a deranged way the way he was in the original picture. 

I took a couple more photographs, still not quite able to believe it, but they all showed the same thing. 

At a housewarming party I showed the war portrait to some friends. They each shared my discomfort when they looked at it. Some of them didn’t get the feeling of dread I described immediately but one by one they each succumbed to it. 

When I showed them the photos they confirmed the differences I noticed were real. They complimented me on my photo editing skills and I had to explain to them that I didn’t do any of this. When I proved the fact by taking another photograph one of my friends came up with an interesting theory. He suggested a special kind of paint could have been used to make the painting appear different in the light of the camera as a picture was being taken. 

Keen to get to the bottom of the mystery, I began testing some of the other claims made by Tom in his diary. I placed the WW2 portrait next to a collection of creepy photos I’d found online and printed out.

The first time it happened was with a photo of a pale, angular face leering out of a dark background. I couldn’t say precisely when it occurred but the wraith took possession of the photo. What had once been a piece of paper with a generic scary image printed on it was now a dark, almost oppressive presence lying on my desk beside me. 

Something else happened, too. The WW2 portrait changed subtly. The soldiers' faces now looked like they did in the photos I took of the portrait. It worked just as Tom had described in his journal. 

Whenever I wasn’t looking directly at one of the photos I could swear the face in it had turned around to stare at me . I frequently looked to check this wasn’t the case but this did little to curb my anxiety.

The effect of the photos seemed to be cumulative over time, the longer the wraith inhabited one photograph. It began as a persistent and intrusive feeling of uneasiness. The longer I spent around the photographs the more they troubled me. The white, angular face began showing up in the corner of my eye. I began to understand why Tom spoke of the portraits the way he did and why he hid so many of them away in the basement. 

If I shared the same room as the wraith I couldn’t bring myself to remain turned away from it for too long - or to look at it for too long, either. And I wasn’t the only one who felt that way. My friends all shared the same sentiment. Once we played a game to see who could look at one of the possessed photos for the longest. The best of us lasted nine minutes before shuddering, turning away and leaving the room. 

There were things the wraith could do which Tom never learned about. But I did. All of what I’d seen so far was only the beginning of what the wraith was capable of. 

One rainy day when I was stuck on a class assignment I elected to take a break and went out to get a coffee. When I came back I noticed something looking back at me from my computer screen which hadn’t been there before. 

It didn’t take me long to pick out the subtle differences in the photo on my screen and deduce what had happened. The wraith had transferred itself onto my computer. What I was looking at was a digital copy of the same leering face I showed you earlier. 

No copy I made of the image file replicated the cognitive effects of the possessed image or the visual differences the wraith had made to it. Modifying the image itself didn’t do anything at first. When I changed it too much the wraith abandoned the image and reattached itself to another one in the same folder. 

I put another image into a parent directory, deleted the possessed one and waited for a response. I didn’t have to wait long. The wraith did what I’d predicted it would do, moving to the image in the other directory. 

A couple of days later I managed to get it inside of a gif. The image depicted a girl standing and staring at her reflection. The animated loop was of the reflection leaning forward and beginning to push its face into the other side of the mirror. The wraith added an extra second to the end of the gif showing the reflection melting through the glass on the girl’s side of the mirror while reaching out for her. This difference was disturbing enough on its own, but I could have sworn the gif was changing a little more each time it played on my screen. 

From time to time the gif would pop up on screen unprompted, stuck in its ceaseless repetition. I began to feel a vague sense of dread while using my computer as I feared another occurrence of the wraith flashing up on my screen. It was a stupid thing to be scared of but I struggled to shake the feeling off. 

Recently I’d watched a slasher flick and I decided to see if the wraith would interact with it. 

Like with the other media there were tangible differences in the possessed version of the film. The murder scenes were more graphic and lasted longer. The movie concluded with a ten second shot of the murderer staring into the camera expressionlessly with no music or noise. 

Upon watching the movie for a second time several more scenes played out where various characters stopped, fell silent, and stared into the screen as the murderer had done. 

The movie mutated further each time I watched it. Scenes became glitched and the subtitles turned into an incomprehensible jumble of characters from a language I couldn’t identify.  

After showing the movie to my friends, they were as unable as I was to explain what they saw. They had seen enough to be convinced the wraith was real, even if I wasn’t so sure of the fact myself. However, none of us were scared by the idea - we were fascinated. 

We were debating what it meant when one of them brought up an intriguing suggestion. 

This little group of ours was in the middle of working on a horror game. It was a passion project the five of us - George, me, Nick, Hayden and Matthew - had envisioned during our first year together at college.  

‘The wraith can inhabit all kinds of media,’ George said, leaning in. ‘What if it could inhabit a video game?’

At his urging, I moved the possessed movie file into the game folder on my computer. When this didn’t have an effect, I deleted the file the wraith had possessed. It turned up in an image file again - this time, a texture within the game.

The game we were working on was an exploration of a large, liminal landscape. There was little story or background - just wandering through an eerie world with an atmosphere inspired by titles ranging from the old Silent Hill games to ActiveWorlds. 

Even though little in the game had been tangibly changed, playing it was a totally different experience. There was an unshakable sense something was hidden in the game with us. Something which wasn’t supposed to be there. 

George in particular was blown away by what the game had become. He got it into his head that we had to find a way to put the wraith into all copies of the game. Then we would release the game and everyone would get to experience what we did while playing it. He was certain it would be a massive success if we could achieve this - he went as far as to claim it might end up being one of the most successful indie horror titles of all time. 

I brought up the significant issue with his plan. There could only be a single copy of the haunted game. My friends could only experience the game like I did when they played it on my computer. Streaming or otherwise recording the game couldn’t effectively recapture the effect playing it had. 

He suggested running the game files through a special program to create duplicates of the wraith. Though it seemed like a dubious prospect to me, I agreed to transfer the file onto a USB drive to give to him. He was convinced he could pull it off and his excitement at the idea was contagious. 

For the next couple of months George dedicated himself to development of the game. The work he did during this time was impressive. In one livestream he toured us through a life sized sports stadium and a fully furnished shopping mall. 

He wanted the experience of the game to be unique for everyone who played it. For this, he had decided to make the world procedurally generated. It was an overly ambitious goal but George was adamant he could pull it off and he already had the code to prove it. 

The progress he’d made was great but it wasn’t what we cared about. We wanted to hear about what he’d done with the wraith.

George admitted he was struggling to control the thing. It was skipping through files in the game too fast for him to keep track of. He assured us he would get on top of the issue and fulfill his promise. We just needed to be patient. 

George was a binge worker. He was typically either procrastinating or feverishly working on something. We were used to seeing him worn out after staying up late completing an assignment the night before it was due. I bring this up to explain why we weren’t initially concerned when we noticed the way George looked during classes. 

We did get a bit worried when he started skipping classes and missed a pair of exams. That concern evolved into worry when Nick overheard he’d bailed out on a family reunion. 

We reached out to him. He admitted his insomnia had come back. He tried to play it all off like it wasn’t a big deal and promised us he intended to see a doctor. Two weeks later, George shared with us another milestone in the game's development. The stalker was a new idea George had added into the game. It would come out after a certain amount of time had elapsed in-game. 

The stalker was supposed to be a physical manifestation of the feeling of something hidden just behind every corner and lurking beyond the walls of fog that the wraith elicited.  

We were a little peeved he’d updated the game in such a major way without consulting with any of us. We might have argued about it, however George was the lead developer of the game and currently the only one working on it at the time. 

Over the course of the two hour livestream he wandered the empty landscapes of the game searching for the stalker and we sat watching him. 

For the first thirty minutes he traversed a metropolis full of stone-still figures staring out of windows from buildings rising unnaturally far into the sky. He wandered around a town square with an oversized, circular fountain where every building was obscured by a dense layer of stagnant mist. 

The creepy atmosphere of the game was offset by banter between us as we watched him play. Yet there was only so long we could fill the void of silence as George roamed restlessly around the empty world. He remained uncomfortably quiet, hardly responding to our attempts to start a conversation, and he became more irritable each time we tried to talk to him. 

*I think I see it,* George announced over the livestream suddenly. 

I didn’t see anything. Neither did any of the other viewers who were still tuned in. 

His avatar had stopped and was staring off toward the slope of a hill upon which a single lonely skyscraper rose into the sky. 

His next comment came after another minute of silence. 

*I keep walking toward this thing but it doesn't seem like I’m getting any closer.* 

*It has turned around, I think.* 

His avatar wasn’t moving at all. He hadn’t moved since he claimed to have seen the stalker. 

There was another pause. 

*You see it, don’t you?*

We all agreed that we could see nothing. 

*I see its face.*

*Bloody hell, there’s something wrong with it, It’s-*  

The livestream continued for a while with George’s avatar staring off into the depths of the grey gloom. We didn’t hear another word from him.

After a full day of no contact from George I went over to his place to check on him in person. 

George laughed his behavior off, telling me he’d felt a little sick and decided to take a break. 

He refused to acknowledge how strangely he’d been acting during the livestream. He couldn’t remember seeing the stalker at all and he couldn’t remember how the livestream ended. 

Following this incident George began to deteriorate more rapidly. His insomnia got worse. You could see signs of it whenever he bothered attending class. He started nodding off frequently. He was always staring off into space with a dull look in his eyes, hardly acknowledging the world going on around him.

George had started a blog a year prior as a game dev diary to keep the small community of fans the game had attracted up to date on its progress. By that time it had become the main way he communicated with the outside world.

\-

*I’m sorry for all the delays in releasing the alpha. Development has been complicated by bugs and some other personal issues going on in my life.* 

*-*

*-*

*A lot of you have been asking, who is the Stalker? I’ve been thinking about this a lot recently. Deliberating over whether it’s better to leave it a mystery for the player to imagine or if I should give a backstory to uncover as they explore. I would appreciate your input on this.* 

*-*

*-*

*I’m hoping to release an update to the demo to show off some of the new stuff I’ve patched in. I’m looking for playtesters.* 

*Tell me you hate the game if you want - I just want to hear some honest input from people.* 

*-*

*-*

*I had a dream last night. In the dream I was wandering around in circles inside a city. It soon dawned on me that I was stuck inside the game.* 

*The stalker was there. It took off its face as if it were some kind of mask. What I saw after that frightened me enough to run like hell away from it. I wish I could tell you what it was I saw but all I can recall is a haze.* 

*I kept running until I couldn't anymore. When I stopped and checked behind me the stalker was gone.* 

*Then somehow I was back where I began my journey. I started to walk again for whatever reason. As is the case many times in dreams I was unable to control my own actions.* 

*Later I found myself at the tall building where I first saw the stalker and the events of the dream repeated themselves. I was confronted with the entity again. It took off its face and I saw what lay beneath. And I ran in terror.* 

*This cycle repeated over and over. Each time the entity revealed itself as something horrifying, though once again, I can’t remember its appearance. I couldn’t tell you if it had a different face each time or the same one.* 

*The dream lasted an uncomfortably long time. It was longer than any other dream I’ve ever had. When I woke up from it I felt as exhausted as if I had spent the whole night awake.*   

*-*

*-*

*I have these dreams every night. They last so long and they seem too real. When I wake up from them I feel as if I haven’t slept at all.* 

*I find it increasingly difficult to focus during the day and I’ve become accustomed to feeling maddeningly tired all the time. I didn’t know it was possible to want to sleep so badly and yet find it so bloody hard to get any proper rest.* 

*The sleeping pills aren’t working anymore. I take them anyway. I’m very dependent on them and I don’t have the energy to deal with the side effects of quitting. At least they make me feel a little less crappy for a while.* 

*-*

Weeks passed before another update was made. I think there were a pair of deleted posts written during the period but I couldn’t recover them. 

Here is the last thing he ever posted:

*-*

*Hi everyone*

*I need to focus on my mental health for a while. I will be pausing work on game development for now.* 

*I’m sorry for all of you who expected a release soon. I can't say when an alpha is going to arrive - or if I’m ever going to pick up this game again, to be honest.* 

*For anyone still tuned in, this is goodbye. For now.* 

*-*

We’d had a talk with him and finally gotten George to understand how seriously he needed help. He’d been persuaded to speak to a new doctor about his sleep issues and he came back with a new prescription. He also acknowledged how obsessed he had become with the game and agreed to take a break from working on it. He was still in a bad state but he’d taken the first steps in getting his life back together. 

I made a mistake then, though I didn’t realize it at the time. I allowed George to keep the possessed copy of the game. As long as the wraith remained in his life, its grip on his mind would never loosen. Not understanding that truth cost George everything. 

A couple of days after our last exchange George was found dead in his apartment. 

It was a seizure, the doctors said. The seizure caused apnea, which was what caused his sudden death. 

The scene must have been traumatizing for his mother who discovered him in his apartment. 

When she’d found him he was lying on the floor. The room was dark except for the flickering light of his computer. It was locked on the game world. George was spread eagled, his face turned to the side and one of his arms was dislocated. 

It felt like so little time ago that I was hanging out at George’s place with a pile of pizzas and some drinks and we were laughing at some silly game he’d created over the weekend for a game jam. The George I remembered was a totally different person from the haggard and mottled skeleton of a person we saw at the funeral. 

The game was abandoned. After a couple months passed we began working on a new project together but without George there to guide and motivate us it lacked the passion and drive it needed to get anywhere. Soon enough we abandoned it too. 

As for the wraith, it sat untouched within an unidentified file on George's computer for a while. His home remained undisturbed for close to a year. 

George’s mother eventually decided to clean up the apartment. She asked us if there was anything of his we wanted to keep. After some deliberation, I agreed to be the one to go back there to retrieve his computer containing the possessed copy of the game. 

My friends and I replayed the game to make sure the wraith hadn’t moved again. Once we agreed that it was still inhabiting the game we deliberated on what to do with it. 

We decided we couldn’t dispose of the computer. The wraith would transfer itself to another conduit and with the new item it would prey on someone else - perhaps another one of us.

After some debate we agreed to have it sealed away instead. We hoped it might remain inactive if it was isolated from people as it had been before I moved into the house. 

Nick rented out a storage unit. We locked the hard drive of the computer in a safebox and we left it there. We hoped to never have to lay eyes on it again. 

For a couple of years our plan actually worked. Nothing could replace the piece of our lives the wraith had stolen but at least now we knew it wouldn’t hurt anyone else. 

Things were complicated when the storage space was robbed. Nothing was stolen from the unit we’d rented but the one next door was completely trashed. Nick elected to move the safebox and its contents to a new, more secure location. Just in case, he said. 

Somewhere along the journey moving it I believe the wraith abandoned the hard drive and attached itself to something in Nick’s car. From there, it followed him home and silently slipped into his life. We didn’t figure out this had happened until much later. 

Since graduating college Nick had become a successful voice actor. He found roles in some video games and a couple of minor tv shows. 

Nick was also an aspiring ventriloquist, something he picked up from his father. His father had been a semi popular ventriloquist during his time and Nick liked to talk about continuing his legacy. 

It should be noted Nick had never been great at ventriloquism. He was convinced he was good at it but he really wasn’t. He loved doing acts onstage but very few could sit through the performances and feel entertained the way he entertained himself. He had a very off brand kind of humor that only he seemed to understand and he didn’t take criticism of his acts very well. 

The fact was Nick was a great voice actor and he had the technique down perfectly for making the dummy appear as if it were talking. But he just couldn’t put together an interesting script and that ruined his performances. 

Everything changed when the wraith returned in its newest form a couple months later. Nick introduced his audiences to Tommy, the ventriloquist dummy he claimed to have discovered stashed away inside the depths of his basement. 

Nick played the role of a submissive character to the dummy, who subjected him to sharing with the audience embarrassing and controversial stories of their years spent together. 

It was a new kind of act and quite different from the material he relied on previously, and it worked out great. The new content was engaging and funny and it stood him out from his competitors. In a couple of weeks he had gone from being a local bar performer to a local sensation. 

I knew the first time I saw him perform with Tommy in person that something was wrong with the dummy. 

I wasn’t the only one who felt that way, either. My friends shared my suspicions. 

My fear was all but confirmed after we visited Nick in person after one show. When I looked into the dummy’s dead, white eyes I sensed something staring back at me. I felt the same way I did when I played our unfinished game and the way I felt being around the possessed portraits.

Nick patiently explained that we were silly to be worried about him. The dummy wasn’t possessed or haunted, he said with a chuckle. He’d convinced himself everything that happened with George was a result of a mental health crisis and the wraith never really existed in the first place. 

The more we pushed him, the more irritable he became. He laughed at us. He called us crazy and claimed we were jealous of his success. He told us we were all pathetic and then threatened to stop speaking to us if we didn’t drop the issue. 

We were still arguing with one another about how to get him to see sense when an unexpected opportunity presented itself. A few weeks later, Nick asked me to review a new act he was working on. I was the only one on good terms with him at the time but I managed to convince Nick to allow his friends to come over so they could apologize to him in person for the previous fight. 

The three of us had agreed to try something more radical. When we came over to visit, Matthew and Hayden. Once they’d both convinced Nick of their remorse we asked to see his newest act and he settled in to show it to us. The moment he got the dummy out, we sprung into action. 

His reaction was comical. He refused to give up on his act as we tried to snatch Tommy out of his hands. The dummy begged him for help as we tried to wrestle it away from him. It started laughing as he chased us through the house, its jaw swinging up and down as Nick ran after us. Nick was making the hysterical laughing sound and yet simultaneously wore a completely horrified expression on his face. 

Once we’d made our escape we smashed it into pieces with a hammer and threw the remains into the trash. 

The very next day Nick was back on stage with the same dummy, which didn’t have a scratch on it, acting like nothing had happened. He refused to speak to any of us again after that. 

We returned to researching the origins of the entity hoping to find a way to get rid of the source of our problems. I won’t get into this much because it was a futile exercise. When we asked for help online the responses we got ranged from disbelieving to making fun of us. We talked to two people who claimed they could help us but they both turned out to be trolls. That was about the extent of it. 

The wraith was manipulating Nick, I suspected. It gave him a taste of fame and success like he’d never experienced before and got him drunk on it. He quickly became dependent on the dummy since he couldn’t perform without it. 

Over time, Nick’s performances became increasingly disturbing and provocative. I continued to see them sporadically after our fallout, still convinced I could somehow get through to him. They were difficult to sit through. 

He knew certain things about the audience, who he frequently interacted with. The interactions he shared with people left many uncomfortable or offended. Others were entertained by his uncanny abilities and provocative personality. I saw people who were in hysterics after watching his performances and talked to others who were religious, fanatic fans of his. 

As its grip over his mind tightened, Nick began to talk to the dummy outside of shows. This was first spotted by his family but it became obvious to everyone else around him in time. He had begun taking it with him wherever he went. Near the end his brother claimed he never saw Nick without Tommy latched onto him. It had become his permanent companion. A part of him. 

This behavior didn’t do wonders for his reputation but by then he had accumulated a loyal band of followers who didn’t care how eccentric and messed up he acted. The wraith gave him the success he'd dreamed of since he was a child but it did so at an unspeakable price. 

As for what happened to Nick, we never figured out a way to help him. The last place he was ever seen was somewhere strange called the Grand Circus of Mysteries. He worked there for a while as one of the star performers before inexplicably disappearing off the face of the earth following a particularly disturbed act. The dummy left with him, but I had no doubt the thing living inside it was still lurking out there somewhere. 

I lost track of the entity for a while after it had finished with Nick. I assumed it had gone on to haunt somebody else's life. Personally I wanted nothing more to do with it. 

My remaining moved out of town and I soon lost contact with them. I think we all felt responsible for failing Nick and we saw each other as reminders of this failure. It was better for all of us if we put the past behind us and moved on with our separate lives. 

I was watching the news one day some years later. The anchor began discussing a sinkhole which had appeared in a stretch of desolate plains outside of my hometown. They described it as a black hole in the ground which sucked in all the light from around it. 

I visited the place in person a couple days later. By then half the people in town had gone over to take a look. 

I approached close enough to lean over and look down into the depths of the cave. When I gazed into the abyss I felt something deep within staring back up at me. 

There I fell into a kind of daze. I felt as if I were falling into the blackness. The world around me became unreal and distant. 

My wife who’d gone out there with me claimed I stood over the hole for over a minute, swaying slightly as I stared down into it. 

It was her who broke me out of my trance. She had to slap me several times before I returned to my senses. By then, I was leaning over far enough that she swore I was about to fall in. 

I’ve been keeping track of the sinkhole since I visited it. I heard a group of kids dared someone to venture inside shortly after I went there. Jeff, I believe his name was. 

He reappeared a couple of days later with no recollection of having gone missing. 

I saw an older version of this boy in the news the other day, nearly ten years later. After I heard about what he did I figured it was time for me to finally get this story out there. 

I’m guessing the wraith has moved on from him by now. Perhaps it returned to the sinkhole, or maybe it has attached itself to a new conduit. Wherever it is, I don’t doubt it is searching for another victim.

He stopped leaving the place completely. After a month of being pent up inside he died of starvation.’ 

‘He was a hoarder. A serious one. It took weeks to get the home cleaned up, and even then there’s still some junk in the basement the cleaners left there. I’d be curious to have a look and see if there’s anything valuable.’ He snorted. ‘I doubt it though.’ 

I sorted through what remained of the clutter and determined most of it to be worthless. There were shelves full of dusty tools and stacks of used furniture. Shoved up against the wall was a large mattress with dirty, stained sheets and old clothes piled on top of it. 

There was one thing I uncovered which did catch my attention. In the far back corner of the basement something was hidden underneath a white sheet: a chest, turned back to face the wall. Within the chest I discovered a diary and a stack of paintings.. 

I skimmed through the diary first. Below I’ve copied out some of the stranger entries as I read them:

\-

*I had one of the oddest experiences of my life today.* 

*It started with a dream. From what I could recall I was fleeing from something. I don’t remember what it looked like. I know it was huge - on a cosmic scale. And it wasn’t supposed to exist. I’m not sure if that makes sense but describing the thing at all is difficult for me.* 

*I woke up from the dream with my head throbbing and sweat covering my body. My throat was dry and raw. My ears were ringing. Something felt wrong.* 

*When I went outside the following morning what I saw was bizarre. It looked like a bolt of lightning had struck the ground at the edge of the stretch of hayfields extending past my backyard. The immediate section of corn was blackened and withered, the corn further out a sickly brown color.* 

*In the center of the circle of scorched earth sat a hand sized stone totem. Four uncanny faces decorated each of its sides. They appeared almost but not quite human. Two were screaming, the other two bore grins which extended unnaturally wide. The piece of stone was stained on one side with a blotch of reddish brown.* 

*-*

The previous homeowner took the totem back to his house and put it in the basement. The next couple of entries deliberated over various other aspects of his life. I was intrigued enough to keep skimming through the diary and my curiosity was soon rewarded. 

\-

*Something happened to one of my paintings. I’m writing this down to help me understand it.* 

*I have owned the painting for years. It has been here since before my parents moved in. It’s the type of thing you live with for such a long time you never really notice it. Yet now every time I sit in the room with it I swear I can feel the painting watching me.* 

*-*

He went on to describe the painting - an old man sitting on a table with a walking stick in one hand, the other holding a pair of spectacles up to his eyes. When he had examined it closer, Tom noticed something about the painting had changed. 

\-

*The man looks different. He looks scared. And there is a long, tall shadow in the shadows behind him, only barely visible, but it's definitely there.* 

*After a couple days I took it off the wall and put it away in the basement. That was when I noticed the idol had fallen off the shelf it had been sitting on. It has shattered into several pieces.* 

*The idol no longer gave off the sense of malice it did when I found it. But that’s not to say the feeling has gone - it hasn’t.* 

*-*

*-*

*I went back down to the basement. I checked on both the remains of the idol and the watercolor painting. I previously described my discomfort being around the portrait of the old man but that instinct is gone now. The painting itself appears normal again. Just an old man staring at the viewer with an expression suggesting him to be deep in thought.* 

*Upstairs I have a couple of other portraits hanging up around my house. One is of a little waterfall in a forest. Now out of the corner of my eye I swear I can see something staring out at me from in between two trees within the painting.* 

*I thought it had to be my imagination but when I succumbed to paranoia and took a closer look I realized it wasn’t. When I peered close enough I caught the shadow of something tall in the trees, hunched over to the side at an odd and unnatural angle.* 

\-

\-

*More of the portraits in my house have been changed. These changes are both subtle and unnerving. What is stranger is that when one painting changes, the others change back. The shadow of the thing inside the waterfall painting has disappeared.* 

*I want to know if what is going on here can be explained rationally. And if it can’t, I want to understand what the hell this thing is haunting me.* 

*-*

*-*

*I’ve thought about it and I believe getting rid of the remains would be wisest. I can’t emphasize enough how uncomfortable it is to share a house with it - the thing possessing my paintings, which must be somehow connected to the fetish.* 

*I hate being around the paintings once they’ve changed. They’re not so bad after they’ve changed back, but whichever painting possesses the visual anomalies feels alive. Not just alive, but hostile. I honestly feel like the thing inside the paintings despises me.* 

*I’m not overly superstitious but I’d be an idiot to deny there was something evil about the idol I discovered out there.* 

*-*

*-*

*Getting rid of the idol didn’t work. Getting rid of all of the paintings I’ve spotted changes in didn’t work. It keeps switching between other portraits all around the house.* 

*The most recent one it took possession of is a landscape portrait of a small, old fashioned neighborhood from the 1930s. Something is staring out at me through one window, no more than a hazy blur in the greyness of the glass. I took it down and put it away with the other ones.* 

*-*

The following entries described how it moved from one image to another. Tom subsequently developed a phobia of being around portraits and avoided them religiously, going as far as to lock every painting he owned away in his basement. 

His entries became less and less coherent. He discussed how his world was falling apart. The account he wrote painted a sad picture of a depressed and lonely man who needed help but didn’t know how or where to get it.   

I could hardly make sense of the last couple entries. They read like the ramblings of a madman. I wasn’t surprised since Gilbert told me he had been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses in the years leading up to his death.  

Tom scoured his house repeatedly looking for paintings. He claimed to discover different pictures hanging off of his walls every couple of weeks. It became a daily ritual to check his house to make sure no new ones had appeared. He was convinced something awful would happen if the wraith (as he had begun calling it) was left outside of his basement for too long. 

This was where the readable part of the journal ended. The remaining entries were impossible to make sense of. 

I took the journal upstairs and sorted through the paintings. They were the same ones the author described. 

The one at the bottom of the pile was a depiction of a procession of gaunt soldiers from what looked to be WW2, trudging over the remains of a weathered battleground. The soldier’s eyes were fearful and haunted, their faces stark white. 

This photo scared me in an inexplicable way. The longer I looked at it the more mad and deranged the faces of the soldiers appeared. The sensation I felt while around it mirrored the one the author had described - a steadily growing sense of uneasiness which made it difficult to gaze upon the painting for too long. 

One of the first things I did with the portrait was take a photo of it on my phone. Tom had done the same thing a couple of times previously and made a dubious claim. According to him, the effects the portrait had on him didn’t extend to photos of it, no matter how many he took. 

He was right. The portrait looked distinctly different on camera. The faces of the soldiers appeared more grim rather than haunted and the one furthest to the back of the procession wasn’t grinning in a deranged way the way he was in the original picture. 

I took a couple more photographs, still not quite able to believe it, but they all showed the same thing. 

At a housewarming party I showed the war portrait to some friends. They each shared my discomfort when they looked at it. Some of them didn’t get the feeling of dread I described immediately but one by one they each succumbed to it. 

When I showed them the photos they confirmed the differences I noticed were real. They complimented me on my photo editing skills and I had to explain to them that I didn’t do any of this. When I proved the fact by taking another photograph one of my friends came up with an interesting theory. He suggested a special kind of paint could have been used to make the painting appear different in the light of the camera as a picture was being taken. 

Keen to get to the bottom of the mystery, I began testing some of the other claims made by Tom in his diary. I placed the WW2 portrait next to a collection of creepy photos I’d found online and printed out.

The first time it happened was with a photo of a pale, angular face leering out of a dark background. I couldn’t say precisely when it occurred but the wraith took possession of the photo. What had once been a piece of paper with a generic scary image printed on it was now a dark, almost oppressive presence lying on my desk beside me. 

Something else happened, too. The WW2 portrait changed subtly. The soldiers' faces now looked like they did in the photos I took of the portrait. It worked just as Tom had described in his journal. 

Whenever I wasn’t looking directly at one of the photos I could swear the face in it had turned around to stare at me . I frequently looked to check this wasn’t the case but this did little to curb my anxiety.

The effect of the photos seemed to be cumulative over time, the longer the wraith inhabited one photograph. It began as a persistent and intrusive feeling of uneasiness. The longer I spent around the photographs the more they troubled me. The white, angular face began showing up in the corner of my eye. I began to understand why Tom spoke of the portraits the way he did and why he hid so many of them away in the basement. 

If I shared the same room as the wraith I couldn’t bring myself to remain turned away from it for too long - or to look at it for too long, either. And I wasn’t the only one who felt that way. My friends all shared the same sentiment. Once we played a game to see who could look at one of the possessed photos for the longest. The best of us lasted nine minutes before shuddering, turning away and leaving the room. 

There were things the wraith could do which Tom never learned about. But I did. All of what I’d seen so far was only the beginning of what the wraith was capable of. 

One rainy day when I was stuck on a class assignment I elected to take a break and went out to get a coffee. When I came back I noticed something looking back at me from my computer screen which hadn’t been there before. 

It didn’t take me long to pick out the subtle differences in the photo on my screen and deduce what had happened. The wraith had transferred itself onto my computer. What I was looking at was a digital copy of the same leering face I showed you earlier. 

No copy I made of the image file replicated the cognitive effects of the possessed image or the visual differences the wraith had made to it. Modifying the image itself didn’t do anything at first. When I changed it too much the wraith abandoned the image and reattached itself to another one in the same folder. 

I put another image into a parent directory, deleted the possessed one and waited for a response. I didn’t have to wait long. The wraith did what I’d predicted it would do, moving to the image in the other directory. 

A couple of days later I managed to get it inside of a gif. The image depicted a girl standing and staring at her reflection. The animated loop was of the reflection leaning forward and beginning to push its face into the other side of the mirror. The wraith added an extra second to the end of the gif showing the reflection melting through the glass on the girl’s side of the mirror while reaching out for her. This difference was disturbing enough on its own, but I could have sworn the gif was changing a little more each time it played on my screen. 

From time to time the gif would pop up on screen unprompted, stuck in its ceaseless repetition. I began to feel a vague sense of dread while using my computer as I feared another occurrence of the wraith flashing up on my screen. It was a stupid thing to be scared of but I struggled to shake the feeling off. 

Recently I’d watched a slasher flick and I decided to see if the wraith would interact with it. 

Like with the other media there were tangible differences in the possessed version of the film. The murder scenes were more graphic and lasted longer. The movie concluded with a ten second shot of the murderer staring into the camera expressionlessly with no music or noise. 

Upon watching the movie for a second time several more scenes played out where various characters stopped, fell silent, and stared into the screen as the murderer had done. 

The movie mutated further each time I watched it. Scenes became glitched and the subtitles turned into an incomprehensible jumble of characters from a language I couldn’t identify.  

After showing the movie to my friends, they were as unable as I was to explain what they saw. They had seen enough to be convinced the wraith was real, even if I wasn’t so sure of the fact myself. However, none of us were scared by the idea - we were fascinated. 

We were debating what it meant when one of them brought up an intriguing suggestion. 

This little group of ours was in the middle of working on a horror game. It was a passion project the five of us - George, me, Nick, Hayden and Matthew - had envisioned during our first year together at college.  

‘The wraith can inhabit all kinds of media,’ George said, leaning in. ‘What if it could inhabit a video game?’

At his urging, I moved the possessed movie file into the game folder on my computer. When this didn’t have an effect, I deleted the file the wraith had possessed. It turned up in an image file again - this time, a texture within the game.

The game we were working on was an exploration of a large, liminal landscape. There was little story or background - just wandering through an eerie world with an atmosphere inspired by titles ranging from the old Silent Hill games to ActiveWorlds. 

Even though little in the game had been tangibly changed, playing it was a totally different experience. There was an unshakable sense something was hidden in the game with us. Something which wasn’t supposed to be there. 

George in particular was blown away by what the game had become. He got it into his head that we had to find a way to put the wraith into all copies of the game. Then we would release the game and everyone would get to experience what we did while playing it. He was certain it would be a massive success if we could achieve this - he went as far as to claim it might end up being one of the most successful indie horror titles of all time. 

I brought up the significant issue with his plan. There could only be a single copy of the haunted game. My friends could only experience the game like I did when they played it on my computer. Streaming or otherwise recording the game couldn’t effectively recapture the effect playing it had. 

He suggested running the game files through a special program to create duplicates of the wraith. Though it seemed like a dubious prospect to me, I agreed to transfer the file onto a USB drive to give to him. He was convinced he could pull it off and his excitement at the idea was contagious. 

For the next couple of months George dedicated himself to development of the game. The work he did during this time was impressive. In one livestream he toured us through a life sized sports stadium and a fully furnished shopping mall. 

He wanted the experience of the game to be unique for everyone who played it. For this, he had decided to make the world procedurally generated. It was an overly ambitious goal but George was adamant he could pull it off and he already had the code to prove it. 

The progress he’d made was great but it wasn’t what we cared about. We wanted to hear about what he’d done with the wraith.

George admitted he was struggling to control the thing. It was skipping through files in the game too fast for him to keep track of. He assured us he would get on top of the issue and fulfill his promise. We just needed to be patient. 

George was a binge worker. He was typically either procrastinating or feverishly working on something. We were used to seeing him worn out after staying up late completing an assignment the night before it was due. I bring this up to explain why we weren’t initially concerned when we noticed the way George looked during classes. 

We did get a bit worried when he started skipping classes and missed a pair of exams. That concern evolved into worry when Nick overheard he’d bailed out on a family reunion. 

We reached out to him. He admitted his insomnia had come back. He tried to play it all off like it wasn’t a big deal and promised us he intended to see a doctor. Two weeks later, George shared with us another milestone in the game's development. The stalker was a new idea George had added into the game. It would come out after a certain amount of time had elapsed in-game. 

The stalker was supposed to be a physical manifestation of the feeling of something hidden just behind every corner and lurking beyond the walls of fog that the wraith elicited.  

We were a little peeved he’d updated the game in such a major way without consulting with any of us. We might have argued about it, however George was the lead developer of the game and currently the only one working on it at the time. 

Over the course of the two hour livestream he wandered the empty landscapes of the game searching for the stalker and we sat watching him. 

For the first thirty minutes he traversed a metropolis full of stone-still figures staring out of windows from buildings rising unnaturally far into the sky. He wandered around a town square with an oversized, circular fountain where every building was obscured by a dense layer of stagnant mist. 

The creepy atmosphere of the game was offset by banter between us as we watched him play. Yet there was only so long we could fill the void of silence as George roamed restlessly around the empty world. He remained uncomfortably quiet, hardly responding to our attempts to start a conversation, and he became more irritable each time we tried to talk to him. 

*I think I see it,* George announced over the livestream suddenly. 

I didn’t see anything. Neither did any of the other viewers who were still tuned in. 

His avatar had stopped and was staring off toward the slope of a hill upon which a single lonely skyscraper rose into the sky. 

His next comment came after another minute of silence. 

*I keep walking toward this thing but it doesn't seem like I’m getting any closer.* 

*It has turned around, I think.* 

His avatar wasn’t moving at all. He hadn’t moved since he claimed to have seen the stalker. 

There was another pause. 

*You see it, don’t you?*

We all agreed that we could see nothing. 

*I see its face.*

*Bloody hell, there’s something wrong with it, It’s-*  

The livestream continued for a while with George’s avatar staring off into the depths of the grey gloom. We didn’t hear another word from him.

After a full day of no contact from George I went over to his place to check on him in person. 

George laughed his behavior off, telling me he’d felt a little sick and decided to take a break. 

He refused to acknowledge how strangely he’d been acting during the livestream. He couldn’t remember seeing the stalker at all and he couldn’t remember how the livestream ended. 

Following this incident George began to deteriorate more rapidly. His insomnia got worse. You could see signs of it whenever he bothered attending class. He started nodding off frequently. He was always staring off into space with a dull look in his eyes, hardly acknowledging the world going on around him.

George had started a blog a year prior as a game dev diary to keep the small community of fans the game had attracted up to date on its progress. By that time it had become the main way he communicated with the outside world.

\-

*I’m sorry for all the delays in releasing the alpha. Development has been complicated by bugs and some other personal issues going on in my life.* 

*-*

*-*

*A lot of you have been asking, who is the Stalker? I’ve been thinking about this a lot recently. Deliberating over whether it’s better to leave it a mystery for the player to imagine or if I should give a backstory to uncover as they explore. I would appreciate your input on this.* 

*-*

*-*

*I’m hoping to release an update to the demo to show off some of the new stuff I’ve patched in. I’m looking for playtesters.* 

*Tell me you hate the game if you want - I just want to hear some honest input from people.* 

*-*

*-*

*I had a dream last night. In the dream I was wandering around in circles inside a city. It soon dawned on me that I was stuck inside the game.* 

*The stalker was there. It took off its face as if it were some kind of mask. What I saw after that frightened me enough to run like hell away from it. I wish I could tell you what it was I saw but all I can recall is a haze.* 

*I kept running until I couldn't anymore. When I stopped and checked behind me the stalker was gone.* 

*Then somehow I was back where I began my journey. I started to walk again for whatever reason. As is the case many times in dreams I was unable to control my own actions.* 

*Later I found myself at the tall building where I first saw the stalker and the events of the dream repeated themselves. I was confronted with the entity again. It took off its face and I saw what lay beneath. And I ran in terror.* 

*This cycle repeated over and over. Each time the entity revealed itself as something horrifying, though once again, I can’t remember its appearance. I couldn’t tell you if it had a different face each time or the same one.* 

*The dream lasted an uncomfortably long time. It was longer than any other dream I’ve ever had. When I woke up from it I felt as exhausted as if I had spent the whole night awake.*   

*-*

*-*

*I have these dreams every night. They last so long and they seem too real. When I wake up from them I feel as if I haven’t slept at all.* 

*I find it increasingly difficult to focus during the day and I’ve become accustomed to feeling maddeningly tired all the time. I didn’t know it was possible to want to sleep so badly and yet find it so bloody hard to get any proper rest.* 

*The sleeping pills aren’t working anymore. I take them anyway. I’m very dependent on them and I don’t have the energy to deal with the side effects of quitting. At least they make me feel a little less crappy for a while.* 

*-*

Weeks passed before another update was made. I think there were a pair of deleted posts written during the period but I couldn’t recover them. 

Here is the last thing he ever posted:

*-*

*Hi everyone*

*I need to focus on my mental health for a while. I will be pausing work on game development for now.* 

*I’m sorry for all of you who expected a release soon. I can't say when an alpha is going to arrive - or if I’m ever going to pick up this game again, to be honest.* 

*For anyone still tuned in, this is goodbye. For now.* 

*-*

We’d had a talk with him and finally gotten George to understand how seriously he needed help. He’d been persuaded to speak to a new doctor about his sleep issues and he came back with a new prescription. He also acknowledged how obsessed he had become with the game and agreed to take a break from working on it. He was still in a bad state but he’d taken the first steps in getting his life back together. 

I made a mistake then, though I didn’t realize it at the time. I allowed George to keep the possessed copy of the game. As long as the wraith remained in his life, its grip on his mind would never loosen. Not understanding that truth cost George everything. 

A couple of days after our last exchange George was found dead in his apartment. 

It was a seizure, the doctors said. The seizure caused apnea, which was what caused his sudden death. 

The scene must have been traumatizing for his mother who discovered him in his apartment. 

When she’d found him he was lying on the floor. The room was dark except for the flickering light of his computer. It was locked on the game world. George was spread eagled, his face turned to the side and one of his arms was dislocated. 

It felt like so little time ago that I was hanging out at George’s place with a pile of pizzas and some drinks and we were laughing at some silly game he’d created over the weekend for a game jam. The George I remembered was a totally different person from the haggard and mottled skeleton of a person we saw at the funeral. 

The game was abandoned. After a couple months passed we began working on a new project together but without George there to guide and motivate us it lacked the passion and drive it needed to get anywhere. Soon enough we abandoned it too. 

As for the wraith, it sat untouched within an unidentified file on George's computer for a while. His home remained undisturbed for close to a year. 

George’s mother eventually decided to clean up the apartment. She asked us if there was anything of his we wanted to keep. After some deliberation, I agreed to be the one to go back there to retrieve his computer containing the possessed copy of the game. 

My friends and I replayed the game to make sure the wraith hadn’t moved again. Once we agreed that it was still inhabiting the game we deliberated on what to do with it. 

We decided we couldn’t dispose of the computer. The wraith would transfer itself to another conduit and with the new item it would prey on someone else - perhaps another one of us.

After some debate we agreed to have it sealed away instead. We hoped it might remain inactive if it was isolated from people as it had been before I moved into the house. 

Nick rented out a storage unit. We locked the hard drive of the computer in a safebox and we left it there. We hoped to never have to lay eyes on it again. 

For a couple of years our plan actually worked. Nothing could replace the piece of our lives the wraith had stolen but at least now we knew it wouldn’t hurt anyone else. 

Things were complicated when the storage space was robbed. Nothing was stolen from the unit we’d rented but the one next door was completely trashed. Nick elected to move the safebox and its contents to a new, more secure location. Just in case, he said. 

Somewhere along the journey moving it I believe the wraith abandoned the hard drive and attached itself to something in Nick’s car. From there, it followed him home and silently slipped into his life. We didn’t figure out this had happened until much later. 

Since graduating college Nick had become a successful voice actor. He found roles in some video games and a couple of minor tv shows. 

Nick was also an aspiring ventriloquist, something he picked up from his father. His father had been a semi popular ventriloquist during his time and Nick liked to talk about continuing his legacy. 

It should be noted Nick had never been great at ventriloquism. He was convinced he was good at it but he really wasn’t. He loved doing acts onstage but very few could sit through the performances and feel entertained the way he entertained himself. He had a very off brand kind of humor that only he seemed to understand and he didn’t take criticism of his acts very well. 

The fact was Nick was a great voice actor and he had the technique down perfectly for making the dummy appear as if it were talking. But he just couldn’t put together an interesting script and that ruined his performances. 

Everything changed when the wraith returned in its newest form a couple months later. Nick introduced his audiences to Tommy, the ventriloquist dummy he claimed to have discovered stashed away inside the depths of his basement. 

Nick played the role of a submissive character to the dummy, who subjected him to sharing with the audience embarrassing and controversial stories of their years spent together. 

It was a new kind of act and quite different from the material he relied on previously, and it worked out great. The new content was engaging and funny and it stood him out from his competitors. In a couple of weeks he had gone from being a local bar performer to a local sensation. 

I knew the first time I saw him perform with Tommy in person that something was wrong with the dummy. 

I wasn’t the only one who felt that way, either. My friends shared my suspicions. 

My fear was all but confirmed after we visited Nick in person after one show. When I looked into the dummy’s dead, white eyes I sensed something staring back at me. I felt the same way I did when I played our unfinished game and the way I felt being around the possessed portraits.

Nick patiently explained that we were silly to be worried about him. The dummy wasn’t possessed or haunted, he said with a chuckle. He’d convinced himself everything that happened with George was a result of a mental health crisis and the wraith never really existed in the first place. 

The more we pushed him, the more irritable he became. He laughed at us. He called us crazy and claimed we were jealous of his success. He told us we were all pathetic and then threatened to stop speaking to us if we didn’t drop the issue. 

We were still arguing with one another about how to get him to see sense when an unexpected opportunity presented itself. A few weeks later, Nick asked me to review a new act he was working on. I was the only one on good terms with him at the time but I managed to convince Nick to allow his friends to come over so they could apologize to him in person for the previous fight. 

The three of us had agreed to try something more radical. When we came over to visit, Matthew and Hayden. Once they’d both convinced Nick of their remorse we asked to see his newest act and he settled in to show it to us. The moment he got the dummy out, we sprung into action. 

His reaction was comical. He refused to give up on his act as we tried to snatch Tommy out of his hands. The dummy begged him for help as we tried to wrestle it away from him. It started laughing as he chased us through the house, its jaw swinging up and down as Nick ran after us. Nick was making the hysterical laughing sound and yet simultaneously wore a completely horrified expression on his face. 

Once we’d made our escape we smashed it into pieces with a hammer and threw the remains into the trash. 

The very next day Nick was back on stage with the same dummy, which didn’t have a scratch on it, acting like nothing had happened. He refused to speak to any of us again after that. 

We returned to researching the origins of the entity hoping to find a way to get rid of the source of our problems. I won’t get into this much because it was a futile exercise. When we asked for help online the responses we got ranged from disbelieving to making fun of us. We talked to two people who claimed they could help us but they both turned out to be trolls. That was about the extent of it. 

The wraith was manipulating Nick, I suspected. It gave him a taste of fame and success like he’d never experienced before and got him drunk on it. He quickly became dependent on the dummy since he couldn’t perform without it. 

Over time, Nick’s performances became increasingly disturbing and provocative. I continued to see them sporadically after our fallout, still convinced I could somehow get through to him. They were difficult to sit through. 

He knew certain things about the audience, who he frequently interacted with. The interactions he shared with people left many uncomfortable or offended. Others were entertained by his uncanny abilities and provocative personality. I saw people who were in hysterics after watching his performances and talked to others who were religious, fanatic fans of his. 

As its grip over his mind tightened, Nick began to talk to the dummy outside of shows. This was first spotted by his family but it became obvious to everyone else around him in time. He had begun taking it with him wherever he went. Near the end his brother claimed he never saw Nick without Tommy latched onto him. It had become his permanent companion. A part of him. 

This behavior didn’t do wonders for his reputation but by then he had accumulated a loyal band of followers who didn’t care how eccentric and messed up he acted. The wraith gave him the success he'd dreamed of since he was a child but it did so at an unspeakable price. 

As for what happened to Nick, we never figured out a way to help him. The last place he was ever seen was somewhere strange called the Grand Circus of Mysteries. He worked there for a while as one of the star performers before inexplicably disappearing off the face of the earth following a particularly disturbed act. The dummy left with him, but I had no doubt the thing living inside it was still lurking out there somewhere. 

I lost track of the entity for a while after it had finished with Nick. I assumed it had gone on to haunt somebody else's life. Personally I wanted nothing more to do with it. 

My remaining moved out of town and I soon lost contact with them. I think we all felt responsible for failing Nick and we saw each other as reminders of this failure. It was better for all of us if we put the past behind us and moved on with our separate lives. 

I was watching the news one day some years later. The anchor began discussing a sinkhole which had appeared in a stretch of desolate plains outside of my hometown. They described it as a black hole in the ground which sucked in all the light from around it. 

I visited the place in person a couple days later. By then half the people in town had gone over to take a look. 

I approached close enough to lean over and look down into the depths of the cave. When I gazed into the abyss I felt something deep within staring back up at me. 

There I fell into a kind of daze. I felt as if I were falling into the blackness. The world around me became unreal and distant. 

My wife who’d gone out there with me claimed I stood over the hole for over a minute, swaying slightly as I stared down into it. 

It was her who broke me out of my trance. She had to slap me several times before I returned to my senses. By then, I was leaning over far enough that she swore I was about to fall in. 

I’ve been keeping track of the sinkhole since I visited it. I heard a group of kids dared someone to venture inside shortly after I went there. Jeff, I believe his name was. 

He reappeared a couple of days later with no recollection of having gone missing. 

I saw an older version of this boy in the news the other day, nearly ten years later. After I heard about what he did I figured it was time for me to finally get this story out there. 

I’m guessing the wraith has moved on from him by now. Perhaps it returned to the sinkhole, or maybe it has attached itself to a new conduit. Wherever it is, I don’t doubt it is searching for another victim. 

Stay safe out there.",1,1740130812.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1iun5k2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iun5k2,I tried a 100% specialty Robusta for the first time,"It’s not something I’m used to, I’m heavily biased towards fruit-forward beans, and all I can say is that I’m positively surprised. It tastes like almonds, is sweet, and not at all bitter. It’s smooth and rich, very comforting, even does have a faint hint of acidity. I kept the ratio short: 37g out with a 19g dose in 27 seconds, ground on a Philos with I200D burrs, which in my opinion aren’t the best burrs for these beans, but still produced delicious cup. My wife brought this bag from Munich, she bought it right after realizing what she’s looking at.

I'll be working in Peterborough NH. I don't want to live around that area because I'm assuming it will be quiet and difficult to meet people since it is so rural. It would be nice to live near a big city like Boston, so that it is easier to meet people -area with restaurants, bars, live music etc. However, with the distance from Boston it is unfeasible to live there and I do like a quieter place to live, with a town-like vibe. I visited Lexington MA and Winchester MA and I really  liked them - walkable, places to eat/get a coffee, small shops, commutable to work and Boston. I would go for these but it can be hard to find an apartment I think? (also on that, what are good website to look for rental properties)? I visited Nashua, which I wasn't too fond of to be honest, I didn't feel safe. I'm just wondering your guys' take on where would be good for me to rent in, at least initially. Benefit of living in NH is no income tax, but what I've seen of NH so far it seems like the access to cities/lively towns and suburbs is a lot less than you can get north of Boston. Any help would be much appreciated. Most I could be spending on rent would be about 2300-2500 per month (considering the cost of gas I'd have too if I lived 1hr+ from work). Any insight/advice is much appreciated. Thank you.",1,1740130777.0,u_Minimum_Goat_3191,0,1.0,False
1iun4oz,https://www.reddit.com/r/clancypasta/comments/1iun4oz/something_sinister_lived_within_my_paintings/,Something Sinister Lived Within My Paintings,"‘Tom went mad,’ Gilbert said. ‘Schizophrenia or something, I think. He stopped leaving the place completely. After a month of being pent up inside he died of starvation.’ 

‘He was a hoarder. A serious one. It took weeks to get the home cleaned up, and even then there’s still some junk in the basement the cleaners left there. I’d be curious to have a look and see if there’s anything valuable.’ He snorted. ‘I doubt it though.’ 

I sorted through what remained of the clutter and determined most of it to be worthless. There were shelves full of dusty tools and stacks of used furniture. Shoved up against the wall was a large mattress with dirty, stained sheets and old clothes piled on top of it. 

There was one thing I uncovered which did catch my attention. In the far back corner of the basement something was hidden underneath a white sheet: a chest, turned back to face the wall. Within the chest I discovered a diary and a stack of paintings.. 

I skimmed through the diary first. Below I’ve copied out some of the stranger entries as I read them:

\-

*I had one of the oddest experiences of my life today.* 

*It started with a dream. From what I could recall I was fleeing from something. I don’t remember what it looked like. I know it was huge - on a cosmic scale. And it wasn’t supposed to exist. I’m not sure if that makes sense but describing the thing at all is difficult for me.* 

*I woke up from the dream with my head throbbing and sweat covering my body. My throat was dry and raw. My ears were ringing. Something felt wrong.* 

*When I went outside the following morning what I saw was bizarre. It looked like a bolt of lightning had struck the ground at the edge of the stretch of hayfields extending past my backyard. The immediate section of corn was blackened and withered, the corn further out a sickly brown color.* 

*In the center of the circle of scorched earth sat a hand sized stone totem. Four uncanny faces decorated each of its sides. They appeared almost but not quite human. Two were screaming, the other two bore grins which extended unnaturally wide. The piece of stone was stained on one side with a blotch of reddish brown.* 

*-*

The previous homeowner took the totem back to his house and put it in the basement. The next couple of entries deliberated over various other aspects of his life. I was intrigued enough to keep skimming through the diary and my curiosity was soon rewarded. 

\-

*Something happened to one of my paintings. I’m writing this down to help me understand it.* 

*I have owned the painting for years. It has been here since before my parents moved in. It’s the type of thing you live with for such a long time you never really notice it. Yet now every time I sit in the room with it I swear I can feel the painting watching me.* 

*-*

He went on to describe the painting - an old man sitting on a table with a walking stick in one hand, the other holding a pair of spectacles up to his eyes. When he had examined it closer, Tom noticed something about the painting had changed. 

\-

*The man looks different. He looks scared. And there is a long, tall shadow in the shadows behind him, only barely visible, but it's definitely there.* 

*After a couple days I took it off the wall and put it away in the basement. That was when I noticed the idol had fallen off the shelf it had been sitting on. It has shattered into several pieces.* 

*The idol no longer gave off the sense of malice it did when I found it. But that’s not to say the feeling has gone - it hasn’t.* 

*-*

*-*

*I went back down to the basement. I checked on both the remains of the idol and the watercolor painting. I previously described my discomfort being around the portrait of the old man but that instinct is gone now. The painting itself appears normal again. Just an old man staring at the viewer with an expression suggesting him to be deep in thought.* 

*Upstairs I have a couple of other portraits hanging up around my house. One is of a little waterfall in a forest. Now out of the corner of my eye I swear I can see something staring out at me from in between two trees within the painting.* 

*I thought it had to be my imagination but when I succumbed to paranoia and took a closer look I realized it wasn’t. When I peered close enough I caught the shadow of something tall in the trees, hunched over to the side at an odd and unnatural angle.* 

\-

\-

*More of the portraits in my house have been changed. These changes are both subtle and unnerving. What is stranger is that when one painting changes, the others change back. The shadow of the thing inside the waterfall painting has disappeared.* 

*I want to know if what is going on here can be explained rationally. And if it can’t, I want to understand what the hell this thing is haunting me.* 

*-*

*-*

*I’ve thought about it and I believe getting rid of the remains would be wisest. I can’t emphasize enough how uncomfortable it is to share a house with it - the thing possessing my paintings, which must be somehow connected to the fetish.* 

*I hate being around the paintings once they’ve changed. They’re not so bad after they’ve changed back, but whichever painting possesses the visual anomalies feels alive. Not just alive, but hostile. I honestly feel like the thing inside the paintings despises me.* 

*I’m not overly superstitious but I’d be an idiot to deny there was something evil about the idol I discovered out there.* 

*-*

*-*

*Getting rid of the idol didn’t work. Getting rid of all of the paintings I’ve spotted changes in didn’t work. It keeps switching between other portraits all around the house.* 

*The most recent one it took possession of is a landscape portrait of a small, old fashioned neighborhood from the 1930s. Something is staring out at me through one window, no more than a hazy blur in the greyness of the glass. I took it down and put it away with the other ones.* 

*-*

The following entries described how it moved from one image to another. Tom subsequently developed a phobia of being around portraits and avoided them religiously, going as far as to lock every painting he owned away in his basement. 

His entries became less and less coherent. He discussed how his world was falling apart. The account he wrote painted a sad picture of a depressed and lonely man who needed help but didn’t know how or where to get it.   

I could hardly make sense of the last couple entries. They read like the ramblings of a madman. I wasn’t surprised since Gilbert told me he had been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses in the years leading up to his death.  

Tom scoured his house repeatedly looking for paintings. He claimed to discover different pictures hanging off of his walls every couple of weeks. It became a daily ritual to check his house to make sure no new ones had appeared. He was convinced something awful would happen if the wraith (as he had begun calling it) was left outside of his basement for too long. 

This was where the readable part of the journal ended. The remaining entries were impossible to make sense of. 

I took the journal upstairs and sorted through the paintings. They were the same ones the author described. 

The one at the bottom of the pile was a depiction of a procession of gaunt soldiers from what looked to be WW2, trudging over the remains of a weathered battleground. The soldier’s eyes were fearful and haunted, their faces stark white. 

This photo scared me in an inexplicable way. The longer I looked at it the more mad and deranged the faces of the soldiers appeared. The sensation I felt while around it mirrored the one the author had described - a steadily growing sense of uneasiness which made it difficult to gaze upon the painting for too long. 

One of the first things I did with the portrait was take a photo of it on my phone. Tom had done the same thing a couple of times previously and made a dubious claim. According to him, the effects the portrait had on him didn’t extend to photos of it, no matter how many he took. 

He was right. The portrait looked distinctly different on camera. The faces of the soldiers appeared more grim rather than haunted and the one furthest to the back of the procession wasn’t grinning in a deranged way the way he was in the original picture. 

I took a couple more photographs, still not quite able to believe it, but they all showed the same thing. 

At a housewarming party I showed the war portrait to some friends. They each shared my discomfort when they looked at it. Some of them didn’t get the feeling of dread I described immediately but one by one they each succumbed to it. 

When I showed them the photos they confirmed the differences I noticed were real. They complimented me on my photo editing skills and I had to explain to them that I didn’t do any of this. When I proved the fact by taking another photograph one of my friends came up with an interesting theory. He suggested a special kind of paint could have been used to make the painting appear different in the light of the camera as a picture was being taken. 

Keen to get to the bottom of the mystery, I began testing some of the other claims made by Tom in his diary. I placed the WW2 portrait next to a collection of creepy photos I’d found online and printed out.

The first time it happened was with a photo of a pale, angular face leering out of a dark background. I couldn’t say precisely when it occurred but the wraith took possession of the photo. What had once been a piece of paper with a generic scary image printed on it was now a dark, almost oppressive presence lying on my desk beside me. 

Something else happened, too. The WW2 portrait changed subtly. The soldiers' faces now looked like they did in the photos I took of the portrait. It worked just as Tom had described in his journal. 

Whenever I wasn’t looking directly at one of the photos I could swear the face in it had turned around to stare at me . I frequently looked to check this wasn’t the case but this did little to curb my anxiety.

The effect of the photos seemed to be cumulative over time, the longer the wraith inhabited one photograph. It began as a persistent and intrusive feeling of uneasiness. The longer I spent around the photographs the more they troubled me. The white, angular face began showing up in the corner of my eye. I began to understand why Tom spoke of the portraits the way he did and why he hid so many of them away in the basement. 

If I shared the same room as the wraith I couldn’t bring myself to remain turned away from it for too long - or to look at it for too long, either. And I wasn’t the only one who felt that way. My friends all shared the same sentiment. Once we played a game to see who could look at one of the possessed photos for the longest. The best of us lasted nine minutes before shuddering, turning away and leaving the room. 

There were things the wraith could do which Tom never learned about. But I did. All of what I’d seen so far was only the beginning of what the wraith was capable of. 

One rainy day when I was stuck on a class assignment I elected to take a break and went out to get a coffee. When I came back I noticed something looking back at me from my computer screen which hadn’t been there before. 

It didn’t take me long to pick out the subtle differences in the photo on my screen and deduce what had happened. The wraith had transferred itself onto my computer. What I was looking at was a digital copy of the same leering face I showed you earlier. 

No copy I made of the image file replicated the cognitive effects of the possessed image or the visual differences the wraith had made to it. Modifying the image itself didn’t do anything at first. When I changed it too much the wraith abandoned the image and reattached itself to another one in the same folder. 

I put another image into a parent directory, deleted the possessed one and waited for a response. I didn’t have to wait long. The wraith did what I’d predicted it would do, moving to the image in the other directory. 

A couple of days later I managed to get it inside of a gif. The image depicted a girl standing and staring at her reflection. The animated loop was of the reflection leaning forward and beginning to push its face into the other side of the mirror. The wraith added an extra second to the end of the gif showing the reflection melting through the glass on the girl’s side of the mirror while reaching out for her. This difference was disturbing enough on its own, but I could have sworn the gif was changing a little more each time it played on my screen. 

From time to time the gif would pop up on screen unprompted, stuck in its ceaseless repetition. I began to feel a vague sense of dread while using my computer as I feared another occurrence of the wraith flashing up on my screen. It was a stupid thing to be scared of but I struggled to shake the feeling off. 

Recently I’d watched a slasher flick and I decided to see if the wraith would interact with it. 

Like with the other media there were tangible differences in the possessed version of the film. The murder scenes were more graphic and lasted longer. The movie concluded with a ten second shot of the murderer staring into the camera expressionlessly with no music or noise. 

Upon watching the movie for a second time several more scenes played out where various characters stopped, fell silent, and stared into the screen as the murderer had done. 

The movie mutated further each time I watched it. Scenes became glitched and the subtitles turned into an incomprehensible jumble of characters from a language I couldn’t identify.  

After showing the movie to my friends, they were as unable as I was to explain what they saw. They had seen enough to be convinced the wraith was real, even if I wasn’t so sure of the fact myself. However, none of us were scared by the idea - we were fascinated. 

We were debating what it meant when one of them brought up an intriguing suggestion. 

This little group of ours was in the middle of working on a horror game. It was a passion project the five of us - George, me, Nick, Hayden and Matthew - had envisioned during our first year together at college.  

‘The wraith can inhabit all kinds of media,’ George said, leaning in. ‘What if it could inhabit a video game?’

At his urging, I moved the possessed movie file into the game folder on my computer. When this didn’t have an effect, I deleted the file the wraith had possessed. It turned up in an image file again - this time, a texture within the game.

The game we were working on was an exploration of a large, liminal landscape. There was little story or background - just wandering through an eerie world with an atmosphere inspired by titles ranging from the old Silent Hill games to ActiveWorlds. 

Even though little in the game had been tangibly changed, playing it was a totally different experience. There was an unshakable sense something was hidden in the game with us. Something which wasn’t supposed to be there. 

George in particular was blown away by what the game had become. He got it into his head that we had to find a way to put the wraith into all copies of the game. Then we would release the game and everyone would get to experience what we did while playing it. He was certain it would be a massive success if we could achieve this - he went as far as to claim it might end up being one of the most successful indie horror titles of all time. 

I brought up the significant issue with his plan. There could only be a single copy of the haunted game. My friends could only experience the game like I did when they played it on my computer. Streaming or otherwise recording the game couldn’t effectively recapture the effect playing it had. 

He suggested running the game files through a special program to create duplicates of the wraith. Though it seemed like a dubious prospect to me, I agreed to transfer the file onto a USB drive to give to him. He was convinced he could pull it off and his excitement at the idea was contagious. 

For the next couple of months George dedicated himself to development of the game. The work he did during this time was impressive. In one livestream he toured us through a life sized sports stadium and a fully furnished shopping mall. 

He wanted the experience of the game to be unique for everyone who played it. For this, he had decided to make the world procedurally generated. It was an overly ambitious goal but George was adamant he could pull it off and he already had the code to prove it. 

The progress he’d made was great but it wasn’t what we cared about. We wanted to hear about what he’d done with the wraith.

George admitted he was struggling to control the thing. It was skipping through files in the game too fast for him to keep track of. He assured us he would get on top of the issue and fulfill his promise. We just needed to be patient. 

George was a binge worker. He was typically either procrastinating or feverishly working on something. We were used to seeing him worn out after staying up late completing an assignment the night before it was due. I bring this up to explain why we weren’t initially concerned when we noticed the way George looked during classes. 

We did get a bit worried when he started skipping classes and missed a pair of exams. That concern evolved into worry when Nick overheard he’d bailed out on a family reunion. 

We reached out to him. He admitted his insomnia had come back. He tried to play it all off like it wasn’t a big deal and promised us he intended to see a doctor. Two weeks later, George shared with us another milestone in the game's development. The stalker was a new idea George had added into the game. It would come out after a certain amount of time had elapsed in-game. 

The stalker was supposed to be a physical manifestation of the feeling of something hidden just behind every corner and lurking beyond the walls of fog that the wraith elicited.  

We were a little peeved he’d updated the game in such a major way without consulting with any of us. We might have argued about it, however George was the lead developer of the game and currently the only one working on it at the time. 

Over the course of the two hour livestream he wandered the empty landscapes of the game searching for the stalker and we sat watching him. 

For the first thirty minutes he traversed a metropolis full of stone-still figures staring out of windows from buildings rising unnaturally far into the sky. He wandered around a town square with an oversized, circular fountain where every building was obscured by a dense layer of stagnant mist. 

The creepy atmosphere of the game was offset by banter between us as we watched him play. Yet there was only so long we could fill the void of silence as George roamed restlessly around the empty world. He remained uncomfortably quiet, hardly responding to our attempts to start a conversation, and he became more irritable each time we tried to talk to him. 

*I think I see it,* George announced over the livestream suddenly. 

I didn’t see anything. Neither did any of the other viewers who were still tuned in. 

His avatar had stopped and was staring off toward the slope of a hill upon which a single lonely skyscraper rose into the sky. 

His next comment came after another minute of silence. 

*I keep walking toward this thing but it doesn't seem like I’m getting any closer.* 

*It has turned around, I think.* 

His avatar wasn’t moving at all. He hadn’t moved since he claimed to have seen the stalker. 

There was another pause. 

*You see it, don’t you?*

We all agreed that we could see nothing. 

*I see its face.*

*Bloody hell, there’s something wrong with it, It’s-*  

The livestream continued for a while with George’s avatar staring off into the depths of the grey gloom. We didn’t hear another word from him.

After a full day of no contact from George I went over to his place to check on him in person. 

George laughed his behavior off, telling me he’d felt a little sick and decided to take a break. 

He refused to acknowledge how strangely he’d been acting during the livestream. He couldn’t remember seeing the stalker at all and he couldn’t remember how the livestream ended. 

Following this incident George began to deteriorate more rapidly. His insomnia got worse. You could see signs of it whenever he bothered attending class. He started nodding off frequently. He was always staring off into space with a dull look in his eyes, hardly acknowledging the world going on around him.

George had started a blog a year prior as a game dev diary to keep the small community of fans the game had attracted up to date on its progress. By that time it had become the main way he communicated with the outside world.

*I’m sorry for all the delays in releasing the alpha. Development has been complicated by bugs and some other personal issues going on in my life.* 

*-*

*-*

*A lot of you have been asking, who is the Stalker? I’ve been thinking about this a lot recently. Deliberating over whether it’s better to leave it a mystery for the player to imagine or if I should give a backstory to uncover as they explore. I would appreciate your input on this.* 

*-*

*-*

*I’m hoping to release an update to the demo to show off some of the new stuff I’ve patched in. I’m looking for playtesters.* 

*Tell me you hate the game if you want - I just want to hear some honest input from people.* 

*-*

*-*

*I had a dream last night. In the dream I was wandering around in circles inside a city. It soon dawned on me that I was stuck inside the game.* 

*The stalker was there. It took off its face as if it were some kind of mask. What I saw after that frightened me enough to run like hell away from it. I wish I could tell you what it was I saw but all I can recall is a haze.* 

*I kept running until I couldn't anymore. When I stopped and checked behind me the stalker was gone.* 

*Then somehow I was back where I began my journey. I started to walk again for whatever reason. As is the case many times in dreams I was unable to control my own actions.* 

*Later I found myself at the tall building where I first saw the stalker and the events of the dream repeated themselves. I was confronted with the entity again. It took off its face and I saw what lay beneath. And I ran in terror.* 

*This cycle repeated over and over. Each time the entity revealed itself as something horrifying, though once again, I can’t remember its appearance. I couldn’t tell you if it had a different face each time or the same one.* 

*The dream lasted an uncomfortably long time. It was longer than any other dream I’ve ever had. When I woke up from it I felt as exhausted as if I had spent the whole night awake.*   

*-*

*-*

*I have these dreams every night. They last so long and they seem too real. When I wake up from them I feel as if I haven’t slept at all.* 

*I find it increasingly difficult to focus during the day and I’ve become accustomed to feeling maddeningly tired all the time. I didn’t know it was possible to want to sleep so badly and yet find it so bloody hard to get any proper rest.* 

*The sleeping pills aren’t working anymore. I take them anyway. I’m very dependent on them and I don’t have the energy to deal with the side effects of quitting. At least they make me feel a little less crappy for a while.* 

*-*

Weeks passed before another update was made. I think there were a pair of deleted posts written during the period but I couldn’t recover them. 

Here is the last thing he ever posted:

*-*

*Hi everyone*

*I need to focus on my mental health for a while. I will be pausing work on game development for now.* 

*I’m sorry for all of you who expected a release soon. I can't say when an alpha is going to arrive - or if I’m ever going to pick up this game again, to be honest.* 

*For anyone still tuned in, this is goodbye. For now.* 

*-*

We’d had a talk with him and finally gotten George to understand how seriously he needed help. He’d been persuaded to speak to a new doctor about his sleep issues and he came back with a new prescription. He also acknowledged how obsessed he had become with the game and agreed to take a break from working on it. He was still in a bad state but he’d taken the first steps in getting his life back together. 

I made a mistake then, though I didn’t realize it at the time. I allowed George to keep the possessed copy of the game. As long as the wraith remained in his life, its grip on his mind would never loosen. Not understanding that truth cost George everything. 

A couple of days after our last exchange George was found dead in his apartment. 

It was a seizure, the doctors said. The seizure caused apnea, which was what caused his sudden death. 

The scene must have been traumatizing for his mother who discovered him in his apartment. 

When she’d found him he was lying on the floor. The room was dark except for the flickering light of his computer. It was locked on the game world. George was spread eagled, his face turned to the side and one of his arms was dislocated. 

It felt like so little time ago that I was hanging out at George’s place with a pile of pizzas and some drinks and we were laughing at some silly game he’d created over the weekend for a game jam. The George I remembered was a totally different person from the haggard and mottled skeleton of a person we saw at the funeral. 

The game was abandoned. After a couple months passed we began working on a new project together but without George there to guide and motivate us it lacked the passion and drive it needed to get anywhere. Soon enough we abandoned it too. 

As for the wraith, it sat untouched within an unidentified file on George's computer for a while. His home remained undisturbed for close to a year. 

George’s mother eventually decided to clean up the apartment. She asked us if there was anything of his we wanted to keep. After some deliberation, I agreed to be the one to go back there to retrieve his computer containing the possessed copy of the game. 

My friends and I replayed the game to make sure the wraith hadn’t moved again. Once we agreed that it was still inhabiting the game we deliberated on what to do with it. 

We decided we couldn’t dispose of the computer. The wraith would transfer itself to another conduit and with the new item it would prey on someone else - perhaps another one of us.

After some debate we agreed to have it sealed away instead. We hoped it might remain inactive if it was isolated from people as it had been before I moved into the house. 

Nick rented out a storage unit. We locked the hard drive of the computer in a safebox and we left it there. We hoped to never have to lay eyes on it again. 

For a couple of years our plan actually worked. Nothing could replace the piece of our lives the wraith had stolen but at least now we knew it wouldn’t hurt anyone else. 

Things were complicated when the storage space was robbed. Nothing was stolen from the unit we’d rented but the one next door was completely trashed. Nick elected to move the safebox and its contents to a new, more secure location. Just in case, he said. 

Somewhere along the journey moving it I believe the wraith abandoned the hard drive and attached itself to something in Nick’s car. From there, it followed him home and silently slipped into his life. We didn’t figure out this had happened until much later. 

Since graduating college Nick had become a successful voice actor. He found roles in some video games and a couple of minor tv shows. 

Nick was also an aspiring ventriloquist, something he picked up from his father. His father had been a semi popular ventriloquist during his time and Nick liked to talk about continuing his legacy. 

It should be noted Nick had never been great at ventriloquism. He was convinced he was good at it but he really wasn’t. He loved doing acts onstage but very few could sit through the performances and feel entertained the way he entertained himself. He had a very off brand kind of humor that only he seemed to understand and he didn’t take criticism of his acts very well. 

The fact was Nick was a great voice actor and he had the technique down perfectly for making the dummy appear as if it were talking. But he just couldn’t put together an interesting script and that ruined his performances. 

Everything changed when the wraith returned in its newest form a couple months later. Nick introduced his audiences to Tommy, the ventriloquist dummy he claimed to have discovered stashed away inside the depths of his basement. 

Nick played the role of a submissive character to the dummy, who subjected him to sharing with the audience embarrassing and controversial stories of their years spent together. 

It was a new kind of act and quite different from the material he relied on previously, and it worked out great. The new content was engaging and funny and it stood him out from his competitors. In a couple of weeks he had gone from being a local bar performer to a local sensation. 

I knew the first time I saw him perform with Tommy in person that something was wrong with the dummy. 

I wasn’t the only one who felt that way, either. My friends shared my suspicions. 

My fear was all but confirmed after we visited Nick in person after one show. When I looked into the dummy’s dead, white eyes I sensed something staring back at me. I felt the same way I did when I played our unfinished game and the way I felt being around the possessed portraits.

Nick patiently explained that we were silly to be worried about him. The dummy wasn’t possessed or haunted, he said with a chuckle. He’d convinced himself everything that happened with George was a result of a mental health crisis and the wraith never really existed in the first place. 

The more we pushed him, the more irritable he became. He laughed at us. He called us crazy and claimed we were jealous of his success. He told us we were all pathetic and then threatened to stop speaking to us if we didn’t drop the issue. 

We were still arguing with one another about how to get him to see sense when an unexpected opportunity presented itself. A few weeks later, Nick asked me to review a new act he was working on. I was the only one on good terms with him at the time but I managed to convince Nick to allow his friends to come over so they could apologize to him in person for the previous fight. 

The three of us had agreed to try something more radical. When we came over to visit, Matthew and Hayden. Once they’d both convinced Nick of their remorse we asked to see his newest act and he settled in to show it to us. The moment he got the dummy out, we sprung into action. 

His reaction was comical. He refused to give up on his act as we tried to snatch Tommy out of his hands. The dummy begged him for help as we tried to wrestle it away from him. It started laughing as he chased us through the house, its jaw swinging up and down as Nick ran after us. Nick was making the hysterical laughing sound and yet simultaneously wore a completely horrified expression on his face. 

Once we’d made our escape we smashed it into pieces with a hammer and threw the remains into the trash. 

The very next day Nick was back on stage with the same dummy, which didn’t have a scratch on it, acting like nothing had happened. He refused to speak to any of us again after that. 

We returned to researching the origins of the entity hoping to find a way to get rid of the source of our problems. I won’t get into this much because it was a futile exercise. When we asked for help online the responses we got ranged from disbelieving to making fun of us. We talked to two people who claimed they could help us but they both turned out to be trolls. That was about the extent of it. 

The wraith was manipulating Nick, I suspected. It gave him a taste of fame and success like he’d never experienced before and got him drunk on it. He quickly became dependent on the dummy since he couldn’t perform without it. 

Over time, Nick’s performances became increasingly disturbing and provocative. I continued to see them sporadically after our fallout, still convinced I could somehow get through to him. They were difficult to sit through. 

He knew certain things about the audience, who he frequently interacted with. The interactions he shared with people left many uncomfortable or offended. Others were entertained by his uncanny abilities and provocative personality. I saw people who were in hysterics after watching his performances and talked to others who were religious, fanatic fans of his. 

As its grip over his mind tightened, Nick began to talk to the dummy outside of shows. This was first spotted by his family but it became obvious to everyone else around him in time. He had begun taking it with him wherever he went. Near the end his brother claimed he never saw Nick without Tommy latched onto him. It had become his permanent companion. A part of him. 

This behavior didn’t do wonders for his reputation but by then he had accumulated a loyal band of followers who didn’t care how eccentric and messed up he acted. The wraith gave him the success he'd dreamed of since he was a child but it did so at an unspeakable price. 

As for what happened to Nick, we never figured out a way to help him. The last place he was ever seen was somewhere strange called the Grand Circus of Mysteries. He worked there for a while as one of the star performers before inexplicably disappearing off the face of the earth following a particularly disturbed act. The dummy left with him, but I had no doubt the thing living inside it was still lurking out there somewhere. 

I lost track of the entity for a while after it had finished with Nick. I assumed it had gone on to haunt somebody else's life. Personally I wanted nothing more to do with it. 

My remaining moved out of town and I soon lost contact with them. I think we all felt responsible for failing Nick and we saw each other as reminders of this failure. It was better for all of us if we put the past behind us and moved on with our separate lives. 

I was watching the news one day some years later. The anchor began discussing a sinkhole which had appeared in a stretch of desolate plains outside of my hometown. They described it as a black hole in the ground which sucked in all the light from around it. 

I visited the place in person a couple days later. By then half the people in town had gone over to take a look. 

I approached close enough to lean over and look down into the depths of the cave. When I gazed into the abyss I felt something deep within staring back up at me. 

There I fell into a kind of daze. I felt as if I were falling into the blackness. The world around me became unreal and distant. 

My wife who’d gone out there with me claimed I stood over the hole for over a minute, swaying slightly as I stared down into it. 

It was her who broke me out of my trance. She had to slap me several times before I returned to my senses. By then, I was leaning over far enough that she swore I was about to fall in. 

I’ve been keeping track of the sinkhole since I visited it. I heard a group of kids dared someone to venture inside shortly after I went there. Jeff, I believe his name was. 

He reappeared a couple of days later with no recollection of having gone missing. 

I saw an older version of this boy in the news the other day, nearly ten years later. After I heard about what he did I figured it was time for me to finally get this story out there. 

I’m guessing the wraith has moved on from him by now. Perhaps it returned to the sinkhole, or maybe it has attached itself to a new conduit. Wherever it is, I don’t doubt it is searching for another victim.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

He then tried to lock me in the store

And every time im in this shop this creep is looking at his phone and glaring up at me from a distance 

The guy doesnt seem to realise im sickened by him 

How do you deal with these people . You know people who know they have absolutley no chance in hell so they try to make you uncomfortable instead just to get a reaction

1iun066,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1iun066/something_sinister_lived_within_my_paintings/,Something Sinister Lived Within My Paintings,"‘Tom went mad,’ Gilbert said. ‘Schizophrenia or something, I think. He stopped leaving the place completely. After a month of being pent up inside he died of starvation.’ 

‘He was a hoarder. A serious one. It took weeks to get the home cleaned up, and even then there’s still some junk in the basement the cleaners left there. I’d be curious to have a look and see if there’s anything valuable.’ He snorted. ‘I doubt it though.’ 

I sorted through what remained of the clutter and determined most of it to be worthless. There were shelves full of dusty tools and stacks of used furniture. Shoved up against the wall was a large mattress with dirty, stained sheets and old clothes piled on top of it. 

There was one thing I uncovered which did catch my attention. In the far back corner of the basement something was hidden underneath a white sheet: a chest, turned back to face the wall. Within the chest I discovered a diary and a stack of paintings.. 

I skimmed through the diary first. Below I’ve copied out some of the stranger entries as I read them:

\-

*I had one of the oddest experiences of my life today.* 

*It started with a dream. From what I could recall I was fleeing from something. I don’t remember what it looked like. I know it was huge - on a cosmic scale. And it wasn’t supposed to exist. I’m not sure if that makes sense but describing the thing at all is difficult for me.* 

*I woke up from the dream with my head throbbing and sweat covering my body. My throat was dry and raw. My ears were ringing. Something felt wrong.* 

*When I went outside the following morning what I saw was bizarre. It looked like a bolt of lightning had struck the ground at the edge of the stretch of hayfields extending past my backyard. The immediate section of corn was blackened and withered, the corn further out a sickly brown color.* 

*In the center of the circle of scorched earth sat a hand sized stone totem. Four uncanny faces decorated each of its sides. They appeared almost but not quite human. Two were screaming, the other two bore grins which extended unnaturally wide. The piece of stone was stained on one side with a blotch of reddish brown.* 

*-*

The previous homeowner took the totem back to his house and put it in the basement. The next couple of entries deliberated over various other aspects of his life. I was intrigued enough to keep skimming through the diary and my curiosity was soon rewarded. 

\-

*Something happened to one of my paintings. I’m writing this down to help me understand it.* 

*I have owned the painting for years. It has been here since before my parents moved in. It’s the type of thing you live with for such a long time you never really notice it. Yet now every time I sit in the room with it I swear I can feel the painting watching me.* 

*-*

He went on to describe the painting - an old man sitting on a table with a walking stick in one hand, the other holding a pair of spectacles up to his eyes. When he had examined it closer, Tom noticed something about the painting had changed. 

\-

*The man looks different. He looks scared. And there is a long, tall shadow in the shadows behind him, only barely visible, but it's definitely there.* 

*After a couple days I took it off the wall and put it away in the basement. That was when I noticed the idol had fallen off the shelf it had been sitting on. It has shattered into several pieces.* 

*The idol no longer gave off the sense of malice it did when I found it. But that’s not to say the feeling has gone - it hasn’t.* 

*-*

*-*

*I went back down to the basement. I checked on both the remains of the idol and the watercolor painting. I previously described my discomfort being around the portrait of the old man but that instinct is gone now. The painting itself appears normal again. Just an old man staring at the viewer with an expression suggesting him to be deep in thought.* 

*Upstairs I have a couple of other portraits hanging up around my house. One is of a little waterfall in a forest. Now out of the corner of my eye I swear I can see something staring out at me from in between two trees within the painting.* 

*I thought it had to be my imagination but when I succumbed to paranoia and took a closer look I realized it wasn’t. When I peered close enough I caught the shadow of something tall in the trees, hunched over to the side at an odd and unnatural angle.* 

\-

\-

*More of the portraits in my house have been changed. These changes are both subtle and unnerving. What is stranger is that when one painting changes, the others change back. The shadow of the thing inside the waterfall painting has disappeared.* 

*I want to know if what is going on here can be explained rationally. And if it can’t, I want to understand what the hell this thing is haunting me.* 

*-*

*-*

*I’ve thought about it and I believe getting rid of the remains would be wisest. I can’t emphasize enough how uncomfortable it is to share a house with it - the thing possessing my paintings, which must be somehow connected to the fetish.* 

*I hate being around the paintings once they’ve changed. They’re not so bad after they’ve changed back, but whichever painting possesses the visual anomalies feels alive. Not just alive, but hostile. I honestly feel like the thing inside the paintings despises me.* 

*I’m not overly superstitious but I’d be an idiot to deny there was something evil about the idol I discovered out there.* 

*-*

*-*

*Getting rid of the idol didn’t work. Getting rid of all of the paintings I’ve spotted changes in didn’t work. It keeps switching between other portraits all around the house.* 

*The most recent one it took possession of is a landscape portrait of a small, old fashioned neighborhood from the 1930s. Something is staring out at me through one window, no more than a hazy blur in the greyness of the glass. I took it down and put it away with the other ones.* 

*-*

The following entries described how it moved from one image to another. Tom subsequently developed a phobia of being around portraits and avoided them religiously, going as far as to lock every painting he owned away in his basement. 

His entries became less and less coherent. He discussed how his world was falling apart. The account he wrote painted a sad picture of a depressed and lonely man who needed help but didn’t know how or where to get it.   

I could hardly make sense of the last couple entries. They read like the ramblings of a madman. I wasn’t surprised since Gilbert told me he had been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses in the years leading up to his death.  

Tom scoured his house repeatedly looking for paintings. He claimed to discover different pictures hanging off of his walls every couple of weeks. It became a daily ritual to check his house to make sure no new ones had appeared. He was convinced something awful would happen if the wraith (as he had begun calling it) was left outside of his basement for too long. 

This was where the readable part of the journal ended. The remaining entries were impossible to make sense of. 

I took the journal upstairs and sorted through the paintings. They were the same ones the author described. 

The one at the bottom of the pile was a depiction of a procession of gaunt soldiers from what looked to be WW2, trudging over the remains of a weathered battleground. The soldier’s eyes were fearful and haunted, their faces stark white. 

This photo scared me in an inexplicable way. The longer I looked at it the more mad and deranged the faces of the soldiers appeared. The sensation I felt while around it mirrored the one the author had described - a steadily growing sense of uneasiness which made it difficult to gaze upon the painting for too long. 

One of the first things I did with the portrait was take a photo of it on my phone. Tom had done the same thing a couple of times previously and made a dubious claim. According to him, the effects the portrait had on him didn’t extend to photos of it, no matter how many he took. 

He was right. The portrait looked distinctly different on camera. The faces of the soldiers appeared more grim rather than haunted and the one furthest to the back of the procession wasn’t grinning in a deranged way the way he was in the original picture. 

I took a couple more photographs, still not quite able to believe it, but they all showed the same thing. 

At a housewarming party I showed the war portrait to some friends. They each shared my discomfort when they looked at it. Some of them didn’t get the feeling of dread I described immediately but one by one they each succumbed to it. 

When I showed them the photos they confirmed the differences I noticed were real. They complimented me on my photo editing skills and I had to explain to them that I didn’t do any of this. When I proved the fact by taking another photograph one of my friends came up with an interesting theory. He suggested a special kind of paint could have been used to make the painting appear different in the light of the camera as a picture was being taken. 

Keen to get to the bottom of the mystery, I began testing some of the other claims made by Tom in his diary. I placed the WW2 portrait next to a collection of creepy photos I’d found online and printed out.

The first time it happened was with a photo of a pale, angular face leering out of a dark background. I couldn’t say precisely when it occurred but the wraith took possession of the photo. What had once been a piece of paper with a generic scary image printed on it was now a dark, almost oppressive presence lying on my desk beside me. 

Something else happened, too. The WW2 portrait changed subtly. The soldiers' faces now looked like they did in the photos I took of the portrait. It worked just as Tom had described in his journal. 

Linked with this post are two of the images it attached itself to. The following picture is the second one the wraith found its way into as a result of my experimentation with it. 

Whenever I wasn’t looking directly at the second photo I could swear the face had turned around to stare at me directly. I frequently looked to check this wasn’t the case but this did little to curb my anxiety.

The effect of the photos seemed to be cumulative over time, the longer the wraith inhabited one photograph. It began as a persistent and intrusive feeling of uneasiness. The longer I spent around the photographs the more they troubled me. The white, angular face began showing up in the corner of my eye. I began to understand why Tom spoke of the portraits the way he did and why he hid so many of them away in the basement. 

If I shared the same room as the wraith I couldn’t bring myself to remain turned away from it for too long - or to look at it for too long, either. And I wasn’t the only one who felt that way. My friends all shared the same sentiment. Once we played a game to see who could look at one of the possessed photos for the longest. The best of us lasted nine minutes before shuddering, turning away and leaving the room. 

There were things the wraith could do which Tom never learned about. But I did. All of what I’d seen so far was only the beginning of what the wraith was capable of. 

One rainy day when I was stuck on a class assignment I elected to take a break and went out to get a coffee. When I came back I noticed something looking back at me from my computer screen which hadn’t been there before. 

It didn’t take me long to pick out the subtle differences in the photo on my screen and deduce what had happened. The wraith had transferred itself onto my computer. What I was looking at was a digital copy of the same leering face I showed you earlier. 

No copy I made of the image file replicated the cognitive effects of the possessed image or the visual differences the wraith had made to it. Modifying the image itself didn’t do anything at first. When I changed it too much the wraith abandoned the image and reattached itself to another one in the same folder. 

I put another image into a parent directory, deleted the possessed one and waited for a response. I didn’t have to wait long. The wraith did what I’d predicted it would do, moving to the image in the other directory. 

A couple of days later I managed to get it inside of a gif. The image depicted a girl standing and staring at her reflection. The animated loop was of the reflection leaning forward and beginning to push its face into the other side of the mirror. The wraith added an extra second to the end of the gif showing the reflection melting through the glass on the girl’s side of the mirror while reaching out for her. This difference was disturbing enough on its own, but I could have sworn the gif was changing a little more each time it played on my screen. 

From time to time the gif would pop up on screen unprompted, stuck in its ceaseless repetition. I began to feel a vague sense of dread while using my computer as I feared another occurrence of the wraith flashing up on my screen. It was a stupid thing to be scared of but I struggled to shake the feeling off. 

Recently I’d watched a slasher flick and I decided to see if the wraith would interact with it. 

Like with the other media there were tangible differences in the possessed version of the film. The murder scenes were more graphic and lasted longer. The movie concluded with a ten second shot of the murderer staring into the camera expressionlessly with no music or noise. 

Upon watching the movie for a second time several more scenes played out where various characters stopped, fell silent, and stared into the screen as the murderer had done. 

The movie mutated further each time I watched it. Scenes became glitched and the subtitles turned into an incomprehensible jumble of characters from a language I couldn’t identify.  

After showing the movie to my friends, they were as unable as I was to explain what they saw. They had seen enough to be convinced the wraith was real, even if I wasn’t so sure of the fact myself. However, none of us were scared by the idea - we were fascinated. 

We were debating what it meant when one of them brought up an intriguing suggestion. 

This little group of ours was in the middle of working on a horror game. It was a passion project the five of us - George, me, Nick, Hayden and Matthew - had envisioned during our first year together at college.  

‘The wraith can inhabit all kinds of media,’ George said, leaning in. ‘What if it could inhabit a video game?’

At his urging, I moved the possessed movie file into the game folder on my computer. When this didn’t have an effect, I deleted the file the wraith had possessed. It turned up in an image file again - this time, a texture within the game.

The game we were working on was an exploration of a large, liminal landscape. There was little story or background - just wandering through an eerie world with an atmosphere inspired by titles ranging from the old Silent Hill games to ActiveWorlds. 

Even though little in the game had been tangibly changed, playing it was a totally different experience. There was an unshakable sense something was hidden in the game with us. Something which wasn’t supposed to be there. 

George in particular was blown away by what the game had become. He got it into his head that we had to find a way to put the wraith into all copies of the game. Then we would release the game and everyone would get to experience what we did while playing it. He was certain it would be a massive success if we could achieve this - he went as far as to claim it might end up being one of the most successful indie horror titles of all time. 

I brought up the significant issue with his plan. There could only be a single copy of the haunted game. My friends could only experience the game like I did when they played it on my computer. Streaming or otherwise recording the game couldn’t effectively recapture the effect playing it had. 

He suggested running the game files through a special program to create duplicates of the wraith. Though it seemed like a dubious prospect to me, I agreed to transfer the file onto a USB drive to give to him. He was convinced he could pull it off and his excitement at the idea was contagious. 

For the next couple of months George dedicated himself to development of the game. The work he did during this time was impressive. In one livestream he toured us through a life sized sports stadium and a fully furnished shopping mall. 

He wanted the experience of the game to be unique for everyone who played it. For this, he had decided to make the world procedurally generated. It was an overly ambitious goal but George was adamant he could pull it off and he already had the code to prove it. 

The progress he’d made was great but it wasn’t what we cared about. We wanted to hear about what he’d done with the wraith.

George admitted he was struggling to control the thing. It was skipping through files in the game too fast for him to keep track of. He assured us he would get on top of the issue and fulfill his promise. We just needed to be patient. 

George was a binge worker. He was typically either procrastinating or feverishly working on something. We were used to seeing him worn out after staying up late completing an assignment the night before it was due. I bring this up to explain why we weren’t initially concerned when we noticed the way George looked during classes. 

We did get a bit worried when he started skipping classes and missed a pair of exams. That concern evolved into worry when Nick overheard he’d bailed out on a family reunion. 

We reached out to him. He admitted his insomnia had come back. He tried to play it all off like it wasn’t a big deal and promised us he intended to see a doctor. Two weeks later, George shared with us another milestone in the game's development. The stalker was a new idea George had added into the game. It would come out after a certain amount of time had elapsed in-game. 

The stalker was supposed to be a physical manifestation of the feeling of something hidden just behind every corner and lurking beyond the walls of fog that the wraith elicited.  

We were a little peeved he’d updated the game in such a major way without consulting with any of us. We might have argued about it, however George was the lead developer of the game and currently the only one working on it at the time. 

Over the course of the two hour livestream he wandered the empty landscapes of the game searching for the stalker and we sat watching him. 

For the first thirty minutes he traversed a metropolis full of stone-still figures staring out of windows from buildings rising unnaturally far into the sky. He wandered around a town square with an oversized, circular fountain where every building was obscured by a dense layer of stagnant mist. 

The creepy atmosphere of the game was offset by banter between us as we watched him play. Yet there was only so long we could fill the void of silence as George roamed restlessly around the empty world. He remained uncomfortably quiet, hardly responding to our attempts to start a conversation, and he became more irritable each time we tried to talk to him. 

*I think I see it,* George announced over the livestream suddenly. 

I didn’t see anything. Neither did any of the other viewers who were still tuned in. 

His avatar had stopped and was staring off toward the slope of a hill upon which a single lonely skyscraper rose into the sky. 

His next comment came after another minute of silence. 

*I keep walking toward this thing but it doesn't seem like I’m getting any closer.* 

*It has turned around, I think.* 

His avatar wasn’t moving at all. He hadn’t moved since he claimed to have seen the stalker. 

There was another pause. 

*You see it, don’t you?*

We all agreed that we could see nothing. 

*I see its face.*

*Bloody hell, there’s something wrong with it, It’s-*  

The livestream continued for a while with George’s avatar staring off into the depths of the grey gloom. We didn’t hear another word from him.

After a full day of no contact from George I went over to his place to check on him in person. 

George laughed his behavior off, telling me he’d felt a little sick and decided to take a break. 

He refused to acknowledge how strangely he’d been acting during the livestream. He couldn’t remember seeing the stalker at all and he couldn’t remember how the livestream ended. 

Following this incident George began to deteriorate more rapidly. His insomnia got worse. You could see signs of it whenever he bothered attending class. He started nodding off frequently. He was always staring off into space with a dull look in his eyes, hardly acknowledging the world going on around him.

George had started a blog a year prior as a game dev diary to keep the small community of fans the game had attracted up to date on its progress. By that time it had become the main way he communicated with the outside world.

\-

*I’m sorry for all the delays in releasing the alpha. Development has been complicated by bugs and some other personal issues going on in my life.* 

*-*

*-*

*A lot of you have been asking, who is the Stalker? I’ve been thinking about this a lot recently. Deliberating over whether it’s better to leave it a mystery for the player to imagine or if I should give a backstory to uncover as they explore. I would appreciate your input on this.* 

*-*

*-*

*I’m hoping to release an update to the demo to show off some of the new stuff I’ve patched in. I’m looking for playtesters.* 

*Tell me you hate the game if you want - I just want to hear some honest input from people.* 

*-*

*-*

*I had a dream last night. In the dream I was wandering around in circles inside a city. It soon dawned on me that I was stuck inside the game.* 

*The stalker was there. It took off its face as if it were some kind of mask. What I saw after that frightened me enough to run like hell away from it. I wish I could tell you what it was I saw but all I can recall is a haze.* 

*I kept running until I couldn't anymore. When I stopped and checked behind me the stalker was gone.* 

*Then somehow I was back where I began my journey. I started to walk again for whatever reason. As is the case many times in dreams I was unable to control my own actions.* 

*Later I found myself at the tall building where I first saw the stalker and the events of the dream repeated themselves. I was confronted with the entity again. It took off its face and I saw what lay beneath. And I ran in terror.* 

*This cycle repeated over and over. Each time the entity revealed itself as something horrifying, though once again, I can’t remember its appearance. I couldn’t tell you if it had a different face each time or the same one.* 

*The dream lasted an uncomfortably long time. It was longer than any other dream I’ve ever had. When I woke up from it I felt as exhausted as if I had spent the whole night awake.*   

*-*

*-*

*I have these dreams every night. They last so long and they seem too real. When I wake up from them I feel as if I haven’t slept at all.* 

*I find it increasingly difficult to focus during the day and I’ve become accustomed to feeling maddeningly tired all the time. I didn’t know it was possible to want to sleep so badly and yet find it so bloody hard to get any proper rest.* 

*The sleeping pills aren’t working anymore. I take them anyway. I’m very dependent on them and I don’t have the energy to deal with the side effects of quitting. At least they make me feel a little less crappy for a while.* 

*-*

Weeks passed before another update was made. I think there were a pair of deleted posts written during the period but I couldn’t recover them. 

Here is the last thing he ever posted:

*-*

*Hi everyone*

*I need to focus on my mental health for a while. I will be pausing work on game development for now.* 

*I’m sorry for all of you who expected a release soon. I can't say when an alpha is going to arrive - or if I’m ever going to pick up this game again, to be honest.* 

*For anyone still tuned in, this is goodbye. For now.* 

*-*

We’d had a talk with him and finally gotten George to understand how seriously he needed help. He’d been persuaded to speak to a new doctor about his sleep issues and he came back with a new prescription. He also acknowledged how obsessed he had become with the game and agreed to take a break from working on it. He was still in a bad state but he’d taken the first steps in getting his life back together. 

I made a mistake then, though I didn’t realize it at the time. I allowed George to keep the possessed copy of the game. As long as the wraith remained in his life, its grip on his mind would never loosen. Not understanding that truth cost George everything. 

A couple of days after our last exchange George was found dead in his apartment. 

It was a seizure, the doctors said. The seizure caused apnea, which was what caused his sudden death. 

The scene must have been traumatizing for his mother who discovered him in his apartment. 

When she’d found him he was lying on the floor. The room was dark except for the flickering light of his computer. It was locked on the game world. George was spread eagled, his face turned to the side and one of his arms was dislocated. 

It felt like so little time ago that I was hanging out at George’s place with a pile of pizzas and some drinks and we were laughing at some silly game he’d created over the weekend for a game jam. The George I remembered was a totally different person from the haggard and mottled skeleton of a person we saw at the funeral. 

The game was abandoned. After a couple months passed we began working on a new project together but without George there to guide and motivate us it lacked the passion and drive it needed to get anywhere. Soon enough we abandoned it too. 

As for the wraith, it sat untouched within an unidentified file on George's computer for a while. His home remained undisturbed for close to a year. 

George’s mother eventually decided to clean up the apartment. She asked us if there was anything of his we wanted to keep. After some deliberation, I agreed to be the one to go back there to retrieve his computer containing the possessed copy of the game. 

My friends and I replayed the game to make sure the wraith hadn’t moved again. Once we agreed that it was still inhabiting the game we deliberated on what to do with it. 

We decided we couldn’t dispose of the computer. The wraith would transfer itself to another conduit and with the new item it would prey on someone else - perhaps another one of us.

After some debate we agreed to have it sealed away instead. We hoped it might remain inactive if it was isolated from people as it had been before I moved into the house. 

Nick rented out a storage unit. We locked the hard drive of the computer in a safebox and we left it there. We hoped to never have to lay eyes on it again. 

For a couple of years our plan actually worked. Nothing could replace the piece of our lives the wraith had stolen but at least now we knew it wouldn’t hurt anyone else. 

Things were complicated when the storage space was robbed. Nothing was stolen from the unit we’d rented but the one next door was completely trashed. Nick elected to move the safebox and its contents to a new, more secure location. Just in case, he said. 

Somewhere along the journey moving it I believe the wraith abandoned the hard drive and attached itself to something in Nick’s car. From there, it followed him home and silently slipped into his life. We didn’t figure out this had happened until much later. 

Since graduating college Nick had become a successful voice actor. He found roles in some video games and a couple of minor tv shows. 

Nick was also an aspiring ventriloquist, something he picked up from his father. His father had been a semi popular ventriloquist during his time and Nick liked to talk about continuing his legacy. 

It should be noted Nick had never been great at ventriloquism. He was convinced he was good at it but he really wasn’t. He loved doing acts onstage but very few could sit through the performances and feel entertained the way he entertained himself. He had a very off brand kind of humor that only he seemed to understand and he didn’t take criticism of his acts very well. 

The fact was Nick was a great voice actor and he had the technique down perfectly for making the dummy appear as if it were talking. But he just couldn’t put together an interesting script and that ruined his performances. 

Everything changed when the wraith returned in its newest form a couple months later. Nick introduced his audiences to Tommy, the ventriloquist dummy he claimed to have discovered stashed away inside the depths of his basement. 

Nick played the role of a submissive character to the dummy, who subjected him to sharing with the audience embarrassing and controversial stories of their years spent together. 

It was a new kind of act and quite different from the material he relied on previously, and it worked out great. The new content was engaging and funny and it stood him out from his competitors. In a couple of weeks he had gone from being a local bar performer to a local sensation. 

I knew the first time I saw him perform with Tommy in person that something was wrong with the dummy. 

I wasn’t the only one who felt that way, either. My friends shared my suspicions. 

My fear was all but confirmed after we visited Nick in person after one show. When I looked into the dummy’s dead, white eyes I sensed something staring back at me. I felt the same way I did when I played our unfinished game and the way I felt being around the possessed portraits.

Nick patiently explained that we were silly to be worried about him. The dummy wasn’t possessed or haunted, he said with a chuckle. He’d convinced himself everything that happened with George was a result of a mental health crisis and the wraith never really existed in the first place. 

The more we pushed him, the more irritable he became. He laughed at us. He called us crazy and claimed we were jealous of his success. He told us we were all pathetic and then threatened to stop speaking to us if we didn’t drop the issue. 

We were still arguing with one another about how to get him to see sense when an unexpected opportunity presented itself. A few weeks later, Nick asked me to review a new act he was working on. I was the only one on good terms with him at the time but I managed to convince Nick to allow his friends to come over so they could apologize to him in person for the previous fight. 

The three of us had agreed to try something more radical. When we came over to visit, Matthew and Hayden. Once they’d both convinced Nick of their remorse we asked to see his newest act and he settled in to show it to us. The moment he got the dummy out, we sprung into action. 

His reaction was comical. He refused to give up on his act as we tried to snatch Tommy out of his hands. The dummy begged him for help as we tried to wrestle it away from him. It started laughing as he chased us through the house, its jaw swinging up and down as Nick ran after us. Nick was making the hysterical laughing sound and yet simultaneously wore a completely horrified expression on his face. 

Once we’d made our escape we smashed it into pieces with a hammer and threw the remains into the trash. 

The very next day Nick was back on stage with the same dummy, which didn’t have a scratch on it, acting like nothing had happened. He refused to speak to any of us again after that. 

We returned to researching the origins of the entity hoping to find a way to get rid of the source of our problems. I won’t get into this much because it was a futile exercise. When we asked for help online the responses we got ranged from disbelieving to making fun of us. We talked to two people who claimed they could help us but they both turned out to be trolls. That was about the extent of it. 

The wraith was manipulating Nick, I suspected. It gave him a taste of fame and success like he’d never experienced before and got him drunk on it. He quickly became dependent on the dummy since he couldn’t perform without it. 

Over time, Nick’s performances became increasingly disturbing and provocative. I continued to see them sporadically after our fallout, still convinced I could somehow get through to him. They were difficult to sit through. 

He knew certain things about the audience, who he frequently interacted with. The interactions he shared with people left many uncomfortable or offended. Others were entertained by his uncanny abilities and provocative personality. I saw people who were in hysterics after watching his performances and talked to others who were religious, fanatic fans of his. 

As its grip over his mind tightened, Nick began to talk to the dummy outside of shows. This was first spotted by his family but it became obvious to everyone else around him in time. He had begun taking it with him wherever he went. Near the end his brother claimed he never saw Nick without Tommy latched onto him. It had become his permanent companion. A part of him. 

This behavior didn’t do wonders for his reputation but by then he had accumulated a loyal band of followers who didn’t care how eccentric and messed up he acted. The wraith gave him the success he'd dreamed of since he was a child but it did so at an unspeakable price. 

As for what happened to Nick, we never figured out a way to help him. The last place he was ever seen was somewhere strange called the Grand Circus of Mysteries. He worked there for a while as one of the star performers before inexplicably disappearing off the face of the earth following a particularly disturbed act. The dummy left with him, but I had no doubt the thing living inside it was still lurking out there somewhere. 

I lost track of the entity for a while after it had finished with Nick. I assumed it had gone on to haunt somebody else's life. Personally I wanted nothing more to do with it. 

My remaining moved out of town and I soon lost contact with them. I think we all felt responsible for failing Nick and we saw each other as reminders of this failure. It was better for all of us if we put the past behind us and moved on with our separate lives. 

I was watching the news one day some years later. The anchor began discussing a sinkhole which had appeared in a stretch of desolate plains outside of my hometown. They described it as a black hole in the ground which sucked in all the light from around it. 

I visited the place in person a couple days later. By then half the people in town had gone over to take a look. 

I approached close enough to lean over and look down into the depths of the cave. When I gazed into the abyss I felt something deep within staring back up at me. 

There I fell into a kind of daze. I felt as if I were falling into the blackness. The world around me became unreal and distant. 

My wife who’d gone out there with me claimed I stood over the hole for over a minute, swaying slightly as I stared down into it. 

It was her who broke me out of my trance. She had to slap me several times before I returned to my senses. By then, I was leaning over far enough that she swore I was about to fall in. 

I’ve been keeping track of the sinkhole since I visited it. I heard a group of kids dared someone to venture inside shortly after I went there. Jeff, I believe his name was. 

He reappeared a couple of days later with no recollection of having gone missing. 

I saw an older version of this boy in the news the other day, nearly ten years later. After I heard about what he did I figured it was time for me to finally get this story out there. 

I’m guessing the wraith has moved on from him by now. Perhaps it returned to the sinkhole, or maybe it has attached itself to a new conduit. Wherever it is, I don’t doubt it is searching for another victim. ",1,1740130146.0,DrCreepensVault,0,1.0,False

I’d say my palate is generally fairly average to poor (something I’ve come to terms with over the past decade). I’ve only recently started drinking pour over, having mainly drunk espresso, and I’ve struggled to find light bodied, fruity and sweet pour overs which I’ve had in coffee shops.

These were a revelation, one of the first times I’ve ever properly picked up specific fruits, but the sweet apricot (apricot jam?) flavour was incredible. I’m using a V60 and Sculptor 078.

My main question is where does this flavour come from? Is it the roast, bean quality, varietal, or process? Or most likely a combination of all factors? I’m not entirely sure what the thermal shock/yeast inoculated process involves, but I’ll be keeping my eyes out for more.

1iumxkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkGathering/comments/1iumxkc/something_sinister_lived_within_my_paintings/,Something Sinister Lived Within My Paintings,"‘Tom went mad,’ Gilbert said. ‘Schizophrenia or something, I think. He stopped leaving the place completely. After a month of being pent up inside he died of starvation.’ 

‘He was a hoarder. A serious one. It took weeks to get the home cleaned up, and even then there’s still some junk in the basement the cleaners left there. I’d be curious to have a look and see if there’s anything valuable.’ He snorted. ‘I doubt it though.’ 

I sorted through what remained of the clutter and determined most of it to be worthless. There were shelves full of dusty tools and stacks of used furniture. Shoved up against the wall was a large mattress with dirty, stained sheets and old clothes piled on top of it. 

There was one thing I uncovered which did catch my attention. In the far back corner of the basement something was hidden underneath a white sheet: a chest, turned back to face the wall. Within the chest I discovered a diary and a stack of paintings.. 

I skimmed through the diary first. Below I’ve copied out some of the stranger entries as I read them:

\-

*I had one of the oddest experiences of my life today.* 

*It started with a dream. From what I could recall I was fleeing from something. I don’t remember what it looked like. I know it was huge - on a cosmic scale. And it wasn’t supposed to exist. I’m not sure if that makes sense but describing the thing at all is difficult for me.* 

*I woke up from the dream with my head throbbing and sweat covering my body. My throat was dry and raw. My ears were ringing. Something felt wrong.* 

*When I went outside the following morning what I saw was bizarre. It looked like a bolt of lightning had struck the ground at the edge of the stretch of hayfields extending past my backyard. The immediate section of corn was blackened and withered, the corn further out a sickly brown color.* 

*In the center of the circle of scorched earth sat a hand sized stone totem. Four uncanny faces decorated each of its sides. They appeared almost but not quite human. Two were screaming, the other two bore grins which extended unnaturally wide. The piece of stone was stained on one side with a blotch of reddish brown.* 

*-*

The previous homeowner took the totem back to his house and put it in the basement. The next couple of entries deliberated over various other aspects of his life. I was intrigued enough to keep skimming through the diary and my curiosity was soon rewarded. 

\-

*Something happened to one of my paintings. I’m writing this down to help me understand it.* 

*I have owned the painting for years. It has been here since before my parents moved in. It’s the type of thing you live with for such a long time you never really notice it. Yet now every time I sit in the room with it I swear I can feel the painting watching me.* 

*-*

He went on to describe the painting - an old man sitting on a table with a walking stick in one hand, the other holding a pair of spectacles up to his eyes. When he had examined it closer, Tom noticed something about the painting had changed. 

\-

*The man looks different. He looks scared. And there is a long, tall shadow in the shadows behind him, only barely visible, but it's definitely there.* 

*After a couple days I took it off the wall and put it away in the basement. That was when I noticed the idol had fallen off the shelf it had been sitting on. It has shattered into several pieces.* 

*The idol no longer gave off the sense of malice it did when I found it. But that’s not to say the feeling has gone - it hasn’t.* 

*-*

*-*

*I went back down to the basement. I checked on both the remains of the idol and the watercolor painting. I previously described my discomfort being around the portrait of the old man but that instinct is gone now. The painting itself appears normal again. Just an old man staring at the viewer with an expression suggesting him to be deep in thought.* 

*Upstairs I have a couple of other portraits hanging up around my house. One is of a little waterfall in a forest. Now out of the corner of my eye I swear I can see something staring out at me from in between two trees within the painting.* 

*I thought it had to be my imagination but when I succumbed to paranoia and took a closer look I realized it wasn’t. When I peered close enough I caught the shadow of something tall in the trees, hunched over to the side at an odd and unnatural angle.* 

\-

\-

*More of the portraits in my house have been changed. These changes are both subtle and unnerving. What is stranger is that when one painting changes, the others change back. The shadow of the thing inside the waterfall painting has disappeared.* 

*I want to know if what is going on here can be explained rationally. And if it can’t, I want to understand what the hell this thing is haunting me.* 

*-*

*-*

*I’ve thought about it and I believe getting rid of the remains would be wisest. I can’t emphasize enough how uncomfortable it is to share a house with it - the thing possessing my paintings, which must be somehow connected to the fetish.* 

*I hate being around the paintings once they’ve changed. They’re not so bad after they’ve changed back, but whichever painting possesses the visual anomalies feels alive. Not just alive, but hostile. I honestly feel like the thing inside the paintings despises me.* 

*I’m not overly superstitious but I’d be an idiot to deny there was something evil about the idol I discovered out there.* 

*-*

*-*

*Getting rid of the idol didn’t work. Getting rid of all of the paintings I’ve spotted changes in didn’t work. It keeps switching between other portraits all around the house.* 

*The most recent one it took possession of is a landscape portrait of a small, old fashioned neighborhood from the 1930s. Something is staring out at me through one window, no more than a hazy blur in the greyness of the glass. I took it down and put it away with the other ones.* 

*-*

The following entries described how it moved from one image to another. Tom subsequently developed a phobia of being around portraits and avoided them religiously, going as far as to lock every painting he owned away in his basement. 

His entries became less and less coherent. He discussed how his world was falling apart. The account he wrote painted a sad picture of a depressed and lonely man who needed help but didn’t know how or where to get it.   

I could hardly make sense of the last couple entries. They read like the ramblings of a madman. I wasn’t surprised since Gilbert told me he had been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses in the years leading up to his death.  

Tom scoured his house repeatedly looking for paintings. He claimed to discover different pictures hanging off of his walls every couple of weeks. It became a daily ritual to check his house to make sure no new ones had appeared. He was convinced something awful would happen if the wraith (as he had begun calling it) was left outside of his basement for too long. 

This was where the readable part of the journal ended. The remaining entries were impossible to make sense of. 

I took the journal upstairs and sorted through the paintings. They were the same ones the author described. 

The one at the bottom of the pile was a depiction of a procession of gaunt soldiers from what looked to be WW2, trudging over the remains of a weathered battleground. The soldier’s eyes were fearful and haunted, their faces stark white. 

This photo scared me in an inexplicable way. The longer I looked at it the more mad and deranged the faces of the soldiers appeared. The sensation I felt while around it mirrored the one the author had described - a steadily growing sense of uneasiness which made it difficult to gaze upon the painting for too long. 

One of the first things I did with the portrait was take a photo of it on my phone. Tom had done the same thing a couple of times previously and made a dubious claim. According to him, the effects the portrait had on him didn’t extend to photos of it, no matter how many he took. 

He was right. The portrait looked distinctly different on camera. The faces of the soldiers appeared more grim rather than haunted and the one furthest to the back of the procession wasn’t grinning in a deranged way the way he was in the original picture. 

I took a couple more photographs, still not quite able to believe it, but they all showed the same thing. 

At a housewarming party I showed the war portrait to some friends. They each shared my discomfort when they looked at it. Some of them didn’t get the feeling of dread I described immediately but one by one they each succumbed to it. 

When I showed them the photos they confirmed the differences I noticed were real. They complimented me on my photo editing skills and I had to explain to them that I didn’t do any of this. When I proved the fact by taking another photograph one of my friends came up with an interesting theory. He suggested a special kind of paint could have been used to make the painting appear different in the light of the camera as a picture was being taken. 

Keen to get to the bottom of the mystery, I began testing some of the other claims made by Tom in his diary. I placed the WW2 portrait next to a collection of creepy photos I’d found online and printed out.

The first time it happened was with a photo of a pale, angular face leering out of a dark background. I couldn’t say precisely when it occurred but the wraith took possession of the photo. What had once been a piece of paper with a generic scary image printed on it was now a dark, almost oppressive presence lying on my desk beside me. 

Something else happened, too. The WW2 portrait changed subtly. The soldiers' faces now looked like they did in the photos I took of the portrait. It worked just as Tom had described in his journal. 

Linked with this post are two of the images it attached itself to. The following picture is the second one the wraith found its way into as a result of my experimentation with it. 

Whenever I wasn’t looking directly at the second photo I could swear the face had turned around to stare at me directly. I frequently looked to check this wasn’t the case but this did little to curb my anxiety.

The effect of the photos seemed to be cumulative over time, the longer the wraith inhabited one photograph. It began as a persistent and intrusive feeling of uneasiness. The longer I spent around the photographs the more they troubled me. The white, angular face began showing up in the corner of my eye. I began to understand why Tom spoke of the portraits the way he did and why he hid so many of them away in the basement. 

If I shared the same room as the wraith I couldn’t bring myself to remain turned away from it for too long - or to look at it for too long, either. And I wasn’t the only one who felt that way. My friends all shared the same sentiment. Once we played a game to see who could look at one of the possessed photos for the longest. The best of us lasted nine minutes before shuddering, turning away and leaving the room. 

There were things the wraith could do which Tom never learned about. But I did. All of what I’d seen so far was only the beginning of what the wraith was capable of. 

One rainy day when I was stuck on a class assignment I elected to take a break and went out to get a coffee. When I came back I noticed something looking back at me from my computer screen which hadn’t been there before. 

It didn’t take me long to pick out the subtle differences in the photo on my screen and deduce what had happened. The wraith had transferred itself onto my computer. What I was looking at was a digital copy of the same leering face I showed you earlier. 

No copy I made of the image file replicated the cognitive effects of the possessed image or the visual differences the wraith had made to it. Modifying the image itself didn’t do anything at first. When I changed it too much the wraith abandoned the image and reattached itself to another one in the same folder. 

I put another image into a parent directory, deleted the possessed one and waited for a response. I didn’t have to wait long. The wraith did what I’d predicted it would do, moving to the image in the other directory. 

A couple of days later I managed to get it inside of a gif. The image depicted a girl standing and staring at her reflection. The animated loop was of the reflection leaning forward and beginning to push its face into the other side of the mirror. The wraith added an extra second to the end of the gif showing the reflection melting through the glass on the girl’s side of the mirror while reaching out for her. This difference was disturbing enough on its own, but I could have sworn the gif was changing a little more each time it played on my screen. 

From time to time the gif would pop up on screen unprompted, stuck in its ceaseless repetition. I began to feel a vague sense of dread while using my computer as I feared another occurrence of the wraith flashing up on my screen. It was a stupid thing to be scared of but I struggled to shake the feeling off. 

Recently I’d watched a slasher flick and I decided to see if the wraith would interact with it. 

Like with the other media there were tangible differences in the possessed version of the film. The murder scenes were more graphic and lasted longer. The movie concluded with a ten second shot of the murderer staring into the camera expressionlessly with no music or noise. 

Upon watching the movie for a second time several more scenes played out where various characters stopped, fell silent, and stared into the screen as the murderer had done. 

The movie mutated further each time I watched it. Scenes became glitched and the subtitles turned into an incomprehensible jumble of characters from a language I couldn’t identify.  

After showing the movie to my friends, they were as unable as I was to explain what they saw. They had seen enough to be convinced the wraith was real, even if I wasn’t so sure of the fact myself. However, none of us were scared by the idea - we were fascinated. 

We were debating what it meant when one of them brought up an intriguing suggestion. 

This little group of ours was in the middle of working on a horror game. It was a passion project the five of us - George, me, Nick, Hayden and Matthew - had envisioned during our first year together at college.  

‘The wraith can inhabit all kinds of media,’ George said, leaning in. ‘What if it could inhabit a video game?’

At his urging, I moved the possessed movie file into the game folder on my computer. When this didn’t have an effect, I deleted the file the wraith had possessed. It turned up in an image file again - this time, a texture within the game.

The game we were working on was an exploration of a large, liminal landscape. There was little story or background - just wandering through an eerie world with an atmosphere inspired by titles ranging from the old Silent Hill games to ActiveWorlds. 

Even though little in the game had been tangibly changed, playing it was a totally different experience. There was an unshakable sense something was hidden in the game with us. Something which wasn’t supposed to be there. 

George in particular was blown away by what the game had become. He got it into his head that we had to find a way to put the wraith into all copies of the game. Then we would release the game and everyone would get to experience what we did while playing it. He was certain it would be a massive success if we could achieve this - he went as far as to claim it might end up being one of the most successful indie horror titles of all time. 

I brought up the significant issue with his plan. There could only be a single copy of the haunted game. My friends could only experience the game like I did when they played it on my computer. Streaming or otherwise recording the game couldn’t effectively recapture the effect playing it had. 

He suggested running the game files through a special program to create duplicates of the wraith. Though it seemed like a dubious prospect to me, I agreed to transfer the file onto a USB drive to give to him. He was convinced he could pull it off and his excitement at the idea was contagious. 

For the next couple of months George dedicated himself to development of the game. The work he did during this time was impressive. In one livestream he toured us through a life sized sports stadium and a fully furnished shopping mall. 

He wanted the experience of the game to be unique for everyone who played it. For this, he had decided to make the world procedurally generated. It was an overly ambitious goal but George was adamant he could pull it off and he already had the code to prove it. 

The progress he’d made was great but it wasn’t what we cared about. We wanted to hear about what he’d done with the wraith.

George admitted he was struggling to control the thing. It was skipping through files in the game too fast for him to keep track of. He assured us he would get on top of the issue and fulfill his promise. We just needed to be patient. 

George was a binge worker. He was typically either procrastinating or feverishly working on something. We were used to seeing him worn out after staying up late completing an assignment the night before it was due. I bring this up to explain why we weren’t initially concerned when we noticed the way George looked during classes. 

We did get a bit worried when he started skipping classes and missed a pair of exams. That concern evolved into worry when Nick overheard he’d bailed out on a family reunion. 

We reached out to him. He admitted his insomnia had come back. He tried to play it all off like it wasn’t a big deal and promised us he intended to see a doctor. Two weeks later, George shared with us another milestone in the game's development. The stalker was a new idea George had added into the game. It would come out after a certain amount of time had elapsed in-game. 

The stalker was supposed to be a physical manifestation of the feeling of something hidden just behind every corner and lurking beyond the walls of fog that the wraith elicited.  

We were a little peeved he’d updated the game in such a major way without consulting with any of us. We might have argued about it, however George was the lead developer of the game and currently the only one working on it at the time. 

Over the course of the two hour livestream he wandered the empty landscapes of the game searching for the stalker and we sat watching him. 

For the first thirty minutes he traversed a metropolis full of stone-still figures staring out of windows from buildings rising unnaturally far into the sky. He wandered around a town square with an oversized, circular fountain where every building was obscured by a dense layer of stagnant mist. 

The creepy atmosphere of the game was offset by banter between us as we watched him play. Yet there was only so long we could fill the void of silence as George roamed restlessly around the empty world. He remained uncomfortably quiet, hardly responding to our attempts to start a conversation, and he became more irritable each time we tried to talk to him. 

*I think I see it,* George announced over the livestream suddenly. 

I didn’t see anything. Neither did any of the other viewers who were still tuned in. 

His avatar had stopped and was staring off toward the slope of a hill upon which a single lonely skyscraper rose into the sky. 

His next comment came after another minute of silence. 

*I keep walking toward this thing but it doesn't seem like I’m getting any closer.* 

*It has turned around, I think.* 

His avatar wasn’t moving at all. He hadn’t moved since he claimed to have seen the stalker. 

There was another pause. 

*You see it, don’t you?*

We all agreed that we could see nothing. 

*I see its face.*

*Bloody hell, there’s something wrong with it, It’s-*  

The livestream continued for a while with George’s avatar staring off into the depths of the grey gloom. We didn’t hear another word from him.

After a full day of no contact from George I went over to his place to check on him in person. 

George laughed his behavior off, telling me he’d felt a little sick and decided to take a break. 

He refused to acknowledge how strangely he’d been acting during the livestream. He couldn’t remember seeing the stalker at all and he couldn’t remember how the livestream ended. 

Following this incident George began to deteriorate more rapidly. His insomnia got worse. You could see signs of it whenever he bothered attending class. He started nodding off frequently. He was always staring off into space with a dull look in his eyes, hardly acknowledging the world going on around him.

George had started a blog a year prior as a game dev diary to keep the small community of fans the game had attracted up to date on its progress. By that time it had become the main way he communicated with the outside world.

\-

*I’m sorry for all the delays in releasing the alpha. Development has been complicated by bugs and some other personal issues going on in my life.* 

*-*

*-*

*A lot of you have been asking, who is the Stalker? I’ve been thinking about this a lot recently. Deliberating over whether it’s better to leave it a mystery for the player to imagine or if I should give a backstory to uncover as they explore. I would appreciate your input on this.* 

*-*

*-*

*I’m hoping to release an update to the demo to show off some of the new stuff I’ve patched in. I’m looking for playtesters.* 

*Tell me you hate the game if you want - I just want to hear some honest input from people.* 

*-*

*-*

*I had a dream last night. In the dream I was wandering around in circles inside a city. It soon dawned on me that I was stuck inside the game.* 

*The stalker was there. It took off its face as if it were some kind of mask. What I saw after that frightened me enough to run like hell away from it. I wish I could tell you what it was I saw but all I can recall is a haze.* 

*I kept running until I couldn't anymore. When I stopped and checked behind me the stalker was gone.* 

*Then somehow I was back where I began my journey. I started to walk again for whatever reason. As is the case many times in dreams I was unable to control my own actions.* 

*Later I found myself at the tall building where I first saw the stalker and the events of the dream repeated themselves. I was confronted with the entity again. It took off its face and I saw what lay beneath. And I ran in terror.* 

*This cycle repeated over and over. Each time the entity revealed itself as something horrifying, though once again, I can’t remember its appearance. I couldn’t tell you if it had a different face each time or the same one.* 

*The dream lasted an uncomfortably long time. It was longer than any other dream I’ve ever had. When I woke up from it I felt as exhausted as if I had spent the whole night awake.*   

*-*

*-*

*I have these dreams every night. They last so long and they seem too real. When I wake up from them I feel as if I haven’t slept at all.* 

*I find it increasingly difficult to focus during the day and I’ve become accustomed to feeling maddeningly tired all the time. I didn’t know it was possible to want to sleep so badly and yet find it so bloody hard to get any proper rest.* 

*The sleeping pills aren’t working anymore. I take them anyway. I’m very dependent on them and I don’t have the energy to deal with the side effects of quitting. At least they make me feel a little less crappy for a while.* 

*-*

Weeks passed before another update was made. I think there were a pair of deleted posts written during the period but I couldn’t recover them. 

Here is the last thing he ever posted:

*-*

*Hi everyone*

*I need to focus on my mental health for a while. I will be pausing work on game development for now.* 

*I’m sorry for all of you who expected a release soon. I can't say when an alpha is going to arrive - or if I’m ever going to pick up this game again, to be honest.* 

*For anyone still tuned in, this is goodbye. For now.* 

*-*

We’d had a talk with him and finally gotten George to understand how seriously he needed help. He’d been persuaded to speak to a new doctor about his sleep issues and he came back with a new prescription. He also acknowledged how obsessed he had become with the game and agreed to take a break from working on it. He was still in a bad state but he’d taken the first steps in getting his life back together. 

I made a mistake then, though I didn’t realize it at the time. I allowed George to keep the possessed copy of the game. As long as the wraith remained in his life, its grip on his mind would never loosen. Not understanding that truth cost George everything. 

A couple of days after our last exchange George was found dead in his apartment. 

It was a seizure, the doctors said. The seizure caused apnea, which was what caused his sudden death. 

The scene must have been traumatizing for his mother who discovered him in his apartment. 

When she’d found him he was lying on the floor. The room was dark except for the flickering light of his computer. It was locked on the game world. George was spread eagled, his face turned to the side and one of his arms was dislocated. 

It felt like so little time ago that I was hanging out at George’s place with a pile of pizzas and some drinks and we were laughing at some silly game he’d created over the weekend for a game jam. The George I remembered was a totally different person from the haggard and mottled skeleton of a person we saw at the funeral. 

The game was abandoned. After a couple months passed we began working on a new project together but without George there to guide and motivate us it lacked the passion and drive it needed to get anywhere. Soon enough we abandoned it too. 

As for the wraith, it sat untouched within an unidentified file on George's computer for a while. His home remained undisturbed for close to a year. 

George’s mother eventually decided to clean up the apartment. She asked us if there was anything of his we wanted to keep. After some deliberation, I agreed to be the one to go back there to retrieve his computer containing the possessed copy of the game. 

My friends and I replayed the game to make sure the wraith hadn’t moved again. Once we agreed that it was still inhabiting the game we deliberated on what to do with it. 

We decided we couldn’t dispose of the computer. The wraith would transfer itself to another conduit and with the new item it would prey on someone else - perhaps another one of us.

After some debate we agreed to have it sealed away instead. We hoped it might remain inactive if it was isolated from people as it had been before I moved into the house. 

Nick rented out a storage unit. We locked the hard drive of the computer in a safebox and we left it there. We hoped to never have to lay eyes on it again. 

For a couple of years our plan actually worked. Nothing could replace the piece of our lives the wraith had stolen but at least now we knew it wouldn’t hurt anyone else. 

Things were complicated when the storage space was robbed. Nothing was stolen from the unit we’d rented but the one next door was completely trashed. Nick elected to move the safebox and its contents to a new, more secure location. Just in case, he said. 

Somewhere along the journey moving it I believe the wraith abandoned the hard drive and attached itself to something in Nick’s car. From there, it followed him home and silently slipped into his life. We didn’t figure out this had happened until much later. 

Since graduating college Nick had become a successful voice actor. He found roles in some video games and a couple of minor tv shows. 

Nick was also an aspiring ventriloquist, something he picked up from his father. His father had been a semi popular ventriloquist during his time and Nick liked to talk about continuing his legacy. 

It should be noted Nick had never been great at ventriloquism. He was convinced he was good at it but he really wasn’t. He loved doing acts onstage but very few could sit through the performances and feel entertained the way he entertained himself. He had a very off brand kind of humor that only he seemed to understand and he didn’t take criticism of his acts very well. 

The fact was Nick was a great voice actor and he had the technique down perfectly for making the dummy appear as if it were talking. But he just couldn’t put together an interesting script and that ruined his performances. 

Everything changed when the wraith returned in its newest form a couple months later. Nick introduced his audiences to Tommy, the ventriloquist dummy he claimed to have discovered stashed away inside the depths of his basement. 

Nick played the role of a submissive character to the dummy, who subjected him to sharing with the audience embarrassing and controversial stories of their years spent together. 

It was a new kind of act and quite different from the material he relied on previously, and it worked out great. The new content was engaging and funny and it stood him out from his competitors. In a couple of weeks he had gone from being a local bar performer to a local sensation. 

I knew the first time I saw him perform with Tommy in person that something was wrong with the dummy. 

I wasn’t the only one who felt that way, either. My friends shared my suspicions. 

My fear was all but confirmed after we visited Nick in person after one show. When I looked into the dummy’s dead, white eyes I sensed something staring back at me. I felt the same way I did when I played our unfinished game and the way I felt being around the possessed portraits.

Nick patiently explained that we were silly to be worried about him. The dummy wasn’t possessed or haunted, he said with a chuckle. He’d convinced himself everything that happened with George was a result of a mental health crisis and the wraith never really existed in the first place. 

The more we pushed him, the more irritable he became. He laughed at us. He called us crazy and claimed we were jealous of his success. He told us we were all pathetic and then threatened to stop speaking to us if we didn’t drop the issue. 

We were still arguing with one another about how to get him to see sense when an unexpected opportunity presented itself. A few weeks later, Nick asked me to review a new act he was working on. I was the only one on good terms with him at the time but I managed to convince Nick to allow his friends to come over so they could apologize to him in person for the previous fight. 

The three of us had agreed to try something more radical. When we came over to visit, Matthew and Hayden. Once they’d both convinced Nick of their remorse we asked to see his newest act and he settled in to show it to us. The moment he got the dummy out, we sprung into action. 

His reaction was comical. He refused to give up on his act as we tried to snatch Tommy out of his hands. The dummy begged him for help as we tried to wrestle it away from him. It started laughing as he chased us through the house, its jaw swinging up and down as Nick ran after us. Nick was making the hysterical laughing sound and yet simultaneously wore a completely horrified expression on his face. 

Once we’d made our escape we smashed it into pieces with a hammer and threw the remains into the trash. 

The very next day Nick was back on stage with the same dummy, which didn’t have a scratch on it, acting like nothing had happened. He refused to speak to any of us again after that. 

We returned to researching the origins of the entity hoping to find a way to get rid of the source of our problems. I won’t get into this much because it was a futile exercise. When we asked for help online the responses we got ranged from disbelieving to making fun of us. We talked to two people who claimed they could help us but they both turned out to be trolls. That was about the extent of it. 

The wraith was manipulating Nick, I suspected. It gave him a taste of fame and success like he’d never experienced before and got him drunk on it. He quickly became dependent on the dummy since he couldn’t perform without it. 

Over time, Nick’s performances became increasingly disturbing and provocative. I continued to see them sporadically after our fallout, still convinced I could somehow get through to him. They were difficult to sit through. 

He knew certain things about the audience, who he frequently interacted with. The interactions he shared with people left many uncomfortable or offended. Others were entertained by his uncanny abilities and provocative personality. I saw people who were in hysterics after watching his performances and talked to others who were religious, fanatic fans of his. 

As its grip over his mind tightened, Nick began to talk to the dummy outside of shows. This was first spotted by his family but it became obvious to everyone else around him in time. He had begun taking it with him wherever he went. Near the end his brother claimed he never saw Nick without Tommy latched onto him. It had become his permanent companion. A part of him. 

This behavior didn’t do wonders for his reputation but by then he had accumulated a loyal band of followers who didn’t care how eccentric and messed up he acted. The wraith gave him the success he'd dreamed of since he was a child but it did so at an unspeakable price. 

As for what happened to Nick, we never figured out a way to help him. The last place he was ever seen was somewhere strange called the Grand Circus of Mysteries. He worked there for a while as one of the star performers before inexplicably disappearing off the face of the earth following a particularly disturbed act. The dummy left with him, but I had no doubt the thing living inside it was still lurking out there somewhere. 

I lost track of the entity for a while after it had finished with Nick. I assumed it had gone on to haunt somebody else's life. Personally I wanted nothing more to do with it. 

My remaining moved out of town and I soon lost contact with them. I think we all felt responsible for failing Nick and we saw each other as reminders of this failure. It was better for all of us if we put the past behind us and moved on with our separate lives. 

I was watching the news one day some years later. The anchor began discussing a sinkhole which had appeared in a stretch of desolate plains outside of my hometown. They described it as a black hole in the ground which sucked in all the light from around it. 

I visited the place in person a couple days later. By then half the people in town had gone over to take a look. 

I approached close enough to lean over and look down into the depths of the cave. When I gazed into the abyss I felt something deep within staring back up at me. 

There I fell into a kind of daze. I felt as if I were falling into the blackness. The world around me became unreal and distant. 

My wife who’d gone out there with me claimed I stood over the hole for over a minute, swaying slightly as I stared down into it. 

It was her who broke me out of my trance. She had to slap me several times before I returned to my senses. By then, I was leaning over far enough that she swore I was about to fall in. 

I’ve been keeping track of the sinkhole since I visited it. I heard a group of kids dared someone to venture inside shortly after I went there. Jeff, I believe his name was. 

He reappeared a couple of days later with no recollection of having gone missing. 

I saw an older version of this boy in the news the other day, nearly ten years later. After I heard about what he did I figured it was time for me to finally get this story out there. 

I’m guessing the wraith has moved on from him by now. Perhaps it returned to the sinkhole, or maybe it has attached itself to a new conduit. Wherever it is, I don’t doubt it is searching for another victim.

1iumvjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1iumvjb/something_nameless_lived_within_my_paintings/,Something Nameless Lived Within My Paintings,"‘Tom went mad,’ Gilbert said. ‘Schizophrenia or something, I think. He stopped leaving the place completely. After a month of being pent up inside he died of starvation.’ 

‘He was a hoarder. A serious one. It took weeks to get the home cleaned up, and even then there’s still some junk in the basement the cleaners left there. I’d be curious to have a look and see if there’s anything valuable.’ He snorted. ‘I doubt it though.’ 

I sorted through what remained of the clutter and determined most of it to be worthless. There were shelves full of dusty tools and stacks of used furniture. Shoved up against the wall was a large mattress with dirty, stained sheets and old clothes piled on top of it. 

There was one thing I uncovered which did catch my attention. In the far back corner of the basement something was hidden underneath a white sheet: a chest, turned back to face the wall. Within the chest I discovered a diary and a stack of paintings.. 

I skimmed through the diary first. Below I’ve copied out some of the stranger entries as I read them:

\-

*I had one of the oddest experiences of my life today.* 

*It started with a dream. From what I could recall I was fleeing from something. I don’t remember what it looked like. I know it was huge - on a cosmic scale. And it wasn’t supposed to exist. I’m not sure if that makes sense but describing the thing at all is difficult for me.* 

*I woke up from the dream with my head throbbing and sweat covering my body. My throat was dry and raw. My ears were ringing. Something felt wrong.* 

*When I went outside the following morning what I saw was bizarre. It looked like a bolt of lightning had struck the ground at the edge of the stretch of hayfields extending past my backyard. The immediate section of corn was blackened and withered, the corn further out a sickly brown color.* 

*In the center of the circle of scorched earth sat a hand sized stone totem. Four uncanny faces decorated each of its sides. They appeared almost but not quite human. Two were screaming, the other two bore grins which extended unnaturally wide. The piece of stone was stained on one side with a blotch of reddish brown.* 

*-*

The previous homeowner took the totem back to his house and put it in the basement. The next couple of entries deliberated over various other aspects of his life. I was intrigued enough to keep skimming through the diary and my curiosity was soon rewarded. 

\-

*Something happened to one of my paintings. I’m writing this down to help me understand it.* 

*I have owned the painting for years. It has been here since before my parents moved in. It’s the type of thing you live with for such a long time you never really notice it. Yet now every time I sit in the room with it I swear I can feel the painting watching me.* 

*-*

He went on to describe the painting - an old man sitting on a table with a walking stick in one hand, the other holding a pair of spectacles up to his eyes. When he had examined it closer, Tom noticed something about the painting had changed. 

\-

*The man looks different. He looks scared. And there is a long, tall shadow in the shadows behind him, only barely visible, but it's definitely there.* 

*After a couple days I took it off the wall and put it away in the basement. That was when I noticed the idol had fallen off the shelf it had been sitting on. It has shattered into several pieces.* 

*The idol no longer gave off the sense of malice it did when I found it. But that’s not to say the feeling has gone - it hasn’t.* 

*-*



*-*

*I went back down to the basement. I checked on both the remains of the idol and the watercolor painting. I previously described my discomfort being around the portrait of the old man but that instinct is gone now. The painting itself appears normal again. Just an old man staring at the viewer with an expression suggesting him to be deep in thought.* 

*Upstairs I have a couple of other portraits hanging up around my house. One is of a little waterfall in a forest. Now out of the corner of my eye I swear I can see something staring out at me from in between two trees within the painting.* 

*I thought it had to be my imagination but when I succumbed to paranoia and took a closer look I realized it wasn’t. When I peered close enough I caught the shadow of something tall in the trees, hunched over to the side at an odd and unnatural angle.* 

\-



\-

*More of the portraits in my house have been changed. These changes are both subtle and unnerving. What is stranger is that when one painting changes, the others change back. The shadow of the thing inside the waterfall painting has disappeared.* 

*I want to know if what is going on here can be explained rationally. And if it can’t, I want to understand what the hell this thing is haunting me.* 

*-*



*-*

*I’ve thought about it and I believe getting rid of the remains would be wisest. I can’t emphasize enough how uncomfortable it is to share a house with it - the thing possessing my paintings, which must be somehow connected to the fetish.* 

*I hate being around the paintings once they’ve changed. They’re not so bad after they’ve changed back, but whichever painting possesses the visual anomalies feels alive. Not just alive, but hostile. I honestly feel like the thing inside the paintings despises me.* 

*I’m not overly superstitious but I’d be an idiot to deny there was something evil about the idol I discovered out there.* 

*-*



*-*

*Getting rid of the idol didn’t work. Getting rid of all of the paintings I’ve spotted changes in didn’t work. It keeps switching between other portraits all around the house.* 

*The most recent one it took possession of is a landscape portrait of a small, old fashioned neighborhood from the 1930s. Something is staring out at me through one window, no more than a hazy blur in the greyness of the glass. I took it down and put it away with the other ones.* 

*-*

The following entries described how it moved from one image to another. Tom subsequently developed a phobia of being around portraits and avoided them religiously, going as far as to lock every painting he owned away in his basement. 

His entries became less and less coherent. He discussed how his world was falling apart. The account he wrote painted a sad picture of a depressed and lonely man who needed help but didn’t know how or where to get it.   

I could hardly make sense of the last couple entries. They read like the ramblings of a madman. I wasn’t surprised since Gilbert told me he had been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses in the years leading up to his death.  

Tom scoured his house repeatedly looking for paintings. He claimed to discover different pictures hanging off of his walls every couple of weeks. It became a daily ritual to check his house to make sure no new ones had appeared. He was convinced something awful would happen if the wraith (as he had begun calling it) was left outside of his basement for too long. 

This was where the readable part of the journal ended. The remaining entries were impossible to make sense of. 

I took the journal upstairs and sorted through the paintings. They were the same ones the author described. 

The one at the bottom of the pile was a depiction of a procession of gaunt soldiers from what looked to be WW2, trudging over the remains of a weathered battleground. The soldier’s eyes were fearful and haunted, their faces stark white. 

This photo scared me in an inexplicable way. The longer I looked at it the more mad and deranged the faces of the soldiers appeared. The sensation I felt while around it mirrored the one the author had described - a steadily growing sense of uneasiness which made it difficult to gaze upon the painting for too long. 

One of the first things I did with the portrait was take a photo of it on my phone. Tom had done the same thing a couple of times previously and made a dubious claim. According to him, the effects the portrait had on him didn’t extend to photos of it, no matter how many he took. 

He was right. The portrait looked distinctly different on camera. The faces of the soldiers appeared more grim rather than haunted and the one furthest to the back of the procession wasn’t grinning in a deranged way the way he was in the original picture. 

I took a couple more photographs, still not quite able to believe it, but they all showed the same thing. 

At a housewarming party I showed the war portrait to some friends. They each shared my discomfort when they looked at it. Some of them didn’t get the feeling of dread I described immediately but one by one they each succumbed to it. 

When I showed them the photos they confirmed the differences I noticed were real. They complimented me on my photo editing skills and I had to explain to them that I didn’t do any of this. When I proved the fact by taking another photograph one of my friends came up with an interesting theory. He suggested a special kind of paint could have been used to make the painting appear different in the light of the camera as a picture was being taken. 

Keen to get to the bottom of the mystery, I began testing some of the other claims made by Tom in his diary. I placed the WW2 portrait next to a collection of creepy photos I’d found online and printed out.

The first time it happened was with a photo of a pale, angular face leering out of a dark background. I couldn’t say precisely when it occurred but the wraith took possession of the photo. What had once been a piece of paper with a generic scary image printed on it was now a dark, almost oppressive presence lying on my desk beside me. 

Something else happened, too. The WW2 portrait changed subtly. The soldiers' faces now looked like they did in the photos I took of the portrait. It worked just as Tom had described in his journal. 

Linked with this post are two of the images it attached itself to. The following picture is the second one the wraith found its way into as a result of my experimentation with it. 

Whenever I wasn’t looking directly at the second photo I could swear the face had turned around to stare at me directly. I frequently looked to check this wasn’t the case but this did little to curb my anxiety. 

The effect of the photos seemed to be cumulative over time, the longer the wraith inhabited one photograph. It began as a persistent and intrusive feeling of uneasiness. The longer I spent around the photographs the more they troubled me. The white, angular face began showing up in the corner of my eye. I began to understand why Tom spoke of the portraits the way he did and why he hid so many of them away in the basement. 

If I shared the same room as the wraith I couldn’t bring myself to remain turned away from it for too long - or to look at it for too long, either. And I wasn’t the only one who felt that way. My friends all shared the same sentiment. Once we played a game to see who could look at one of the possessed photos for the longest. The best of us lasted nine minutes before shuddering, turning away and leaving the room. 

There were things the wraith could do which Tom never learned about. But I did. All of what I’d seen so far was only the beginning of what the wraith was capable of. 

One rainy day when I was stuck on a class assignment I elected to take a break and went out to get a coffee. When I came back I noticed something looking back at me from my computer screen which hadn’t been there before. 

It didn’t take me long to pick out the subtle differences in the photo on my screen and deduce what had happened. The wraith had transferred itself onto my computer. What I was looking at was a digital copy of the same leering face I showed you earlier. 

No copy I made of the image file replicated the cognitive effects of the possessed image or the visual differences the wraith had made to it. Modifying the image itself didn’t do anything at first. When I changed it too much the wraith abandoned the image and reattached itself to another one in the same folder. 

I put another image into a parent directory, deleted the possessed one and waited for a response. I didn’t have to wait long. The wraith did what I’d predicted it would do, moving to the image in the other directory. 

A couple of days later I managed to get it inside of a gif. The image depicted a girl standing and staring at her reflection. The animated loop was of the reflection leaning forward and beginning to push its face into the other side of the mirror. The wraith added an extra second to the end of the gif showing the reflection melting through the glass on the girl’s side of the mirror while reaching out for her. This difference was disturbing enough on its own, but I could have sworn the gif was changing a little more each time it played on my screen. 

From time to time the gif would pop up on screen unprompted, stuck in its ceaseless repetition. I began to feel a vague sense of dread while using my computer as I feared another occurrence of the wraith flashing up on my screen. It was a stupid thing to be scared of but I struggled to shake the feeling off. 

Recently I’d watched a slasher flick and I decided to see if the wraith would interact with it. 

Like with the other media there were tangible differences in the possessed version of the film. The murder scenes were more graphic and lasted longer. The movie concluded with a ten second shot of the murderer staring into the camera expressionlessly with no music or noise. 

Upon watching the movie for a second time several more scenes played out where various characters stopped, fell silent, and stared into the screen as the murderer had done. 

The movie mutated further each time I watched it. Scenes became glitched and the subtitles turned into an incomprehensible jumble of characters from a language I couldn’t identify.  

After showing the movie to my friends, they were as unable as I was to explain what they saw. They had seen enough to be convinced the wraith was real, even if I wasn’t so sure of the fact myself. However, none of us were scared by the idea - we were fascinated. 

We were debating what it meant when one of them brought up an intriguing suggestion. 

This little group of ours was in the middle of working on a horror game. It was a passion project the five of us - George, me, Nick, Hayden and Matthew - had envisioned during our first year together at college.  

‘The wraith can inhabit all kinds of media,’ George said, leaning in. ‘What if it could inhabit a video game?’

At his urging, I moved the possessed movie file into the game folder on my computer. When this didn’t have an effect, I deleted the file the wraith had possessed. It turned up in an image file again - this time, a texture within the game.

The game we were working on was an exploration of a large, liminal landscape. There was little story or background - just wandering through an eerie world with an atmosphere inspired by titles ranging from the old Silent Hill games to ActiveWorlds. 

Even though little in the game had been tangibly changed, playing it was a totally different experience. There was an unshakable sense something was hidden in the game with us. Something which wasn’t supposed to be there. 

George in particular was blown away by what the game had become. He got it into his head that we had to find a way to put the wraith into all copies of the game. Then we would release the game and everyone would get to experience what we did while playing it. He was certain it would be a massive success if we could achieve this - he went as far as to claim it might end up being one of the most successful indie horror titles of all time. 

I brought up the significant issue with his plan. There could only be a single copy of the haunted game. My friends could only experience the game like I did when they played it on my computer. Streaming or otherwise recording the game couldn’t effectively recapture the effect playing it had. 

He suggested running the game files through a special program to create duplicates of the wraith. Though it seemed like a dubious prospect to me, I agreed to transfer the file onto a USB drive to give to him. He was convinced he could pull it off and his excitement at the idea was contagious. 

For the next couple of months George dedicated himself to development of the game. The work he did during this time was impressive. In one livestream he toured us through a life sized sports stadium and a fully furnished shopping mall. 

He wanted the experience of the game to be unique for everyone who played it. For this, he had decided to make the world procedurally generated. It was an overly ambitious goal but George was adamant he could pull it off and he already had the code to prove it. 

The progress he’d made was great but it wasn’t what we cared about. We wanted to hear about what he’d done with the wraith.

George admitted he was struggling to control the thing. It was skipping through files in the game too fast for him to keep track of. He assured us he would get on top of the issue and fulfill his promise. We just needed to be patient. 

George was a binge worker. He was typically either procrastinating or feverishly working on something. We were used to seeing him worn out after staying up late completing an assignment the night before it was due. I bring this up to explain why we weren’t initially concerned when we noticed the way George looked during classes. 

We did get a bit worried when he started skipping classes and missed a pair of exams. That concern evolved into worry when Nick overheard he’d bailed out on a family reunion. 

We reached out to him. He admitted his insomnia had come back. He tried to play it all off like it wasn’t a big deal and promised us he intended to see a doctor. Two weeks later, George shared with us another milestone in the game's development. The stalker was a new idea George had added into the game. It would come out after a certain amount of time had elapsed in-game. 

The stalker was supposed to be a physical manifestation of the feeling of something hidden just behind every corner and lurking beyond the walls of fog that the wraith elicited.  

We were a little peeved he’d updated the game in such a major way without consulting with any of us. We might have argued about it, however George was the lead developer of the game and currently the only one working on it at the time. 

Over the course of the two hour livestream he wandered the empty landscapes of the game searching for the stalker and we sat watching him. 

For the first thirty minutes he traversed a metropolis full of stone-still figures staring out of windows from buildings rising unnaturally far into the sky. He wandered around a town square with an oversized, circular fountain where every building was obscured by a dense layer of stagnant mist. 

The creepy atmosphere of the game was offset by banter between us as we watched him play. Yet there was only so long we could fill the void of silence as George roamed restlessly around the empty world. He remained uncomfortably quiet, hardly responding to our attempts to start a conversation, and he became more irritable each time we tried to talk to him. 

*I think I see it,* George announced over the livestream suddenly. 

I didn’t see anything. Neither did any of the other viewers who were still tuned in. 

His avatar had stopped and was staring off toward the slope of a hill upon which a single lonely skyscraper rose into the sky. 

His next comment came after another minute of silence. 

*I keep walking toward this thing but it doesn't seem like I’m getting any closer.* 

*It has turned around, I think.* 

His avatar wasn’t moving at all. He hadn’t moved since he claimed to have seen the stalker. 

There was another pause. 

*You see it, don’t you?*

We all agreed that we could see nothing. 

*I see its face.*

*Bloody hell, there’s something wrong with it, It’s-*  

The livestream continued for a while with George’s avatar staring off into the depths of the grey gloom. We didn’t hear another word from him.

After a full day of no contact from George I went over to his place to check on him in person. 

George laughed his behavior off, telling me he’d felt a little sick and decided to take a break. 

He refused to acknowledge how strangely he’d been acting during the livestream. He couldn’t remember seeing the stalker at all and he couldn’t remember how the livestream ended. 

Following this incident George began to deteriorate more rapidly. His insomnia got worse. You could see signs of it whenever he bothered attending class. He started nodding off frequently. He was always staring off into space with a dull look in his eyes, hardly acknowledging the world going on around him.

George had started a blog a year prior as a game dev diary to keep the small community of fans the game had attracted up to date on its progress. By that time it had become the main way he communicated with the outside world.

*I’m sorry for all the delays in releasing the alpha. Development has been complicated by bugs and some other personal issues going on in my life.* 

*-*



*-*

*A lot of you have been asking, who is the Stalker? I’ve been thinking about this a lot recently. Deliberating over whether it’s better to leave it a mystery for the player to imagine or if I should give a backstory to uncover as they explore. I would appreciate your input on this.* 

*-*



*-*

*I’m hoping to release an update to the demo to show off some of the new stuff I’ve patched in. I’m looking for playtesters.* 

*Tell me you hate the game if you want - I just want to hear some honest input from people.* 

*-*



*-*

*I had a dream last night. In the dream I was wandering around in circles inside a city. It soon dawned on me that I was stuck inside the game.* 

*The stalker was there. It took off its face as if it were some kind of mask. What I saw after that frightened me enough to run like hell away from it. I wish I could tell you what it was I saw but all I can recall is a haze.* 

*I kept running until I couldn't anymore. When I stopped and checked behind me the stalker was gone.* 

*Then somehow I was back where I began my journey. I started to walk again for whatever reason. As is the case many times in dreams I was unable to control my own actions.* 

*Later I found myself at the tall building where I first saw the stalker and the events of the dream repeated themselves. I was confronted with the entity again. It took off its face and I saw what lay beneath. And I ran in terror.* 

*This cycle repeated over and over. Each time the entity revealed itself as something horrifying, though once again, I can’t remember its appearance. I couldn’t tell you if it had a different face each time or the same one.* 

*The dream lasted an uncomfortably long time. It was longer than any other dream I’ve ever had. When I woke up from it I felt as exhausted as if I had spent the whole night awake.*   

*-*



*-*

*I have these dreams every night. They last so long and they seem too real. When I wake up from them I feel as if I haven’t slept at all.* 

*I find it increasingly difficult to focus during the day and I’ve become accustomed to feeling maddeningly tired all the time. I didn’t know it was possible to want to sleep so badly and yet find it so bloody hard to get any proper rest.* 

*The sleeping pills aren’t working anymore. I take them anyway. I’m very dependent on them and I don’t have the energy to deal with the side effects of quitting. At least they make me feel a little less crappy for a while.* 

*-*

Weeks passed before another update was made. I think there were a pair of deleted posts written during the period but I couldn’t recover them. 

Here is the last thing he ever posted:

*-*

*Hi everyone*

*I need to focus on my mental health for a while. I will be pausing work on game development for now.* 

*I’m sorry for all of you who expected a release soon. I can't say when an alpha is going to arrive - or if I’m ever going to pick up this game again, to be honest.* 

*For anyone still tuned in, this is goodbye. For now.* 

*-*

We’d had a talk with him and finally gotten George to understand how seriously he needed help. He’d been persuaded to speak to a new doctor about his sleep issues and he came back with a new prescription. He also acknowledged how obsessed he had become with the game and agreed to take a break from working on it. He was still in a bad state but he’d taken the first steps in getting his life back together. 

I made a mistake then, though I didn’t realize it at the time. I allowed George to keep the possessed copy of the game. As long as the wraith remained in his life, its grip on his mind would never loosen. Not understanding that truth cost George everything. 

A couple of days after our last exchange George was found dead in his apartment. 

It was a seizure, the doctors said. The seizure caused apnea, which was what caused his sudden death. 

The scene must have been traumatizing for his mother who discovered him in his apartment. 

When she’d found him he was lying on the floor. The room was dark except for the flickering light of his computer. It was locked on the game world. George was spread eagled, his face turned to the side and one of his arms was dislocated. 

It felt like so little time ago that I was hanging out at George’s place with a pile of pizzas and some drinks and we were laughing at some silly game he’d created over the weekend for a game jam. The George I remembered was a totally different person from the haggard and mottled skeleton of a person we saw at the funeral. 

The game was abandoned. After a couple months passed we began working on a new project together but without George there to guide and motivate us it lacked the passion and drive it needed to get anywhere. Soon enough we abandoned it too. 

As for the wraith, it sat untouched within an unidentified file on George's computer for a while. His home remained undisturbed for close to a year. 

George’s mother eventually decided to clean up the apartment. She asked us if there was anything of his we wanted to keep. After some deliberation, I agreed to be the one to go back there to retrieve his computer containing the possessed copy of the game. 

My friends and I replayed the game to make sure the wraith hadn’t moved again. Once we agreed that it was still inhabiting the game we deliberated on what to do with it. 

We decided we couldn’t dispose of the computer. The wraith would transfer itself to another conduit and with the new item it would prey on someone else - perhaps another one of us.

After some debate we agreed to have it sealed away instead. We hoped it might remain inactive if it was isolated from people as it had been before I moved into the house. 

Nick rented out a storage unit. We locked the hard drive of the computer in a safebox and we left it there. We hoped to never have to lay eyes on it again. 

For a couple of years our plan actually worked. Nothing could replace the piece of our lives the wraith had stolen but at least now we knew it wouldn’t hurt anyone else. 

Things were complicated when the storage space was robbed. Nothing was stolen from the unit we’d rented but the one next door was completely trashed. Nick elected to move the safebox and its contents to a new, more secure location. Just in case, he said. 

Somewhere along the journey moving it I believe the wraith abandoned the hard drive and attached itself to something in Nick’s car. From there, it followed him home and silently slipped into his life. We didn’t figure out this had happened until much later. 

Since graduating college Nick had become a successful voice actor. He found roles in some video games and a couple of minor tv shows. 

Nick was also an aspiring ventriloquist, something he picked up from his father. His father had been a semi popular ventriloquist during his time and Nick liked to talk about continuing his legacy. 

It should be noted Nick had never been great at ventriloquism. He was convinced he was good at it but he really wasn’t. He loved doing acts onstage but very few could sit through the performances and feel entertained the way he entertained himself. He had a very off brand kind of humor that only he seemed to understand and he didn’t take criticism of his acts very well. 

The fact was Nick was a great voice actor and he had the technique down perfectly for making the dummy appear as if it were talking. But he just couldn’t put together an interesting script and that ruined his performances. 

Everything changed when the wraith returned in its newest form a couple months later. Nick introduced his audiences to Tommy, the ventriloquist dummy he claimed to have discovered stashed away inside the depths of his basement. 

Nick played the role of a submissive character to the dummy, who subjected him to sharing with the audience embarrassing and controversial stories of their years spent together. 

It was a new kind of act and quite different from the material he relied on previously, and it worked out great. The new content was engaging and funny and it stood him out from his competitors. In a couple of weeks he had gone from being a local bar performer to a local sensation. 

I knew the first time I saw him perform with Tommy in person that something was wrong with the dummy. 

I wasn’t the only one who felt that way, either. My friends shared my suspicions. 

My fear was all but confirmed after we visited Nick in person after one show. When I looked into the dummy’s dead, white eyes I sensed something staring back at me. I felt the same way I did when I played our unfinished game and the way I felt being around the possessed portraits.

Nick patiently explained that we were silly to be worried about him. The dummy wasn’t possessed or haunted, he said with a chuckle. He’d convinced himself everything that happened with George was a result of a mental health crisis and the wraith never really existed in the first place. 

The more we pushed him, the more irritable he became. He laughed at us. He called us crazy and claimed we were jealous of his success. He told us we were all pathetic and then threatened to stop speaking to us if we didn’t drop the issue. 

We were still arguing with one another about how to get him to see sense when an unexpected opportunity presented itself. A few weeks later, Nick asked me to review a new act he was working on. I was the only one on good terms with him at the time but I managed to convince Nick to allow his friends to come over so they could apologize to him in person for the previous fight. 

The three of us had agreed to try something more radical. When we came over to visit, Matthew and Hayden. Once they’d both convinced Nick of their remorse we asked to see his newest act and he settled in to show it to us. The moment he got the dummy out, we sprung into action. 

His reaction was comical. He refused to give up on his act as we tried to snatch Tommy out of his hands. The dummy begged him for help as we tried to wrestle it away from him. It started laughing as he chased us through the house, its jaw swinging up and down as Nick ran after us. Nick was making the hysterical laughing sound and yet simultaneously wore a completely horrified expression on his face. 

Once we’d made our escape we smashed it into pieces with a hammer and threw the remains into the trash. 

The very next day Nick was back on stage with the same dummy, which didn’t have a scratch on it, acting like nothing had happened. He refused to speak to any of us again after that. 

We returned to researching the origins of the entity hoping to find a way to get rid of the source of our problems. I won’t get into this much because it was a futile exercise. When we asked for help online the responses we got ranged from disbelieving to making fun of us. We talked to two people who claimed they could help us but they both turned out to be trolls. That was about the extent of it. 

The wraith was manipulating Nick, I suspected. It gave him a taste of fame and success like he’d never experienced before and got him drunk on it. He quickly became dependent on the dummy since he couldn’t perform without it. 

Over time, Nick’s performances became increasingly disturbing and provocative. I continued to see them sporadically after our fallout, still convinced I could somehow get through to him. They were difficult to sit through. 

He knew certain things about the audience, who he frequently interacted with. The interactions he shared with people left many uncomfortable or offended. Others were entertained by his uncanny abilities and provocative personality. I saw people who were in hysterics after watching his performances and talked to others who were religious, fanatic fans of his. 

As its grip over his mind tightened, Nick began to talk to the dummy outside of shows. This was first spotted by his family but it became obvious to everyone else around him in time. He had begun taking it with him wherever he went. Near the end his brother claimed he never saw Nick without Tommy latched onto him. It had become his permanent companion. A part of him. 

This behavior didn’t do wonders for his reputation but by then he had accumulated a loyal band of followers who didn’t care how eccentric and messed up he acted. The wraith gave him the success he'd dreamed of since he was a child but it did so at an unspeakable price. 

As for what happened to Nick, we never figured out a way to help him. The last place he was ever seen was somewhere strange called the Grand Circus of Mysteries. He worked there for a while as one of the star performers before inexplicably disappearing off the face of the earth following a particularly disturbed act. The dummy left with him, but I had no doubt the thing living inside it was still lurking out there somewhere. 

I lost track of the entity for a while after it had finished with Nick. I assumed it had gone on to haunt somebody else's life. Personally I wanted nothing more to do with it. 

My remaining moved out of town and I soon lost contact with them. I think we all felt responsible for failing Nick and we saw each other as reminders of this failure. It was better for all of us if we put the past behind us and moved on with our separate lives. 

I was watching the news one day some years later. The anchor began discussing a sinkhole which had appeared in a stretch of desolate plains outside of my hometown. They described it as a black hole in the ground which sucked in all the light from around it. 

I visited the place in person a couple days later. By then half the people in town had gone over to take a look. 

I approached close enough to lean over and look down into the depths of the cave. When I gazed into the abyss I felt something deep within staring back up at me. 

There I fell into a kind of daze. I felt as if I were falling into the blackness. The world around me became unreal and distant. 

My wife who’d gone out there with me claimed I stood over the hole for over a minute, swaying slightly as I stared down into it. 

It was her who broke me out of my trance. She had to slap me several times before I returned to my senses. By then, I was leaning over far enough that she swore I was about to fall in. 

I’ve been keeping track of the sinkhole since I visited it. I heard a group of kids dared someone to venture inside shortly after I went there. Jeff, I believe his name was. 

He reappeared a couple of days later with no recollection of having gone missing. 

I saw an older version of this boy in the news the other day, nearly ten years later. After I heard about what he did I figured it was time for me to finally get this story out there. 

I’m guessing the wraith has moved on from him by now. Perhaps it returned to the sinkhole, or maybe it has attached itself to a new conduit. Wherever it is, I don’t doubt it is searching for another victim. 

Be safe out there. ",2,1740129583.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

He stopped leaving the place completely. After a month of being pent up inside he died of starvation.’ 

‘He was a hoarder. A serious one. It took weeks to get the home cleaned up, and even then there’s still some junk in the basement the cleaners left there. I’d be curious to have a look and see if there’s anything valuable.’ He snorted. ‘I doubt it though.’ 

I sorted through what remained of the clutter and determined most of it to be worthless. There were shelves full of dusty tools and stacks of used furniture. Shoved up against the wall was a large mattress with dirty, stained sheets and old clothes piled on top of it. 

There was one thing I uncovered which did catch my attention. In the far back corner of the basement something was hidden underneath a white sheet: a chest, turned back to face the wall. Within the chest I discovered a diary and a stack of paintings.. 

I skimmed through the diary first. Below I’ve copied out some of the stranger entries as I read them: 

\-

*I had one of the oddest experiences of my life today.* 

*It started with a dream. From what I could recall I was fleeing from something. I don’t remember what it looked like. I know it was huge - on a cosmic scale. And it wasn’t supposed to exist. I’m not sure if that makes sense but describing the thing at all is difficult for me.* 

*I woke up from the dream with my head throbbing and sweat covering my body. My throat was dry and raw. My ears were ringing. Something felt wrong.* 

*When I went outside the following morning what I saw was bizarre. It looked like a bolt of lightning had struck the ground at the edge of the stretch of hayfields extending past my backyard. The immediate section of corn was blackened and withered, the corn further out a sickly brown color.* 

*In the center of the circle of scorched earth sat a hand sized stone totem. Four uncanny faces decorated each of its sides. They appeared almost but not quite human. Two were screaming, the other two bore grins which extended unnaturally wide. The piece of stone was stained on one side with a blotch of reddish brown.* 

*-*

The previous homeowner took the totem back to his house and put it in the basement. The next couple of entries deliberated over various other aspects of his life. I was intrigued enough to keep skimming through the diary and my curiosity was soon rewarded. 

\-

*Something happened to one of my paintings. I’m writing this down to help me understand it.* 

*I have owned the painting for years. It has been here since before my parents moved in. It’s the type of thing you live with for such a long time you never really notice it. Yet now every time I sit in the room with it I swear I can feel the painting watching me.* 

*-*

He went on to describe the painting - an old man sitting on a table with a walking stick in one hand, the other holding a pair of spectacles up to his eyes. When he had examined it closer, Tom noticed something about the painting had changed. 

\-

*The man looks different. He looks scared. And there is a long, tall shadow in the shadows behind him, only barely visible, but it's definitely there.* 

*After a couple days I took it off the wall and put it away in the basement. That was when I noticed the idol had fallen off the shelf it had been sitting on. It has shattered into several pieces.* 

*The idol no longer gave off the sense of malice it did when I found it. But that’s not to say the feeling has gone - it hasn’t.* 

*-*



*-*

*I went back down to the basement. I checked on both the remains of the idol and the watercolor painting. I previously described my discomfort being around the portrait of the old man but that instinct is gone now. The painting itself appears normal again. Just an old man staring at the viewer with an expression suggesting him to be deep in thought.* 

*Upstairs I have a couple of other portraits hanging up around my house. One is of a little waterfall in a forest. Now out of the corner of my eye I swear I can see something staring out at me from in between two trees within the painting.* 

*I thought it had to be my imagination but when I succumbed to paranoia and took a closer look I realized it wasn’t. When I peered close enough I caught the shadow of something tall in the trees, hunched over to the side at an odd and unnatural angle.* 

\-



\-

*More of the portraits in my house have been changed. These changes are both subtle and unnerving. What is stranger is that when one painting changes, the others change back. The shadow of the thing inside the waterfall painting has disappeared.* 

*I want to know if what is going on here can be explained rationally. And if it can’t, I want to understand what the hell this thing is haunting me.* 

*-*



*-*

*I’ve thought about it and I believe getting rid of the remains would be wisest. I can’t emphasize enough how uncomfortable it is to share a house with it - the thing possessing my paintings, which must be somehow connected to the fetish.* 

*I hate being around the paintings once they’ve changed. They’re not so bad after they’ve changed back, but whichever painting possesses the visual anomalies feels alive. Not just alive, but hostile. I honestly feel like the thing inside the paintings despises me.* 

*I’m not overly superstitious but I’d be an idiot to deny there was something evil about the idol I discovered out there.* 

*-*



*-*

*Getting rid of the idol didn’t work. Getting rid of all of the paintings I’ve spotted changes in didn’t work. It keeps switching between other portraits all around the house.* 

*The most recent one it took possession of is a landscape portrait of a small, old fashioned neighbourhood from the 1930s. Something is staring out at me through one window, no more than a hazy blur in the greyness of the glass. I took it down and put it away with the other ones.* 

*-*

The following entries described how it moved from one image to another. Tom subsequently developed a phobia of being around portraits and avoided them religiously, going as far as to lock every painting he owned away in his basement. 

His entries became less and less coherent. He discussed how his world was falling apart. The account he wrote painted a sad picture of a depressed and lonely man who needed help but didn’t know how or where to get it.   

I could hardly make sense of the last couple entries. They read like the ramblings of a madman. I wasn’t surprised since Gilbert told me he had been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses in the years leading up to his death.  

Tom scoured his house repeatedly looking for paintings. He claimed to discover different pictures hanging off of his walls every couple of weeks. It became a daily ritual to check his house to make sure no new ones had appeared. He was convinced something awful would happen if the wraith (as he had begun calling it) was left outside of his basement for too long. 

This was where the readable part of the journal ended. The remaining entries were impossible to make sense of. 

I took the journal upstairs and sorted through the paintings. They were the same ones the author described. 

The one at the bottom of the pile was a depiction of a procession of gaunt soldiers from what looked to be WW2, trudging over the remains of a weathered battleground. The soldier’s eyes were fearful and haunted, their faces stark white. 

This photo scared me in an inexplicable way. The longer I looked at it the more mad and deranged the faces of the soldiers appeared. The sensation I felt while around it mirrored the one the author had described - a steadily growing sense of uneasiness which made it difficult to gaze upon the painting for too long. 

One of the first things I did with the portrait was take a photo of it on my phone. Tom had done the same thing a couple of times previously and made a dubious claim. According to him, the effects the portrait had on him didn’t extend to photos of it, no matter how many he took. 

He was right. The portrait looked distinctly different on camera. The faces of the soldiers appeared more grim rather than haunted and the one furthest to the back of the procession wasn’t grinning in a deranged way the way he was in the original picture. 

I took a couple more photographs, still not quite able to believe it, but they all showed the same thing. 

At a housewarming party I showed the war portrait to some friends. They each shared my discomfort when they looked at it. Some of them didn’t get the feeling of dread I described immediately but one by one they each succumbed to it. 

When I showed them the photos they confirmed the differences I noticed were real. They complimented me on my photo editing skills and I had to explain to them that I didn’t do any of this. When I proved the fact by taking another photograph one of my friends came up with an interesting theory. He suggested a special kind of paint could have been used to make the painting appear different in the light of the camera as a picture was being taken. 

Keen to get to the bottom of the mystery, I began testing some of the other claims made by Tom in his diary. I placed the WW2 portrait next to a collection of creepy photos I’d found online and printed out.

The first time it happened was with a photo of a pale, angular face leering out of a dark background. I couldn’t say precisely when it occurred but the wraith took possession of the photo. What had once been a piece of paper with a generic scary image printed on it was now a dark, almost oppressive presence lying on my desk beside me. 

Something else happened, too. The WW2 portrait changed subtly. The soldiers' faces now looked like they did in the photos I took of the portrait. It worked just as Tom had described in his journal. 

Whenever I wasn’t looking directly at one of the photos I could swear the face in it had turned around to stare at me . I frequently looked to check this wasn’t the case but this did little to curb my anxiety.

The effect of the photos seemed to be cumulative over time, the longer the wraith inhabited one photograph. It began as a persistent and intrusive feeling of uneasiness. The longer I spent around the photographs the more they troubled me. The white, angular face began showing up in the corner of my eye. I began to understand why Tom spoke of the portraits the way he did and why he hid so many of them away in the basement. 

If I shared the same room as the wraith I couldn’t bring myself to remain turned away from it for too long - or to look at it for too long, either. And I wasn’t the only one who felt that way. My friends all shared the same sentiment. Once we played a game to see who could look at one of the possessed photos for the longest. The best of us lasted nine minutes before shuddering, turning away and leaving the room. 

There were things the wraith could do which Tom never learned about. But I did. All of what I’d seen so far was only the beginning of what the wraith was capable of. 

One rainy day when I was stuck on a class assignment I elected to take a break and went out to get a coffee. When I came back I noticed something looking back at me from my computer screen which hadn’t been there before. 

It didn’t take me long to pick out the subtle differences in the photo on my screen and deduce what had happened. The wraith had transferred itself onto my computer. What I was looking at was a digital copy of the same leering face I showed you earlier. 

No copy I made of the image file replicated the cognitive effects of the possessed image or the visual differences the wraith had made to it. Modifying the image itself didn’t do anything at first. When I changed it too much the wraith abandoned the image and reattached itself to another one in the same folder. 

I put another image into a parent directory, deleted the possessed one and waited for a response. I didn’t have to wait long. The wraith did what I’d predicted it would do, moving to the image in the other directory. 

A couple of days later I managed to get it inside of a gif. The image depicted a girl standing and staring at her reflection. The animated loop was of the reflection leaning forward and beginning to push its face into the other side of the mirror. The wraith added an extra second to the end of the gif showing the reflection melting through the glass on the girl’s side of the mirror while reaching out for her. This difference was disturbing enough on its own, but I could have sworn the gif was changing a little more each time it played on my screen. 

From time to time the gif would pop up on screen unprompted, stuck in its ceaseless repetition. I began to feel a vague sense of dread while using my computer as I feared another occurrence of the wraith flashing up on my screen. It was a stupid thing to be scared of but I struggled to shake the feeling off. 

Recently I’d watched a slasher flick and I decided to see if the wraith would interact with it. 

Like with the other media there were tangible differences in the possessed version of the film. The murder scenes were more graphic and lasted longer. The movie concluded with a ten second shot of the murderer staring into the camera expressionlessly with no music or noise. 

Upon watching the movie for a second time several more scenes played out where various characters stopped, fell silent, and stared into the screen as the murderer had done. 

The movie mutated further each time I watched it. Scenes became glitched and the subtitles turned into an incomprehensible jumble of characters from a language I couldn’t identify.  

After showing the movie to my friends, they were as unable as I was to explain what they saw. They had seen enough to be convinced the wraith was real, even if I wasn’t so sure of the fact myself. However, none of us were scared by the idea - we were fascinated. 

We were debating what it meant when one of them brought up an intriguing suggestion. 

This little group of ours was in the middle of working on a horror game. It was a passion project the five of us - George, me, Nick, Hayden and Matthew - had envisioned during our first year together at college.  

‘The wraith can inhabit all kinds of media,’ George said, leaning in. ‘What if it could inhabit a video game?’

At his urging, I moved the possessed movie file into the game folder on my computer. When this didn’t have an effect, I deleted the file the wraith had possessed. It turned up in an image file again - this time, a texture within the game.

The game we were working on was an exploration of a large, liminal landscape. There was little story or background - just wandering through an eerie world with an atmosphere inspired by titles ranging from the old Silent Hill games to ActiveWorlds. 

Even though little in the game had been tangibly changed, playing it was a totally different experience. There was an unshakable sense something was hidden in the game with us. Something which wasn’t supposed to be there. 

George in particular was blown away by what the game had become. He got it into his head that we had to find a way to put the wraith into all copies of the game. Then we would release the game and everyone would get to experience what we did while playing it. He was certain it would be a massive success if we could achieve this - he went as far as to claim it might end up being one of the most successful indie horror titles of all time. 

I brought up the significant issue with his plan. There could only be a single copy of the haunted game. My friends could only experience the game like I did when they played it on my computer. Streaming or otherwise recording the game couldn’t effectively recapture the effect playing it had. 

He suggested running the game files through a special program to create duplicates of the wraith. Though it seemed like a dubious prospect to me, I agreed to transfer the file onto a USB drive to give to him. He was convinced he could pull it off and his excitement at the idea was contagious. 

For the next couple of months George dedicated himself to development of the game. The work he did during this time was impressive. In one livestream he toured us through a life sized sports stadium and a fully furnished shopping mall. 

He wanted the experience of the game to be unique for everyone who played it. For this, he had decided to make the world procedurally generated. It was an overly ambitious goal but George was adamant he could pull it off and he already had the code to prove it. 

The progress he’d made was great but it wasn’t what we cared about. We wanted to hear about what he’d done with the wraith.

George admitted he was struggling to control the thing. It was skipping through files in the game too fast for him to keep track of. He assured us he would get on top of the issue and fulfill his promise. We just needed to be patient. 

George was a binge worker. He was typically either procrastinating or feverishly working on something. We were used to seeing him worn out after staying up late completing an assignment the night before it was due. I bring this up to explain why we weren’t initially concerned when we noticed the way George looked during classes. 

We did get a bit worried when he started skipping classes and missed a pair of exams. That concern evolved into worry when Nick overheard he’d bailed out on a family reunion.  

We reached out to him. He admitted his insomnia had come back. He tried to play it all off like it wasn’t a big deal and promised us he intended to see a doctor. Two weeks later, George shared with us another milestone in the game's development. The stalker was a new idea George had added into the game. It would come out after a certain amount of time had elapsed in-game. 

The stalker was supposed to be a physical manifestation of the feeling of something hidden just behind every corner and lurking beyond the walls of fog that the wraith elicited.  

We were a little peeved he’d updated the game in such a major way without consulting with any of us. We might have argued about it, however George was the lead developer of the game and currently the only one working on it at the time. 

Over the course of the two hour livestream he wandered the empty landscapes of the game searching for the stalker and we sat watching him. 

For the first thirty minutes he traversed a metropolis full of stone-still figures staring out of windows from buildings rising unnaturally far into the sky. He wandered around a town square with an oversized, circular fountain where every building was obscured by a dense layer of stagnant mist. 

The creepy atmosphere of the game was offset by banter between us as we watched him play. Yet there was only so long we could fill the void of silence as George roamed restlessly around the empty world. He remained uncomfortably quiet, hardly responding to our attempts to start a conversation, and he became more irritable each time we tried to talk to him. 

*I think I see it,* George announced over the livestream suddenly. 

I didn’t see anything. Neither did any of the other viewers who were still tuned in. 

His avatar had stopped and was staring off toward the slope of a hill upon which a single lonely skyscraper rose into the sky. 

His next comment came after another minute of silence. 

*I keep walking toward this thing but it doesn't seem like I’m getting any closer.* 

*It has turned around, I think.* 

His avatar wasn’t moving at all. He hadn’t moved since he claimed to have seen the stalker. 

There was another pause. 

*You see it, don’t you?*

We all agreed that we could see nothing. 

*I see its face.*

*Bloody hell, there’s something wrong with it, It’s-*  

The livestream continued for a while with George’s avatar staring off into the depths of the grey gloom. We didn’t hear another word from him. 

After a full day of no contact from George I went over to his place to check on him in person. 

George laughed his behavior off, telling me he’d felt a little sick and decided to take a break. 

He refused to acknowledge how strangely he’d been acting during the livestream. He couldn’t remember seeing the stalker at all and he couldn’t remember how the livestream ended. 

Following this incident George began to deteriorate more rapidly. His insomnia got worse. You could see signs of it whenever he bothered attending class. He started nodding off frequently. He was always staring off into space with a dull look in his eyes, hardly acknowledging the world going on around him.

George had started a blog a year prior as a game dev diary to keep the small community of fans the game had attracted up to date on its progress. By that time it had become the main way he communicated with the outside world.

*I’m sorry for all the delays in releasing the alpha. Development has been complicated by bugs and some other personal issues going on in my life.* 

*-* 



*-*

*A lot of you have been asking, who is the Stalker? I’ve been thinking about this a lot recently. Deliberating over whether it’s better to leave it a mystery for the player to imagine or if I should give a backstory to uncover as they explore. I would appreciate your input on this.* 

*-*



*-*

*I’m hoping to release an update to the demo to show off some of the new stuff I’ve patched in. I’m looking for playtesters.* 

*Tell me you hate the game if you want - I just want to hear some honest input from people.* 

*-*



*-*

*I had a dream last night. In the dream I was wandering around in circles inside a city. It soon dawned on me that I was stuck inside the game.* 

*The stalker was there. It took off its face as if it were some kind of mask. What I saw after that frightened me enough to run like hell away from it. I wish I could tell you what it was I saw but all I can recall is a haze.* 

*I kept running until I couldn't anymore. When I stopped and checked behind me the stalker was gone.* 

*Then somehow I was back where I began my journey. I started to walk again for whatever reason. As is the case many times in dreams I was unable to control my own actions.* 

*Later I found myself at the tall building where I first saw the stalker and the events of the dream repeated themselves. I was confronted with the entity again. It took off its face and I saw what lay beneath. And I ran in terror.* 

*This cycle repeated over and over. Each time the entity revealed itself as something horrifying, though once again, I can’t remember its appearance. I couldn’t tell you if it had a different face each time or the same one.* 

*The dream lasted an uncomfortably long time. It was longer than any other dream I’ve ever had. When I woke up from it I felt as exhausted as if I had spent the whole night awake.*   

*-*



*-*

*I have these dreams every night. They last so long and they seem too real. When I wake up from them I feel as if I haven’t slept at all.* 

*I find it increasingly difficult to focus during the day and I’ve become accustomed to feeling maddeningly tired all the time. I didn’t know it was possible to want to sleep so badly and yet find it so bloody hard to get any proper rest.* 

*The sleeping pills aren’t working anymore. I take them anyway. I’m very dependent on them and I don’t have the energy to deal with the side effects of quitting. At least they make me feel a little less crappy for a while.* 

*-*

Weeks passed before another update was made. I think there were a pair of deleted posts written during the period but I couldn’t recover them. 

Here is the last thing he ever posted:

*-*

*Hi everyone*

*I need to focus on my mental health for a while. I will be pausing work on game development for now.* 

*I’m sorry for all of you who expected a release soon. I can't say when an alpha is going to arrive - or if I’m ever going to pick up this game again, to be honest.* 

*For anyone still tuned in, this is goodbye. For now.* 

*-*

We’d had a talk with him and finally gotten George to understand how seriously he needed help. He’d been persuaded to speak to a new doctor about his sleep issues and he came back with a new prescription. He also acknowledged how obsessed he had become with the game and agreed to take a break from working on it. He was still in a bad state but he’d taken the first steps in getting his life back together. 

I made a mistake then, though I didn’t realize it at the time. I allowed George to keep the possessed copy of the game. As long as the wraith remained in his life, its grip on his mind would never loosen. Not understanding that truth cost George everything. 

A couple of days after our last exchange George was found dead in his apartment. 

It was a seizure, the doctors said. The seizure caused apnea, which was what caused his sudden death. 

The scene must have been traumatizing for his mother who discovered him in his apartment. 

When she’d found him he was lying on the floor. The room was dark except for the flickering light of his computer. It was locked on the game world. George was spread eagled, his face turned to the side and one of his arms was dislocated. 

It felt like so little time ago that I was hanging out at George’s place with a pile of pizzas and some drinks and we were laughing at some silly game he’d created over the weekend for a game jam. The George I remembered was a totally different person from the haggard and mottled skeleton of a person we saw at the funeral. 

The game was abandoned. After a couple months passed we began working on a new project together but without George there to guide and motivate us it lacked the passion and drive it needed to get anywhere. Soon enough we abandoned it too. 

As for the wraith, it sat untouched within an unidentified file on George's computer for a while. His home remained undisturbed for close to a year. 

George’s mother eventually decided to clean up the apartment. She asked us if there was anything of his we wanted to keep. After some deliberation, I agreed to be the one to go back there to retrieve his computer containing the possessed copy of the game. 

My friends and I replayed the game to make sure the wraith hadn’t moved again. Once we agreed that it was still inhabiting the game we deliberated on what to do with it. 

We decided we couldn’t dispose of the computer. The wraith would transfer itself to another conduit and with the new item it would prey on someone else - perhaps another one of us.

After some debate we agreed to have it sealed away instead. We hoped it might remain inactive if it was isolated from people as it had been before I moved into the house. 

Nick rented out a storage unit. We locked the hard drive of the computer in a safebox and we left it there. We hoped to never have to lay eyes on it again. 

For a couple of years our plan actually worked. Nothing could replace the piece of our lives the wraith had stolen but at least now we knew it wouldn’t hurt anyone else. 

Things were complicated when the storage space was robbed. Nothing was stolen from the unit we’d rented but the one next door was completely trashed. Nick elected to move the safebox and its contents to a new, more secure location. Just in case, he said. 

Somewhere along the journey moving it I believe the wraith abandoned the hard drive and attached itself to something in Nick’s car. From there, it followed him home and silently slipped into his life. We didn’t figure out this had happened until much later. 

Since graduating college Nick had become a successful voice actor. He found roles in some video games and a couple of minor tv shows. 

Nick was also an aspiring ventriloquist, something he picked up from his father. His father had been a semi popular ventriloquist during his time and Nick liked to talk about continuing his legacy. 

It should be noted Nick had never been great at ventriloquism. He was convinced he was good at it but he really wasn’t. He loved doing acts onstage but very few could sit through the performances and feel entertained the way he entertained himself. He had a very off brand kind of humor that only he seemed to understand and he didn’t take criticism of his acts very well. 

The fact was Nick was a great voice actor and he had the technique down perfectly for making the dummy appear as if it were talking. But he just couldn’t put together an interesting script and that ruined his performances. 

Everything changed when the wraith returned in its newest form a couple months later. Nick introduced his audiences to Tommy, the ventriloquist dummy he claimed to have discovered stashed away inside the depths of his basement. 

Nick played the role of a submissive character to the dummy, who subjected him to sharing with the audience embarrassing and controversial stories of their years spent together. 

It was a new kind of act and quite different from the material he relied on previously, and it worked out great. The new content was engaging and funny and it stood him out from his competitors. In a couple of weeks he had gone from being a local bar performer to a local sensation. 

I knew the first time I saw him perform with Tommy in person that something was wrong with the dummy. 

I wasn’t the only one who felt that way, either. My friends shared my suspicions. 

My fear was all but confirmed after we visited Nick in person after one show. When I looked into the dummy’s dead, white eyes I sensed something staring back at me. I felt the same way I did when I played our unfinished game and the way I felt being around the possessed portraits. 

Nick patiently explained that we were silly to be worried about him. The dummy wasn’t possessed or haunted, he said with a chuckle. He’d convinced himself everything that happened with George was a result of a mental health crisis and the wraith never really existed in the first place. 

The more we pushed him, the more irritable he became. He laughed at us. He called us crazy and claimed we were jealous of his success. He told us we were all pathetic and then threatened to stop speaking to us if we didn’t drop the issue. 

We were still arguing with one another about how to get him to see sense when an unexpected opportunity presented itself. A few weeks later, Nick asked me to review a new act he was working on. I was the only one on good terms with him at the time but I managed to convince Nick to allow his friends to come over so they could apologize to him in person for the previous fight. 

The three of us had agreed to try something more radical. When we came over to visit, Matthew and Hayden. Once they’d both convinced Nick of their remorse we asked to see his newest act and he settled in to show it to us. The moment he got the dummy out, we sprung into action. 

His reaction was comical. He refused to give up on his act as we tried to snatch Tommy out of his hands. The dummy begged him for help as we tried to wrestle it away from him. It started laughing as he chased us through the house, its jaw swinging up and down as Nick ran after us. Nick was making the hysterical laughing sound and yet simultaneously wore a completely horrified expression on his face. 

Once we’d made our escape we smashed it into pieces with a hammer and threw the remains into the trash. 

The very next day Nick was back on stage with the same dummy, which didn’t have a scratch on it, acting like nothing had happened. He refused to speak to any of us again after that. 

We returned to researching the origins of the entity hoping to find a way to get rid of the source of our problems. I won’t get into this much because it was a futile exercise. When we asked for help online the responses we got ranged from disbelieving to making fun of us. We talked to two people who claimed they could help us but they both turned out to be trolls. That was about the extent of it. 

The wraith was manipulating Nick, I suspected. It gave him a taste of fame and success like he’d never experienced before and got him drunk on it. He quickly became dependent on the dummy since he couldn’t perform without it. 

Over time, Nick’s performances became increasingly disturbing and provocative. I continued to see them sporadically after our fallout, still convinced I could somehow get through to him. They were difficult to sit through. 

He knew certain things about the audience, who he frequently interacted with. The interactions he shared with people left many uncomfortable or offended. Others were entertained by his uncanny abilities and provocative personality. I saw people who were in hysterics after watching his performances and talked to others who were religious, fanatic fans of his. 

As its grip over his mind tightened, Nick began to talk to the dummy outside of shows. This was first spotted by his family but it became obvious to everyone else around him in time. He had begun taking it with him wherever he went. Near the end his brother claimed he never saw Nick without Tommy latched onto him. It had become his permanent companion. A part of him. 

This behavior didn’t do wonders for his reputation but by then he had accumulated a loyal band of followers who didn’t care how eccentric and messed up he acted. The wraith gave him the success he'd dreamed of since he was a child but it did so at an unspeakable price. 

As for what happened to Nick, we never figured out a way to help him. The last place he was ever seen was somewhere strange called the Grand Circus of Mysteries. He worked there for a while as one of the star performers before inexplicably disappearing off the face of the earth following a particularly disturbed act. The dummy left with him, but I had no doubt the thing living inside it was still lurking out there somewhere. 

I lost track of the entity for a while after it had finished with Nick. I assumed it had gone on to haunt somebody else's life. Personally I wanted nothing more to do with it. 

My remaining moved out of town and I soon lost contact with them. I think we all felt responsible for failing Nick and we saw each other as reminders of this failure. It was better for all of us if we put the past behind us and moved on with our separate lives. 

I was watching the news one day some years later. The anchor began discussing a sinkhole which had appeared in a stretch of desolate plains outside of my hometown. They described it as a black hole in the ground which sucked in all the light from around it. 

I visited the place in person a couple days later. By then half the people in town had gone over to take a look. 

I approached close enough to lean over and look down into the depths of the cave. When I gazed into the abyss I felt something deep within staring back up at me. 

There I fell into a kind of daze. I felt as if I were falling into the blackness. The world around me became unreal and distant. 

My wife who’d gone out there with me claimed I stood over the hole for over a minute, swaying slightly as I stared down into it. 

It was her who broke me out of my trance. She had to slap me several times before I returned to my senses. By then, I was leaning over far enough that she swore I was about to fall in. 

I’ve been keeping track of the sinkhole since I visited it. I heard a group of kids dared someone to venture inside shortly after I went there. Jeff, I believe his name was. 

He reappeared a couple of days later with no recollection of having gone missing. 

I saw an older version of this boy in the news the other day, nearly ten years later. After I heard about what he did I figured it was time for me to finally get this story out there. 

I’m guessing the wraith has moved on from him by now. Perhaps it returned to the sinkhole, or maybe it has attached itself to a new conduit. Wherever it is, I don’t doubt it is searching for another victim. 

Be safe out there.

*How do I best utilise Alchemical Scholar on this character?*

For context, I'm playing a level 1 Forensic Medicine Investigator, very focused on healing. We are using the Free Archetype rule. I will likely be taking the Medic Archetype starting level 2. This was heavily recommended in the thread I mentioned earlier. It's a Human with a Hobgoblin Adopted Ancestry and the level 1 Alchemical Scholar feat. I originally figured this could really help me out to craft health potions and prepare during downtime. I didn't realise crafting potions takes a REALLY long time to get any benefit out of potions.

SO, I figured I could be picking up an additional archetype at either level 4 or 6, or find another way to make good use of Alchemical Scholar. I will list my build ideas here, and could really use some advice on which direction to go in:

1. Pick up Strategic Repose at level 4, finish out medic at 5 with a Skillful Lesson, and pick up Alchemist Dedication at level 6 with Predictive Purchase as class feat.
2. Same as above, but instead of Predictive Purchase, take Advanced Alchemy for daily prepared elixers.
3. Finish Medic at level 4, and forego Strategic Repose for Alchemist Dedication to pick up Quick Alchemy early, then expand on this with Advanced Alchemy and either Strategic Repose or Predictive Purchase at level 6.
4. Same as 2, but instead of Alchemist Dedication with Advanced Alchemy, pick up Gunslinger Dedication with Munitions Crafter (for ammo and Life Shots).
5. Same as 1, but instead pick up Wandering Chef (either would work for getting the coffee, this is somehow just... Fun, I guess? I don't actually see the benefit of this one over Alchemist, but it could be fun)
6. Same as 1. but make sure to pick up Communal Crafting early, and then just rush crafting Elixers of Life with the help of my party, and accept I will only ever be a discount Alchemist (with a nice bump in utility at level 6 and 8)
7. Don't even consider Medic, dedicate to Alchemist all the way starting level 2.

I should also add, I believe our GM is actually quite chill about the crafting thing, and he likely won't have us take as much time doing it, but I'm also kind of doing this as a mental exercise to see if I can get more utility out of Alchemical Scholar.",2,1740129100.0,Pathfinder2e,0,1.0,False

1iumkhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1iumkhn/what_should_i_think/,What should i think ?,"Today, I took the train to travel far away just to have a coffee and leave a note, not even sure if she’ll read it… What madness, if you ask me.

My mind tells me it’s madness, sure, but I can’t help but believe. I can’t bring myself to accept that this couldn’t be a beautiful story… The story of a girl who ignored a boy who loved her too much, and who, over time, realized the effort and suffering he endured for her… Until she finally joined him in a park, the address hidden in a scented note left on a whim, the exact spot concealed within a beautiful poem… That she would meet him, and the two of them would kiss in silence among the trees, sealing a moral of forgiveness and sincere love.

A fairy tale, if you ask me… It’s far more likely that this girl will sleep with another guy, out of pure lust or just to forget… Forget that this boy once lost it because he felt alone and anxious… That she sees this ""too loving"" boy as a psychopath stalking her… And that, in the end, instead of meeting him, she never shows up… And he waits in silence, only to go home and hang himself.

Life is fascinating. One story, two scenarios… As many possible endings as there are thoughts to imagine them.

In the meantime, I wonder what she’s thinking. What scenario is playing in her head? Such a different vision… I was never given a chapter in her thoughts, so all I can do is speculate.

Anyway, I had things to say about this strange situation… I’m stuck between my love for this girl and the pursuit of a fairy tale, between calming down so I don’t scare her… Without wanting to forget her, because I still care… It’s all too complex, when in reality, all it would take is an open-hearted conversation. But all I get is silence… I’m starting to think that walls could talk.

I guess lack of communication is humanity’s greatest curse, the root of conflicts, wars, and murders…

But which one? I would prefer an electric grinder. I’ve looked at used ones like the Rancilio Rocky ($140), Baratza Encore ($65), and Probarista DF64 Gen1 ($280). If I look at new grinders, then the Fellow Opus and DF54 are options ($210-280).

I live in Denmark, so there aren’t many used grinders for sale.

I knew you're supposed to let your teas rest and all once they arrive, but I had to give them a try right away  and I already love them? And I had to share my excitement somewhere

My first was a shou (2014 Wu Liang ""Sweet and Thick"") and I finally understand what people mean by ripes tasting like wet dirt, but in a good way. I was initially put off by the smell because it doesn't smell like something you'd typically drink, but it was such a comfy drink and so grounding with a shockingly sweet follow-up and I don't think I'm going to be scared of 'wet earth' tasting notes anymore because this was such a nice drink.

I was nervous to try the sheng I got (2024 YS ""Spring Morning"") because people on this sub tend to recommend not trying a young sheng first, but this one knocked it out of the park! Firstly, the dry tea itself smells *divine*, which is such an exciting start to a tea session. The taste is gentle and sweet with a little leather? And such a refreshing, hydrating drink, very different from the shou I tried but INSTANT love, and lasted so many steeps.

I even tried a Fu Cha (Mojun 1368) which was interestin in a completely different way. It had like the shape of bitterness, and an aroma that was almost like a cheap diner coffee? Some sort of funk that I couldn't put my finger on, but I couldn't stop thinking about it, and then with further steeps it turned into a gentle sweetness that lasted for ages after I finished, and I don't know if I technically ""liked"" it, but I want more and I want it even stronger next time.

Basically, I somehow ended up with all bangers with my first go, and they taste fantastic, and I am *so* excited to see how much their flavor develops after I let them sit a little bit (but I'm not sure if I'll even be able to wait because they're all so yummy). I can honestly say I don't think I've ever been as delighted with a new tea before as I have been with this first adventure into puer. I'm so darn happy and my tea sessions with these teas have been such pure joy. I usually have such bad luck trying new teas, they almost always end up  just ""meh"" or it takes me ages of meddling to dial in my brews, but I somehow nailed the bullseye with all three of these and I wanted to share with people who might understand why I'm so happy over some leaves I got in the mail.",4,1740128179.0,puer,0,1.0,False

I own a Sage/Breville barista touch and thought I'd got to a stage where I was getting decent extraction.

I tend to pull a blank shot before anything to help the machine get to the right temperature. Then on the first shot, I get a decent 1:2 ratio on extraction in around 30 seconds. The beans are about 2-3 weeks fresh and I've found grind size 9 pulls a good shot.

The problem lies when I make a 2nd coffee straight afterwards. I honestly feel like I am doing everything exactly the same, but get a severe over extraction. Barely anything comes out!

1iumexo,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1iumexo/an_alien_plays_subnautica_part_2/,An Alien Plays... Subnautica - Part 2,"""Great days and Glorious Victory!""



Spiff stares blankly at the camera with a fake smile as the remains of the Sunbeam slowly trickle down into the ocean.



""I really don't want to do this! I really don't!""



Spiffle stares at the water, a bead of sweat on his brow and he swallows visibly nervous.



""Welcome back to... Sub-Subnautica. Apparently. I really don't want to play this anymore!""



Spiff resolves himself to his terrifying fate and resumes wandering around the island, getting a few samples of plants and scanning a few things he finds before returning to where he parked the Seamoth. It is here, he has his first encounter with a Warper. He gets in the seamoth and tries to leave, but is teleported out of the cockpit closer to where the strange creature can deal damage. Spiff loses half his health in this attack.



""WHAT!? How did I get out of the-AH! No Get away! Get away! What the \*beep\* Is that thing!? Begone beast!""



Spiff lashes out at it and luckily snags a knife hit on it before it can do more damage. Spiff hastily enters his seamoth again and retreats with haste. It's a decently long drive back to his home base and he wastes little time in retreating.



""Damn... I was unable to get a scan from it. Maybe I can do it next time. I need to carry more health kit thingies before I take on hostile entities. At least so I can scan them really. Anyway, That was... strange. Did that thing teleport me outside the seamoth? Seems like that's what happened. I'll have to avoid those things then.""



Spiff returns home and docks the seamoth into the Moon Pool. He exits and his face lights up.



""OH! I forgot completely! I can name this thing! For some reason my comments section REALLY, really wanted me to name it this. I have no idea why but here you go.""



Spiff enters the word 'Harschenglorb' into the name and it appears on the Sea Moths hull.



""I... Have no idea what this means. Some guy in my comments mentioned this word and there it was with nearly two thousand upvotes so... Here you go Jacobson. Enjoy?""



Spiff shrugs this nonsense and resumes working, putting away his loot and grabbing some food items. He then gets to building base items again and expands with one of the Large rooms, this one a Large Room with a glass dome top.



""OOOO I like this! This is pretty! I'll put some plant pots here. Maybe I can put the bed there, the office desk here...""



Spiff goes into 'interior decorator' mode and starts turning the glass domed room into a nice spot to live, a bedroom/office combo essentially, going out to retrieve a coffee machine from a wrecked area for the sake of décor. Unfortunately for him, base integrity is a thing, and as he starts to install glass to the dome for more sunlight and views outside, base structural integrity fails as he installs a Water Filtration Machine. The base goes offline and starts to fill up with water. Spiff doesn't notice, being too busy with his decorating and only figures it out when he notices the water covering his bed.



""What!? Water!? Wh-What's going on!?""



Spiffle scrambles about for a few minutes before his base fills completely. He surfaces for air and goes back down, then spends a half an hour in a panic trying to repair his base fruitlessly. Whenever he fixes one hole, another opens up.



""WHY WON'T THIS THING FIX! WHAT AM I DOING WRONG!! GAAAAAH!!""



Spiff stops, pauses the game and opens the wiki. He points his finger at the camera and swears.



""Don't you judge me.""



Spiff looks through the wiki and slaps himself with the palm of his hand. He tabs back in the game and adds a reinforcement bulkhead to one side of the base. This one change results in the structural integrity being fixed. He then repairs the holes and the base begins to drain.



""Well. That was annoying. What was I doing? Oh yes. I was looking for something, let me check my data pad thingy.""



Spiff looks through his journal and finds the message showing where he needs to go next.



""Okay then... Apparently there's two I can go find now. One of which is a Thermal Power Plant and the other which is a Disease Research Facility. Both are... Well very bloody deep. I need that Prawn suit thing and a... What was it again? Cyclops? Yeah those. Need those to do that. I can explore a bit more in the seamoth for now though. Might find a good spot for a base! Something more... Scenic?""



Spiff fits a Depth Module to the seamoth, sending its crush depth to 500m. He hops in and starts to follow a distress signal from ages ago, heading to the East from the pod, returning to the Jellyray forest. Spiff encounters more Jellyrays, the forest being full of them, and keeps going, scanning bits of wreckage as he goes. He fully unlocks the blueprint for the Cyclops and finally arrives near his location. Two streaks of light moving in the darkness catch his eyes.



""Oi... What's that? What is that? It's moving. I don't like that!""



This is Spiffles first look at an Ampeel, he's so fixated on the worm creature with electricity for a body, he fails to notice a Boneshark coming up to him. It roars, Spiffle squeals, turns and runs away as his Seamoth takes damage.



""NONONONONOOOOOO! Screw you! SCREW I SAY!!!""



He retreats to the forest again among the Jellyrays and cowers for a little while.



""Maybe this isn't the best spot to put a base with that shit nearby. I can see other things though. There's small purple things in the area. I wonder if I can scan them. Probably can. But... the scaries... Do I have to?""



Spiff approaches the edge of the new Bulb Biome and sits at the edge.



""I have to... Don't I?""



Spiff takes a deep breath, lets out a warrior war cry and charges in, unfortunately coming face to face with an Ampeel. He dodges it and hides behind a Bulb Bush and shivers there for a bit. Then... Something happens. His screen flashes, vision blurs and a face of some strange creature appears. A ghostly voice speaks to him.



""What... Are... You?""



""NO. NO. No. No. FUCK NO. NO. I'm out. No. NO!""



Spiff panics and retreats from the area, going as far away as possible. Unfortunately for him, he keeps going East, and eventually finds his way into The Abyss. He comes across a sheer cliff with darkness and dead silence going straight down and tries to follow it down, sticking close to the cliff's wall.



""Oh... Oh dear... What even is this? Is this a thing? Hmm... Where does it go? I can't go deeper. Crush depth reached here... What now? It goes a LOT further. That... dark. The fact I can't see anything down there really REALLY makes me scared. I don't want to-""



Spiffs train of thought is interrupted by a loud, echoing roar in the depths. By the time he notices what was going on, a Ghost Leviathan has spawned and is already right on him. He panics, presses the wrong button and is ejected from his Seamoth. He can't do or react to anything, too busy panicking as a loud, horrified screech comes from him. The Ghost Leviathan attacks him and does severe damage to him. He panics, trying to swim away and gets eaten.



Spiff has turned a pale shade of pink at the sight of the Leviathan and has now faced his second death in the game. He keeps squealing like  a piglet in pain and slowly crawls out of his chair under his desk where the noise slowly dissipates. The credits roll to the sound of him starting to do a MANLY cry of fear.



TOP COMMENT: Lol. Ghost Leviathan. That's the MANLIEST squeal of terror I have ever heard. My wife had to come in and pull me off the floor, I was laughing so hard!



Spiffs response: Oh bugger off! You haven't faced anything like this before so I doubt you can understand!



Reply: Pfft please. I work as a station hand on Calisto. I've gutted and eaten WORSE. Calistan ClawFish is DELICIOUS!



Spiffs reply: Wait... What?

The camera starts up and shows Spiffle in view. He doesn't say anything and instead pulls up a picture of a group of humans smiling at the camera, around the corpse of some kind of Whale/Eel kind of eldritch monster hoisted up by its skull from a hook. The caption for the Photo is: ""Calisto Fishermen and a Prime ClawFish Catch!""



""So I found out humans actually DO have worse things in the universe than things in Subnautica. And they not only hunt them for sport but also hunt them for food. I have made a note to NEVER visit the human home system. The place sounds goddamn terrifying. Anyway... Subnautica again.""



Spiffle sighs heavily, truly not wanting anything to do with this anymore and carries on from where he left off - with no inventory, no tools, after he'd just been eaten by a monster.



""Oh Gods I have to rebuild all of my equipment again!""



Spiffle cries a bit as he starts regaining all his gear. After a short building and resource gathering montage, Spiff is about to get a new Seamoth when he notices the blip on his hud.



""Wait! My seamoth is still alive!? They didn't-OH... Right, I remember. I panic-buttoned and got out of it. Well that's okay. Just need to go in and get it then!""



Spiff spends a short amount of time heading to where he left the Seamoth using a Seaglide as his speedy transport. He tries in desperation to avoid the Ampeels and Bonesharks in the area, barely escaping an Ampeel attack on the way. He finally arrives at the destination and surfaces.



""By all the Gods this is... rather daunting... Very daunting in fact. Just an empty ocean as far as the eye can see. Empty, deep ocean. I HATE THIS!!""



Spiff unconsciously takes a deep breath as he dives, heading for the Seamoth. It's 400 meters down and is just barely inside his dive range. He quickly hops in the seamoth just as a Ghost Leviathan Spawns and starts its routine.



""NONONONO GETAWAYGOAWAYGETAWAYGOAWAAAAAAY!!!"" Spiffle squeals in a most un-manly manner and resurfaces, charging towards the pod and his base.



""I HATE THE OCEAN!!!""



Spiff runs back to the pod, gets in and spends a few minutes just shivering in his seat.



""Why are they so big!? Why do they glow!? WHY ALL THE TEETH!?""



Spiffle tries to reclaim his sanity for a few moments, going off camera for a bit. He returns, holding a bobblehead of Luigi from Mario Kart.



""Okay then.... Let's get going. Need to visit this place. Do more work. Lets go uhh... that way.""



Spiffle heads towards a beacon on his Hud for Officer Keen's broadcast location. Through the weeds, across a desert biome and near a few cave entrances near the entrance to the deeper caves. He goes to the location and hovers near the surface.



""Oh no... Can't it be above the water for once!? Come on! Four hundred meters down. My seamoth can barely handle that... Well... here we go then.""



Spiff dives down and hovers barely above the destroyed pod, picking up two PDAs, then quickly retreats back into the seamoth and returns to the surface.



""Why does this feel so BAD? Damn ocean! Anyway... lets see then. Officer Keen... detected dry la- DRY LAND!!!""



Spiffle ignores the rest and frantically looks around for the new beacon. On spotting it he charges ahead at full speed. He follows the beacon, encountering the island. With careless abandon he finds the floating island and launches the seamoth out of the water onto the beach and immediately hops out.



""LAND! FINALLY! STURDY GROUND!!! I AM MOVING MY BASE HERE RIGHT NOW!!!""



Spiff ignores the games questline again, and focuses the next twenty minutes to a montage of him systematically disassembling his base, transporting all the resources to the new floating island and sets up everything but the moonpool on the ground on the island, creating a series of silly tunnels as he tries to make it look at least vaguely nice, snaking it around and over a cliffs edge.



""There! Lovely! Home. Out of the FFFFFFFFFucking water! I can think again! Yey.""



Spiff only now takes the chance to explore the island, and starts walking the winding pathways around the area. On finding Keen's PDA in a cave-like area, he follows the pathway up to a base. He dodges and weaves through the Cave Crawlers in the area and finds a few PDAs, Lantern Fruit trees, Chinese Potatoes and the Marblemelon fruit. Spiffle battles with more Cave Crawlers and scans some stuff for base building and working on other things. He spots a base structure high up on a cliff.



""Hm... All the way up there? How'd they get up there though? Oh. Of course Spiff there's a pathway up. Follow the gravel road I suppose.""



Spiff carries on, fighting cave crawlers and marvelling at the view, scanning everything he can as he moves. He eventually finds the top of a cliff and recovers a PDS from an observatory position. Only to find there are two clifftop observatories, and the one he found wasn't even the one he saw first. Just as it goes night time.



""OH BUGGER OFF! Oh fine. Can't go anywhere for now. Too dark and being stupid I forgot my flashlight thingy. Cant see. Wait until morning.""



Spiff wanders about the top of the cliff for a bit. Then he bothers to look up, seeing the twin moons around the planet. The small moon in the far background, along with the MASSIVE red moon in the foreground, moving all too fast for comfort.



""What the hell? Wow... That's.. Has that always been there? I've seen that before right? Why is that so... unsettling? That moon must be in a degrading orbit to be that close! Bugger me, I hate that!""



Spiffle watches the moon drift about and eventually fully circle the player. For some reason Spiff has a moment of calm as the sun comes up. The orange and red tones of sunlight poke through the horizon, the small moon above it slowly fading into the distance as the rays of light shoot past the wreckage of the Aurora.



""My Gods, that is pretty! That's very pretty for a game from ancient times. And all this from an independent developer too. This is... Impressive! I love games that add in all this detail!""



Spiff waits until the sun is up, then heads back down the path to the other clifftop. Halfway up the mountain, everything suddenly goes dark again.



""Oy! Oy! Where'd my sun go? It's daylight!""



Spiff looks up, and spots an eclipse. The large red moon had moved in front of the star, creating a spectacular eclipse. Spiff watches it for a bit longer and smiles at the sight.



""Pretty... Oh... Well that's how they do it! You can see in the footage! Look! It's the old Skybox system. The sky is in a virtual dome thing, that an image is painted on to. Or something. For my non human viewers, this is how the human games do it before Realistic Sky Rendering as a thing. They'd put a 3D image on a flat surface, then make it move around you, giving the illusion of a sky. You can see it here. It works quite well, but it can still be seen. Human games used this system a lot. Very effective!""



Spiff gives a small explanation using his in-game cursor to point out how the skybox works, then resumes his climbing. He gets to the outpost, and acquires more PDA's for later. He gets some new signals to go to. But most importantly, he finds the blueprint for the Indoor Growbed.



""OOO! Big plant! I can plant this Lantern fruit in it, I hope. YAY! Good food! Maybe this Bulb thing too? Food supply is fixed forever!""



Spiff heads back to his seamoth, then back home to let it charge while he faffs about with base building for a little bit. Spiff builds another Large Room where he puts in a bed, a bench facing a window, coffee machine and an office against a wall. He uses the partition system and door to make a small room sort of like a kitchen, where he puts a coffee machine, vending machine and Marbelemon planter. He creates a rather cosy spec. Here, he finds the picture frame, and figures out he can put a custom picture in it. He tabs out, does some fiddling about a bit and returns. The picture is a photo of his Tea Empire Simulator playthrough, and its the photo of him and his family in top hats, monocles, gentlemanly dress and holding cups of tea.



""There. It actually feels like home! What was I doing again? Oh! Damn, right, curing a disease so I don't die horribly. Right. Where do I go? Lifepod 12 according to my hud. Right... Harschenglorb! Come hither! What even is that name...""



Spiff hops in the Seamoth and then heads out towards the location. He goes through the Shallows, the Red Grass Desert, then gives a happy squeal as he goes through the Shroom Tree Forest, smiling at the JellyRays. The happiness doesn't last too long, and he finds himself near the AmpEel habitat.



""I don't want to go in there. I hate there. Why do I have to go there?""



Spiff groans in fear and frustration and moves around, dodging Bonesharks and AmpEels through the bulb bushes. Eventually he gets to the pod and hesitantly exits, scrambling to get into its remains. He finds blueprints for Charge Fins, a PDA with more data and buggers off. He hastily gets back in the Seamoth, getting attacked by a Boneshark covered in green tumours, and squeals in terror as he retreats back home.



""I HATE THAT PLACE.""



Spiff spends more time base building, acquiring more resources and building another Moonpool.



""Right... I'm not going anywhere else. Need a thing... What was it again? Oh the PRAWN Suit! I want that! I can smack stuff with it If I remember. Well hopefully it had claw arm things. Knowing humans, if it has claws or arms I can use it to smack things.""



Spiff heads up to the Mobile Vehicle Bay to find out what he needs to build a PRAWN Suit and groans angrily as the price for one is more than expected.



""EXPENSIVE. Plasteel, Aerogel, Glass, Lead, Diamonds. That aerogel is the pricey bit though. Dammit. Okay... FRANCINE!!! RESOURCE COLLECTION MONTAGE!!!""



A montage of Spiff scrambling around for resources, most of which he already has follows and Spiff quickly builds the PRAWN Suit. He puts the Seamoth in the new Moonpool and the Prawn in the old moonpool. He changes its colour to be similar o the Seamoth and leaves the name blank for now.



""Hmm... What to call it. Meh, leave it to the comments, what's the name? Now, to work. Depth Module Mk1 is all I can do for now, plus the grappling arm. Need that. Right... erm... Where do I go? Lifepod 13. Seamoth for this one I think.""



Spiff moves around and finds the Jellyray habitat again, grabbing the PDA in the pod wreckage. Then he heads back home to try out the Prawn Suit. The beacon marked 'Proposed Degassi Habitat' Is his next target.



""Righty then, the next bit is a story bit I think. I'll take the Prawn suit for this one, see how it performs. The AI on my PDA said that people feel ultra powerful when they're in these things. Maybe that's actually the case? I don't know. No idea how long so, food, water, extra power cell. Right, I have 700m crush depth, so I should be fine. Let's go!""



Spiff gets in the suit and wanders off towards the beacon. He fumbles, noting how slow and cumbersome the suit is in the strange terrain, compensating for the difficulty by using the grappling arm. He defends himself against a SandShark and chuckles evilly as it runs from him.



""I knew it! If it looks like it can smack, it will in fact smack! Now... where's this thing? Underground? Under me? Where is an entrance I can use?""



Spiff fumbles around for a bit as he tries to find the entrance and finally finds it - the underground mushroom biome with the CrabSnakes.



""I SAID NO.""



Spiffle pauses, saves and exits the game, then his cries of despair can be heard fading into the background to a chorus of ""I HATE THE SNAKEWORM THINGS! I DON'T WANT TO, I DON'T WANT TO!!!""



TOP COMMENT: LOL you really hate the Crabsnakes THAT much Spiff? Seems a bit silly to me.



Spiffs reply: BUGGER OFF YOU OLD FART!!! You've never had to deal with those (VERY CENSORED) things!



Reply: Au contraire. \*user posts a link to Calisto Dockyards, showing the recovered fresh kill of a 400 foot long IceWorm\*



Spiffs reply: Oh for... CRAZY BASTARD HUMANS!!!





\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*





""Great Days And Glorious Victory!""



Spiff stands at the edge of the entrance to the Mushroom Caves biome.



""WHY AM I PLAYING THIS GAME AGAIN!?""



Spiff swallows his pride and un-pauses the game.



""Right... Welcome back to Subnautica. I hate this game... I HATE THE OCEAN!! But... I must do this... apparently. I hate you all.""



Spiff glares at the camera angrily and then jumps into the hole, falling straight down into the underground JellyShroom caverns Biome. Spiff pauses mid-fall as he spots several CrabSnakes swimming around in the nearby area and he visibly cringes, shuddering in disgust.



""I HATE THIS PLACE!!!""



Spiff collects his thoughts, and resumes falling. He has the good fortune of dropping right on top of the Degassi Habitat, where he needs to collect data. He parks the Prawn, clambers inside and dodges several Drooping Stingers and recovers various blueprints, bits, pieces, PDA's and a few other things, acquiring a few new blueprints. With that completed, Spiff hastily retreats before noticing anything, and doesn't bother reading any new data before he hurriedly hops back in the suit and desperately clambers out the way he came in.



""I HATE THIS PLACE!!""



Spiff grumbles to himself as he trundles back home to take stock of everything he found and stocks up on water, food and sits on the bench he made before reading everything.



""Ah! Water Filtration System. Ultra High Capacity Tank? OOoh im building that one! and... Passwords for the Aurora, stuff to do. Right, good. Oh... A radio message huh?""



What follows isn't necessarily one of the most iconic messages, but definitely one of the most memorable moments in the game's history. It's a message from two Youtubers named Neebs and Appsro from the Gaming Channel 'Neebs Gaming'. Youtubers who did a Roleplay series for the game during its early days.



""This is Alterra HQ. This may be our only communications window.

We can't send a rescue ship all the way out there, so Aurora, you're just gonna have to meet us halfway.

We've uploaded blueprints to the ship's computer.

\*Offmic\* We're doing a sandwich run, are you in?

Uh, yeah, give me a second.

Blackbox data shows the high security terminal in the Captain's quarters is still functional.

\*Offmic\* Becky's leaving like in five minutes.

Alright tell Becky I'll just take the regular.

\*Offmic\* The regular?

Yeah, she'll know what I mean.

\*Offmic\* And if she doesn't?

Just tell her the regular dude.

\*Offmic\* If I say regular, and she's like ""what's the regular,"" I have to come all the way back up here.

The code should be 2679.

The regular's just a ham and cheese.

\*Offmic\* Ok, well would you just say ham and cheese?!

Ham and cheese!

\*Offmic\* Ok.""



Spiff looks at the camera and blinks.



""Well... Okay then. Back to the Aurora I go I guess. OH! Wait, before I go. I have a thing. Previous video I asked for a name, the Prawn Suits name is: Steve.""



Spiff goes to the suit and looks at the name, a bright blue juxtaposed with the suits low purple.



""Yup... Steve... It was the most upvoted comment on that video so... There you go. Now I need to go to the Aurora.""



Spiff heads to the Seamoth Harschenglorb and proceeds to the Aurora once more. He dodges and weaves, scaring himself out of his own skin from the angry yell of a Reaper Leviathan that's too close for comfort. He finally arrives, hops into the Aurora and makes his way through. He has to go through it again, as by now the majority of stuff had respawned, including the fires, and has to work his way back up to the Captain's Quarters, grabbing a few bits he missed on the way.



""Right... 2679... There! What's in here? A poster of the Aurora? A miniature figurine of the Aurora!? OOOhhh that's pretty! Data Terminal. Jupiter Escape Rocket? OOHHH I need to build that to get out of here huh? Yay! Right... I need to get out of here.""



Spiff exits the aurora and returns to the Seamoth, deftly dodging bobbing and weaving his way out of the wreckage before returning home. Spiff gets back and checks the ingredient list for the platform. It annoys him.



""That is expensive. AND I still have to build a Cyclops as well from what I know. Lets do the Cyclops first and do the main quest, or whatever it is. Lets see... Hmm... Not too bad. Lets build that then, just need more Titanium.""



Spiff casually gathers some resources and finally builds the Cyclops. Unfortunately he does an oopsie and when he builds it, he accidentally builds it too shallow - on top of his base. It flops down, doing some damage as it hits the roof, then flops to its side.



""Well shit. That was... stupider than usual. Goddammit Spiff you should've known this!""



Spiff checks the damage and then resigns himself to his fate. He has to move the contents of his entire base out of the way and deconstruct the part of the base the Cyclops is stuck on, in order to move it. He does so, two hours of work as he has to move all his resources, build a new dome, and then reconstruct everything again. By the end of it, he is most annoyed and finally, FINALLY, enters the Cyclops to see what it is.



""OOhh… Well finally inside. Oo storage lockers built into the hull. Ladder upstairs. Then... Oh! A docking bay! I can fit the prawn in here! Then here's the engine bit at the back. Upstairs we go. Oh my... That's a BIG engine... It works through here, Upgrade Fabricator? Okay. Good to know. Lots of space in here. Wait... can I build stuff in this thing!?""



Spiff equips his builder tool and is able to put down an Aquarium. He then spends the next solid hour in a montage that Francine helpfully skips through, to make his Cyclops more homely. He installs a Vending Machine, Coffee Machine, a small office, all the stuff he needs including chargers and a fabricator, moving his Modification station to the sub. He puts down a bed, a growing bed and Lantern fruit tree for food and water, then moves his new friend Reginald, into the new Aquarium.



""There! Feels like home! Now what was I doing? Oh yeah. Check my PDA for directions here. What do I do... hmmm... Ah I see. Disease research Facility, 1200 metres down. And a Power facility 800 metres down. Looks like there's something under the floating island too. Need to go there I guess. Okay, first thing. Floating island, let's go.""



Spiff docks Steve the Prawn suit in the Cyclops. The Cyclops now has a paint job and a name - pink with purple stripes and a blue name. Its name has been changed, the bright blue lettering reading 'Mini-Monk', likely a reference to Spiff's daughter who was seen playing Slime Rancher with her dad.



Spiff gets in the pilot's seat, turns the engine on and heads towards the island. He travels along the surface for some reason and uses the cameras to look around.



""I hate the fact I cannot see the bottom. I hate that. I really don't like that. Why am I playing this?""



Spiff hits the down button and he starts going down. He gets close to a cave network and gets annoyed.



""I was afraid of this... Need the Seamoth. The terrain here is too nasty, I can't be bothered with it. I'm just going to swim home, get the seamoth, then get back here and use that. I just cant be bothered.""



Spiff sighs, resigns himself to his fate and lifts the sub to the surface, gets out and swims home. He returns to his base after ten minutes of swimming on the surface, then drives back to the sub. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, then dives once again. He encounters floating bacteria colonies, strange plant formations and odd colours, and immediately turns pale at the sight of one of Subnautica's most irritating enemies: The Crabsquid.



""NO NO FUCK WHY??? WHY!? I thought I was safe from spiders! WHYTHEFUCKISTHISTHINGEXIST?""



Spiff yelps as it spots him, spiff just ignores it, and runs the hell away from it. He doesn't get far as the creature releases its signature EMP blast, then attacks the seamoth. The EMP blast disables the vehicle for a few seconds. Spiff panics, gets out and tries to do something but simply gets attacked himself. Spiff screams in terror, gets back in the seamoth and drives as fast as he can back to the surface. He dodges, weaves and bobs, popping up out onto the surface. He pauses the game and then goes on a tirade about the Crabsquid, and the fact the game has no guns.



Francine, Spiff's editor, thankfully skips the tirade and returns to Spiff going back down. His complexion is slightly purple now, as opposed to his usual blue indicating a mix of fear and anger. He goes down back into the cave system, encountering a Crabsquid again.



""EAT SHIT!!""



Spiff squeals a battle cry as he charges the creature and rams into it. This causes damage, but the beast retreats, allowing Spiff to slip past. Spiff carries on through the cave, encountering a base, a ruined habitat. Warpers and Crabsquid swarm the area, Spiff is NOT a happy alien as he moves towards the nearest opening. A Crabsquid sets up camp outside the base as he enters it, and he finds several PDA's and blueprints for the Cyclops Shield Generator.



""Shield generator? OO... I'm going to need that. I will install that later I think. Now what do I do with this... Ah! Entrance to the upper levels is over there. Have to go past that... thing though. I hate that thing. Do I have to? I have to, don't I?""



Spiff takes a deep breath, equips his knife and charges out with a loud squealing battle cry. He slashes at it, taking some damage in return but forcing the monster to retreat. Spiff quickly gets back in the Seamoth, getting his oxygen back. He quickly pops out, repairs the Seamoth and gets back in the structure. He gets the blueprint for the Alien Containment Unit, Orange Alien Tablet, two PDA's, a strange creature egg and a few decorative bits for his base. He immediately gets back in the seamoth and exits the cave without elaborating further.



In some kind of silent rage, Spiff just heads back to his base, occasionally giving the camera a death glare as he does. He docks the vehicle, and starts decorating his base. Eventually he gets the Alien Containment set up. He has to move his bed to put it in the new spot but puts down a hatch, and drops the creature egg he found in it.



""You know... it feels empty. Can I put plants in here? I can? Hmm... Let's go shopping for plants then.""



Spiff wanders around for a while, collecting plant seeds by slashing at them with his blade, and puts them all in the containment planters. He does however get distracted, and uses his Propulsion Cannon to collect some fish, a few creature eggs and gets even more distracted by the appearance of Lifepod 2's signature. He ignores the signature, noting where it is and heads to the Shroom Forest to find new stuff.



""An egg? It's blue.. wh... IS THIS A JELLYRAY EGG? CAN I ACTUALLY HAVE A PET JELLYRAY!? MINE MINE MINE I SAY!!!""



Spiff grabs the egg and makes a hasty retreat back to base and quickly deposits the eggs he fund, releasing some of the smaller fish he caught in it too. He gets even more distracted and builds another Large Base Module, putting two more Alien Containment Units in it. Francine sees where this is going and adds some Benny hill music to a montage of Spiff chasing Reginalds and grabbing whatever Jellyray eggs he can find. The sequence is quite comical considering how Spiff is so distracted he forgets he has a Propulsion Cannon to make catching fish easier, and chases Reginalds to his near death several times.



He enters his first Alien Containment Unit and spots a new creature.



""What... Is that thing? Tentacles? What are you? I can pick you up? I can? Well let me scan you first and then we will see what you do.""



Spiff scans it - the Cuddlefish - and grabs it, taking it outside. He drops it, releasing it into the wild. It wanders about and Spiff wonders what the hell this is for. He shrugs, then moves around a bit to collect more flora for his new project. The Cuddlefish is following him around.



""Are you following me? I can interact with you? 'Play with Cuddlefish'? O... Kay what do that do?""



Spiff interacts and an animation plays where the Cuddlefish give the player a high-five.



""Oh! OH... I get it now! It's a pet! I've had pets In games before! But this place is stupid dangerous. Can I order you to stay near base? I can! Okay. Is it just the hand thing or?""



Spiff spends a few minutes playing with the Cuddlefish and runs through its animations, smiling for the first time in several hours.



""Hmm... Humans would name you... Hmm... Hercules! That's from human mythology if I recall correctly. I will have you stick around here, It's far too dangerous for you to follow me. I have forgotten how many times I have been eaten. Don't want that happening to you. So... Stay! stick around near the base for now.""



The creature wanders off and hovers around the moonpool. Spiff sits back and smiles.



""You know what? That actually ended on a nice note. I'll call it for this one. I wish I could take the Cuddlefish with me on trips but it's too dangerous. Bye all!""



Spiffs outro plays.



TOP COMMENT: Yup. Cuddlefish. Added in, late in development. And here's a bit of trivia for you: You know the message for the captain's code? That message was done by a pair of Youtubers who did a roleplay of the game during the gamers development. The devs loved it so much they asked the guys to be IN the game! Isn't that awesome? Maybe you can do it too?



Spiffs reply: Seriously? That's real? Granted this game is ancient, but maybe that can happen. That would be an honour to be honest.



Reply: And yes, Crabsquid suck. Suck eggs. Crabsquid bad. Can kill with Gas Torpedo.



Spiffs response: GAS TORPEDOES? That's a thing? I need to check that. I NEED those. Those would be nice.",17,1740127552.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

Now I am regretting it and dont know how to tell her without ruining our friendship and the friendgroup.","
Hi People of Reddit,

I hope this is the right sub, I’ve been lurking in this sub and other subs for a while and truthfully never thought I’d ever find myself in a situation where I’d be posting here.
Anyway I’m using a throwaway account because I have no clue if my friends use reddit and would be able to find this and identify its me, because I’d really rather just get some advice on how to go about this situation first, before any of them catch wind of whatever is happening. There is a TL;DR at the bottom because this has become somewhat of a novel.

I’m going to preface this by saying I (21F) have had doubts about my sexuality on and off as a young teen but have felt quite comfortable saying I was straight for the majority of my life.
So recently through a project at my university I met this really lovable bunch of people. And even though the project has been completed for a little while now we still make it a point to meet regularly and hang out as friends. They’ve all truly become a source of joy for me and have made my time at uni so much more happy and bright. 
Well there is one girl in that group, who along with a guy was the sort of Project Lead of said project. There’s no actual hierarchy or anything, especially now that this project has ended. It wasn’t a graded project and there was no weird power dynamic or something like that.
Coming back to that point: I will call her Mary (28F) for the sake of clarity in this post. Well during the time we were working on the project we were chatting a little bit here and there about life and ambitions and all that stuff you talk about and she has been very encouraging and supportive. (Im hoping to go into a field that doesnt have very high job security and is hard to get into)
Well I like to bake and so towards the end of the project I baked some muffins. Everyone just kind of loves the muffins I make so I brought some in and everyone just kinda kept complimenting my baking. And then Mary more or less jokingly said something along the lines of “Are you still looking for your special someone? Because please take me.” 
And I sheepishly went “hahaha, sorry I’m straight” 
Famous last words.
As soon as those words left my mouth I regretted it. I don’t know why - I’ve only ever been with men in the past and I have not had any feelings for a woman as far as I can remember, but I instantly just felt weird about what I said.
So I have been stewing on this ever since. I kind of thought maybe I’d casually bring up how I am actually not sure if I am straight and I might be Bi or Pan, but the timer has kind of run out on that…

When we met up over the past few weeks. Mary was what i would describe as a little more clingy with me and she has also been continuously jokingly insuling me (all in good fun). She literally said that she always does this with people she likes.
Well colour me suprised when even her freaking best friend kind of glares at her and literally asks her if she has a crush on me. And Mary then just shushed him.
Now back to the most recent events that have me even more confused. 
Today we all met up again and went out for some drinks and watched a film in the cinema. Due to some of the group getting tickets earlier than the rest Mary and I ended up sitting separately from the rest with just the two of us together. She was insanely hyper because she had one too many coffees and for some reason she also just had no filter at all.
Well just as the film is about to start - I cant remember for the life of me what we talked about probably about her being a relentless tease and her absolutely hilarious way of subtily bullying people as a joke - she literally said: “[my name] you know that I love you” 
Yeah, umm that caught me off guard big time. I just remember saying something like “At least I know the insulting is coming from a place of love”
And she goes “yeah, it comes from a place of love.”
Just as an explanation in the language we speak there is two different ways of saying I love you - one that one uses for friends and family maybe the other that you really only ever use with your partner. And she used the partner one in that sentence.
And then as we are outside the cinema planning on where to go next she brings the entire situation from the project up again and here my memory is a bit hazy cause well I was busy stopping myself from being a red fucking tomato.
She was talking about how I rejected her then and she was a bit sad that I was straight. Since we are the most unserious group of people she said this while laughing and I think she was half joking half truthful. 

Well I think I am now at least sure she does like me.
Now here’s where the real chaos begins. As I said I thought I was straight up until that stupid joke during the project threw me for a loop. 
Because I definitely have been thinking about her a lot and I can confidently say there are definitely some sort of feelings on my end, too.
The problem is that I have not figured out myself and how I feel about her or just the possibilty (or fact idek) of me possibly being bi/pan. I have talked to a close friend about it and she told me that you can only really figure yourself out if you just go for it and see if its actually what you want. 
And while she might be right, I don’t want to put Mary in a shitty position where I give her hopes only to maybe find out I am not actually sexually attracted to women. Shes such a lovely person and honestly doesnt deserve that at all. Plus I really dont want to hurt her in the process of me trying to understand my feelings.
On the other hand I cherish our friendship and friendgroup a lot and I honestly am scared that I would break the group yp if any of the above happened.

Right now my questions are:
How do I go about:
1. Making it clear that I am in fact probaby not straight 
without giving Mary false hopes?
2. Approach the topic with Mary and ask her what is actually going on from her PoV?
3. Figuring out if I am actually bi without potentially breaking up a friendgroup that means the absolute world to me.

I would really appreciate your input and advice on this situation as it has really been eating me up inside. Sorry if the formatting and spellings is all over the place. I am on mobile and wrote this at 3AM while panicking. 

Tl.Dr: I jokingly turned down a friend because I thought I was straight, regretted it and now question my whole sexuality and dont know what to do.

1iume4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1iume4w/need_some_insight_on_my_dating_app_woes/,Need Some Insight on My Dating App Woes,"Hey everyone,

I recently got out of a one-year relationship and decided to dive back into the dating app scene. Back before my breakup, I had decent success—mutual attraction and second dates were pretty common. But in the last couple of months, I’ve been on 7 dates and every single one fizzled out after the first meet-up.

I usually keep it chill: a coffee date followed by a walk in the park. I’ve experimented with giving more compliments, initiating a bit of physical touch, and even just being more laid back, but nothing seems to work. I’m starting to wonder if maybe my potential dates sense that I still have lingering feelings for my ex, or if I’ve somehow lost that spark I once had.

I’m trying to stay genuine and not come off too excited or over-eager. Has anyone experienced something similar or got any advice on what might be off? Any tips on how to change things up would be much appreciated!

Thanks in advance for your thoughts.",1,1740127447.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
1iumdrm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iumdrm,Mondo FunnyBooks:1st Reddit appearance.,"(Reddit note. I’ve been writing a thing for years on Facebook called Mondo FunnyBooks, which is observations on the comics industry as I have one of the more unique and varied resumes as a professional in the business. This is the latest one.)

MONDO FUNNYBOOKS: TL DR: SCARCITY IS NOT A VIRTUE. 

In which our author kicks off but not before admitting he was wrong about two things: 

1. The Marvel/DC crossovers were the last treasure sitting in the vault of things not to be reprinted. 

2. That said items would never be reprinted. 

There. We said it. We were wrong. We didn’t think the legal red tape stopping these things being published again could be circumnavigated but they found a way. 

But.

They might as well not have bothered for all the good it’s done the retail community. 

We’ll come back to this but we feel there is an element to how comics make money that people who create comics are almost aggressively unaware of and that is the hand sell at the retail level. 

This SHOULDN’T need explaining but this is a simple procedure. A comic is published. Somebody on the retail level decides they think it is quite good, gets a few extra copies for the counter and recommends it to customers with a quick and entertaining synopsis. Ten people take a chance on it. Five like it enough to come back for issue 2. Three decide they’re going to trade wait on it. Two hate it. Fine. 

This is not arcane knowledge passed down from Grand Poobahs to Acolytes. This is simple episodic fiction retail 101. Dickens was serialised in popular newspapers and then the work was collected in a format accessible to fans and sold in multiple printings for decades. We on the shop level got behind things like Sin City, From Hell, The Goon, Love & Rockets, Too Much Coffee Man, ACME Novelty Library, Uzumaki via Pulp and said ‘You might like this.’ to the customers. 

LO and behold, these things are still in print. 

But you HAVE to start from that easy access point. The 1st issue of League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen was a $3 comic and when the print run of that and issue 2 ran out, Wildstorm put out a cheap reprint of the first two issues so again, those of us behind the counter could say ‘Try this.’ with a low investment asked of the customer. 

A LOW investment. If you’re VERY good, you can maybe get the 1st volume of Saga, Grindhouse or Ice Cream Man into the psyche of the potential reader as a thing to try out on impulse. Beyond that price point, you’re basically competing with someone’s common sense and they’re weighing up what else they could do with that £20/30 dollars. 

Again, this is not wild speculation. This is how these things work (and if you’re a retailer who isn’t teaching your till staff how to recommend episodic fiction as an impulse buy on a counter level in order to generate standing orders, there is no Day One variant that will make up for that. Teach the kids to do more than scan a barcode or you are dead in the water.) with decades of factual data and sales figures to back this up. The difference between, say, Spider-Man:Life Story staying in print & on recommended reading lists and any 3 dozen other Spidey books you care to mention falling into obscurity? 

The retailers read it and said ‘Yeah, read this. You won’t need to have read any other Spidey books to get this. It has a beginning, middle and end.’ This self contained nature is also why it’s much easier to recommend a X-Men: Grand Design, Wolverine:Enemy Of The State or Batman & Robin: Year One than Trials of X Volume 3. 

The decades of convolution and ‘But where do I START?’ are brushed away. Here is part 1. Now carry on. Is it a coincidence that Manga, which also sticks to the apparently revolutionary concept of making it clear exactly how to buy it, serialising popular things in cheap format then putting out collections in venues where the desired audience can access them, has utterly blown away everything the direct market has tried publishing in terms of superhero content? 

Compare the sales figures of the most recent Ultimate Spider-Man Volume 1 (and the fact that that distinction needs to be made is absolutely part of the problem) to any Death Note spin-off, any standard Attack On Titan and suddenly the problem of abandoning the simplicity of easy access work is made abundantly clear. If you charge more and make understanding how to read something more complicated than it needs to be, it is more difficult to explain as a counter staff member why, say, All-Star Batman 1 by this guy is different to All-Star Batman 1 by that guy and how both are not the same as Absolute Batman. 

Deathnote? A guy discovers a journal that allows him to kill anyone of his choice undetected. Start here with book 1.

100 Bullets? A wronged person is given a briefcase containing one gun and one hundred untraceable bullets. Here’s Volume 1. Oh, are you a bit short? Vertigo did a dollar reprint of the 1st issue. Take it on the house but if you like it promise you’ll buy the first book from me. 

So ANYWAY. 

Let’s just say, hypothetically, Chuck Palahniuk is a bit despondent on the sales of the Fight Club 2 comics and decides, given how massively his work has been misunderstood, he wants to convert it into a prose book. It’s published via Harper-Collins. It sells out of the first printing.

And that’s it. 

Chuck: Hey, I’ve been looking online. My book seems to be getting a lot of buzz. Uh. My royalties have dropped off despite my seeing copies of it on eBay for triple the cover price. What’s going on there? 

Harper-Collins Representative: Yeah. It’s great, isn’t it? The fans sure are happy.

C: Okay, um. Are they reading it? Are you planning to reprint it, like, today? Why am I asking you whether you’re going to reprint my top-selling book? 

HC-R: Well, the buzz is really important and obviously, the scarcity is helping it no end. I saw a copy go for triple figures on my way here!

C: Right but if people can’t buy it, they can’t read it or recommend it to their friends. How do I make money out of this?

HC-R: We were thinking…you have a Fight Club 3 script, right?

C: Yes…..

HC-R: What if, instead of a regular hardback/paperback publishing model, you went straight to a prestige volume with that. Real fancy. Say a $100 RRP! AND. We can pull all on your previous work from print and put it out in their format as well!!

C: But, I mean, that would limit my audience significantly. Something with those production values is going to have a tiny print run! And if you put my back catalogue in that format as well, the only people who’ll make money on my work is people selling copies to each other. 

HC-R: I mean, sure, but the TRUE fans will still support you. And the BUZZ, Chuck. Our name will be everywhere! 

C: I… 

Which is what happened with the Marvel/DC stuff. 

SURE, they cut through the red tape (JLA/Avengers is a separate case and we don’t fancy getting bollocked by freelancers suggesting somehow that because we know that seven thousand copies of something as popular as that comic was not enough to cover the customer base of American superhero comics that we hated George Perez.) but we could have very easily, say, sold a thousand copies of a reprint of Superman/Spiderman in a treasury edition as an evergreen. And a thousand more of the second one. Probably that much of Batman/Hulk. Add that amount to each issue of the Marvel vs DC mini-series. Imagine if that red tape had cleared enough to get the proposed Daredevil/Batman book by Brian Michael Bendis published. There is a definable override of critical thought that will see customers happily part with lots of money to buy a high-end crossover. 

That’s not even factoring in, say, second prints, director’s cut editions with new interviews, hardback versions like the Superman/Muhammed Ali book from a few years back, then hardbacks reprinting the Crossover Classics, trade paperback versions a couple of years down the line and finally, as the VERY LAST STAGE of the publishing plan, when every last single sale has been made, THEN you go to an Omnibus Edition, a fancy doorstop edition that reprints everything. A version for only the hardest of hardcore. But again, you do that AFTER all the other possibilities have been exploited. 

So anyway the Marvel/DC material went straight to the Omnibus edition. Print run? lol. Who knows. Not worth a fraction of, say, the amount of copies of From Hell or League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen that have sold over the decades using the exact process we went to such pains to document above. Are there any plans to reprint any, say, Uncanny X-Men/Teen Titans in the same fancy format they’ve been chucking out random issues of Secret Wars or Crisis On Infinite Earths? Nothing on the radar. 

But as we said, we were wrong. 

The issues of Spider-Man published in Mexico, where they decided to ignore Gwen Stacy’s death and turn her into a prototype of both Lara Croft and Iggy Azalea have popped back up in the collective psyche. And the first suggestion from professionals? 

‘Man, I hope they go with an Omnibus Edition for this.’ 

Sure. 

It’s a good thing the sales figures of new comics are so great that money on the table can be just left there. 

Also, for our money, Hulk vs Superman by Stern & Rude was the peak of the concept. We’d say hunt down a copy but good luck with that….

1ium8rl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVpnEng/comments/1ium8rl/top_cheap_vpns_that_dont_skimp_on_security/,Top Cheap VPNs That Don't Skimp on Security,"Finding a Virtual Private Network (VPN) that doesn't break the bank can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack filled with dodgy deals and questionable promises. Many cheap VPNs cut corners, leaving you with snail's pace speeds, spotty connections, or worse – selling your data to the highest bidder. But fear not! I've rolled up my sleeves, dove into the murky waters of budget VPNs, and emerged with a list of champions that offer top tier security without emptying your wallet.

# Why Bother With a VPN Anyway?

Before we jump into the nitty gritty, let's quickly recap why a VPN is a must have in this day and age:

* **Privacy Protection:** Keeps your online activities shrouded from prying eyes, like your ISP or that creepy neighbor who always seems to know what you're up to.
* **Security on Public Wi Fi:** Turns that risky public Wi Fi hotspot into a fortress, shielding your data from hackers lurking in coffee shops.
* **Bypass Geo Restrictions:** Unlock content from around the globe, whether it's binging shows on different Netflix libraries or accessing your favorite sports broadcasts while traveling.
* **Torrenting Safely:** Keeps your torrenting activity private and helps you dodge those pesky copyright notices.

# What Makes a ""Cheap"" VPN Worth Considering?

Not all budget VPNs are created equal. Here's what I looked for when compiling this list:

* **No Logs Policy:** The VPN doesn't track or store your online activity, meaning your secrets stay safe even if someone comes knocking.
* **Strong Encryption:** AES 256 bit encryption, the gold standard for security, keeping your data scrambled and unreadable to intruders.
* **Kill Switch:** A safety net that automatically cuts your internet connection if the VPN drops, preventing your data from leaking into the open.
* **Fast Speeds:** No one wants a VPN that turns your speedy internet into dial up. I tested for VPNs that minimize speed loss.
* **Large Server Network:** A broad network of servers in many countries, giving you plenty of options for bypassing restrictions and finding a fast connection.
* **Streaming Support:** Ability to unblock popular streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and more.
* **Affordable Price:** It's gotta be cheap, duh! But not so cheap that it raises red flags about its security practices.

# My Top Cheap VPN Picks for 2025

Alright, drum roll please! Here are my top recommendations for cheap VPNs that deliver value without compromising your security or sanity:

# 1. Surfshark: The Speedy All Rounder

* **Price:** Starting at a measly $2.19 per month (with a 2 year plan)
* **Why it's awesome:** Surfshark is the Usain Bolt of cheap VPNs, offering blazing fast speeds, a ton of features, and a price that's hard to beat.
* **What I love:**
   * **Unlimited Devices:** Use it on every gadget you own without batting an eye. Share it with the whole family!
   * **Speed Demon:** It consistently clocked some of the fastest speeds in my tests.
   * **Streaming Superstar:** Unblocks pretty much every streaming service under the sun.
   * **Clean Interface:** Easy to use apps that won't confuse your grandma (or you, if you're not tech savvy).
* **Things to consider:**
   * **Price Hike After First Term:** The low price is only for the initial subscription period, so be prepared for a bump when you renew.
   * **Not for Tinkerers:** If you're the type who likes to mess with every setting under the hood, Surfshark's simplicity might leave you wanting more customization.

# 2. NordVPN: The Feature Packed Fortress

* **Price:** Starting at $3.39 per month (with a 2 year plan)
* **Why it's awesome:** NordVPN is like the Swiss Army knife of VPNs, packing in a boatload of features alongside strong security and solid speeds.
* **What I love:**
   * **Top Tier Security:** Robust encryption, a strict no logs policy, and features like Double VPN and Onion over VPN for extra peace of mind.
   * **Massive Server Network:** With thousands of servers in nearly 60 countries, you'll always find a speedy connection.
   * **Streaming Powerhouse:** Unlocks a huge range of streaming content from around the globe.
* **Things to consider:**
   * **Slightly More Expensive:** It's a bit pricier than Surfshark, but the extra features might be worth it for some users.
   * **App Interface Can Be Cluttered:** The map based interface can feel a little overwhelming on smaller screens.

# 3. Private Internet Access (PIA): The Customizable Privacy Champion

* **Price:** Starting at $2.03 per month (with a 2 year plan)
* **Why it's awesome:** PIA is all about privacy and customization, giving you a ton of options to tweak your connection to your liking.
* **What I love:**
   * **Proven No Logs Policy:** PIA has proven in court that it doesn't store user data.
   * **Highly Customizable:** Offers a wealth of settings to fine tune your security and performance.
   * **Great for Torrenting:** Supports port forwarding and has a mountain of torrent friendly servers.
* **Things to consider:**
   * **Not the Fastest:** It's not a speed demon compared to Surfshark or NordVPN.
   * **Can Be Overwhelming for Beginners:** All the customization options can be a bit much for VPN newbies.

# 4. CyberGhost: The Streaming Specialist

* **Price:** Starting at $2.19 per month (with a 2 year plan)
* **Why it's awesome:** CyberGhost is like the Netflix whisperer, offering specialized servers for streaming and a generous 45 day money back guarantee.
* **What I love:**
   * **Specialized Streaming Servers:** Servers optimized for different streaming platforms, taking the guesswork out of finding a working connection.
   * **Longest Trial Period:** A whopping 45 day money back guarantee gives you plenty of time to test it out.
   * **Easy to Use:** Clean and intuitive apps that are perfect for beginners.
* **Things to consider:**
   * **Disney+ Issues:** It struggled to unblock Disney+ in my testing.
   * **Customer Support Lacking:** The support site isn't as comprehensive as some of the other VPNs on this list.

# 5. IPVanish: The Unlimited Connection King

* **Price:** Starting at $2.19 per month (with a 2 year plan)
* **Why it's awesome:** IPVanish lets you connect unlimited devices under one subscription, making it a great choice for large families or gadget hoarders.
* **What I love:**
   * **Unlimited Devices:** Connect every device in your household without breaking a sweat.
* **Things to consider:**
   * **Based in the US:** It's headquartered in the US, which might raise privacy concerns for some.
   * **No Crypto Payments:** Doesn't accept cryptocurrency payments for added anonymity.

# Other Cheap VPNs to Consider

While the above are my top picks, here are a few other budget friendly VPNs that are worth a look:

* **PrivadoVPN:** It's one of the cheapest VPN below 2$ per month, you want a balance of very cheap and decent performance.
* **PureVPN:** Boasts a large server network.

# Free VPNs: Are They Worth the Risk?

I generally advise steering clear of free VPNs. They often come with downsides:

* **Data Logging:** Many free VPNs track your data and sell it to advertisers.
* **Limited Bandwidth:** You'll quickly run out of data, especially if you're streaming or torrenting.
* **Slow Speeds:** Free VPNs often throttle your speed to a crawl.
* **Security Risks:** Some even contain malware.

While some decent free VPNs exist, the compromises are often too great. I think paying a few bucks a month for a reliable cheap VPN is a much better investment.

# How to Choose the Right Cheap VPN for You

With so many options, how do you pick the best cheap VPN for your needs? Here are some things to consider:

1ium8lt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ium8lt/aitah/,AITAH,For getting mad at my boyfriend for going to bikini babes . Today my boyfriend went to bikini babes which is a coffee shop where they wear bikinis basically half naked and he said the reason he went there was because that’s the only place he knows has good coffee meaning he goes there frequently. He also said his uncle helps the company out supplies them with heaters and other things . I don’t know what his uncle has to do with him going there . He comes in the room first of all with the wrong flavor I wanted blueberry banana he told the barista surprise me on one of the drinks and orange creamsicle on the other . He said the barista gave him Italian sodas at first and she remade them . He told me that she messed up and he was like I know you might get upset but I got them from bikini babes he didn’t have to tell me that . He could have just left it at I am sorry I got the wrong drink and moved  past the subject but he told me were he got the drinks from and it upset me . My feelings are hurt because I don’t see why he would go there if he is in a relationship now obviously if the roles were reversed I’d stop going .

1ium6fq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Internationalteachers/comments/1ium6fq/it_might_be_a_you_problem_why_job_hunting_prep_is/,It Might Be a You Problem – Why Job Hunting Prep Is Crucial for Teachers,"I've been seeing a lot of frustrated posts from teachers struggling to land interviews, getting ghosted after final rounds, or sending out hundreds of applications with zero results. And while, yes, the job market can be tough… sometimes the issue isn’t just the market—it’s you.

Before you throw your coffee at the screen, hear me out. Too many teachers treat job hunting like a side quest when it should be a full-blown strategy game. Schools aren’t just looking for someone who can teach; they’re looking for someone who stands out, presents well, and makes hiring them a no-brainer.

I’m not a teacher myself, but I’ve spent over a decade in finance, where networking, resume perfection, and interview mastery are non-negotiable. I’ve helped my teaching partner land jobs at top-tier schools, refining resumes, running mock interviews, and ultimately hitting an offer rate of 90% at schools we interview at. Turns out, a lot of what works in finance applies to education—but no one teaches teachers this stuff. So here’s what you need to know:

**Resumes: Stop Underselling Yourself**  

* Use a modern resume format. No, not the boring finance style—something clean, easy to scan, and visually appealing.  

* Brag. I get it, teachers are humble. Stop that. This is the one time you need to sell yourself.  

* Make every bullet point count. No fluff, just impact. Use action words like:
 * Increased student engagement by ___% through [specific strategy].
 * Improved test scores by X% by implementing [method].
 * Developed and led [initiative] that [result].
* If you don’t quantify your work, how will a hiring manager know the difference between you and the other 500 applicants who also “created engaging lesson plans”?

**Interviews: No Surprises, No Stumbles**  

* You should never be caught off guard by an interview question. Teaching interviews are predictable. If you prepare properly, you should already have strong, polished responses ready to go.  

* Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your answers. Rambling is the enemy.  

* The “Tell Me About Yourself” question is THE most important. This can also be phrased as ""Walk me through your resume"" or ""Tell us about your experience."" Regardless of how they ask, your answer needs to be a 60-second sales pitch connecting your experience, strengths, and passion for education to this job at this school.
If you fumble this, you’ve already lost half the battle. Nail it.  
 
**Extroverts Have an Edge (Sorry, Introverts)**
This part sucks for the naturally shy folks, but here’s the truth:

* Schools don’t just want a good teacher—they want someone they actually want to work with.  

* The interview isn’t just about your answers; it’s about the vibe. The unspoken “Would I survive a 5-hour road trip with this person?” test.  

* Be energetic, smile, be conversational. If it feels more like a chat than an interrogation, you’re winning. 
 
**Networking: Your Secret Weapon**  

* Who you know matters. Yes, even in teaching.
* A random connection (your mom’s coworker’s cousin’s dog walker) might be the reason you get an interview. Use every resource. If you work at an international school already, use every teacher to use their network. Most people will be happy to make an introduction. 
* Once you get an interview, everything else falls into place—but only if you’ve mastered the steps above.
  
Final Thought: Stop Mass-Applying and Start Fixing Your Approach
If you’ve sent out 100+ applications with no results, the issue isn’t just the schools—it’s your strategy. Work on your resume. Perfect your interview skills. Build connections. Once you do those three things, the interviews (and job offers) will come. Rant over.",21,1740126503.0,Internationalteachers,41,0.8,False

1ium418,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ium418/aita_for_refusing_to_unfollow_guys_on_instagram/,AITA for refusing to unfollow guys on instagram for my BF?,"So I (22F) was recently dumped by my bf (21M) because he didn't like that I have male followers/follow men on instagram. He claims that there is no reason I should have any guys on my account since I have a bf, and told me to block all of them. When I told him I think that's weird and controlling he freaked out. He said that ""guys only follow girls that they like"" and insinuated that every single dude who follows me just wants to hit.

I'd understand his concern if I was following tons of random ""hot"" guys and was posting thirst traps and whatnot. But I'm not. My account is private and only has people I know irl. I don't follow any celebrities, models, influencers, etc. Maybe it's odd but I truly only use instagram to keep up with friends and family. I post once or twice a year, the most tame photo at a coffee shop or something.

I have around 380 followers, and easily less than 50 are men. They are mostly people from high school/my hometown. At this point I've also posted my ex on my account multiple times, so anyone following me would have known I was in a relationship. I told my ex that none of these guys are a ""threat,"" but obviously if someone ever tried to make a move I would tell him about it and block them immediately.

I said all of this to him, but he was not having it. He said it was disrespectful for me to have guys on my account and gave me an ultimatum: him or the followers. And at first, I chose him. I said okay, if there's anybody you're weary about I'll block them in a heartbeat because obviously I valued our relationship over a mutual. But my ex doubled down, he meant EVERYONE. My gay best friend, my childhood friends, my bff's boyfriend of 5 yrs, my dance instructors, every man. I told him that's insane and refused.

I brought up his hypocrisy, because he was following a handful of random women I didn't know. None of them were models/celebs/etc, but in his ""logic"" he would only be following women he'd want hook up with... Obviously I don't believe that; I always assumed the girls he was following were just acquaintances and I was never concerned. His defense was they were old friends/from school, and he wouldn't remove them. Funny.

He also had a public account, and would post selfies and fit pics frequently. That didn't bother me, but it always made me wonder how he would've reacted if I treated my account the same way. I was worried that if I let him have a say over who I follow/follows me, he would try to control what I'm ""allowed"" to post next. Of course I never wanted him to feel insecure about our relationship, but this just feels like he had absolutely no trust in me.

His parting words were ""I hope you feel good knowing you chose instagram followers over your bf."" AITA? Should I have just removed the guys?",2,1740126222.0,AITAH,3,0.67,False

I’ve been there, stuck under the covers, convinced another five minutes of snooze time will cure my morning grumpiness. Spoiler: it never does. But after lots of trial and error (and a few embarrassing oversleeps), I’ve found a few quick fixes that *actually* help start the day on the right foot. Here are my top five:

1. **Pick Tomorrow’s Outfit Tonight**  
   Sounds silly, but it’s an easy way to skip the “Does this shirt even match these pants?” morning panic. Less decision-making first thing means more brainpower for what really matters.

2. **Drink Water Before Coffee**  
   Remember those nights you forgot to hydrate and woke up feeling like a raisin? Grabbing a glass of water first thing wakes up your system—plus, you’ll appreciate that sweet, sweet caffeine more when you’re not parched.

3. **Dive Into Your Favorite ‘Quick Win’ Task**  
   Nothing beats the satisfaction of crossing off something from the to-do list early. It doesn’t have to be huge. Even replying to a couple of emails or sweeping the kitchen can give you a mini jolt of productivity confidence.

4. **Use a Pre-Alarm Trick**  
   If you’re a chronic snoozer, set a softer alarm five minutes before your “real” alarm. It’s like a friendly warning shot for your brain: “Hey buddy, we’re about to wake up soon, so start your engines!”

5. **Create a Morning Playlist**  
   Music has a weird way of making mundane moments feel epic. Throw in some tunes that get you pumped (or at least keep you awake). Bonus points if you bust out some moves—dancing in pajamas counts as a workout, right?

Anyone else discovered a secret morning hack that’s been a game-changer? It’s wild how a few small tweaks can turn a chaotic morning into something (almost) magical. Feel free to swap notes. We’re all in this together.",1,1740125829.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
