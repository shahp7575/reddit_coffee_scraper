1ismaqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamericanytsnark/comments/1ismaqr/yapbrinas_essay_on_her_ex/,Yapbrina’s essay on her ex,"Did anyone read Yapbrina’s essay on her ex boyfriend (cold brew man)? It’s on her substack and I read it out of curiosity. Of course, the essay is biased because we can’t hear cold brew man’s side but I’m surprised how childish both of them are. I’ll give a summary if you don’t want to read it.

The essay mainly talks about one thing that happened - cold brew man offering to make matcha lattes for her since there were no matcha stores nearby.

Cold brew man tells her that he is thinking of getting into matcha lately, which surprises yapbrina because she knows he’s an avid coffee drinker. Yapbrina thinks he’s doing it just for her. But then cold brew man says “it’s not only for YOU, I actually want to get into matcha for myself too”. Yapbrina gets upset. Cold brew man is making dinner for them and Yapbrina is so upset, she says she needs to leave. Cold brew man is visibly hurt and says that he knows it was wrong of him to make that comment, but he says it’s because his feelings for her are so strong sometimes, he feels like he does/says really strong things and this is what he does to tame his emotions.


First, what grown ass once divorced 35 year old man actually says this kind of thing? It screams childish. Not only that, it’s crazy that Yapbrina got upset enough by this one thing while her boyfriend was cooking dinner for them, to just get up and leave. Both of them have issues. There was a post a while ago from one of cold brew man’s friends defending him, and while I don’t think cold brew man is necessarily the horrible avoidant non-commital man Yapbrina portrays him to be, he definitely has issues as well",1,1739909433.0,asianamericanytsnark,0,1.0,False

1ism9p3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1ism9p3/im_tired_of_wasting_my_time_going_on_dates/,I’m tired of wasting my time going on dates,"Like most of us, I work full time, need to cook/workout/hobbies, hang out with family/friends, do favors for others and have some time to myself.

When I approach dating, I carefully select who I will go on a date with as I usually can’t hang out with my friends if I go on a date. 

I do a phone call and if all good, go on a first date. I’m very clear and upfront with wat I’m looking for and try not to waste anyone’s time. 

I’ve just been having really bad luck. Most recently, I went on a 2nd date with a guy because he really wanted to see me. I was a bit ill and had another commitment but I still went to see him. 

After that, we had a minor disagreement on some philosophy perspective. I ended up not wanting to talk abt it because I really didn’t care. 

He got offended and tells me we aren’t compatible. Yeah we def aren’t compatible if he’d stop taking to someone over something that’s so abstract that it hardly matters. 

What irritates me is that I wasted my time on this guy. I want to date NORMAL people. 

If he didn’t wanna date me over something imp like differences in goals or he wasn’t attracted to me, that’s fine.

In fact, I wasn’t even attracted to him(bad coffee breadth is a mood killer) but still gave it time thinking attraction grows with time.

People r so impatient when it comes to getting to know someone. They think that another swipe and they’ll find someone better.

1ism9n1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1ism9n1/zepbound_and_a_newborn_its_been_interesting/,Zepbound and a Newborn! It's been ... interesting.,"New Dad here! Well, this is our second, so sort of new dad :)

Our baby was born on the 12th, and it's been super interesting taking this medication and having a newborn. I'll go into a bit of detail...

TLDR; Zepbound has been amazing. New dad fuel!

OK ... the details.

I started Zepbound on 1/18. I took my fifth 2.5mg shot just 3 days after our baby girl was born. Before I get into how it's been post-shot and a newborn, here's my experience with Zepbound so far.

* I started at 205, and I'm down to 188. Yay!
* The appetite suppression is real! I'm perfectly good at 2.5mg and may or may not titrate up later. 
* Zepbound gave me more energy. I get up faster in the mornings. Sadly, still I don't want any coffee... I used to love a cup in the morning.  
* My biggest challenge has been nausea. Out of the four shots I did before my baby, I threw up twice on those nights. (My diet is great, I eat really clean, I inject in the thigh, and yes... I've sniffed the 91% isopropyl alcohol wipes and it does help!) Still, nausea is just a thing for me.

OK.... now, how does this all apply to a newborn?

* The appetite suppression is still there. I still can't eat a lot in a sitting. But, I've found myself to be MUCH hungrier than before! At first, I thought it was the medication wearing off. But then I realized that I'm moving WAY more than before on about 3-4 hours of sporadic sleep. I've been trying to put more good calories in me that fill me up.
* You guys ... the energy thing is UNREAL with a newborn. Don't get me wrong, I still get tired, but my ability to just get up at 2am or 3 am, or 5 am, run downstairs, get some milk ready, change a diaper, is insane. Our oldest girl is almost 7 and it was NOT like this. I was a zombie in the first few weeks. This experience has been really different. And I still don't want coffee!
* Now for the nausea. I was SO scared that I'd be sick while my wife had to care for a newborn... I took a Zofran when I took the shot and OMG... No nausea. It was amazing. I might make this a thing from now on!

OK, this is all that my tired brain could muster at the moment. I'm definitely staying the course, continuing Zepbound, and doing my very best to stick to a good diet. PS - BIG thank you to EVERYONE in this group for your neverending support!",3,1739909362.0,Zepbound,0,1.0,False
1ism8q9,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpain/comments/1ism8q9/chronic_testicular_pain_that_comes_and_goes/,Chronic testicular pain that comes and goes,"I'm 21 years old, male, not taking any medications, and no serious previous diagnoses. About two years ago, I was diagnosed with Scheuermann's disease, a blockage in the sacroiliac joint, Schmorl's nodes and a few months ago, I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.

December 2023, I woke up from sleep feeling a very strange discomfort in my left testicle. It wasn't painful, but it was a new and odd sensation. This lasted for about a week, during which both testicles felt sensitive, requiring me to be cautious about sitting down (haha), and they were a bit more sensitive, rarely painful, and if they were, it was very mild. After about a week, it went away, but just in case, I visited my primary care doctor.

I told her about my issue, and she performed a physical examination of my testicles. She said she didn't think it was anything serious and that, due to my back issues, it was quite possible that they were the cause of my discomfort. She advised me to see a urologist if it worsened. The same sensation described above (discomfort, mild pain, sensitive testicle that seems like it was bigger in mass - but my mind was maybe playing tricks on me) returned a week later, but this time in my right testicle, where it has persisted to this day. So, I decided to visit a urologist, who conducted a CT scan, blood tests for cancer markers, and a sperm sample analysis to check for bacteria. The only thing the urologist found was very mild varicoceles in the left testicle.

The tests came back clean, and the urologist said he couldn't help me with my issue since there was no apparent problem from a urological perspective after all those tests. However, if it continued to concern me, I should consult an orthopedic specialist and primarily look for the cause in my back.

These strange sensations mostly subsided over time; if they returned, it was only occasionally, perhaps once every couple of months, and lasted a maximum of a day, so I didn't really address it until I had to travel for work abroad. Since I wanted to go there healthy and not have any health issues on the way, I sought out an orthopedic specialist, to whom I presented all my medical reports. He performed a physical exam and said that unfortunately, some people experience these things without any apparent cause. He recommended some vitamins and sent me home.

I felt helpless. Along with all the symptoms, I also experienced a very unusual tingling sensation on the right side of my scrotum, which seemed to indicate a pinched or irritated nerve that would last for a few minutes and then disappear. Sometimes after waking up, whether I had slept on my left or right side, the outer side of my thigh would mostly feel numb. However, I attributed that to poor-quality underwear that had a protrusion pressing against my thigh all night. Additionally, I experienced a very strange sensation in the area (which I don't know the name of) between my scrotum and the inner right side of my thigh, just below where it connects to the lower abdomen. From a layman's perspective, there might have been a slightly enlarged epididymis, but it didn't seem like epididymitis. For a while, I attributed this phenomenon to caffeine, as the constricting sensation and discomfort usually occurred after drinking coffee or energy drinks. So, I stopped consuming them, and it seemed to help.

Then there was a longer period of silence during which these problems almost completely disappeared, and I didn't encounter them for some time. Symptoms appeared maybe once every 3-4 months in the form of a sensitive scrotum and a very constricting feeling in the area I described earlier (as if it was inside the right side of my thigh). I didn't really address these issues, as they didn't bother me often, and over time, not at all. However, today is a different story.

This occurrence primarily happens when I sleep on my right side, as whenever I experienced these issues first thing in the morning, it was a consequence of that. The same thing happened this morning; I felt that my scrotum was sensitive, but I didn't pay much attention to it and continued with my day. To be honest, I didn't realize I had any problem at all. After returning home, due to my health anxiety, I began to stress and touch my scrotum in an attempt to figure out the cause. That's when the constricting feeling hit (the scrotum always retracts as if it's cold), and it troubled me for a few hours. Now it's much better; my scrotum is relaxed, I don't feel any pain, and I have no other problems, just constant thoughts about the core of this issue.

Has anyone encountered someone with chronic scrotal pain that was not of urological origin, but appeared, for example, as referred pain from nerves or the back? I've considered the possibility that due to my back issues, a nerve might be compressed, causing these sensations, or possibly an irritated nerve. What is particularly inexplicable to me is that these states come and go and are never permanent or cause any significant pain. It's primarily always about discomfort and a constricting sensation in the inner thigh. This is a big unknown for me, which is why I wanted to ask if anyone has encountered a similar form of scrotal pain that isn't permanent but comes and goes occasionally. I have some doubts about the orthopedic examination since it didn't seem particularly helpful; I respected what the specialist said, but I am still suffering without any apparent reason.",1,1739909304.0,backpain,1,1.0,False

DG: The History of the Military Invasion

In Dollet There Somewhere the Invasion of Lunatic Pandora is nowadays still visible in the Régiment of the Force Majore Town where it is clearly to be seen for example in The Architecture of the Youngian Infrastructure for instance as how all the Buildings are looking out. The Red Brick Buildings share shape and size and have been rapped over with thin layer of cement before painting with red and green.
  The Invasion took Place only 80 Years Ago but there's more to It because it has happened Sakes for About 100 Years Period of Time. Could this be explained as a contemplation of a two different Powers need to Get Control in any way for a commoner?
  Noway the locals wanna hear about how the ""Moon Boxers"" may land their lots. Not the Old Fashioned people may talk about it without getting exhausted. Impossible may it be to explain a phrase without getting furtherly held forming anonymous point of view.
 This is How he wrote an article for the newspaper in A Coffee Quarter where it was about a solid amount/quality relation of the bean. The place was about an atmosphere that belonged in An European Asphalt Jungle. It was quite the same in Berlin as in Budapest. The only difference between these different Cities was as a matter of a fact the language barrier because the folks wouldn't intuitively understand english if You got tangled over the discourse like ""No speak english"" or ""No understand"". Lots and lots would be able to help any commoner around this barrier but of course the easiest was to ignore the ""no speak"" and keep the quest going on.
  So Laguna didn't mind the cold coffee cup they would here in between the Youngian Arcitecture Areas of Geographical Nature Inhabitants call not just cold but flue aswell. People around this political surroundings that kept growing from not just the Town of Dollet or the two bigger Cities of Berlin and Budapest too from A Country to another they hadn't mentioned That Brexit didn't really remove the English Folklore from this Land.

For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? 

I have been attending my local mosque for 9 years now. They know I am a Christian.  I am a representative of Christ there. They watch me. What I do and say there influences what they think of Christians. I have interacted with hundreds of Muslims from maybe 20 Islamic countries. They have always treated me with respect except for this one time.

An American born convert to Islam started abusing and berating me for being a Christian. Demanded to know why I hadn’t converted to Islam. When I tried to walk away he kept following me demanding that I answer him. The other brothers nearby didn’t know what to do. I saw one of the brothers that I know well, and walked up to him and said to the enraged guy: “Say have you met my friend Mikael?”

Mikael caught on right away and engaged him while I went inside and found one of the leaders. I said “We have a problem outside.”

The leader followed me out and him and two brothers cornered Enraged Guy him against the building [I waked away, and let them handle it.] I heard them loudly and sternly tell him to knock it off. Enraged Guy argued with them briefly, then backed down. The Muslims were horrified by his behavior and kept apologizing to me.

Later one of the elderly founding members of the mosque came up to me and said that he was going to take the guy out for coffee and talk to him, then take us both to lunch so that we could reconcile.

Turned out to not be necessary. When I saw Enraged Guy the next week I greeted him like he was a long lost brother. He was still little suspicious, but the next week he warmed up to me, and by the third week he was my buddy.

When I was out behind the building having a smoke with some of the brothers they told me how sorry they were that that had happened. I said “You know, converts get a little carried away sometimes.” They kinda chuckled and said “yeah, they do.”",1,1739909211.0,TrueChristian,0,1.0,False

1ism63p,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1ism63p/is_this_hyatts_standard_my_frustrating_experience/,Is this Hyatt’s standard? My frustrating experience at Grand Hyatt Jeju.,"After a long redeye flight to Jeju for my birthday, my stay at Grand Hyatt Jeju quickly became disappointing. At check-in, I I learned that my room wasn’t ready. Since I had paid for club access and am a loyal Hyatt member, I asked if I could enjoy some breakfast in the Club Lounge while waiting.

The receptionist, Lynn, then escorted us to the lounge, but the experience took a turn for the worse. A colleague informed us that we can only have coffee and bread, but not the other buffet items. Worse yet, he led us to a secluded area of the lounge, far from other guests and the buffet, where we sat alone with no service staff in sight. With only the occasional passerby and curious glances from others, it felt isolating and unwelcoming.

The next day, I made myself a coffee using the Nespresso machine only to discover that there was no milk or creamer. Since I never drink my coffee black, I called Guest Service. A gentleman named Dan answered my call, and after explaining my need for milk, he curtly replied that none was available. When I asked if I could pick some up at the club lounge since I have paid for access to the Club Lounge, he told me it was closed. Shockingly, he then suggested I buy milk from a 7-Eleven! (I couldn’t believe my ears either)

Frustrated, I asked to speak with the duty manager. Peter, the duty manager, apologised and mentioned ongoing issues with local staff performance and their service attitude. He offered to check with room service about sending some creamer (even though I specifically asked for milk) to my room. By that point, it was past 11 PM and my coffee was cold. I told him it was too late—I was done with trying to enjoy a simple cup of coffee at a hotel that charges premium rates.  Unfortunately, there’s still no milk or creamer despite my feedback and request, and I will be checking-out in a few hours.

All in all, a 5-star hotel experience reduced to a 40-minute ordeal over something as basic as milk for my coffee. It’s disheartening that despite being a Hyatt Member, and paid extra for Club Access, I’m false to drink my coffee black or not drink it at all.

Has anyone else experienced such frustrating service? Let’s discuss.

I (M) work in a different department than  my coworker (F), and we have never actually talked before, but we sit relatively close to each other. We both exchange glances quite often and we frequently catch one another looking at the other and there are sometimes smiles involved. I know this could be interpreted as a coworker just being friendly, and there is a small chance that this is the case, but I confidently believe this is more than just being friendly. There is a pretty clear indication that she is interested, through her body language, eye contact, constantly going out of her way to walk by my desk, etc, and honestly I don’t think I have conveyed my interest to her as much as she has conveyed hers to me.

I haven’t been able to properly introduce myself because of the circumstances. For example, we don’t work on any of the same stuff, we are never in the break room at the same time and it doesn’t help that my manager sits near her, so it’s been difficult to actually initiate or engage in a conversation. The opportunities just really aren’t there, so my thought was to message her on Teams and say something like,

“Hey I know this is random, but I think you are very cute. Would you have any interest in getting coffee or grabbing a bite to eat with me sometime? No hard feelings if not, I just figured I’d ask because I would love to get to know you“


I know most people think it’s a terrible idea to date a coworker as the saying goes, “don’t shit where you eat/sleep”, but I will not be working for this company that much longer so I want to shoot my shot. I’m in my 20’s and life is too short to not take risks and obviously if I get rejected, I will own it and not pursue anything further.

Any and all advice is appreciated! It would be helpful to her feedback from a woman’s perspective if they were in my coworkers shoes. How would you respond to a coworkers message like the one above?

For past three days I used a different cup under my aeropress, and it seems like the two fit so well, the air in the cup is sealed(a little). So, for this cup, I need to press harder on the aeropress. I try to keep the rate of coffee drip the same as I used to with previous cup. The pressure needed is especially higher just before and through the hissing phase. The coffee tastes a big stronger. The coffee puck I get is very clean, similar to an espresso. 
Has anyone had a similar experience? Is this good for coffee? Would it affect the longevity of my aeropress? Any chance I might break it and burn myself someday?

1islrib,https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileAL/comments/1islrib/mobile_mayor_madness_2025/,Mobile Mayor Madness 2025,"I apologize if my last post caused anybody to have a bad day. If I want to persuade people, then I have a self-imposed responsibility in this instance not to conflate a serious matter with my personal distastes. After a good night’s sleep and a cup of coffee, I pictured a tired family upset at the breakfast table with their kids, and part of me felt guilty. I took down the post due to my overly irreverent tone.

That being said, when you enter the political arena, you subject yourself to examination. Before you are trusted to lead us, the electorate should be able to vet you. Your character and business interests are totally fair game. 

Why? Because if you are elected, you will be in a position to make decisions that affect your business interests. Not only that, but you will also  be ethically bound to put the best interests of the city and its voters over your own personal business interests (aka the financial interests of your own spouse and children). It’s called a conflict of interest. 

For example, let’s say hypothetically that a tax cut is proposed for new businesses. Mr. Cheriogotis comes out in favor of it, and then Greer’s saves $10 million building 2 new stores in the county over the next few years. He says he’s helping to incentivize commerce, but really the voters could have used those tax dolors to fund their crumbling educational institutions, infrastructure, or public works. Meanwhile he’s got a fancy new hunting camp and some shiny new toys. 

This is why politicians divest themselves of their business interests when they are elected to office. For example, Mayor Robin LeJeune of Daphne sold his longtime restaurant, Market by the Bay, when he was elected mayor. Now if his wealthy campaign contributors call him and say “Robin, talk to the planning commission and get this property re-zoned for me…” he at least would not be directly putting money into his own pocket by say for instance, re-zoning a property near his which would increase the property value and revenue of his personal business. That doesn’t mean he can’t, hypothetically, help wealthy campaign benefactors turn Daphne into one monolithic monopoly development with no soul. It just means he can’t personally profit from it (at least in a direct/visible way). Even Donald Trump, after the 2016 election, placed his business assets into a trust managed by his sons. 

I would hope the Cheriogotis family has considered this. It’s not impossible for business-owning families to hold political office, but it is morally imperative that they significantly distance themselves from their business interests if elected. There is far too much potential for abuse and corruption if they allow these spheres of their life to overlap. What does that look like for Mrs. Greer Cheriogotis? If her husband is elected, she should become a passive shareholder in her company and focus on helping him improve the lives of Mobilians. If she could commit to doing so, then she would greatly improve this voter’s perception of her and her husband’s campaign. As far as I know, she has not done so. 

I didn’t say that very well before, and I’m sorry if my post came across as a personal attack. I want to draw attention to this moral dilemma. I am not some shadow operative of another candidate. I’m just a registered voter who’s sick of corruption, abuse, and politicians conflating status with substance. Elected positions are not thrones designed to passed from one chosen member of the establishment to another. We need leaders with proven qualities. I asked if Mr. Cheriogotis had those, because if so, I would consider voting for him despite my current perception of him. One Reddit user said they heard secondhand that the candidate has a reputation in the legal world as a conscientious judge during his 6-year career. Personally, I would like a little more convincing on that issue and the conflicting interests issue. So as of now, I’m still leaning NO on Nodine and Cheriogotis due to ethical concerns for both and lack of experience for the latter.

I would love to find out more about the other candidates! Connie Hudson. Lawrence Battiste. Barbara Drummond. Maybe Paul Prine. Why should we or should we not vote for them? Please let us all know about your knowledge and experience with them. The Press Register is closed, most of the AL.com journalists were laid off, and the TV news has become one giant commercial.

I am a full time employee and work for a company (""COMPANY"") in England, employed for 5 years so far and on salary. COMPANY I work for operates in speciality coffee and my job is essentially about going out to our CUSTOMERS (other companies that use our coffee) and servicing their own (or leased) equipment (coffee machines to be more specific).

Now to the question - today I was sent by COMPANY to service a coffee machine at one of their CUSTOMER and shortly after arriving there a few of CUSTOMER employees started smoking in the workplace. To clarify it was a restaurant and the place where they smoked was at the time completely enclosed with no ventilation. It was a ""shisa lounge"" but if there was any retractable roof or not, it was not open at the time and I could smell the smoke far too well. This irritated me but I was really not in a mood to discuss the issue with any of them as I was not sure about my legal standing in the whole matter, therefore I would like to ask here first.

I am aware that smoking in the workplace is generally prohibited. Can I refuse to work in such a workplace? I am not going to ask someone else's employee not to smoke at their workplace because that is none of my business, I would rather just refuse to continue work there and leave.

I am going to discuss this matter with my manager and our HR later this week as this is second time  (different CUSTOMER though) something like that happened and I am getting bit upset.

Any advice or snippets of what law to look at to get me prepared would be appreciated.

Also, can such as establishment be reported to the authorities for this and potentially breaches of other regulations (PSSR 2000 for example)?",1,1739908039.0,LegalAdviceUK,1,1.0,False

I’ve been dating my boyfriend (24m)  for about two years now and over time, I’ve grown really close to his mom, sisters, and even his dad. I’m a (23F) and recently, his mom started sending me Instagram reels through Messages, and eventually, she requested to follow me. I was hesitant to follow her back because I knew that, out of her 450+ posts, there were likely some old pictures of my boyfriend and his ex. Being an overthinker, I didn’t want to deal with the emotions that might come up if I saw them.

Yesterday, she officially requested me, and I accepted. I finally went through her Instagram, and to my surprise, I didn’t see any pictures of him and his ex. I assumed she or my boyfriend had deleted them all. Later that night, my boyfriend and I were looking at her Instagram together, and he suddenly pointed out one of those old photos, saying, “OMG, I need to delete that.” He told me he’d ask his mom to take it down when he got home.

After he left, his mom deleted the picture, and I felt relieved. It showed me that she was on my side and didn’t mind removing something that made me uncomfortable, which made me feel good because I know she really likes me.

However, today I was hanging out with his sister, and while we were grabbing coffee, she casually mentioned that their family had a whole conversation about that picture the morning of the night I found out. She explained that my boyfriend already knew it was there before last night. That threw me off because he made it seem like it was the first time he had seen it and acted like he was just as surprised as I was.

Now I’m feeling angry because it feels like he wasn’t upfront with me and made me believe he was unaware of the picture when, in reality, he knew about it all along. Why not just tell your mom in the moment like, hey can you just delete that I don’t need that up bc I don’t care to know my ex’s photo is up on your Instagram?

I kind of feel like sleeping AT ALL before the car pick up would be a mistake, so plan to sleep maybe a little on the Mumbai-Dubai flight....but for those 5 hours in Dubai in the lounge, am I drinking coffee and working, or am I napping in a corner? I am certain that I would be sleeping for a good amount of the 16 hour Dubai->EWR.  Any hints would be welcome! ",0,1739907656.0,travel,6,0.5,False

She said she would ask the higher level of management. I never heard anything back. I don’t know if she addressed this or not.

I (26f) have been working for an alternative-style nursing facility (Think nursing homes in Florida) for nearly three years and have been through the wringer. 2 CNA/CMA's per building and 1 nurse to go between the 2 intensive buildings with up to 12 residents at any given time. The assisted side is just a CNA/CMA and they call the nurse if help is needed. Night shift is 1 CNA/CMA per building and still 1 nurse that floats.

TLDR: My job as me at my wits end and my coworker has again asked me to cover so she can stay with her child who is fighting a mental health breakdown. (more context at the bottom)

Background that may be relevant worked on the intensive care side for 1.5 years and after working an entire month with maybe 4 days off I was told I had a ""poor attitude"" and was put on a probationary period on the assisted living side of the facility. I got through the probationary period but the damage was done on my body and how they saw me. Until the breaking point and probationary period, I loved my job. I enjoyed the people I worked with and cared for. It was hard and dedicated work that I enjoyed. However, due to staff shortages and nobody wanting to help cover night shifts I was often asked to take on extra shifts. I took on what I could and declined when I needed breaks, but because I was able to take so many on I essentially ""shot myself in the foot"" because every time they needed someone to cover everyone told them to ""ask Jump\_Ok!""

Last August, I took some time off and when I came back I was ""Jokingly"" told by my dayshift coworker to ""never take vacation again."" It sucked because I had enjoyed my time off and wanted to try and take another one next year. During my time in the intensive care side I had tweeked my back causing constant pain if I didn't rest once in a while. After transferring to the assisted side it got a little better, but since said trip an increased pressure/workload from upper management has caused my pain to increase drastically. It is to the point I can't wash dishes, cook or clean for 20-30 minutes without feeling intense stabbing pain in my hips and back. In October, certain residents began complaining that I'm ""not doing my job"" or ""I'm not cleaning their room right"". This is just what I hear with no constructive criticism to guide me just management growling, ""Do better!"" So I again got put on an ""improvement plan"" for all aspects of my job. I have tried asking all my residents what I can do better and they say I am doing fine or they complain their piping hot coffee is ""too cold""/their iced tea is too hot.

The tipping point came last night after an all staff meeting for just our building. Long story short, we need more improvements and they want us to do more without any extra help. I was told after the meeting to stay and the head manager said ""If you don't improve you are at risk of losing your job."" I explained my health concerns and how doctors are just telling me to ""lose weight"" and send me on my way. I am trying my best with what non-exsistant resources I have to improve but it's not helping. After the meeting I decided I was not going to cover shifts and just focus on getting through until I can either get a doctor to help me or I find a sit-down job. I was contacted not 2 hours after that meeting and was asked to come in and finish a shift because the other night shift coworker's daughter was having a mental breakdown and she needed to get home. I had been drinking since I got home and explained I couldn't. I was contacted by that coworker again asking for me to cover because she doesn't want to leave her alone today. I understand needing to make sure your kid is ok, but this is probably the 4-5th time they have had this in the past 4 months. I was again the first person they called asking me to cover. WIBTA if I told them no?

Until recently, things changed. i guess we are over?","hi guys. just wanted to gather some thoughts and insights on the situation that i’m currently facing, i’m completely helpless at this stage bc i’ve done all i could but to no avail. 

M33 and i (29F) have been talking for a while. we met through a work event on christmas eve last year and stayed in contact on instagram ever since.

honestly i thought everything was going well. we had so much to talk about. altho we have never gotten a chance to hangout / date since both of us have extremely hectic schedules and have been working weekends, we do have some short face time over a few occasions of gettin and passin stuffs to one another. 

on one occasion, i actually bought him some perk-me-up for work, eg. coffee and drinks. and on another occasion he actually delivered lunch and homemade barley over to my workplace while i was having a really bad ulcer.
and uk, that was a really sweet gesture and i truly appreciate it a lot.

eventually we did set a tentative date the following month (aka this month) to meet. however the plans, never came to fruition.

so basically on lunar new year’s eve he told me he’s feeling unwell and was seeing the doctor. and so being the kind of person i was, i wanted to show some care and concern for him, especially during this season where he’s gotta manage the cooking… preparation for his entire family, and i’m just genuinely worried for him and truly wanted him to recover fast and recuperate well. 

and so i actually prepared a care pack w meds.. supplements and asked for his address so i could send it over. 

i understand that i might have neglected the fact that he’s uncomfortable w me coming over to deliver stuffs. but i never ever had the intention of bothering him. (i just wanted to leave the stuff at his doorstep thats all)

anyways long story short, i did managed to meet him at the void deck and passed him all dat stuff. 

but ever since then, i noticed he’s been growing cold and distant. he doesn’t text nor check in w me like how he usually does.

he tells me lunar new year is his busiest period. 
so i told myself fine. ill let him have his own space to do what he needs to, to recover, rest up etc. and over the two weeks, i hear nothing from him. 

so back to the tentative date dat we’re supposed to meet (last saturday). i thought since he hasn’t reach out, ill do so. 

and turns out he just tells me he wont be able to make it bc he’ll have to care for a relative who’s feelin unwell. does it mean that if i dont reach out, he doesn’t even bother to inform me that he couldn’t make it? 

so then i asked him to let me know once things are better and when he’s able to meet bc i have something that i wanted to tell him. 

but after which he just kept pressing on asking what was it. and subsequently just ghosted me.

guys i’m absolutely helpless. like whats gg on. honestly what i wanted was a talk between the both of us so i could share my thoughts and at the same time, clarify. like if its me who made him felt uncomfortable in any way that i show love, i’d gladly apologise. but apparently now he’s completely avoidant and there’s no way i could meet or talk to him.

i guess we are over? :’(

I (26f) have been working for an alternative-style nursing facility (Think nursing homes in Florida) for nearly three years and have been through the wringer. 2 CNA/CMA's per building and 1 nurse to go between the 2 intensive buildings with up to 12 residents at any given time. The assisted side is just a CNA/CMA and they call the nurse if help is needed. Night shift is 1 CNA/CMA per building and still 1 nurse that floats.

TLDR: My job as me at my wits end and my coworker has again asked me to cover so she can stay with her child who is fighting a mental health breakdown. (more context at the bottom)

Background that may be relevant worked on the intensive care side for 1.5 years and after working an entire month with maybe 4 days off I was told I had a ""poor attitude"" and was put on a probationary period on the assisted living side of the facility. I got through the probationary period but the damage was done on my body and how they saw me. Until the breaking point and probationary period, I loved my job. I enjoyed the people I worked with and cared for. It was hard and dedicated work that I enjoyed. However, due to staff shortages and nobody wanting to help cover night shifts I was often asked to take on extra shifts. I took on what I could and declined when I needed breaks, but because I was able to take so many on I essentially ""shot myself in the foot"" because every time they needed someone to cover everyone told them to ""ask Jump\_Ok!""

Last August, I took some time off and when I came back I was ""Jokingly"" told by my dayshift coworker to ""never take vacation again."" It sucked because I had enjoyed my time off and wanted to try and take another one next year. During my time in the intensive care side I had tweeked my back causing constant pain if I didn't rest once in a while. After transferring to the assisted side it got a little better, but since said trip an increased pressure/workload from upper management has caused my pain to increase drastically. It is to the point I can't wash dishes, cook or clean for 20-30 minutes without feeling intense stabbing pain in my hips and back. In October, certain residents began complaining that I'm ""not doing my job"" or ""I'm not cleaning their room right"". This is just what I hear with no constructive criticism to guide me just management growling, ""Do better!"" So I again got put on an ""improvement plan"" for all aspects of my job. I have tried asking all my residents what I can do better and they say I am doing fine or they complain their piping hot coffee is ""too cold""/their iced tea is too hot.

The tipping point came last night after an all staff meeting for just our building. Long story short, we need more improvements and they want us to do more without any extra help. I was told after the meeting to stay and the head manager said ""If you don't improve you are at risk of losing your job."" I explained my health concerns and how doctors are just telling me to ""lose weight"" and send me on my way. I am trying my best with what non-exsistant resources I have to improve but it's not helping. After the meeting I decided I was not going to cover shifts and just focus on getting through until I can either get a doctor to help me or I find a sit-down job. I was contacted not 2 hours after that meeting and was asked to come in and finish a shift because the other night shift coworker's daughter was having a mental breakdown and she needed to get home. I had been drinking since I got home and explained I couldn't. I was contacted by that coworker again asking for me to cover because she doesn't want to leave her alone today. I understand needing to make sure your kid is ok, but this is probably the 4-5th time they have had this in the past 4 months. I was again the first person they called asking me to cover.

1islaip,https://www.reddit.com/r/starseeds/comments/1islaip/how_do_you_use_your_stardust_advice_from_a/,How Do You Use Your Stardust?   Advice from a Conversation,"I've spent my life pondering the same things, who am I and my purpose.

I've been where you are. I've felt as you feel.

I believe a piece of me will always be in crisis, forcing me to experiment and try new things... wondering if I've missed something important.

I found that I had to start journaling to figure it out.

Start with what you KNOW, from your experience. And then spend your life exploring who you are.

Let me give you an example, because that advice likely seems too simple to be true.

Here is an example journal I could write right now.

I exist.  
I'm sitting at my office, wondering about a stranger on the other side of the world. 

My intention is to help her live an amazing life. I don't think that can be done in a small interaction, but I hope it somehow will.

I believe I'm riding on a giant rock, flying through space. The only thing significant about this rock, whatsoever, is that I am on it.

I share this rock with others, called humans, that seem to also be experiencing life, awareness, conciseness.

Some of these humans have hurt me. Some deeply. I didn't like the hurt. I want to avoid the hurt in the future. I have to be cautious about other humans. They may not be good and safe.

Why am I here? Is there purpose in me flying on this rock through space?

Stars and planets flash and break apart in space. They burn up. Stars burning up don't impact me or cause me harm. Other humans and my decisions cause me harm.

I can't leave this rock. So whatever my purpose is, it has to be here... on this rock. And my purpose doesn't matter to the other stars. Or to the moon.

Everyone around me is always busy... I don't think I matter much to them. They are busy doing other things. They only notice me if I take something from them, or give them something.

I'm hungry. I like coffee.

A day without coffee is not as good as a day with coffee.

Some things make my life better. And some things make my life worse. I have preferences.

A good day is when I make someone else's existence better. Sometimes they show me with words, other times their actions, but in general I get a vibe from others. It is a feeling of who they are, and who we are together.

I like it when that vibe is positive. When I'm not the cause of their hurt. Hurt is bad.



All of that is just true at this moment.

**Advice:**

Do that for a few weeks. See what patterns you discover.

I've been journaling for more than a decade. Searching. Being curious. Thinking, creating, playing.

Now at 45 I am incredibly fulfilled and happy. I enjoy much of my life. I've collected other humans that I've also found to be good and positive in my life.

I enjoy helping others. Enjoying helping others means I've gotten good at seeing patterns in the lives of others. These patterns allowed me to start businesses that helped people get what they wanted faster. They pay me for helping. It makes me feel like I'm good at my purpose.

Recently I discovered my next purpose and I'm working on pursuing it. I'm not very good at things the new purpose requires and I'm trying to figure out how to overcome my shortcomings... as I did when I was younger.

Stopping there. I welcome questions.  
  
**But to summarize...**

Your purpose is your own to discover.

No other human can tell you what your purpose is. Your life is the discovery and pursuit of your purpose.

You will have to overcome many obstacles. They include: Yourself. Your family. The rules that everyone has told you to obey. The resources available to you. Your past self.

You, random stranger,  are made up of the same elements that stars are made of.

Some stars use what they are made of to burn bright.

1isl96d,https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/1isl96d/paying_for_women_a_charity_not_an_investment/,"Paying for Women: A Charity, Not an Investment","A lot of men have this false assumption that paying for women will make a consequential difference, but the reality is, it’s negligible. Unless you’re dropping serious money, you’re not going to change much. Women are shallow and selfish, if she doesn’t desire you, she won’t suddenly like you just because you’re nice to her and buy her drinks or dinner.

Think about it. Women claim they want guys who bring them flowers and treat them well, yet they chase and hook up with dudes who don’t even do the bare minimum. The guy who actually cares, who takes her on dates, buys her gifts, gets laughed at and rejected, or he’s only used for his resources after she’s out of her prime and the guy she desires doesn’t want her anymore. She only wants flowers from the guy she desires. And even then, it doesn’t matter. the guy she desires gets her best whether he buys flowers or not. Women might say they want to be treated well, but their actions prove it’s not a dealbreaker.

The truth is, women love the attention and resources men give them, but they don’t usually like the men who provide it. That’s why a woman can have a guy taking her out, spending money on her, treating her like a queen, then turn around and sleep with a guy who hasn’t spent a dime or made any effort. Women don’t reward effort; they reward status and attraction. And if you’re not already the type of guy she wants, spending won’t change that.

I’ve had almost the same success with lunch dates as I have with coffee dates. I’m an average guy, so I still have to put in effort, effort that the guy she desires doesn’t, but in the end, I still succeed. This proves that all the extra spending and investment don’t matter. If she wants you, she wants you. If she doesn’t, your money is just a temporary benefit for her before she moves on to the guy she actually desires.

Hell, simps investing in women is just how women stroke their egos and compensate for the lack of attention the guy she desires doesn’t give them. That’s why most men get one or two dates before being ghosted, she was just using you. I figured this out early on, thanks to a woman who actually wanted to sleep with me. She showed me the reality.

There was a guy making an effort, buying her drinks, guess who got those drinks? Me. Guess who she went home with that night? Me. I’ve even had a woman hook up with me right after going on a lunch date with some other guy. She let him spend money on her, enjoyed the meal, used his effort and time, and then gave herself to me for free. That’s how the game works.

All this paying-for-women nonsense is gaslighting. Do you think the guy she desires has to do any of this? Women literally show you that they’re okay with mistreatment as long as it’s from the guy she desires. And you think investing matters? If you really want to invest in something that works on women, get a gym membership. Build yourself up physically and socially instead of wasting money on women who don’t respect it.

Don’t waste your money on pussy, that shit is cheap and can’t really be achieved by being nice or putting in genuine effort. You’re not paying for her; you’re paying for the guy she desires. You’re doing all the hard work while he reaps the benefits. Paying for women should be charity, do it if you really want to, but just know that, like most charities, your money is probably being used by someone else.",0,1739906924.0,PurplePillDebate,14,0.29,False
1isl95z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Victoriasecretbeauty/comments/1isl95z/anyone_else/,Anyone else?,"Sorry this is so long.  I'll probably delete it tbh.  But I need to get this off of my chest, and I can't lie.. I'm hoping for a bit of supportive feedback from you guys💔

I have been a typical VS customer for years. Getting a mist when I'm out...  undergarments here and there when I've been running low on things. However, the last couple years since losing my brother, things were really hard.  I started shopping online more and more. I bought a year's supply of Nespresso and BBW candles. I started collecting perfumes, fragrance mists, and lotions as well. (The coffee is sealed with nitrogen, the mists will last about as long.  It's the lotions that really made me start questioning my shopping habits. I have realized I can't use them all up before they go bad at this point.) So, yeah.. I guess I have probably been using online shopping as a crutch. (Not saying everyone does this, I'm just recognizing this is happening for me, personally)

And today, I've reached an impasse.

Little rewind....at first, it was great, blind-buying scents and looking forward to getting my package.... getting that rush of finally smelling a new scent. Each new scent in my collection made me feel like a tiny need was being filled. Like... oh, this scent is so nice and *will be perfect for_____(insert mood/ season/ event of your choice). And tbh, most of them just go unused. I only reach for a fraction of my collection regularly. I've become a total overconsumer. (No hate! Absolutely if doing that brings you joy, then that's awesome, but for me.. it's starting to become the opposite.)

Rant within a rant : VS seems to be splitting up shipments more often and orders are wrong so frequently that my excitement for packages has turned to straight up dread.  It's becoming embarrassing to receive a package because of the split orders and re -shipments. And they send the wrong thing so often. Sometimes, they send empty boxes.  I've actually received a completely empty black bag before with just an invoice and one piece of cardboard backing. (No tears or rips in bag... that's how it was sent!)

Idk if anyone is still reading this, but today was the final straw for me. I had ordered a couple of backup mists for the sale (more that I didn't need) and received a totally wrong item.  Of course the one they didn't send was the one I like most but still, I thought...I order enough, I'll just get a refund instead of having them ship yet another thing to my house. Well. Nope.. they won't help me. I am a Gold member just to be clear so that means I've spent ALOT there over the past couple years.  They were trying to tell me I need to send back the wrong item that I didn't even order and then they can give me a refund for the item they never sent. I know they do this because people scam them but I'm honest to a fault. I could have just said I didn't get anything at all, but I was honest and told them about their mistake. Guys let's be real... if ordering online said: ""may get wrong item just ship it back and we'll send the right item"" then no one would ever order!

So anyway.... it's just not worth it for me to send it back just to get what I rightfully paid for, and tbh I would have paid 6.95 to not have that CS interaction.  It's -10 f outside right now. I live 20 miles from the nearest shipping station and 100 miles from a store. I order on-line for a reason. I'll take my losses, donate this incorrect spray somewhere, and I'm taking this as a sign.  I don't need more VS stuff.  I don't need more headaches.   I'm done! I'm going to shop my own collection from now on and get out of this fomo buying culture while I can. Again, not knocking anyone for buying things and if it's bringing you joy then absolutely do you!

I almost didn't post this. I might delete it like I was saying above.. but if this helps anyone feel less alone or to make a change... do what I did today and delete the app. I feel a little sad, tbh.  I feel a little empty. But why should I feel that way from simply deleting a shopping app?? I'm taking responsibility for my anxiety in this situation. If I'm not happy ordering anymore.. then I should be done, right? 

I've loved sharing my thoughts on scents here and chatting with some of you. I wish you all joy and good things in life, and I'll probably pop in from time to time to discuss older scents or items already in my collection.. but no more new new for this gal, at least not for many years. The scents they are putting out have been getting lighter with each subsequent drop anyway, so maybe it's a good time for this hiatus.

If anyone has any positive feedback or encouragement, I'd absolutely love to hear it. Feeling bummed but determined.

She suggested that I should “get out there.” At the time I was 23 year old female that lived in Texas and was mostly focused on college. I had one past relationship but that’s it.  At first I told Lucy no but she convinced me to download tinder. When I downloaded tinder I met this guy that I’ll call Andrew. He was 26 male but lived in and had about the same interest as me but lived in Canda. Lucy told me he looked like the one so I swiped left and we were a match. We began to talk and he seemed really nice. After a three mouths we started dating. After we started dating we started talking more and after about two years I started wanting to meet. Andrew said he wanted to meet as well but he kept making excuses why we shouldn’t meet. I would tell you the stupid excuses he told me but this is already long. I knew what Andrew looked like since we FaceTimed a lot and he always looked like his pictures so I knew he wasn’t cat fishing be so I wondered why he didn’t want to meet.. So me and Lucy planed to go the Canda and track Andrew down. When we got there I started looking for little clues of where he would be at like his post on facebook or the backgrounds of our FaceTimes until we find a coffee shop that he usually went to. I was so excited. I asked a worker there a women that looked a bit younger if a man that fit Andrew’s description had been there recently when she asks me if I know him. I tell her yes and that I’m visiting him. She tells me that her brother fits that description and says that if I want a relationship I should stay away. I stand there confused and ask her what do you mean. Not telling that we are dating. She then tells me that he is taken and that I would be a home weaker. I stood there surprised as Lucy was getting angry. I pull out my phone and show her a picture of Andrew and ask if that’s her brother. I was crossing my fingers hoping that she would say no but she didn’t she nodded. I began to cry. She then said don’t tell me you are seeing him? I nod still crying. Lucy then says  that we have been dating for almost 2 years. Since I don’t want to call her worker the whole time I’ll call her Bell. Bell then says that she should tell his wife about this. When me and Lucy heard the word wife we freaked out. Lucy yelled and said call her and tell her to come here now without Andrew. After what felt like 30 minutes the wife that I’ll call Zoey showed up. She talked to Bell for bit as they talked Zoey kept watching me.  They both walk up to me and Lucy. Zoey starts to tear up and ask if I have really been dating her husband. I began to cry and nod. Bell then says she has to go and she gets off in a hour. After she left Zoey sits across from be  with tears in her eyes. We started talking and began hanging out. We all started distancing ourselves away from him but we have no idea what else to do..

I upgraded my grinder last week from a c2 Timemore (hand grinder) to Opus grinder. I noticed that when I pour coffee beans, I get less coffee in return. Like I grind 22g of coffee but at the other side, I get around 17g. I have to spank this machine 3 times to get around 21g of coffee. Since this is my first electric grinder, I wasn't sure if it is normal. 

I also cleaned the grinder but still had the same issue. So I wouldn't say cleanness was a problem. 

Do any of you have the same issue? is this normal or should I just exchange it in the store?",1,1739906825.0,FellowProducts,1,1.0,False

A just brewed pot of coffee spilled on me while working and caused a large burn on my leg. It burned right through my clothes and 2 layers of skin. I ran to find my manager who put some burn cream on it and wrapped it up. She said she didn’t know if an accident report needed filled out and that she would ask the higher-ups. I never heard back about it. 

That was Friday. It’s now Sunday and still hurting a lot. It actually hurts even worse now. It hurts to stand and put weight on it and to walk sometimes. I still need to apply burn cream at least once a day and wrap it. It’s gotten even more red since it happened. 

I told my manger today that it still hurts and looks even more red than before. She just told me to clean it and keep putting cream on it even though that’s what i’ve been doing. No paperwork was ever filled out. It’s been wrapped and forgotten about. I didn’t get any worker’s comp. I didn’t ask because i’ve never been injured at a job before and didn’t know how that worked and if it even applied to this situation.

For the same price or maybe a bit more than KHC, you will get something that is significantly better in quality, that has been freshly roasted, its worlds apart.

1isl3qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingsmoking/comments/1isl3qo/how_i_managed_to_quit_smoking_after_10_years/,How I Managed to Quit Smoking After 10 Years,"Like most people, I started smoking at a very young age, when I was 16 years old. I wanted to fit in with my friends. I was young and stupid, I thought I couldn’t get addicted. I had no limits, I smoked 60 cigarettes a day, and if I went out drinking with friends, that number could go up to 80.

Because of that, I had serious health problems. From stomach issues, bloating, acid reflux, diarrhea, to constant fatigue, random irritability, and sleeping problems. I would wake up in the middle of the night just to smoke because withdrawal would hit me even in my sleep.

I tried to quit six times. The first five attempts were a disaster, I couldn’t last more than a few days. The sixth time, I managed to stay smoke-free for six months, but then I made the mistake of lighting a cigarette while on vacation with my girlfriend. Overnight, I was back to 60 cigarettes a day.

For a long time, I didn’t even try to quit again. I thought there was no point in torturing myself because I would fail anyway. I started to believe I would be a smoker forever. But eventually, I decided to try again. Only this time, I wanted to do things differently. There was no point in repeating the same methods that had already failed.

The first thing I did, which helped me a lot, was educating myself about smoking. I started reading about what’s inside cigarettes, how they affect my body and brain, and why I was feeling the way I did. Once I understood how nicotine addiction works, I was able to recognize my mistakes from previous attempts.

The second thing I did was changing the way I thought about smoking. This is extremely important, even if it sounds silly. Every time I felt scared and thought, ""How will I handle stress without cigarettes?"" I immediately stopped myself and reminded myself, ""You know that’s not true, cigarettes don’t actually help."" If I thought about drinking coffee without a cigarette, I stopped myself and said, ""Your sense of taste and smell will recover, and you’ll enjoy coffee even more."" For every negative or fearful thought, I interrupted myself and replaced it with something positive.

Because the truth is, quitting smoking has no downsides, only benefits.

The next thing I did was not waiting for the perfect moment, because I knew it doesn’t exist. The ""perfect moment"" we look for is just fear talking, a reason to delay quitting.

I made a list of my triggers and for each one, I had a plan for what I would do instead of smoking. Everything was written down and easily accessible.

I threw away all my cigarettes, lighters, and ashtrays, and told myself that no matter what happens, no matter how hard it gets, I will NOT smoke.

I won’t lie and say it was easy, but it was definitely easier than before. This time, I knew exactly what I wanted, and I knew that giving up was not an option.

Up until now, I scanned 35mm film on mounted slides with my Epson V850 Pro at home. But later this year, I’ll travel to the USA to meet up with photographers and to scan their slides on location, and for that I’m looking for the best possible and affordable option to scan those images, since we all know that drum scans are out of the equation.

I heard about digitizing film through a dia duplicator (at least that’s how it’s called in Germany), which is basically a device that can hold up to three mounted slides, being attached to the body of a camera. Some say this is the fastest and most portable way, but they claim that the image quality will not be as good as with a flatbed scanner.

What’s your professional opinion on that and what specific cameras, lenses and light sources would you recommend in order to get an image quality suitable for higher quality photo books (not high-end though)?

In a situation where one looks at someone's messages and finds something wrong, who is the asshole. Both of us, I guess?

I am sure this is nothing new. TLDR is I accidentally saw some somewhat old messages on my partners iPad that reveal an omission of truth if not an outright lie. Am I the asshole for snooping?

Not looking for advice, I know the right move, but for context: I recently accidentally saw something on my partners iPad, some oldish messages with a guy that she had gone out on maybe one date with a long time ago, nothing came of it as far as I know, but they remained friends. There happened to be an open tab on her screen which I stumbled upon while flailing with screen. I am an android user and I am not fluent with apple interface, really. I ended up just happening to see this contact open and I am embarrassed to say I clicked on it because at that point I was a bit concerned/curious. I am not trying to defend myself but it happened very fast and I just felt like I couldn't look away. I need it to be known that I really trust her-I think she is really a good, honest person and I feel very loved. She maybe thought that her interactions with this guy were innocent enough not to warrant mentioning. The last message was from a few months ago, well after our relationship was clearly VERY serious. They talk about getting a coffee or a walk in but then the conversation ends. She is at several points very clear about defining boundaries and he actually totally concurs, i.e. he's not even interested. Like, on appearances nothing at all happened between them, but she still hid these interactions with the guy from me well after we had defined the relationship and even after we had said ""I love you."" We defined the relationship about 8 months before she told me she loved me. In between those two pretty monumental moments, she actually went to his house to watch a movie (she had told me that she was seeing a movie with a friend, I didn't ask for details because I didn't think I needed to, and also don't want to come off as jealous...but also didn't know she was going to a dudes house to watch it alone with him). I can see in their interaction that it is plutonic. I just don't know why she would hide it from me. I feel like the options are a) she in fact did have something to hide, b) she's afraid I would react a certain way. But we are very kind and gentle people, we are very sensitive to each other. It pains me to think she would be afraid of how I would take that. I'm feeling a little burned and kind of thinking that just EVERYONE lies...but anyhow, am I the asshole?",1,1739906288.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

First off, I will not apologize for who I am. I have spent too much of my life hiding behind masks of varying degrees. I had a new friend recently help me to see just how much I'm missing out on by doing so, and I'm not going to do that any longer. 

So here i am, I all my glory. 

I'm 37. Wow. Where do the years go? Well, if you made the same mistakes I did, you got a little too much into drinking in college and wound up wasting about a decade just scraping by, doing the bare minimum. Lesson learned.

Now, though, I think I'm doing good. I've gone from feeling like I've wasted my life to instead trying to just enjoy it.

How? Well, I like to say my main hobby is collecting hobbies! Recently I got into fountain pens and inks (oh, so many pretty colors!) and I'm kinda teaching myself to sew. Last year I tried my hand at making chainmail jewelery. 

But if you want to talk things I keep coming back to, the main one is reading. I enjoy most genres, but classic sci-fi is my go-to. Aasimov, Vonnegut, Arthur C. Clarke are all in heavy rotation. Sci-fi TV shows and movies, too. 

I enjoy gardening, when I'm able to. Living in an apartment limits my ability, but hopefully I will one day have a place with a yard I can turn into a food forest. Or at the very least a decent garden to can from.

I'm very much a homebody. Sitting next to each other reading our books silently is as much quality time to me as doing some activity together. That being said, I also enjoy hiking through the woods and just spending time outdoors. Not so much in the winter, though. Winter is for hot coffee or cocoa and curling up under a pile of blankets. 

Whew. I think that's the longest post I've ever created. I'd like to think I have a lot more to add here, but I'm afraid if I try it'll just turn into some sort of rambling stream of consciousness post with no clear point.

Oh! Right! The point of my post! Ideally I'm looking for friends. But if one of those new friendships turns into something more, well, I wouldn't complain. But I'm not going into this looking for that. ",7,1739906262.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

Alternately, I guess I could order 10 of their 40g sample packs and brew with my Mugen.  Hard to screw up beans with it and it always produces at least a very good cup

I have probably read 10 hours of things between Reddit and other things to try and remedy my problem. I had a painter paint my bedroom 3 months ago. 2 walls were a tan color and 2 were red (yes not smart) and they painted it white. Used Sherwin Williams primer and paint, very high quality and low voc's. The paint smell went away after a week but I cannot sleep in there, Got burning in lungs, throat, eyes etc. I am thinking from my research that VOC's got trapped as they didnt let coats of primer dry before putting more on? I have had the SW rep out twice, he just left again saying he didnt know that they could try a paint they have that is supposed to lower VOC's. He had no idea. Does anyone think this will work? It is obviously highly frustrating as it has been 3 months since it was painted. I have tried everything I have read haha - baking soda, vinegar, heating it up, shutting it up, opening it up, windows open, fans, air purifiers, ceiling fan, coffee, onions, spider plant.

I'm flying in early March to hopefully make a pick. Thought I'd post here in case somebody's sitting on something that's just right :)

I'm an observant Jew, but not so much that I won't bike or drive to shul if I have to. Minneapolis, St. Paul, and St. Louis Park fit best for those needs, but otherwise I work fully remotely so no commute considerations.

Rent budget's in the range of $1,000 - $1,800. Willing to pay more on the upper end for a closer match and lower end for a ""eh, that'll do"" match.

In the apartment, I'm hoping for:

* Big enough for a slightly distinct work area. 1BR with a large great room area, 1BR with den, or 2BR options all would work
* Private balcony/patio. Ideally the kind that you can really stretch out on - room for a couple chairs and a table, semi-enclosed, somewhat protected from direct overhead rain - as opposed to the ones that are just exposed projections from a building
* On-site parking for one car
* Quiet - away from loud music, bars, parties. Activity and bustle in the day is OK, but I really want to live somewhere the streets are quiet and calm after sunset
* Some Metro Transit service within a 10-15 minute walk - I'd like to take transit to downtown activities, Twins games, and the like, doesn't have to be super high frequency but has to be all day into the evening (not like express/rush hour only)
* Walking distance to some places to grab a coffee/takeout is a nice to have

Very open to all ages and vintages of housing stock, so if you have something or know of something you think will fit, I'd love to hear from you!

**Join A Public League To Prove You're The Best Of Reddit**

Want to prove to your friends/family/co-workers that you know Survivor better than them? 

Well you can now do just that at http://tribal-council.com. We allow you to create your own private fantasy Survivor league so you can play against only people you know and/or invite. Just sign up, sign in, click on ""Create Private League"", and then send the league code to whoever you want to join. We'll take care of the rest.

Haven't been able to convince your friends just how amazing Survivor is? That's okay, join one of our public leagues.

Not sure what I'm talking about? ....

---------------------------

**The Background**

My buddy /u/medium_mike and I have been running a Fantasy Survivor league of our own creation for the last 30+ seasons. We didn't like the way existing Survivor Fantasy leagues worked so we decided to come up with a point system and management platform that actually rewards good survivor game play. We honestly believe it to be the best format of any other Survivor Fantasy League out there. This site has been built purely out of our own passion for the game as a gift for like-minded fans.

Reddit, we present to you:   
http://tribal-council.com

Registration is free and easy and is actively plugged by us only on /r/survivor. You can even join up to three leagues, public and private! We don't make any money on this site and do it only for fun. But if you love the site, feel free to buy us a cup of coffee. Otherwise, enjoy!


-----------------------------

**The Game**

For those of you who haven't played in past seasons, or for those who need a refresher on the rules, the basic premise is this:

 - You, the player, draft a roster of 8 survivors from this season's list of contestants to be on your team
 - Each week you will put up to 5 of those players on your active roster (scoring points) and leave the rest on your bench (not scoring)
 - During each episode, based on the rules detailed below, your 5 active survivors will (hopefully) earn you points
 - Benched survivors will neither earn you nor cost you points.
 - The goal of the game is to earn more points than anybody else
 - All boiled down, the longer each of your active picks stays in the game and the more challenges they win, the more points they will earn you

-------------------------------

**Roster Management**

Each team consists of 8 survivors, 5 as starters and 3 on the bench. The survivors on your starting roster will score points while benched survivors will not. Once your 8 survivors are drafted and locked in and the season starts you may not add or remove survivors from your roster. You may, and are encouraged to, update which survivors are active and which are benched as many times a week as need be. Roster positions will be locked (usually around 5pm MST) the day that an episode is airing and will be unlocked once the episode is over and new scores have been entered. You'll also be able to completely re-draft your team every time there is a tribe swap or merge in the show.

------------------------------------
**Redrafting**

A redraft is an event that allows you to swap-out any or all of your remaining surviving players with any other survivors in the game. A redraft is always triggered by some event in survivor, as explained below. If you choose not to redraft your team will remain the same as the previous week.

Trigger Events:   
 - the 1st episode (pick all new survivors based on what you saw or keep as many or all of them the same)  
 - after any tribe switch-up (tribes combined / split-up / rocks drawn / new tribes created / or multiple members swapped per tribe)   
 - the merge

I never set out to write just to publish books—I wrote because I had questions, because I needed to explore the hidden layers of reality. But self-publishing? That part came later, almost as an afterthought.

Like many indie authors, I soon realized that **writing is only half the journey—the real challenge is getting it into the hands of those who need it most**. Yet, despite the hurdles, I wouldn’t have it any other way.

Each of my books reflects a different stage in this journey:

📖 **Beyond the Veil of the Ordinary** – Exploring the unseen forces shaping our perception.  
📖 **Embracing the Wonder of Being** – A reflection on the beauty and complexity of existence.  
📖 **The World According to Humans** – How our consciousness constructs reality itself.

🌍 **Why self-publish?** Because some ideas don’t fit neatly into mainstream categories. My books are for seekers, for those who question, for those who wonder.

But of course, the journey doesn’t end at publication. **Marketing, visibility, and reaching the right audience—these are battles we all face.** That’s why I’ve set up my **Ko-fi page** to connect with readers who resonate with my work.

It was with a very professional woman b/c she likes to follow the rules so that legally all the i's and t's are set just right.

Only, she told me it was okay to meet during her lunch break.  My husband works in a factory and pays his onion dues (Maybe the actual word here is why my first story got banned?).  Lunch breaks are sacred, but hey this lady is a grown up, she can choose to work during it.

I wanted to show her thanks and that I see that she is taking important time away from herself to help me and my family, so I brought her a no bake cookie from a local restaurant.  Okay...is it was a good no bake cookie from the local coffee shop in the town 15 min away.  The no bakes in the coffee shop in our town are not as good at all.  I compare and test them out regularly.  
  
This super professional lady, just trying to get through her day, let down her guard and was just so *unbelievably excited* when she realized she was holding a no bake cookie that was all hers.  For just thirty seconds, she did a double take and I saw all the emotion of disbelief and excitement cross her face.  I know that emotion...I get the same way every time I get a no bake cookie...and I get them monthly!  She was able to then set it aside and pull herself together and get back to business.

1iskm1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1iskm1g/are_there_any_symptoms_that_would_help/,Are there any symptoms that would help distinguish MCAS from reflux?,"I've been trying to narrow down what may be the cause of my long list of symptoms. ENT thinks I have LPR, and treating it like LPR seems to somewhat help. However, I have many other symptoms that don't seem to align with LPR (silent reflux). What are some hallmark symptoms that would indicate MCAS over against reflux?

I'm not asking for advice on treatment - but just the facts on what would help distinguish one from the other. 

Here are my symptoms, all of which began 9 days after my Pfizer Covid vaccine (I'm not trying to start a discussion on the vaccine, I'm not a politically minded person - just stating the facts of what happened):

* Heart palpitations, especially in the afternoon, and after eating. Or if I get anxious, I get a lot of palpitations. I never had palpitations almost ever in my life previously. My heart feels like it's pounding loud, yet all cardiology checks have turned out ok. My heart rate swings higher than it used to. (I was a very healthy person, used to rock climb, etc. - so this sensation of heart racing is noticeable and not normal for me).
* 1st week of symptoms it hurt to be in the sun, like my skin I swear was reacting - but that only lasted a week and I feel normal. My skin is totally normal.
* Tingling nerve ""zaps"" or leg sensations for about 4 months.
* LPR-like symptoms, ie shortness of breath. Vocal cord dysfunction, either due to reflux or something else I don't know - but makes it hard to breathe.
* I can't tolerate acidic foods - makes my throat and mouth burn, lose my voice. 
* I can't tolerate toothpastes at all, they make my vocal cords hurt and in turn want to close making it hard to breathe and hard to fall asleep. I only use baking soda now.
* Spots on the tip of my tongue. If it were reflux, I would expect a more random coverage of spots on my tongue from pepsin digesting the tongue, but it is only on the tip. Generally a spot will appear overnight, then it will gradually expand and eventually disappear over 7 days.
* My symptoms are worse in the morning and get better throughout the day.
* Exercise like hiking or biking makes me feel better and improves my heart palpitations.
* I could swear that sugar makes symptoms worse.
* Taking magnesium has helped my heart issues quite a bit.
* Low vitamin d, so supplementing has helped. 
* I get really sore lower leg muscles, almost to the point that it would hurt to stand on them for more than a couple hours. I was never this way before - I could walk all day.
* I could swear that stress or happiness plays a big roll in all of the symptoms. Which is strange because 4 months before the heart palpitations and shortness of breath and all, my son almost died, yet I never experienced any of these symptoms despite being the most traumatic few months of my life. So I don't agree with the conclusion that all of this is just due to anxiety since none of it happened when I had the most anxiety ever. Then later that year, I get a shot and quit drinking coffee and within 10 days \*boom\*, health disaster.
* Early waking insomnia most days.
* If I get a good night's sleep I feel quite good and happy.
* No skin marks or flushing.

  
I'm also investigating and going to be tested for H-Pylori, which can reduce stomach acid, cause reflux, hurt mineral and vitamin absorption, and even cause heart palpitations. All these symptoms started 10 days after Pfizer vaccine and 1 day after quitting drinking coffee, which makes me wonder if it's not the vaccine and that the coffee was somehow protecting me from reflux or something.",1,1739905404.0,MCAS,1,1.0,False

Welcome to the brave new world where AI isn’t just a tool—it’s an existential threat to startups, and maybe to existentialism itself. Just when you thought your overly caffeinated startup life couldn’t be more unpredictable. Turns out, AI isn’t only good at breaking records on Wall Street, but also at breaking hearts in Silicon Valley.

**Why Startups Are Running Scared**

In the past decade, artificial intelligence has transitioned from a science fiction novelty to an all-consuming powerhouse. It’s automating customer service, optimizing supply chains, and yes, even writing blog posts. AI doesn't need sleep, food, coffee breaks, or quirky pep talks to stay motivated. And its ROI? Through the roof. For startups battling for every scrap of market share, this tech is a double-edged sword. While it offers efficiency, it demands something in return: jobs.

- **Hitchhiker’s Guide to Displacement**: Startups, those audacious Davids up against the Goliaths, rely on innovation to leapfrog competitors. But behold! AI is now the slingshot, but with a mind of its own. As companies lean heavily on automation, many employees find themselves transitioning from problem-solvers to AI system monitors.

- **Here Comes the Algorithm**: AI doesn’t stop at making operations efficient; it's redefining business models. And not just in tech-savvy arenas. Think agriculture, healthcare, finance, and even creative fields like writing and art. The line between human input and machine dominance is blurring daily. The integrity of work itself is at stake.

**Is AI the Dark Prince or Startup Saviour?**

Skeptically romantic as we may be with our technology—as if waiting for the robots to have a mid-life crisis and switch to poetry—AI's potential is undeniable. Many startups leverage it to drive productivity, innovate product lines, and even save companies from the brink of collapse. 

- **Innovation or Implosion?**: While the fear of AI replacing jobs is palpable, its promise to carve new paths and roles is equally compelling. AI creates paradigms where humans can focus on creative pursuits and complex decision-making. The key lies in finding a harmony, a partnership even, with our AI counterparts.
  
**Your Turn: Can AI Be Both Friend and Foe?**

It was a book.

Thick. Dust-covered. Bound in something that looked like leather but felt slightly… wrong.

Embossed on the cover in faded gold letters were the words:

GAS ’N GO EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK

Barry’s smile stretched just a little too wide.

He had never seen it before.

And yet, he knew it had always been there.


---

Tina, already halfway through her coffee, froze when she saw it.

""What the hell is that?""

Barry blew dust off the cover. “Employee resources.”

Tina narrowed her eyes. “We don’t have employee resources.”

Barry flipped the book open. “We do now.”

The pages were yellowed, brittle at the edges, and filled with dense, cramped handwriting.

The first section was normal enough.

> ""Welcome to the Gas ’n Go family!""
""Your shift responsibilities include customer service, stocking shelves, and basic store maintenance!""
""Paychecks are processed biweekly.""
""Employees are entitled to one (1) 10-minute break per shift. This break may not be used between the hours of 2:16 AM and 2:18 AM.""



Tina frowned. “…Wait.”

She leaned closer.

Her stomach dropped as Barry turned the page.


---

SECTION 4: CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS

> ""If a man in a blue suit asks for the 'special coffee,' tell him it will be ready in fifteen minutes, then leave the store immediately.""
""If a customer asks for directions and you do not recognize their clothing, send them east. Always east.""
""If a child enters the store alone and does not speak, DO NOT OFFER THEM ANYTHING. DO NOT LET THEM TAKE ANYTHING. If they leave with an item, do not try to retrieve it. Avoid looking at them for too long.""
""If you hear knocking from the supply closet, ignore it. We do not have a supply closet.""




---

SECTION 6: SECURITY FOOTAGE

> ""Do not look at the security feed between 2:16 AM and 2:18 AM.""
""If you see yourself on the monitor, turn off the screen immediately. Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to interact with yourself.""
""If the cameras go static, do not move until they return to normal. You may feel something near you. Stay still.""
""If a customer does not appear on the cameras, do not acknowledge them. If they ask why, tell them the cameras are broken.""




---

SECTION 8: INVENTORY MANAGEMENT

> ""If an item disappears mid-purchase, do not acknowledge it. It is no longer ours.""
""If you find an item with a label written in a language you cannot read, place it on the bottom shelf in Aisle 3. Do not look at it again.""
""If a customer tries to purchase something you do not recognize, let them. Do not scan it.""
""Sometimes the hot dogs do not cook. Sometimes they are not hot dogs. Do not sell the ones that are not hot dogs.""




---

Barry’s fingers tapped a steady rhythm against the counter as he turned the page.

Tina shut the book immediately.

Her hands were shaking slightly.

She inhaled through her nose. Exhaled through her mouth. Then, carefully, she asked:

""Frank. Did you know about this?""

Frank, sitting in the break room, sipping his coffee, barely glanced up.

""…Nope.""

Tina squinted at him. ""You said that too fast.""

Frank took another sip of coffee. ""No, I didn’t.""

Tina wanted to throw the book at his head.

Barry, unbothered, slid a finger down the page, eyes gleaming in the dim fluorescent light.

""Ah. Here’s a good one.""

> ""If a man who looks like Frank comes in during Frank’s shift, do not let him speak to Frank. If they see each other, tell the second Frank to leave. If he refuses, shut off the lights. When you turn them back on, there should only be one Frank.""



Tina felt actual nausea creep up her throat.

""I hate that it specifies ‘should.’""

She turned toward Frank, half-expecting him to react.

Frank did not.

Barry flipped another page.

> ""If someone arrives to ‘pick up the delivery,’ ask them what color the sky is. If they say anything other than blue, tell them you are out of stock.""
 ""If something knocks on the back door and you are not expecting a delivery, do not open it. Do not check the cameras. Do not acknowledge it.""
""If you hear a voice on the intercom that does not belong to you or a coworker, do not respond. Continue working as normal.""
""If a man enters the store, shops, pays, and leaves, but something feels wrong, check the register. If there is no record of his purchase, DO NOT SPEAK TO HIM IF HE COMES BACK.""
""If an employee’s shadow moves before they do, do not comment on it. Do not look directly at them until it passes.""



Tina’s breath hitched.

Her eyes flickered toward Barry.

He was smiling.

His shadow stretched across the counter, longer than it should have been.

For just a second.

Then it was normal again.

At 3:30 AM, Chad entered.

He took one look at Barry, Tina, and the general atmosphere of existential dread and immediately froze.

His paranoia sensors activated.

""Alright. No. What’s happening. What did you guys find?""

Tina, without hesitation, threw the book at him.

Chad fumbled the catch, looked at the cover, and instantly recoiled.

""OH, ABSOLUTELY NOT.""

He held the book at arm’s length, like it might bite him.

""WHAT IS THIS. WHY DOES IT FEEL LIKE THIS.""

Tina, deadpan: ""It’s the employee handbook.""

Chad stared at her. Then at the book. Then back at her.

""WHY DO YOU HAVE AN EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK? YOU DON’T HAVE RULES.""

Tina pointed at the book. ""We do. They’re just worse than we thought.""

Chad flipped open a random page. Read a few lines. Slammed it shut.

His face paled. “No. No, no, no. This is bad.”

Tina gestured at him. ""See? Even Chad thinks it’s bad!""

Barry watched Chad with quiet amusement. ""Why?""

Chad threw up his hands. ""BECAUSE IT’S CURSED, MAN.""

Barry’s eyes gleamed. ""Oh? But how do you know that?""

Chad froze.

His paranoia turned inward.

Tina squinted. ""…Yeah, how do you know that?""

Chad pointed aggressively at the book. ""I don’t have to know! I can feel it! My conspiracy senses are going nuts!""

Barry calmly closed the book and placed it back under the counter.

The store felt normal again.

Chad exhaled sharply. ""Oh, I hate that.""


---

Tina, drained, turned back to Frank.

""You really didn’t know about this?""

Frank, without looking up from his coffee: ""Nope.""

Tina narrowed her eyes. ""If there was a second Frank, would you want us to turn off the lights?""

Frank took a long sip of coffee.

""Yes.""

Tina flopped her head down onto the counter.

1iskesp,https://www.reddit.com/r/WellbeingHypnotherapy/comments/1iskesp/introverts_and_anxiety_practical_strategies_for/,Introverts and Anxiety: Practical Strategies for Sustainable Wellbeing,"Introverts. Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments. We may enjoy socialising but we recharge by spending time on our own, we often enjoying getting lost in our own thoughts – just enjoying being inside our own heads for a while. We tend to lean toward smaller, close-knit social lives. But let’s clear up a misconception: introversion doesn’t mean we’re anti-social. It just means we are at our best in situations that aren’t overwhelming.

Anxiety. The emotion that warns us when something threatening seems to be just around the corner. In moments of true danger, it can be life-saving: the foresight that there is trouble ahead, and those vital few seconds to get ready for it saved many of our ancient ancestors (while their peers perished – unable to pass on their genes.) That’s one of the factors why we’re here today. But, when anxiety lingers beyond its intended purpose, it becomes not just tiring—it’s exhausting. If this sounds familiar, you’re definitely not alone.

Not all introverts experience anxiety, and you don’t have to be an introvert to struggle with it. But many introverts do. It’s a common combination, and knowing how to navigate it can make all the difference.

 

**Signs You’re an Introvert with Anxiety—which ones do you relate to the most?**

1. You Typically Overprepare

You think through worst-case scenarios in detail. It makes you feel more in control—but it can also be draining.

Tip: When you find yourself imagining worst-case outcomes, think about a balanced ""most likely scenario"" scenario too. Give yourself permission to think about the ‘’best case scenario’’ – luck isn’t a good strategy, but take it when you get it! Thinking through these scenarios helps to bring your anxious thoughts back to a more realistic middle ground. This practice doesn’t stop your mind from thinking about risks but it does help add perspective.

 

2. You Tend to Overthink and Listen to Your Inner Critic

Introverts often have rich inner lives, which can mean their internal dialogue is active—sometimes too active. Anxiety amplifies this, often turning up the volume on self-critical thoughts.

Tip: Develop a ritual for challenging anxious thoughts. When a negative thought comes up, ask yourself: ""Is this thought 100% true?"" Most often, it won’t be. Questioning and even writing down these thoughts can give you some distance from them, reducing their power. If this is an issue for, look up my article ‘From Limitations to Liberation’ – it takes a dive in to tackling limiting beliefs.

 

3. You Always Feel the Need to Be Busy

Anxiety often compels you to keep moving (it’s a high energy ‘state’ – one of the reasons it can be so tiring)—constantly doing something. But staying busy can sometimes just mean staying distracted, without actually being effective.

Tip: Replace ""busy"" with ""purposeful."" Each day, set just one or two specific goals that really matter to you. A small amount of focused effort is often more satisfying (and less stressful) than a day spent rushing from one task to the next with no real direction. Ask yourself at least five times a day: ‘what is the most value adding thing (in the context of what your life is about) I could be doing right now?’

 

4. You Prefer Routines and Struggle When Things Go Off-Plan

Routines give a sense of control, but sometimes they turn into rigid safety nets – sometimes beyond them being value adding. When something unexpected happens, it can trigger deep unease.

Tip: Practice gentle flexibility. Start small: maybe change the route you walk or try a new café. These small ""novelty exercises"" help build resilience for when larger, unexpected changes occur. The key is to show yourself that change, is often manageable. Remember that change is neither good or bad (change can also be for the better). Remember also that we have been ‘programmed’ by our evolution to perceive change as bad: once we transcend that ‘programming’ new avenues of opportunity open up for us. 

 

5. You Hide Nervousness Behind a Mask

You’ve learned to mask nervousness well, but that doesn’t mean it’s not taking a toll internally.

Tip: Identify trusted people who you can be honest with. Even if it’s just one close friend or a journal entry, letting out what you're feeling helps you process the anxiety instead of holding it all in. Vulnerability is powerful; it connects you to others and often takes the edge off anxiety.

 

6. You See More Danger Than Others in Everyday Situations

Anxiety primes your mind to be vigilant (and reduces your options – see my article ‘Live the life you choose – expand your Thought-Action Repertoire’), sometimes turning neutral situations into seemingly threatening ones.

Tip: Try reframing the ""threat."" If you’re anxious before a social event, instead of focusing on what could go wrong, set a small, achievable goal for the event—like having a meaningful conversation with one person. Reframing your focus can help your mind move away from perceived threats and toward positive intentions.

 

7. Perfectionism and People-Pleasing

Perfectionism often stems from a need to feel worthy. Beliefs like “I need everyone to like me to be valuable” create intense anxiety around how you’re perceived.

Tip: Shift from a focus on being liked to being authentic (are you living your life for you or for ‘them’?) Practice saying ""no"" in low-stakes situations. Remember, you’re not responsible for everyone else’s happiness: you are responsible for your well-being (not theirs!) The right people will appreciate your true self more than a perfected (according to who?) version of you.

 

8. Nerves Sometimes Turn You In to an Over-Talker

Normally, you speak only when you feel confident, but anxiety can shift you into overdrive, where you say too much to fill the silence.

Tip: If you catch yourself over-talking, pause and take a deep breath. Silence can feel awkward, but it’s not a problem. Giving yourself permission to pause helps reduce the pressure to fill every moment with words.

 

9. Trouble Sleeping

Anxiety makes it hard for your mind to shut off at night, leading to trouble falling asleep, frequent waking, or early rising.

Tip: Create a ""wind-down"" routine. Dedicate the last 30-60 minutes before bed to relaxing, tech-free activities. Reading something light, or writing down your thoughts can help signal your brain that it’s time to rest. Top tips (1) get as cold as you can (reductions in our core body temperatures are a cue to go to sleep) (2) forget the clock telling you it is ‘lights out’ time – read until your eyes close and your head nods.

 

**Moving From Awareness to Action**

Being an introvert with anxiety can feel overwhelming at times, but it’s also something you can learn to manage with care and practice. Anxiety may not disappear overnight, but you can make shifts that help it lose its hold on your everyday life. You’re not alone. Many of us walk this path, learning how to balance the gifts and challenges of introversion and anxiety. Keep being gentle with yourself—there’s strength in softness.

 

**Practical Strategies for Thriving as an Introvert**

 

1.      Create and Protect Your Recharge Time

For us introverts, alone time is essential for recharging. Make it non-negotiable. Whether it’s 30 minutes in the morning or a quiet evening ritual, schedule time just for yourself. Communicate this need with those around you—it’s a matter of maintaining your well-being, not just a preference.

 

2.      Leverage Your Strengths in One-on-One or Small Group Interactions

We tend to excel in deeper, more intimate conversations. Rather than pushing yourself to thrive in large social gatherings, seek out or create opportunities for one-on-one or small group interactions. You could host a dinner with close friends, or meet up individually for coffee. Cultivate the type of social life that aligns with your strengths.

 

3.      Prepare and Plan for Social Situations

One of the best tools for introverts is preparation. If you have a social event or a work meeting coming up, prepare conversation topics, questions, or think about what you hope to get from the interaction. This doesn’t mean scripting everything, but it does mean having some mental prompts to feel more comfortable and confident. You don’t even have to say much: a few thoughtful questions can go a long way.

 

4.      Create a Space at Home that Grounds You

Set up a specific space in your home where you feel completely relaxed—this could be a reading nook, a meditation corner, or even just a comfy chair by a window. Use this space to do whatever helps you feel grounded, such as journaling, reading, or simply sitting in silence. Having a dedicated spot to return to helps to re-centre yourself, especially after having been with people.

 

5.      Harness Your Listening Superpower

Introverts are often strong listeners, and this can be a powerful skill in both social and work settings.

Why does the water in my La Pavoni smell bad?

I accidentally left it on for at least 3 hours, and now the water has a strange odor. I've tried dish soap, vinegar, baking soda, and group head cleaner, but nothing seems to help.

Has anyone experienced this before? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

1iskdeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/comments/1iskdeh/boredom_breeds_complacency/,Boredom breeds complacency.,"*This is a long one, so be warned. It is also a great example of how I was at times competent as a soldier. I hope y'all enjoy.*

A lot of being in the Army is being bored. There is so much that is mundane that it can't be helped. So you try to put the time to good use where you can. For example, during Desert Shield, I ran a PMCS on our Vulcan so often that it never broke down. Because I had the time to do so and was bored. But I wrote about that before. And while I was bored in Saudi Arabia for the most part, this is about a time in America.

During my third or fourth FTX with A 5/62 at Fort Bliss as a new soldier, we were again in White Sands, NM, ""playing Army."" Being a newly stood up unit after being reorganized, we were engaged in practicing and refining our training. That kind of constant rehearsal is why the American Army is so damn good. In any case, our focus for this FTX was concealment and security.

At the time, I wasn't on a Vulcan yet. I was in a two man team on a HMMWV as were most Stinger gunners in the Army. Our Platoon Sergeant gave each team a grid sqare before we drove out of the side gate and left Texas that we were expected to be at. We also had to set up a secondary position, and pick out a tertiary position. The primary absolutely had to be in that grid square or you failed. The other two had to be in or very close to the square, so they could be over the border into the next one a bit.

White Sands can be hard to navigate. From my experience, it is nothing but sand dunes and yucca plants. Half the roads that are on the official Army maps weren't there anymore due to erosion, and half the roads in the desert weren't on the map. And all of the roads were made of sand with no kind of markings or signage. So you had to navigate. I HATE being lost. So I made sure to ace land navigation during Basic and AIT. I never got lost in the Army. I still can't get lost today in the wild if I have a map and a compass. Anyway, land navigation was a boring class, but I paid attention and became very competent.

The only way to reliably navigate pre-GPS with the tools we had was a bit complicated. The maps were in kilometers, while our vehicle odometers were in miles. Sigh. So to get to point A, you draw a straight line between the two and measure the distance in kilometers and take a bearing with your compass so you know what direction to go in. Then you convert that to miles. Navigating in Korea was a lot easier - we had actual terrain and elevation changes that we could use as markers.

Doing the math was the fun part. A lot of the guys in my unit weren't real bright. Of course, you could argue that I wasn't that bright since I had such a high ASVAB score and picked ADA, but here we are. Anyway, most of these cats couldn't do basic math. Some hadn't finished high school and were in on waivers. So before we left the rally point for the battery inside of White Sands, the Platoon Sergeant hollered at me.

*""COBB! Get your ass over here and show these guys how to do this.""*

The class was showing them how to convert from miles to kilometers and back again. I guess even back then I had the makings of a teacher in me. Heh. I rolled the map out on the hood of the HMMWV, pulled out a compass and a grease pencil, then showed them how I was getting from the rally point to my assigned position. When I looked around to see how my lesson went, they were looking at me like I had just brought Jesus back to life. Witchcraft or something. It was so easy it wasn't computing with some of them. So I ran through it again, and we made sure that least all the team chiefs got it, but by the second time most of the drivers did too. Really, probably only about half of the guys needed the refresher course though, I was far from the only competent one. The Vulcan platoons were having their meetings and similar refresher courses around us.

The yucca plants were protected or something, and we weren't supposed to mess with them. But I liked driving over dunes with the plants on them instead of around them. It was easier to keep the compass on a heading and it didn't throw off your distance measurement the way swerving around dunes did - that's how a lot of guys got lost. Well, that and I laughed when we drove over the plants and the pods blew up. Like I said, boredom. But we got to our position and got it set it up. For the primary, we were expected to dig a small ASP (Ammo Storage Point), a reinforced two man fighting position with cover, and to camouflage our vehicle as best as we could with our camo nets. We carried empty sandbags and some scrap 2x4s and plywood in the back of the HMMWVs under the missile rack to do this with, it was part of our loadout in Texas and Korea.

The secondary position needed to have a smaller two man fighting position that was well camouflaged, but didn't have to be reinforced with a cover and no ASP. The tertiary position was just a dot on a map and didn't require any prep. The secondary and tertiary were for after we fired our first loadout or if one position was compromised in some way. 

One of the fun games the NCOs would play is they would try to find you within your grid square without letting you know first. If they did, they would say your position is compromised. So then you had to pack up, go to the secondary and improve it to first position standards. Then go to your tertiary position and improve it to secondary position standards, then pick a tertiary position. Those days SUCKED.

The NCOs were supposed to come by sometime after lunch on this day to check on us. My TC and I worked backwards. After we found our primary position, we looked around and at the map before picking a tertiary about 700 meters away. Then we chose a secondary about 400 meters from that one, forming a rough triangle. We drove over to prep the secondary position, where we dug out a fighting position and camouflaged it as best we could with some dead plants and whatnot, then drove to the primary.

We were done in two hours, but we worked at it another full hour before we were happy. We wanted it to be better than ""pass"" - we wanted it to be good. Being the gunner, the team chief made me walk about 500 meters out to see how good of a job we did. I couldn't see shit. Even at 100 meters I wasn't sure if it was netting or plant leaves I was looking at. We did a good job, especially because a big chunk of the HMMWV was hiding behind the dune we had dug into, breaking up the outline of the truck and the nets over it. The metal poles you carry for the netting were propping the net up on one side to give the impression the dune was longer than it was, further concealing the truck under the net and partially behind the dune.

I trudged back, cursing the heat, and we ate lunch. As I slurped down some Ramen and enjoyed the burn of the tabasco, I looked around. The very small road that wound it's way near our position had another large dune about 50 meters away from us. I felt the beginnings of an idea. By time I finished eating and had some water, I had a plan.

*""Hey D - how tired are you?""* He threw me some side eye. *""Why?""* I laid out my plan.

A couple hours later, the New Mexico/Texas sun had passed the zenith, and the day was reaching peak temperature before it would drop off to something really pleasant before dark. We were exhausted from the extra work, but this was going to be worth it. Eventually, the expected radio call came in.

*""Team 4, this is Blaster 2. Come in, over.""* Our platoon sergeant. Blaster 1 was our LT, but I had no idea what he was doing. Probably polishing the brigade commander's boots or something. *""Blaster 2, Team 4. Over.""*

*""Give me the coordinates of your primary, over.""* And here is where my Team Chief and I show we were paying attention in our OPSEC and COMSEC briefings. See, you are expected to authenticate who you are, by giving me a response to a pre-chosen passphrase. These are stored in a little codebook. Each day you have a different one. So I responded appropriately. *""That's a negative. Authenticate Whiskey Hotel.""*

See, we were taught in Basic and in subsequent trainings that even though our radios were encrypted, we had to assume that either someone was listening, or those sneaky Russians had captured a radio and were using English speakers to fuck with us. So you play the game with the NCOs. You demand they authenticate, and they try to bully you into talking to them without it. They had successfully gotten two teams to fall for it as the rest of the platoon listened in on the radio, and were in trouble as a result. So we went back and forth for almost five minutes, with our Platoon Sergeant breaking all radio protocol and cussing us out in an effort to get us to break. He didn't get us to quit, so he finally gave in.

Once he gave us the proper response, we let him know where we were at, and sat back to wait. After probably 30 minutes, we hear the diesel engine of another HMMWV coming close to our position. I held my rifle tight, a bit nervous. I had to stop him before he got too close to us or we failed the exercise. As he rolled into our AO, he stopped. Before the engine had completely stopped running, he was out of his HMMWV, facing our fighting position, screaming bloody murder.

*""What the fuck is this shit!? I saw this sorry ass position from over 100 meters out. You two assholes aren't stopping shit! Why the hell didn't one of you challenge me before I got here? Why could I see your antenna from way the hell out there? What the fuck....""* That's when he felt my rifle pressed into his back.

See, he wasn't at our position. What I had seen during lunch was that the other dune was large enough to make a fighting position in, but we chose this one because it was farther off the road. So we set up a decoy position in that one after lunch. Why? Because it was tactically sound, we were bored, and this would be funny. We dug down just deep enough to make it look at first glance like it was a position. We got some sticks from the yucca plants and taped them up with duct tape to make them long enough to pass for antennas. Those we stuck straight up, where as the antennas on our vehicle were bent over in an arc and secured beneath the net. We had taken a camo net we didn't need and just half ass threw it over the ""fighting position"" in the sloppiest manner possible. We left tons of boot prints all over the front of that area, but had swept them with yucca leaves by the real one. I had been laying down behind a smaller dune, so when Sarge got out, he had had his back to me.

*""Bang! Sorry, Sarge.""* That's when my TC came out from our real position farther away with his rifle also pointed at Sarge. The look on our Sergeant's face was worth it. The three of us started laughing. It was doubled over, knee slapping, ""holy fuck you got me"" laughter and it went on for minutes. Then we showed him our real position, which he complimented, then we pointed out the other two on the map, and off he went to see them.

We got an ""attaboy"" from him later in formation after the FTX was over, so that was nice.

I was still bored though. Not much to do really. Thankfully I pre-planned. So on day 2, I cleaned the FUCK out of my rifle. I was not going to sit around for two or three hours trying to get all the sand out of it tomorrow after we were done. It was bad enough we had to drive the trucks and tracks to the wash facility and then do a full PMCS on them all when we got back. If I didn't have to fuck with my rifle, I could actually be ahead of schedule. Hell yeah. So I spent the day cleaning while we were supposed to be ""looking for enemy aircraft."" I think I saw a 737 headed to the El Paso airport, but that was it. When I was done, I wrapped it up in a black garbage bag and tied it tight.

A little later, my TC saw me reading a book and my bag wrapped rifle laid across my lap. *""What the hell, Cobb?""* So I explained. *""You do realize your rifle needs to be immediately ready, right?""* He could have made me take it out of the bag, but he didn't.

Things went as predicted. In the morning, we woke up. Being on a two man team, you are constantly exhausted as you still have to keep watch. We just broke it up into two shifts. It was always informal on every team I was on. You are all up at night until someone decides to go to bed. At that point, night watch begins. You have to be up at whatever time, so you take the hours left between then and now and divide it up between your 2-4 man team, depending on your battery and platoon configuration.

Around 0500 though, we were both up and heating water in our canteen cups on the engine for coffee while we choked down MREs and laughed about surprising Sarge the day before. Then we broke down our position and cleaned up, filling in our fighting position, dumping sandbags, recovering plywood. After that, we drove to our secondary and restored it as best we could. Believe it or not, the Army was very environmentally aware back then, at least at Fort Bliss. Not me though. I murdered more Yucca that day. Then we drove to the rally point near the Texas border, and from there convoyed in. We ran the battery's vehicles through the wash facility and then drove back to the motor pool and do the PMCS. Then we go to turn in rifles. Here is where we would all go sit it in the PT area outside the back of our barracks and clean our rifles while we smoked and joked, and talked about the drinking and fucking we would do after evening formation and chow.

Not me.

I SPRINTED to the armory downstairs from the barracks while the rest were sitting down to start. First in line, because there was no line. It was still around 1500, there wouldn't be a line for at least 30 minutes. As I ran, I tore off the garbage bag, stuffing the remains in my pockets so I wouldn't be yelled at for littering. I heard someone ask what the fuck my problem was. I flew down the stairs in a rush, then burst into the armory, thrusting my rifle at the man in charge.

CPL Perez gave my M-16 the hard eye. Then again. Then a third time. He looked up at me, almost in disbelief. He was used to turning away the the first several rifles. Guys were always in a hurry after an FTX to get out of there, so they did a half ass job and hoped they would slip by. Perez turned and looked at the clock, then back at me. Again, just like the guys and the map reading, almost accusing me of witchcraft, because there was no way I was done this early. Grudgingly, he pronounced my rifle clean, we signed the control book, and I walked over to the DFAC for an early dinner before evening formation and dismissal. After, I went and showered and shaved. I threw on my old uniform long enough to make formation, but I was in my civvies ten minutes after that, and at the bowling alley 20 minutes later. Frank, Johnny and Eddie showed up about 90 minutes later.

I got hammered as hell that night. Hitting the bars even a little early makes a huge difference. And the hangover was brutal.

But, I also really shined with my leadership. I taught a bunch of guys how to navigate a changing desert without getting lost. We set up a great position and showed our capability for deception as we would in war. I kept my equipment in good working order. I got my work done early.

FTXs really do suck pretty hard, but boredom breeds competency.

But we never question his authenticity as a mobster until he sells out to Jamba Juice. By forcing the neighborhood poultry & egg market (note: the eggs) to close, Tony confirms that he isn’t a real mafioso. A traditional made man, especially a Don, would never shut down a local, Italian-owned small business in favor of a Jamba Juice. 

This brings me to the conclusion that Patsy was the one who clipped Tony. In an earlier episode, Patsy tries to extort a Starbucks-type coffee shop only to discover it’s not possible to run a protection racket there: “It’s over for the little guys.” 

Tony’s final betrayal is his egregious act of dismantling “this thing of ours” for his own greed. 

Patsy took action there.

1isk43u,https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1isk43u/my_accidental_wild_and_how_i_done_it/,"My accidental WILD, and how I done it.","Hey everybody, Im here to tell you how I accidentally done a WILD. Maybe someone will find it useful!

I dont want to make a very long post, so I'll try to describe everything shortly.

  
What is WILD? WILD or Wake Initiated Lucid Dream, is a form of Lucid Dream, where you maintain awareness while falling asleep, and entering your dream directly. There are some common myths around WILD, and Im going to talk about them firstly. If you want to skip to the main part, feel free!



**The WILD myths.**

You have to lie still - No, you dont. You dont need to lie still. Your body will change its position anyways during the night.

Dont swallow saliva - You can swallow saliva, and I recommend you to do it actually. Why? You have to be comfortable during WILD, and you cant be when youre overthinking to swallow it or not. Just do it and forget about this thing.

You cant scratch yourself - Dont worry, you can scratch those itches. Your mission is to be comfortable during WILD, and you literally cant be while you have urge to scratch yourself.

You dont need to induce SP to perfmorm WILD. I dont even know why ppls think they have to induce it.

These above, are the most common myths. Now, with that, lets jump to my main part!

  
**The Main Part.**

I saw ppls strugling with WILD on this reddit, I saw some laying on the floor for 15 minutes techniques (wtf), and then going back to bed. I saw ppls talking about coffee during WBTB for WILD *(dont do that, unless, your main idea is to fck up your sleep cycles!).* I tried WILD in the past, but with really minor success, but today's morning was different - I actually manage to do WILD. How I done it?

It was around 9AM, I grabbed my phone and wrote down my dreams in the Dream Journal app. After that, I scrolled through some shit on the internet (I spent around 30 minutes in total on my phone), and I decided to take some more sleep - tho, I didnt wanted to, because I wasnt sleepy.

I lied in comfortable position, ready to fall asleep, but I was bored as hella, and I decided to train MILD while I was laying. I imagined some fake scenarios in my head, and me in them realizing that Im dreaming. I continue that MILD exercise for like 5-8 minutes. I continued this one scenario, imagining new things in it, sounds etc... THEN, I felt a very annoying itch on my face... but I was too lazy to scratch it, like really, I was like ""Fuck that dude, Im too lazy. Just let me sleep"". This itch was growing stronger, stronger.. and stronger... I ignoreed it because I was too lazy to scratch it. Suddenly - it disappeared, my phone music as well (I left my phone with silent music, I often do this). All external sounds disappeared as well, everything just went blank. I got scared and just changed my body position to lie on my stomach - and here we go baby...! I lied on my stomach and I saw strong light behind my eyelids. My body felt like floating, it was weightless. I saw random Anime girl pulling her hand towards me, and her hand was getting more and more realistic, so I was imagining more of her and imagined her, pulling me inside the dream. Guess what? As soon as I imagined her pulling me to the dream, she got entire shape and just pulled me to the dream by my hand. Her body felt soooo real on mine when she took my hand and just cuddled to me. We were on a beach and just chilled when suddenly I heard a vacuum cleaner and my phone music! I knew Im going to wake up and as I thought - I woke up, but as soon as I woke up, I lied still and tried DEILD technique. It worked on first time and I re-entered the dream. I was still hearing this vacuum cleaner and my music from phone tho. I tried to move my hand in the dream slowly, to see if its going to move irl as well (spoiler, it didnt moved irl). I walked around this beach for like 20 seconds and then woke up because I had to go.

  
This is how I done WILD accidentally, and I believe you can also as well, its not that hard as it seems. I thought WILD is some hard shit but nah. The best way to do WILD..? Dont overthink it. I have ADHD brain and slight aphantasia - yes, it is hard for me to imagine something. Sooo... if someone like me, with ADHD and aphantasia, managed to do WILD.. why you couldnt?

If you have questions - ask me here or in DMs! I can also give you some good advices when it comes to the Lucid Dreaming. Im into Lucid Dreaming for slightly over 3 years now :) (If you want to ask something more about WILD, I might not satisfy you with my response, because Im not that much into WILDs as in DILDs)

1isk3ei,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1isk3ei/priorat_tasting_report/,Priorat tasting report,"Finally got to Priorat! There are so many wineries here, I know we missed some great ones, and even only saw a few of the villages. We chose based on availability (many not open this time of year), villages we wanted to visit, inclusion of some wineries we knew and others we did not but had read about. After many years of wine tasting, we won’t do more than 2 in a day, making sure to have a sizeable walking and coffee break in between. We mostly based out of Tarragona, which was beautiful and easy to get in and out of (\~1hr max to the farthest north winery we visited and allowed us to be by the sea). The folks in Catalunya are amongst the nicest we have ever interreacted with on trips to Europe, no matter the cheapest streetside restaurant, to in busy parts of Barcelona. Anyways, winter was a great time to be here, the wineries, villages, and even larger cities were very easy to get around. Here is where we ended up and some notes. I am a mere enthusiast, not professional taster.

D1 - left US, travel day.

D2 – arrival. Don’t do tasting anymore on arrival days – too tired and don’t end up remembering them.

D3:

Clos de l’Obac in Grattalops – Tour was with the owner, Carles Pastrana, one of the pioneers in the Priorat revitalization. He was so passionate about the region and the wine quality. He even did the tasting (perks of the job!) with us and opened several wines not on the list. Wines were medium bodied, rather high acidity, elegant, structured, both floral and earthy on the nose and palate. Limited intervention and all estate. Favorite was 2008 Kyrie red blend. They never change their blend percentages, so variation is year to year harvest. Priciest tasting and individual wines that we experienced, but so glad we did. I recommend taking some time to walk around Grattalops, charming village with some great views. On our way to the next one, we also drove through La Viella Baxa and La Viella Alta.  A lot of wineries there too, though we just enjoyed the sights. Beautiful villages.

Cellers Scala Dei in Escaladei – Mix of modern and historic approaches and facilities. Very open about which contributions were estate and which were purchased, all the techniques they have tried, which worked well, and which failed. Found all blends to be very Grenache forward, a lot from clay heavy soils. The more we went from general blends to region/plot specific wine, the more clay dominant the soils from which the grapes were harvested became – the wine became progressively more fruit forward, but I would not say over extracted. I enjoyed them a lot, but preferred their simpler, lower cost blends. Really liked the Blanc de Scala Dei. Very floral on the nose. A lot of minerality, acidity, and tropical fruit on the plate. These wines would be great with barbecue in my opinion. Escaladei is a very sleepy village. We were told most of the activity is the 2 wineries in town, and a few restaurants. Apparently, only like 15 people live there. We still enjoyed walking around, even though everything else except the winery was closed. 

D4:

Celler Pasanau in La Morera. They claim to be the highest elevation winery in the region, which seems to be true based up the map they showed us, the high cliffs and soaring Griffon vultures (some thought they were eagles, though I had binoculars). We took a walk to one of the vineyards, which had some cab sav vines from the 80s and some newer grenache. Surprising how readily attainable the wine is in the USA given how small the production facility seemed. The range of wines was quite variable in terms of composition that included mostly cab sav, mostly grenache, all grenache, to mostly Carignan. I found the grenache to be a bit brighter, more ripe than stewed strawberries, with a fresher and some herbal component (wild rosemary and other herbs all around). The Carignan contributed grippy tannins, bright cranberry, just ripe sour cherries. The cab sav also had more red fruit, acidity, and a more medium body than I am used to. We ended up liking them all, settling on buying a bottle of the 100% grenache. This was a really enjoyable visit. While the village was very sleepy, there are also some hiking trails just above the winery, with amazing views. 

D5: 

No tastings – business day in the area to help pay for the trip.

D6:

No tastings – enjoyed Tarragona and Capellans

D7:

Celler Cal Pla in Porerra. Shown two cellars close by main part of Porerra. 10 generations of wine making. 150-year-old barrels still in use. Higher production of whites than we heard from most, up to 15% of total production. Really loved the Garnatxa Blanca, Picapoll Blanc, and Xarello blend. Lots of minerality, acidity, medium body, with white fruits. The older vintages had a hint of petrol that you might find on aged Resiling. The reds were very well balanced, with soft tannins and minerality. The Porrera Black Slate was amongst our tastings – black slate project features 5 Priorat villages (winemakers not always clear). The Porrera one was the 1^(st) Priorat I had some years ago and remains my favorite black slate project wine. They showed us the barrels it came from, which was neat. We tasted many different percentages and vintages of their blends. In the end, the white blend and the Mas d'En Compte (mostly Grenache, Carignan, I believe) best captured the notes I mentioned above.

Sangenís i Vaqué in Porerra. Right around the corner from Cal Pla (the families have some connections). Most unique tour/tasting. After tour, headed up into the vineyard on an old jeep for tasting with an amazing view of Porrera and surrounding hills. Views were beautiful. Found the wines rather unique too. Grenache contributions were less ripe red fruit than I was used to, and Carignan contributed grippy, but palatable tannins – they had some 100% versions, where I was able to discern that the complexity of this grape was beyond the typical cranberry notes I typically get. We tried wines (10 total, thankfully small pours) back to 2000, that seemed like they could keep going. While it won’t name them, older wines from other houses we tried, seemed a bit past their prime. The pride in this family run winery really showed through. I would certainly put this one up against some of the very pricey Grattalops houses. Very enjoyable.

D8:

Sabate I Coca/Catellroig, ok not Priorat, but Penedes. Could not leave the area without some sparkling. Really enjoyed the history of this house, the family museums within, and the story of how they left the Cava designation to help form the Corpinnat collective. Excellent tour of the whole facility. We were there for the sparkling of course. It was hard to put the still wines up against anything we had from Spain (yes, we sampled other wines beyond Priorat, during dinners, including some Ribera Del Dueros). The sparkling offerings, especially the blanc, brut natures were our favorite, especially the Josep Coca, which had a great balance of notes from tropical fruits, some macerated fruits, a hint of cocoa/earth and a long finish. 

Overall impression – not a bad one of the bunch, absolutely loved this trip and need to expand my cellar’s priorate composition. I know they are not all this amazing (there were a few we chose not to go to based upon taste preference). We did spend a little time in Barcelona – folks there were shocked we spent so little time in the city. It is beautiful and we need to go back, but I am glad we spent so much of this trip in the small Priorat villages. ",6,1739904206.0,wine,2,0.88,False

I hadn’t planned on staying in Kochi for the night, but a last-minute work commitment had me checking into a boutique hotel near Marine Drive. The city’s evening lights shimmered over the backwaters, and after a long, exhausting day, I decided to unwind at a rooftop bar overlooking the water.

That’s where I saw her.

She sat alone at the bar, absentmindedly tracing the rim of her glass. Long, dark hair cascaded over her shoulder, and there was something effortlessly intriguing about the way she carried herself—self-assured yet distant. I ordered my drink, stealing a glance in her direction. Our eyes met. She held my gaze a second longer than necessary before smirking and looking away.

I took that as an invitation.

“Are you waiting for someone?” I asked, settling onto the stool beside her.

She turned to me, her expression teasing. “Not anymore.”

Her name was Ananya. She was in town for a short break, escaping the monotony of routine. We talked about travel, late-night drives, and the best hidden food joints in Kerala. The conversation flowed effortlessly, the kind that makes time slip away unnoticed. Our glasses emptied and refilled, laughter came easier, and with each passing moment, the air between us grew warmer, charged with unspoken understanding.

At some point, she leaned in slightly, her voice quieter now. “Want to get out of here?”

There was something playful in her eyes as she pulled out her key card and placed it between us. “I have a better view from my room.”

I hesitated for only a second before picking it up.

Her hotel was a short walk away, and by the time we stepped into her room, the city outside felt miles away. The night unfolded in whispers and warmth, a fleeting connection without expectations, without promises.

By morning, golden sunlight streamed through the curtains, casting a soft glow over the room. She was already awake, sitting by the window with a cup of coffee in hand, her expression unreadable.

She caught me watching her and smiled—a small, knowing smile.

“No promises, right?” she murmured as she walked over to where I sat on the edge of the bed.

“Right,” I agreed, my voice still heavy with sleep.

She leaned down, pressing a soft, lingering kiss on my lips—one last moment before the night truly ended. Then, without another word, she picked up her bag and walked to the door.

I watched as she disappeared down the hallway, leaving behind nothing but the faint scent of her perfume and the memory of a night that didn’t need a future to feel unforgettable.",1,1739904130.0,u_TraditionHappy1169,0,1.0,False

Hi, I'm a 20yr old female who was recently diagnosed(? I think?) with ""silent reflux"". I haven't had solid foods in a little over two weeks. 

My life has been absolute hell recently so here's some story: 
Starting the week before the superbowl I started having some breathing concerns. I went to urgent care, lungs sounded clear. I called an ambulance a few times, lungs sounded clear. On the Saturday of that week I had some audible wheezing/a high pitched noise when I inhaled. I went to the ER and my lungs sounded ""coarse"". They gave me albuterol and sent me on my way. Symptoms worsened, I went back. They prescribed me steroids and another breathing treatment. Monday was suffering. Went back on Tuesday, and Wednesday. Same thing happened. Breathing treatment, dismissed. Throughout this whole time I had multiple chest xrays, one throat xray. Went to a different hospital for a second opinion, they got me a cat scan to make sure it wasn't pneumonia. Cat scan was fine. Everytime I stood I felt like I was gonna pass out, I ran out of (and still am running out of) breath just by walking to the bathroom or upstairs, my heart palpitations were often. My chest was tight and in pain. I was getting pins and needles in my arms and fingers all the time. I could not swallow anything thicker than water without feeling like I was being choked. By the 4th time I went to the ER I told them about the feeling in my throat, I told them I wasn't eating and that I had rapid weight loss -- I was dismissed. The 6th and final time I went to a third seperate hospital I cried. I told them I was so hungry but that I just couldn't eat without feeling choked. I told them I had lost 15lbs in two weeks while being bedridden. I begged to be admitted and fed through a tube. They dismissed me and told me to meet with an ENT specialist. 

The ENT specialist was shocked when she heard I hadn't been admitted. I also realized, if my mom's scale is accurate, that it was actually closer to 32lbs in 3 weeks. She sent me home with an omeprazole (40mg in the morning) and a pepcid (20mg at night) prescription that I am starting today. 

I have finally made some progress by force. I am able to drink liquids slightly thicker now without getting a full choking feeling. It's still there somewhat, but it's not as bad as solid food. I have been relying on ensure for at least some amount of calories (usually only drink one to two a day right now because the feeling is overwhelming) and I was able to get down a very simple smoothie. 

Is this choking feeling something that anyone here can relate to? It feels like someone is grabbing my throat and digging their thumbs into my thyroid area. Can you tell me it gets better? Is this some sort of weird flare up where it's happening with literally every food not just the typical acid reflux foods? 
I've never experienced this before. My acid reflux that was I was originally diagnosed with in late January of this year was just some excess mucus production when I ate chocolate. Coffee, tomatoes, oranges, everything like that were all fine. Nobody in my family has acid reflux. I never had it until this month. 

Please give me reassurance that this gets better. I feel so mistreated by the medical staff at the hospitals I went to. My weight loss is concerning and I'm always feeling hungry. On top of this there's a bunch of traumatic stuff happening in my personal life so like even mentally I'm just so exhausted. 

Also: I understand that the breathing issues are likely not reflux. I'm seeing a pulmonologist actively to figure that out. I have a steroids (oral route), a steroid inhaler I will start today, and as needed albuterol. ",2,1739904025.0,acidreflux,0,1.0,False

This has been my dream for years. I’m an eighteen year old who is about to graduate high school in three months. After I graduate my goal is to get a full-time job in a kitchen at the best restaurant/resort near me and work part-time learning the art of sushi at another restaurant.

I can’t exactly what event happened that drew me in, but it came gradually over time. Starting in early middle school into early high school I would enjoy varying flavors of both decadent dark chocolate and coffee. I yearned to taste as many dishes as possible from differing cultures of mine as I loved learning the stories behind them. A few of them being sashimi and nigiri, Pho, Kunde (a personal favorite of mine), and more.

As Covid was raging cooking was my comfort. It was my life. My time was spent watching Netflix (shows like Chef’s Table and more). In the middle of the night I’d have a show on that was a documentary series documenting the production, stories, and more of various dishes from different provinces in China. That series was a piece of art. The book that taught me how to cook was Salt Fat Acid Heat by Samin Nosrat, and I took it with my everywhere I went. 

Eventually my mental health got so bad that I lost the energy that I used to put into this art. My priorities quickly changed into learning accounting, business management, and more. This was fueled by an ego and need for financial security. I chased money. I truly lost myself in this. 

I’ve rediscovered my raging fire for the craft. Money is no longer what fuels me. As I come into my own this field calls my name. Cooking is like moving meditation for me; in a sense a form of Nirvana. 

Now for my plan:

Until I graduate I’m working at a quick service restaurant. I live in a rural area so it’s hard to fine any chef-driven restaurants where I can learn the most. Plus I can’t work much yet as I am finishing up my Payroll Accounting career training. I’m also learning QuickBooks.

Once I finally graduate my plan is to get a full-time job working at the best chef-led restaurant I can find. My goal is to move out within 8 months of graduating to an area with more opportunities.

After I move I plan on working a year while starting the process of getting into an apprenticeship with the Brightwater Culinary Arts program in Bentonville, Arkansas as it’s the best program near me.

I’m not exactly sure after I complete the apprenticeship what I’ll do. We’ll see. 

Now for my questions:

1. What advice do you have for me in my situation?

2. How did you get to where you are today? What is your story?

3. What makes you to stay in the field? If you switched, where did you go?

I am looking forward to hearing your response and what you’ve to say. It’s best to shut up and listen in order to learn. 

This is all I can see myself doing in my career. As a neurodivergent feminine presenting individual the kitchen is where I feel most at home. You work hard and earn respect. Your social status and skills don’t matter as much as long as you get along with each other. I respect what you all do! ",1,1739903975.0,Chefit,9,0.6,False

My teeth weren’t terrible, but after years of coffee and tea, they had a noticeable yellow tint. I didn’t want to pay hundreds of dollars for a professional whitening treatment, so I started looking into at-home options.

I tried whitening strips in the past, but they made my teeth feel weirdly sensitive, and I never saw dramatic results. Whitening toothpaste? Barely made a difference. That’s when I came across **Laughland teeth whitening**, which uses a **dentist-formulated whitening gel** combined with an **LED light**. It sounded more advanced than the usual over-the-counter stuff, so I figured I’d give it a shot.

Here’s how my six-day experiment went and whether or not it’s actually worth trying.

# What’s in the Laughland Teeth Whitening Kit?

When I got the kit in the mail, I appreciated how simple everything was. No extra fluff—just exactly what you need:

✔ **Whitening Gel Pens** – Super easy to use and apply without making a mess.  
✔ **LED Mouthpiece** – Activates the gel to help break down stains faster.  
✔ **Instructions** – Simple, step-by-step, no complicated process.

I liked that it didn’t come with a million steps or unnecessary accessories.

# How to Use Laughland Teeth Whitening

The whole whitening process takes **just 10 minutes a day**, which made it easy to fit into my routine.

1. **Brush & Dry Your Teeth** – Dry teeth help the gel adhere better.
2. **Apply the Gel** – Use the pen to evenly coat your teeth.
3. **Insert the LED Mouthpiece** – Turn it on, let it work for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinse & Clean** – Rinse your mouth and clean the mouthpiece.

I usually did it while scrolling my phone or watching TV, so the time passed quickly.

# Day-by-Day Results

* **Day 1:** No noticeable change, but my teeth felt extra clean.
* **Day 3:** I started seeing subtle brightening, especially around the edges.
* **Day 6:** My teeth were **6-7 shades whiter**, and the results looked **even and natural**—not fake or overly bright.

The biggest surprise? **No sensitivity at all.** Every other whitening product I’ve used made my teeth feel sensitive to hot and cold, but with Laughland, I didn’t feel a thing.

# What Makes Laughland Different?

1. **Dentist-Formulated Gel** – Strong enough to remove stains but gentle on enamel.
2. **LED Light Activation** – The blue light helps speed up the whitening process.
3. **Temperature-Controlled Ingredients** – The gel stays potent, unlike some store-bought brands that degrade over time.

**Interested in seeing if it works for you?

# How Does It Compare to Other Whitening Products?

* **Whitening Strips** – Left my teeth feeling sensitive, and the results were uneven.
* **Whitening Toothpaste** – Works for maintenance, but doesn’t actually remove deeper stains.
* **Professional Whitening** – Very effective but expensive and can cause sensitivity.

Laughland was a **good balance**—affordable, effective, and **no pain**.

# FAQs About Laughland Teeth Whitening

1. **Does it damage enamel?** – No, the gel is made to remove stains without weakening your teeth.
2. **Does it work on deep stains?** – Yes, it helped with older coffee and tea stains.
3. **How long do results last?** – This depends on your diet and oral care, but avoiding staining foods helps extend the results.

# Tips for the Best Results

✔ **Use it consistently** – Stick to the six-day plan for best results.  
✔ **Avoid staining foods** – Coffee, tea, and wine can reduce effectiveness.  
✔ **Brush & floss daily** – Keeps your teeth whiter for longer.

# Final Thoughts – Is Laughland Worth It?

For me, **Laughland teeth whitening** worked as advertised. It was easy to use, quick, and gave me noticeable results in less than a week. The **lack of sensitivity** was a huge plus, and I liked that the results looked natural rather than overly bright.

If you’ve been hesitant about teeth whitening because of cost or sensitivity, this could be a great option. It’s not as dramatic as in-office whitening, but after **six days**, I saw a real improvement.

I truly cannot stop myself from drinking. I have all the signs of alcoholism 

-drink every evening (or earlier. whatever time I get in from work, I drink. even if it is 2pm

-the amount of drinks creeping up bc of tolerance 

-thinking about it all the time 

-looking forward to social events purely for that 

-hating myself in the morning and telling myself I won’t drink again that night. but I do 

-not being able to just have one without picking up more on the way home

-waking up not being able to remember the night before 

-getting black out drunk and passing out on the floor with the room spinning 

-bargaining with myself- including the good old ‘I’ll start tomorrow’

- “it’s been a good day, I deserve a drink to celebrate” “it’s been a bad day, I need a drink to unwind”

and more 

I really have tried. I managed dry January for a few days but then I buckled again. my partner succeeded with it which I thought would help as we’d do it together, but nope. I get so pissed every night that I feel like shit. I even ask myself out loud “are you enjoying this?” and the answer is always no. In that moment I promise myself to stop because I just hate feeling so out of control and out of it. I hate not being present while spending evenings with my partner. I’m missing out on so much time. recently I’ve been falling over from drinking so much. the last time I fell into a glass coffee table and thankfully it did not smash or it would have been much worse. I’m scared for my liver and general health 

I don’t need anybody to tell me I have a problem, it’s clear that I do. but I truly don’t know how I can get through this. I do not want to go to my doctor about it for a few reasons that I don’t want to lay out here 

I just can’t see myself ever breaking this cycle. today I woke up nauseous and not knowing what happened the night before. I was so anxious and ashamed that I said to myself “ok, none tonight” then it was “well actually I’ve got half a bottle in the cupboard so I’ll just finish that” and before I know it I’m in the shop buying more. 

I went to work today thinking “yep, not tonight” but as the day went on my thoughts went from that, to “although maybe just a little bit so I’m doing it in moderation” to “I could just finish that bottle of wine” “but that will end up with me going to the shop anyway so I may as well get another bottle on my way home”

I have a few mental health conditions and so for as long as I can remember I’ve been self destructive in various ways, but this really has gone too far. I’m working on quite a bit of it in therapy (not the drinking directly, because they offer this therapy on the condition that you’re not drinking excessively). working on trauma and my conditions in general, but I’ve gone past the point of drinking to cope with all of that. it’s now just drinking to feel pissed and of course the alcohol makes my mental health, self harm and suicidal thoughts much worse 

I’ve tried writing reasons to stop drinking and it just isn’t enough. for my partner, my job, my dogs, my parents, my health etc etc. it just is never enough to stop me 

please, please someone help me. 
I feel completely helpless and alone. 
I don’t know what to do anymore because I just keep failing with this. 
I need a way out but I just can’t find one. 
I am so ashamed of myself

On the other hand, it is still the same amount of calories per day and I feel it will help to become a sustainable practice as I am prone to acidity and migraines. Black coffee really helps cut hunger but I get acidity to the point of vomiting if I drink strong black coffee.

I bought a ZP6 S 35 days ago, went through 6 bags of 250g of coffee (washed, natural, fermented.... from light to medium dark roasts). Nailed every one of them using my baratza encore, but failed on the ZP6 S. Theres always a problem. Some times bitterness, others astringency, hollow... Its driving me crazy.

I use a plastic V60, with Hario 02 white filters, 0.1 precision scale with flow rate and a good goose neck kettle. (I have been using this set up for over 8 years)

Methods: Hoffmans 1 better cup, 4:6 and Hendricks.

I produced lovely cups with the baratza encore. Failed to produce at least 1 cuo with the ZP6 S.

I need some advice, hear some experiences, anything at all from ZP6 owners.

Im gonna show some pictures of grind size at 5.5. My burr lock is at 0 (cant go pass it). At 10 clicks theres no burr rub (1zpresso confirmed that it tells me that theres no problems with the burr alignment)

For the love of Coffee, give me your method, your advice on everything... brew ratio, water temperature, bloom, pour method, policial party, what shares you have, sexual preferences. Yes, im loosing my mind! I accept videos, written methods, general advices, money, debit and credit card.

Basically, what I planned to do was volunteer at a wildlife sanctuary that's also a hostel and let's you stay there. It said when I booked it that they give you 3 meals a day as well, and a welcome package with a few gifts 

I'm here now 
I felt pretty horrible about it all before I left the UK, and when I was on my flight to San Jose, I was told really last minute that the hostel was overbooked even though I'd booked a place months ago. A driver took me to the hotel, and when I got there, it was not in good shape. The coffee machine is absolutely dirty with hairs in it and it's sticky to pick up, the drawers on the wardrobe are hanging off, 3 out of 9 lights in the room will actually work, there's not any hot water, and there's actually been tons of insects in the bed, like where I'm supposed to lie down and sleep. More about the bed, there's not a duvet, so I covered myself with a blanket to sleep. I was freezing and there isn't any heating in my room. There is a bath in the room, that also has no got water, and I actually found it with pubes on it.

Also, because I was told there'd be 3 meals a day, I haven't been given any breakfast, any dinner at all. 

Outside the hotel room, while I'm walking outside, people on motorbikes have been rude and held their fingers up at me and staring a lot while I'm just minding my own business. 

And there's this feeling in me that I don't know how to describe but I want to leave. I feel absolutely sick to my stomach being here, and I miss my routine back where I live
It probably sounds really stupid but at home I have a routine where I look after my mental health and try really hard to show myself kindness and look after my body, and coming here I'm not really able to stay in my routine and I think that's part of what's making me feel awful

I feel dreadful in my stomach and want to go back where I actually feel a bit welcome
I also didn't see that welcome package 

I don't even feel like I'm up for eating anything anyway, and can barely work myself up to leave the room
I feel really lonely and want to go

1isjn1q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1isjn1q,Apps I Think Are Great,"I really like my iPad Mini 6, I use it everyday and it's one of my favourite objects. Below are some apps I find useful. 

Habit Tracker: track things app

I tried several habit tracking apps and I thought this was the one with the most value. I’ve been using it to log stuff for 2 years now. 

I can create any habit I want, specify no. of times I want to do it in a day, how often, set reminder notifications, add a memo on completion, etc. All habit trackers prob do this but this app does it pretty well imo. I also linked it to my Health app so it tracks all the daily steps I am not taking enough of. There’s a timer for habits and a mood tracker also. The widgets are great and interactive.

The UI is simple and attractive. There are graphs and those year in pixel grids so I can check for trends. Has my period been regular? Have I been taking my daily vitamins lately? During which months do I regularly meet my daily step quota? Some real riveting stuff. 

The price is really reasonable too, I purchased the lifetime premium membership for like $9 in 2023 and I don’t regret it. 

Cons: 

It does everything I wanted it to do so not much to say.

MyNetDiary: calorie counting app

I love logging things so naturally I have been all bricked up over recording every morsel that passes my lips and every single glass of water I drink (help) since I got this app. 

I started using this app to assist in my weight gain goals like the number of calories I should be eating and whatever. I’ve actually found it helpful because it makes me conscious of skipping meals bc I don’t have anything to log :( so I eat something. The app is also linked to the Health app so the data flows to the Habits app and logs my water drinking there too.

I can add custom foods with their calorie count, nutrients, etc or search it up in the food library thing. There’s a feature to scan barcodes too, it works only occasionally for me tho prob bc I don’t live in the US.

There’s a premium monthly subscription for some not terribly exorbitant price, but I’m currently in my Poor Era (2023 CE to 2025 CE) so I’m perfectly satisfied with the F2P version of the app. 

Con: 

I do have to add the water intake manually, it seems. Like I can’t just log 2 ½ cups of coffee and expect the water intake to auto inc as well. I tried another app before this that did that and it seems like a QOL improvement. Well, maybe it's a premium feature and I’m too poor to know. 

Noteful: note-taking

My preferred note-taking app. One time purchase of $4.99 and there’s cloud sync to my phone. There’s an in-app timer. I believe you can add audio recordings too though I’ve never tried. Just as good as the competitors imo (I have Nebo too). 

Much preferable to physical notebooks since I can move stuff around, undo my mistakes, and not feel like I want to rewrite the whole page bc it looks ugly. I’m trying to learn cursive so I made my own page template with 60 degree slanted guidelines to help me. 

No cons for the price. 

Reminders: you add shit to a list and it reminds you about it if you want

Great for making to do lists with repeating or future tasks since I can make it show up in the Calendar too. I migrated all my lists from Notes, like my grocery shopping list. Also it's free, that's beautiful. 

I added a shortcut to my home screen so I can easily add reminders in a dropdown list too. 

Cons: 

The Smart List should probably be able to do more tbh, the complexity of the filters you can use is kinda limited. 
Can I pls get the big big widget option for this app? The widgets kind of suck at showing any detailed info, not even the dates and times of reminders, I have to rely on the Calendars app for that.

So I wanted to offer some ideas!! 
First was really just getting to my 3 star island, I did this about 3 days ago and unlocked the kk concert.
Most of that was just planting alot of trees and building fences and small yards around my islanders houses, adding flowers to those yards. 
What I see now is nothing I really planted and went crazy on has to stay, I just needed to get to that 3 star level 
Next was unlocking terraforming, incredibly overwhelming right??? Well actually not as crazy as you think, I looked up a lot of creator codes for just paths I wanted to start out with and really what I’m gonna do is work on my island piece by piece. Currently planning an orchard for my fruit trees. A easy to manage task and the vibe of that can roll into the rest of my terraforming. 
Today I unlocked boat tours and expanding harvs island, I still don’t have the coffee shop but I know it’s coming at some point.
All this was to say DONT GET BOGGED DOWN I think there’s the most repetitive feeling getting to the 3 stars because of the grind but then theres a lot of game after that. I also watch people build there islands on YouTube for a lot for inspo 🫡

1isjjdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1isjjdq/my_adhd_almost_got_me_arrested/,My ADHD almost got me arrested.,"I started medication for ADHD and anxiety almost a month ago. I'm on a non-stimulant and it's been doing wonders for me. However, things from my pre-medicine days are still catching up to me. Case in freaking point:

Two days ago I'm driving home after quickly grabbing coffee for my husband and me. It's early, I'm not dressed for the weather, and a snowstorm is brewing. It's not an excuse for rolling a stop sign, but it's what I did as I rushed to get home. I got pulled over less than a block from home and was kicking myself for being so dumb. It took a while for the officer to bring me the ticket, and it's because apparently when he looked up my information he found a warrant issued for my arrest.

A warrant. Me. The person who got one speeding ticket in college and spends most of her free time doing puzzles and watching regency dramas. I was shocked and confused. Another officer arrived and asked for my emergency contact information and to pull off to a less busy road, and I thought- I'm literally about to be arrested and I have no idea what I could have done. 

Thank god, my sister is an attorney. I call her crying and she stays on the phone with me. Eventually, the first officer comes back and explains that he doesn't recognize the warrant- something about theft of loaned or entrusted items. He asks if this rings any bells, and of course, it doesn't. He says that he can tell I'm shaken and confused, so he lets me go home without even a warning for rolling the stop sign because ""you have bigger fish to fry"". I'm extremely grateful and inch my way home. 

My sister explains that it's a misdemeanor, it may carry a year in jail time, and there will definitely be a hefty fine. But she promises to help me figure it out and avoid jail. We're still super confused as to what's going on. The next day is a holiday, so the court is closed, but she says she'll call when they're open and submit herself on my behalf as my attorney and find out what she can.

A few hours later the officer calls me and says he dug into it- library books. I have five library books overdue by three months. And then I rememeber- in my trunk is the bag of books I keep meaning to return but have clearly forgotten about. 

Library. Books. I never received a notice that they'd put a warrant out for me, by mail, phone, or emai.

This isn't totally sorted yet. We're having a snowstorm, so the courts are closed. My court date is early April, so there's time, but I'll be nauseous until it's over. I don't have to go to court thanks to my sister, and she knows the prosecutor and fully believes she will work it out. 

But oh my god. My ADHD almost got me arrested. If the officer wasn't as kind, I'd be sitting in jail through this snowstorm with no idea why I was sitting there.

The only thing missing is a nice good tamper, i mastered the small little breville one but i dont like that it leaves crumbs on the side.

I’m so happy i tried this bomber puck screen because i was reading its almost 60/40 people that loves them vs people doesn’t see any difference. I’m with the 60 % because i saw the difference right away (water distribution which increases the taste, dryer puck and clean head). The puck screen always sticks the the ground puck but i saw someone that had a good idea to use a magnet so I’ll be trying that soon. Tried my new pesado kit for the first time this morning wich the new bottomless portafilter with the high efficiency 18-20g basket and the wdt that matches. They’re not cheap but honestly worth it. I feel the quality of the products, very sturdy and i love the look. To use the h/e basket i had to go finer again so I’m at the finer settings of this machine 1 and 1. I know apparently it’s not ideal to max it out but it’s the only way i get my grind fine enough to get my 1:2 ratio.

So you dont need to wait when you start up the machine. The only con i find is the grinder. When I’ll have my space I’ll definitely go for a eureka mignon or something similar.

The city’s evening lights shimmered over the backwaters, and after a long day, I decided to unwind at a rooftop bar overlooking the water.

That’s where I saw her.

She was sitting alone at the bar, her fingers lazily tracing the rim of her glass. Long, dark hair fell over her shoulder, and the way she carried herself—confident yet distant—was intriguing. I ordered my drink, stealing a glance in her direction. Our eyes met, and she held my gaze for a second longer than necessary before smirking and looking away.

I took that as an invitation.

“Are you waiting for someone?” I asked, settling onto the stool beside her.

She turned to me, her eyes playful. “Not anymore.”

Her name was Ananya. She was in town for a short break, escaping the monotony of routine. We talked about travel, late-night drives, and the best hidden food joints in Kerala. The conversation flowed effortlessly, the kind where time slips away without notice.

When it was time to leave, we walked along the waterfront, the cool breeze carrying the scent of the sea. The city lights reflected in the water, and for a moment, everything felt beautifully still.

By morning, the golden sunlight streamed through the curtains of my hotel room, casting a glow over the quiet city.

Hello, I'm planning on re-doing my small living room with new decor and furniture. The house was built in the 1950s and later renovated so the room is set up a bit awkwardly, with the 2 doors at one corner and the hallway entrance on the opposite wall. The dimensions of the room are 13.5 feet by 12.5 feet. I cannot move my gas heater but pretty much everything else is fair game. 

I wanted to go for a more mid-century/maximalist look, with warmer wood tones, thrifted furniture/wall decor and pops of color to contrast with the millennial gray carpet and walls the house was renovated with. I was planning on getting a new TV stand, bookcase, coffee table and possibly a couch. For the TV stand I was going to get a warmer toned wood, mount the TV, put my speakers on either side of the TV stand and use the stand to house my stereo equipment. I want to get some ceiling-to-floor curtains for the window but was unsure on the style and color. I had a big Persian rug in mind for the floor to go under the couch

I'd welcome any feedback or recommendations for curtains, how to space the furniture so the room doesn't feel cramped, wall decor or anything else really. Thank y'all in advance.",1,1739902320.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False
