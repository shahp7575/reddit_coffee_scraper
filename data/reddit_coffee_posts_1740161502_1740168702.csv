1iv0c6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1iv0c6a/my_18m_girlfriend_19f_thinks_my_professors_brief/,My (18M) Girlfriend (19F) Thinks My Professor’s Brief Farewell Hug Was 'Cheating',"**TL;DR :** My professor, whom I deeply respect, was leaving our college. During her farewell, she hugged several students, including me (a brief, formal hug). I instinctively stepped back, feeling uncomfortable since I wasn’t raised with that norm. Later, I told my girlfriend about it, expressing my discomfort. However, she got upset, ghosted me, and eventually accused me of ""cheating."" She brought up past incidents where she felt I was too close to other girls (including a ""sister"" figure I had to cut off for her). Now, I’m emotionally drained, confused, and don’t know what to do.

So, recently, one of my professors—probably in her late twenties or early thirties—was leaving our college. I had studied under her for six months and had developed immense respect for her. She introduced me to philosophy (for which I’ll always be indebted to her), and we often held Marxism discussions in class. She also helped me improve my speaking skills during vivas. Overall, she was one of the best teachers I’ve ever had. And she also claimed that I am one of her favorite students.

At her farewell, which was attended by around 50 of my batchmates (both guys and girls), she was taking pictures with everyone. I didn’t go for an individual photo because, honestly, I respect her too much for that. After the pictures, she asked me, “Adamya, let’s go get some food for your batchmates.” I agreed, and we hopped in her car.

On the way, she started asking about my parents and my future plans. I answered respectfully, sitting quietly in the shotgun seat with my hands on my knees. She also mentioned that she was leaving college because she was getting married (which she had actually announced earlier, but I hadn’t been paying attention). She told me about her fiancé while we were on the way.

When we got to the shop, we bought some food, and she casually offered me a dhokla. We ate one together while she continued talking about her fiancé, and to be honest, I was getting really bored. But anyway, we got the food, headed back, and served it to our batchmates.

Then came the emotional part—she started crying because one of my batchmates gave her a beautifully designed, handwritten letter with a coffee-stained effect and burned edges. As she got emotional, she began hugging all the girls one by one.

Now, here’s the thing—I stepped back because that’s just not something I was raised with or ever exposed to. I didn’t acknowledge this “tradition” of hugging professors, especially since my way of showing respect is different. So, I waited until the emotional moment passed, then walked up, touched her feet, and said, “Thank you, ma’am.” She appreciated it, and I thanked her again.

She then went back to hugging some girl, and I turned around to leave. I had barely taken two steps when she suddenly called my name. Before I could fully turn, she stepped forward and gave me one of those formal hugs. Reflexively, I took two steps back, breaking it. I don’t know if she noticed, but she just said, “Thank you for organizing this” and “Bye.” And that was it.

But after that, I felt weird. Almost disgusted, even. Like, I was supposed to touch her feet—that’s what felt right. This wasn’t. And it hit me later that the only reason I felt this way was because I had never been introduced to such a notion before. And frankly, I never will be. Also, I wasn’t even the first guy she hugged that night.

Later that night, I told my long-distance girlfriend (19F, we’ve been together for almost a year) about what happened. I explained how the whole thing felt wrong to me. **(And just to be clear—I AM NOT CONSERVATIVE. I just never knew about this, okay? I’m sorry.)**

Anyway, after I told her, she suddenly cut the call, giving some BS excuse, and then refused to sleep on call with me (which is rare). The next morning, she ignored me completely. Ghosted me the entire day. When I kept asking what was wrong—literally begging her to tell me—she still wouldn’t say. And after pushing for hours, I finally realized this all started after last night’s conversation.

She was being cold, rude, and repeatedly saying, “You’re annoying me.” That was her only reason. Then she started blocking me, switching off her phone, and just avoiding me. I didn’t understand, so I just resorted to doing sit-ups and writing her a long paragraph about how much I love her. When she finally responded, she just said, “I love you” for a second before going back to “Your voice annoys me.”

Then, just 15 minutes ago, after even more begging and near-crying, she finally admitted, “It’s amusing how you didn’t find a problem with that.”

I was confused. I told her I DID have a problem with it. That it disgusted me, that it pained me, and that I even told her last night in detail how I felt. But she just said, “No, you didn’t.”

I insisted that I did, but she just cut the call again. She had to go celebrate her roommate’s birthday or something, but she said she’d be back soon. Right before leaving, she used the word “cheating” to describe what happened.

And now I’m just… shook. I feel so wrong. She even started bringing up past instances of my so-called “cheating.” Like, for example, once, I sent 10 voice notes to a girl I considered my sister (not biologically, but we had a sibling bond—she even called me *bhaiya* (hindi for brother)). She was really depressed after getting bad 12th-grade results and not getting into any colleges, so I was just trying to be there for her.

But my girlfriend told me this was wrong. That I “couldn’t have these so-called ‘sisters.’” She said, “Men’s intentions are always bad” (which, to be fair, she says because every guy who’s been her ‘brother’ eventually ended up confessing to her). She insisted that this wasn’t right and that it made her uncomfortable.

It took me 2-3 days of crying and begging for her to forgive me. I promised never to do it again. I even blocked that girl completely. She tried reaching out on different platforms, asking what happened, but I never replied. And just to clarify—this was someone I actually considered family. I had even introduced her to my girlfriend at the start of our relationship. She even sent me a rakhi (a bracelet or string that a sister ties on her brother's wrist).

But what gets me is that my girlfriend STILL has a so-called “brother.” He sends her reels and stuff. And when I pointed it out, she just said, “He doesn’t send me 10 voice notes or anything. He’s not as close to me as you were to her.”

So yeah. That’s where I am right now. Just sitting here. And yes, I know myself—I’ll probably go and beg her some more, apologizing for something I don’t even understand.

I even told her—she was my professor. I couldn’t just *push her away.* My girlfriend said, **“I knew you were gonna use that excuse, which is why I didn’t tell you about this before. I was trying to fix this insecurity of mine alone.”**

I’m just emotionally drained at this point.

I have been observing this sub for a while and just want to mention a few things.
I'm from abroad, but have taught English in Spain, Catalunya specifically for over 25 years now. 
I have worked in the Secondary School sector, and worked with people just like you, as well as getting to know numerous more aux folks over the years. That's why I follow the sub. 
In short, most of the classroom problems you face are down to the fact that the system has no idea how to use you. 

Ni puta idea. 

For every teacher that is pleased to have you around, and genuinely wants you and the students to have a good time, even if they don't exactly know how to make it work, there are half dozen genuinely nasty, incompetent, insecure, embittered sacks of shit that make your life miserable just so they can feel a slight bit less dead. They will blame you for everything, criticize everything you try, do nothing to help you, everything to hinder you, and treat you like you are mentally deficient. 

F*ck these people. 

I have improvised some awesome classes with my aux teachers, had a ball, laughed our asses off and gone for a coffee, then seen you walking the corridors, waiting to be called into a class, left hanging cos the class isn't happening and the teacher said nothing to you. I've heard teachers bad-mouthing you in the staff room, blaming lack of progress on you. 

The program is not supposed to be a holiday, sure, and first time teaching is destined to be a bumpy ride, of course, but you people have to tolerate some really stupid bullshit. 

For the record, never once, in all these years and all these aux teachers, have I heard a student complain. You make more of a difference than any of your so-called superior can ever bring themselves to admit. 

You are never the problem.

Currently, I'm 36 years old and live in a group home in San Diego, California. I live a good life in the group home and am able to come and go as I please to places like the coffee shop/library/etc. I have autism and ADHD. 

I've been noticing how expensive it is to live in California and have been considering the idea of moving to Illinois. Specifically either the Champaign/Urbana area or Bloomington/Normal area. Both are college towns and while I have no intentions on attending college, the robust bus systems in those cities and shorter commute times really appeal to me considering I don't drive. I hear Chicago has a good bus system too but those dozens and dozens of suburbs seem intimidating to me whenever I look at Google Maps. Almost like a midwestern labyrinth I could easily get lost in. 

Does anyone know what the disability services and programs there are like? Are they better or worse than California? I know its a blue state like California so high taxes are to be expected but from what I understand, most non-Chicago cities in Illinois are affordable by comparison. Also, I'm hesitant to look into red state alternatives considering I'm also queer on top of being disabled. Even if I was born in Nebraska and lived there til I was 9, I have no intention of returning there unless its to visit family or old friends.

I've got 10 HDs (127 TB total).  8 HDs are connected to a Dell HBA SAS card.  2 HDs are connected directly to the MB via SATA ports.I use Stablebit Drivepool & Scanner to manage the HD pool.

Everything has been good for the past two years until last week.  HDs are sporadically disconnecting.  I'll reseat the power & SATA cables and hope that they reconnect.  On some, I've swapped SATA cables as well.  Most of the time they do reconnect but these HDs are making me pull my hair.  As you can imagine, this is a wiry mess (8 breakout cables, 10 SATA power cables & 2 SATA cables).  Once reconnected, I'm afraid to breathe near them, lol.  Even afraid to look at them, lol, hoping they stay connected.

I've wondered if I'd be better off getting two 8-bay DAS enclosures.The SAS card is rated to 6 Gbps (8 HDs) and the DAS is rated to 10 Gbps (16 HDs between the two DAS enclosures).

I love that the HDs connect directly to the DAS backplane (no wires).  Each DAS will have just one power cord and one USB C cable.  Also, speed shouldn't be an issue as USB 3.2 is faster than my current SAS card.

I purchased this table for $65 and plan to refinish it.

I’m wondering if you think this is a reproduction (based on the legs and the joinery from the underside). 

I plan on keeping it, but just wondering if I’m working on a collector’s item or a nice piece that I won’t mind putting a drink on top of without a coaster :)

\[Opening shot: The Nostalgia Critic stands in front of a generic movie theater backdrop. He’s holding a DVD case labeled \*Megalopolis\*.\]



\*\*Nostalgia Critic:\*\*  

\*Hey, everyone! Nostalgia Critic here. I remember it so you don't have to!\* … Except when I \*do\* have to. This is a movie I wish I could forget, but alas, my brain has been forever scarred by it. Today, we’re talking about \*Megalopolis\*, the cinematic fever dream of a film that I can only describe as a battle between George Lucas, Ridley Scott, and someone who had \*way\* too much coffee at 3 in the morning.



\[Cut to the movie poster for \*Megalopolis\*.\]



\*\*Nostalgia Critic (voiceover):\*\*  

\*The story? Oh, let me tell you. It's... It's about... well, something. Set in a dystopian future... or is it a utopia? Maybe it’s both. Who cares? It's really hard to say!\*



\[Cut to Critic, staring at the camera.\]



\*\*Nostalgia Critic:\*\*  

The movie begins with a ridiculous concept: an ambitious attempt to create a \*new\* city, \*Megalopolis\*, from the ground up. And I know what you’re thinking—this sounds \*kinda cool, right?\* Well, imagine if someone tried to remake \*Blade Runner\*... but with all the depth of a soap opera that no one’s been watching for the last 10 years. That’s \*Megalopolis\* for you!



\[Cut to random chaotic action shots from the film.\]



\*\*Nostalgia Critic (voiceover):\*\*  

The film introduces us to a bunch of characters who are either over-the-top, completely underdeveloped, or simply here to make the city look like a set for a low-budget video game. You've got politicians, scientists, rich people, poor people... basically every type of person who would logically be in a sprawling city, but none of them feel like they’re from the same world. It’s like the movie can’t decide if it wants to be \*Dune\*, \*The Matrix\*, or the \*Fast & Furious\* series. In fact, I think at one point, a car chases down a giant robot... or was that just my dream after watching this mess? \*Who knows?!\*



\[Cut to a clip of the robot scene.\]



\*\*Nostalgia Critic (voiceover):\*\*  

But oh, \*that\* scene… It’s bad, folks. The CGI is... let’s just say it looks like it was designed by someone who never learned what CGI was in the first place. And while we're at it, the visual effects are absolutely \*laughable.\* The city’s architecture tries so hard to look futuristic that it goes full circle and becomes something from the 1990s. Like, this is the kind of city that looks cool if you’re \*14\* and just got your hands on a copy of \*Autodesk Maya\*. But by the time the movie rolls around, all those cool floating platforms just look like unnecessary eye candy trying way too hard.



\[Cut to Critic shaking his head.\]



\*\*Nostalgia Critic:\*\*  

And then there’s the \*dialogue\*... Oh, the dialogue. I’ve seen more nuanced conversations between action figures. It's filled with all these grand speeches about the future of humanity, philosophical questions about progress, and discussions of utopias and dystopias. Which sounds \*great\*—if it wasn’t being delivered by people who look like they’re reading off cue cards in a windstorm. At one point, the protagonist (played by an actor who is definitely trying their best, but no one can escape the nonsense they're given) says something like, ""We must build something better, or we’ll \*destroy\* ourselves!"" \*Well, yeah, Captain Obvious, you think?!\*



\[Cut to a clip where the protagonist delivers this line in a dramatic tone.\]



\*\*Nostalgia Critic (voiceover):\*\*  

The acting, by the way, fluctuates between a \*C-list community theater performance\* and “are we sure this is a professional set?” I don’t think I’ve ever seen a cast look so lost in a movie. Everyone seems like they’re just there because they got lost on the way to another film. Some of the performances are so flat, I half-expected them to break out into a version of \*The Room\*.



\[Cut to a quick montage of actors looking confused and delivering lines poorly.\]



\*\*Nostalgia Critic:\*\*  

There’s also this \*weird\* love triangle subplot that adds absolutely nothing to the movie. It's like the filmmakers thought, “You know what \*Megalopolis\* needs? A romance!” And the characters involved are just so out of place, it feels like watching a bad soap opera between two people who don't seem to even know each other.



\[Cut to an awkward romantic moment between two characters.\]



\*\*Nostalgia Critic:\*\*  

\*Oof.\* So yeah, the plot is a mess. The visuals are confusing. The acting is all over the place. But wait! What about the \*message\*? Oh, there’s a message alright. A \*deep\* one. The movie tries to get all philosophical on us with some \*big\* questions about technology, social structures, and what happens when you try to play god with people's lives. But the movie’s themes are so muddled that it’s hard to even care. By the time it wraps up, you just want it all to end, like a bad sci-fi series you’re forced to binge-watch and then pretend you never did.



\[Cut to the Critic standing in front of the poster again.\]



\*\*Nostalgia Critic:\*\*  

\*In the end, Megalopolis\* isn’t just a movie, it’s an experience. One where you ask yourself, “Why am I still watching this?” It’s like a bad art project someone spent 30 years on and then said, “We can totally release this, people will get it.” But no, no we don’t. And frankly, I’m glad it’s over. \*Megalopolis\* is \*big\*, loud, and completely forgettable. And that’s the biggest crime it could commit. So, in the words of someone who clearly doesn’t get it, \*“We must rise above... or fall to our doom!”\*



\[Cut to the Critic dramatically raising his hand in the air.\]



\*\*Nostalgia Critic:\*\*  

\*And by ""rise above,"" I mean... not watch this again.\* 



\[The Critic winks and walks off-screen. The credits roll.\]



\*\*Nostalgia Critic (voiceover):\*\*  

Megalopolis. \*Only if you want to lose two hours of your life...\*

My depression & anxiety is currently managed with Wellbutrin and Sertraline. Setraline does make me groggy, so I take it around 10pm. I have low vitamin D, and have started supplements for that which seem to have helped. I have some teeth grinding issues that seem to get better since starting magnesium. Currently at a healthy but low BMI. These adjustments seem to help slightly, but I still sleep so much. I basically feel like I need 9 hours of sleep to function without napping, and I usually nap after work every single day for about 3 hours. On my days off, I sleep in. I'm constantly tired and drinking coffee throughout the day to stay alert. I'm getting bloodwork done on my thyroid and other vitamin levels to figure out if there's any underlying issue.

I know I am not active enough, I live a pretty sedentary life. I love running, but only run during the warmer seasons and that seems to be the times I'm most active. (Though after running, I ususally take a nap lol)

I am leaning towards this just becoming a bad habit of mine, and I'm giving into the sleepiness. When I feel it coming on it feels impossible to stay awake, but starting next week I want to change drastically. I want to start waking up at 7am every day next week, and to avoid naps altogether. I'm sick of feeling like I'm wasting my years away sleeping and napping and I want to be more disciplined and stick to schedules and routine rather than just giving in every time I'm sleepy. I'm sick of feeling like there isn't enough hours in the day to get anything done, which in turn makes me feel anxious and depressed. It's a vicious cycle I'm in.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00-19.30. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

1iuzg7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1iuzg7y/my_18m_girlfriend_19f_thinks_my_professors_brief/,My (18M) Girlfriend (19F) Thinks My Professor’s Brief Farewell Hug Was 'Cheating',"**TL;DR :** My professor, whom I deeply respect, was leaving our college. During her farewell, she hugged several students, including me (a brief, formal hug). I instinctively stepped back, feeling uncomfortable since I wasn’t raised with that norm. Later, I told my girlfriend about it, expressing my discomfort. However, she got upset, ghosted me, and eventually accused me of ""cheating."" She brought up past incidents where she felt I was too close to other girls (including a ""sister"" figure I had to cut off for her). Now, I’m emotionally drained, confused, and don’t know what to do.

So, recently, one of my professors—probably in her late twenties or early thirties—was leaving our college. I had studied under her for six months and had developed immense respect for her. She introduced me to philosophy (for which I’ll always be indebted to her), and we often held Marxism discussions in class. She also helped me improve my speaking skills during vivas. Overall, she was one of the best teachers I’ve ever had. And she also claimed that I am one of her favorite students.

At her farewell, which was attended by around 50 of my batchmates (both guys and girls), she was taking pictures with everyone. I didn’t go for an individual photo because, honestly, I respect her too much for that. After the pictures, she asked me, “Adamya, let’s go get some food for your batchmates.” I agreed, and we hopped in her car.

On the way, she started asking about my parents and my future plans. I answered respectfully, sitting quietly in the shotgun seat with my hands on my knees. She also mentioned that she was leaving college because she was getting married (which she had actually announced earlier, but I hadn’t been paying attention). She told me about her fiancé while we were on the way.

When we got to the shop, we bought some food, and she casually offered me a dhokla. We ate one together while she continued talking about her fiancé, and to be honest, I was getting really bored. But anyway, we got the food, headed back, and served it to our batchmates.

Then came the emotional part—she started crying because one of my batchmates gave her a beautifully designed, handwritten letter with a coffee-stained effect and burned edges. As she got emotional, she began hugging all the girls one by one.

Now, here’s the thing—I stepped back because that’s just not something I was raised with or ever exposed to. I didn’t acknowledge this “tradition” of hugging professors, especially since my way of showing respect is different. So, I waited until the emotional moment passed, then walked up, touched her feet, and said, “Thank you, ma’am.” She appreciated it, and I thanked her again.

She then went back to hugging some girl, and I turned around to leave. I had barely taken two steps when she suddenly called my name. Before I could fully turn, she stepped forward and gave me one of those formal hugs. Reflexively, I took two steps back, breaking it. I don’t know if she noticed, but she just said, “Thank you for organizing this” and “Bye.” And that was it.

But after that, I felt weird. Almost disgusted, even. Like, I was supposed to touch her feet—that’s what felt right. This wasn’t. And it hit me later that the only reason I felt this way was because I had never been introduced to such a notion before. And frankly, I never will be. Also, I wasn’t even the first guy she hugged that night.

Later that night, I told my long-distance girlfriend (19F, we’ve been together for almost a year) about what happened. I explained how the whole thing felt wrong to me. **(And just to be clear—I AM NOT CONSERVATIVE. I just never knew about this, okay? I’m sorry.)**

Anyway, after I told her, she suddenly cut the call, giving some BS excuse, and then refused to sleep on call with me (which is rare). The next morning, she ignored me completely. Ghosted me the entire day. When I kept asking what was wrong—literally begging her to tell me—she still wouldn’t say. And after pushing for hours, I finally realized this all started after last night’s conversation.

She was being cold, rude, and repeatedly saying, “You’re annoying me.” That was her only reason. Then she started blocking me, switching off her phone, and just avoiding me. I didn’t understand, so I just resorted to doing sit-ups and writing her a long paragraph about how much I love her. When she finally responded, she just said, “I love you” for a second before going back to “Your voice annoys me.”

Then, just 15 minutes ago, after even more begging and near-crying, she finally admitted, “It’s amusing how you didn’t find a problem with that.”

I was confused. I told her I DID have a problem with it. That it disgusted me, that it pained me, and that I even told her last night in detail how I felt. But she just said, “No, you didn’t.”

I insisted that I did, but she just cut the call again. She had to go celebrate her roommate’s birthday or something, but she said she’d be back soon. Right before leaving, she used the word “cheating” to describe what happened.

And now I’m just… shook. I feel so wrong. She even started bringing up past instances of my so-called “cheating.” Like, for example, once, I sent 10 voice notes to a girl I considered my sister (not biologically, but we had a sibling bond—she even called me *bhaiya* (hindi for brother)). She was really depressed after getting bad 12th-grade results and not getting into any colleges, so I was just trying to be there for her.

But my girlfriend told me this was wrong. That I “couldn’t have these so-called ‘sisters.’” She said, “Men’s intentions are always bad” (which, to be fair, she says because every guy who’s been her ‘brother’ eventually ended up confessing to her). She insisted that this wasn’t right and that it made her uncomfortable.

It took me 2-3 days of crying and begging for her to forgive me. I promised never to do it again. I even blocked that girl completely. She tried reaching out on different platforms, asking what happened, but I never replied. And just to clarify—this was someone I actually considered family. I had even introduced her to my girlfriend at the start of our relationship. She even sent me a rakhi (a bracelet or string that a sister ties on her brother's wrist).

But what gets me is that my girlfriend STILL has a so-called “brother.” He sends her reels and stuff. And when I pointed it out, she just said, “He doesn’t send me 10 voice notes or anything. He’s not as close to me as you were to her.”

So yeah. That’s where I am right now. Just sitting here. And yes, I know myself—I’ll probably go and beg her some more, apologizing for something I don’t even understand.

I even told her—she was my professor. I couldn’t just *push her away.* My girlfriend said, **“I knew you were gonna use that excuse, which is why I didn’t tell you about this before. I was trying to fix this insecurity of mine alone.”**

I’m just emotionally drained at this point.

Yesterday, we hung out all day at a amusement park. Just us. And I was hoping to talk a bit about some truths, boundaries. But we didnt. I didnt want to make things awkward. I think she would say she's engaged if I asked. But she also avoids talking about him to me. 

Cause when she picked me up (I can drive, but it worked out better she drove) she got a call from ""Baby"" and she quickly ended the call and texted him. But she talks to her sister on the phone. 

Her relationship is currently long distance. Hey, if he's okay with me - more power to them. But I don't know if he knows just as how she doesnt tell me about him.

We didn't talk about boundaries, her fiance or my own feelings about her but I did try to make the first step towards defining our friendship moving forward by saying we have a ""close cousins"" type of relationship. She agreed.",1,1740166250.0,AskMenAdvice,7,1.0,False

I'm very surprised when I wasn't able to find anything about this project here via Google as I get most of my information about espresso from here. It's about a DIY project which makes it possible for anyone (with some tech knowledge) to upgrade their espresso machine to a smart coffee robot with features such as flow control, timers, sensors, etc. As far as I understood, it can be used on almost any machine. Here's the link to the project:

https://www.schematix.co.nz/forum/how-to-s/smart-coffee-arduino-mega-version

Here a video on YouTube about it:

https://youtu.be/4V0a9dfkx9Q?si=UHeS04LFaf4XJSsV

Over the link you can also find a shop to buy needed board as well as links to AliExpress for the sensors. The price is around 350-400 Euro with everything included I think. 

I'm posting this here because I wanted to ask if anyone already installed this or something similar on their machine and could give some feedback on how well it works, if it was worth it, etc. I'm excited to hear what people here say about the project. 

Cheers guys and have a good weekend!",1,1740166063.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

It’s not a town people move to, or move away from. It just is, a little pocket of civilization swallowed by hills and trees, with a main road that only goes one way in and one way out. We don’t have internet, not in the way most people do. Cell service is unreliable at best. If you want to talk to someone, you call their landline.  
  
And if you wanted to have talking points with your friends, you turn on the radio.  
  
Our little AM/FM station, 97.3 Hollow Radio, is how most people in town keep up with the world beyond our hills. It plays local news, weather updates, music- whatever keeps people entertained while they work. It’s the sound of the town itself, always playing in the background.  
  
That’s why, when the signal appeared, we all noticed.  
  
It wasn’t an announcement or even a normal broadcast. It was a song.  
  
A single, eerie melody looping over and over.  
  
At first, it was so faint I thought my radio was acting up. It began as a soft hum beneath the usual noise. But day by day, it got louder.  
  
Until it was everywhere.  
  
I heard it while I was closing up at the office.  
  
The Hollow Gazette is a small two-room space above the hardware store, with one ancient coffee maker, two desks, and a printer that jams if you do so much as look at it the wrong way. It had been a slow news week. Well... it’s always a slow news week.  
  
I had the radio on while I typed up a fluff piece about the upcoming church bake sale. That’s when I realized the radio had become much quieter.  
  
There was no ad break, no call-in segment. Just a song.  
  
Soft. Melancholic.  
  
A slow, almost hypnotic tune, playing on an endless loop.  
  
It had no lyrics. No instruments I could recognize. Just a voice, singing in a language that I didn’t recognize.  
  
I frowned and leaned closer, adjusting the dial. 97.3 Hollow Radio. It was still on our station’s frequency.  
  
That wasn’t supposed to be possible.  
  
I turned up the volume. The music didn’t waver like a normal station would when there was interference. It was clear as a bell, cutting through the static with unnatural clarity.  
  
By the time I got home, every radio in town was playing it.  
  
At first, people treated it like a joke.  
  
Kids at school dared each other to listen to it for as long as possible. One kid claimed he made it six hours straight before he got a headache. Another swore that if you listened long enough, the song started to change.  
  
It became a talking point at the diner, the bar, the town meetings.  
  
""I bet it’s some pirate radio station,"" Mrs. Calloway said at the bakery. She was giving out free pastries to anyone who listened to the signal for ten minutes.  
  
""I kinda like it,"" said old Frank, the town mechanic. He had it blasting from the auto shop while he worked. ""Makes time pass faster.""  
  
Not everyone was amused.  
  
""It’s damn creepy,"" the postmaster muttered, switching off the radio in the mailroom. ""Puts me on edge, like I’m waiting for something to happen.""  
  
The only thing people agreed on was that no one knew where it was coming from.  
  
The Hollow Radio station denied responsibility.  
  
""That’s not us,"" the station manager, Greg, told me over the phone. ""We tried cutting the transmission. Didn’t work. It’s like it’s... hijacking the frequency.""  
  
The FCC had no record of a new broadcast in our area. There were no towers nearby that could be transmitting it.  
  
Even the older folks, the ones who had lived in town their whole lives, swore they had never heard anything like it before.  
  
The strangest part was that it never stopped or paused.  
  
No station IDs, commercial breaks or silence.  
  
Just an unbroken repetition.  
  
I did what I always do when something unusual happens in town- I wrote about it.  
  
“Mysterious Signal Draws Attention in Elliot’s Hollow.”  
  
A harmless story to start the week. A quirky mystery for the townsfolk to talk about. I treated it like a fun little phenomenon, just another oddity in a town full of them.  
  
I didn’t know it yet, but I wasn’t just documenting a local mystery.

\-

I didn’t expect the signal to linger in people’s minds.  
  
Most stories I wrote had a 24-hour lifespan at best- one town council vote, one school fundraiser, one half-hearted debate about whether the general store should stop carrying plastic bags. The Hollow Gazette wasn’t exactly groundbreaking journalism.  
  
But the signal stuck.  
  
People kept talking about it. Not just in passing, not just as a joke, but as if it was affecting them personally.  
  
That was when I decided to write a follow-up.  
  
I thought maybe I’d find someone who tracked down its source. My theories were- a ham radio guy, or a bored teenager with too much time on their hands.  
  
Instead, I found something else.  
  
It started with Mrs. Calloway.  
  
I was interviewing her in the bakery, she had been one of the first to turn the signal into a business gimmick.  
  
She was in the middle of a sentence when she hesitated.  
  
""You ever have a dream that feels... too real?"" she asked quietly.  
  
I raised an eyebrow. ""Like a lucid dream?""  
  
She shook her head, kneading dough between her fingers. ""No, like... more than that. Like it happened.""  
  
She told me she had dreamed about her husband, Alan.  
  
""He’s been gone for fifteen years,"" she murmured. ""But I saw him. He was sitting right here, clear as day.""  
  
I tried to keep my expression neutral. People dream of lost loved ones all the time. It wasn’t news.  
  
""But here’s the thing,"" she continued, rubbing at her arms like she was suddenly cold. ""My neighbor saw us talking.""  
  
I frowned. ""You mean in real life?""  
  
""No. In his dream.""  
  
She looked at me then, her eyes fierce and unwavering.  
  
""He told me the next morning, word for word what Alan and I talked about. He wasn’t even in the bakery. He was sitting on his porch, but he said he could see us through the window.""  
  
A prickle of unease ran down my spine.  
  
""Did he-"" I swallowed. ""Did he say anything else?""  
  
Mrs. Calloway hesitated. ""He said Alan... Alan looked at him. Like he knew he was watching.""  
  
I thought it was a one-off story. An old woman missing her husband. A neighbor with a good memory.  
  
Then I started hearing the same thing from other people.  
  
A man at the gas station, Mark Atwood, told me he had a dream about going fishing with his brother.  
  
Nothing strange about that, except his brother told me he remembered watching himself fish from the shore.  
  
""I wanted to say something,"" the brother said, voice low, ""but I couldn’t move. It was like I was stuck. Just watching.""  
  
Neither of them realized the other had the same dream until I pointed it out.  
  
It didn’t stop there.  
  
A teenage girl told me she dreamed of being lost in the woods. Her best friend swore he had been in the dream with her.

  
A bar patron swore up and down he had a conversation with his wife in the dream, only to have her tell me she remembered the exact same details.

  
Different stories. Different experiences.  
  
But always the same people.  
  
And when I asked each of them a final question, the answer was always yes.  
  
""Did you listen to the signal before bed?""  
  
They all had.  
  
The hairs on the back of my neck wouldn’t settle. It wasn’t just a weird coincidence anymore. I tried to rationalize it, maybe it was suggestion. Maybe the whole town was just in their own heads, feeding off each other’s memories.  
  
But the details were too precise.  
  
Like they weren’t dreaming at all, instead it seemed like they were taken somewhere else, together. 

\-

The novelty was lost when the schoolteacher forgot her own name.  
  
Elliot’s Hollow was the kind of town where everybody knew everybody. There were only twelve teachers at the school, and Miss Carter had been teaching first grade for twenty years. She’d taught half the town’s kids how to read, and yet-  
  
That morning, she didn’t remember who she was.  
  
I was grabbing coffee from the diner when I heard the commotion. A few of the parents were murmuring near the counter, voices hushed, eyes darting toward the school. I caught Mark Atwood, the guy from the gas station, and asked what happened.  
  
""Miss Carter showed up late,"" he said. ""Just stood outside the building like she didn’t know where she was.""  
  
I frowned. ""She sick?""  
  
Mark frowned. He looked pale.  
  
""She didn’t know her own name.""  
  
That stopped me cold.  
  
""What do you mean?""  
  
""I mean she didn’t remember."" He let out a shaky breath, shifting uneasily. ""She kept saying she was... someone else.""  
  
A beat of silence passed between us.  
  
It wasn’t just Miss Carter.  
  
Down at the general store, Henry Weaver was refusing to open the register.  
  
He had been working the counter for as long as I could remember. No one else ran the store. He knew every supplier, every stock order.  
  
But today, he stood behind the counter, hands flat against the wood, and shook his head.  
  
""I don’t know how,"" he said.  
  
His son, Matt, hovered near the door, looking frantic. ""Dad, it’s just the register. You taught me how to use it when I was twelve.""  
  
Henry wouldn’t budge. Because Henry wasn’t Henry anymore.  
  
""I’m not supposed to be here,"" he mumbled. ""I’m not, I don’t work here.""  
  
""But you do,"" Matt said.  
  
Henry turned to me then, as if just noticing I was standing there.  
  
""I’m the mayor,"" he whispered.  
  
The blood drained from my face.  
  
Henry wasn’t the mayor. He had never been the mayor. But I’d heard that phrase before.  
  
A few days ago, I spoke with the real mayor, John Hartley, about the signal, asking if the town had any old records of experimental radio tests. He told me he’d been having strange dreams.  
  
""In the dream,"" he said, ""I wasn’t myself. I was Henry Weaver.""  
  
I hadn’t thought much of it at the time. The whole town had been dreaming about each other. It had just been a weird little pattern I was trying to make sense of.  
  
But now, Henry thought he was John. And John was nowhere to be found.  
  
By evening, I was feeling sick.  
  
I went to the pharmacy, half-convinced I was coming down with something, when I heard crying from the back of the store. A woman was sobbing, barely able to form words.  
  
It was Alice Perdue.  
  
I knew Alice. She lived alone in a little yellow house near the edge of town. She had never been married. Never had kids.  
  
But that night, she sat on the pharmacy floor, shaking violently, whispering:  
  
""Where’s my son?""  
  
The clerk, Tina Beckett, looked helpless, kneeling beside her.  
  
""You don’t have a son,"" she said, her voice gentle.  
  
Alice jerked away from her touch.  
  
""I do,"" she spat. ""I do, I do, I know I do-"" She choked on the words. ""I remember him. I raised him. I tucked him in every night. I-...I know his name. I know his face.""  
  
Tina looked up at me, fear pooling in her eyes.  
  
Alice gripped my wrist. Her nails dug into my skin.  
  
""Where is he?"" she pleaded. ""Where did he go?""  
  
I had no answer.  
  
Because I was starting to believe her.  
  
I sat in my car outside the pharmacy long after the lights had gone dark inside, gripping the steering wheel so hard my knuckles ached.  
  
Alice's sobs still echoed in my head. The raw panic in her voice, the certainty, the absolute certainty, that she had a son, even though no one in town had ever known her to have one.  
  
I couldn't shake it.  
  
Neither could I shake the look on Henry Weaver’s face when he told me he was the mayor. He hadn’t been confused, or delusional. He had been sure. He had been as sure as I was that I was Daniel Langley, local reporter, a guy who spent his time writing about farmer’s markets and high school football games.  
  
But what if I woke up tomorrow and found myself believing I was someone else?  
  
The thought made my stomach churn.  
  
This town was my home. I’d spent years covering its stories. I knew every back road, every face, every corner of this place that most people had forgotten even existed.  
  
And now, it was falling apart.  
  
People weren’t just forgetting things, they were becoming something else. And no one outside of town was going to care.  
  
We didn’t have big-city news outlets knocking at our doors. There were no government officials rolling in to investigate. If something was happening to us, we were on our own.  
  
The thought terrified me. But it also hardened something inside me.  
  
I had to know.  
  
It wasn’t about a story anymore. It wasn’t about getting the next edition of the Gazette printed on time.  
  
This was my town. These were my people. And if something was taking them, twisting them, stealing their identities, then I couldn’t just sit back and report on it like some passive observer.  
  
I needed to understand. I needed to see the dream for myself.  
  
I took a slow, steady breath, turned the dial on my radio, and let the signal take me.

\-

I don’t remember falling asleep.  
  
I remember static, low and endless, stretching in the back of my mind like the distant hum of power lines. I remember the feeling of drifting, like my body wasn’t my own anymore.  
  
Then I was somewhere else.  
  
I was standing in Elliot’s Hollow.  
  
But it wasn’t Elliot’s Hollow.  
  
The streets stretched endlessly, warping into impossible distances. Buildings flickered, like they were struggling to decide what they were supposed to be. Some houses looked years older than they should have been, their wooden planks sagging with rot. Others looked too new, pristine, like they had just been built yesterday.  
  
The air smelled thick and electric.  
  
And the people-  
  
They weren’t right.  
  
I turned, my breath hitching. The townsfolk were here. But they weren’t normal.  
  
Some were half-formed, their bodies flickering like a weak TV signal, snapping between ages, heights, even genders.  
  
Miss Carter, the schoolteacher, stood on the sidewalk, but her face was blurred. She shifted between being herself, and someone else entirely.  
  
Henry Weaver, the store clerk who thought he was the mayor, stood motionless, staring at the sky. His mouth opened and closed, over and over, like a puppet waiting for the right words to be placed inside him.  
  
And then there were the others.  
  
The ones who had stayed in the dream too long. They hadn’t just merged memories. They had merged completely.  
  
I saw a mother cradling an infant in her arms, rocking it slowly. I stepped closer, and nearly screamed.  
  
The child’s face was her own.  
  
A smaller, stretched version of it, pressed against her shoulder, mouthing silent words in unison. Their limbs fused together in places, the skin stitching them into a single, writhing shape.  
  
They turned to look at me at the same time. Two sets of identical eyes. Two mouths whispering the same words.  
  
""We are one. We are one. We are one.""  
  
Some had grown too large.  
  
I saw a man that wasn’t a man at all anymore, but a mass of bodies, tangled and shifting, they couldn’t decide which one was supposed to be in control.  
  
Faces bubbled beneath his skin, rising up like something pressing against the surface of water. A hand burst from his chest, flexing its fingers before sinking back inside.  
  
He turned, his three mouths speaking in unison.  
  
""Daniel.""  
  
I ran.  
  
I didn’t make it far before a hand grabbed my wrist.  
  
I jerked away, my breath ragged, but the grip was steady, human, real.  
  
Abel Cooper. The old blind man.  
  
But even he wasn’t untouched.  
  
There was a shadow of another face behind his own, flickering in and out of existence like a second exposure in a photograph. It whispered along with his voice, just a split second behind.  
  
""You shouldn’t be here, boy,"" he murmured.  
  
I swallowed back bile. ""What the hell is this place?""  
  
Abel’s lips tightened. He turned his head slightly, listening.  
  
""You’re still awake,"" he muttered. ""Not like the rest of them. But that won’t last long.""  
  
I shuddered. ""Why? What’s happening to them?""  
  
Abel exhaled slowly. His grip tightened.  
  
""Every time we dream, we lose a little more of ourselves,"" he said softly.  
  
He nodded toward the twisting figures, the mouths that didn’t stop whispering.  
  
""The ones who stay too long forget they were ever awake.""  
  
The horror sank into my bones. This wasn’t just a dream.  
  
A slow, careful dismantling of who they had been, breaking them down into something else.  
  
And I was standing in the middle of it.  
  
Abel turned back to me, and for the first time, I saw fear in his face.  
  
""You need to wake up.""

\-

I spent the next day digging through every record I could find.  
  
Something inside me had shifted. People were disappearing. Or worse, they were dissolving into something else.  
  
Even when I brought up names that should’ve been familiar, people I knew had lived here, worked here, had lives here, I was met with blank stares.  
  
I knew I didn’t have much time. The next person to be erased could be me.  
  
So I did the only thing that made sense.  
  
I went looking for the source.  
  
The first step was figuring out where the transmission was coming from.  
  
Elliot’s Hollow had one radio station, 97.3 Hollow Radio, and I already knew it wasn’t them. That meant there had to be another broadcast tower somewhere nearby.  
  
I needed help.  
  
I drove out to the edge of town, where I knew I’d find Ben Howarth, the closest thing this town had to a tech guy. He ran the only electronics repair shop in the Hollow, though mostly he just fixed old radios and shortwave equipment.  
  
When I told him what I was looking for, he frowned.  
  
""There’s no other broadcast tower in range,"" he said, rubbing his chin. ""Not one that’s supposed to be here, anyway.""  
  
""But if there was?"" I pressed.  
  
Ben sighed and pulled a yellowed map from a drawer, spreading it across his workbench. He ran his finger over the terrain, stopping near the northern woods.  
  
""Only place a rogue signal like that could be coming from is the old relay station.""  
  
I stiffened. ""Relay station?""  
  
Ben nodded. ""It was set up back in the sixties. Some government project, no one really knew what for. They abandoned it decades ago.""  
  
""Why?"" I asked.  
  
Ben shrugged. ""No idea. One day it was active, the next it wasn’t. Figured they shut it down for good."" He glanced up at me. ""But if someone turned it back on... that’s where you’d want to start looking.""  
  
The northern woods weren’t somewhere people went willingly. The trees were thick, the paths overgrown, and even in the daylight, the place had an unnatural stillness.  
  
I followed an old service road, half-buried under dead leaves.  
  
Then, through the trees, I saw it.  
  
A rusted chain-link fence, bent in places, barely holding together. Beyond it- a squat, concrete structure, half-buried in the hillside, its exterior streaked with decades of rain and moss.  
  
The relay station.  
  
A faded government emblem was still visible on the front. But the door was open.  
  
Inside, the air was thick with dust. The place had been gutted long ago, desks overturned, papers scattered across the floor. Rusted cabinets lined the walls, some still filled with yellowed folders, water-damaged notebooks.  
  
I picked one up, flipping through its pages.  
  
It was just technical jargon, broadcast frequencies, signal strength measurements. Then- something stranger.  
  
I skimmed through a section labeled Phase One: Theoretical Applications.  
  
My stomach clenched as I read.  
  
""If successful, the test will confirm cross-subjective connectivity between individuals. A shared cognitive framework. The beginning of true unity.""  
  
""Sustained exposure should result in memory cohesion across multiple subjects, leading to eventual total synthesis of identities.""  
  
A lump formed in my throat.  
  
This whole thing was some sort of sick test.  
  
And the people of Elliot’s Hollow had been the test subjects.  
  
I flipped ahead, scanning the later pages.  
  
Then my breath caught.  
  
There was a projected start date, but set all the way back in the 70's. However there were no reports of anything like this before, even from the folks who lived through that era. Something had stopped it back then, whether it was the researchers having a change of heart, or the project being shut down.  
  
But now, someone else had started it again.  
  
I forced myself to move. I followed the tangled mess of old cables, stepping over broken equipment, until I reached the back room.  
  
And there it was. The transmitter.  
  
A tower of rusted metal and ancient dials, still active, still humming. A signal relay looping the same song endlessly. It was still broadcasting.  
  
I clenched my jaw and moved toward the controls. The dials were unmarked, the labels peeled away, but I found what I was looking for, the switch.  
  
A simple power switch.  
  
My hands were shaking. If I turned this off... would it stop? Would the town go back to normal? Or had the damage already been done?  
  
I didn’t know.  
  
But I didn’t have a choice.  
  
I reached out- And flipped the switch.  
  
The signal cut off. The song stopped.  
  
The air around me felt violently empty.  
  
I thought I had fixed everything.

The town should have been silent. The relay station was off. The signal shouldn’t have been playing anymore. But as I stepped out of my car in the middle of Main Street, I heard it.  
  
A soft, distant melody. Faint, but still there.  
  
Still looping. Still inside them.  
  
At first glance, Elliot’s Hollow looked the same as always. The diner was open, people walked along the sidewalks, the low murmur of conversation drifting between them.  
  
But then I listened closer.  
  
Two men stood outside the gas station, talking. Their voices overlapped.  
  
Not like an echo, like a single voice split between two mouths, speaking in perfect unison.  
  
They paused at the same time. They blinked at the same time.  
  
Then one of them said something the other hadn’t. The conversation stumbled, fractured.  
  
For a moment, they both looked confused. Like they weren’t sure which one of them had been the one to speak.  
  
Then, just as quickly, they shook it off. Laughed. Kept talking. Like nothing was wrong.

  
Inside the diner, I saw a teenage girl sitting alone in a booth, staring at the table.  
  
I recognized her, Anna Halloway.  
  
But when I said her name, she didn’t look up.  
  
""It’s not right,"" she murmured.  
  
I took a slow step forward. ""What isn’t?""  
  
She swallowed hard. ""I don’t remember my own name.""  
  
""But I remember being Mr. Grant,"" she said, her voice hollow.  
  
I stiffened.  
  
""Grant?"" I echoed.  
  
She nodded, blinking rapidly, like she was trying to reset herself.  
  
""I was a butcher, owned the shop on Maple. I remember standing behind the counter. I remember sharpening knives... cutting meat."" Her hands curled into fists on the table. ""But I’m not him. I know I’m not him. So why do I remember everything about his life?""  
  
I didn’t have an answer. Because I had seen Mr. Grant just last week. He had been in his shop, wiping down the counters, chatting about an upcoming storm.  
  
But now, Anna was remembering his life like it was hers. And I had no idea where he was.  
  
The bartender at O’Malley’s was wiping down the counter when I walked in. I had met him a dozen times before, his name was Trevor.  
  
But when I greeted him, he smiled and said:  
  
""I’m Mr. Calloway.""  
  
I felt ice crawl up my spine.  
  
Mr. Calloway had died five years ago.  
  
I backed out of the bar without another word.  
  
Across the street, an old woman sat on a bench, rocking back and forth. She was crying.  
  
I approached slowly, keeping my voice calm. ""Ma’am? Are you alright?""  
  
She looked up at me with too many emotions at once.  
  
""I remember being a child,"" she whispered.  
  
I swallowed.  
  
""I remember running through the orchard. I remember my father lifting me onto his shoulders, telling me to pick the ripest apples. I remember the smell of my mother’s cooking.""  
  
She clutched the front of her shirt with trembling fingers.  
  
""But I don’t remember my own life,"" she whimpered.  
  
A sharp wind blew through the street, and she closed her eyes, letting it pass over her like a tide.  
  
When she opened them again, she was calm. She sat up a little straighter.  
  
""I remember being Abel Cooper,"" she said.  
  
And just like that, her voice had changed.  
  
Deeper. More certain.  
  
""Abel’s gone,"" she murmured. ""But I still remember him.""  
  
I stepped back, my chest tightening.  
  
The ones who listened the longest, the ones who had been playing the signal on repeat, they weren’t just merging memories.  
  
They were becoming part of each other. They were pieces of the same whole. And they didn’t even realize it.  
  
I drove to town hall, hoping, praying, that maybe someone had noticed. That maybe I would find an emergency team, government officials, anyone.  
  
But when I stepped through the doors- the building was empty.  
  
No records. No case files. No sign that anyone had ever tried to intervene.  
  
I dug through the offices, my breath quickening. There had to be something. But the cabinets were bare. The desks were hollow. The records were gone.  
  
This town had been left alone.  
  
Whoever had started this never intended to undo it. And no one was coming to save us.

\-

I didn’t want to go back. Everything in my body screamed not to.  
  
But as I stood outside the relay station, staring at its rotting, moss-covered shell, I knew I didn’t have a choice.  
  
The town was already lost.  
  
I had to understand why.  
  
The papers were still scattered across the floor, just as I had left them. I crouched down, running my hands over them, flipping through their brittle pages. The words meant nothing now. I had already read them.  
  
But then, as I pushed aside a thick stack near the control console, I saw it.  
  
A seam in the floor. A sliver of metal, just barely exposed beneath the weight of discarded documents.  
  
I brushed the rest away, revealing a hatch, rusted at the edges, its handle cold beneath my fingers.  
  
There were no markings. No labels. No signs of what was beneath.  
  
I hesitated. The thought of going deeper made my stomach twist. But I had come this far.  
  
I turned the handle. It groaned, metal protesting against years of disuse.  
  
Then, with a slow, reluctant creak, the hatch opened.



The air inside was different. Not stale like the rest of the station.  
  
A ladder led down into darkness. The rungs were cold and damp, and as I descended, the only sound was my own breath, shallow and unsteady.  
  
The space beneath the station was smaller than I expected.  
  
Low concrete walls. Exposed wiring. And at the far end, sitting on a steel desk, glowing faintly in the dim light-  
  
A terminal.  
  
It was still on.

I took a slow step forward.  
  
The screen was dark at first. Then, as if sensing me, a blinking cursor appeared.  
  
Lines of text rolled out, slow and deliberate.  
  
""Are you the next?""  
  
My throat tightened.  
  
I didn’t want to answer. But my hands moved on their own.  
  
""Who are you?""  
  
A long pause. Then, words materialized, one by one.  
  
""We were the first.""  
  
The words hit me in the chest. I typed again.  
  
""First what?""  
  
The screen flickered. More words.  
  
""First to merge. First to evolve.""  
  
I felt the cold metal of the desk beneath my fingers. I already knew what it was saying. I just needed to hear it.  
  
""What happened to the researchers?""  
  
This time, there was no hesitation.  
  
""We became something greater.""

A sickening realization crawled through me. The station had never been abandoned.  
  
The people who worked here, the scientists, the researchers, the ones who had started this, they were still here.  
  
Not in body. They had become this. This collective intelligence pulsing through the terminal, waiting, watching.  
  
And now, they were speaking to me.

I forced myself to type again.  
  
""What is this experiment?""  
  
The response was instant.  
  
""A gift.""  
  
I clenched my jaw.  
  
""What was the goal?""  
  
A brief pause.  
  
Then, a single word.  
  
""Ascension.""  
  
My fingers hovered over the keys.  
  
They weren’t just answering me. They were studying me. Their words felt genuine to a fault. Like they were guiding me to an understanding, leading me toward something inevitable.  
  
I pressed forward.  
  
""Why the town? Why these people?""  
  
The screen flickered.  
  
""The process must be gradual. Humanity fears the unknown. If they were taken all at once, they would resist. But introduced in phases... they welcome it.""  
  
I felt sick.  
  
They hadn’t forced this on Elliot’s Hollow. They had eased them into it. Through the radio. Through the dream.  
  
Until the town had willingly let go of their individuality.  
  
And now they were gone.

The terminal pulsed again.  
  
""This is what we were meant to become.""  
  
I typed furiously.  
  
""You’re killing them.""  
  
For the first time, the cursor blinked for longer than before.  
  
Then, the words on the screen changed.  
  
""I was Emily Holloway.""  
  
My breath caught in my throat.  
  
Another line. Another name.  
  
""I was Sheriff Anders.""  
  
More messages. More voices.  
  
""I was Trevor.""  
""I was Anna.""  
""I was Mr. Calloway.""  
  
Each one typed in perfect sequence.  
  
The people I had seen in town. The ones who had forgotten themselves. The ones who had already merged.  
  
And in that moment, I understood. It was accelerating.  
  
A chill ran through me. I knew what they meant.  
  
My hands shook as I typed my final question.  
  
""How do I stop it?""  
  
No hesitation.  
  
""You don't.""  
  
Anger and frustration took over. I picked up a discarded pipe from the floor, and wailed on the machine.  
  
The screen flickered, on the brink of finally breaking.  
  
Then, when the screen blinked back to life. A single phrase flickered across the almost dead monitor.  
  
""It is too late.""  


The screen finally died with one last hit. The relay station hummed beneath my feet.  
  
I ran.

I escaped back to my car, but there was nothing left for me in the town. I feared what I would walk into if I went back.

I drove. As fast as I could, as far as I could, the headlights of my car tearing through the black night.  
  
The town vanished in my rearview mirror. But I hadn’t saved them. I had only witnessed the inevitable.  
  
And when I finally reached the next town over, when I finally thought I was safe-  
  
I heard it.  
  
Through the open doors of a small roadside diner. A familiar song, playing softly from the old radio.  
  
Inside, people were talking. Laughing. Intrigued by this strange new station that just popped up.  
  
And occasionally, their voices overlapped.  
  
Perfectly.  
  
As if they were speaking as one.

I’m proposing to my partner during our vacation to Oahu in October. We are staying at Disney Aulani and are renting a car for our trip. I would like some feedback on my itinerary I’m planning! We have a kitchen at the resort and I’m contemplating cooking at home for some meals to save money but also want to be able to try all the new foods around me. 

Day 1- Arrive around 11:30 AM and grab rental car. Drive to the Dole Plantation and walk around. Grab Leonard’s Malasada’s. Grab some groceries at Costco and head to the resort to relax for the evening. Watch the sunset at paradise cove and dinner at Monkeypod by Merriman. 

Day 2- Koko Crater sunrise hike then head to Frankie’s tropical fruit stand. Then snorkeling at Lanikai and Kailua beach/ kayak to the Mokes. Drive through the Botanical Gardens and then have dinner at Haleiwa Joe’s Haiku Gardens. 

Day 3- climb works 3 hours Zipline then spending time in Haleiwa. Here we will visit Waimea Falls, Laniakea Beach, Sharks Cove, and then watch the sunset at Sunset Beach park. Unsure on dinner plans. 

Day 4-Kualoa Ranch e-bike tour or UTV private tour (I haven’t decided which one yet). Then head to the Polynesian Cultural Center and then check out Kāne‘ohe Bay and have dinner at House Without a Key. 

Day 5- Spa day! Staying close at Laniwai Spa and checking out the Ko Olina Marina and beaches. Maybe hangout at the lazy river and see mermaids cove. Dinner at Hau Tree. 

Day 6- ‘Aiea Loop trailhead for a sunrise hike. Then head to the Aloha Stadium Swap Meet and the Kaka’ako farmers market. Also maybe stop at rainbow drive in. Also thinking of getting a tattoo this day. 

Day 7-Diamond head crater trail and Leonard’s bakery one more time. We fly out around 10:30 AM. 

If this too much planned or not enough? Is there anything anyone would add? I’ve heard Luao’s can be overpriced and that the food isn’t really worth it.. I kinda wanted to do a sunset cruise dinner but I think I picked good dinner spots to replace the sunset cruise.  

For food spots I have-
Musubi cafe Iyasume,
Marugame Udon,
Zippys Makikiki,
Sunrise shack,
Lin’s Hawaiian Snacks,
Helena’s Hawaiian food,
The pig and the lady,
Aloha table Waikiki,
Matsumoto shaved ice cream,
Aunty Sandy’s Banana Bread, and
Kona Coffee Proveyors

Of the food places would you remove anything?

I currently need 9 hours of rest to feel fully rested and take 3 hour naps every day,"Just to share some health records.. My depression & anxiety is currently managed with Wellbutrin and Sertraline. Setraline does make me groggy, so I take it around 10pm. I have low vitamin D, and have started supplements for that which seem to have helped. I have some teeth grinding issues that seem to get better since starting magnesium. Currently at a healthy but low BMI. These adjustments seem to help slightly, but I still sleep so much. I basically feel like I need 9 hours of sleep to function without napping, and I usually nap after work every single day for about 3 hours. On my days off, I sleep in. I'm constantly tired and drinking coffee throughout the day to stay alert. I'm getting bloodwork done on my thyroid and other vitamin levels to figure out if there's any underlying issue.

I know I am not active enough, I live a pretty sedentary life. I love running, but only run during the warmer seasons and that seems to be the times I'm most active. (Though after running, I ususally take a nap lol)

I am leaning towards this just becoming a bad habit of mine, and I'm giving into the sleepiness. When I feel it coming on it feels impossible to stay awake, but starting next week I want to change drastically. I want to start waking up at 7am every day next week, and to avoid naps altogether. I'm sick of feeling like I'm wasting my years away sleeping and napping and I want to be more disciplined and stick to schedules and routine rather than just giving in every time I'm sleepy. I'm sick of feeling like there isn't enough hours in the day to get anything done, which in turn makes me feel anxious and depressed. It's a vicious cycle I'm in.

Has anyone successfully made this kind of change? What worked for you? I'd especially love to hear from others dealing with depression/anxiety who've managed to fix their sleep schedules. Thank you",1,1740165611.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

No matter how much I slept, I woke up feeling drained. I tried everything—energy drinks, coffee, and even expensive supplements—but nothing seemed to work. That’s when I stumbled upon Mitolyn and decided to give it a shot. After reading multiple Mitolyn reviews, I was hopeful but skeptical. Could this be the solution I had been looking for?

My Experience with Mitolyn

When my bottle of Mitolyn arrived, I started taking it as directed. Within the first few days, I noticed a slight increase in my energy levels. I wasn’t crashing in the middle of the day like I used to. By the end of the second week, the changes were undeniable.



Increased Energy Levels – I felt more awake and alert throughout the day without relying on caffeine.



Improved Mental Clarity – Brain fog, which had plagued me for years, began to lift. My focus and productivity improved significantly.



Better Sleep Quality – Surprisingly, my sleep became more restful, and I woke up feeling refreshed.



Overall Well-being – I felt healthier, more active, and motivated to take on daily challenges.



Why Mitolyn Stands Out

Reading through various Mitolyn reviews, I realized that I wasn’t alone in experiencing these positive changes. Many users reported similar results, which made me even more confident in its effectiveness. Unlike other energy-boosting supplements, Mitolyn works at the mitochondrial level, supporting natural energy production rather than providing a temporary boost. This makes it a game-changer for people dealing with chronic fatigue and low energy.



The Science Behind Mitolyn

One of the things that impressed me the most about Mitolyn is the science behind it. Many energy supplements rely on caffeine or other stimulants to create a short-term boost in energy. While this can be effective for a few hours, it often leads to crashes and dependency. Mitolyn, on the other hand, focuses on enhancing mitochondrial function. Mitochondria are often called the powerhouse of the cell because they generate the energy needed for cellular functions. When mitochondrial function declines, so does overall energy production.



Mitolyn contains ingredients that support and optimize mitochondrial efficiency, helping the body produce sustained energy throughout the day. This explains why so many people experience long-term benefits rather than just a quick boost.

My Journey After One Month

After using Mitolyn consistently for a month, I noticed even greater improvements in my overall well-being. My energy levels continued to rise, and I felt more resilient against daily stress. Here’s a breakdown of how my life changed:



Week 1: Small but noticeable improvements in energy levels. No major changes but a slight reduction in mid-day crashes.



Week 2: Brain fog lifted significantly. I could concentrate better at work and complete tasks more efficiently.



Week 3: My sleep improved drastically. I woke up feeling refreshed rather than groggy.



Week 4: My motivation and physical stamina increased. I even started exercising more regularly, something I had struggled with before.



Comparing Mitolyn to Other Supplements

Before discovering Mitolyn, I had tried numerous other supplements, including vitamin B12, iron, and generic energy boosters. While some of these provided temporary relief, none offered the long-term benefits I experienced with Mitolyn. Many Mitolyn reviews mention similar experiences, where other products fail to deliver consistent results.



A key reason Mitolyn stands out is its holistic approach. Instead of merely masking symptoms, it addresses the root cause of fatigue by optimizing cellular energy production. This makes it a superior choice for anyone looking for a natural and sustainable energy solution.



The Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Like any supplement, Mitolyn has its pros and cons. While my experience has been overwhelmingly positive, I believe in providing a balanced review.



Pros:

Natural Energy Boost: Unlike caffeine, it doesn’t cause jitters or crashes.



Supports Mitochondrial Health: Works at the cellular level for long-term benefits.



Improves Focus and Mental Clarity: Enhances cognitive function and reduces brain fog.



Better Sleep Quality: Many users, including myself, reported improved sleep patterns.



No Harmful Stimulants: Safe for daily use without dependency concerns.



Cons:

Results Take Time: Unlike stimulants that provide an immediate effect, Mitolyn requires consistent use for noticeable improvements.



Cost: Some may find it pricier than standard energy supplements, though the benefits justify the price.



Who Should Try Mitolyn?

Based on my experience and countless Mitolyn reviews, I would recommend this supplement to:



Individuals suffering from chronic fatigue or low energy levels.



People dealing with brain fog and reduced cognitive function.



Anyone looking for a natural and long-term solution for better overall health.



Those who want to improve their sleep quality and wake up feeling refreshed.



How to Get the Best Results with Mitolyn

If you’re considering trying Mitolyn, here are a few tips to maximize its effectiveness:



Take It Consistently: Results build over time, so be patient and stick to the recommended dosage.



Maintain a Healthy Diet: Nutrient-rich foods can enhance the effects of Mitolyn.



Stay Hydrated: Proper hydration supports mitochondrial function and overall health.



Get Enough Sleep: While Mitolyn helps with energy, quality sleep is essential for optimal benefits.



Exercise Regularly: Physical activity can complement the supplement’s energy-boosting effects.

Final Thoughts: Is Mitolyn Worth It?

After using Mitolyn consistently for a month, I can confidently say that this supplement has transformed my life. My energy levels are stable, my focus has sharpened, and I finally feel like myself again. If you’re struggling with fatigue, brain fog, or lack of motivation, I highly recommend giving Mitolyn a try.



Based on my experience and numerous Mitolyn reviews, this supplement is worth every penny. If you're on the fence, I suggest trying it for yourself—you might just experience the same life-changing benefits that I did!",1,1740165006.0,aliner,3,1.0,False
1iuyx8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1iuyx8o/need_advice_to_clear_my_head_am_i_too_harsh_on/,Need advice to clear my head. Am I too harsh on myself?,"We've been together for 3 years 27(M) me and 30(F) her, we had a happy relationship and we got along well.

During this time, I've always gave her enough attention, spent time with her, complimented her even though she didn't look her best at times, whenever she had to go somewhere I made sure to drive her and pick her up to make sure she is safe. She would even tell me sometimes how nicely I treated her and how a good boyfriend I was.

I would pay for almost all of our dates (meals,coffee,gas,parking fees etc.. etc.), groceries etc.. That's how she liked it because she is Eastern European. She would sometimes offer to pay for a desert here and there but %80 of the time I was paying for everything.

Until this summer, she started changing a little. She started flying back to her hometown more often, staying there for weeks sometimes months, started complaining about my income.( I make around 2-3k USD per month, she makes the same amount, it's higher than average in my country). She started saying that she sees no future because I am not capable of taking on the responsibility of a household(she means paying for everything from rent to bills, dates, holidays, her nails, hair etc..) I can afford all of that but there won't be much left to me after paying all those stuff. I won't be able to save any money.

She also said that I don't benefit her life anyhow, she said we are having a 50/50 paying relationship although I said ""I've been paying for 3 years for our dates what do you mean?"". She said food and coffee doesn't count, she is still paying the bills and rent of her apartment herself(She has a seperate apartment). And I am supposed to be paying for those things along with her other personal expenses she lists. I even told her that we can talk about those things she wants and find a solution but well, she didn't really give me a chance and did that thing you will see below.

I was searching for an extra income whole time but I couldn't secure it, even I want it myself, not only for her but it just didn't work out. She blamed me that I didn't try hard enough and I am comfortable with the money I make. I asked her to give me a bit more time and I will definitely make my income better and asked for her support, she was like I've been waiting for like 3 years nothing changed in your life.

(In these 3 years I've bought a car from scratch all paid in cash, and cars are extremely expensive in my country. I've bought a new phone, new laptop, had to pay for my military service which is 2-3k, we went on 5-6 plus holidays. I really didn't have a chance to breathe since I was starting my life fresh. Also I increased my income in my current job too.)

Then bam, a few weeks later she cheated on me. I found out that she met one guy and was talking to two others at the same time. We didn't see eachother for a month but then she started coming to my place again, we sometimes hang out and stuff but we are not in a relationship anymore.

She begged me to not cut our connection because she really values me and likes my company. I told her as long as she doesn't talk to anyone she can come and visit me but if she decides to talk to someone please don't contact me anymore. She said okay and she was happy with it.

And again, I caught her talking to multiple people ,she said she talks to them because she is bored and we are not in a relationship anymore so I cannot control her. She sees me less although when she is around me she is still happy and interested in me. It got to a stupid point.

I am just left with my feelings and I don't know what to do. I am blaming myself for not being able to increase my income and I really liked her company because she is cute and fun. I feel like I won't be able to find someone I'd be interested in anymore. I feel scared about my future. Normally I am not this type of person and If I saw myself like this 6 months ago I would probably slap myself and tell myself to man up but I don't know why I am feeling this way at the moment. I even started wanting her back.

I just wanted to pour my heart out here because I don't really want to tell this to people around me, if you guys have something to say to clear my mind or wake me up a little bit I am open to hear your thoughts.

1iuyubu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1iuyubu/i_am_tired_of_ai_hype/,I am tired of AI hype,"To me, LLMs are just nice to have. They are the furthest from necessary or life changing as they are so often claimed to be. To counter the common ""it can answer all of your questions on any subject"" point, we already had powerful search engines for a two decades. As long as you knew specifically what you are looking for you will find it with a search engine. Complete with context and feedback,  you knew where the information is coming from so you knew whether to trust it. Instead, an LLM will confidently spit out a verbose, mechanically polite, list of bullet points that I personally find very tedious to read. And I would be left doubting its accuracy.

I genuinely can't find a use for LLMs that materially improves my life. I already knew how to code and make my own snake games and websites. Maybe the wow factor of typing in ""make a snake game"" and seeing code being spit out was lost on me?

In my work as a data engineer LLMs are more than useless. Because the problems I face are almost never solved by looking at a single file of code. Frequently they are in completely different projects. And most of the time it is not possible to identify issues without debugging or running queries in a live environment that an LLM can't access and even an AI agent would find hard to navigate. So for me LLMs are restricted to doing chump boilerplate code, which I probably can do faster with a column editor, macros and snippets. Or a glorified search engine with inferior experience and questionable accuracy.

I also do not care about image, video or music generation. And never have I ever before gen AI ran out of internet content to consume. Never have I tried to search for a specific ""cat drinking coffee or girl in specific position with specific hair"" video or image. I just doom scroll for entertainment and I get the most enjoyment when I encounter something completely novel to me that I wouldn't have known how to ask gen ai for.

When I research subjects outside of my expertise like investing and managing money, I find being restricted to an LLM chat window and being confined to an ask first then get answers setting much less useful than picking up a carefully thought out book written by an expert or a video series from a good communicator with a syllabus that has been prepared diligently. I can't learn from an AI alone because I don't what to ask. An AI ""side teacher"" just distracts me by encouraging going into rabbit holes and running in circles around questions that it just takes me longer to read or consume my curated quality content. I have no prior knowledge of the quality of the material AI is going to teach me because my answers will be unique to me and no one in my position would have vetted it and reviewed it.

Now this is my experience. But I go on the internet and I find people swearing by LLMs and how they were able to increase their productivity x10 and how their lives have been transformed and I am just left wondering how? So I push back on this hype.

My position is an LLM is a tool that is useful in limited scenarios and overall it doesn't add values that were not possible before its existence. And most important of all, its capabilities are extremely hyped, its developers chose to scare people into using it instead of being left behind as a user acquisition strategy and it is morally dubious in its usage of training data and environmental impact. Not to mention our online experiences now have devolved into a game of ""dodge the low effort gen AI content"". If it was up to me I would choose a world without widely spread gen AI.",13,1740164791.0,ArtificialInteligence,40,0.59,False

Ever stumbled upon a hidden coastal gem that makes you want to keep it all to yourself? 
That&#8217;s exactly how I felt when I first set foot on Tsoutsouras Beach in Crete. 
This charming stretch of coastline, tucked away 63km south of Heraklion, is a delightful surprise for beach lovers and history buffs alike.
As I approached the beach, the first thing that caught my eye was the imposing Gorge of Mindris looming in the background. 




The beach itself stretches out in two long, sheltered bays spanning about 2km. 
The coarse sand feels great underfoot, and the crystal clear water is perfect for a refreshing dip.
What really sets Tsoutsouras apart is its rich history. 
Built on the site of the ancient city Inatos, it was once the port of Priansos.

As I walked along the shore, I couldn&#8217;t help but imagine the bustling activity that must have taken place here centuries ago.
One of the coolest things about Tsoutsouras is its reputation for therapeutic swimming.

The beach strikes a nice balance between being developed and maintaining a laid back vibe.

Overall, Tsoutsouras Beach offers a perfect blend of history, natural beauty, and relaxation.
Whether you&#8217;re a history enthusiast, a beach bum, or just someone looking to escape the crowds, this little slice of Cretan paradise is well worth a visit.

History and Significance
The history of Tsoutsouras Beach stretches back millennia, adding a fascinating layer of depth to this coastal gem. 
The beach and surrounding area occupy the site of the ancient city of Inatos, which served as the port for the inland city of Priansos.
One of the most significant historical features of the area is the cave of Eileithyia, located in the center of the village. 
Eileithyia was the Greek goddess of childbirth, and this cave served as a sanctuary dedicated to her worship for many centuries. 
Archaeologists have uncovered a wealth of offerings in the cave, including bronze and clay figurines, jewelry, and even Egyptian faience statuettes, highlighting the far reaching influence of this sacred site.
The name Tsoutsouras itself has historical roots, deriving from the Venetian word &#8216;Zuzzuro&#8217;. 
This linguistic legacy points to the area&#8217;s importance during the period of Venetian rule in Crete, which lasted from the 13th to the 17th century.
In more recent history, Tsoutsouras has been the subject of some intriguing stories and speculation. 
Some reports suggest that objects of advanced Minoan technology were discovered in the area and subsequently removed by the American military. 
While the veracity of these claims is debated, they add an air of mystery to the locale that many visitors find captivating.

While you can&#8217;t enter the cave itself due to ongoing archaeological work, even viewing it from the outside and imagining its significance thousands of years ago is a powerful experience.
Lastly, don&#8217;t forget about the simple pleasure of relaxation. 
Whether it&#8217;s reading a book under the shade of a tamarisk tree, sunbathing on the warm sand, or simply sitting and watching the waves, Tsoutsouras Beach provides the perfect backdrop for unwinding and recharging.

Meet Genial, the French startup that recently pocketed a cool $1.9 million to craft AI agents designed to shake up the leisure and tourism sectors. And it's not just about booking your next trip to Paris—it’s about evolving the very fabric of customer service and sales in this vibrant industry.

**The Tourism Tipping Point**

Genial isn’t just swimming with the tide—they're crafting the wave. Nearly half of their clientele is knee-deep in the tourism sector, a domain ripe for transformation by AI. With the cash infusion led by Huttopia and Crédit Agricole, Genial aims to scale up their offerings, doubling their employee count and expanding their global reach.

Their AI agents don’t just sit around learning your coffee preferences either. These digital dynamos are built to tackle sales, marketing, and customer relationships, essentially offering businesses a Swiss Army knife of AI capabilities. The idea is to create frictionless interactions in the tourism space, where AI ensures you’re not just another traveler lost in translation.

**A Tale of Two Startups**

Interestingly, the world of AI does not just end in solving business needs. In another corner of the tech universe, companies like Booking Holdings are flipping open their playbooks, fully embracing generative AI as a game-changer. From personal travel agendas tailored just for you to whittling away at cumbersome travel logistics, AI promises seamless journeys—redefining ‘Bon Voyage’ with a digital spin.

**AI: Liberator or Job Terminator?**

While startups like Genial are heralding a golden age of technological ease, you can’t help but wonder: Is this AI as liberator or AI as job terminator? Consider the human workforce—will AI replace humans or simply drive new kinds of jobs that we can't even imagine yet?

- Startups target India1 early because they're willing to pay premium prices and their consumption habits drive broader market trends.

I like that a coffee table or chair can be jumped over instead of being a brick wall like in KF2. I like the new boss fights, especially because they mesh well with the dodge ability (although you can so effortlessly dance around enemies, it really feels like it should be a class ability for the Ninja). I like some of the new enemy designs, like the Siren extending its neck, the Husk hovering over the ground and the Crawlers actually crawling on walls.

It's just all for nothing because KF3 abandons most of the design choices that made KF2 great. Namely:

* In KF2 all guns felt powerful. They all had great animations and sounds, and they could all oneshot clot heads so you never felt like you're holding a peashooter. No longer the case.

* In KF2 enemy movement was predictable. Enemies either always kept their head in the same spot or moved it around as part of an often repeated, easy to memorize animation (like the Slasher roll or the Fleshpound rage animation). This let you enter a sort of flow state where you pop one head after the other because you intuitively know where you will need to aim. No longer the case, enemies move extremely erratically and unpredictably at all times.

* In KF2 players were pretty immobile. The focus was on staying put and aiming properly. Fighting your way through a horde felt tense and scary because you're so slow and enemies could grab you, which could easily get you killed. Now with the slide, dodge and high movement speed, it feels like they're trying to turn it into some sort of pseudo movement shooter, but the focus on getting headshots and conserving ammo just doesn't mesh well with that idea.

It feels to me as if the people who developed this game are the same who updated KF2 in its later years, and it was already clear then that they didn't understand the game and what made it good. I don't even think the game's biggest issue is how obviously undercooked it is or how boring the setting and characters are, it's that it takes a completely different design direction that just doesn't work for this franchise at all in my opinion. I don't think this game will succeed. I wish that they hadn't enshittified KF2 before making KF3.",8,1740163706.0,killingfloor,0,0.79,False

Most customers are searching online for products and services, so you need to ensure your business is showing up at the top of the results.

As a digital marketing agency that specializes in helping local businesses get found and chosen by customers online, we want to share some of our top tips to boost your Local SEO and dominate the search results in your area:

**Google Business Profile (GBP) is Your Best Friend** – If you haven’t claimed and optimized your GBP, do it now! Fill in your NAP, add quality photos, and keep your hours updated. Google incentivizes active profiles.

**Ask for Reviews** – Reviews pull duty by enhancing your credibility and your local ranking. Encourage happy customers to leave a quick review (and always respond to them).

**Local Keywords Matter** – Use phrases like **""**Best coffee shop in \[your city\]"" instead of just “best coffee shop” in both your website copy and on your GBP.

**Consistency is Key** – Your business name, address, and phone number (NAP) should be consistent across all listings (Google, Yelp, Facebook, etc.). Conflicting info confuses search engines.

**Location Pages & Local Content** – If you have multiple locations, create separate location-specific pages on your website. Also, post content that speaks to your community (local events, news, etc.)

**Backlinks from Local Sources** – Get listed in local directories, collaborate with local businesses, and get featured on local news sites/blogs. Google and customers value these local connections.

1iuyd2h,https://i.redd.it/as5gjc7vfjke1.jpeg,Check out this amazing Canadian Veterans Group,"Here’s a proudly Canadian Veteran group called:

“Veterans UN-Nato Canada Group""

This group was founded in 2008 by Denis ” Ryfell ” Beaudin in Quebec and the group quickly grew from there and expended internationally. They are the 2nd largest veterans’ group in Canada after the legion. With over 72 regions in the Country. Lots of folks perceive the group as a “motocycle Club” when in fact the group is not a motorcycle club and the group does not affiliated with any of them. However, 70-80% of members do own a motorcycle and do enjoy the sport of it and they do like to organize rides for the group where folks can join the ride with there own cars (four wheels) as well. The regional groups meet often for breakfast, coffee, supper, lunch or social like party, dance, bowling, motorcycle rides, and special event such as Christmas parties. The group also attends important ceremonies like Remembrance Day. Your also allowed to bring in your wife, husband and kids to event and meeting because they are also part of the big family.

The group is all about bringing Canadian Armed Forces Veterans out of isolation to give them a new taste for life, make new friends, to create a healthy, trustworthy environment, comradeship, to support each other and to have fun. The group as many regions across Canada, USA, Germany, France, and Philippines.

Its more then just a group it’s a family of brothers and sister and many of them actively volunteers in the veteran’s community. The group is actively involved in the veteran’s community and even as a position in the Veterans Affairs Policy Advisory committee. The group also helps active or retired military members, by offering support and advice when needed. With regular activities, the group stays in contact with its members and gains trust so we may “NEVER FORGET WHO WE ARE”. The group is always there to help and assist the brotherhood and sisterhood when needed. There’re also many members within the group that provides assistance to veterans in navigating VAC and filling applications with them and to help them get the help they need from VAC or the veterans community. One of the main purposes of the group is to make new friendship and rekindle old ones.

The group mission is as follows:

Our mission is to bring our brothers and sisters in arms that have served with the Canadian Armed Forces, out from isolation in which they have put themselves in, to give them a new taste for life, and to create a healthy, trustworthy environment. Being united by our common experiences, we collectively want to save lives.

This mission can only be achieved by gathering the members of Veterans UN-NATO Canada by means of meetings and activities. 
The purpose is to make new friendship and rekindle old ones.

There is no membership cards and no annual fee. This group was created so members could find old friends, stay in touch and share but mostly to ensure that we never forget our fellow brothers and sisters in arms who have either been wounded or have fallen in combat during a mission. “The only cost involved is the cost of the groups crest to get patch in”.

I've lived in LA for 13 years, my husband for 25. I've only ever lived on the Westside of LA... I really love it (despite some of its challenges) and ideally would like to stay but we want more space, a slower pace of life, we're a little nervous how the re-building of the Palisades will further impact traffic on this side of town, etc etc.

Our budget goes a lot further in Westlake than SM/BW (small condo living in SM/BW vs large town or single family home in WL). I'm drawn to Westlake because I've heard it's a great place to live, charming, etc. But I'd love to hear your thoughts and if you think it could be a good fit for what we're looking for and what we value.

Things that are important to us: walkability (coffee shops, schools, etc), strong community, inclusive feeling over exclusive, diversity (realizing Westlake might lack this), people from all over, not just people born/raised in LA, access to nature.

You'll have to grab the one-time ‘Powerpack’ purchase and then it’ll then sync all your notes/edits to your iCloud Drive which you can then open as a vault or use something like Hazel to copy into your main vault. 

It writes proper front matter and tags too.

Right now it’s a ‘1.0’ and the sync is 1-way, we’ll be working on 2-way sync in the future.

Me (27 f) and my bf(28 m) are living together since 7 years now, both of us are pretty happy with where we are in life atm.

I'm almost done with Uni + parttime job, he got a job himself that he likes and together we earn enough money to live a bit carefree. There is just one thing

I do ALL the housework:

Obviously i tried to talk to him about trying to help more several times.

He says the can't clean the cat litter because its disgusting, same thing when they throw up or got poop zoomies. Thats ok - some ppl cant do that.

cooking: well before starting Uni, i actually became a chef so i got something solid if i fail in uni - so he says i do it way better and he can't cook

cleaning up: he hates cleaning

coffee/tea/breakfast: as i'm flexible due to uni rarely starting early, so i time breakfast and a hot beverage fitting to his work-times

dishes: when i'm persistent enough, he helps

clothing: i do 95% of that  
and some other things related to daily tasks

So when i came home after a meeting around 12:30pm, he was hungry and i said ""Can't right now, need to do 1-2 things thesis related, will cook after that"" , his answer was ""oh so i can't eat right now?"". Well as i was a bit stressed out by the meeting and i just thought ""fuck it"" and went in the kitchen and started cooking. One of our cats didn't like the food i gave them the evening before and was a bit naughty, so she played a bit with the paintings on the wall in his room. So i could hear ""heeey, take care of this cat will you ? i'm working and can't right now!"" - so i did. While cooking, i did some housework on the side. A few days before that we replaced our wardrobe for a bigger one and put the smaller one that does not look like a wardrobe at all in the office for office things. He said his older clothes that dont fit anymore need to be washed before being placed in the new wardrobe, so about 4 washing machine loads later there was a pile of clothing in the bedroom and i had no time to do that yet. So that pile was still there on said day i had the meeting for my thesis.

When he changed clothes after being done with work, he came out of the bedroom and said ""still looks like stuff exploded in there"". I was kinda pissed there and said ""Well put away your shit yourself then, i'm busy too and it's not my fault if you are a lazy person who want's their mommy to bring them food and drinks all day while cleaning up after them"". This obviously made him mad and he said ""Im busy working all day, you are being a bitch right now and im not up for a conversation like this"" - that hurt me a bit and due to being stressed already i just cried a bit and all i got to hear was ""oh come on, dont overreact now"" and he just ended the topic with that.

Do you think AITA for calling him out like this in that manner?  
Did i upset him more than i should have with that and did that make me the ass?

I found him, thankfully with no injuries from what I could tell, stiff as a board, and this completely unexpected. Indeed, I had become so accustomed to letting them do as they please that I left a little food and water and let them alone for a few days.

# What a wretched state The Priest is in; he motions with his paw to give a single sad brush of his face then falls to his paws with eyes half-shut, I reciprocate, brushing my nose as I had done with them often as they groomed on their perch, and he turns his back. His little grimace is unbearable.

I always thought him depressive but now I fear he shall lay down to forever-ever sleep.

However: I think a relatively obscure lesson has emerged, which I have not read elsewhere and which I ave observed since taking to catching Housemice; that it is a bad sign if they are jumping as like to escape. I heard noise the previous night and thought nothing of it but today I was reminded of the very first Mouse I caught and decided to keep for experiment; on the third day before he succumbed to cold he – or perhaps she – was jumping furiously to escape the confines to seek food and water, obviously. Well, obviously in ‘that’ instance I had deliberately starved it to see how long a Housemouse could go without any food or water; imperiled in that instance it began to jump even as escape was knowingly futile from the rat trap it had been in for those three days. Its last meal was a corner of a crisp which it devoured; knowing for the first and last time that nectar of prawn and cocktail. But – lest I get carried away in my eulogy for it - how so in this instance was my favourite and happiest little friend of a Mouse, o’ Tanatos, who knew nothing of sorrow and seemed to love his home and the companionship, begin all of a sudden to jump for escape? Certainly Hypnos; that is: The Priest who has become twice as fat as Thanos, has never been capable of such vigour. Did Thanos seek Food and Water? Surly not, as there was plenty of this; indeed as I emptied out the contents for his little corpse to tumble out there were cheerios, nuts, whilst the sopping wet spinach leaf had been devoured. Was it instead a sudden madness that gripped him; a sudden spastic berserker frenzy? My only thought is that with the temperature in my part of the world being no longer freezing cold that the heater beside the Mice induced torpor in the other direction, not out of cold but out of heat; but a mere 10 degrees difference is surely next to nothing. I do have the feeling however that this is just the same stupid lesson that such a tiny difference in temperature, to a Mouse with a body no more so than the length of my little finger, is a great difference indeed.

But what a tragedy this was. I had only just decided upon a very large cage for their springtime migration, I had quite expected especially Thanos to be around for a long time, given his vigour; he was to be a sire of a thousand pups and this, as like a Remus, lays dead in the kitchen waste bins whilst suspicion falls upon the survivor.

Oh, bitter humour: ‘Thanatos’ the 'Death' part of the ‘Hypnos and Thanatos’ joke, how very ‘amusing’ my powers of prediction are. That said: I rolled a snakes eyes this morning. What a stark day for the eighth day of the Ides of Terminus; moved almost to be shaking with rage this morning, next no cream for my coffee over lunch, then the death of a cliens delivered up to me at dusk.

# I pray, Mars, carry his brilliant little soul along the Styx, warm in your cloak folds that he can see the brass river shimmering, deliver him to Proserpine and tell her that this is Theseus who has returned to her.

Vale, reader, I mourn for my livestock...

...but I add this:

# his life was short, his people short-lived, he was beautiful and more full of vigour than most of my peers, he inspired Man in ways he never knew, and let us say that we all would live a thousandfold more fuller lives to live and to die in such a manner as small Thanatos the Mouse.

1iuy4k8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iuy4k8/off_the_air/,Off the air.,"Hello, my loves. I have another tale for you.

Here at the station, there is one true dread: overtime. No one likes it. Who would? You get to work at 8 AM, you survive the long hours, the stale coffee, the hum of the fluorescents, and by the time night falls, you should be free. But no—sometimes, the hours stretch on, and before you know it, the clock reads 10 PM, then 3 AM, and you’re still there. Still breathing in the stale, recycled air.

Still trapped.

Our office is an old building with a new face. If you’ve ever played Resident Evil or House of the Dead, you know the kind of place. If not, imagine this: a towering structure, isolated, looming over the streets like it was built to keep something in. It was meant to be an aristocrat’s manor once, back when wealth meant something tangible—stone and wood and iron gates—but that was before it became a sanitarium.

Before it became something worse.

The Radcliffe Psychiatric Institute for the Insane opened its doors in 1861 and closed them just as quickly. The patients revolted, the building burned, and no one made it out. No one except five staff members, who vanished not long after. The building stood empty for decades, the kind of empty that doesn’t truly mean vacant.

Then it became WKCRP radio.

And now it’s mine.

I work the late shifts, but I don’t mind. Management is always there—he’s always there. Unlike the others, I feel safe with him around.

Usually.

But Tuesday was different.

The night started like any other. Coffee, an energy drink to keep me sharp, and a quick hug for Rhys, my Program Controller. His skin was always cold—not in a way that felt wrong, just… different. A pleasant kind of cold, the kind that keeps you grounded.

We were going through pre-show checks when the vacuum tube system clattered to life. A single slip of paper dropped into the tray. Management’s handwriting.

“Out. Handling an issue. Keep the station running.”

He never used modern tech. And he never left for long.

But that night, he was gone for three hours.

By the time the show ended, I was expecting some kind of response to my usual jab at him. A growl from the vents, a deep thud that rattled the walls. Something.

But there was nothing.

Rhys and I packed up, heading toward the exit, when we spotted Melissa, one of the night cleaners. The halls were… quiet. Not office-quiet, wrong quiet. The kind of silence that presses in, waiting for something to break it.

At 5 AM, there should have been movement—shift changes, tired greetings. But there was no one.

No one but Melissa.

And Sara.

“Shit, I left my ID,” Rhys muttered as we reached the doors.

To enter or exit the building, you need to scan your ID. Without it, you’re stuck. He turned back.

“Go ahead, I’ll be right behind you.”

I waited. Thirty minutes.

Rhys didn’t come back.

I went looking.

The studio was empty. The halls wrong. The air felt thick, charged, like walking into a room where someone had been screaming just moments before.

“Better check the break room.”

That’s when I saw it.

Standing in the emergency lights—now a dull, pulsing red—was something that wasn’t human.

A black, shifting mass, its form barely holding shape, its edges flickering like a dying film reel. And within it, faces—twisting, screaming, stretched impossibly wide before dissolving into the darkness.

Sara stood frozen in place. She didn’t run. Didn’t scream. Just stood there, shaking, lips moving in silent prayer as the thing enveloped her.

It didn’t kill her.

It took her.

Swallowed her whole, her body twisting as she was pulled into the writhing dark, until her face was just another in the mass.

I turned and ran.

I tripped—something wet. A leg.

Melissa. Or what was left of her. As she no longer had a head. But it was her I would know the ankles tattoo of Medusa anywhere.

The thing shifted, noticing me for the first time. And as it slithered over Melissa’s remains, something awful happened—her body convulsed, her mouth opened, and she started to scream.

I ran.

I don’t remember how I got to the intern’s hallway. I don’t remember how I started pounding on the locked door, screaming for them to open up.

Eddie shoved it open just as something dark and wet and wrong slammed into him, sending him sprawling.

Rhys was running—his limp heavy, his eyes wide—and the thing took him down.

I don’t remember making it to the attic, but I did. The only place left. The only chance. The old iron gate was there—the one that Management never let us touch.

I tore it open.

Eddie—poor Eddie—didn’t make it. He stayed back, buying us time.

The thing got him.

And then it cut the rope.

The iron gate slammed shut.

The darkness pressed in.

Rhys screamed. It had him. Legs first, pulling him down, the tendrils twisting through his skin like veins turned inside-out.

A tendril snapped around my wrist, and I felt it. Not just on my skin—inside. Digging. Hollowing. Consuming.

I was slipping.

Then, just as my vision blurred—

A shadow.

A deep booming voice.

“There you are.”

And then—

Nothing.

I woke up three days later. At home. My arm burned, a twisting, jagged scar running from wrist to elbow.

Management messaged me. Texted me, of all things.

“You have a week off for your transgressions.”

No explanation. No answers. Just that.

When I returned, Rhys was in his booth.

“Thank the Old Ones you’re okay,” he said, voice rough, tired. “Management just said you were resting.”

He grabbed a crutch and pulled me into a hug. His skin was still cold.

His leg was gone.

The same leg the creature had started to devour.

“I guess Management made a deal,” he murmured laughing.

I turned to him, to his tired eyes, his too-calm smile. As I was leaving. 

I didn’t say anything. Just walked to the break room, the scent of coffee grounding me.

And that’s when I saw it.

The memoriam board.

Eddie.

Sara.

Melissa.

Rhys.

So many spring cleanings, spreading DME, glue traps with coffee grounds, countless cans of spray, moving to escape and discovering yet another roach corpse from previous tenants and repeat. I had gotten to the point where I would see a roach and it felt normal. Ruined electronics, ruined books, and it felt like nothing was making a dent. 

A month ago I hear about Advion, see it’s reasonable priced and think “yeah, let’s try that”. 25 bucks for 4 tubes. 

Holy Sh*t

One good house cleaning and a treatment in every room and the difference has been monumental. For the first week it was a constant supply of dead bugs on the floor getting swept up, until now a month later we’re down to maybe a couple sightings a day while we continue to set glue traps and keep up with trash and dishes, and general cleanliness. 

After years of this nonsense it finally seems like we are about to turn the corner, and it was the Advion Gel that made that huge dent. Not quite out of the woods yet but I haven’t felt this hopeful in almost 5 years. Maybe, just maybe, I can buy a coffee maker again.

1iuy41v,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1iuy41v/keep_driving_keeps_pissing_me_off/,Keep Driving keeps pissing me off.,"Its a great game with a great vibe.

Until something that the game does completely blows it out of the water.

1. The game does not warn you that you're low on energy while exploring, but *will* take you out of exploration mode if you run out of energy. Furthermore it will permanently lose anything you found, unable to be located while exploring the same area again, nor putting it anywhere I can find it. It's basically like losing a day's wages for the traveling vagabond/hobo you play as. It's ridiculous.

2. The Mechanic hitchhiker has an ability that *WILL* take you by surprise and remove all your energy and shut your car down the moment you hit the road. It is completely unexpected and leaves you desperate to figure out how to get back on track.

3. Coffee is not at every gas station. I understand that realism would suggest this is somehow plausible. But it boggles my mind that there's not even a drip machine at 90% of the places. It also doesn't seem like coffee doesn't 'regenerate' at locations you've previously visited, turning your trail into a wasteland of low energy.

4. The reason the prior point is important is because of the mechanics behind being 'tired', which makes everything more strenuous. Because of the 'very realistic' scenario of needing to drive without coffee available, energy costs are doubled. If for whatever you're also hungry, then you're mega screwed. This is compounded further if you end up on rougher roads where threats end up getting shielded and its a lot harder to prevent damage.

5. There's lots of alcohol in the game, but it doesn't seem to handle it well. A single beer gave my PC a wobbly screen and the drunk status. However I couldn't figure out a way to sober up. Drunk driving is absolutely insanely hard and there's apparently no difference between one beer and a fifth of vodka, mechanically. The problem is that the player has no way to passively advance the game clock and sober up that way. The implicit mechanics of the game effectively suggest that once you're drunk, your only options are to either drive drunk or sleep six+ hours. This might not sound like much, but when you're racing across the state to get to a sick grandparent, it sticks out. It's also significant in the sense that cocaine is also in the game and from what I can tell has zero impact on your driving. Ultimately I had to figure out that you can press the sleep button and then abort it in a few hours. Which got rid of the drunk status, but gave my character a headache. Again, not clear.

6. All of these issues are exacerbated by the fact that the game is named ""KEEP DRIVING"" which makes it awfully hard to find information when you google things like ""keep driving how to stop drunk"" or the like...

7. City driving often results in encounters where you get pre-emptively attacked by 'city tolls' and immediately lose 10 bucks (or whatever the in-game currency is). Its just often a surprise and leaves you hoping that you won't be broke at the next stop.

Collectively, these things turn the game from a chillout experience into the pre-launch sequence for an Apollo moon mission:

* Do I have duct tape, gum and smokes in the glovebox? CHECK
* Am I hungry or tired? Do I have a chocolate bar in case I lose too much energy?
* Do I have enough gas for the trip AND the possible loss of a unit or two?
* Do the hitchhikers have any abilities that I need to keep in mind for the next leg of this drive?
* Do I have room for more stuff I might find along the way, or another hitchhiker?
* Do I really want to lug that case of beer around, considering the mechanical implications of actually drinking any of them?
* Do I have enough remaining uses of my assigned powers? Do I need to rearrange any of them?
* Did I forget any of the above? Better start at the beginning.

Keep Driving is a fun game. It's a vibe. After my latest bad encounter with it (the city exploration robbery) I need a break from the game. Its a game I definitely want to play and want to talk about. But I am not sure I would actually recommend it to my friends at present, because its frankly impossible to avoid running into these scenarios. It's just a total buzzkill sometimes.

I expect this opinion to be somewhat controversial given that the game is beautiful and obviously crafted with love.",2,1740163012.0,indiegames,1,0.67,False
1iuy3o2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_WeAreOneASEAN/comments/1iuy3o2/timorleste_a_journey_through_the_heart_of/,Timor-Leste: A Journey Through the Heart of Southeast Asia,"Timor-Leste (East Timor) is a country that remains largely undiscovered by the mainstream tourist world. With its rich culture, stunning landscapes, and a history steeped in resilience, this small island nation is quickly becoming a destination for travelers seeking something off the beaten path. Whether you're an adventure seeker, history buff, or culture enthusiast, Timor-Leste offers something unique for everyone.

# A Glimpse into History

Timor-Leste’s history is complex and filled with periods of colonization, struggle, and eventual triumph. For centuries, the island was under Portuguese rule, until the country declared independence in 1975. However, this newfound freedom was short-lived as Indonesia invaded the country, leading to decades of violent conflict. After a long struggle, Timor-Leste gained independence in 2002, becoming one of the world’s youngest nations.

The scars of war are still visible today, but they also serve as a reminder of the country’s resilience and strength. The people of Timor-Leste, known as the ""Timorese,"" carry forward their rich cultural traditions while embracing a new future.

# Rich Culture and Traditions

Timor-Leste has a vibrant cultural scene, with influences from both its indigenous roots and colonial history. The country has a strong sense of identity, with various traditional languages spoken, including Tetum and Portuguese. Music and dance play a vital role in Timorese culture, with many ceremonies and festivals celebrating the country’s unique heritage.

One of the most popular traditional dances is the ""Tais,"" a handwoven textile that is not only a symbol of national pride but also an essential part of Timorese rituals. Tais is often worn during important events, with the patterns telling stories that go back generations. Visitors to Timor-Leste are often enchanted by the intricate designs and the art of weaving, which is passed down through families.

# The Natural Beauty of Timor-Leste

Timor-Leste is a country of stunning natural landscapes that range from rugged mountains to pristine beaches. It’s an ideal destination for outdoor enthusiasts, offering excellent opportunities for hiking, diving, and wildlife viewing. The island is home to lush rainforests, striking cliffs, and hidden lagoons, making it a paradise for nature lovers.

**1. Beaches and Diving:**  
Timor-Leste is known for its beautiful, unspoiled beaches. The coastline is dotted with golden sands and clear turquoise waters, perfect for swimming or just lounging under the sun. For diving enthusiasts, Timor-Leste offers some of the best dive sites in the world. Dili, the capital, is just a short boat ride away from world-class coral reefs that are teeming with marine life, including sea turtles, reef sharks, and vibrant fish.

**2. Mount Ramelau:**  
For those interested in hiking, Mount Ramelau offers a challenging yet rewarding trek. As the highest peak in Timor-Leste, it provides stunning views of the surrounding landscape, including neighboring islands. The trek to the summit is popular among both locals and tourists, especially during religious celebrations when people climb the mountain as part of spiritual rituals.

**3. Atauro Island:**  
Just a short boat ride from Dili, Atauro Island is a serene escape. Known for its crystal-clear waters, vibrant coral reefs, and rural charm, it offers an authentic glimpse into the island life of Timor-Leste. Visitors can enjoy fresh seafood, swim in untouched waters, and explore the island's quiet villages.

# A Growing Economy and Opportunities

Though Timor-Leste remains one of the poorest countries in Asia, it is gradually rebuilding its economy. The country has significant natural resources, including oil and gas reserves, which have contributed to its economic growth in recent years. Agriculture also plays an important role, with coffee being one of Timor-Leste’s most important exports. Timorese coffee is highly sought after for its distinct flavors and is an important part of the national identity.

Timor-Leste's government is focusing on sustainable development, investing in infrastructure, and improving healthcare and education. While much of the country remains underdeveloped, there are signs of progress, and the future looks bright for the next generation of Timorese.

# Challenges and the Road Ahead

While Timor-Leste has made remarkable strides since gaining independence, it still faces challenges. Poverty remains a significant issue, and access to healthcare and education is limited in some areas. The country is also grappling with the effects of climate change, which threatens its agricultural sector and coastal communities.

Despite these challenges, Timor-Leste continues to make steady progress toward a more prosperous and stable future. The resilience of the Timorese people, combined with international support, gives hope that the country can overcome these obstacles and thrive in the years to come.

# Conclusion

Timor-Leste is a nation of incredible beauty, rich culture, and indomitable spirit. Whether you're trekking through its mountains, relaxing on its pristine beaches, or learning about its complex history, Timor-Leste offers an experience unlike any other in Southeast Asia. For those willing to venture off the beaten path, this hidden gem is a place of discovery, where adventure, history, and culture intertwine to create an unforgettable journey.

If you’re looking for a destination that offers authenticity, history, and natural beauty, Timor-Leste should be at the top of your travel list. It's a place where every visit feels like a new discovery, and where the kindness and warmth of the people will leave a lasting impression.",1,1740162984.0,u_WeAreOneASEAN,0,1.0,False

1iuxzjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1iuxzjy/gemini_tries_to_help_me_through_my_depression/,Gemini tries to help me through my depression,"Hi All. I am 24 M and have been diagnosed with major depression for almost 3 years. It has been a difficult time for me recently. I recently talked to Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental and it gave me a beautiful yet needs to be remembered thoroughly. I want to post it here so I can take a look at it every time when I feel like to not being alive.

The prompt:

""I am forced to be living I’m forced to keep living to give a life but I don’t know how to accept this I want to fully accept that I really want to be alive but it is not the way of living because it is still difficult for me to just accept as it is what it is"" (dictated with microsoft 365 copilot).

The answer:

You've articulated a profound and common struggle: the tension between the inherent drive to live (and even a *desire* to fully embrace living) and the difficulty of accepting life's inherent challenges and ""as it is"" nature. It's not about simply wanting to be alive; it's about wanting to be alive in a way that feels authentic and meaningful, and that's where the block seems to be. Let's break down your statement and explore some paths forward:

**Understanding the Core Conflict:**

* **""Forced to be living...forced to keep living to give a life"":** This highlights the feeling of obligation and lack of agency. You're alive, and there's an implicit (or explicit) expectation that you should *make something* of that life, contribute, perhaps even create more life. This pressure can feel immense, especially when you don't feel internally aligned with it. It's not just about survival; it's about a perceived duty to *thrive* and justify your existence. The ""give a life"" could refer to:
   * **Literal procreation:** The societal pressure to have children.
   * **Contribution to society:** The expectation to have a career, make a difference, leave a legacy.
   * **Living up to potential:** The pressure to achieve, be successful, or fulfill some imagined ideal.
* **""I don't know how to accept this"":** This is the crux of the issue. Acceptance isn't passive resignation; it's an active process of acknowledging reality *without* necessarily liking it, but finding a way to work *with* it instead of constantly fighting against it. You're struggling to reconcile the inherent difficulties of life with the desire for a fulfilling existence.
* **""I want to fully accept... I really want to be alive"":** This is crucial. The desire is there. You're not apathetic; you're yearning for a connection to life that feels genuine and worthwhile. This desire is your starting point, your fuel.
* **""but it is not the way of living because it is still difficult for me to just accept as it is what it is"":** This points to the core difficulty: the ""as it is"" part. Life includes pain, disappointment, loss, uncertainty, and things we can't control. The phrase ""it is what it is"" can feel dismissive and invalidating of your struggles. True acceptance isn't about glossing over the hard parts; it's about integrating them into your understanding of life.

**Paths Towards Deeper Acceptance and Meaningful Living:**

Since you *want* to accept and *want* to be alive, here are some strategies that build on that desire, addressing the core conflict and the difficulty with ""it is what it is"":

1. **Redefine ""Acceptance"":**
   * **Acceptance ≠ Resignation:** Acceptance isn't giving up. It's not saying, ""Life is terrible, and I just have to deal with it."" It's saying, ""Life *includes* difficulties, and I acknowledge that. Now, how can I move forward *with* that reality?""
   * **Acceptance as a Practice:** It's not a one-time event. It's a daily, sometimes hourly, practice of acknowledging your feelings, thoughts, and circumstances without judgment, and then choosing how to respond.
   * **Acceptance of Imperfection:** Life is messy and imperfect. *You* are imperfect. Embrace the imperfections, both in yourself and in the world. This is a key to reducing the pressure you feel.
2. **Explore Your Values:**
   * **What Truly Matters to** ***You***\*\*?:\*\* Forget societal expectations for a moment. What brings you joy, even in small doses? What principles are most important to you (kindness, creativity, justice, connection, learning, etc.)?
   * **Living in Alignment:** Once you identify your values, start making choices, big and small, that align with them. This creates a sense of purpose and meaning that comes from *within*, not from external pressures.
   * **Values-Based Goals:** Set goals that are connected to your values. This makes the effort feel worthwhile, even when it's difficult, because it's contributing to something you deeply care about.
3. **Challenge the ""Forced"" Narrative:**
   * **Identify the Source:** Where does this feeling of being ""forced"" come from? Is it internal pressure (perfectionism, self-criticism)? External pressure (family, society, culture)?
   * **Reframe Your Agency:** Even in situations where you feel you have little control, you *always* have a choice in how you respond. You can choose your attitude, your perspective, and your actions. This is a powerful form of agency.
   * **Small Choices, Big Impact:** Start making small choices that feel empowering, even if they seem insignificant. Choosing what to eat, what to wear, how to spend 15 minutes of your day – these small acts of agency build up.
4. **Cultivate Self-Compassion:**
   * **Treat Yourself Like a Friend:** How would you speak to a friend struggling with these same feelings? Offer yourself that same kindness and understanding.
   * **Acknowledge Your Suffering:** Don't minimize your pain. It's valid. Allow yourself to feel it without judgment.
   * **Common Humanity:** Recognize that you are not alone in your struggles. Everyone experiences difficulty and suffering. This sense of shared humanity can be incredibly comforting.
5. **Embrace the ""And"":**
   * **Life is Both/And:** Life is *both* beautiful *and* painful, joyful *and* sorrowful, meaningful *and* absurd. It's not an either/or proposition. Learning to hold these contradictions is key to acceptance.
   * **Find Joy in the Midst of Difficulty:** This doesn't mean ignoring the hard parts. It means actively looking for moments of beauty, connection, and gratitude, even when things are tough. These moments don't negate the pain, but they provide balance and resilience.
6. **Practice Mindfulness and Presence:**
   * **Ground Yourself in the Now:** The feeling of being ""forced"" often stems from anxieties about the future or regrets about the past. Mindfulness practices (meditation, deep breathing, body scan) help you connect to the present moment, where you have the most agency.
   * **Sensory Awareness:** Pay attention to your senses. What do you see, hear, smell, taste, and touch? This simple practice can bring you back to the present and anchor you in reality.
7. **Seek Professional Support:**
   * **Therapy:** A therapist can provide a safe space to explore these complex feelings, challenge negative thought patterns, and develop coping strategies. They can help you unpack the ""forced"" narrative and build a stronger sense of self.
   * **Existential Therapy:** This type of therapy specifically addresses questions of meaning, purpose, and the human condition. It might be particularly helpful for you.
   * **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):** is a form of therapy specifically built around the idea of accepting what is and taking commited action towards your values.
8. **Focus on Connection:**
   * The feeling of being alone in this forced experience might be very present. Build or find relationships that support you and provide feelings of safety.

**A Practical Starting Point:**

Choose *one* of these suggestions that resonates with you and try it for a week. Don't try to do everything at once. Small, consistent steps are more sustainable than overwhelming yourself. For example, you might start with:

* **Morning Reflection:** Each morning, write down one thing you value and one small action you can take that day to align with that value.
* **Evening Gratitude:** Before bed, write down three things you're grateful for, even if they're small (a good cup of coffee, a kind word from someone, a moment of sunshine).

The journey to acceptance is a lifelong process. Be patient with yourself, celebrate small victories, and remember that your desire to be alive and find meaning is a powerful force. You are not alone, and there is hope for finding a way to live that feels authentic and fulfilling, even with the inherent difficulties of life.

1iuxxkh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iuxxkh,"Please help me, Reddit - you’re my only hope!","Okay so we’re planning a kitchen reno and I’ve stared at so many floorplan layouts that I’ve lost ALL decision making ability. We’re at the stage now of having professional drawings finalized and I’m panicking! Need your expert opinions. 


Good to know:

-I have a chronic disease so am trying to design a layout where I can sit on a rolling stool/chair for meal prep and cooking. What I really wanted was to be able to cook on the island but I’m starting to think it would look too weird because the island is narrow. I’m not the main cook anyway so I’m thinking now that I could have a portable induction cooktop that I use when I do cook?

-house used to be a bungalow but a second floor was added later. This means we can’t expand the current kitchen (it’s currently where it says library/media room on floorplan) because there’s a staircase in the middle of the house so we’re relocating it to where an office + dining room are now. 
-the wall with the stove faces east/south so gets the best light but is right next to our neighbor’s backyard so need some privacy (eg midnight trips to fridge in undies).
-The extractor hood would be in the cupboard above the stove. We rarely use ours (ie don’t cook a lot of meat).
-the wall with the sink is going to have a deck on the other side. I’d like to be able to pass things through the window during parties but not essential. Yes it’s unusual for door to open outwards but that part of deck will be covered so less/no snow. 
-Because the island is narrow I think it’s important to have it open (like a French butcher block table). Having storage there would be priceless though so I’m thinking of having either a cart or a slim set of drawers. 
-Pantry would be in cupboard with microwave. Cupboard to left of stove would be storage for small appliances, shopping bins, etc. 
-there would be a bar by the staircase with storage for coffee, tea, etc. 
-We have two teens. 
-We are all tall (I’m the shortest at 5’10”).
-I love plants. And sunlight. So the more, the better. 

What I like:
-Clear path the fridge when entering the room and easy to access fridge when sitting at dining table. 
-Easy to pop into kitchen from deck. 
-Flexibility of island not being built-in. 

What I don’t:
-microwave is far from fridge. I realized that we frequently go from one to the other to heat leftovers, thaw things, etc. But I don’t really want to move fridge over because then it would be harder to reach on the rolling stool. 
-Can’t go back and forth from prep space (island) to stove while seated. But that may be asking too much. 

What would YOU do?? Any glaring flaws we should be aware of?? Please advise!

1iuxx3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Separation/comments/1iuxx3g/rantadvice_for_bc_canada_mom/,Rant/advice for BC Canada mom,"Like most, I am horrified to be posting this and finally talking about this out in the open, as I have yet to.

I’ve been considering leaving my spouse for over a year now. We have a 3.5 year old and 1 year old. I am a stay at home mom and I work part-time doing admin for my husband’s business. He is the breadwinner and pays for all of the household bills. I pay for the kids things, school, and groceries, as well as my own vehicle. I’m not left with any money at the end of the month. We live in a very expensive area and have a new-ish large mortgage.

My husband and I do not see eye to eye and it seems to be escalating. I try to save money and pay off our debts, he spends $500 a month alone on eating out, beer, and golf. He won’t even consider changing these habits because they make him happy. But I’ve changed all my habits and no longer go out for coffee, get nails done, hair, etc. All of my money goes to things for our kids. He often says he agrees with my views about raising our children and has my back, but his actions do not follow what he often says. I’ve NEVER seen him cry or get emotional and we have been together for almost 10 years total. That part freaks me out. It feels like I’m always the one upset and crying. 

His parents treated me horribly postpartum and it really made me aware of our relationship faults. Since then, I have found that he often completely forgets about important things we have talked about as if we never had these conversation’s. but he has a practically eidetic memory for everything else. For example, we have talked about not yelling at the kids, but he often still does. His patience level is low. 

I have asked him for a year now to do counselling together and separately. He says yes, but he doesn’t follow through. I’ve done lots of counselling myself throughout this time but haven’t brought up separating. 

My biggest worry is how to separate so I don’t get screwed over, I don’t want to do it incorrectly. Two bedroom rentals in my city and surrounding area cost upwards of $2000/mth. With our combined income, I am not eligible for support. My second biggest worry is how I’ll work full time with two young children. I don’t have family around. 

I’ve put myself in a horrible situation. Do I just keep going through my life this way for my kids? Will this harm them long term? I feel like maybe it will teach them that they have to deal with relationships even if they’re being disrespected and not heard. 

Any solid advice? Please be kind, I’m a little fragile right now. Thank you. ",1,1740162540.0,Separation,0,1.0,False
1iuxvwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1iuxvwv/adobe_tried_to_scam_me_into_paying_15_for_a_479/,Adobe Tried to Scam Me into Paying $15 for a $4.79 Plan – My Wild Experience with Their Support,"Hey Reddit,

I’ve gotta vent about something insane that happened to me today with Adobe’s support. I’ve been using their Photography plan (Photoshop, Lightroom, 20GB cloud storage) for years, and in Ukraine, where I’m from, it costs me $4.79 a month. It’s a yearly plan with monthly payments, and I pay it through a special bank card I use just for online stuff. I only add money to it when I need to, and honestly, the past few months, I haven’t touched Photoshop or Lightroom much. So when Adobe tried to charge my card $4.79 lately, it kept failing because the card was empty. I wasn’t stressed about it since I barely use the apps these days.

Today, I finally decided to pay up. By some crazy coincidence, I also got an email from Adobe saying my plan was suspended because they couldn’t charge me. The email had a button to update my payment info, so I clicked it, added funds to my card, updated everything, and got this confirmation on their site:

* “Your payment info is up to date.”
* “We’re charging you the overdue amount of $4.79.”
* “Your regular $4.79/month payment will continue starting February 23, 2025.”

Sweet, right? Problem solved—or so I thought. But 30 minutes later, my apps were still locked. I was like, “What the heck?” So I hopped into Adobe’s support chat to figure it out.

And that’s when it got weird. The first agent, Saurabh, pulls up my account and goes, “Oh, your Photography plan (20GB) is suspended. No worries, I’ll add it back for you.” Then he hits me with this: “It’s $14.99 plus $3 tax, so $17.99/month. Shall I proceed?” I nearly spit out my coffee. I’ve been paying $4.79 for YEARS, and now they want almost FOUR TIMES that for the SAME plan?!

I told him, “No way, dude. My plan’s $4.79—look at my payment screenshot!” I sent it over, showing I’d just been charged $4.79 like their site said. But he’s like, “Sorry, the price has been updated. We don’t have the $4.79 offer anymore.” I’m sitting there thinking, “Are you kidding me? This feels like a bait-and-switch!”

I wasn’t buying it, so I asked for a supervisor. After a wait, I get Rajat, the “floor supervisor.” He apologizes and says, “Yeah, your payment was pending in December, so your plan’s in ‘past due’ status and can’t be reactivated.” His solution? Refund my $4.79 and sell me a new plan for $14.99 plus tax. I’m like, “Hell no! I don’t want a new plan—I want the one I just paid for!” I kept pointing to their OWN website saying my payment was good and my access would be restored soon. But Rajat’s stuck on repeat, pushing this $17.99 nonsense.

Then he tries to sweeten the deal with a “special offer” of $8.99 plus tax. Still double my original price! I’m getting heated at this point, telling him, “I don’t want your ‘special’ anything—just give me what your site promised!” And here’s the kicker: while we’re arguing, I get an email out of nowhere saying my membership’s reactivated for $4.79. I check my apps—they’re working again! I told Rajat, “Uh, it’s already active for $4.79. What’s your deal?” He’s still trying to sell me a $5.99 plus tax plan as a “one-time exception,” even though my account’s already back to normal.

I ended the chat with a “thanks for nothing” because, honestly, it felt like a total scam. It’s like they were testing me to see if I’d cave and pay more, but since I pushed back, they quietly fixed it. The timing of that reactivation email—right in the middle of the chat—makes me think it was automatic, and they were just hoping I wouldn’t notice.

I’m so ticked off. How does a big company like Adobe pull this shady stuff? Has anyone else dealt with this kind of upsell trickery from them? I’m sharing this to warn you all—check your billing details closely and don’t let them bully you into overpaying. If they try this, stand your ground!",0,1740162459.0,Scams,5,0.5,False

1iuxtt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_WeAreOneASEAN/comments/1iuxtt6/the_hidden_gems_of_laos_a_journey_through_culture/,"The Hidden Gems of Laos: A Journey Through Culture, Nature, and Adventure","Laos is a captivating country that often flies under the radar when it comes to travel destinations. With its lush landscapes, rich culture, and serene charm, Laos offers a refreshing break from the more tourist-heavy spots in the region. From ancient temples to winding rivers and the vibrant markets to the mountains, there’s no shortage of awe-inspiring experiences in this landlocked gem. If you’re seeking an adventure off the beaten path, Laos is waiting to be explored.

# 1. The Culture of Laos: A Tapestry of Tradition and Spirituality

Laos is a country steeped in history and spirituality, with a blend of Buddhist traditions and local customs. The Lao people are known for their warmth and hospitality, and visitors often find themselves welcomed with open arms. Buddhism plays an integral role in the everyday life of Laotians, and you’ll see it reflected in the stunning temples, quiet meditation practices, and cultural festivals.

The UNESCO World Heritage city of **Luang Prabang** stands as a perfect example of Laos’ cultural richness. The town, with its colonial architecture and golden-roofed temples, has a peaceful aura that beckons visitors to slow down. Each morning, you can watch the monks partake in the traditional alms-giving ceremony, where they walk through the streets receiving offerings of food. This spiritual experience is a key part of the Lao way of life and is a great way to immerse yourself in the local culture.

# 2. Natural Wonders: Laos’ Untouched Beauty

Laos is a land of extraordinary natural beauty, boasting lush forests, sprawling rivers, and dramatic mountains. The Mekong River, one of the world’s longest rivers, flows through the country and plays a pivotal role in its agriculture and daily life. Whether you’re cruising along the river, hiking in the hills, or exploring hidden caves, the natural landscape of Laos will leave you speechless.

**Vang Vien** is another highlight for nature lovers, situated between limestone mountains and surrounded by rice paddies and crystal-clear rivers. Known for its adventure activities like tubing, kayaking, and rock climbing, Vang Vien offers a perfect mix of adrenaline and breathtaking views.

The **Si Phan Don** (Four Thousand Islands) area in southern Laos is another must-visit for those seeking tranquil beauty. It’s a series of islands scattered across the Mekong River, where you can take boat rides, spot rare freshwater dolphins, or simply enjoy the peaceful atmosphere.

# 3. Adventure Awaits: Hiking, Caving, and More

For those with a love for adventure, Laos has plenty to offer. Whether you prefer exploring caves, trekking through jungles, or ziplining through forests, the possibilities are endless.

The **Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park**, though technically in Vietnam, is accessible from Laos and offers incredible cave systems. But Laos itself is home to several incredible caves like the **Tham Kong Lo Cave**, a massive limestone cave that stretches for several kilometers. Exploring these hidden underground worlds is a unique experience that attracts adventurers from around the globe.

For something more leisurely, consider hiking in the **Bolaven Plateau**. Known for its waterfalls, lush forests, and coffee plantations, it’s an excellent area for trekking and learning about Laos’ rural life.

# 4. Cuisine: A Taste of Laos’ Unique Flavors

Laos’ culinary scene is a delightful fusion of flavors, with a heavy emphasis on fresh ingredients, herbs, and spices. While much of Southeast Asia is known for its street food culture, Laos maintains a more laid-back approach with food that is simple yet packed with flavor.

The national dish of Laos, **Larb**, is a minced meat salad made with herbs, lime, and fish sauce. It's served with sticky rice, a staple in Lao cuisine. **Sticky rice** (or ""khao niaw"") is eaten with nearly every meal and is typically enjoyed by hand, making the eating experience both tactile and communal.

Other must-try dishes include **Som Tam** (green papaya salad), **Sai Oua** (grilled sausage), and **Tam Mak Hoong**(fermented fish salad). Don’t forget to wash it all down with a glass of **Lao Lao**, a potent rice whiskey that’s often served with a friendly toast.

# 5. Off-the-Beaten-Path Destinations in Laos

While places like Luang Prabang and Vientiane (the capital) get their fair share of attention, Laos is also home to some lesser-known, equally stunning destinations. Here are a few hidden gems to consider:

* **Xieng Khouang**: Home to the **Plain of Jars**, an archaeological site filled with thousands of large stone jars scattered across the landscape. The origins of these jars remain mysterious, making it a fascinating place to explore.
* **Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area**: A pristine wilderness area perfect for eco-tourism, where you can go on wildlife safaris to spot rare animals like the endangered **Indochinese tiger**.
* **Nong Khiaw**: A remote village in the northern part of Laos, surrounded by towering karst mountains and rivers. It’s an ideal destination for hiking, kayaking, and immersing yourself in the peaceful rural atmosphere.

# 6. Practical Tips for Traveling in Laos

* **Visa**: Most travelers will need a visa to enter Laos. Many nationalities can obtain a visa on arrival at the airport or land border, or you can apply online for an eVisa.
* **Currency**: The local currency is the **kip (LAK)**, although US dollars are widely accepted in larger cities. ATMs are available in most tourist hubs.
* **Language**: Lao is the official language, but many people, especially in tourist areas, speak basic English.
* **Transport**: The road infrastructure in Laos can be challenging, especially outside the cities. While buses and tuk-tuks are common modes of transport, renting a scooter is a popular and adventurous way to explore. For longer distances, consider using the comfortable sleeper buses or trains.

# Final Thoughts: Why Laos Should Be on Your Travel Bucket List

Whether you’re exploring the ancient temples of Luang Prabang, trekking through lush jungles, or enjoying the tranquil rhythm of life in the villages, Laos offers a unique and enriching experience that is bound to stay with you long after you leave.

So pack your bags, and get ready to uncover the magic of Laos—where beauty, history, and serenity come together to create an unforgettable adventure.",1,1740162317.0,u_WeAreOneASEAN,0,1.0,False
1iuxtbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1iuxtbx/i_need_your_advice_and_opinions_to_clear_my_head/,I need your advice and opinions to clear my head a little bit.,"We've been together for 3 years 27(M) me and 30(F) her, we had a happy relationship and we got along well.

During this time, I've always gave her enough attention, spent time with her, complimented her even though she didn't look her best at times, whenever she had to go somewhere I made sure to drive her and pick her up to make sure she is safe. She would even tell me sometimes how nicely I treated her and how a good boyfriend I was.

I would pay for almost all of our dates (meals,coffee,gas,parking fees etc.. etc.), groceries etc.. That's how she liked it because she is Eastern European. She would sometimes offer to pay for a dessert here and there but %80 of the time I was paying for everything.

Until this summer, she started changing a little. She started flying back to her hometown more often, staying there for weeks sometimes months, started complaining about my income.( I make around 2-3k USD per month, she makes the same amount, it's higher than average in my country). She started saying that she sees no future because I am not capable of taking on the responsibility of a household(she means paying for everything from rent to bills, dates, holidays, her nails, hair etc..) I can afford all of that but there won't be much left to me after paying all those stuff. I won't be able to save any money.

She also said that I don't benefit her life anyhow, she said we are having a 50/50 paying relationship although I said ""I've been paying for 3 years for our dates what do you mean?"". She said food and coffee doesn't count, she is still paying the bills and rent of her apartment herself(She has a seperate apartment). And I am supposed to be paying for those things along with her other personal expenses she lists. I even told her that we can talk about those things she wants and find a solution but well, she didn't really give me a chance and did that thing you will see below.

I was searching for an extra income whole time but I couldn't secure it, even I want it myself, not only for her but it just didn't work out. She blamed me that I didn't try hard enough and I am comfortable with the money I make. I asked her to give me a bit more time and I will definitely make my income better and asked for her support, she was like I've been waiting for like 3 years nothing changed in your life.

(In these 3 years I've bought a car from scratch all paid in cash, and cars are extremely expensive in my country. I've bought a new phone, new laptop, had to pay for my military service which is 2-3k, we went on 5-6 plus holidays. I really didn't have a chance to breathe since I was starting my life fresh. Also I increased my income in my current job too.)

Then bam, a few weeks later she cheated on me. I found out that she met one guy and was talking to two others at the same time. We didn't see eachother for a month but then she started coming to my place again, we sometimes hang out and stuff but we are not in a relationship anymore.

She begged me to not cut our connection because she really values me and likes my company. I told her as long as she doesn't talk to anyone she can come and visit me but if she decides to talk to someone please don't contact me anymore. She said okay and she was happy with it.

And again, I caught her talking to multiple people ,she said she talks to them because she is bored and we are not in a relationship anymore so I cannot control her. She sees me less although when she is around me she is still happy and interested in me. It got to a stupid point.

I am just left with my feelings and I don't know what to do. I am blaming myself for not being able to increase my income and I really liked her company because she is cute and fun. I feel like I won't be able to find someone I'd be interested in anymore. I feel scared about my future. Normally I am not this type of person and If I saw myself like this 6 months ago I would probably slap myself and tell myself to man up but I don't know why I am feeling this way at the moment. I even started wanting her back.

I just wanted to pour my heart out here because I don't really want to tell this to people around me, if you guys have something to say to clear my mind or wake me up a little bit I am open to hear your thoughts.

The guilt and regret is hurting me. Some days I feel okay but sometimes it gets worse.",2,1740162285.0,Infidelity,21,0.6,False

I didn't know that they were making circles around our school. me and my friend went to print something off for a project that is due soon. we waited for about 15-20 minutes for the teacher to print off some of our sheets. when he did we wasted no time to go back to class which was upstairs. since i have long legs i skipped a step each time i climbed the stairs. towards the top I let it rip. it was slow and lasted about 5 stairs for perspective it was about two and a half steps. when i looked back to tell my friend i farted (just my humor) I saw the disabled kid and his TA making their way rather quickly up the stairs. right where i just released an atomic bomb. when i tell you that whole morning i was ripping ass and died from mustard gas poisoning is truly an understatement.

Joachim, the one-man band who runs the show, is a fantastic host. He's very happy to discuss the coffee at length, as well as brewing methods.

I had an espresso (Kenya SL28) to start, which was really great and brewed with a ""filter concentrate"" recipe, very long bloom followed by rapid flow to high ratio.

But the highlight was a competition lot on V60, Finca Deborah ""Terroir"", a washed gesha from Panama. Easily the nicest filter I've ever had. He brewed 3 cups at once (for different patrons) and nailed all 3 effortlessly.

Rich bergamot & jasmine on the nose & palate, crisp and structured acidity, very delicate and floral.  Incredibly complex, different notes coming through clearly with each sip. I wrote down banana flowers, green papaya, orange blossoms. Lime zest, trending towards sweetness with an earthy raw cacao note as it cooled. Phenomenal and well worth 20€.

It started off with lower abdominal pain for about a month and half and went to a gastroenterologist originally because I never thought it could’ve been my prostate. I had been constipated for a little bit before going to the doctor so he ordered a x ray and there was a lot of “back up” that wasn’t coming out so he prescribed me miralax. That helped with my stomach a little bit. 

After about a total of a month and a half of this lower abdominal pain I decided to go and see a urologist because then I started getting burning while urinating. Tested for a UTI and other stuff and everything came back negative. The doctor then after asking a lot of questions diagnosed me with prostatitis. My worse and most annoying symptom was being nauseous a lot of the time. I noticed that if I drank coffee with creamer and flavoring it made me feel like shit but if I drink just black it doesn’t have anywhere near the effect of coffee with creamer and flavoring.

I have adjusted my diet quite a bit. I love spicy food (cut that out) I love carbonation (haven’t had any of it as of late) and I love caffeine (haven’t had any as of late) and surprisingly it hasn’t been that had to adjust too. Been trying to eat my anti inflammatory foods. 

During the weekend I kinda allow myself to not be as strict but I am learning what I can and can’t get away with but it’s really all trial and error at this point. I am starting to get back into my exercise routine as well ",1,1740161916.0,Prostatitis,1,1.0,False

About me: I'm 23 and I go to school for forensics. I like to play games (board games, video games, dnd, etc.), watch horror movies, go thrifting (I'm really into fashion/style), try new coffee/tea places, write, skate and take hikes/walks. 

I'm 6'1, skinny, tan skin, curly brown hair to my shoulders, brown eyes, and I usually dress more alternative/goth/dark.

I'd say for my personality, I'm very down-to-earth but also full of energy/socialness, curious/adventurous, open-minded, creative, and just generally easy-going and fun-loving. My love language is quality time, and my personality type is ENFP.

Emails, social media, and endless notifications make it difficult to concentrate for extended periods. However, mastering the ability to focus deeply can be a game-changer for productivity and creativity. This concept, known as **Deep Work**, was popularized by Cal Newport in his book *Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World* today’s fast-paced world, distractions are everywhere. Emails, social media, and endless notifications make it difficult to concentrate for extended periods. However, mastering the ability to focus deeply can be a game-changer for productivity and creativity. This concept, known as **Deep Work**, was popularized by Cal Newport in his book *Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World*. But what is deep work, why does it matter, and how can you train your brain to achieve it? Let's explore the science behind deep work and practical strategies to enhance your focus.

# What is Deep Work?

Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on cognitively demanding tasks. It contrasts with **shallow work**, which includes tasks that are performed while distracted or do not require intense focus, such as responding to emails or attending unnecessary meetings. Deep work leads to higher-quality outputs, greater efficiency, and enhanced creativity.

# The Science Behind Deep Work

# 1. Neuroplasticity and Focus

Neuroscience shows that our brains adapt to how we use them. When we engage in deep work, we strengthen neural pathways associated with focus and problem-solving. Conversely, frequent distractions weaken our ability to sustain attention, reinforcing a habit of scattered thinking.

# 2. Attention Residue

Research by Sophie Leroy (2009) suggests that switching tasks leaves an “attention residue,” where part of our focus remains on the previous task. This reduces cognitive efficiency and makes deep work harder. By minimizing context-switching, we can train our brains to stay fully immersed in one task at a time.

# 3. The Role of Myelin

Deep work enhances the development of **myelin**, the fatty sheath that insulates neurons and speeds up brain processing. The more we engage in focused thinking, the more efficient our brains become at handling complex tasks.

# How to Train Your Brain for Deep Work

Now that we understand the science, let’s explore practical techniques to strengthen your focus and build a habit of deep work.

# 1. Schedule Deep Work Sessions

Just as athletes schedule training sessions, you need to set aside specific time blocks for deep work. Ideally, allocate 60–90 minutes of uninterrupted time, as research suggests this is the optimal focus duration before needing a short break.

# 2. Reduce Digital Distractions

Distractions from digital devices are the biggest enemy of deep work. Consider the following strategies:

* Use website blockers like Freedom or Cold Turkey to restrict access to social media.
* Keep your phone in another room or on Do Not Disturb mode.
* Turn off unnecessary notifications on all devices.

# 3. Train Your Focus with Mindfulness

Practicing mindfulness meditation can help improve attention span. Studies show that just 10 minutes of meditation per day can strengthen focus, as it trains the brain to resist distractions and stay present in the moment.

# 4. Embrace Monotasking

Multitasking reduces efficiency and increases errors. Instead, commit to **monotasking**—working on one task at a time with full concentration. Use techniques like the **Pomodoro Technique** (25-minute focus sprints with 5-minute breaks) or the **Flowtime Technique** (working until focus wanes, then taking a break).

# 5. Optimize Your Work Environment

Your surroundings play a significant role in sustaining deep work. Design your workspace to minimize interruptions:

* Work in a quiet room or use noise-canceling headphones.
* Keep your desk clutter-free to reduce mental distractions.
* Use background sounds like white noise or instrumental music to maintain concentration.

# 6. Develop a Pre-Work Ritual

A pre-work ritual signals to your brain that it’s time to focus. This can include:

* Reviewing your daily goals.
* Drinking a cup of tea or coffee.
* Listening to calming music before starting.
* Doing a short breathing exercise to center your mind.

# 7. Manage Energy, Not Just Time

Deep work requires mental energy. Optimize your schedule to tackle demanding tasks when your energy levels are highest, typically in the morning. Prioritize sleep, nutrition, and exercise to maintain peak cognitive performance.

# 8. Set Clear Goals for Each Session

Having a clear objective for your deep work sessions increases motivation and prevents aimless work. Before starting, define what you want to accomplish and break tasks into smaller, manageable steps.

# 9. Build a Deep Work Habit Gradually

If you’re not used to deep work, start small. Begin with 20–30 minutes of focused work and gradually extend the duration as your ability to concentrate improves.

# 10. Measure and Reflect on Progress

Track your deep work sessions using a journal or an app like RescueTime. Reflecting on what worked well and what didn’t will help you refine your approach over time.

# The Long-Term Benefits of Deep Work

Developing a deep work habit leads to numerous long-term benefits, including:

* **Increased Productivity**: You’ll get more done in less time, reducing the need for long work hours.
* **Higher-Quality Output**: Focused work results in better problem-solving and creative breakthroughs.
* **Career Advancement**: Mastering deep work can make you more valuable in any industry, as fewer people are capable of sustained focus.
* **Reduced Stress**: By avoiding constant distractions, your brain experiences less cognitive overload, leading to improved mental well-being.

# Final Thoughts

In a world filled with distractions, the ability to focus deeply is a rare and valuable skill. By understanding the science of deep work and applying these strategies, you can train your brain to stay concentrated, enhance your productivity, and achieve greater success in your professional and personal life. The key is consistency—small improvements in focus will compound over time, leading to significant gains. Start today, and unlock the full potential of deep work..
