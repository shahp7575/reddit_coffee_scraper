1ogj8t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ogj8t2/i_think_that_i_might_be_getting_stalked_and_i/,I think that I might be getting stalked and I don't know what to do,"So I'm a teenager, (I'm not going to say my specific age, but I'm under 18), and I know that will make people not believe me or think I'm just making this up or being paranoid, but I just genuinely don't know what to do.

So, the first time I thought I might was about a month ago. I was standing in my room which is on the second story in view of my window. I was distracted because I was playing a vidoe game, I glanced out my window and there was just a guy standing in the middle of the road staring directly into my window. And by the way, this was at around 11pm, so it's scared the hell out of me. As soon as I saw him I literally jumped out of view from my window, after I looked about a minute later he was completely gone and I didn't see any sign of him anywhere.

The second time was about a week ago. I was walking to school with one of my friends, and we were walking up this street. The opposite side of the street was mostly filled with parked cars, but there was this gap in the cars where there wasn't one, and in that gap there was a guy standing there. I don't know if this is necessary to include but where I live it's been super cold recently, and I didn't see him wearing a jacket, he also had a suitcase beside him. But about halfway up this street, I glanced at this guy and he was staring, like fully staring directly at us. I didn't say anything to my friend at first. We walked for a little more and he still was. We walked for a little more again and I looked again and he was still staring, he was watching us over a car, so I told my friend. She looked back and he was apparently standing in the middle of the road just staring at us, but I didn't see that. That freaked me out so bad, I was genuinely paranoid the entire day after that especially since I had to walk back home alone.

The third time was about 2 days ago, now this one might just be me overreacting but I don't know. I was sitting in my parents coffee shop at one of the windows on my phone, the way I was sitting was sort of sideways cause I had my feet on the stool opposite me (if you get what I mean), now my parents shop is in the middle of the city on one of the high streets, so it's busy and alot of people obviously walk past this window. But there was this one guy who walked past who was super weird. I was, as I said on my phone, but I glanced up and there was this guy walked past, just fully staring directly at me. Not into the store or at the menus on the window, directly at me. I was super freaked out, especially because he looked similar to the guy who was standing on the road from the 2nd time. After he had passed I sort of shrugged it off, and I had moved to the other side of the store. Then I saw him walk past AGAIN, super slowly and he was staring at me again. After that I never saw him again, and he wasn't a regular or anything, I know almost all of the regulars in our shop and I had never once seen this man before, so that only added to how much it freaked me out.

This might be irrelevant, but since this has started, specifically for the last few night I've had very vivid nightmares about people breaking into my house. This might not be related but I've never had dreams like this before and they're very scary.

Now I know that all of these could just absolutely be coincidences, and that honestly what I'm trying to say to myself to. I've always been a bit of a skeptic, and I keep trying to tell myself that I'm being crazy but I just don't think I am. I just want to say that I'm not a very socially anxious person, I'm never hyper aware of people or if they're looking at me, and I've never been a very paranoid person either. But lately I've been so paranoid that even going downstairs at night scares me.

I've told some of my friends, and they do believe me but I don't think they understand genuinely how afraid I am because of what's been happening.

I am seeking beta readers for Part One of my latest draft The Long-Forgotten Fortune of Molly Walsh. While the rough draft is complete, as I move through editing it, I would like to get feedback on this first part to see if I am on the right track before I get too far in.  

I am looking for feedback on character and plot set up. 

I have provided a blurb (also WIP) and the opening chapter below to see if you'd be interested in reading a contemporary mystery treasure hunt with a slow-burn romance and a *touch* of the supernatural.

I am not currently available for a critique swap. However, I am always open to speaking with potential writing partners (I don't currently have anyone consistent and it get's a bit lonely!) so if my excerpt resonates with you and you think we'd be a good fit, do reach out. :)

Thank you so much in advance.

  
**Blurb**

Stephen Hadley's on a quest to recover a long-lost family treasure, but so far it's not been the adventure he'd hoped. After a near-miss with the law, he's forced to partner with an unflappable tour-guide who knows far more about his ancestor than should be possible. Ignoring a distracting and extremely inconvenient fondness for his charismatic companion, Stephen realizes they're not the only ones looking for the loot across London, Belfast, Amsterdam and beyond. 

  
**Sample**

**Part I - London**

**Chapter One**

Stephen‚Äôs mother knew how to tell a story.

Typically, she chose the good living room as the venue for these tales, a room she called *the salon*, with the largest windows, a fireplace, and two couches facing each other. She'd light a stick of incense, mumbling something about cleansing, incomprehensible to the nine-year-old Stephen waiting impatiently for the story to begin. As always, it would revolve around his mother‚Äôs illustrious ancestry. Emphasis on the *ill.*

Fiona Hadley‚Äôs style drew you in without the need for surprises. In fact, she was so unconcerned with suspense, she often spoiled the conclusion to put her audience at ease.

‚ÄúNow, my darling,‚Äù she‚Äôd say, in her languid west coast drawl, snakes of fragrant smoke spiralling around her head, ‚Äúthis story doesn‚Äôt start out very nicely. But it gets better, I promise. There‚Äôs a happy ending.‚Äù

Right now, handcuffed to a chair in a security guard‚Äôs office in piss-stinking London, Stephen wished she were here to skip ahead. To tell him how in hell he gets out of this.

He would hardly call his actions trespassing, a word the security guard repeated with galling frequency. He simply wandered in through an unlocked door and, facing no obstacles, made his way to a room labelled ‚ÄòCollections.‚Äô At the time, he‚Äôd thought it was The Leadenhall Market Heritage Centre‚Äôs fault for failing to lock up properly. Granted, once he realized it was seven thirty in the morning and *not* the middle of the night, the unlocked door made a little more sense. And yes, he had been a little wasted.

Regardless of the details, his intention was to retrieve property belonging to *his* family, he had a right to see it. And he lived in the apartment above. That had to count for something.

The guard returned with a chipped mug of coffee and a newspaper under his arm. Now sobered up, Stephen stared at the steaming drink with unfiltered longing. His mouth was dry and foul-tasting, his brand new Huntsman three-piece suit was rumpled, and it was easy to imagine how god awful he looked from the shoulders up.¬†

Handcuffs seemed a little intense for a small, volunteer-run museum, forcing Stephen to assume they were the guard‚Äôs personal property. Oh God, this wasn‚Äôt some kind of kink, was it? He shook the cuffs against the armrest unsubtly under the guise of stretching, but his jailor didn‚Äôt look up, evidently engrossed in today‚Äôs crossword puzzle.

‚ÄúExcuse me, sir, but how long exactly do you plan to keep me here?‚Äù

The guard took a long, loud slurp of coffee before turning his eyes up. ‚ÄúThe manager‚Äôll be in soon enough. We‚Äôll deal with you together.‚Äù

‚ÄúListen, I told you, I was just trying to get upstairs. I lost my key to the door from the street, figured there might be a way through here.‚Äù

The two places did share a stairway, so the excuse wasn‚Äôt beyond the realms of possibility.¬†

‚ÄúYou can tell that to the manager when she gets here.‚Äù

Stephen had tried to get an appointment with this manager for the entire three weeks since moving into the apartment upstairs. It was she who‚Äôd taken most of the potentially significant items retrieved from said apartment, and locked them up in the very room he was caught trying to break into.

The bell above the front door to the Heritage Centre rang through the office.¬†

Clive kept his eyes on the crossword. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôll be herself, now.‚Äù

She slammed the door behind her, and loud footsteps moved towards them. ‚ÄúIf that bloody new shop across the road asks me one more bloody time about getting a bloody blue plaque on their‚Äì‚Äù

*Herself* entered, startled, all of five foot and seventy pounds of her, wearing a pair of wing shaped eyeglasses that would definitely be hot to Stephen in different circumstances.¬†

She eyed the handcuffs. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

The guard stood slowly to attention, a coffee stain on his light grey tie. *It‚Äôs not even nine am, man.*¬†

Myra Laithewaite‚Äôs gaze fixed on Stephen's left eye. In the strangeness of his morning, he‚Äôd totally forgotten he had a shiner. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not your handwork, is it Clive?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was in that state when I caught him rattling the collection room door ‚Äòbout half seven this morning.‚Äù

She was unmoved by Clive's account of the event. ‚ÄúAnd what do you expect me to do with him?‚Äù

‚ÄúMs. Laithewaite, my name‚Äôs Stephen Hadley, I‚Äôve been trying to contact you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmerican?‚Äù

Can just *one* Brit begin a conversation with something other than clarifying the glaringly obvious.¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. My ancestor, Molly Walsh, the diver, she lived in the apartment upstairs. The landlord found some documents after the most recent tenant left.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am aware Mr Hadley, they‚Äôre in our possession now. Another of Molly Walsh‚Äôs relatives had said we could keep whatever we wanted.‚Äù

Stephen‚Äôs cousin, who they had unfortunately contacted first, had no interest in their family's history, nor believed in any possibility of finding the long-rumored treasure within it. If they had called Stephen instead, none of this would have had to happen.¬†

‚ÄúWell my cousin spoke too soon, and I‚Äôd like to see them, I‚Äôm trying to dig up some information.‚Äù

‚ÄúFamily tree is it?‚Äù

That was most people‚Äôs assumption. And Stephen was happy for them to make it. ‚ÄúSomething like that.‚Äù

Anything that saved him from having to say *I‚Äôm looking for a fortune of gold bullion hidden by my great-great-great-great-great-great aunt over a century ago.*¬†

According to one of this mother‚Äôs stories, this *Stolen* bullion had cursed their entire family for generations.¬†

‚ÄúCall the police, Clive.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, look, I was just a little drunk, I didn‚Äôt have my outside key, so I stumbled through the office looking for another way to get upstairs.‚Äù Stephen attempted to gesticulate, to enamor the pair of them to his case, but being handcuffed, he banged the bones of his wrist painfully. He felt his own desperation struggling to keep his tone even.

If the cops got involved, he‚Äôd be back to the US, and his search for the gold would be over before it‚Äôd even begun.¬†

And if the search was over, that meant an entire chapter of his life was also over. The beautiful, transient, nomadic existence of the last eight years would finally turn into the inevitable.¬†

Permanency. A roster of set-ups at the country club. Viewings of homes in rural Connecticut, commutable to his father‚Äôs office in the City. He knew he‚Äôd end up there eventually: a cushy job, domestic bliss, Sundays on the links. But he wasn‚Äôt ready. He hadn‚Äôt even managed to learn to like golf yet.

‚ÄúCome on, don‚Äôt call the police. This was just a mistake, you‚Äôve got to believe me.‚Äù

Myra leaned for the phone on Clive‚Äôs desk. ‚ÄúWe have no idea you are who you say you are. What proof do you have of this ‚Äòancestry‚Äô you speak of?‚Äù

Proof was always tricky where Mary Margaret ‚ÄúMolly‚Äù Walsh was concerned. Chasing back through seven generations was hard enough, the past receding like a spot in Stephen‚Äôs vision. The matter was not helped by the fact that Molly never wrote a damn thing down in her life.

Myra Laithewaite was a historian. She would understand that, right? The enormity of his task.¬†

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know you from Adam,‚Äù she went on, crossing her arms.

there was someone who could vouch for him. It wasn‚Äôt solid proof, but it was worth trying.

He reached his free hand into his back pocket, an action that caused both Myra and Clive to flinch backwards, screeching the desk an inch across the floor. Stephen wasn‚Äôt what anyone would consider classically threatening, neither tall nor broad, and while he was rather *mena√ßant* on the fencing strip, they couldn‚Äôt know that. The black eye clearly held a power of its own.

‚ÄúHey, hey, it‚Äôs just paper, Jesus,‚Äù he said, trying and failing to unfold the flyer with one hand. ‚ÄúLook, email this woman. She knows about my family.‚Äù

Myra cautiously came closer to take the flier from him, and narrowed her eyes, regarding it with familiarity. ‚ÄúJade McGorry will vouch for you?‚Äù

Hearing Jade‚Äôs name spoken by someone else set Stephen‚Äôs pulse running. He hadn‚Äôt banked on having to see her again so soon.¬†

He can‚Äôt quite believe his fate somehow hangs on the word of a tour-guide he met days ago,¬†who somehow knew more about Molly Walsh than should be possible. A tour guide he had pissed off royally and who probably hated his guts.¬†

*They* didn‚Äôt need to be burdened with that detail.

‚ÄúYou know her?‚Äù

Clive relaxed a little after his near-death by paper-cut. He approached Stephen and unlocked the unnecessary cuffs.

‚ÄúWe know her,‚Äù adds Myra. ‚ÄúShe occasionally frequents our collections for research.‚Äù

Her respect for Jade was easy to discern. Which was irritating but also useful for Stephen‚Äôs current predicament.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôll vouch for me.‚Äù He held a minuscule hope that somewhere beneath Jade‚Äôs shiny veneer existed some mercy. She *had* seemed reasonable during their brief interactions.¬†

And, more crucially, he knew she was curious.¬†

People like Jade McGorry, who trace history, leaf through dusty old lists of names and obscured newspaper clippings, dig up pottery shards and unearth foundations, who pore over diaries and letters and UV-scorched photographs; they are powered by a need to know the unknowable.¬†

To find out how the story ends.¬†

Because history, like life, doesn‚Äôt have a narrator who knows all the answers. Who can ease your mind about where the tale is going.¬†

There's no one to tell you: *it gets better, I promise. There is a happy ending.*

You have to figure it out yourself. All the while aware there are no guarantees. Just a subjective interpretation of whatever scraps you‚Äôre lucky enough to find.

‚ÄúPlease, contact her. She‚Äôll tell you who I am, and verify my connection to Molly Walsh. And would you look at that,‚Äù he said, making a show of digging around his pocket, ‚Äúturns out I did have my key after all.‚Äù

Myra still looked skeptical, pushing those wing-shaped eyeglasses up her nose. It was a look that wondered, *do you get punched a lot?* But after a few drawn-out moments she nodded to Clive. He obediently picked up the phone while she retrieved a number from an address book.¬†

Stephen psyched himself up to say a phrase he‚Äôd spent most of his life avoiding. Perhaps the most detested combination of words in his repertoire.

‚ÄúCould you also ask if Jade can come by the market today?‚Äù

He clenched his fists. *Come on, man. It‚Äôs just five little words.*¬†

‚ÄúI really need her help.‚Äù

And Hecate just grins and goes ‚ÄúI give myself to Nobody‚Äù while Odysseus is just in the background undoing bonds from his wrists.

Realistically, future Mel knows the deal. She knows the young her was messing with three virgins and Eris. Hecate is a real boss, she doesn‚Äôt want some Asa Butterfield chump who can target ships but never the clitoris.

She wants a cut, smoking hot and well maintained middle aged man who spent 7 YEARS learning, out of desperate necessity, how to keep a goddess happy, not to mention his brief willing internship where he can guarantee how to keep a Witch happy, and who also has commitment issues so it never has to get real.

Our group had one member allergic to wheat, but not celiac, who could have soy sauce and had no problem with cross-contamination. Surprisingly a lot of the restaurants that had vegan options had clearly labelled gluten free options as well.

**Tokyo**

* Fucha Bon

Absolute highlight of our trip, we had the 6 course meal in a private tatami room. The ""unagi"" surprise course was to die for. Requires reservation, we managed to book like 2 weeks in advance.

* Lamb shabu shabu

Despite its name the chain offers a vegan certified shabu shabu experince, with is mushroom and soy meat based. Fun experience with lots of different types of mushrooms, felt worth it even though it was pricier (a lot of food, drinks were cheap). Our waitress made sure everything was vegan and everything went really great.

* Vegan bistro Jangara

Classic, but it really does work. Loved the garlic oil ramen.

* Izakaya Masaka

Filled with people every night for a reason. Salty food, great with some drinks. We also ordered food from the Kyoto branch location. Touristy, but hey, we were tourists. The karaage and mushrooms we're amazing, as well as the cucumbers.

* Cafe Tarot

Lovely restaurant, good food. Great for astrology fans, we liked it. And one has to have falafel at some point as vegan traveler. Nothing to do with the food, but has a great bathroom with good toilet paper (idk why toilet paper is so thin in most places).

* Sunday Vegan

The filled cream donut was amazing, and with it being near Inokashira Park and lots of second hand clothing stores I believe its a great place to grab something sweet to go.

* Marbre Vegan

Classic, great cake, good coffee. Not overtly sweet.

**Good, but not must gos:**

* Genuine gluten free where is a dog (Great for when you need vegan and gluten free food, simple but good, also has baked goods. Near the Ghibli museum.)
* Ain Soph (the foods alright but a pit pricey, we went to the Shinjuku location. The sweet potato pancakes we're a hit)
* Ts Tantan (great for lunch before taking a shinkansen, even some space for luggage)
* VEGAN GYOZA (salty, but I bet it would be great after a few lemon sours, I loved the outdoor dining possibility. No gluten free options.)
* 2foods vegetarian Ginza (easy fast food, if you want to try omurice, this spot is good for that)

We didn't get to go to Saido (only had availability for lunchtime and we didn't want that), or Mer \[vegan\], have to try to get tables if we visit again.

**Kyoto**

* Ms Bento

Surprisingly the tofu there is just as good as they advertise, the bento box set was really great and the tofu was a definite highlight.

* Hachidori table vegetarian food and coffee

Amazing little restaurant run by what I believe is a mother-daughter duo. The soy cutlets were amazing, highly recommend for simple, homemade but really great food.

* Silver backs cafe

A fun place, the host was so much fun. Only had chocolate parfaits and ice cream, but I would recommend, it was a fun experience and the parfait was really good.

We were here the shortest time, we didn't get to go to Toriba coffee Kyoto which came recommended to us. We did try the cake vending machine next to Gion Soy Milk ramen, fun experience but a bit pricey.

**Osaka**

* OKO Okonomiyaki and its sister restaurant OKO Takoyaki

Fun venues, CHEAP drinks, good local food. Personally not as much of a fan of the soft texture of the Okonomiyaki and Takoyaki, but our group really overall enjoyed the food. Worth going, if you don't mind queues and waiting since its a one woman show in both places.

* Green Earth

A classic lunch spot, really good basic food. Went multiple times.

* Canelita sweets

Great carrot cake, really moist! Definitely recommend for sweets lovers.

* Naki vegan sweets

A small place, with great cake, good coffee and lovely to-go options, bought the fall cookie tin.

* Ramen Kiou JR-Shin-Osaka station

A good busy lunch ramen spot with two or three vegan options on the menu. The vegan tonkotsu style ramen was salty, unbelievably creamy and good, despite being heavy for lunch. No gluten free options.

**Good, but not must gos:**

* MERCY Vegan factory (good if you want to have an egg sandwich or a fruit sandwich

Osaka was our least favorite food wise, maybe the local food scene didn't hit with us that well. Only bad experience was Pivot Base cafe with its undercooked gyoza and a hassle with a gluten free dish (arrived not gluten free). I'd still go if I was really hungry and in the area, but stay clear of the gyoza. We did hear some guests say they are visiting again due to how good the food is, so maybe our experience just wasn't the greatest.

Didn't get to go to Luu's Bao since it was closed when we were in town, but its on the bucket list for future visits for sure. Missed out on some other great places too, since we couldn't get tables at Shojin sushi Minamo or Gluten-Free&Vegan OKONOMIYAKI Vim.

**Konbini and grocery stores**

Harder, scanning for contents was frustrating with everything having fish, chicken, beef, or milk in them. Went to some organic grocery stores which had options and stocked up on Ts Tan Tan noodles and snacks. Konbinis did provide coffee and even the smallest locations had almond or soy milk available. Some rice balls are vegan, but the wast majority of them not despite the content lists (fish isn't considered an allergen). Used google translate that translated by taking a picture of an item, it mostly worked great.

Bigger grocery stores had more options, with yogurts, flavored soy milks (not all are vegan, best check) and of course fruits.

**Overall:**

 We had really amazing food overall, there were some places not mentioned on this list. Going to mostly vegan only places really helped us feel comfortable. We also are food motivated, so we went our way to walk and travel to different restaurants. I'd also say being in Japan and seeing how animals are treated was a bit jarring, with the animal cafes, animals being sold in stores and everyone dressing up their dogs despite how warm it was... Not great.

I'd say being vegan in japan as a tourist wasn't as hard as people make it out to be, though the options are more limited and you have to do a bit of research and more traveling if you want to experience different restaurants. It of course would be harder in smaller cities, but with the bigger cities we stayed in, there were multiple options. Happy cow is great in a pinch. I'd also recommend creating google maps lists in advance, we did that with more than a hundred places saved, really saved us from being too hangry. We did have too many curries though, I don't want one for a while lol.",3,1761480524.0,veganinjapan,0,0.8,False

They told me when I became an adult I‚Äôd meet up with my friends every day and we would spend more time together than we would at work. We would live next door or a couple blocks away. There might be a quaint little coffee shop nearby where we would refuel our energy and spill all of the tea. I was supposed to get to live down the road from my parents and have weekly dinners with them. I was supposed to be the aunt who was always there. Every school play. Every birthday party. Every sporting event. I was supposed to watch them grow day by day. 

Instead I may catch a birthday party here or a dedication there. We get together around each major holidays but there‚Äôs so much catching up to do we aren‚Äôt ever caught up. I feel like my home exploded and blew me 200 miles west and my brother 60 miles south and my parents 85 miles north. I feel like if I had headed east instead of west my entire life would be different. I‚Äôve learned that  sometimes the right turn is the wrong one and that sometimes the left turn forces you to leave behind the ones who you desperately want to take with you. 

Suddenly support is words on a screen instead of face to face connections. Love is a card in the mail saying that you‚Äôre missed or the ending of an all-too-short phone call. Friendship is loving a post on Facebook showing how much the little ones made by your closest friends have grown and wondering where the hell did the time go. 

What I miss the most isn‚Äôt the big events we would attend together or the dinners out and the movies we watched. I miss the quiet moments. I miss when we would share our hearts, our joy, our sorrow and our struggles and then sit comfortably in the silence of being understood. It‚Äôs the words that don‚Äôt need to be spoken and when breathing the same air is the only thing keeping us from breaking. 

I always leave with something I should have said. There is always a story I didn‚Äôt tell or a question I forgot to ask. Every day that passes feels shorter than the one before it. They blur into weeks and then years and suddenly a decade has passed when you could swear it was just yesterday. How is possible that I am both 30 and 17 at the same time? 

I will obsess and retrace every step I took wondering if maybe I could have just changed one small seemingly insignificant thing that would make everything the same as it is but put me closer to my friends and family. However nothing is insignificant. One step in an alternate direction would have lead me to an entirely different life. I can‚Äôt imagine my life any other way. In so many ways my life is perfectly flawed and honest, disastrous and real. 

It‚Äôs insomnia poems that might not make sense anymore when I read them in the morning. It‚Äôs a painting that is a mess when I‚Äôm standing up close but that‚Äôs beautiful when I take a step back. It‚Äôs laying in bed hearing the snores of the ones I love. My dog, my cats and of course my husband. It‚Äôs casting a line out on the lake and hooking a fish before I can even set my pole down. It‚Äôs watching the sun set on the water as the blues turn into oranges and pinks and yellows. It‚Äôs stopping in the middle of the yard to take a deep breath and a good look around at the gorgeous house that I get to call home. 

It‚Äôs laying my head down at night and thanking God for the today I was blessed with and the tomorrow I hope to wake up to.

I simply needed something cheap and fashionable. Then a friend who is a carpenter/upholster showed me a Fir wood furniture he wanted to sell. It was quite strong but not heavy so it can be placed in small areas, this is what makes it ideal for a person who has to move furniture as  frequently as I do.

I bought the  Fir wood desk and a set of chairs and the natural grain was immediately apparent. My workspace feels more natural and mentally more comfortable for me. I later found out online that Fir wood is also favored as it is sustainable and does not decay easily, and that is why most minimalist setups use it to decorate their place.

As I continued my search, I found a couple of Fir pieces on Alibaba, then Etsy, even eBay had people, mostly artisans trying to sell the ones they  handcrafted. A great idea for those looking to customize their space.

And now I am even thinking of replacing my small coffee table with another Fir. It has been worth it just because of its durability. I would like to see how it stands the test of time.",1,1761480382.0,interiordesignideas,0,1.0,False

1ogixyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimMarriage/comments/1ogixyd/toxic_and_controlling_sil/,Toxic and controlling SIL,"My husbands brother got married last year. He was engaged for 2 years before that. He met his wife just when my husband and I got married. 

Ever since she entered our family our relationship with my brother in law got worse. 
It started very early on when my husband and his brother had a small argument which they usually would get over with but my BIL didn‚Äôt talk to us for 3 weeks. 
He didn‚Äôt answer our calls, didn‚Äôt come to any pre-wedding events we had and my husband was obviously very sad about this. He decided to text his girlfriend (whom we didn‚Äôt even meet yet) just to ask why his brother is acting like this, what happened and if she could help. 

Well the answer she gave us should‚Äôve told us everything: she said because of the argument my husband and his brother had, THEY decided to distance themselves from us. Like what??? 

Looking back now it should‚Äôve been a warning sign but she is extremely manipulating to the point you‚Äôre questioning yourself. 

Ever since their engagement, she takes all of the money from my BIL and only gives him a weekly allowance. Often times he calls us and asks for money for eg gas. My in laws get extremely mad but they don‚Äôt want to get involved between husband and wife. 

Before their wedding my BIL stayed in a one bedroom apartment and one time he called me crying and told me that his wife regularly gets aggressive, kicks him, scratches him and yells at him. He showed me that his fridge was empty and he only had pasta to eat, she wouldn‚Äôt give buy him anything else to ‚Äúsave for the wedding‚Äù. Meanwhile she went on vacations with her friends 

My BIL and my MIL agreed before the wedding that my BIL would save 10k until the wedding and my MIL would pay the other 10k. 3 weeks before the wedding his wife calls my MIL and says the money is not there he doesn‚Äôt have any money we needed to spent it on wedding dress, decoration etc. my MIL almost fainted bc she panicked since the wedding was in 3 weeks and she didn‚Äôt have the money. On their wedding day there was an announcement that there was a gift from the husband to the wife and it was a gold jewelry set easily worth 8-10k. My BIL didn‚Äôt know about this. So she took the 10k he saved to buy herself gold. 

She is also a compulsive liar and we‚Äôve caught her lies a lot. I used to have a very close relationship with my BIL we were like siblings but since he got married he doesn‚Äôt call me, doesn‚Äôt pick up, doesn‚Äôt visit us. I tried building a relationship with his wife, bought her presents, prepared a birthday surprise for her and regularly met her for coffee. But it‚Äôs impossible to build a bond bc she keeps lying and lying. Especially to me because she wants to compare herself/her marriage to ours. When I say I did XYZ with my husband she says she did the same with BIL. When I ask my BIL about this he denies it. When I say I went to XY place with my parents for vacation she says she also went there with her parents. It‚Äôs so annoying and I can‚Äôt build a friendship based on that. 

Now the situation has escalated. My husband had a very important match last weekend and they didn‚Äôt come. When asked about this she said she was still on vacation with her friends - which was a lie because we knew she arrived a day earlier. She wanted to visit her own parents on that day so they went there - which nobody would care if she just told us so. We would understand. We didn‚Äôt say anything my husband just texted his brother insallah you are there for my next match. 

Well, next match came - and everybody was there, cousins, friends, colleagues but not my BIL. My father in law got so mad he called him and asked where he was and he said they are sick and can‚Äôt come. We all immediately knew it was a lie from his wife. Later on someone saw them having coffee in the city. 
My husband was so sad because he wanted his brother to be there for support. 
He confronted his wife and told her to stop lying she of course denied it and turned it around to say ‚Äúwhy are you doubting us‚Äù. My BIL defended her and told us not to make a scene. 

While she was on vacation my BIL was his old self. He called us, visited us, we played games all together. Once she came back it stopped. 

But we just don‚Äôt know how to handle it. We don‚Äôt care about her at this point but just want him to SEE it and understand what she‚Äôs doing. Whenever there‚Äôs an event in her family they immediately go there. When it comes to us only excuses. We didn‚Äôt do anything, my in laws are the most understanding people I know so we don‚Äôt understand. We are a very close knit family so we just want my BIL to at least see how she pulls him away.  

What should we do? When we confront him we just push him more towards her. When we don‚Äôt say anything she just keeps lying.

Instead I may catch a birthday party here or a dedication there. We get together around each major holidays but there‚Äôs so much catching up to do we aren‚Äôt ever caught up. I feel like my home exploded and blew me 200 miles west and my brother 60 miles south and my parents 85 miles north. I feel like if I had headed east instead of west my entire life would be different. I‚Äôve learned that  sometimes the right turn is the wrong one and that sometimes the left turn forces you to leave behind the ones who you desperately want to take with you. 

Suddenly support is words on a screen instead of face to face connections. Love is a card in the mail saying that you‚Äôre missed or the ending of an all-too-short phone call. Friendship is loving a post on Facebook showing how much the little ones made by your closest friends have grown and wondering where the hell did the time go. 

What I miss the most isn‚Äôt the big events we would attend together or the dinners out and the movies we watched. I miss the quiet moments. I miss when we would share our hearts, our joy, our sorrow and our struggles and then sit comfortably in the silence of being understood. It‚Äôs the words that don‚Äôt need to be spoken and when breathing the same air is the only thing keeping us from breaking. 

I always leave with something I should have said. There is always a story I didn‚Äôt tell or a question I forgot to ask. Every day that passes feels shorter than the one before it. They blur into weeks and then years and suddenly a decade has passed when you could swear it was just yesterday. How is possible that I am both 30 and 17 at the same time? 

I will obsess and retrace every step I took wondering if maybe I could have just changed one small seemingly insignificant thing that would make everything the same as it is but put me closer to my friends and family. However nothing is insignificant. One step in an alternate direction would have lead me to an entirely different life. I can‚Äôt imagine my life any other way. In so many ways my life is perfectly flawed and honest, disastrous and real. 

It‚Äôs insomnia poems that might not make sense anymore when I read them in the morning. It‚Äôs a painting that is a mess when I‚Äôm standing up close but that‚Äôs beautiful when I take a step back. It‚Äôs laying in bed hearing the snores of the ones I love. My dog, my cats and of course my husband. It‚Äôs casting a line out on the lake and hooking a fish before I can even set my pole down. It‚Äôs watching the sun set on the water as the blues turn into oranges and pinks and yellows. It‚Äôs stopping in the middle of the yard to take a deep breath and a good look around at the gorgeous house that I get to call home. 

It‚Äôs laying my head down at night and thanking God for the today I was blessed with and the tomorrow I hope to wake up to.

[US President Donald Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim after signing a critical minerals deal in Kuala Lumpur on Oct 26.PHOTO: AFP](https://preview.redd.it/fmw8nt4rjfxf1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=966c4f31c98310f83578505a94401861c29d377e)

KUALA LUMPUR¬†‚Äì¬†Malaysia inked a trade deal with the United States with President Donald Trump in attendance at the sidelines of the 47th Asean Summit on Oct 26, locking in a 19 per cent tariff rate that was agreed back in August.

The deal included several concessions made by Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim‚Äôs administration, including in the supply of critical minerals to America, a key plank of ongoing trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing that centres on curbs of advanced technology supply chains.

US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the agreement ensures that trade investment in critical minerals between both sides ‚Äúcan be as free as possible and as resilient as possible‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe live in a world where having these critical minerals is important to our manufacturing, to our technology and to our economy. It is very important that we cooperate as willing partners with each other to ensure that we can have smooth supply chains.‚Äù

The 19 per cent tariff, however, will not affect about 60 per cent of Malaysia‚Äôs RM200 billion (S$61 billion) of exports to the US such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, which are currently zero-rated by Washington.

A joint statement on their ‚Äúagreement on reciprocal trade‚Äù confirmed an¬†[ST report in July that Kuala Lumpur is conceding on several issues](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/us-malaysia-tariff-deal-expected-after-trump-anwar-phone-call-on-eve-of-aug-1-deadline?ref=inline-article)¬†‚Äì such as recognising American halal certification and the supply of rare earths, a critical mineral used in advanced technological applications ‚Äì to bring down the initial 25 per cent tariff.

‚ÄúMalaysia has committed to refrain from banning, or imposing quotas on, exports to the United States of critical minerals or rare earth elements,‚Äù said the memorandum of understanding on the issue of critical minerals.

Under the memorandum, Malaysia will ensure no restrictions are placed on the sale of rare earth magnets to American companies.

Malaysia has also pledged to expedite the development of its critical minerals and rare earths sectors in partnership with US firms, including granting extended operating licences to create business certainty for increased production capacity.

Malaysia has rare earth deposits of more than 16 million tonnes that are worth an estimated RM1 trillion. It currently supplies around 13 per cent of the global demand for critical minerals, a figure that includes rare earths. Rare earth ore mined in Malaysia is currently exported to China as Malaysia lacks the requisite technology to process it.

Washington has made the pursuit of rare earths a key component of its national security strategy, as China dominates their production and has used this to its advantage in responding to the trade war initiated by Mr Trump.

Rare earths are used in a wide range of technological equipment from mobile phones and power generators to defence technology.

Since trade negotiations between Malaysia and the US kicked off in April, Malaysia has already increased its purchase of American gas and tightened controls on ‚Äúorigin washing‚Äù and movement of artificial intelligence chips ‚Äì curbs aimed at clamping down on Chinese evasion of trade sanctions.

However, Datuk Seri Anwar has said that interference with national economic policies such as the longstanding and politically sensitive equity quotas for bumiputeras ‚Äì a term used to collectively refer to its Malay majority and indigenous tribes ‚Äì was a ‚Äúred line‚Äù.

Almost eight years to the day after the last Holden rolled off an Adelaide factory assembly line,¬†[Anthony Albanese](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/anthony-albanese)¬†announced a $13bn deal with Donald Trump to help champion a domestic rare-earth industry.

[Announcing the deal](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/20/albanese-at-the-white-house-trump-endorses-aukus-signs-85bn-rare-earths-deal-and-calls-pm-great-leader)¬†this week in Washington, the prime minister called it ‚Äúa really significant day‚Äù that would take the relationship between the two countries ‚Äúto the next level‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just getting started,‚Äù Albanese said.

The US president claimed ‚Äúin about a year from now, we‚Äôll have so much critical mineral and rare earths, that you won‚Äôt know what to do with them‚Äù.

Most Australians, it‚Äôs fair to say, would already struggle to know what to do with a kilo of gallium, for example, let alone a bucket of neodymium-praseodymium oxide.

But both are among a wide range of elements and related products that are essential to advanced manufacturing, consumer electronics, modern militaries and the clean energy transition.

Rare earths are present in electric vehicles and modern batteries, solar panels and wind turbines, electronic devices like iPhones, and in defence hardware ‚Äì from missile guidance systems to submarines.

Turns out, we are all carrying around rare earths in our pockets.

# Industry policy is back in vogue

The timing of this week‚Äôs critical minerals deal with the anniversary of the last Aussie-made Holden is particularly poignant because it shows how much the world has shifted.

Where once free trade ruled and cost-competitiveness trumped all other considerations ‚Äì often to the detriment of workers and the environment ‚Äì we are now in a more fragmented world where countries and companies increasingly value¬†[security and reliability of supply](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/22/albaneses-critical-minerals-deal-isnt-good-economics-but-in-trump-and-xis-new-world-bargaining-chips-matter).

Australia is already an established miner of key critical minerals, including lithium, manganese, nickel-cobalt, rare earths and titanium.

Analysis by the Department of Industry, Science and Resources suggests we have ‚Äúconsiderable potential in established critical mineral markets like lithium, manganese, and heavy mineral sands, as well as emerging minerals such as rare earths and high purity silica‚Äù.

Our critical minerals exports could rise to more than $19bn by the end of the decade, in today‚Äôs dollars, versus a predicted $80bn for iron ore, according to DISR‚Äôs office of the chief economist.

But the department believes this potential has been stymied as producers here and overseas struggle to attract investment and maintain profits in markets dominated by a single player (that is, China) that has used its muscle to crash prices and send competitors out of business.

# It‚Äôs geopolitics, stupid

[Breaking China‚Äôs near monopoly](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/07/china-has-a-stranglehold-on-the-worlds-rare-earths-supply-chain-can-australia-break-it)¬†in global critical minerals markets and becoming a more valuable partner to the US are the driving forces behind this week‚Äôs deal between Albanese and Trump.

As Kevin Rudd, ambassador to the US, recently told a conference in Washington DC, Australia‚Äôs efforts in this space are about ‚Äúproviding long-term security of supply to the free world‚Äù.

But, Rudd said, that had to be matched by buyers prepared to look past ‚Äúthe lowest price on available markets‚Äù in return for a secure and reliable supply of critical minerals.

And it will take a lot of patience, commitment, time and money if Australia and other countries are to meaningfully close the gap with China, which now has a multidecade head start across a range of rare-earth elements and associated products.

China‚Äôs chokehold on world supply is shown in the stats: the communist country accounts for roughly 70% of rare-earth mining globally, and 90% of rare-earth processing.

That was an acceptable situation for western countries for a long time, as they were happy to buy cheap products they weren‚Äôt prepared to mine and make themselves.

But a more assertive China more recently has shown itself willing to use this dominance as a trade weapon, alarming politicians in Washington, particularly in the wake of Trump‚Äôs sweeping ‚Äúliberation day‚Äù tariffs.

The suspension of Chinese rare-earth exports in June forced carmaker Ford to pause its production line in Chicago. More recently, China has restricted the export of rare-earth magnets, which are used heavily by the US defence industry.

Luke Yeaman, the CBA chief economist, says the geopolitical reality now demands ‚Äúvery heavy-handed and large scale intervention from the US, Australia and a range of other countries to break the dominance of China‚Äù in critical minerals.

In the wake of Covid, Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine and China‚Äôs more assertive approach in global markets, Yeaman says ‚Äúcountries have realised that they can‚Äôt afford to maintain such concentrated supply chains in any country, but especially not in China‚Äù.

That means there is ‚Äúa strong economic imperative‚Äù to back a domestic rare-earth industry.

‚ÄúThe market is clearly too concentrated, without sufficient competition and without sufficient diversification.‚Äù

# Paper profits today

While Australia may have to wait a decade or more before seeing the fruits of today‚Äôs investments in rare earths, shareholders in miners are enjoying a massive jump in paper profits.

ASX-listed rare-earth mining shares have tripled in price this year alone as government announcements have sent stock values soaring.

One of the first projects to receive a major investment as part of this week‚Äôs deal is to develop Alcoa‚Äôs project in Western Australia, which in 2026 will produce gallium, where China accounts for 98% of global supply.

The Australian government also announced a $100m equity stake in Arafura‚Äôs Nolans neodymium-praseodymium oxide project, which is 135km north of Alice Springs and already has $1.2bn in taxpayer-funded support.

Arafura in 2032 hopes to supply 4% of the world‚Äôs NdPr oxide needs, which is used in the production of advanced magnets.

For context, China produces 93% of these rare-earth magnets.

# The world begins to catch up with China

As is often pointed out, rare earths are not actually rare, geologically speaking. But no country has invested as heavily in exploiting these resources as China.

China‚Äôs rare-earth industry dominates global supply and is the envy of the western world ‚Äì at least in its productive capacity, if not its environmental record, says Susan Park, a professor of global governance at the University of Sydney.

Park notes that the US had invested in rare earths in the 1950s and 60s, but there was little money in it, so the industry was left to languish.

China from the early 90s began investing heavily in rare earths, in a strategy that extended beyond extraction and into refining, which at the time suited western countries.

‚ÄúBecause of the significant environmental impacts, a lot of other countries were willing to let China do that,‚Äù Park says.

‚ÄúSo China, in many cases, said, we‚Äôre doing the right thing, we‚Äôre helping decarbonisation and we‚Äôre bearing the environmental costs of doing so. And then they get this backlash.‚Äù

As Australia chases the dream of becoming a ‚Äúglobal rare-earths superpower‚Äù, it will also need to grapple with the fact that many of these processes are heavily polluting, and in some cases, radioactive.

# A critical minerals industry for Australians

Robert Walker, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute, says it will probably not be until the 2030s that a fully functioning and transparent market for critical minerals emerges.

During that time, governments will need to act as guaranteed buyers and likely offer a minimum price to make the projects sustainable.

‚ÄúThe long-term projections are for demand to really keep increasing at speed, and therefore a lot of these projects need the kind of industrial subsidies and state support in the next few years to remain viable.‚Äù

This year‚Äôs spike in stock prices has raised concerns that taxpayer money will be funnelled into lining shareholder pockets, and that whatever deals are entered into must deliver a return to Australia.

The fact that 80% of Australia‚Äôs mining industry is foreign-owned further raises the stakes for policymakers when fashioning multibillion-dollar support packages.

Park, like Walker, backs a more ambitious approach than just creating another ‚Äúdig and ship‚Äù industry.

‚ÄúWe need a full industrial strategy that really looks at the whole supply chain, not just the minerals, but refining and processing, through to a product,‚Äù she says.

‚ÄúWe totally missed the boat on solar panels. We designed solar panels here in Australia, and they couldn‚Äôt get investment, so they went to China, and China now dominates the solar panel industry.""

[In US tariff talks, Brazil's rare earths a 'trump card' | Macau Business](https://www.macaubusiness.com/in-us-tariff-talks-brazils-rare-earths-a-trump-card/)

[\\""The quiet Giant\\""\~ Niobium = NioCorp! A U.S. secure, strategic supply \(pending finance\)](https://reddit.com/link/1ogit2v/video/pxttf5p4mfxf1/player)

**Brazil holds a trump card in tariff negotiations with the United States: its subsoil is rich in rare earth minerals coveted by manufacturers in a sector dominated by China.**

The South American giant holds the world‚Äôs second-largest reserves of these elements used in everything from electric vehicles, solar panels and smart phones to jet engines and guided missiles.

**China, a US rival which like Brazil is in a tariff standoff with President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration, holds a near-monopoly on rare earths production.**

And for Brazil‚Äôs Minister of Mines and Energy, Alexandre Silveira, there is ‚Äúa convergence of interests between our mineral potential and American capital.‚Äù

The issue could feature at a possible meeting this weekend between Trump and Brazil‚Äôs leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on the sidelines of a summit of Southeast Asian nations (ASEAN) in Kuala Lumpur.

Lula himself said Friday he was willing to ‚Äútalk about everything‚Äù with Trump, ‚Äúfrom Gaza to Ukraine, Russia, Venezuela, critical minerals, rare earths.‚Äù

Brazil is subject to a punitive 50-percent tariff on certain exports to the United States over the coup trial of Lula‚Äôs rightwing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro in what Trump has labeled a ‚Äúwitch hunt.‚Äù

Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years in prison last month.

**‚Äì ‚ÄòGeopolitical leverage‚Äô ‚Äì**

Rare earths are a group of 17 heavy metals considered so critical that it gives them ‚Äúgeopolitical leverage,‚Äù according to Gilberto Fernandes de Sa, founder of the rare earth laboratory at the Federal University of Pernambuco in northeastern Brazil.

China possesses about half of the world‚Äôs reserves, approximately 44 million metric tons (about 48 million US tons), and Brazil about 21 million, according to the United States Geological Survey.

China is also a leader in rare earths extraction and refining.

Earlier this month, Beijing announced restrictions on rare earths technology exports, and Washington signed a deal with Australia for access to its vast reserves ‚Äî the fourth largest in the world.

The United States has planned negotiations on the topic with China in Kuala Lumpur.

**‚Äì ‚ÄòWindow of opportunity‚Äô ‚Äì**

The distrust between Beijing and Washington presents ‚Äúa great window of opportunity‚Äù for Brazil, according to the minister, Silveira.

‚ÄúIt is American companies that invest the most in rare earths in Brazil,‚Äù he added.

But Fernandes de Sa said this was mostly extraction, and none of these companies were developing more sophisticated downstream operations in Brazil, such as mineral separation or magnet manufacturing.

He said Brazil would rather benefit from forming partnerships with China in the rare earths sector: ‚Äúthey are the ones with experience in this field.‚Äù

China is already Brazil‚Äôs largest trading partner, investing heavily in the South American giant‚Äôs automotive sector.

But any rapprochement between Beijing and Brasilia ‚Äî both members of the BRICS group of emerging economies ‚Äî is sure to raise the ire of Trump.

Before President Trump, America spent years wringing our collective hands about China and rare earths.¬† Now, with President Trump‚Äôs turbocharging of the Defense Production Act and other tools in the federal toolbox, we are taking action not seen since the Korean War to reduce our dependence on foreign critical minerals.

But while the focus in recent months has been largely on Beijing, another vulnerability has emerged on the near-term radar screen: niobium from Brazil.

Niobium is a little-known but irreplaceable metal. Added in small amounts to steel, it dramatically increases strength and durability while cutting weight‚Äîcritical for pipelines, bridges, turbines, and automobiles.¬† Virtually every steel-chassis vehicle on the planet contains niobium.¬† That‚Äôs not surprising given that one pound of niobium added to one ton of steel doubles the steel‚Äôs yield strength.¬†[**(RELATED: Trump Admin Looks To Pour Cash Into Critical Minerals To Break China‚Äôs Stranglehold)**](https://dailycaller.com/2025/08/13/trump-admin-pour-cash-critical-minerals-break-chinas-stranglehold/)

In aerospace and defense, niobium enables jet engines and hypersonic missiles to withstand extreme temperatures.¬† It is vital to every Navy ship and submarine that sails, and every fighter jet and commercial airliner that flies.¬† It is crucial to the superconducting magnets in MRI scanners and particle accelerators.

The U.S. consumes thousands of tons each year and imports 100 percent of it, overwhelmingly from Brazil.¬† That gives Brazilian President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva a card to play that rivals the rare earth card Chinese President Xi recently laid on the table.¬† Except, in the case of niobium, the stakes are even higher for the U.S.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)¬†*Mineral Commodity Summaries 2025*, Brazil accounted for about 66% of U.S. ferroniobium and niobium metal imports in 2024, with Canada supplying roughly 27‚Äì29%. But Canadian supply does not fully insulate the U.S. from Brazilian dominance; Canada has relied, in part, on Brazilian ores or concentrates as recently as 2023, according to international trade data.

As Fox News has reported extensively, China has imposed export restrictions on rare earths as leverage in geopolitical disputes. President Xi Jinping has made clear that Beijing views critical-mineral dominance as a strategic weapon, not just an economic advantage.

It is not hard to imagine President Lula doing the same.¬† He continues to align Brazil more closely with China and Russia. He bristles at U.S. trade policies, agricultural disputes, and climate disagreements. In a worsening relationship, niobium could become Lula‚Äôs pressure point, just as rare earths are for Xi.

Here is the uncomfortable truth: a Brazilian cutoff of niobium would be even more damaging to the U.S. economy and our national security than a Chinese cutoff of rare earths. Rare earths are critical for magnets, electronics, and many systems fielded by the Pentagon.¬† Niobium, by contrast, is less replaceable and more foundational. Without it, the strength and performance of steel and superalloys collapse‚Äîthreatening core sectors from construction to defense.

A new USGS analysis estimates that a disruption of Brazilian niobium exports to the U.S. could wipe away more than $10.4 billion per year from our GDP. While USGS assigns a relatively low 3.7% probability that Brazilian exports could be disrupted, it forecasts catastrophic impacts. Even a low-probability risk becomes urgent when the downside is so severe.

# The U.S. has virtually no margin of safety. There are only limited supplies of niobium in the National Defense Stockpile.

Recycling is negligible. Substitutes for many applications are expensive or inadequate. If Brazil acts, manufacturers will face soaring prices and crippling delays. Aircraft could be grounded, shipbuilding slowed, infrastructure compromised, and defense readiness undermined. The $10 billion/year GDP hit modeled by USGS is only the opening shock.

The U.S. has limited niobium resources considered economic for extraction except in one state:¬† Nebraska.¬† As America‚Äôs only primary niobium prospect, the Elk Creek Project will significantly alter the niobium risk equation and provide a partial solution.¬† (Full disclosure: I serve as the Chairman and CEO of NioCorp Developments, which is developing this project).

Once operational, Elk Creek could produce roughly 7,400 tons of ferroniobium annually for nearly four decades.¬† That is equivalent to 4,800 tonnes/year of contained niobium, over one-half of total U.S. apparent consumption of 8,400 tonnes.¬† This single U.S. mine would provide much-needed balance in the niobium supply chain and put a big dent in our import dependence.

**Besides getting this initial mine operational as fast as possible, how else can the U.S. dull Brazil‚Äôs niobium sword of Damocles?¬† There are only three operational niobium mines in the world today.¬† Two are in Brazil, and a smaller mine operates in Canada.¬† Guess which nation owns 100% of one of the Brazilian mines and holds an equity position in the second?¬† China.**

**The only real solution for niobium mirrors what the Trump Administration is doing for rare earths: mine, baby, mine.**

**The U.S. has already learned hard lessons about overreliance on adversarial suppliers. We cannot afford to repeat them with niobium. The USGS has quantified the risk. The geopolitics are clear. America must not wait for the day when a phone call from Bras√≠lia delivers an ultimatum.**

*Mark A. Smith is CEO and Chairman of NioCorp Developments Ltd., which is developing the Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project in Nebraska, designed to produce niobium, scandium, titanium, and rare earth oxides.*

# Critical Minerals ARE National Security Priority #1 ‚Äî and NioCorp‚Äôs Elk Creek Project in Nebraska is one U.S. project positioned to answer the call!

Brazil has suddenly realized its leverage over the United States: **niobium**. China controls most **rare earths**. And BOTH nations are signaling they‚Äôre ready to use these minerals as **geopolitical weapons**. The U.S. is exposed ‚Äî badly. üáßüá∑ dominates **66%** of America‚Äôs niobium imports‚Ä¶ and niobium is **structural sovereignty**: hypersonics, Navy ships, fighter jets, superconducting systems. Without it? Our aerospace, defense, and critical infrastructure take a direct hit.

That‚Äôs why multiple U.S. agencies ‚Äî from DoD to DOE to USGS ‚Äî are now openly warning that **America‚Äôs vulnerability to niobium and rare earth cutoffs** is unacceptable. And it‚Äôs why NioCorp stands out: it‚Äôs the **only U.S. primary source** positioned to produce **niobium, scandium, titanium AND magnet rare earths** ‚Äî all in the Top 10 on the U.S. 2025 Critical Mineral List. One project‚Ä¶ delivering solutions to **four national-security chokepoints**.

NioCorp isn‚Äôt just mining ‚Äî it‚Äôs **verticalizing the defense supply chain**. Lockheed Martin is now engaged on **Scandium-based aerospace alloys**. IBC and U.S. aluminum partners are positioning for **DFARS-certified Sc-Al production**. And the U.S. government is leaning heavily toward mine-to-metal-to-weapons manufacturing **on U.S. soil**. Elk Creek is the centerpiece of the new **hypersonic industrial base** ‚Äî and America needs it yesterday.

**üìå Bottom line:**

The geopolitics are shifting fast. Brazil knows its leverage. China is tightening its grip. And the United States finally has a domestic answer ready to build.  
üëâ **NioCorp = U.S. Scandium + Niobium + Titanium + Rare Earths**  
üëâ **The mineral foundation of aerospace dominance and quantum-era technologies**

*With ""MORE"" drill results expected in the near term, a live RedChip webinar set for tomorrow Oct. 27th, 2025, and potential offtake and financing agreements in play, NioCorp sits on the cusp of a major re-rating. As the only U.S. project capable of delivering*¬†***Scandium, Niobium, Titanium, and rare earths at scale***¬†*‚Äî and uniquely poised to dominate scandium-aluminum alloys ‚Äî Elk Creek could redefine American resource independence by 2028-2029 and beyond, cementing NioCorp as the flagship U.S. critical minerals solution!*

# ‚Äî and it‚Äôs clear: NioCorp isn‚Äôt just about magnets. It‚Äôs part of the U.S. Critical Minerals Solution!

# ‚Äî A game-changer for American Resource Independence by 2028/29 and beyond.

# NioCorp = ""The¬†Flagship U.S. source¬†for multiple Critical Minerals!‚Äù

For years, I thought my problem was that I just ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt good with people.‚Äù I‚Äôd overthink every word I said, replay conversations in my head, and avoid even small interactions like ordering coffee or making a phone call.

A few months ago, I started reading and reflecting a lot about where this fear actually comes from. One idea really hit me: that social anxiety isn‚Äôt about other people judging you ‚Äî it‚Äôs about *you judging yourself first.*

Since then, I‚Äôve been slowly trying small changes ‚Äî grounding myself before social situations, noticing when I start that ‚Äúmental self-commentary,‚Äù and letting it go. It‚Äôs not some miracle cure (I know those don‚Äôt exist), but it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôm making real progress.

1ogiqtf,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1ogiqtf/i_need_advices_about_a_situation/,i need advices about a situation,"It‚Äôs been a couple of days since I met a guy during a study trip. He and I immediately got along and joked a lot about everything. The last four days were when I started to feel something between us. One of those days we spent together with the others at the beach and at a sushi restaurant, where he had never been before ‚Äî he even asked me for advice. At the beach, he made everyone wait 10 minutes just so I could get my swimsuit, which another guy had borrowed.

One day, while we were coming back from a group outing, he and I fell behind to talk alone about relationships and dating. He told me about a girl he used to talk to and how things ended between them. I listened and gave him my opinion. Then we started talking about homosexuality, and he said he supports it and isn‚Äôt homophobic.

When we got back home, we went to sleep, and the next day he called me to see if I was running late. That day we spent time joking and playing together on the school‚Äôs sports field with the others. We ate in the same place and kept teasing each other. Then he asked me, away from everyone else, to come with him to find a bathroom, so we were alone for a while. We talked about how some people on this trip wanted to start relationships or just hook up, and we agreed that things should go slowly and not be rushed. We stayed alone a bit longer, then took a short walk to rejoin the others.

That evening, we all went out together (both those from our study group and the host students) and had some drinks. It was a great night, but at some point, after I had a bit to drink, I started crying over love. When he saw me, he asked me to go for a walk alone with him to calm down. We stayed by ourselves for about 30 minutes, and he said the most beautiful things I‚Äôve ever heard about what I was going through (I had been seeing a guy who said he liked me but didn‚Äôt really show it ‚Äî and since the beginning of that trip, I‚Äôd actually been interested in him). I explained everything without revealing that I‚Äôm gay. He comforted me, and we talked for a while. Then I asked if we could get a bottle of water; he came with me to a bar, lied about our ages, and bought me a Coke ‚Äî he paid for it without saying anything.

When we left, we rejoined the others, but he found another excuse for us to be alone again, taking a different street to go somewhere else for drinks. After spending the evening like that, we went home around 3 a.m., and he told me that even though he was exhausted, he‚Äôd stay awake and that I could text him. And so I did ‚Äî we talked until around 4 or 4:30 a.m.

The next day (the last one), we were supposed to go out with the group. When he saw no one was ready, I told him that the guy hosting me didn‚Äôt want to go out, and he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going out anyway ‚Äî if you want, we can go together.‚Äù That didn‚Äôt seem weird since we were supposed to meet the others. In the end, we went to a supermarket, bought croissants, water, and coffee ‚Äî and again he paid for me, saying it wasn‚Äôt a problem and I didn‚Äôt owe him anything. We had breakfast together, just the two of us, and spent about half an hour alone.

At the airport, we didn‚Äôt talk as much, but when he saw me sad about leaving, he hugged me and asked if I wanted to look around the shops together. He also said he‚Äôd get the same drink as me from Starbucks. On the plane, he kept checking on me and tried in every way to help charge my phone, worrying about me. On the bus ride home, I started crying again, and he jokingly called me ‚Äúhis man‚Äù while hugging me, as he had done several times before.

I don‚Äôt really know how to interpret all of this. We‚Äôre no longer on the trip, so we won‚Äôt see each other often, but we live in the same city. Throughout all this, he‚Äôs given me lots of compliments, and I feel like there might be something between us ‚Äî but at the same time, he used to be in a relationship with a girl, and he said he wasn‚Äôt gay but not in a direct way it was related to a joke we made about a thing, but i think he could be bisexual also because while talking about a talking stage he had with someone he used almost always neutral for when talking about ‚Äúthis person ‚Äú and sometimes he used the male gender too - recently was joking around with a girl from the trip (I think just as friends, though).

(If you guys have a better idea for where to post this, let me know!) 

I talk to a lot of Korean people learning English online, and so I have heard a lot of them use the words \`Me either\` instead of \`Me too\`. Passing by the fact that \`Me either\` is not grammatically correct anyway, and instead should be \`Me neither\`, (though I understand it rolls of the tongue better and even I myself use it in daily conversation) they almost never use it right. \`Me either\` (or \`Me neither\`) is only supposed to be used in response to a negative sentence. (E.g ""I don\`t like Coffee"" ""Me (n)either"" or ""I don\`t want to go to that show"" ""Me (n)either""). 

Instead they will use it to reply to Positive sentences ( ""I love that movie!"" ""Me either"" or ""I really like this song"" ""Me either"") I remember the first time I heard it, I brushed past it, then I heard my Korean friend say it and questioned him on it, not out of hostility just to help him improve his English. He denied my help though saying his English teacher taught him this and that he was going to continue using it as he believed his teacher was correct, which actually made me doubt myself at first. (No hate to my friend btw!!)

Since that, I have heard many more Korean people use this word in the wrong way. What led me to make this post was that I am in the middle of watching a ZB1 video and the member Gyuvin replied ""Me either"", it was in response to another member saying ""I\`m suspicious of you (""You being a 3rd person, not Gyuvin) So it didn\`t make sense. No hate to Gyuvin obviously, again just simply out of curiosity.

  
So in conclusion, \`Why do so many Korean people learning English incorrectly use the word \`Me either\`?. 

 A disclaimer, this is not hate to anyone mentioned in this post nor to anyone that says this. I am simply just curious as I\`ve heard it a lot and noticed a pattern. Also while English is my first language, I am in no way a qualified grammar user at all, and there is most likely many grammatical mistakes in my post. Thank you.",0,1761479383.0,ENGLISH,22,0.5,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Whether you live in a London apartment, a countryside cottage, or a modern townhouse, investing in high-quality European furniture can elevate your interiors with elegance, sophistication, and durability.

# 1. Outdoor Living for Every Season

Outdoor spaces are an essential part of modern UK homes. A well-furnished patio, garden, or balcony allows for relaxation and entertainment throughout the year.

[**4 Seasons Outdoor**](https://themodernfurniturecompany.com/collections/4-seasons-outdoor) offers weather-resistant furniture that combines comfort and style. Their modular sofas, dining sets, and loungers are designed to withstand the UK‚Äôs unpredictable weather. Add cushions, throws, and soft lighting to make your outdoor space cozy and inviting all year round.

# 2. Sleek Italian Design for Urban Homes

City apartments require furniture that is both practical and visually appealing. [**Bontempi Casa**](https://themodernfurniturecompany.com/collections/bontempi-casa) offers contemporary Italian designs perfect for open-plan living spaces.

From extendable dining tables to minimalist chairs and smart storage solutions, Bontempi Casa furniture maximizes space without compromising on style. Pair these pieces with neutral tones, textured rugs, and modern lighting for a refined, organized interior.

# 3. Statement Furniture for Luxurious Interiors

Luxury furniture can transform a room and create a striking focal point. [**Cattelan Italia**](https://themodernfurniturecompany.com/collections/cattelan-italia) is renowned for bold, artistic designs that bring sophistication to any space.

A marble dining table, sculptural coffee table, or glass console can define a living or dining area. In UK homes where contemporary and traditional styles merge, Cattelan Italia‚Äôs statement pieces provide elegance without overpowering the d√©cor. Keeping surrounding elements minimal allows these pieces to truly shine.

# 4. Natural Beauty with Wooden Furniture

Wooden furniture brings warmth, character, and timeless charm to interiors. [**Porada**](https://themodernfurniturecompany.com/collections/porada) specializes in finely crafted wooden furniture that is both functional and visually stunning.

From sideboards and tables to chairs and consoles, Porada pieces enhance the comfort and sophistication of UK homes. Pair wooden furniture with soft fabrics, neutral tones, and ambient lighting to create inviting, elegant interiors.

# 5. Layering Textures and Lighting

A well-designed home balances textures and lighting to create harmony. In the UK, layering light sources‚Äîsuch as pendant lights, floor lamps, and table lamps‚Äîis essential to counter limited daylight.

Mix materials like wood, glass, metal, and fabrics to add depth and interest. Layered rugs, cushions, and throws provide tactile comfort while enhancing the visual appeal of every room.

# 6. Personalize Your Space

Your home should reflect your personality. Incorporate artwork, family keepsakes, and decorative items to make interiors unique. Combining modern and traditional furniture adds character‚Äîfor example, pairing a contemporary Italian dining table with antique chairs or a sculptural console with classic d√©cor.

Investing in furniture from 4 Seasons Outdoor, Bontempi Casa, Cattelan Italia, and Porada ensures long-lasting style and functionality, forming a foundation for curated, comfortable interiors.

# 7. Sustainability and Longevity

Sustainability is a growing priority for UK homeowners. Choosing durable, responsibly made furniture reduces environmental impact while ensuring that your home remains elegant for years.

European brands prioritize longevity, craftsmanship, and eco-conscious production. Weatherproof outdoor furniture from 4 Seasons Outdoor and Porada‚Äôs handcrafted wooden pieces are examples of sustainable furniture that is both stylish and practical.

# 8. Bringing Your Home Together

A thoughtfully designed home balances style, functionality, and individuality. Start with a neutral colour palette, layer textures and lighting, and integrate both statement and versatile furniture pieces.

By incorporating the outdoor sophistication of 4 Seasons Outdoor, the modern elegance of Bontempi Casa, the luxurious artistry of Cattelan Italia, and the natural warmth of Porada, your UK home can embody timeless European design.

With high-quality furniture and careful design, your home becomes a reflection of your lifestyle‚Äîcomfortable, stylish, and uniquely yours.",1,1761479066.0,u_Business_Refuse_9579,0,1.0,False

Few nations have the reputation for romance and beauty that France enjoys. This makes a romantic trip to France an ideal option for your honeymoon. Of course, not all destinations in the country are on the same level, and you‚Äôll need to know the best honeymoon places in France, as well as where to find¬†[luxury rentals](https://isleblue.co/). In this guide, we will explore some of the best France honeymoon ideas and the best destinations in France for couples.

# Paris

We‚Äôll begin our list of honeymoon places in France with what is probably the most obvious ‚Äì Paris. The City of Love is home to some of the most romantic sights you‚Äôll find, including the Seine River, the Eiffel Tower, and numerous others. Just strolling the ancient cobblestone streets, sipping coffee at a roadside caf√©, or indulging in a delicious sweet treat can be the key to romance. Take your love to Notre Dame, the Arc de Triomphe, or Tuileries Garden while you‚Äôre in the city. For honeymooners, expect to spend around $300 per day, including your hotel and access to attractions.

# Sancerre

Who doesn‚Äôt love a fine French wine? You can couple that with the love you feel for your spouse with a visit to Sancerre, the heart of wine country. This is an excellent option for anyone considering honeymoon places in France because you can spend hours just looking out over the miles and miles of vineyards. Make sure to save space on your France honeymoon itinerary for some of the area‚Äôs top romantic destinations. These include the House of Sancerre, as well as Domaine Henri Bourgeois, and Pascal Jolivet. From vineyards for formal gardens to wine tastings, this is a destination you will both savor for years to come. In terms of budget, this destination is less expensive than some others, and you‚Äôll likely spend around $225 per day.

# Annecy

One of the most romantic towns in France, Annecy is a riot of colors set on the river, with the mountains as a backdrop. Canals cut through the town, adding a touch of whimsy. It‚Äôs far enough away from the main tourist destinations that it is rarely crowded, and it makes a great jumping off point for an alpine adventure, as well. During your stay, you really should head to Lake Annecy, where you can stroll along the edge or even rent a boat. Pont des Amours, and Chateau d‚ÄôAnnecy are also romantic destinations to explore while you‚Äôre in town. You‚Äôll likely spend around $300 per night here, including your accommodations.

# Lyon

Lyon ranks as one of the most romantic of all honeymoon places in France. It‚Äôs set right on the banks of the River Saone and the Rhone River. The city dates back 2,000 years, and that history is etched into virtually every stone. From the soaring spires of the cathedral to the massive columns of the Renaissance style architecture, you will both be in for an exceptional experience. While you‚Äôre in town, a visit to the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourviere is a must. You should also make time to visit the Lyon Cathedral, as well as the Gallo-Roman Museum of Lyon-Fourviere. Lyon comes in cheaper than some of the other best places to honeymoon in France, and you will probably spend around $230 per day.

# Saint-Paul de Vence

One of the most romantic places in the French Riviera,¬†[Saint-Paul de Vence](https://www.saint-pauldevence.com/en/)¬†is an ancient town that has never forgotten its medieval roots. Home to artists and crafters, this is an incredibly romantic destination. Stroll the ancient streets, visit Chateau Grimaldi, explore the Seiller Art Gallery, or visit the Musee d‚Äô Histoire Local. A night here will cost around $300, including your accommodations.

# Calvi

Looking for French Riviera honeymoon ideas? Calvi is a great option. It is set right on the rugged coastline, and is very reminiscent of the towns along Italy‚Äôs Amalfi Coast. While you‚Äôre in town, visit Calvi Cathedral, or spend some time at Phare de la Revellata hiking the beautiful area. Plage de l‚ÄôAlga is the place to go for a little sunbathing in the Mediterranean warmth. This is one of the more affordable options when it comes to the best honeymoon places in France, and you will probably spend around $250 per night.

# Bordeaux

Bordeaux conjures up images of red wines and massive vineyards, but there‚Äôs so much more that makes this a great south of France honeymoon. A honeymoon in Bordeaux allows you to experience amazing architecture, romantic destinations, rich culture, and immense history. While you‚Äôre in town for your honeymoon, take part in a wine harvest if possible (September through October). You can explore the Arcachon sand dunes, explore the local dining and drink options, and dance the night away, as well. Bordeaux will cost less than Paris, but more than some other destinations ‚Äì it‚Äôs the ninth largest city in the country, after all. So, you should probably budget around $250 or so per night.

# Nevers

Located in one of France‚Äôs more rural areas, Nevers makes our list of the best places in France for a honeymoon for several reasons. It‚Äôs incredibly beautiful, with medieval architecture on full display. There are also plenty of things to do, from strolling the picturesque town square to dining and drinking. The nearest airport to Nevers, France is Clermont-Ferrand Auvergne Airport. You‚Äôll find that Nevers is less expensive than many other destinations in France, too, and you will probably be able to spend under $250 per day.

# Dordogne

If you‚Äôre interested in a honeymoon that‚Äôs a little out of the norm, then consider visiting Dordogne. It‚Äôs a picture-postcard destination set within the stunning Loire Valley. You‚Äôll find ancient villages and castles nearby, as well as rivers and mountains, and even caves that can be explored if you‚Äôre a bit more adventurous. During a stay, make sure you make time to visit the National Museum of Prehistory, as well as the Zoological Reserve Calviac. Plan to spend just under $300 per day during your stay here.

# In Conclusion

We‚Äôve discussed some of the best honeymoon places in France, but there are numerous others you can explore. Or, head southwest from France and explore the incredible destinations to be found in Spain. In addition, you may decide that you want to experience more destinations like those found in the south of France. The Caribbean might be a world away, but you‚Äôll find thousands of jewel-like islands scattered across the blue sea, white sand beaches, swaying palm trees, and more.¬†[Luxury villas in Barbados](https://isleblue.co/barbados/villas)¬†offer you a comfortable place to stay in privacy while on the islands, or you can explore your options for¬†[Turks and Caicos homes for](https://isleblue.co/turks-and-caicos/villas)¬†rent if you want more space and even more privacy.",1,1761479064.0,LuxuryVillasFrance,0,1.0,False

1ogijn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/1ogijn6/why_do_so_many_korean_people_learning_english/,Why do so many Korean people learning English incorrectly use the word `Me either`?,"I know this is a reddit for Korean learners but I didn\`t know where else to post this and I am genuinely curious. (If you guys have a better idea for where to post this, let me know!) 

I talk to a lot of Korean people learning English online, and so I have heard a lot of them use the words \`Me either\` instead of \`Me too\`. Passing by the fact that \`Me either\` is not grammatically correct anyway, and instead should be \`Me neither\`, (though I understand it rolls of the tongue better and even I myself use it in daily conversation) they almost never use it right. \`Me either\` (or \`Me neither\`) is only supposed to be used in response to a negative sentence. (E.g ""I don\`t like Coffee"" ""Me (n)either"" or ""I don\`t want to go to that show"" ""Me (n)either""). 

Instead they will use it to reply to Positive sentences ( ""I love that movie!"" ""Me either"" or ""I really like this song"" ""Me either"") I remember the first time I heard it, I brushed past it, then I heard my Korean friend say it and questioned him on it, not out of hostility just to help him improve his English. He denied my help though saying his English teacher taught him this and that he was going to continue using it as he believed his teacher was correct, which actually made me doubt myself at first. (No hate to my friend btw!!)

Since that, I have heard many more Korean people use this word in the wrong way. What led me to make this post was that I am in the middle of watching a ZB1 video and the member Gyuvin replied ""Me either"", it was in response to another member saying ""I\`m suspicious of you (""You being a 3rd person, not Gyuvin) So it didn\`t make sense. No hate to Gyuvin obviously, again just simply out of curiosity.

  
So in conclusion, \`Why do so many Korean people learning English incorrectly use the word \`Me either\`?. 

 A disclaimer, this is not hate to anyone mentioned in this post nor to anyone that says this. I am simply just curious as I\`ve heard it alot and noticed a pattern.

1ogigy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1ogigy3/burnout_cannot_function/,"Burnout, cannot function","I am seriously going though a really hard time. My son (7) is a handful, he would be level 1 however we don't use this term in Europe, and I am working very hard to get him official diagnosis to get him support at school (clinical psychologist did confirm but he also needs offically to go through specialists at autism clinic to get  the support, and the process is so slow). So I am doing a lot here, calls with school, doctors, trying to push it faster, advocating for him,  ... it's a lot, and it seems it's not moving at all. He is difficult at home, he screams and kicks furniture over the smallest things, daily.

I am diagnosed. And it's all too much. It seems all the autistic symptomps I have, had escelated by 100%. I can't handle any noise (I am getting loop earplugs), I can no longer go for coffee with a friend because I am always too tired, my body is just always exhausted, I just hate going into work (it's a new job one year contract) and people have started to notice I don't really socialize (one thing is I am not good at it, and the other I have no energy to mask), I just want to lie down and do nothing. I cannot handle touch (I used to be able to to some extend), I find it a lot to be doing stuff with my kids (my daughter is one of those mellow lovely calm girls, and even that is too much now). I used to go hiking with my dog and it made a difference, now I force myself to go on a short walk, and then hate coming back home because kids are loud. I used to take kids out to the park etc and loved it, now even dragging myself to the car is hard.

I dont know what I'll do about work. I cry every morning in the car beceuse I am tired. Last time I was picking up my daughter I had to grab the locker to hold myself as I felt like fainting. 

I think the last 7 years have led to this, but it was also other things, for example at my last permanent job I was severy bullied for 2 years by my manager and I think since then I just can't function normaly, probably also had something to do with PTSD as I was bullied at school a lot. I hate shops as they seem to bright, I can handle libriries to some extend but also less and less. My.selfharm has increased a lot in terms of pain, I actually nearly seriously injured myself because I was so overwhelmed. I've always done self harm, but never to that extend before.

Is this autistic burnout? And what to do? If I had a perm position I would take sick leave, but I am afraid to do that at temp position.

What can I do, advice please as I am completely drained.

Edit: my post was written in a way it made me sound like a single mum. I am sorry about this, I do get some free time which just makes me feel quilty because some parents don't and I just sound spoiled now. However still, all the family logistics, school trips, doctors, etc is on me. My husband took over doing homework with him and now helps more with bed time, so perphaps I am just not tough enough.

1ogigrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ogigrm/my_story_as_a_virtual_assistant/,My Story as a Virtual Assistant,"Just want to share my story...

I signed the contract on a Friday night while the neighbors were singing karaoke and the rain was making soft drips on our tin roof. The client (international) said she had been burned before, so she wanted to pay only after the project was complete. Three months, clear milestones, clean scope. I told myself it would be fine. I wanted to believe that trust could be built across the ocean, across time zones, across a life where I counted every peso while the world kept turning.

The first month was a blur of early mornings and past midnight calls. She would ring me just as the roosters started to shout, then again when Manila fell asleep. I built her trackers, cleaned her CRM, reconciled her numbers, and wrote simple guides so her team would stop losing files. She asked if I could also manage her inbox for a week because her phone kept buzzing while she drove. It was not part of my role, but I said yes. I wrote replies that made her sound calm and in control. The week became the whole month.

By the second month I was answering her SMS messages and calling her clients to confirm appointments, pretending to be the assistant she never hired. I set up calendar blocks, moved meetings away from school runs, and took notes while she spoke in a hurried voice that always sounded like she was running for a train. She said again that payments would start once we wrapped the project. She said she had been hurt by freelancers who disappeared and she needed to protect herself. I thought of my Meralco bill, the water bill, rent, rice, my mom‚Äôs maintenance meds, and the tiny envelope I kept for emergencies. I told myself that patience was a skill. I told myself I could carry the weight a little longer.

The project grew legs. New features crawled in through every email. Can you also set up the newsletter. Can you also build a dashboard for revenue. Can you also call the vendor because they keep ignoring me. Can you also find a cheaper tool. I built, I called, I negotiated, I documented, I cleaned. I turned chaos into checklists and then checked every box one by one. I updated her every week, sent a tidy summary, and asked each time when we could begin partial payments since half the scope was already done. She said next week. She said two more tasks. She said almost there.

At the start of the third month my phone buzzed with messages I did not want to read. Overdue notices. Gentle reminders that did not feel gentle. I did the usual math in my head. If I skip the postpaid load and borrow the Wi Fi of my cousin next door, if I move the due date of the credit card, if I stretch the groceries for two more days, if I skip coffee from the store and just use the three in one sachets left in the jar, maybe I can keep going. I kept going.

I finished the project plan. I delivered the automation. I cleaned her historical records and made her weekly status dashboard pretty enough for a boardroom. I handed over the onboarding packet that would save her team hours. I sent the final email with all the links and passwords, and the closing note I had rehearsed in my head while washing dishes. Thank you for trusting me. As agreed please process the full invoice.

She read the message. Then she disappeared.

Her avatar stayed online for a while, a small green dot that mocked me. My last few texts were blue bubbles that never turned into replies. My inbox grew quiet around the same time the house grew louder with worry. My mom asked me if everything was alright. I told her yes. I told her it was just a delay. I cooked rice and one egg and split it between us and said the yolk looked like the sun.

Bills do not care about oceans. They do not care about time zones or promises or how polite you sound when you ask to be paid for work already done. They arrive and pile up, each one heavy as a sack of sand. I thought about calling her clients again just to hear a human voice and prove I still existed. I thought about sending her a final message with all the words I had swallowed for weeks. Instead I opened my tracker and closed the project as unpaid.

I felt small in that moment. Not because of the money, although the money mattered. I felt small because I had been so careful and still I had been taken for a ride. I had set boundaries and then let them blur because I wanted to be the one who could fix everything. I had believed that if I just did a little more, added one more slide, answered one more call at three in the morning, she would see my effort and keep her promise.

I learned that people can hide behind nice words and still hurt you. I learned that being kind does not mean saying yes to everything. I learned to send a simple rule with every new contract. Partial payment at kickoff. Milestone payments at delivery. No access until cleared. No new tasks without a new scope. I learned to value my sleep and my lights and my peace.

The story sounds horrible because it is. It is the kind of story many remote workers here know by heart. We hold families together while holding our breath between invoices. We carry entire businesses on spreadsheets and sticky notes and quiet strength. We show up on time even when the city is flooding. We keep going.

I still believe most clients are good. I still believe in work that changes a life. I still answer emails with respect and build systems with care. But now when someone says they have been burned before so they want to pay at the end, I remember the green dot that went dark, and I remember the egg I split in half, and I say no with a steady voice.

To anyone reading this who leads a team or hires remote talent, know that we work hard, we carry families, and we deserve to be paid on time. If you value that kind of steady care, I will show up with the same quiet grit that kept me going, only this time with boundaries that protect both of us so the work can shine.

1ogig6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_OkMessage9504/comments/1ogig6w/5_outdoor_furniture_trends_youll_love_in_2025/,5 Outdoor Furniture Trends You‚Äôll Love in 2025,"As we step into 2025, outdoor spaces are becoming more than just extensions of our homes ‚Äî they‚Äôre turning into personalized havens for relaxation, entertainment, and creativity. Whether it‚Äôs a cozy balcony setup or a full-fledged garden retreat, people are investing more time and effort into making their outdoor environments functional, stylish, and tech-friendly.

In **New Delhi**, where modern living meets cultural charm, homeowners and businesses alike are embracing new design trends that redefine outdoor comfort. Interestingly, this shift isn‚Äôt just about furniture ‚Äî it‚Äôs about creating **experiences**. And with advancements in technology, elements like [**Outdoor LED Screen for Advertising**](https://orion-led.com/outdoor/) and the **Best Outdoor LED Display** are blending seamlessly with modern outdoor designs, bringing a unique fusion of lifestyle and innovation.

Here are the **five outdoor furniture trends** you‚Äôll absolutely love in 2025 ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôre planning to elevate your outdoor living or commercial space.

# 1. Smart Outdoor Spaces with Integrated Technology

The future of outdoor design is smart ‚Äî and 2025 is all about intelligent integration. From Bluetooth-enabled speakers built into furniture to solar-powered lighting and weather-resistant charging stations, technology is making outdoor spaces more interactive than ever.

But that‚Äôs not all. Businesses and homeowners in **New Delhi** are also using **Outdoor LED Screen for Advertising** as part of their outdoor setup. Imagine hosting a rooftop dinner or a garden party while a sleek LED display plays ambient visuals or even live sports. The same display can double as an advertising tool for cafes, lounges, or hotels ‚Äî blending functionality with aesthetics.

The **Best Outdoor LED Display** not only enhances visual appeal but also adds a futuristic touch to your space, transforming it into a multi-purpose entertainment zone.

# 2. Sustainable and Eco-Friendly Materials

Sustainability continues to be a top priority in 2025. Consumers are choosing furniture made from **eco-friendly materials** like recycled wood, rattan, bamboo, and metal alloys that are both durable and environmentally responsible.

In **New Delhi**, where pollution and climate concerns are on the rise, adopting sustainable materials isn‚Äôt just a design choice ‚Äî it‚Äôs a lifestyle shift. Brands are focusing on long-lasting outdoor pieces that resist harsh weather and reduce waste.

Even LED technology supports this green movement. Modern **Outdoor LED Screen for Advertising** solutions consume less power and last longer, helping businesses minimize their environmental footprint while maintaining top-notch visual impact.

# 3. Comfort-Driven Minimalism

2025 is seeing a clear design shift toward **comfort-driven minimalism**. The ‚Äúless is more‚Äù philosophy continues to dominate, with clean lines, neutral colors, and ergonomic designs taking center stage. Outdoor spaces are now designed to feel like natural extensions of indoor living rooms ‚Äî cozy, calm, and clutter-free.

Think modular sofas, weatherproof loungers, and versatile coffee tables that can adapt to multiple settings. Neutral tones like beige, gray, and terracotta are making waves this year, paired with earthy textures and soft lighting.

Adding the **Best Outdoor LED Display** to such minimalist setups provides an elegant balance ‚Äî offering digital brightness without overpowering the natural ambiance. Whether it‚Äôs used to showcase art visuals, soft ambient videos, or brand promotions, LED screens effortlessly enhance the aesthetics of modern outdoor spaces in **New Delhi**.

# 4. Multi-Functional Outdoor Zones

Homeowners are no longer limiting outdoor furniture to just patios and balconies. In 2025, multifunctional zones are taking over ‚Äî think open-air lounges that double as workspaces, or dining areas that transform into movie zones at night.

This trend has given rise to more **flexible furniture** ‚Äî foldable, stackable, and modular designs that make reconfiguration simple and stylish. In commercial settings like restaurants, rooftop cafes, and event venues across **New Delhi**, this adaptability is key to making the most of limited space.

To complement these dynamic setups, many venues are incorporating **Outdoor LED Screen for Advertising**. Not only does it provide entertainment or display promotional offers, but it also creates a vibrant visual experience for visitors. The [**Best Outdoor LED Display**](https://orionled7.wordpress.com/2025/10/25/the-future-of-visual-communication-how-led-display-manufacturers-in-india-are-transforming-advertising/) ensures high brightness and clarity, even under daylight ‚Äî perfect for open-air environments.

# 5. Outdoor Wellness Retreats

With wellness becoming a top priority worldwide, outdoor spaces are now being designed as **personal wellness retreats**. From yoga decks and meditation corners to spa-inspired lounges, people are focusing on serenity and balance.

Soft cushions, natural stone elements, calming water features, and plants that purify the air are becoming must-haves. These spaces are all about mental and emotional rejuvenation.

In **New Delhi**, where city life can be fast-paced, having a calming outdoor zone is more than a luxury ‚Äî it‚Äôs a necessity. Some homeowners are even incorporating the **Best Outdoor LED Display** to play soothing visuals or nature-inspired animations that enhance the overall atmosphere.

For businesses, wellness-inspired outdoor spaces are also proving to be powerful marketing tools. A strategically placed **Outdoor LED Screen for Advertising** can subtly promote health events, organic products, or wellness programs while adding a touch of innovation to the environment.

# Bringing It All Together

What ties all these trends together is the **fusion of comfort, design, and technology**. The outdoor furniture market in 2025 is no longer just about chairs and tables ‚Äî it‚Äôs about crafting complete outdoor experiences.

In **New Delhi**, this evolution is particularly visible in luxury apartments, commercial rooftops, and boutique resorts. The integration of **Outdoor LED Screen for Advertising** is transforming how people interact with outdoor environments ‚Äî turning every corner into a space that‚Äôs both relaxing and functional.

And with the [**Best Outdoor LED Display,**](https://orion-led.com/outdoor/) the possibilities are endless. Whether you‚Äôre watching a live match under the stars, promoting your brand in a vibrant public area, or simply enhancing your patio aesthetics, LED displays add that extra spark of modern sophistication.

# Final Thoughts

Outdoor living in 2025 is all about personalization, sustainability, and smart innovation. From eco-friendly furniture and tech-driven setups to immersive lighting and wellness-inspired designs, the trend is clear ‚Äî outdoor spaces are the new heart of modern living.

If you‚Äôre in **New Delhi**, now‚Äôs the perfect time to embrace these trends. Combine stylish furniture with the **Best Outdoor LED Display**, and you‚Äôll create an outdoor area that‚Äôs not only visually appealing but also future-ready.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

We're all flooded with ""health hacks"" every day, and it‚Äôs exhausting to figure out what's real and what's a myth.

For my work, I spend a lot of time researching health topics (I work as a medical concierge, helping people coordinate complex health screenings). I recently compiled a list of practical, preventative health tips that are backed by studies but not widely known.

[10 Actionable Preventative Health Tips You Might Be Overlooking](https://preview.redd.it/sd94ls6tzfxf1.jpg?width=689&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cb26b92941efe2300687f6a75da9aa47f512204f)

I was genuinely surprised by some of them and thought I‚Äôd share a few of my favorites here.

# 1. Grapefruit is a ""Public Enemy"" to Many Common Drugs

This one is wild. Your liver uses a specific enzyme (CYP3A4) to break down many common drugs, including those for high blood pressure, high cholesterol (statins), and even some cancer treatments.

Grapefruit contains compounds that *massively* inhibit this enzyme.

The result? The drug doesn't get metabolized, builds up in your bloodstream to potentially toxic levels, and can cause severe side effects. It‚Äôs not just grapefruit, either‚ÄîSeville oranges (often in marmalade) and tangelos can do it, too.

# 2. Your ""Healthy"" Scalding Hot Tea Could Increase Cancer Risk

Many of us love a piping hot cup of tea or coffee. But studies have found that *consistently* drinking beverages hotter than 60¬∞C (140¬∞F) significantly increases the risk of esophageal cancer.

It‚Äôs not the tea itself, but the physical heat. It causes repeated thermal injury to the lining of your esophagus, forcing your cells into a constant ""damage-repair"" cycle, which can eventually lead to malignant changes. The simple preventative tip: just wait 5-6 minutes for it to cool down.

# 3. Your Houseplants Aren't Purifying Your Air

This was a tough one for me, as I have plants everywhere. We've all heard that houseplants filter VOCs and clean the air.

However, a major review study found that you would need a literal *jungle*‚Äîsomewhere between 100 and 1,000 plants in a small office‚Äîto have the same air-purifying effect as simply opening a window or turning on a ventilator for an hour. While they're great for mental health, don't rely on them to clean your air.

These are just 3 of the 10 tips I wrote about. The list also covers common myths about plucking white hair, the *real* reason juicing isn't as healthy as you think, and why you might feel dizzy after standing up.

But the most important tip, in my opinion, is the last one, which details **the specific health screenings you need after age 40.**

This is the part of preventative health that gets complicated. Knowing when to get a low-dose CT scan for lung cancer, a PSA test for men, or an HPV/TCT test for women isn't common knowledge.

I put the full, detailed list together in a blog post for anyone interested in taking that next step.

Like ok . All of us are aware of the fucked up gender ratio of dating apps . So even if you right swipe your like will be at the bottom probably. And the girl might not even see Bcz there are like 50 more guys in front of you .
From guys perspective men who pays for the app or buy roses or whatever just skip the line and ordinary people like you and me again comes at a disadvantage.


And what‚Äôs up with the expectations on dating apps . Bhai kuch bhi sensible n lg rha . 
Cafe hoping , coffee-croissant , expensive exotic dinners, clubbing/parties or people flexing about drinking  . To top it off let‚Äôs find someone over 6ft. 

Relatable hi ni ho pa rha mera to . 

For a guy like me I like a common music taste , spending time over walks , maybe just watch a sunset away from city , having coffee at lakeshore or maybe holding hands and talking your heart out . End of the day with some comfort food idk maybe rajma chawal ü§£

Anyways nature , vibes , character gya tel lene . 4 prompts ChatGPT se uthao . 4 paise app pe lagao . 4 ladkiyo se 4 din ka hi hello , 4 din ka relationship aur 4 din ka breakup .

Hey there!

I have always been a bit of an introverted loner, but these last few months have made me realise that I am no longer just mostly alone, but that I‚Äôm actually lonely.

Hand grinder take too long on weekdays
Electric burr grinder are expensive 

So I was thinking if blade grinders would be significant improvement over pre ground coffee

If we think in terms of percentages, how much of the overall coffee quality improvement would you get with:
	‚Ä¢	pre-ground coffee (baseline)
	‚Ä¢	blade grinder
	‚Ä¢	burr grinder

My guess is that a cheap blade grinder might already get you around 80% of the way there compared to a burr grinder. Does that sound right, or am I overestimating it?

1ogi77k,https://www.reddit.com/r/brealism/comments/1ogi77k/practical_explanation_about_next_life/,Practical explanation about next life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1oghpir,https://www.reddit.com/r/gayrelationships/comments/1oghpir/i_need_help_with_this_situation/,I need help with this situation,"It‚Äôs been a couple of days since I met a guy during a study trip. He and I immediately got along and joked a lot about everything. The last four days were when I started to feel something between us. One of those days we spent together with the others at the beach and at a sushi restaurant, where he had never been before ‚Äî he even asked me for advice. At the beach, he made everyone wait 10 minutes just so I could get my swimsuit, which another guy had borrowed.

One day, while we were coming back from a group outing, he and I fell behind to talk alone about relationships and dating. He told me about a girl he used to talk to and how things ended between them. I listened and gave him my opinion. Then we started talking about homosexuality, and he said he supports it and isn‚Äôt homophobic.

When we got back home, we went to sleep, and the next day he called me to see if I was running late. That day we spent time joking and playing together on the school‚Äôs sports field with the others. We ate in the same place and kept teasing each other. Then he asked me, away from everyone else, to come with him to find a bathroom, so we were alone for a while. We talked about how some people on this trip wanted to start relationships or just hook up, and we agreed that things should go slowly and not be rushed. We stayed alone a bit longer, then took a short walk to rejoin the others.

That evening, we all went out together (both those from our study group and the host students) and had some drinks. It was a great night, but at some point, after I had a bit to drink, I started crying over love. When he saw me, he asked me to go for a walk alone with him to calm down. We stayed by ourselves for about 30 minutes, and he said the most beautiful things I‚Äôve ever heard about what I was going through (I had been seeing a guy who said he liked me but didn‚Äôt really show it ‚Äî and since the beginning of that trip, I‚Äôd actually been interested in him). I explained everything without revealing that I‚Äôm gay. He comforted me, and we talked for a while. Then I asked if we could get a bottle of water; he came with me to a bar, lied about our ages, and bought me a Coke ‚Äî he paid for it without saying anything.

When we left, we rejoined the others, but he found another excuse for us to be alone again, taking a different street to go somewhere else for drinks. After spending the evening like that, we went home around 3 a.m., and he told me that even though he was exhausted, he‚Äôd stay awake and that I could text him. And so I did ‚Äî we talked until around 4 or 4:30 a.m.

The next day (the last one), we were supposed to go out with the group. When he saw no one was ready, I told him that the guy hosting me didn‚Äôt want to go out, and he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going out anyway ‚Äî if you want, we can go together.‚Äù That didn‚Äôt seem weird since we were supposed to meet the others. In the end, we went to a supermarket, bought croissants, water, and coffee ‚Äî and again he paid for me, saying it wasn‚Äôt a problem and I didn‚Äôt owe him anything. We had breakfast together, just the two of us, and spent about half an hour alone.

At the airport, we didn‚Äôt talk as much, but when he saw me sad about leaving, he hugged me and asked if I wanted to look around the shops together. He also said he‚Äôd get the same drink as me from Starbucks. On the plane, he kept checking on me and tried in every way to help charge my phone, worrying about me. On the bus ride home, I started crying again, and he jokingly called me ‚Äúhis man‚Äù while hugging me, as he had done several times before.

I don‚Äôt really know how to interpret all of this. We‚Äôre no longer on the trip, so we won‚Äôt see each other often, but we live in the same city. Throughout all this, he‚Äôs given me lots of compliments, and I feel like there might be something between us ‚Äî but at the same time, he used to be in a relationship with a girl, and he said he wasn‚Äôt gay but not in a direct way it was related to a joke we made about a thing, but i think he could be bisexual also because while talking about a talking stage he had with someone he used almost always neutral for when talking about ‚Äúthis person ‚Äú and sometimes he used the male gender too - recently was joking around with a girl from the trip (I think just as friends, though).

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Lists and notes never really worked for me, so I decided to build a small Android app to help track what‚Äôs in your fridge and pantry.

The app lets you:

* Log items with purchase and expiration dates
* Organize by category or location
* Get alerts before products expire
* Quickly add or find items by scanning barcodes

I‚Äôd love to hear what you think about the idea and if anything feels missing.

1oghfl0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oghfl0,Pretty Happy With My Espresso/Filter Coffee Station,"Loving where my espresso/filter workstation is at right now. Got it setup to start with grinding in the centre, and then either working to the right for espresso, or left for pourover.



Have found two things really clutch when organising the layout. First using Amazon bar mats as a way to contain grinds and mess. They're way cheaper than coffee branded mats and come in heaps of sizes. Means I don't mind brushing a few coffee grinds straight onto them because they're so easy to pickup and clean in the sink when needed. Plus they work as a place to air-dry washed equipment like jugs, filter drippers, etc

Secondly using magnets everywhere I can. Got the subliminal flick WDT and dosing ring magnetically hung on above the tamping station on the side of the machine, in spot that's really natural to grab and use. On the grinder I keep a spoon and mini whisk for quick dosing and pourover manual agitation.

Been very happy with the Philos with i200 burrs too, even after moving it into a horizontal orientation the workflow with it is always just so straightforward.

Whole things on a little island I assembled. The bar flap has been great when guests have come over for coffee, as they've instinctively just sat on the seats across the bar. Plus the drawers and shelves have been exclusively for coffee gear / cups / jugs.",3,1761475191.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

After that I‚Äôm open to suggestions haha. 

I‚Äôm a bit of an inexperienced guy, never really dated and the idea posting here is to talk and get to know someone who is okay being a bit more understanding that I‚Äôm a bit new to all this. Open to making friends, long term fun or just something casual.

I know this sub isn‚Äôt really for advertising dates and is more just straight hookups but I‚Äôd rather ease into things and get to know someone first. 

I can send a pic if you‚Äôre interested but description wise I‚Äôm 5 10, short brown hair, medium build. I like to read, go to the movies, started working out recently, and i like going for walks around the city. I‚Äôm a sociable, funny guy (I think lol) happy to chat and see if we‚Äôre a good match!

An odder type of post on here but if you‚Äôre interested let me know!

One day my tics are manageable, the next it feels like my nervous system decided to host its own EDM festival. I've been trying to play detective with my own symptoms to understand what sets things off and what actually helps.

I started keeping notes in my phone - basic stuff like tic frequency, stress levels, sleep quality, and activities. It's been somewhat helpful (turns out coffee and video games are major triggers for me), but I feel like I'm missing the bigger picture.

During my research, i found app that helps track symptoms and treatments specifically for neurological conditions. What caught my attention was their focus on medical cannabis as a potential management option. I've been curious about trying it for tic reduction but honestly feel overwhelmed by all the different strains and options. The idea of having a systematic way to track how different approaches affect my tics really appeals to me.

I'm wondering what's worked for everyone else:

Has anyone found good tracking methods or apps that actually help?

For those who've tried medical cannabis - what was your experience? Did certain strains work better than others? How did you track the effects on both tics and side effects?

What unexpected patterns have you discovered through tracking your symptoms?

Really curious to hear what's helped you understand and manage your tics better. This condition can feel so random sometimes - it's comforting to know we're all figuring this out together.",2,1761475133.0,Tourettes,2,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1ogh8ni,https://www.reddit.com/r/YourReality/comments/1ogh8ni/searching_for_meaning_of_life_here_that_is/,searching for meaning of life ? here that is -,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Been doing research and decided to put my grownup money to use and 

The Tank is 50 US gallons (191 liters)
3 feet by 1.5 by 1.5.
The stand was also made by the same local business that made the tank.

Stocked with 15 Tiger barbs, 2 Siamese algae eaters and 10 yellow Neocaridina shrimp

The tank is filled with plants and at this point I‚Äôve lost track on what plants I have üòÖ
But from I remember I have a Pearlweed carpet, Some crypts, swords, Water wisteria,  Amazon Frogbit and Red root floaters.

I had a diy CO2 system which was really hard to control and gave me a horrible algae bloom. I have since removed it.

I made the filter myself with a planter and bio ceramic rings. There‚Äôs also a powerhead filter running which

1ogh5xq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtendedReality/comments/1ogh5xq/goal_of_the_human_life/,goal of the human life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1761474203.0,ExtendedReality,0,1.0,False
