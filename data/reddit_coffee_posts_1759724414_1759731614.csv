1nzbhko,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1nzbhko/taking_medicines_and_spg/,Taking medicines and SPG,"I started having migraines last Thursday. I woke up at 5 a.m. with a severe migraine and vomited several times in the morning—including by the roadside and even at my office desk. Luckily, I had a plastic bag with me.

I went to the healthcare center at my university, where they gave me a CAFFOX tablet. I've been taking it, but it hasn't helped much. Yesterday, I visited another clinic, and the doctor there suggested directly blocking the pain. I forgot the exact name of the procedure (might be SPG). He asked me to lie down with my head hanging and used an injection and a nasal tube to administer drops through my nose. He said this method is quite effective nowadays and mentioned that he's a trained neurologist and anesthetic surgeon. He also gave me another version of CAFFOX (which he said works better for migraines) and Celebrex.

My migraine attacks are most severe in the morning. For example, I had three episodes today—each time I woke up. The pain was more acute than ever; I don't think I've experienced anything like this before.

I used to get migraines once every 3–5 years, but when they came, they would last for weeks or even months. I suspect it's related to climate or weather changes. I don't drink alcohol, but I do have coffee daily—at least one cup.

I tried acupuncture yesterday, but I didn’t feel much relief. I'm considering going for another session tomorrow to see if it helps.

Has anyone experienced something similar? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I also enjoy reading, mostly fantasy. Currently, my list includes Chloe Gong's Vilest Things and Murakami's The City and Its Uncertain Walls.

I do like to watch Sports, I follow the Giants, Mets, Knicks, Devils and Tottenham Hotspur in the EPL.

Music taste is all over the place, I like stuff from Kpop to Pop Punk, all the way to some country and I'll even have some Andrea Boccelli queued up from time to time.

I still enjoy coffee tastings as well, but I've had to chill out on that for a bit.

1nzb7i8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nzb7i8/entitled_best_friend_demanded_attention_from_my/,Entitled best friend demanded attention from my SIL’s husband and played the victim when she wasn’t invited to the wedding,"NOTE: I posted it earlier with the title Bestfriend vs Girlfriend: After Wedding DRAMA. I changed reposted with fake names now since it has been so chaotic to read this.

\--------------------------------

For context, this is not my story. However, I am heavily involved as their friend and family (to my sister-in-law).

My sister-in-law, **Maya (23F),** just got married to my college guy friend, **Ethan (28M)**—let’s call him Maya’s husband. Now, Ethan has two girl best friends, but let’s focus on one. Let’s call her **Nicole (25F).**

The thing is, Maya and Ethan had been friends for 8 years. They’ve known each other for that long but never got romantically involved until January 2025.

On the other hand, Ethan had been “best friends” with Nicole for around 6–8 years. **I (25F),** have been a close friend of these two since around the same time. I practically know their relationship and have been observant ever since.

When we were in college, I sincerely thought that Nicole and Ethan had feelings for one another, which they totally dismissed. But I noticed that Ethan didn’t really open up to Nicole, even though they were “best friends.” Unknown to me, Ethan had actually been opening up to Maya and felt comfortable doing so since they reconnected around 2023.

Fast forward to their relationship: January 2025, Ethan started to court Maya, and by May, they officially got together.

For context, Ethan had already been asking Maya on random dates since December 2023, using the excuse that he saw her as a “younger sister,” not realizing that he was actually already in love with her. Maya is Ethan’s first girlfriend.

Now, since Ethan confessed his feelings and began officially courting Maya, Nicole has been acting like a total a-hole. She suddenly wanted Ethan’s attention even though she practically didn’t care about him at all before this relationship.

There was a time that it was church after lunch and Nicole had been calling Ethan to go with her for lunch knowing and clearly seeing that Maya is there. Nicole is NOT inviting Maya, just Ethan.

""Ethan, you are so slow, let's eat outside.""

Ethan had to pull her aside to tell her that he would be eating lunch with Maya. Maya, that time, left Ethan with a pout on her face—no words, just the face.

Nicole had a failed relationship where she was sincerely the victim—her partner cheated on her after 4 years. However, during those years, she casually still went on “dates” with Ethan even though her partner wasn’t comfortable with it. Personally, I didn’t like that because respect for your partner should come first, and there should be clear boundaries—which clearly they didn’t have at the time.

Back to 2025: Nicole has shown Maya a lot of disrespect by constantly asking for Ethan’s attention, demanding “dates,” and such—until things got out of hand. People in their circle began to talk, and the rumor spread that Nicole might have hidden feelings for Ethan.

When Nicole heard about this talk, she completely shut everyone off. Ethan tried to talk with her, but she rejected it, saying no. So Maya and Ethan let go of the situation.

UNTIL their other best friend, Yvonne (27F), came back to the country. Nicole played the victim. She basically antagonized everyone and told Yvonne that Ethan had “forgotten their friendship,” when in reality Nicole was the one who didn’t know boundaries.

Maya and Ethan had been planning their wedding for months. At first, Nicole and Yvonne were supposed to be invited. But when Yvonne returned, the three of them had a fallout. Ethan was very gentle with them, but it got to the point where he left Nicole at a coffee shop after she declared that they were now “friends off.”

So Maya and Ethan proceeded with their wedding. It was private, with only a few family and friends invited. Now that the wedding is out, Nicole and Yvonne have been crying ever since. They even posted on social media about how they felt “neglected.”

I had been close with Nicole too, but she’s been too problematic after her breakup. At one time, she actually told Maya (back when they were still hanging out before the relationship) that she hoped my husband, Jordan (20M), wouldn’t cheat on me because he’s too young. I was offended by that as a wife. Jordan is a church leader inspite his age and he's been respectful toward Nicole all this time. It didn't sit right with me that she thought of Jordan that way. Recently, she also had issues with my biological sister’s boyfriend, Caleb (25M), who used to be her close male friend. She constantly nag Caleb and accused him of being a ""gaslighter"" and ""fake"" which are the qualities of her ex. Caleb, Nicole, and I were pretty much close before until I actually left the home church to be with my husband. Now, Caleb and I are the only one close because she is my sister's partner. Aside from the issues she had with Jordan and Caleb, she's been into different problems with different people as well.

We are all in a close-knit community, so it’s challenging to deal with all these overlapping relationships. But honestly, I feel like Nicole has been so entitled lately. I personally started to hate her a bit because of how she treated Maya and us as friends.

She even made a group chat, supposedly to “talk,” but not for reconciliation or to have a healthy discussion. She just wanted to defend her actions, which were clearly immature and disrespectful. She felt like we teamed up to hurt her or gossip about her, but that’s not the case. She’s just been so entitled that she completely ignored the boundaries of being a best friend. She JUST left the gc she made and posted on notes that ""I'm done, never again.""

So now I ask: are we the a-holes in this situation?

Anyway, best wishes to Maya and Ethan!",1,1759730473.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

* Paper: use cotton/linen blend or printable ""currency"" paper. If unavailable, lightly sand regular paper to remove gloss and add grain.
* Texture: emboss key areas or press the print on a hard textured surface to create subtle raised details. Use a light matte varnish to mimic the non-glossy feel.
* Detail: use high-resolution templates for correct proportions and fonts. Add foil-stamped seals or printed serials for realistic highlights. Avoid printing perfect full-color notes on both sides if you need to stay compliant.
* Age and distress: crumple, fold, and lightly stain with tea or coffee. Add small tears, creases, and edge wear, then let dry to keep texture. Light sanding on corners helps too.
* Finish and staging: trim precisely, stack neatly, and if doing close-ups place a real bill on top or bottom of the stack for added authenticity.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

1nzaw4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1nzaw4w/the_monster_in_waiting/,The Monster in Waiting,"Her mischievous smile flatlined as she realized he wasn't sitting at his desk as she'd presumed. With a slow lean she allowed her head to cross the threshold, bracing herself with both hands on the door frame as she peered in. Accepting that he wasn't there she began to pull back and barely caught sight of an arm as she was turning away.  She paused, holding her breath as she nervously took a step inside.  The arm was his, as she expected, but what she didn't expect was for him to be napping on the couch there.  As she surveyed him lying there so vulnerably her mischievous smile began to return.  She'd often daydreamed of such an opportunity, the two of them never spent time together outside of business.  Their connection seemed strong in the controlled setting, her imagination couldn't help but wonder what could evolve if they allowed themselves the freedom to explore.  She found her mischievous smile spreading as she glanced behind her, checking for evidence of any others that could possibly be there with them. Satisfied that they were alone she went to the front door and turned the latch on the lock. This late in the day she wasn't expecting anyone but she wasn't one for surprises, especially with what she had in mind.

Swiftly he unbuttoned his pants, the tension in the air rich of seduction his heart quickened in anticipation. Originally he'd had a different plan, allowing him to take lead of the encounter, using his dominance to instill a fearful insecurity and orchestrate her submission. But as she timidly entered the room he could already sense her fear, like a wolf looming over it's shivering prey.  Given the hunger he sensed from her, confirmed by the smirk on her face, he determined that whatever she was cooking up was worth sampling.  He was curious how she would approach him in this vulnerable state, how badly did she want him and how far would she go; hearing the front door latch only heightened his curiosity and further fueled his imagination.

The latch of the lock resonated in her ear like a hammer to steel. *Was she really doing this? What had come over her? Never before had she brazen such action, not with anyone lacking forbidden boundary.  What drove her to take such a risk now?* Perhaps it was the loss of control she had recently experienced in her personal life, the seemingly too soon, recent engagement of her ex.  Aware that the reason illuded her it had no effect in diminishing her desire. As she inched her way towards him her purse slid smoothly from her arm to the floor without a slip in her stride.  She came to pause once her body was flush with the foot end of the couch.  Peering down at him she felt her heart accelerate, the polished shoes on his feet shined exquisitely, a coffee brown leather with a squared toe. His pants matched his jacket flung on the chair behind him and still showed signs of a crease despite the time of the day. She noticed his button down shirt bore wrinkles where it had begun to come untucked and around his collar a deep maroon tie that was intentionally loosened, leaving the knot unevenly hung at his 2nd button.

His face seemed so peaceful, she almost thought she saw a smile begin to curve on one side.  She locked onto that perception, studying closely for any signs of movement, a flinch, a raise, a recession.  Doubting her eyes she slowly lifted her right hand in an attempt to test his consciousness.  Reaching towards his zipper she clasped it between her thumb and forefinger and realized for the first time his button was undone.  *Had it been like that the whole time?* Possible she could've overlooked it, her ravenous, lustful thoughts were consuming her attention.  She applied the slightest bit of pressure as she assisted in it's descent, allowing it to silently release one zipper tooth at a time, while watching his face intently for any signs of recognition. Before anything revealed itself she found her attention averted from his face to the bulge growing under her hand. With a mind of it's own it began stretching towards the freedom she released, raising the collar of his boxers in an attempt to escape.  The opening afront gave sight of his still relaxed balls, ginormously spread out like large resting breast.  Somehow instinctively she brought her lips to them, kissing them as softly as they were. She felt his shaft hardening as her hand helped to bring his balls through the opening to her craving mouth.

It was becoming nearly impossible to contain himself, with each lip lock her desire delivered with more intensity.

You name it — I’ve tried it. Fasting, keto, “only salads,” gym six days a week… and every single time, I’d burn out and end up right back where I started.

Then earlier this year, I decided to stop trying to do everything perfectly and just fix the things I was constantly messing up. And weirdly enough, that’s when it started working.

Here’s what actually made a difference for me:

1. **Sleep.** I used to think sleep didn’t matter. Turns out it’s everything. Once I started getting 7–8 hours consistently, my cravings dropped, my mood leveled out, and I stopped feeling like I needed sugar to survive.
2. **No more drinking calories.** Cutting out sodas, juices, and sugary coffee was a game-changer. Didn’t realize how much I was drinking my calories until I stopped.
3. **Walks after meals.** I didn’t run or hit the treadmill — I just walked. 10–15 minutes after each meal. It helped with digestion and kept my energy steady.
4. **Protein first.** I started eating my protein before anything else on the plate. It sounds silly, but it kept me full longer and stopped the late-night snacking habit.

None of this happened overnight. But 47 lbs later, I actually feel good in my own body — and for once, I’m not obsessing over food or numbers.

If you’re stuck, don’t overhaul everything. Fix one small thing you can actually stick with. That’s how it starts.",1,1759729178.0,WeightlossJourney,0,1.0,False
1nzau4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoLChampConcepts/comments/1nzau4o/meaning_of_human_civilization/,meaning of human civilization,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I don’t feel any chemistry with her. I don’t ‘like’ her in the sense I'm not physically attracted to her (which she has noted herself, evident in my lack of effort regarding intimacy and sex) and find her mannerisms and way of talking and acting off-putting. Our conversations seem forced. We don’t say “I love you” or hug or kiss. We hardly have a sex life, although she wants to. We’ve tried being sexual in the past but it never seemed to work.

It feels like we would be better suited to being friends than being married - something she has also said.

She knows all this but remains committed to the relationship and said she loves me.  She organises dates for us. We enjoy outings to cinemas, book shops, long drives to the beach. I feel safe with her. She is kind, warm-hearted, sense of humour, able to get along with most people. She keeps family ties and is close with her friends.

Having said that, when around her at home or at a restaurant or when in conversation, I imagine being married to someone else who I would be in the moment with, have chemistry with. (No one in particular, I am not having an affair.)

We both work. I do pretty much all the housework, grocery shopping, take her clothes to the dry cleaners, make trips to get her coffee and food (neither of us cook). I see all this as acts of service to make up for my lack of giving her intimacy.

I care about her but don’t seem to be ‘into her’ or ‘in love’ with her.

Adding to all this I have anxiety and depression issues, stuck on Olanzapine - 5mg. All this she has been very patient with.

I’ve thought about taking relationship counseling. But that won’t change her appearance or mannerisms. It feels like I have to force myself to be into her and like her, which seems exhausting and unnatural.

I am on the way to talking myself into getting a divorce, although I’ve being having anxiety and panic attacks every morning imagining being alone for the rest of my life. With all my mental health issues, I wouldn’t have the capacity to get married again, and perhaps nobody else would have the patience and understanding my wife has.

tl;dr

I don't feel chemistry with my wife, am not into her, or madly in love with her, after 9 years, and am not sure whether to stay married to her. ",3,1759728676.0,marriageadvice,2,1.0,False

here my Alexa main task is researcher (skill 5) but also good at cooking (skill 4) and my trainee chef Fatima (skill 0) i wanna rise her stat so food binge won't happen.  
so 1 create 2 stove, 1st stove for alexa cooking meal, another assign owner to fatima specially for brew tea/coffee. if your camp doesn't have it yet, you can get it at supply market.  
my goal fatima cooking stat rise to 2-3 and take over all cooking task so Alexa can focus research.  
1 hour cooking is enough for daily and drinking always good for removing bad mood.  
they cooking early at 5 and so alexa can continue her research, fatima can help farming and haul

Hi, I'm Kat 33, and only here to meet nice, real people who know how to converse. If you're a creep, looking for NSFW, or wanting me to solo the convo please don't. My back's already achy, I don't want osteoporosis from pulling the chat myself.

And don't text me if you're only gonna respond after 3, 4 or 24 hours. I'm not someone you can just respond to when it suits you. The coffee goes cold and no, I am not referring to the coffee ☕ Don't save it for later, 'cause I won't be around. If you want to be away, then stay away for good.
I understand that people get busy, and it's fine! But you can just be honest. ""Hey, can't talk right now"" is great. People get it,  it's communication, not sorcery.
If you lost interest, own up to it. Don't ghost and come back like a Wi-Fi connection. We're grown-ups ,  communicate, don't disappear. Ghosting isn't enigmatic, it's just emotionally lazy.

I enjoy hiking, cooking, reading, horror and nature adventure movies, and surfing. But let's stop here, 'cause we gotta have something to discuss later, right?

So yeah, message me only if you're consistent, funny, and use your words. I'm not here to babysit your comms problem. 😆🦦

A few weeks later he emailed me saying “it’s hard to ignore the heart” (even though when I tried to reconcile before (my own denial showing), he told me he’d “turned his heart off”). He also left a long handwritten letter hidden in my stuff. It’s full of nostalgic language, sweet future-talk (hikes, coffee dates, hosting me for dinner), and vague “I’ve grown” statements but zero real accountability. No mention of the lies, threats, or substance use. Just “we can both be stubborn” and “pride got in the way.”

I even found another note about how the US economy will crash in 2027, he’s buying land in Mexico, and I should come with him. This is from someone who doesn’t have a car, lied about finances, and has shown little follow-through.

My gut says this letter is self-centered and avoidant, designed to tug at my heart rather than own his behavior. But it’s emotionally confusing to read loving words after everything. With the distance I’m seeing how delusional he is and how much in denial I was I about the relationship. Like he actually thinks there’s a future…then again my threats of leaving were empty until I finally moved out.

eto mag bibigay ako ng mga ginawa niya sakin na pinatawad ko pa din siya kasi tangang tanga ako eh, akala ko ako na papakasalan eh.

1st. - aug - sept 2024 nag start yung class niya, syempre magkaiba na kami ng school so medyo ano ilang ako kasi i know he has wandering eyes. natapos naman yung month na okay. OCT 2024, pangalanan nalang natin ang girl na YK. etong si YK hiningi daw yung number niya, tas ako naman nag taka bakit naman niya ibibigay yung number niya, eh kaya nga may facebook at messenger para dun sila mag usap since it’s for “school purposes” lang daw. so nakipag away ako, ang ending ako nag sorry. 

2nd. - Oct 2024 ulit. pumunta siya sa bahay ng tropa niya and kasa kasama nila si YK since ka-circle daw ng friends niya si YK. syempre mag seselos talaga ako, girlfriend niya ko eh? atska hindi pa naman lumilipas sakin yung pag bigay niya ng number kay YK. ayan nakipag away na naman ako. sinabi ko hinanakit ko, muntik na nga kami mag hiwalay nung oct 2024 kasi halos araw araw yung away tas siya mag ssorry lang para matapos na yung away, hindi na napag uusapan ng maayos. kasi never niya naman binibigyan ng effort during may tampo o galit ako sa mga ginagawa niya. 

3rd. - NOV 2024. ETO KALAT SA SCHOOL AT SA KA CIRCLE NIYA NA MAY GF SIYA NA MAG 4YEARS NA HA. kasi nakakausap ko din yung ka circle niya pag pinapauwi na siya ng nanay nya, so matic alam din ni YK na may gf siya since iniistory din naman ako ng ex ko sa socials nya. nov 6 something, galing kami baguio ng fam ko and syempre binilhan ko sila ng pasalubong ng mom niya. pinapunta ko siya sa house (hindi ko matandaan kung nov 6 din yun basta around nov lang) para ibigay ko yung pasalubong, nung nag message na siya sakin na nasa labas na siya, bigla ako naka feel na parang need ko tignan phone niya, and dumeretso sa imessage. never ako nag tingin ng imess niya sa buong rs namin since sa messenger kami nag uusap. then boom nakita ko sa recently deleted yung convo nila ni YK. never ko makakalimutan na sabi nung girl sakanya na “so i’m like your melatonin?” and nag open up siya kay YK na madami siyang prob at hindi siya makatulog. tangina kasi sana pinicture-an ko muna HAHAHAHA bobo din eh. tas ayon na nga umiyak ako sa harap niya pero yung mukha niya “😐” ganyan lang. tas deny siya ng deny na sasabihin nya naman daw talaga sakin, tas tinanong ko siya kung kailan niya pa balak sabihin eh naka delete na nga. ang sabi nya, humahanap lang daw sya tyempo kasi alam niya naman daw na hindi ko magugustuhan yung usapan nila. EH TANGINA SELF AWARE NAMAN PALA SI GAGO PERO NAKIPAG USAP PA DIN AT DINELETE PA TALAGA. pero ang ending nyan pinatawad ko siya, sabi ko ayoko talaga kay YK. 

4th. - dec 1, may field trip kasi sila. dec 2 yon before sila mag ft. i gave him allowance pa para pang spend nya ng foods and all. dec 3 yun na yung day ng fieldtrip nila, wala daw signal sa pinuntahan nila so naki connect daw siya kay YK so meaning hindi niya talaga malayuan yung girl na yon, inask ko siya kung may friend ba siya na may signal yung sim para loadan ko nalang. ang sagot niya, “wag na gagastos ka pa” tas sabi ko “malamang eh ayaw ko nga makausap mo yang girl na yan” TAS AYON NAG AWAY NA NAMAN. ayaw kasi mag patinag ng ex ko pagdating sa girl na yon. ewan ko ba tanga tanga din ako eh. dec 4 wala pa din signal. so tinanggap ko nalang, nag libang ako sa school. si bading nag pagupit ng short hair AS IN SUPER SUPER SHORT LIKE NAKA APPLE CUT. dec 3 ng gabi nag chat siya, pinakita ko sakanya ang sabi nya “nag pagupit ka?” ay tangina obvious ba? tas sabi ko naman “oo hahahah” sabi niya “ganda” at ang sabi ko “di mo ba bet” sabi nya “bet” tas ayon di na nag chat ulit kasi wala na naman signal. dec 4 ng umaga wala chat syempre matic na sakin since wala nga signal pero alam ko na uwian na nila ng dec 4 galing fieldtrip so i patiently waited all day for him. nag upd siya kung ano ginawa nila then nag upd din siya na nasa byahe na sila. ginabi na sila ng uwi so i expected na mag papahinga siya sa bahay nya, eh hindi yun yung nangyari HAHAHAHAH dumeretso muna siya sa tropa nya at nag inom sila ng kaklase niya na may kasama din babae and shits. wala naman kaso sakin kung makikipag inuman siya with girls na cms niya din. nag expect lang ako na makakausap ko na siya kasi 2 days ko din siya hindi halos makausap ng tuloy tuloy. 
pero wala eh nag inom siya HAHAHAHAH

5th. - dec 5. pumunta ako sa bahay nila, kasi away kami nung 4 eh, ako na nag susuyo. pero wala, nag ccp lang siya at hind niya ako kinakausap. hanggang sa makatulog siya at umalis nako. sobrang tuliro ko non haahahhaaha kasi ni hindi manlang napag usapan ng personal yung naging away namin. hindi ako nakapag update sakanya na nakauwi nako, nakatulog ako sa sobrang pagod at iyak din ako ng iyak. nag chat siya na bakit hindi ko daw siya ginising nung uuwi nako, ang sabi ko nalang ayaw ko siya maistorbo. tas sumabog ako bigla, kasi tangina nakita ko ig niya finollow back nya si YK eh alam niya naman na nag seselos ako dun, sabi ko sakanya ano yun bakit ganon, ang sagot niya sakin “naka auto followback” POTA MAY GANON BA YUNG INSTAGRAM?? jusko so nadagdagan na naman galit ko, ako yung nag sorry. dec 5 ng 10 or 11 basta umabot din ng 12 usapan namin. nakipag break siya. SIYA. napagod na daw siya kasi puro away. gusto niya mag focus muna sa sarili niya. so ako walang choice tinanggap ko kahit ayaw ko putanginang yan mahal na mahal ko eh. dec 6 kami totally nag break since inabot kami ng madaling araw.

6th. - so ayon break na nga, dec 12. may life360 pa kasi kami non and sabi nya na closure nya nalang daw sakin yun. basta ganon dec 12 nakita ko pumunts siya sa mall sinundo ata yung si YK kasi malapit lang sa mall yung bahay ni YK. eh that day magkita kami bff ko. sinabi ko sakanya nandito din sa mall yung ex ko. so medyo stalker vibes kami kasi natripan namin hanapin. pero wala din namin nakita so, nag transfer kami sa ibang mall ng friend ko para dun nalang mag bond at kitain din ang bf nya. then nagulat aq pag tingin ko 360 nandun din siya sa Cinehan. NANONOOD NG MOANA POTANGINA. EH KAYA NGA DI AKO NANOOD NG MOANA TO WATCH IT WITH HIM KAHIT LIBRE KO PA SIYA. pero wala. so tinanggap ko nalang ulit. umuwi kami ng bff ko sa bahay namin. nag inom kami. then inistalk ko ig nung girl, nasa coffee shop sila kung saan ako yung naka discover ng coffee shop na yun at nag coffee shop din kami dun ng ex ko HAHAHAHAH tangina napakinabangan pa nila yung na discover ko na coffee shop. tas nakita ko story ng ex ko nandun din siya obviously and silang dalawa lang. so ako naman tong lasing na tinawagan ko siya na bakit ginagago niya ko. sabi nya wala silang something or sumshit. eh ayon tangina wala. 

i got the worst version of him so i build him for another girl.

so ang lesson learned: wag tatanga tanga katulad ko bye.

ps. madami din siya nagawang worst, and ako din halos gumasagot all the time ng dates namin. ako din bumili ng iphone nya HAHAHAHAHAHAH ok bye yun lang

Wanted to give a review because I am quite happy with the purchase and also very impressed with their customer support.

I got the whole set (basket, wooden tamper, funnel, pucks reen, spring) and the total cost was less than one Sworks basket. (I'm based in Singapore).

Quality-wise, i believe the other premium items are better as the Graph basket is rather light and thin, but it works wonderfully still. And for the price, I would say its worth for me—we'll see how it lasts down the road. 

Unfortunately, the tamper I received has a tiny dent on the base, and the funnel doesn't reach all the way down so grounds still get stuck at the top. I wrote in to Graph, and got a rather prompt reply from them, apologising. Saying that they were working on improving the design, they offered to refund me for the funnel and that they would send a new tamper.

These promises were kept and I've since received a new tamper (I even requested to get the new loaded tamper with a top up) and a refund.

Customer support aside, this new upgrade has been excellent, albeit a bit more tedious with the spring and all. But the coffee it produces is wonderful, I can cut down on the beans used as well.

Here's the Hybrid Architecture That Fixes It.,"Text-to-3D AI agents have a 40% failure rate. Learn the hybrid architecture pattern combining LLMs and deterministic code that top teams use to ship reliable 3D generation.

# Building Effective Text-to-3D AI Agents: A Hybrid Architecture Approach

## Why Text-to-3D AI Agents Are Breaking in Production

You ask for a ""simple chair"" and get a blob with four sticks. Sound familiar?

Text-to-3D systems are failing at a 40% rate in production environments, and the problem isn't what you think. It's not the model qualityit's that user intent gets lost in translation between natural language and geometric constraints.

### The Reality Gap: When Generated 3D Models Fail User Intent

Here's what actually happens: A user says ""create a modern coffee table."" Your LLM interprets ""modern"" as minimalist, generates parameters, and outputs a surface floating in space with no legs. Technically correct by some definition of minimalist. Completely useless.

The gap exists because LLMs understand semantics but have zero comprehension of physical constraints. They don't know that tables need structural support or that ""chair-height"" means something specific to human ergonomics.

### Current Architectures Can't Handle Multi-Step 3D Workflows

Most teams are using pure LLM approaches: text goes in, 3D model comes out. One shot. No validation.

This breaks immediately when users want iterations. ""Make it taller"" becomes a gambledoes the agent scale the entire object or just add height to legs? Does it preserve proportions? Check for intersecting geometry?

Single-pass architectures can't maintain context across edits, can't validate outputs against physical rules, and can't recover from geometric failures. You need something fundamentally different.

## The Hybrid Architecture Solution: Combining Deterministic and LLM Components

Here's what nobody tells you about text-to-3D agents: trying to make LLMs do everything is the fastest way to burn through your API budget while your users rage-quit.

The solution is splitting the work based on what each component actually does well.

### Where LLMs Excel: Intent Understanding and Creative Interpretation

LLMs are absolute monsters at parsing messy human requests. ""Make it look more futuristic"" or ""add some steampunk vibes""traditional code would choke on this. Your LLM layer should handle:

- Extracting design intent from vague prompts
- Mapping natural language to 3D parameters (style, proportions, detail level)
- Making creative decisions when specs are ambiguous

```python
# LLM extracts structured intent

prompt = ""make a sci-fi chair, kinda minimalist""
intent = llm.parse(prompt)  # {style: ""sci-fi"", furniture: ""chair"", aesthetic: ""minimalist""}
```

### Where Traditional Code Wins: Mesh Processing and Geometric Validation

But when it comes to actual geometry? LLMs will hallucinate vertices that break physics. Use deterministic code for:

- Mesh topology validation (no self-intersecting surfaces)
- Polygon count optimization
- UV mapping and texture coordinate generation
- File format conversion and export

The validation layer catches 80% of broken outputs before they hit production. You cannot afford to skip this.

### Layer 1: Intent Parser and Context Manager

Users never say what they actually mean. ""Make it look cooler"" could mean increase polygon count, adjust lighting normals, or completely reshape the geometry. Your intent parser needs to maintain conversation state across edits.

```python
context = {
  ""original_prompt"": ""fantasy sword"",
  ""edit_history"": [""sharper blade"", ""add gems""],
  ""model_state"": current_mesh_params
}
```

The LLM interprets ambiguous requests against this context, then outputs structured parametersnot raw mesh data. Feed it previous iterations so ""make it sharper"" doesn't restart from scratch.

### Layer 2: Validation Pipeline and Quality Control

This is where most implementations fail: they trust the LLM output blindly.

Your validation layer runs deterministic checks before rendering. Triangle count reasonable? Normals facing outward? No self-intersecting geometry? These aren't LLM jobsthey're assertion checks.

```python
if mesh.triangle_count > 100k: reduce_complexity()
if has_degenerate_faces(): auto_repair()
```

Catch garbage early. The LLM suggests creative changes; traditional code ensures they're physically valid. This separation is what makes hybrid architectures actually ship.

## Production Deployment: Handling Edge Cases and User Feedback Loops

### Real-Time Validation: Catching Bad Outputs Before Users See Them

You cannot afford to generate a 3D model with flipped normals or self-intersecting meshes and send it to users. Your validation layer needs to run synchronously before returning results:

```python
def validate_mesh(mesh):
    assert mesh.is_watertight() and mesh.vertex_count < 100000
    return mesh.self_intersection_check() == 0
```

Check topology, poly count, and material assignments in under 200ms. If validation fails, trigger an automatic retry with refined promptsdon't just error out.

The pattern: LLM generates  validator catches issues  feedback loop refines  user sees quality output. This cuts support tickets by 60% in our testing.

### Iterative Refinement: Building Conversation Memory for 3D Edits

Users don't think in single prompts. They iterate: ""make it taller,"" ""add more detail to the base,"" ""actually, make it shorter again.""

Without conversation memory, your agent treats each request as isolatedbreaking the entire workflow. Store the mesh state and modification history in context:

```python
context = {""original_mesh"": mesh_v1, ""edits"": [""height += 20%"", ""base_detail = high""]}
```

When the user says ""undo that,"" your agent knows exactly what ""that"" means. This is where agentic AI actually feels intelligent instead of frustratingly dumb.

We're a fun-loving married couple (FTM Trans Guy and Cis Female) looking to build a long-term, casual, open polyamorous relationship with a few amazing men. We are NOT looking for casual sex or FWB, and if that is all you want, please do not message us. We are only seeking respectful guys who want to casually date us both together and individually at the same time. Nobody is moving in with us, and nobody is getting married to us. We're a dedicated team ready to share our life and love with the right additions to our relationship, and we want guys who are excited to be adored equally by both of us.
We are both Demisexual and Pansexual. Being demisexual means our relationship is built like a good horror movie: lots of suspense and getting to know the characters before anyone gets naked. Building a deep emotional connection and best-friend foundation is required before anything physical is on the table. We move slow, and that's a non-negotiable.
A Little About Us:
Me (The FTM Guy): 39, 5'8"", average build with a few tattoos. I'm on SSI so I'm home all the time, I'm a horror movie buff, and a WWE fanatic (don't worry, I won't suplex you). I watch all movies, but horror is my favorite genre. I'm the primary communicator, easy-going, and I value deep emotional honesty. I had top surgery but still have my original, perfectly fully functional tight female pussy I was born with (and I'm keeping it!).
My Wife (The Cis Female): 35, 4'11"" 3/4, curvy/thick build, DDD breasts and tight pussy. She doesn't have any tattoos yet. She works full-time, loves Rom-Coms, TLC reality TV (a great sense of humor is required to survive that), and TikTok. She is warm, affectionate, enjoys thoughtful conversation, and is the planner of the family. She is the mother of our daughter.
Shared Loves: We both love Starbucks coffee and are obsessed with everything pumpkin spice!
Our Dream Guys & Key Requirements
We are looking for bisexual or open-minded men aged 27-49 who are:
Personality: Sweet, kind, respectful, patient, and funny (the total package).
Appearance: Athletic or muscular builds (the kind who can help us move furniture and still look good in a t-shirt) with short goatees or short beards (little to no grey). Tattoos are a bonus.
Relationship Status: Single preferred. If partnered, their partner must explicitly approve.
Experience: Previous poly experience or experience with FTM trans men is a plus, but an open mind is welcome.
Non-Negotiables: We don't want anyone who is easily jealous or possessive or tries to violate our privacy by grabbing our phones and looking through our private messages and pictures with other boyfriends or tries to control us and our relationships with other men.
Communication & Dating Dynamics
You Date Us Both: You date my wife and me casually at the same time. This includes three-person hangouts, plus one-on-one dates with each of us.
Sequential Dating: Only two boyfriends will be at our house at once. We date sequentially; if one of us is out on an overnight date, the other is home with our daughter.
Sex is One-on-One Only.
Time & Communication: We won't see you every day, maybe once or twice or more, depending on our availability and yours. Even though we won't see you every day, we send daily good morning messages and texts throughout the day, and send random cute pictures to you and hope you do the same thing. If daily communication bothers you, we aren't the couple for you.
Boundaries: Home & Daughter
We have a homeschooled teenage daughter who lives with us.
Privacy: Nudity (even in boxers) must be kept strictly to the bedroom and bathroom. No flash dancing in the living room.
Overnights: One boyfriend can stay overnight only if one of us is having a one-on-one overnight date with another boyfriend. One of us will always be home with our daughter and pets.
Substance Use: You are welcome to drink alcohol or smoke weed. Anything harder than weed is a deal-breaker. No drugs/partying around us or our daughter.
Our Vetting and Communication Process: The Love Gauntlet
Since my wife works full-time, I (the FTM trans guy) will be your first contact and primary gatekeeper.
Initial Contact (Reddit): We'll exchange basic info. You must attach a recent face and body picture in your first message. In your first message, please tell us what makes you one of our dream guys and confirm you are looking for the long-term, casual open poly relationship. (Saves us all time!)
Move to Snapchat: If the vibe is right, we move to Snapchat.
Wife Introduction: If I think you're genuinely attracted to both of us for the right reasons, I'll show my wife our chat. If she's interested, she will give you her Snapchat, and you two can talk one-on-one while you and I continue our individual conversations.
First Hangout: The Vibe Check: Once all three of us are comfortable online, we set up a first-time, non-sexual hangout. This is where we see if the online chemistry holds up in real life.
During the first hangout, you must show both of us equal attention. If you are touchy-feely, grabby, try to get sexual prematurely, or show unequal attention, we will end things there. Respect the pace, please!
If you feel like you could be a great fit for us, please do not send instant unsolicited nudes or only talk about sex. We won't reply to men who only want sex or only want my wife.
Instead, send us a message with the following:
Your age and location.
A little about yourself (hobbies, interests, personality, and what you're looking for).
Remember to tell us what makes you one of our dream guys and confirm you are looking for the long-term, casual open poly relationship.
We're excited to find someone to share our world with. Send us your best and let's see if we can make some magic (and maybe a coffee run) happen!",3,1759726450.0,LivingstonParishKink,0,1.0,False

So posting it here instead. The review might sound critical, but I think I need to be as honest as I can be here.

Review: I really wanted to like this place since I live close by. In fact I was quite excited for the opening, since we used to drive by quite often and the place looked stunning from outside. But unfortunately, now that I’ve tried it twice, the experience falls lower than flat. The first time I visited, it was their opening week. We ordered a cold chocolate and a matcha latte.

The service was chaotic, which I could excuse as “first-week soft launch jitters”. What really threw me off was watching oat milk being poured straight out of a regular grocery store carton, pre made cold chocolate poured from plastic bottles. Wasn’t this a “specialty” coffee place? Sure, most cafés source from regular suppliers, but there’s usually some finesse, presentation, and a bit of polish that makes it feel premium. At the least.

Here, everything was out in the open, and such mediocre practices just doesn’t justify a 450 rupee matcha. Since it’s a soft launch, this is probably excusable right? All the chaos and gaps in operations? Nope. Not when the drinks and everything in the menu is charged full prices from day one. If it was truly a “soft launch,” then prices should’ve reflected that (like say half-price). Maybe with a ‘tell us what you feel’ sort of a format, things would’ve felt different.

But charging full premium prices while asking customers to overlook chaos and poor execution feels ironic at best. Anyway, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and went back today. This time, I ordered the affogato and tamarind fizz. Honestly? The affogato was a disaster. It was downright depressing. The espresso wasn’t served separately, it was already poured in, and it wasn’t even warm. The portion felt so tiny, I almost had to double-check if I’d accidentally ordered from the kids’ menu.

This is was the worst Affogato I’ve had in Chennai, hands down. The tamarind fizz had almost no fizz at all, forgettable is what I can say. Yes, the space is beautiful; modern, sleek, and aesthetic. But that’s where the good ends. Service is clumsy, the drinks don’t justify the price tag, and worst of all, they sneak in a service charge upfront.

For a café where you order at the counter and seat yourself, that just feels wrong and sneaky. I saw reviews mentioning this weeks ago, and nothing seems to have changed.

Bottom line: Skip it. There are too many better places in Chennai offering better drinks, service, and value. While you might want to drop by for the aesthetics, I don’t think there’s much else to make you stay.",43,1759726355.0,Chennai,13,0.98,False

After trying the core 4 prescriptions I decided to stick with Vyvanse and have been taking it consistently for the last 6 months. One thing that's been bugging though, is that it feels like the Vyvanse wears off after lunch, making afternoons pretty much a wash and then evenings start to creep into anxiety mode. 

Well last Friday I had the idea to try a half cup of coffee around 1pm when the Vyvanse started to fade and WOW, it's been nothing short of amazing! It's like I'm 2 different people on the same day- in the morning I'm super focused and analytical and in the afternoon I'm energetic and creative. And of course the added benefits that I don't have the afternoon lull, anxiety kicks in much lighter/later, and I'm still managing to sleep pretty well. And of course, I have to be the ADHD cliche who comes in touting great success based on 3 good days!

I'd highly recommend to anyone who hasn't tried it! Also curious, does anyone else do this?

EVERY YEAR! for 11 years, and this entire time they’ve told me about how by the time im 30 my body is going to be wrecked, we all know the side effects. i just would never listen, i never wanted to accept that i was different from other kids i was ashamed of it. i never went to the nurse during school, i never took my pills, i rarely took my long acting insulin (exactly why id always be in the hospital) all this to say i just suck at diabetic management, but recently at the beginning of the year i was approved to get omnipod and it helped me so much. it made everything so much easier and recently i ran out of my pods and refilled my prescription but the pharmacy gave me the wrong pods so i couldn’t use them. and at this point i was just so burnt out i didn’t want to do diabetes anymore i took my dexcom off and i just existed. and i started feeling sick i lost my appetite and all i wanted to do was sleep, i knew exactly what it was i’ve been through this time and time again and i corrected myself w short acting insulin but i didn’t give my lantus and i was NOT checking my bs. all the while still eating and drinking any and everything. and so this week on monday i woke up and texted my best friend telling her i didn’t feel good, complaining about my headache that id had for days at this point and she suggested we went to get coffee and so we went. i don’t really remember this day honestly but she told me that while we were out i would just walk in front of her and mutter to myself and just say random phrases from the internet like i didn’t make sense at all. she said i looked like i was a zombie. i got home after this and went straight to sleep like i had done the entire day before that and i woke up in the middle of the night because i had to puke, i went to throw up and thought id be okay to go to bed but not even 10 minutes later i was up again stumbling to the restroom, next thing i know my mom busted in my restroom and found me passed out over the toilet, she rushed me to the hospital of course knowing exactly what had happened. she was so mad, she was so mad because she told me time and time again to check myself to get my meds that we would end up in the hospital but i just couldn’t do it. all i remember was getting to the hospital and i blacked out. i completely blacked out, i didn’t wake up for 2 days. while i was blacked out it was like i was on drugs, i ripped out my iv, i made no sense when i spoke, i was in diapers. when talking about me the drs would say i was the girl who liked to pull on her cords, i was basically in a coma, they told me i was talking sort of but that i was so confused i didn’t even know where i was, i wasn’t breathing correctly, i couldn’t control my bladder, i couldn’t walk. the doctors told my mom if she hadn’t found me right when she had i would’ve died. my brain was swelling my organs were shutting down, my blood sugar was 689 when they admitted me. i could’ve died, of course everytime this happened i could’ve died but it’s never been this bad, it’s honestly scared me straight, i don’t want to die. i don’t want this disease to be what kills me, im only 18 and my body is deteriorating. i just can’t believe that this happened and that i let it get so bad, Im so scared im so scared that it had ever lasting affects on my brain, my head still hurts and i’ve been feeling like my head is just light. it might be because of getting on my meds or getting on antidepressants but i don’t know, im just happy to be alive. after that i have an appreciation for life i never had before and i never want to go through that again

Superstar Anand's Karmachari REVEALS The One Secret That Forced Him To Run For His Life!,"For twenty long years, Prakash was more than just a 'karmachari' to Superstar Anand. He was his shadow, his confidant, the man who knew which coffee he drank and which secrets he kept. He was family. But today, Prakash is missing, and the heart-wrenching reason for his disappearance is sending shockwaves through Bollywood. The 20-year bond of trust has not just been broken; it has been shattered into a million pieces.

It all happened overnight. Prakash, the man who never took a day off, vanished without a trace. His phone is switched off, and his small home is empty. Whispers in the industry are growing louder with every passing hour. Why would the most loyal employee in B-town suddenly flee? What could he have possibly seen inside the superstar’s glittering, multi-crore mansion that would make him fear for his own life? The silence from Anand's camp is deafening, and it’s only adding fuel to the fire.

Sources close to Prakash's family are now leaking horrifying details. They speak of a tearful, cryptic message Prakash sent to his brother just before he disappeared. The message allegedly said, ""It was never about the money. It's about what I saw in the 'private study' that night. I can't live with this secret."" What was in this private study? Rumours hint at a mysterious red diary, illegal transactions, and a powerful political connection that Anand has desperately tried to hide from the world. Prakash, the simple karmachari, had accidentally stumbled upon a truth so dark, it could destroy the superstar’s entire empire.

Now, a storm is brewing. Superstar Anand’s perfect image is cracking, and the foundation of his career is shaking. Prakash held the key to all his secrets, and now that key is out in the open. The entire nation is holding its breath, waiting for Prakash to reveal the full story. But the most chilling question remains: will he be allowed to speak? Or has he been silenced forever? This isn't just a story of a karmachari's betrayal; it’s a story of a dark secret that could bring down one of India's biggest stars.",1,1759725984.0,TrendBharat,0,1.0,False

However I was able to scrape off much of this black stuff - is it possible to scrape off a cavity or is this just staining? I feel no pain and no abnormal sensitivity. Hygienist also pulled up my xrays from a year ago when I last saw the dentist and said I have bone loss but this was never mentioned to me by the dentist (however I don’t doubt this because I believe I could see it). This is kind of a moot point but maybe relevant lol 
No other hygienist has mentioned any of this to me. Dentist didn’t really express any concern last time I saw him either (last year). I have an appt booked in the coming week but just wondering if the hygienist could be wrong about the cavities?? 
I brush twice a day but admittedly don’t floss. I switched to a manual toothbrush when I moved for college but I have switched back to electric 😬 Also have started using mouthwash and flossing daily now. I also think the toothpaste I’ve been using for ~year did not contain fluoride (not sure it is in a foreign language) but I have switched to a toothpaste that 100% does now.

1nz9utr,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTraveling/comments/1nz9utr/popular_mansion_trolley_tours_in_newport/,Popular mansion trolley tours in Newport?,"Just got back from an incredible Newport trolley tour that I need to tell you all about. If you're planning a trip to Newport, Rhode Island, this is something you absolutely shouldn't miss.

I spent weeks researching different Newport tours and finally decided on the Viking Tours trolley tour that includes the Breakers Mansion. Looking back, it was definitely the right choice - here's why.

The tour starts at the Newport Gateway Center, which is super convenient if you're driving in (parking is pretty reasonable at $2 for the first half hour and $1.50 after that). I arrived about 20 minutes early, which gave me plenty of time to get oriented and grab a coffee nearby.

The trolley itself was clean and comfortable - not one of those rickety old things you might be picturing. Our guide was this incredibly knowledgeable local historian who managed to make three hours fly by with fascinating stories about Newport's gilded age, the famous mansions, and the town's maritime history.

The route takes you along Ocean Drive and Bellevue Avenue, where you'll see more incredible mansions than you can count. We passed by Jackie Kennedy's summer home, which was a highlight for many in our group. The coastal views along Ocean Drive are breathtaking - definitely bring your camera.

But the real star of the show is the Breakers Mansion tour. This place is mind-blowing - 70 rooms of pure gilded age extravagance. The audio tour (available in multiple languages) lets you go at your own pace, and you get plenty of time to explore both the mansion and the grounds.

What really impressed me was how well-organized everything was. The tour runs like clockwork, and at $45 per person, it's actually great value considering you get both the trolley tour and mansion admission. They also offer discounts for seniors and youth if you're traveling with family.

If you're interested in booking this tour (and I highly recommend you do), I found the best deals through this link: https://athomewave.com/Newport-Trolley. They offer free cancellation up to 24 hours before, which gave me peace of mind when booking.

Pro tips:
- Book at least two weeks ahead - these tours fill up fast
- Arrive 15 minutes early to ensure you get good seats
- Bring a light jacket (the ocean breeze can be chilly)
- Wear comfortable walking shoes for the mansion tour
- Consider going in the morning when it's less crowded

Overall, this Newport trolley tour exceeded my expectations. It's the perfect mix of sightseeing, history, and architecture, and it gives you a great overview of Newport that helps you plan the rest of your stay.

Has anyone else taken this tour? I'd love to hear about your experience in the comments!

ALEXANDER IS A PERFECTLY GOOD NAME. like i get it? is it because i'm a girl? like you hear a guy go by J or TJ and nobody questions it. and what if i did hate my full name? what if i didn’t want to share it then it would just be this awkwardness after that. it’s gotten to the point where i do get offended when people ask just because they can’t seem to take no for an answer when i tell them it’s JUST JAY! thankfully this doesn’t happen often but when boomers start arguing with me about my name it really makes me wonder why. i assume it’s because they’re very traditional and they might see me having a nickname as some sort of disrespect to my given family name or blah blah blah. in my opinion it’s disrespectful to insist on someone telling you their “full name” like a complete stranger just not taking no for an answer. this doesn’t happen with younger people. please share your stories so i don’t feel crazy",1,1759725435.0,u_Impossible-Wish-1323,0,1.0,False

I think I’m just deeply unlikable.,"I wrote a post a while back about being 36, feeling behind, and never really connecting with anyone. A lot of people were kind and encouraging (thank you so much !)which I appreciated. But I think it’s easier to be kind when you don’t actually know the person.

If I’m honest, imagine the most forgettable coworker, the one no one really clicks with. Or the relative people avoid during family gatherings. That’s me. Not because I’m mean (I’m not). I’m nice. But I’m also awkward. Quiet. Hyper-aware. I don’t say say much because I’m always overthinking what not to say.

I even tried reaching out to an old friend recently and messaged them to grab coffee, made the effort. But sitting there, I realized I don’t even know how to socialize anymore. The entire time I was hyper-fixated on whether I was being boring, scrambling through my mind for something interesting to say, and wondering what they were thinking about me. It’s like I’m stuck inside myself, unable to just be around another person.

And I’ve started to wonder if I’ve lost the ability to socialize at all. I don’t mean in a quirky “I’m introverted” kind of way. I mean I feel like I’m missing whatever instinct makes people naturally flow in conversation, build rapport, or just be liked.

I see it clearly: when I join group convos, people subtly withdraw. At work, I’ve never truly connected with anyone. Friends fade out. I get excluded, forgotten. In any given social situation, imagine the getting-picked-last-in-dodgeball scenario. 

People say, “Just get out there and practice.” But I already have. I pay attention. I read the cues. The cues tell me I’m a person others want to get away from. And it’s not just anxiety or insecurity talking. I see it happen, repeatedly.

I don’t think I need therapy. I don’t have a mystery to uncover. I know what’s wrong: I’m not articulate. I’m not witty. I’m not clever or funny. I’m not magnetic.
I’m just a nice person… who no one wants to talk to.

People say “you’re overthinking” when really, I feel like I’m just seeing clearly. I’m in a phase where I don’t even want to try socializing because I don’t see the point anymore.

I won't be going back to the stock basket anytime soon.,"I started using the IMS Big Bang filter basket (B62.52TFH25.5BB) last week and it has really made a difference in the shots the ES701 makes. I use predominantly medium dark to dark roasts and at the best grind settings I could find. Found by trail and error over several attempts and not using the grind assist. I was able to get consistently good shots at a grind size of 13 with the standard double-shot basket. Now my grind setting is down to 10 and the shots are very consistent at 40 grams out, I use a Strength setting of 2. 

The higher extraction I now get with the IMS basket is way better than the extractions I was getting from the Ninja basket. They are also closer to the 30 second timing than the standard basket. I was really surprised at the difference in extraction time and flavor. I did not expect that the basket was really going to make that big a difference!

Of course none of this would have been possible had I not taken the time to model the spacer/magnetic ring for the basket that Ninja uses for automagic basket selection. I did find out, though, that what you use to 3D print make more of a difference than I thought. PET-G is just too soft and is affected by the heat and downward pressure applied by the brew head gasket. When I print the spacer in PET-G I get to make about four double shots and then it is deformed enough by the sharp edge of the basket and no longer seals properly. Will be trying carbon fiber filled nylon filament next, to see if it holds up better.

So a better basket and a way to tell the machine what size the basket is is an upgrade that is well worth the cost of entry. At least as far as I am concerned. You can't pay me enough to go back to my old way of making my morning coffee or even the first way I used the Ninja Cafe Luxe.

I also brewed a few shots with the concave IMS basket. I really can't tell much, if any, taste difference between it and the Big Bang basket. It does make the stream coalesce faster if you really care about the look from a bottomless portafilter. My general feeling is that this is basically an aesthetic upgrade from the flat bottomed basket. I have been using them interchangeably. 

As I find more ways to make this a better automatic espresso machine I will try to post here. But overall, I am very happy with the machine and do not see all the issues others are having with theirs. I do sympathize with those having issues, I am just not one of them.

So now my morning setup is the Big Bang in the bottomless portafilter, a paper filter in the bottom of the basket, grind 18 grams of dark roast, tamp, place a thin puck screen, brew. It is almost always an Americano. ",3,1759725013.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,0,1.0,False

2. A 3-week transition plan to make it stick and avoid burnout




---

🕔 Your Ideal 5 AM Morning Routine (90 minutes)

5:00–5:10 AM – Gentle Wake-Up & Rehydration

Use a sunrise alarm light or calming sound (avoid jarring alarms).

Drink a full glass of water with electrolytes or lemon.

Avoid your phone except for music/podcast if used during routine.

Optional: quick cold water face splash or step outside for 1 min of sunlight (if possible).


5:10–5:35 AM – Movement / Exercise (25 min)

Choose something that wakes up your body but doesn’t drain you:

Mon/Wed/Fri: Strength or home workout

Tue/Thu: Light cardio or mobility/yoga

Weekend (optional): walk, hike, stretch


Keep it simple and enjoyable — consistency > intensity.


5:35–5:50 AM – Mindfulness & Breath (15 min)

5–10 min meditation (guided if needed via apps like Calm, Headspace, Insight Timer).

5 min journaling: gratitude list + 1 daily intention.

Example prompt: “Today I will show up as someone who ___.”



5:50–6:20 AM – Deep Focus Activity (30 min)

No phone, no email — this is your “growth” time.

Read a book (personal growth, business, or skill).

Learn something new or reflect on goals.

Could also be quiet creative time if that feels right.



6:20–6:30 AM – Cool Down & Prep for Day (10 min)

Quick shower or freshen up.

Visualize your workday: what 1–2 things matter most today?

Optional energizer: cold shower or 5 min of upbeat music/dancing.


6:30–6:45 AM – Healthy Breakfast (15 min)

Keep it light but protein-rich (smoothie, eggs, Greek yogurt, oats).

Eat mindfully — no screens.


6:45–7:30 AM – Get Ready for Work / Commute Prep (45 min)

You’ll now be calm, centered, and productive by the time you start your day.

🧭 3-Week Transition Plan (To Avoid Shock to Your System)

Week	Wake-Up Time	Goal	Focus

Week 1	6:30 AM	Move bedtime earlier by 15–30 min each night. Start light stretching + journaling after waking.	Focus on consistency of wake time, not perfection.
Week 2	6:00 AM	Add 10–15 min exercise + short meditation.	Start reducing screen use 1 hr before bed.
Week 3	5:30 AM → 5:00 AM	Introduce full routine in smaller chunks (movement + meditation + reading).	Keep weekends close to 5–5:30 AM too — don’t yo-yo.


Additional Tips for Success

Nighttime prep is everything:

Lay out clothes, fill water bottle, prep breakfast.

Treat your night routine as the “start” of your morning.


Accountability trick: put your alarm across the room or use an app like Alarmy that requires a photo or task to dismiss.

Anchor habit: tie your wake-up to something enjoyable (coffee ritual, music, sunrise view, etc.).

Don’t panic about setbacks: oversleeping once isn’t failure — get back on track that same night.

I have a three month update to share 😃

Starting weight 243

Current weight 229

Weight loss= 14pounds down

Within my first two weeks my provider and I decided that decreasing my dose to a half dose was the right thing for me. 

Over the last three months, I have taken 3, 1-2 week breaks due to travel, as well as a bout of not feeling well when I first started.

Number of workouts: 21

Total MD Cost: $600 - monthly weight visit with my primary a vitamin shot ($150) 

Prescription: $60 - monthly prescription is $18

During my works open enrollment I opened a health savings account to prepare financial for this.

Advantages: since I’m not hungry I really prioritize my nutrition that I’m taking in (protein and fat focused), I have energy to work out, I feel good, making lifestyle changes like meal prepping, I don’t feel bloated all the time,
I don’t think about food, I don’t feel like I’m “trying”; I feel weird about saying that but it doesn’t feel like I’m hyper focused on trying to lose weight or thinking about it all the time. 

Disadvantages: constipation! I’m pretty sure I have a hemorrhoid (I have an md visit schedule), when I’m not hydrated I have bad breath, coffee 😕

Food lifesavers: elite core power protein milk with decaf espresso shots over ice, taco meat, Thai chicken, egg and sausage strata, blts, smoothies, omelettes, Oikos protein yogurt and berries, chomp sticks, and sushi (my go to for eating out). 

I do get bored of eating very similar foods everyday…

Overall I feel good about my decision to start this medication and hoping to get to under 200 by the end of the year.

He is 23 and works on and off at some Olive Garden. My friend nicely asked me if I could rent him my spare room for a while till he found his own place or things got better between his family in which I agreed. 

At first nothing was out of the norm he’d stay in his lane and I’d stay in mine I’d notice he was gradually getting more and more comfortable wearing what he pleased around the house. The first time he made breakfast for me I watched as he put on his very own apron and brought some cooking utensils with him, he made us eggs with ham and French toast. I didn’t think much of it at first but I enjoyed the meal and his company.

I came home late one night from work to find he had left me a plate of food and a note that read “hope work was good, I made you a little something before you go to bed”. I thought it was a kind gesture I even thanked him the next morning, I went to shower and when I got ready and stepped into the kitchen I had a whole 3 course meal of fruits and oatmeal and eggs waiting for me. He had on limited clothing which I tried not starting as I ate and asked him if he needed help cleaning up in which he washed the dishes while I swept and mopped the floor.

On one of my days off I was watching a movie when he came in the living room dressed in a sundress freshly painted nails and toenails in a nice lavender color, he was barefoot and sat right next to me but with his feet on the coffee table so I could admire his freshly painted toes.

In this moment I really felt a little uncomfortable but In a good way. It was a little late so he asked if I wanted a snack and he proceeded to make us some popcorn and grab us some sodas. He sat back down opened my soda can and handed it to me. We continued to watch the movie when he placed his head on my shoulder. I let him be for a little until he readjusted and placed more of his weight on my shoulder. I couldn’t contain my curiosity and when I turned my head to face him he kissed me and I didn’t move away.

Fast forward about two months we’ve been sleeping together almost every night in my room together we’ve been out In public with him in full femboy attire we of course get looks but I feel good about us being out together and how my sweet by is around and with me. His mother came to visit on maybe a month ago she still seemed disappointed in his presence, she kept thanking me for allowing him to stay with me and how much she appreciates me having him stay over.

She pulled me aside and asked if he had been growing out of the cross dressing and if staying with me has helped him. I told her that he was doing good and seemed comfortable staying here. Little does she know he shares my bed each night…

My question is I’ve always been straight when should I come out and let my friend and apparently his mother  know that instead of him “growing out of it” I’ve become his keeper…",8,1759724925.0,feminineboys,16,1.0,False

« Now » 1 super automatic for our 4-5 coffee beverages a day (2 people working from home, in a rush between meetings lol). 

« In the future » 1 Decent espresso for more advanced espresso making when we have the time.

So for our « now » option, we are comparing the Gaggia Accademia and the Jura high-end lineup. Going full automatic means one-touch beverages are our go to. Mainly cappuccinos, lattes and americanos.

What we like/dislike from both (based on comments we’ve read online…

Gaggia Accademia

Like: design-wise its gorgeous, brew group coming out for cleaning, « coffee boost » adding a shot to any drinks (we had 18-20g coffee espressos for the last 4 years out of the Oracle) so it’s more comparable strength-wise, milk Carafe with auto-clean inside the handle is GENIUS. And many control parameters over each drink.

Dislike: seems like the drip tray has a design flaw, needing you to empty it after 4 regular drinks, or 2 XL. Milk temperature has become quite a subject in the forums, not sure what’s wrong though.

Jura Z10

Like: reputation around taste, reliability, dedicates customer support and technicians, syrup attachment for milk beverages. 

Dislike: having to manage a hose to clean every time to male yourself a cappuccino, fixed brew group meaning difficulty to deep clean the machine ourself (some reporting mold from grounds falling into the machine, even outside brew group that can be cleaned with tabs…).

Please help us make up our minds based on your experience, as those require a quite serious amount of money….

How those compares to the Oracle touch taste (uneven experience there lol)? 🥴

Are those comparable machines, even with the difference in price? We don’t mind cold brews, outside maybe for espresso martinis, twice a tear 🤷🏻‍♂️)

Thanks in advance espresso lovers!

For the past 2 years, I’ve been going back and forth between my Flair Pro 2 and cafés, dabbling with different types and roasts of beans on my Flair. Through continual practice with the Flair Pro, I make good, consistent espressos and I’m quite happy with my setup. I have a nice electric grinder, and the handling of the Flair Pro 2 hasn’t been annoying for me — at least in my use case.

Now, if budget isn’t a concern, would investing in a La Marzocco Linea Micra be worth it? Working with my Flair Pro 2 in the mornings is almost meditative and ritualistic, so I really don’t mind the manual process of it all, and I make a very delicious espresso that I’m proud of. Owning an automatic espresso maker would definitely make things easier, simpler, and faster, but does it actually give you a better cup of coffee at the end of the day — which is what matters to me.",1,1759724649.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Its easy to overlook them but they remind me that peace doesnt have to be loud What small things are you grateful for today",7,1759724534.0,gratitude,0,1.0,False
