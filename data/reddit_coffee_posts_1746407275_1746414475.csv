1kf1o16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1kf1o16/do_i_have_an_sti_or_infection_on_my_tongue_i_dont/,Do I have an STI or infection on my tongue? I don't know if it's worth seeing a doctor over.,"30 female. No medical conditions. Take cymbalta for anxiety. I've lost a lot of weight, so I don't have my current weight. 

I feel kind of stupid worrying about this, but it hurts a ton. Two days ago I noticed my tongue was very sore. Looked at it later it the mirror and there were a couple pus-filled things right where I felt the pain of a lump inside my tongue. There are a few hard lumps in my tongue and then today when I looked because it hurt so much I can see it's kind of swollen in those spots. There's cracks (I guess that's the best description) that have pus in them and then a lot of white bumps on top that hurt. The problem is, I don't know if those cracks are always there, and if the white bumps are just inflamed tastebuds. My tongue is covered in a lot of white right now. Eating certain foods stings too much. My mouth tastes bad sometimes with it. Right now, it is sore and feels sort of burned, like of I drank coffee that was way too hot. My throat hurt a lot of the day today, but it's fine now. 

I am worried it's an infection, but I also feel silly getting worked up over what could be nothing. I don't know if this is worth going to the doctor.

I also wanted to ask if it's possible it could be an STI in my mouth? My husband left me, and we sometimes hook up. He said he hasn't been with anyone, but I think that's bullshit and I'm worried that it's an STI. But my anxiety makes it hard for me to know what worries are valid, especially since I am not a doctor. ",1,1746414351.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

26 M from North york and work downtown as a store manager. Looking to make a true connection life has been lonely I am open to anyone that reaches out :)

I suck at talking about myself so here it goes…

Interests: I like to workout, photography, fashion, watch anime and I love to cook I’ll cook for you lol and I’m a coffee enthusiast. I also cut hair 

Personality wise I’m pretty introverted but if I really like you I’ll be the most extroverted introvert you’ll meet. I do have strong morals and values I stand by, I don’t drink or smoke and I’m not really into any of that but I’m not against it ultimately. I truly believe in getting to no someone I don’t just want to have sex right away if that’s a dealbreaker I understand but I just can’t have sex with someone a week into knowing them.

appearance wise I’m mixed a very light lightskin lol with curly hair and facial hair. 6’1 with an athletic build. I am open to all ethnicities but I would be nice to connect with someone with an ethnic background.

Now, few of them can make coffee themselves, following the end-to-end workflow guided by me. After this, we will have so many variety of specialty beans, hehe.

I have improved a lot but the one big hang up is my coffee

I like a double shot in the dark. I have the Fellow Aiden for a pourover that is fairly automatic and can be pre-programmed with minimal clean up and a great cup

I am looking for a super auto to make the double espresso with frothed milk so that I can wake up to coffee at the push of a button with minimal maintenance and clean up. Thus far research has suggested Jura Z10. My present model gives me a pourover that is fantastic but no espresso so I end up Ubering coffee to my house to start my grind

This is one of the biggest challenges of my depression. Having that first cup ready allows me to do so much more. I do not have anybody who can make me a coffee at home for help. My doctor has said that if Ubering coffee helps me function and survive the rest of my day this is a worthwhile tradeoff but I am sure there are better options here

Thanks for helping

1kf1hup,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1kf1hup/six_months_great_sex_real_feelings_until_she/,"Six Months, Great Sex, Real Feelings… Until She Asked for One Last Advance","About 7 months ago, I met Sofia on SA. I was just coming out of a situationship and had a few prior experiences with sugar arrangements while traveling. I was 32, she was 27, and we met in a major metropolitan city. Over drinks at a bar, we hit it off—great conversation, natural chemistry. Not long after, she proposed a PPM arrangement, and we began what would become a steady sugar relationship.

From the start, the physical chemistry was undeniable. We’d go 2–4 rounds a night depending on the mood, and both of our needs were more than met. To be honest, the PPM she requested felt modest given the dynamic. We met about once a week, kept things simple—no drama, no alcohol, just great sex. Occasionally, she’d ask for an advance: once when she traveled abroad, once when I had to cancel. I always obliged.

Our time together was fun and easy. She'd come over, we'd hook up, laugh, and unwind. Over time, I learned bits about her culture. I especially appreciated when she introduced me to a foreign film from her country—it was a small gesture, but it stuck with me.

Things began to shift slightly. Before the holidays, she slept over for the first time as a kind of “special occasion.” In January, we went to a concert together—she even met some of my friends. She surprised me by showing up to cheer at the finish line when I ran a half marathon. Then came Valentine’s Day. We spent it together, and she casually mentioned she didn’t see us ending up together. I told her I hadn’t ruled anything out, and that maybe we could explore a real relationship. Through some miscommunication, she thought we *were* now boyfriend and girlfriend, and added me on social media for the first time. At the end of the night, I clarified the misunderstanding—she stormed out and unfriended me.

I texted her, apologized, and said we were still just getting to know each other. Surprisingly, that didn’t end things. Our arrangement continued, but with more variety—we started doing non-sexual things like beach days, park strolls, even a dance social. She helped me pack the day before a big trip to Argentina. If we didn’t hook up, she never asked for anything. We binged *White Lotus* together, and during that time, she brought a surprising sense of calm into my life.

While I was in Argentina (about six weeks ago), I realized I had real feelings for her—this wasn’t just a casual hookup anymore. When I got back, she was dealing with a visa issue in Mexico. Before she left, we watched the *White Lotus*finale together and talked seriously. I told her what I had been thinking during my trip—that I wanted to explore something real with her. She said she’d want to spend more time together too, but still needed financial support. I asked if getting a two-bedroom condo and having her move in would be enough support. She said yes.

The night before she left, she invited me to her place to say goodbye. For the first time, we hooked up at *her* apartment—and I didn’t pay her. It felt... different. We made plans for me to visit her in Mexico, and a few weeks later, I did. We explored Monterrey together. I paid for the hotel and meals, but she covered her own travel from Mexico City. We had a lot of sex but didn’t talk about the relationship dynamic. It was fun, but a bit unspoken.

Ten days after she returned to my country, she texted me saying she was back and excited to see me. Then came the request—she had overspent and needed an advance. I said I was excited to see her too, but wanted things to feel real, not transactional. She agreed in principle, said she wanted that too and hoped we could talk... but circled back to the money.

That’s when I realized I had to step back. I told her I was looking for something genuine. She wished me the best and deleted my contact. A few days later, I reached out to see if she wanted to meet for coffee. She politely declined. I assume she already lined up someone new.

Looking back, I genuinely enjoyed my time with her. I miss her. It’s jarring how quickly the mask came off, though. Part of me wishes we had just kept it simple—hookup buddies with no confusion. But maybe that would have just delayed the inevitable while I stayed stuck, still without a real girlfriend.

One lesson stands out: never propose going vanilla with a sugar baby unless you’re ready to lose *everything* that made the arrangement work.",0,1746413773.0,sugarlifestyleforum,7,0.43,False
1kf1hgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1kf1hgf/cuckold_to_be_part_2_femdom_humiliation_chastity/,"Cuckold to be. Part 2. [Femdom, humiliation, chastity, feminization]","This story is a continuation if a story I previously published.  This story will contain, hotwife, cuckold, ballbusting, female domination and some forced feminization.

I awoke with a bit of a start, but definitely groggy.  I open my eyes and see my Mistress/wife standing there radiant and sexy as hell.  She looks flush like she had just had a vigorous work out (nothing new for her) and is absolutely glowing and wearing a very pleased with herself smile on her face.  She is also wearing workout clothes that she had worn in a very sexy photo shoot she did at a friend's gym after hours.  She has on some very cheeky bottoms, that do more to reveal and frame her perfectly round and firm ass than to cover or contain it. The bright red shorts look great with her long red hair that is braided in pigtails and the white sports bra, that is doing very little other than covering her nipples and framing and pushing up her ample cleavage to form the most perfect atheletic cleavage known to man.  As I looked closely her eye makeup was in tact and she might have had lipstick on recently, but it is definitely smeared off now.  

She is standing next to a tall blonde woman of obvious German or eastern European decent.  This woman is dressed in the uniform of the hotel and stands easily 6'2"" and is just thick in all of her proportions.    She is not attractive nor unattractice in the face.  She looks like she is in her 30s.  

Kate, my wife, introduces Helga as the lead masseuse for the hotel.  She said that she thanked me for reserving a massage for her this morning, but after talking over coffee what my wife had planned, Helga proposed that I recieve a day full of her and her mate's in the spa attention.  

I recognize during her talk that i am naked.  Naked and tied down to the bed.  Spread eagle.  I feel my caged cock try to rouse, but its cage limits its movement.

My wife, seeing my eyes roam to assess my predicament, reaches for the sheet that is covering me and pulls it back exposing me to Helga.  

She continues, ""So dear, you are going to be the lucky recipient of Helga and her teams full service.  You will get a deep tissue massage, and I have asked her to focus on your genitals as they will be sore from last night.  You will also be given a high colonic, and even a full body wax.  You are hers today.  Completely.  She will be your key holder today.""  Kate removes the key around her neck and puts it around Helgas neck. ""You will do whatever she says.  And to reinforce your submission to me and her you will remain naked, caged, and plugged.""

""What will I be doing?  Well after meeting a few of the guys we saw yesterday at the pool for a morning workout in the fitness center for a vigorous workout, I was invited back to Daniels room for a protein shake.  He said he makes the best around, and he was not lying.   I am off to see a bit of the city with Jake and Chad and will hopefully grab some lunch before we all meet down at the pool.  Apparently the Saturday pool scene is pretty wild and adventurous.  We can meet then if you are up for it."" 

She turned to Helga ""I want you you to feel comfortable with a couple of key things:  1) He is a great pussy licker and you should feel free to use his face as often as you like and so should your crew in the spa."" My wife pulls down her bottoms and straddles my face and lowers herself to reinforce the sense of feeling comfortable.  ""Second, my cucky is a little pain and humiliation slut.  So there is more cash for humiliating him, but his balls should not go with out your best and most aggressive techniques.  Do your best and worst and dont let him fool you.  I have kicked him full force many times and stood on his little nuts and they are tough as nails.  He is not but they are.  Third, be flexible as you know plans evolve.  I do want to say thank you for this."" 

With that she begins to rock back and forth grinding her very wet pussy across my face and over my mouth.  I am licking and sucking for all I am worth and fairly suspicious that I am tasting Daniel's protein shake and that it is 'cream pie' flavored.  Kate reaches down and squeezes my balls and helps Helga establish her grip.  Soon Helga is wrenching my poor bruised balls while I lick and groan into my wifes (possibly well fucked pussy).  Kate cums and my face recieves a sizeable deposit of juice and cream on it.  Kate stands up and invites Helga to take her seat and thanks her for making me scream into her wet cunt as it made her cum so hard.  (My bollocks were not thanking her as her grip was that of a machinist, and I was sure that my left nut had been destroyed, only to have her adjust her grip and squeeze it differently and to find out there are higher levels of pain.) 

Helga wiggles out of the bottom half of her uniform, leggings and a pair of full bottom panties.  I see a trimmed snatch and darkness as she moves to straddle my head and reaffirm her grip on my tender balls.  She squeezes and mounts my face, she is much thicker than my wife and breathing will become an issue.  I hear Kate close the door to the bathroom as she goes to take a shower and am lost for the next 30 minutes as I lap at Helgas oversized clit and lips as she grips and mangles my tinder and now swollen balls.  

I am finally allowed to breathe as Helga collapses next to my prone and panting body.  I see Kate blow through, showered, fixed and ready for her lunch dates.  She is wearing a tiny tennis skirt that bounces around her round bottom, a half shirt tank top that shows her ample cleavage and her erect nipples as she is not wearing a bra.  She always wears matching bra and panties.  She comes over to me, kisses my forehead, and then spins around showing me under her skirt. Her panties match her bra and like the old joke says, the drapes are natural ginger, but the floor is brazilian.  

She bring something tiny down to my face.  She asks me if I know what this is.  As my eyes focus, I see it is the pink plastic 'nub' chastity cage.  A year ago on this trip when this day seemed impossibly far away, I remarked that ""she could put me in this tiny cage (its less than an inch long and makes my dick disappear) when she decides to cuckold me and I will wear it, in public to the hotel pool, and not take it off until I am allowed access to her pussy again.""  She recites to me those exact words and says her pussy is off limits to my now inadequate cock, and my inadequate cock is now banished to the nub.  She tosses it to Helga and asks her to put it on me when she waxes me down there.  

She picks up her bag and sunglasses and heads out in her high heeled sneakers that really make her ass look good and will make everyman wonder if she is wearing panties.  She heads out the door to be seen by men, to be near men and most likely to experience younger men.

I am left naked, caged, tied to a bed and awaiting the days activities.  

Helga rouses and says 'Lets go down zee stairs to the spa and specifically to my table.  I think you will like what I have planned for you.'  She puts back on her pants and then unties me and lets me use the restroom and wash my face ( it was covered in pussy juice, and maybe Daniel's 'protein shake.')

I come out in my bathrobe and she tells me ""no"".  She removes my bathrobe but does allow me to carry a wash cloth in my hands that are crossed in front of my waist and covering parts of my caged cock and balls.  I am led to the service elevator at the far end of the hall.  We pass a couple and a pair of 20 somethjng girls already drunk and on their way to the pool.  I soon find myself nude, caged and squished against the wall by a laundry cart as a pair of cleaning ladies as Helga about why my cock is so small and caged and why I am naked.  I am led through the service entrance of the spa, past a pair of workers on their break who stop to gawk at my nudity and soon in Helgas massage room.  

She has me crawl onto her table and for the next 90 minutes she pummels all of my major muscle groups leaving me relaxed and sore.  My balls also get similar treatment as the tense muscles in my shoulders, heavy kneading and lots of strong gripping and rubbing.  Needless to say I could have said 'fuck' from the pain for the entire 90 minutes.  

Soon i am on my feet and off to the next station.  My high colonic.  I am put on a table face down and am give a series of enemas to 'cleanse me'.  

Next I am off to be waxed.  Like everywhere.  ""Especially there"", I am told.  I spend the next 2 hours screaming and imbibing liquor to relax.  Soon I am pronounced baby smooth. Balls, cock, ass, arms, arm pits and legs and back and yes everywhere is smooth.  

During my massage, Helga removed my ""normal"" cock cage.  One that Kate and I had been experiementing with.  And now she is back. I am still in what could be an Ob/Gyn's office with the stirrups.  And my arms are bound behind my back.  Helga comes in with a bowl of ice water.  She dips my cock and balls in it and both shrink up within minutes.  Next she takes some silocone lubricant and slathers up my cock and balls.  Then she threads my shriveled cold penis into the tiny opening, and my balls through the smallest of the available rings.  Soon my shriveled manhood is enshrined in pink sissy plastic and locked away.  

This feeling and its implication gets to me.  Like kind of swirling in the twin feelings of being in a smaller and long term chastity and the sense that complete strangers are getting access to what had been my pussy.  My exclusive use pussy. My hot wife's pussy.  Or more concisely, my hotwife's pussy.  Its not mine anymore.  I may get to lick it.  I may get to see it.  But fucking it, feeling its tight velvety embrace.  That is for younger and more fit men.  Not chaste, cucks who like their balls busted and have sissy tendencies.

In all of my head swirl, i did not notice that I had been moved to the nail salon.  Here i am in what could easily be a room of 10 women, and I am naked, except for my cage, getting my finger nails and toe nails painted... pink to match my cage.  Awesome.  I begin to recoil just as Helga walks up behind me and puts my wife on the phone up to my ear.  ""I just had the best time at lunch, Jake and Chad were surpisingly suoer fun to hang out with.  I have never felt so full. Sure they are quintessential fuckboys but anyway.  They loved hearing about you and may find you later for some additional training.  Anyway, i am changing and about to head to the pool.  Ill text you a pic once I settle on an outfit.  I think my binkinis may be too boring, and I dont want to be boring anymore. Enjoy your time at the spa, ill send you a pic with what I decide.""

She talks to Helga a few minutes more. I do not notice but a few women, dressed in comfy robes come in.  They do not recoil in horror at my nudity but rather seem intrigued and Helga stops by to explain.  Soon I am asked to model my micro chastity cage.  One of the women remarks that this is perfect revenge for having to wear a micro bikini.  ""Good for your wife.""

I am then escorted to another room.  Its ver relaxing with calming music and dim lightting. My arms are bound to the arms of the chair and my ankles to the the feet of the plush chair.  I am given cucumber slices to cover my eye lids held in place by a mask. I can feel more people enter the small space and i hear the mistakeable sound of one maybe two men stroking.  A firm strong hand grabs my visible balls and begins to squeeze.  The other pushes my head back so that i would be looking straight up at the ceiling.  I hear the stroking pick up pace and two different voices grunt.  My mask is ripped off in time to see a black dick and a white dick being stroked over my face. I manage to close my eyes just in time for the anglo first then the afro dick explode and shoot ribbons of hot cum all over my face.  I am held there by Helga's strong grip on my chin and my balls.  She has has gripped and stretched my balls and held them close together and then planted her strong knee right on top of them as she places her body weight on my testicles.   The men above me continue to drain their cocks onto my face.  Eventually, my nose is covered and i have to open my mouth to breathe.  One of the cocks begins to trace along my lips.  I absent-mindedly trace my tongue along the head and and open up my mouth first to breathe and then to accommodate the thick cock, tasting the end of his orgasm.  I suck the tip and take the entire tip into my mouth.  

Here I am, bound to a comfortable chair, head pushed back by my wife's gargantuan assisstant who has also planted her knee and her considerable heft right on my balls.  Two dudes have just glazed my face with loads of cum and now I am sucking a dick.  I feel the weight shift Helga's grip on me is released as I continue to suckle the cock that should be softening in my mouth.  I feel the cock move from the side of my face and his feet move to stand on the arms of the chair.  He grabs the sides of my head and he eases his still hard cock into my mouth and he begins to fuck my mouth then my throat. His cock gaining access in part due to the amount of training I have been given and due to the amount of cum I have already sucked out of his cock. He stands over me and really starts fucking my throat pinning my head down and bouncing his balls off my chin.  I concentrate on swallowing his cock and finding ways to breathe.  I open my eyes enough to realize it was the black cock and also to realize that Helga is filming my debasement.  I hear her talk into the camera, ""After a relaxing day at the spa, with a massage, colonic and mani - pedi, I arranged for your husband to recieve a facial.  Now it looks like he is being given a deep tissue massage and throat stretching from our in house trainer, Daniel.""

""Is the taste familiar to you, little cocksucker?"" Daniel said grinning down at me, his defined arms, chiseled chest and perfect teeth mocking my soft submissive self.  He picks up the pace and his cock hardens and really begins to stretch my jaw and work the back of my throat.  ""Your wife was right, you are a natural cock sucker.  She is a beautiful woman, with a tight body and a very tight pussy.  You should have heard her moan when I split her open with my cock. But of course she is tight, if the only thing she had inside her was your pathetic dicklet."" He throws his muscular thigh over my shoulder, further asserting his dominance.  Looking down in my cum covered face, ""You are not enough of a man for her, you are hardly a man at all.  With that he grabs my chin, tilts my head back and proceeds to crawl up on my face, dipping his shaved black balls in my mouth.  I suck dutifully, he takes the phone from Helga and films me up close and personal, sucking his scrotum, probably still coated in my wifes juices, contentedly.  He continues to berate me, ""Your wife has finally seen the light, she has deciced to live a life for her.  Your life will be very different, and as submissive as you are... ""  He positions himself so that his asshole is right over my mouth, spreads his firm cheeks and lowers his puckered hole down to my mouth.  His huge balls are covering my nose and his hard slimy cock lays on my forehead.  He commands me to "" lick his ass then to 'tongue-fuck it."" I respond in a trance and do exactly as he says burying my tongue in his ass hole and moving it in and out. He strokes his cock above me.  I hear laughter from Helga and my wife who is watching my humiliation via facetime.  Eventually i am allowed to breathe.  I feel my arms and legs being released.  I am told to stand and put my face close to the seat of the chair, spread my legs and keep my legs straight.  Helga places the phone on facetime on the seat.  My wife/mistress gets her first look at me.  My face is covered in jizz. My mouth now tastes like Daniels ass hole and further my humiliation ... unnnnnggggg.... Daniel is penetrating my ass with his thick cock.   And my wife gets to watch my facial expressions real time.  Daniel takes his time, enjoying my humiliation.  Once fully inside me, he makes me ask for permission to be fucked by his Dick from my Mistress and then beg for his big black Master cock.  He makes sure that I recognize his cock as my Master.  Soon I am panting like a bitch in heat as my Master fucks me so good.  He has control of my hips slamming his meat into my hungry ass then as he gets close to cumming, he has me lean back and maintain my grip on the chair.  He grabs my hair and wrenches my face around to his and has me beg for his cum from Master cock.  I beg as Helga films the whole thing part amused, part aroused and part finding my submission and humiliation hilarious.  He pulls my head straight back and puts his his fingers in my mouth, 'fish hooking' me, as he continues to fuck me deep and hard.  My back is arched and I am staring at the ceiling, totally submitted to and enraptured by the power of this Alpha that earlier had fucked my wife.  I feel Master flex deep in my ass hole and his balls have stopped slapping against my taint as Master pulses then shoots rope after rope of hot cum deep in my guts.  My clitty would be hard in its micro cage, if it could get hard.  But instead I am left leaking.  His hands move out of my mouth as he just wraps one around my neck and chokes me as he drains his cock in my ass.  His other hand finds my balls and squeezes them and pulls them down as he commands me to my knees.  Soon his cock is back in my mouth as I suck him dry and clean his cock from my ass, which was very clean due to the set of enemas I had taken earlier.  He tells me to keep the last bit in my mouth as he pulls out grabs his shorts and walks out of the room, his big semi hard dick swinging to his thighs as he walked.  I am left a sweaty cum covered and well fucked wreck.  

I look around as I regain my senses.  Helga is approaching with a bundle of something in her hands....

FD1 – “Alex”
Nickname from cast & crew: Alex (after Alex Browning)
FD5 uses it in quiet, emotional moments. FD2 uses it only when scolding. FD4 uses it when trying to freak him out.
•FD5: “Breathe, Alex. Just breathe. I’ve got you.”
•FD2: “Alex, stop taping knives to the TV remote again!”
•FD4: “Alex, wanna help me break into a crematorium for science?”
Gets mad comforted when anyone calls him “Alex” because it makes him feel real.

FD2 – “Kim”
Nickname from cast & crew: Kim (after Kimberly Corman)
She insists on it during shoots—“Call me Kim or I walk.” Only FD3 calls her “Kimmy” and somehow survives.
•FD3: “Hey, Kimmy, you still have yarn and newspaper clippings in your hair.”
•FD2: “Don’t test me. I will rearrange your spinal cord.”
She signs emails as “Kim.” Her trailer has a plaque.

FD3 – “Wendy”
Nickname from cast & crew: Wendy (after Wendy Christensen)
FD4 exclusively calls her Wendy. FD2 does too, usually while holding painkillers.
•FD4: “Wendy, babe, can you crack my back again? Preferably with your thighs.”
•FD2: “Wendy, how long since your last chiropractor visit?”
•FD6: “Is it true you can sense death through your spine?”
FD3 accepts “Wendy” but only lets people she likes say it. Anyone else gets a punch.


FD4 – “Nick”
Nickname from cast & crew: Nick (after Nick O’Bannon)
Everyone says it sarcastically, mock-hero style.
•FD2: “Nick, put your shirt back on. This is Costco.”
•FD3: “Nick, stop oiling your chest in my mirror.”
•FD1: “Nick, stop whispering ‘I saved you’ into the coffee pot.”
FD4 thinks he’s the main character on and off set. No one has the heart to tell him otherwise (except FD3. Daily.)


FD5 – “Sam”
Nickname from cast & crew: Sam (after Sam Lawton)
FD1 lives for calling him this in soft, broken voices.
•FD1: “Sam… do you think it ever really ends?”
•FD4: “Sammy-boy, you still got those pancakes from craft services?”

FD6 tried calling him “Sammy” once and FD5 just slowly turned his head like a possessed marionette.

I’m a coffee-loving creative on the east coast of Florida who values depth, humor, and emotional honesty. Faith is a daily part of my life, not just Sundays, but something that grounds me and helps shape how I treat people and myself. I grew up Seventh-day Adventist, walked through a season in Messianic faith, and now find myself aligned with non-denominational Christianity, walking closely with God and seeking someone who gets that.

I’m in a season of growth—spiritually, emotionally, and creatively. I share my home with people I love and a few lovable pets. I have two small tattoos (if that’s a dealbreaker, I understand), and I’m always seeking to become more grounded, healed, and whole. Growth, in every sense, is part of my rhythm. I care deeply about emotional depth, discernment, and gentleness paired with strength. Accountability and self-awareness matter to me, as does a steady pursuit of peace, purpose, and alignment with God.

Family is incredibly important to me, and while I live in a close-knit home now, I hope to start my own someday. I’ve been through enough to know what I don’t want, but I haven’t let that make me hard. 

Vulnerable? Yes. 
Bitter? No. 
Healing and hopeful? Absolutely💕

I’m looking for a man who leads with humility, lives with integrity, and loves with intention. Someone emotionally safe, spiritually grounded, and secure in who he is—not intimidated by a strong woman, but excited to have one build beside him. If you’re someone who talks to God more than you talk about Him, who values growth, family, and laughter, I’d genuinely love to connect and see where a meaningful conversation could lead.

Then one day she complimented me but I didn’t think anything of it, I’m a regular at this point.

Then I started getting notes on my cups and she would always pop her head out to say hello to me even tho she never worked at the window anymore

Still never thought anything of, but then after a lot of coffees with Hearts on the cup and stuff like ""heyyy king"" with hearts and stuff.

So one day I just decided to ask the window girl to tell her to come, I asked for her number and got it. We texted for 3 days and then she ghosted me.

**What Is “Metabolic Fitness Pro Lv. 1 - Nutritional Biochemistry - Dr. Bryan Walsh”?**

Let’s kick things off with the “what.” *Metabolic Fitness Pro Lv. 1 - Nutritional Biochemistry - Dr. Bryan Walsh* is a deep-dive, science-backed, no-fluff course for anyone wanting to truly understand how the body works at a biochemical level. It’s not your average wellness fluff—it’s the real academic deal made digestible. Dr. Walsh, known for blending clinical depth with real-world practicality, guides you through 15 massive modules filled with everything from the basics of cellular biology to complex pathways like methylation, inflammation, and metabolic integration. You don’t just learn *what* happens—you learn *why* it matters.

**Who Is It For? (Spoiler: It’s Not Just for Nerds)**

This course is ideal for functional medicine practitioners, health coaches, nutritionists, and advanced biohackers who are tired of surface-level advice and want to connect the dots at the cellular level. But here’s the cool part: if you’re just a super-curious health enthusiast with a passion for learning, *Metabolic Fitness Pro Lv. 1 - Nutritional Biochemistry - Dr. Bryan Walsh* gives you the tools to decode the body’s processes like a pro. Just be ready—it’s intense, but in the best way.

**Where Does All the Learning Happen?**

Anywhere, my friend. This entire program is delivered online, so you can take it at your own pace, on your own terms, whether you're on a tablet in a cozy coffee shop or pulling a late-night study session on your laptop. No need for a lecture hall—*Metabolic Fitness Pro Lv. 1 - Nutritional Biochemistry - Dr. Bryan Walsh* meets you where you're at.

**When Should You Dive In?**

Honestly? Yesterday. But now works too. Since it's self-paced, you can start whenever you're ready and move at a rhythm that fits your life. Whether you want to binge it like a Netflix series or pace it week-by-week, the structure is there to support your learning style.

**Why This Course Stands Out (aka the Gold Underneath the Hood)**

Most nutrition or fitness courses barely scratch the surface—they tell you *what* to do, but never *why* it works. This course flips the script. Dr. Bryan Walsh doesn’t just teach—you’re going to *understand* how metabolism works, how energy is made, how nutrients are transformed, and what happens when things go wrong. From glycolysis and lipolysis to mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation, this course is like opening the hood of a Ferrari and learning how every part fits together. It empowers you to think critically about health, instead of just memorizing facts.

**How Does It All Work? (Brace Yourself for the Curriculum)**

You’re looking at 15 detailed modules packed with video lectures (think: over 60 units!). It all begins with Functional Cellular Biology, then ramps into macronutrients—carbs, proteins, and fats. As you progress, you’ll get into the juicy stuff: biochemical pathways like glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, beta-oxidation, gluconeogenesis, and more. The final modules tie it all together with practical clinical application, metabolic integration, and systems-level understanding of inflammation, the nervous system, and mitochondria.

**Final Thoughts: Is It Worth It?**

Absolutely. If you want to be *dangerously smart* when it comes to nutritional biochemistry, *Metabolic Fitness Pro Lv. 1 - Nutritional Biochemistry - Dr. Bryan Walsh* delivers. This isn’t some glossed-over course with fancy graphics and empty promises—it’s the kind of education that changes how you see the body and empowers you to make smarter decisions, whether in clinic or daily life.",1,1746413288.0,OberonLearning,1,1.0,False

1kf18r8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1kf18r8/the_friends_i_made_at_the_beginning_of_university/,The friends I made at the beginning of university made it hard for me to make new friends,"Long story, but I appreciate it if you read the whole way through. I am now 23 (F), but this happened several years ago and I'm still so bitter about it.

Before I started university I was in an abusive relationship that had left me graduating high school with no close friends and I was just coming to terms with my anxiety disorder. I started university during the pandemic, so that meant regularly I only spent time with my family and ex, but I really wanted to make friends so I joined several student groupchats and discords. I met my friend Alia at that time and we hit it off. We were texting all the time, facetiming, sharing book recommendations, and planning things to do together when she finally moved to the town where our university is located. One big thing we talked about is how hard isolation was and how when we were back in person we would form the best friend group ever and make friends with lots of new people. This year took a particular turn for the worse because I broke up with my ex after I found out they cheated and an important family member died.

A year later we finally meet in person at a party and I was so excited to meet her, but when I got there she was so drunk. I was disappointed because I was looking forward to chatting with her and supporting each other at our first big uni party, but she kind of abandoned me. I let it slide because I knew she had bad anxiety and was drinking to cope, so I kept an eye on her but decided to talk to new people. I then met Samantha and we hit it off too. She was cool, funny, and it felt like we had a lot in common. Soon the three of us were thick as thieves. We regularly had sleepovers, texted daily, travelled to each others hometowns, spent our birthdays together, and went to a concert together. Third year rolls around and everything is back to the way it was pre-covid. I confide in my friends telling them that I'm feeling anxious because I really want to make new friends, but I've always found talking to new people tricky (particularly due to my social anxiety). On the first day of school I meet up with Alia and she's hanging out with a new friend, and I immediately feel like the third wheel. At a later date when Alia and I are hanging out just the two of us I mention the fact that I'd love to become friends with her new friends too because they seem really cool and I'd love to be invited to things as a group. She gets defensive and essentially says ""Well it really isn't up to me but sure I'll keep that in mind"". Then Thanksgiving rolls around and this is when shit starts to happen. I new that Alia was having a friendsgiving with some of her other friends who were also from out of town, and I was happy for her while I celebrated the holiday with my family (my hometown is also where my university is). However, the next time the three of us have class together I find out through another person that Samantha also was at the friendsgiving. That would totally normal if it wasn't for the fact that Samantha is from the same town as me/our university and she was with her family earlier that day. I reach out to Alia later that day to express my frustration that it hurt my feelings how Samantha was invited and I wasn't which made me feel excluded, and Alia just kept making excuses. The argument ended in Alia telling me we should just be ""casual friends"". I was heartbroken. Alia was the friend I was closest with and she had been there for me when I had gone through all those hard things in first year, so she felt like the person I trusted most in my life. A few weeks later Samantha posted on social media about hanging out with Alia, and this is after I had isolated myself from people for a while (leaving as soon as class was done, not making the first move to text/hangout, and generally being quiet in class) and Samantha had not said anything about it. I asked Samantha if she was mad at me, to which she replied that we hadn't talked in a while and that her and Alia hanging out was ""perfectly normal"". I just isolated further because I truly felt so judged for wanting time and care from my friends. Alia never said anything else and Samantha never tried to reach out to find out what was going on with me or get my perspective.

Another year later I'm in a loving relationship with the most patient, understanding, caring person I have ever met and I begin to open up about how I was abused and how my previous friends really made it hard to trust. My partner got me feeling so good about myself again and I began reaching out more to new people, going to more events, and generally putting myself out there. The one part that I really struggled with was having all my classes with my ex-friends. It was so uncomfortable. So I reached out to Alia asking if we could meet sometime to talk to hopefully make things less uncomfortable. She agreed and we scheduled a time. 10 minutes before the meetup she said nevermind and that she hopes I have a good time with the rest of my studies. I felt so stupid and resentful, but I still felt like I had no closure with Samantha. So I texted Samantha asking how she was and how come she never reached out when I started getting distant. She replied with the longest, cruellest, least willing to take responsibility message I have ever read. She told me my mental health was too much, that we had nothing in common, that I was too needy, and then she ended it with ""do not try to reach out to me again"". I felt so blind-sided and angry because Samantha had mental health struggles too. In fact, she was at the beginning of understanding some new diagnoses and I was trying my best to be there for her, but she was incredibly private. I admit that isolating myself wasn't necessarily the most mature way to handle everything, but her response essentially shamed me for my openness about my social anxiety and made me feel like a burden she was glad to be rid of.

I tried so many times now to make new friends in my program, but it seems every time they just become best friends with Alia and Samantha. I became friends with Chloe and I told her that being around Alia and Samantha made me uncomfortable, but I was always happy hanging out with her when they weren't around. Chloe began getting closer and closer to Alia and Samantha and more and more distant from me, but I wanted to keep our friendship going. I invited Chloe to my birthday party and she told me ""I don't think it's a good idea if I come, but happy birthday!"" She never brought up why she didn't think it was a good idea with me and whenever we had class together she acted like everything was just fine. I then became friends with Marsha and from the get-go I told her I really wanted to make new friends in my program because I'd had such a bad falling out with my past friends. She was kind and told me she'd be wary and keep that in mind, but I did know she was friends with Chloe so she would interact with Alia and Samantha often enough. In my last semester of university Marsha began posting about hanging out frequently with Alia and Chloe, and I reached out to have a talk with her over coffee. She left me on read. We ran into each other about a month later and she was like ""I saw your message and I promise I'll reply soon!"" It's nearly a year later and it's still crickets. Another friend I made was through my student job and she was also in the same university program as me, but now she regularly posts about group hangouts with Alia, Marsha, and Chloe.

If you made it this far thank you for reading, I really appreciate it. I'm hoping by posting this into the void of the internet that maybe it'll give me some solace. I have many new friends now who are so caring and understanding, I just find sometimes I'm still so resentful and they left me with serious trust issues that have been an obstacle at times for getting closer to others.

Prunilda Plum never lacked self-confidence. An overachiever, there was much she couldn't do if she applied her mind. But that same mind compelled her to snack without restraint on everything sweet and savory. She had a notorious weakness for Trader Joe's dark chocolate peanut butter cups and could devour an entire tub by herself. Being fat in America is the norm and she was proud of her full figure. But beneath her confident exterior, her plush blanket of flesh told a different story.   
  
Her skin was a topographic map of turbulence, with stretch marks that resembled the aftermath of a lightning storm on steroids. They felt like tender, sensitive terrain, and the slightest touch sparked a storm of synaptic transmissions. Jagged, ivory-white streaks zigzagged across her skin, once stretched taut by her weight, now loose and flabby like bolts of lightning that had short-circuited and decided to take up permanent residence. The pearlescent lines streaked across her skin like the lingering imprint of lightning bolts, seared into her flesh as indelibly as the flash of a bolt still burns in your eyes long after you've looked away.   
  
These flesh expansion striations were a constant reminder of her struggles with weight, and she often found herself covering them up with clothing layered like lasagna. Her body had become a real-time lightning map. Each mark pulsed with the promise of another impending thundergust, as if her skin was daring the universe to unleash another tempest. The sheer drama of these lightning strikes made it seem as though her skin was aggregating cosmic weather reports from all ages, with stretch marks serving as the electrifying evidence.   
  
Determined to rewrite her body's weather forecast, Prunilda dialed Dr. Dryman's hotline to schedule a Brain Dehydra procedure, a revolutionary new technique that desiccated her brain to the consistency of a prune, eliminating entire snack aisles from her consciousness. She was willing to risk turning her brain into a mustard seed if it meant no more late-night runs to Trader Joe's for oatmeal cookies with white chocolate.   
  
Two weeks later, after a crowded subway ride reeking of stale onion sweat and unwashed ass – a savvy decision to avoid the $9 Congestion Relief Zone toll – Prunilda walked into Dr. Dryman's bustling clinic, situated in the busy heart of Midtown Manhattan, where the unconventional Brain Dehydra procedure awaited.   
  
Dr. Dryman carefully inserted a nasopharyngeal catheter into Prunilda's nasal cavity, guiding it through the nasal passages and into the sphenoid sinus. The procedure was surprisingly comfortable, and Prunilda found herself wondering if the good doctor moonlighted as a nose whisperer, reconstructing broken noses for the world's most unfortunate mixed martial artists. With the catheter in place, Dr. Dryman connected a high-flow nasal cannula to a heated air generator, which would blow warm air directly into Prunilda's brain, initiating the dehydration process.   
  
The hot air, precisely controlled by a thermistor-regulated heating element, would gradually dry out the brain tissue, reducing its volume and, thereby, eliminating the neural pathways responsible for Prunilda's snack cravings. It was a bit like using a blowtorch to dehydrate tropical fruits. As the procedure progressed, Dr. Dryman monitored Prunilda's vital signs and brain activity using an electroencephalogram (EEG) and adjusted the airflow and temperature as needed to ensure a safe and effective brain-drying treatment. The EEG looked like a seismograph during an earthquake, but Dr. Dryman assured her it was all perfectly within beta parameters.

A week later, Brain Dehydra procedure's side effects began to manifest, Prunilda's thoughts took an unexpected plunge – into the depths of an all-consuming obsession with water. As the dehydrated neural pathways in Prunilda's brain reached a critical state of desiccation, it was as if her cerebral cortex had initiated a desperate salvage operation, forcibly rerouting all extraneous thoughts through a singular, water-logged lens. Every thought was like a drop of water tracing an erratic path down a rain-slicked glass surface. Every fleeting notion, every stray idea, was hijacked and transformed into a water-themed variant, as if her brain's electrical impulses were frantically seeking solace in the fluidity of H2O.   
  
As the hydra fixation reached its zenith, Prunilda's living room transformed into a veritable aquatic shrine. Water-patterned wallpaper seemed to ripple on the walls as she lounged on her plush couch, surrounded by a mesmerizing array of indoor fountains, their gentle gurgles harmonizing with the soothing sounds of ocean waves emanating from her Bluetooth speaker. The aroma of saltwater and seaweed rising like incense, tendrils of smoke reaching for the sky, as if she had lit a thousand sticks to honor the hydration gods.   
  
The soft hum of aquarium filters and the gentle lapping of water from the miniature pool in the corner created a calming ambiance, further amplified by the fine mist dispersing from the water fountain cap perched atop her head Prunilda felt like an obese mermaid, her senses lulled into a state of tranquility by the watery symphony. Her specially designed 'Hydra Hydration Suit' circulated water through visible tubes, creating an otherworldly aura as she basked in the aquatic ambiance. The suit's transparent tubes pulsed with a soft blue glow, like a network of glowing jellyfish suspended beneath her skin.   
  
On the coffee table, a collection of hydra figurines seemed to nod in approval as she sang along to Tyla's 'Water' on repeat, her voice barely audible over the cacophony of water sounds. Prunilda's singing was woefully off-key, but the water fountains seemed to appreciate her enthusiasm. As Kevin Costner battled the villainous Deacon in the Waterworld movie playing on her TV, Prunilda's obsession reached a fever pitch, setting the stage for the tragic denouement that would soon follow. The movie's aquatic action scenes seemed to mirror Prunilda's own descent into hydra madness, and she felt an unsettling sense of kinship with the film's water-obsessed characters. In the grips of hydra fixation's insidious side effect, Prunilda's parched psyche was consumed by an unquenchable thirst. Her mouth was a Sahara dryland, and her tongue felt like a strip of camel jerky left to desiccate in the calcining sun.   
  
She stumbled back to her apartment, fixated on the office-style water cooler in the corner, its 5-gallon jug precariously perched on top. With a fervor bordering on delirium, Prunilda triggered the dispenser, unleashing a deluge of water that she gulped down with reckless abandon, draining the entire jug in a matter of minutes. The water gushed out like the Ocoee Rapids, its cool liquid rush a momentary balm to Prunilda's moistureless soul. The ensuing waterlogged catastrophe sent her electrolyte balance into a catastrophic nosedive, precipitating a fatal arrhythmia, her heart thrashing like a fish out of water, its final, futile beats a desperate bid for life.  
  
As the ER docs would later report, Prunilda's hyponatremic havoc culminated in a textbook case of water intoxication-induced cardiac arrest – a tragically absurd finale to her quest for snack liberation. In the end, Prunilda's pursuit of moderation had been replaced by a lethal excess. The desiccated remnants of her brain having paradoxically spawned a thirst for destruction, testament that sometimes the cure for a craving is fatally flawed.",1,1746412876.0,Unstyle,0,1.0,False

1kf13ka,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1kf13ka/chips_chapter_1/,Chips - Chapter 1,"The snow floated, lazy and soft, blanketing Whitley Gap in a hush that even the plow trucks seemed reluctant to break. After a day and night of freezing rain, followed by a thick snowfall, the Kentucky roads were treacherous and devoid of traffic. Most people had the good sense to stay home. Liam Birch never paid much attention to good sense.

He gripped the steering wheel with one gloved hand, the other cradling a coffee thermos wedged into his cup holder. His truck roared beneath him, tires crunching over the hard-packed ice that lined the back roads into town.

Animal Control had called earlier that morning—short-staffed, over-capacity, and desperate. A dog needed out. Today. Snowstorm or not. Liam didn’t ask questions. He just pulled on his boots and grabbed a leash.

 The roads leading to the county shelter wound through overgrown pasture and hollowed-out barns, the kind of scenery that made people nostalgic for a Kentucky only their grandparents remembered. He passed Earl’s co-op, the old mill that no one had touched since the flood of ’97, and finally the squat concrete building that housed the county’s unwanted.

He parked, the engine idling for a moment before he cut it. The silence that followed was nearly complete—except for the distant, muted barking that cut through the cold, a reminder that there was work to be done.

Liam pulled his hood down and stepped through the double doors into the front lobby. Inside lay the familiar smell of bleach and wet dog. Industrial fans whirred, creating a constant rumble that accompanied the busy clutter of barking and metallic clanging. A phone rang in a nearby room, Liam knew it would likely go unanswered.

“Birch!” called a voice from the back. “We were about to call out the search and rescue dogs to go find you. People are running off the roads left and right out there. I’m surprised we have anyone here at all. How was your drive in?” A familiar face peered through the service window, Isaac, one of the Animal Control officers, smiled through to Liam.

“Not bad, but I know how to drive in weather like this, and having the truck helps.”

The officer nodded. “Well, we appreciate you coming out to pick her up. I think you’ll like her. She’s just your type.”

Liam’s brow rose. “I’m not sure if I should be nervous or excited to hear that. What’s her deal?”

“She’s a 6-year-old Staffy. She was surrendered to us after she attacked the other household dog. Owner said it was unprovoked. We just got her in and haven’t tested her with anyone yet, but being a surrender, especially with a history of aggression, she’s at the top of the chopping block,” Isaac went on. “She’s not suited for shelter life. She’s terrified back there, looking for her owner. She’s not doing well.” A look of pity came over the officer’s face.

“Well, that does sound like my type.” Liam sighed, “Let’s go get her.”

Isaac led him down the corridor, jingling his keys as he walked. Chain-link kennels lined the hallway, each with its own melody — tail thumps, claws on concrete, dogs of every size vocalizing their displeasure for their confinement. At the end of the row was another chain link gate, but no face waiting behind. It wasn’t until the men were right in front of the gate that Liam saw her: a tan huddle of dog, curled behind the elevated cot, facing away from the gate. She didn’t look up when they approached, even when Liam knelt and tapped the gate, she lay still.

“This is Chips,” the officer said.

Liam smiled. “Chips,” he said softly through the chain link. The dog’s ear twitched, but she didn’t turn. 

“She’s been through it,” Isaac went on. “But she’s sweet. I know she’s missing her person. She needs out of here.”

“I’ll take her.”

 

As they walked back toward the front, Chips stepping hesitantly at his side, Liam’s phone buzzed in his coat pocket. He shifted the leash to his left hand and fished it out.

“Hey, Renée. Yeah, I got her. We’re heading out now. I’ll update you when I get her home,” and after a brief response from the other end, he ended the call and dropped the cell phone back into his coat pocket.

From behind him, a woman’s voice called out. “Renée from APOD?”

She was standing near the front desk, bundled in a navy hoodie with the All Paws on Deck logo stitched on the chest. He noticed her eyes first, blue and bright, like they were carved from stained glass — her blonde hair was styled in two French braid pigtails, streaked with a hint of pink.

“She’s my boss,” the woman said, stepping forward. “Well, sort of. I’m a volunteer with APOD. Faith.” She held out her hand to Liam.

Liam took her hand in his, her grip firmer than he was expecting, “Liam.”

She glanced down at Chips. “You’re the one with the nice barn setup out at the Run, right?”

“That’s me.”

“I’ve heard of you. Renée says you’ve got a good eye for the rough cases.”

He shrugged. “They’re not so rough once you get to know them. You just gotta hear their side of the story sometimes.”

Faith smiled up at him, her blue eyes clear and inviting, “I see why Renée spoke so highly of you.”

Liam looked at her—really looked. She seemed so at ease in a place filled with fear and sorrow. She knew this place front to back. He had a feeling Faith could name every animal in here, without a moment’s hesitation. She radiated with determination and confidence.

Long story short he has always told me that faithfulness to him is very important. And since we were sexual very early on in the relationship he asked me if I watched any porn or looked at any in general I answered that no I don't since I never really liked it nor was interested in it. After that he told me that he'd like it to stay like that since we were in it for the long run he wanted that both of us be exclusive to each other not just physically but also mentally and emotionally. Of course to me this sounded amazing and nothing really happened that was until this January. We were both going through a very stressful time at school despite that though I made an effort to visit him still often and bring him food and so that he could have time to relax. I even made him a exam survival kit filled with his fav coffees, snacks, and even some school materials I knew he needed. The same day I gave it to him we made out and just stopped ourselves from having sex because I knew he needed to get work done. Once I got home we hopped on a call but suddenly I had the urge to go through his google account (he logged it into my laptop himself early on in the relationship) I scrolled only once and saw him searching for ""hot girls"" that were nude on reddit. My heart immediately sank because all trust I had seemingly went away. And when I looked at the time stamp of the search it was at 4pm I left his house at around 3:50pm so while I was heading home he was doing that behind my back.

Fast forward we've talked about it and I've went to counselling and therapy for it because it really did kind of kill something inside me. He's been a good bf since he hasn't done anything wrong but I still can't help having resentment towards him.

How do I heal or move forward from this

**At the Mill Tonight**

The high school wasn’t much to look at,The walls were chipped in places, the floors worn smooth from years of students walking the same halls. We all knew each other  at least, that’s how it felt. You couldn’t walk down the hallway without seeing the same faces, the same half-smiles from kids who’d been in your class since kindergarten. Some days, I didn’t mind it. There was actually a lot of comfort in knowing everyone. Mr. Blue, who talked about the weather like it was the most interesting subject on earth, Mrs. Malone, who wore the same cardigan every day, never seemed to notice when kids weren’t paying attention, and somehow seemed to be pregnant every single year she taught English. I didn’t have to think much about my family either. Mom stayed home and made dinner, Dad worked at the library, and my brother, Kyle, went off to college, he was barely home enough to talk to even before that anyway. The same bus ride every morning, the same group of friends who gathered at the same diner after school.  Nothing ever changed, which was comfortable like a blanket knitted by someone's elderly grandma, and so mind numbingly boring that I casually thought about walking into the lake every Tuesday night and never walking out again. 

	

That Tuesday was no different. I slid into my usual seat on the bus, second row from the back, knees against the cracked vinyl, earphones in but no music playing. Casey dropped into the seat across from me, his father’s russet skin sharply contrasted by his mother’s strawberry blond hair. His sparsely freckled face adorned with his usual grin, sharp and a little too wide,the kind that always made you feel like you’d missed the joke. He was the kind of person you just fell in with, without remembering how it started. One day he was peeling labels off soda bottles at the diner; the next he was leaning against your locker, showing up at the lake with a stolen six-pack and some half-baked dubious plan for the night.

Bri sat up front, pressed against the window, tracing little spirals in the fog on the glass. Nate and Jordan piled in next, laughing about something that had happened in the gym, shoving each other as they squeezed down the aisle. We all had our places in a little drifting orbit,barely different day to day, like planets circling a sun.

The bus rattled along the familiar route, past the corner store, the old cemetery, the turnoff toward the hills. I barely noticed it anymore. Casey tapped his foot against the seat in front of him, humming something under his breath, something I didn’t recognize. It was one of those mornings when everything felt a little too bright, the air a little too crisp, like the world was waiting for something to happen or maybe that’s colored by hindsight, either way by the end of Saturday October 15th, 2016 Casey would be dead. 

	Like every other Tuesday the cafeteria smelled like overcooked fries and bleach. I sat on the edge of our usual table, picking at the crust of my sandwich, half-listening, half-floating somewhere just behind my own eyes.

Brooksie was in full rant mode, soccer jersey tied around her waist, an apple in one hand. “I’m telling you, if Coach benches me again for ‘attitude,’ I’m done. I swear I’ll walk.”Across the table, Casey smirked, balancing a fork on the tip of his finger. 

“Yeah, sure. You’d miss the applause too much.”Brooksie shot him a glare sharp enough to cut glass. 

“At least I’m not failing bio, genius.” Casey flashed his signature grin at that. 

“C-plus is basically a B if you squint.”

Wren was half-hidden behind their sketchbook, charcoal on their fingers, eyes flicking up now and then to check on me. I could feel it before they even said anything. “You okay?” Wren asked quietly, tilting their head just enough to catch my eye.

I pulled my mouth into something that was supposed to be a smile. “Yeah. Just a headache.” That low hum in my skull had been there all morning, under the noise of lockers slamming, teachers droning, feet scuffing linoleum.

Nico dropped into the seat beside me so hard his tray nearly slid off the table. “Guys, guys, you won’t believe this, did you know the old mill on Lockhart used to be a quarantine site? Like, actual plague quarantine. In *this* town.” His voice dipped lower, like he was unveiling a great conspiracy.

Brooksie groaned. “Nico. Please.”

“No, I’m serious! I found this archive page”

 Brooksie cut in,“We’re not going ghost hunting at the mill,” crunching into her apple like punctuation. 

But Casey’s eyes lit up.“Wait. Why not?”

Wren let out a soft, resigned sigh.“Think about it,” Casey leaned in, elbows on the table, voice all bright mischief. “Friday night. No parents. Flashlights. Creepy abandoned building. Come *on*. It’s basically a rite of passage.”

Brooksie tossed her hands up. “You’re so predictable.”

I rolled a piece of sandwich crust between my fingers, feeling that quiet thrum under everything, like something pacing just out of sight. “Liza?” Wren’s voice pulled me back. They were all looking at me now. Brooksie. Nico. and Casey, with that grin.

“…Sure,” I heard myself say somewhere in the distance. “Why not.”

Casey let out a victorious whoop, slapping the table. Outside, the wind picked up, rattling the row of cafeteria windows. 

	He  caught me by my locker right before the last bell, looking like he always did too comfortable in his own skin, like he had all the time in the world to make sure everyone knew it. His elbow rested against the row of lockers as if the whole hallway belonged to him. 

“Hey” he said, flipping a set of keys around his finger with a practiced, bored motion. “I’m picking you up after dinner, cool?”

I paused, sliding my books into my bag, eyes focused on the half-scribbled note I’d left for myself earlier. Could I even go? Mom would have a fit. But then again, I hadn’t been able to say no to Casey in months.

I nodded, biting my lip. “Cool.”

He leaned closer, his shoulder brushing against the cold metal of the lockers, his voice low. “Just so you know, I’m not taking ‘no’ for an answer. So, don’t chicken out on me.”

I raised an eyebrow, trying to keep my face neutral. “Not planning on it.”

But my stomach fluttered in that annoying, nervous way. Not from the idea of sneaking out  I’d done it before, always with a bit of adrenaline and excitement which was, to no one's surprise, rare around here. It was him. There was something about the way he looked at me, like he was waiting for something, expecting it, and I hated that it made me feel like I was standing on the edge of something without knowing if I was going to jump or not.

His grin widened, though it didn’t reach his eyes. They were distracted, flicking toward the doors where the bell was already ringing. “Good. Don’t make me chase you down.”

I didn’t respond, but there was a lump in my throat I couldn’t swallow down. Instead, I shoved my books into my bag a little harder than necessary, just to distract myself. I managed a weak smile, watching him disappear down the hall. My thoughts raced ahead of me, jumping from one thing to another. I pushed most of them aside though. The more I thought about it, the more it felt like I was digging myself into a hole I wasn’t sure how to get out of anyway. I grabbed my bag, hoisted it over my shoulder, and shoved my way through the crowded hallway as the final bell rang. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was already in too deep. And, for once, Casey wasn’t going to be the only one getting us all in trouble.

My mom was standing in the kitchen, wearing that apron she always wore when she cooked, the one that had strawberries all over it and was starting to look a little faded at the edges. She didn’t look up when I entered, her back turned as she worked on something at the stove. I took a deep breath before I spoke.

“Mom,” I said, my voice a little hesitant, but I pushed through it. “Can I have a sleepover at Brooksie’s tonight?”

She didn’t turn around immediately, and for a second, I thought she hadn’t heard me.

“Liza, it’s a school night,” she said, her voice already tightening with that tone she used when she wasn’t in the mood to argue. “You need to be home. We’ve already tried this before and you were two hours late for school.”

I bit my lip, trying not to let the frustration show on my face. “It’s just one night, Mom. We’re not doing anything crazy. We’re just hanging out.”

She finally turned to face me, wiping her hands on the towel. There was a flicker of disbelief in her eyes. “ You’re already on edge with your grades. This is *exactly* the kind of thing I’ve been warning you about, Liza.”

I could feel my frustration rising. “I’m not asking for much. I just want one night to relax. I’ve been doing everything you’ve asked me to do.”

“Don’t even start with that.” She shook her head, the edge in her voice growing sharper. “You can’t just keep just making excuses and expecting the world to pave the way for you on its own sweetheart you’ve gotta put in some actual work here.”

“I’m not making excuses,” I snapped, my voice louder than I intended. “It’s just a sleepover. It’s not like I’m going out to party or something.”

Her eyes narrowed, her lips tightening into a thin line. “It’s a *school night*, Liza. You have responsibilities. This is not a joke.”I opened my mouth to argue, but she held up a hand, cutting me off.

“No. You’re not going. End of discussion.”

I felt my chest tighten, the pressure building. I needed to get out. My thoughts spun, but I knew I couldn’t just stay here. There was no way I was staying home tonight—not when Casey was waiting for me.

“Mom, please,” I tried again, my voice softer, but she wasn’t having it.

“No. Absolutely not.” She folded her arms across her chest, that finality in her tone that meant there was no room for negotiation.

I stared at her, the words choking in my throat. She didn’t understand. She never did.

Without thinking, I turned on my heel and headed for the stairs. “I’m going to my room,” I muttered, trying to hide the irritation in my voice.

“You can stay in your room, but you’re *not* leaving this house,” she called after me.

I slammed my bedroom door behind me, the sound reverberating in the quiet house. My heart was pounding, but I had a plan. I wasn’t going to stay here, not tonight.

Later that night, at 12:07 A.M., I yanked my bag out from under the bed, not caring if it was messy. I needed to move fast.

I packed quickly. I grabbed my phone and texted Casey at 12:10 A.M.

*I’ll meet you in ten minutes.*

I could already feel the rush of adrenaline starting to take over.  My mom wouldn’t notice until it was too late. I crept over to the window and slowly cracked it open. The cool evening air hit me, and I could hear the distant hum of the neighborhood, the soft rustle of leaves in the wind.

I could do this.

I climbed out the window, holding my breath as I gently pulled myself onto the roof. I kept low, praying my parents wouldn’t hear me. The moonlight illuminated the path ahead of me, the familiar street stretching out like an open invitation to freedom. I dropped down to the grass below, the soft thud of my feet against the ground muffled by the cool night. My heart was racing as I made my way down the street, heading for Casey’s truck.

It wasn’t until I rounded the corner and saw the truck parked a few houses down that I allowed myself to breathe again. Casey was leaning against the side of the truck, looking like he was ready to roll his eyes at the whole situation. His hands were shoved into the pockets of his hoodie, the same one he wore every night.

“About time,” he said with a grin, pushing off the truck as I approached.

I didn’t say anything. I just slipped into the passenger seat, tossing my bag next to me. Casey closed the door behind me, and we pulled away, the engine of the truck rumbling to life.

For a second, the tension in my chest eased. I’d made it. I was out.

I stared ahead, the dark streets rolling by, but my mind was still racing. Casey didn’t say anything at first, but then he glanced over at me, his smile fading just a little.

“So, you really snuck out?” he asked quietly, like he was unsure if it was a joke or something serious.

I nodded, my voice barely above a whisper. “I had to. She wouldn’t let me go.”

Casey chuckled softly, but there was a strange tension in his voice. 

I turned to look at him, the moonlight catching the sharp angles of his face. “Well, sometimes you have to. You don’t always get to do what you want, do you?”

He was silent for a moment, eyes fixed on the road ahead. Then, he finally said, “Yeah. I guess you don’t.”

For a moment, there was a strange kind of weight between us, like something was about to be said but never quite reached the surface. Instead, the truck’s headlights sliced through the darkness, and we drove on, the quiet stretching between us.

The truck hummed as it sped down the darkened streets, the glow of the dashboard casting a soft light over the two of us. The silence wasn’t uncomfortable, but it wasn’t exactly easy either. Casey's hands gripped the wheel, his knuckles slightly white as he drove. I could hear the faint rhythm of his foot tapping on the pedal, like he was trying to drown out the quiet.

I could feel it, though. The tension. It was like there was something hanging in the air, something both of us were avoiding but both knew was there. I could feel it building with every second of silence between us.

Finally, Casey cleared his throat, but didn’t look at me. “So, uh... what happens if your mom finds out?”

I shrugged, trying to keep things casual. ""She won’t. It’s fine.""

He glanced at me then, just for a second, like he was trying to figure out if I was lying or if I really believed it. “You’re brave, sneaking out like that.”

I smirked, trying to hide how my chest tightened with his attention. “I’m not exactly scared of my mom,” I said, but my voice felt thin. Like it wasn’t quite me.

Casey grinned a little, but his eyes were still glued to the road. “Yeah, well, I wouldn’t want to be the one to explain it to her,” he muttered under his breath, but then there was a pause, one that dragged on longer than I expected.

“I don’t think she’d care that much if she knew,” I said quietly, and I could feel the words sink between us, heavy and awkward. There was something in the way he was looking at the road—something that told me he wasn’t just looking at the road.

He shifted in his seat, his shoulders tight. Then he laughed, but it wasn’t the usual carefree laugh. It was a little strained, like he was trying to make light of something that wasn’t light at all. “Yeah, well, it’s, uh… it’s not about her, is it?” he said, voice dropping a little, like he was testing the words as they left his mouth.

I turned to face him, suddenly feeling like my heart had skipped a beat. “What do you mean?”

He avoided my gaze again, running a hand through his hair, his fingers tugging at the strands like he was trying to pull the right words out. “I don’t know. It’s just—” He let out a shaky breath and, for a moment, I thought maybe he wasn’t going to say anything at all.

But then, almost too quietly, he said, “I just don’t want you to get in trouble for something dumb. You know?”

I stared at him, trying to piece together what he was actually trying to say. I knew Casey. He wasn’t usually like this. And I couldn’t quite tell if he was talking about me sneaking out or something else entirely. Something I hadn’t expected.

His grip on the wheel tightened again, and I could feel the space between us stretch out, too wide to ignore now. His voice dropped even lower, almost too soft for me to hear. “I just—I don’t want you to... I mean, not to get hurt or whatever, but also...”

I tilted my head, frowning. “Casey... what are you trying to say?”

He hesitated, and for a moment, I thought he might actually admit it. That he might say whatever it was that was crawling under the surface, the thing neither of us had ever said out loud. But then his shoulders slumped, and he gave me a half-smile, the kind he always gave when he was trying to play it off.

“It’s nothing. Forget it,” he said, his voice a little too casual.

And just like that, the moment slipped away, like water through my fingers. I couldn’t help but feel the sting of it, though. He had almost said it, whatever *it* was. But in the end, he didn’t.

We drove on in silence after that, the weight of the unspoken words hanging between us, but neither of us had the guts to bring it up again.

Maybe next time.

The truck slowed as we neared the mill, the familiar outline of the old building in the thick wooded area looming ahead in the darkness. We climbed out of the truck and walked toward the others, who were already gathered near the front of the mill. The group stood in a loose circle, their faces illuminated by the dim light of a few flashlights they’d brought along.

The gravel crunched under our shoes as Casey and I approached the group huddled near the mill’s rusted double doors. The place looked worse than I remembered,its roof sagging like a spine too long bent, windows like blank eyes staring out at nothing. The air smelled of wet wood, rust, and something fainter, something off,like dried blood soaked into old earth.

Nico was already halfway through a retelling of the mill’s cursed history, waving his flashlight like a sword. “and they say if you step through the northern doorway at midnight, the ghosts of the quarantined patients will follow you out.”

Brooksie rolled her eyes so hard I could practically hear it. “Nico, if I get tetanus from this dump, I’m blaming you and your sixth-grade ghost stories.”

“Not a story,” he insisted. “It’s *documented*. There were, like, plague doctors and everything—actual masks. One guy apparently walled himself in. They found bones.”

Casey smirked and tossed a rock at Nico’s feet. “Then maybe you can join him, if the floor gives out.”

Wren stood with her arms crossed, hoodie zipped up to her chin covering her platinum bleached hair which stood out like a sore thumb against everyones black clothing, she eyed the building like it might lunge at her. “So how exactly are we getting in? Those doors look like they’ve been rusted shut since the Cold War.”

“Back window,” Casey said smoothly, already moving toward the side of the building. “Near the northeast corner.”

“And just how are we going to open-” Casey interrupted her sentence by throwing a large stone through the window. 

I followed behind them, the beam of my flashlight catching on twisted ivy, broken shingles, and graffiti-scrawled concrete. The others trailed close, their chatter dying as we rounded the side of the building and the woods pressed in around us.

Casey stopped by a warped piece of plywood half-covering a jagged window just above shoulder height. “Here,” he said, gesturing like a magician revealing the trick. “One of you boosts me, and then I’ll pull everyone else up.”

“Why is it always you first?” Wren asked softly, but there wasn’t real resistance in their voice.

Casey shot them a wink. “Because I’m charming, and you’d miss me just the right amount if I disappeared.”

He handed me his flashlight and set a foot against the wall. I knelt instinctively, threading my fingers together for a boost. He stepped up and pushed himself through the window with practiced ease, vanishing into the darkness with a faint grunt and the sound of old wood creaking.

There was a pause.

Then a *click*.

The side door creaked open an inch.

“Hey look at that!” He boasted triumphantly. “Now I don’t have to touch any of you.” 

Everyone shuffled inside, grimacing at the failed comedian we’d brought along, flashlights sweeping the dark interior. The air was heavier here, the smell of dust, mildew, and something older like scorched metal. My stomach tightened.

Inside, the mill was skeletal. Rotting beams framed the long-dead heart of the building, broken furniture lay scattered like old bones, and somewhere above, something dripped steadily—*plip... plip... plip*—like a leaky faucet in a house long abandoned.

Nico took point, already narrating again. “Legend says this place was condemned after a fever outbreak in 1906. They say—”

“Nico,” Brooksie cut in. “Shut up and help us figure out where we’re going before you summon something by accident.”

Casey lifted his flashlight, its beam landing on a spiral staircase at the far end of the room, half-swallowed by shadow. “Up there,” he said. “There’s an old loft. Probably the safest place to sit and drink this sad excuse for beer.”

He patted the backpack slung over his shoulder, and Brooksie raised an eyebrow. “How’d you even *get* beer?”

Casey grinned. “Nico’s older brother.”

“Hey!” Nico objected.

We gathered near the base of the stairs, debating whether they’d hold our weight. Nico gave the first step an experimental bounce, then climbed three steps before turning back. “Stable enough,” he said. “Just don’t all come up at once.”

One by one, we followed him, Wren’s hand brushing mine briefly as we ascended. They offered a faint smile, the kind they saved for when they were worried and wanted someone to worry with them so they didn’t feel alone.

The loft creaked ominously but held. A shattered window let in a shaft of moonlight, pale and cold. The group sat in a rough circle on crates, torn tarps, or the floor. Casey passed out warm cans of beer, and Nico launched into yet another urban legend. This time a staple of the area,  about some man who goes crazy when he finds his wife cheating on him and murders her and their children, But of course inside an abandoned Steel Mill  the story didn’t exactly feel casual.

It felt like waiting.

Like holding your breath before something breaks.

I leaned back against the wall, can untouched, my fingers brushing the floor where something sticky clung to the wood  rust maybe. The scent of burnt sweetness curled faintly into the air.

I stiffened.

The others didn’t seem to notice. But something shifted behind my eyes, a memory tugging at the edges of the present.

That smell again. Burnt sugar.

Wet iron.

And somewhere outside, just beyond the walls, I swore I heard it quiet, distant

**Laughter.**

Just for a second.

Then it was gone.

**Thunderstorms**

Wren looked up sharply. “Did anyone else hear that?”

“What?” Nico asked, halfway through some gory twist in his ghost story.

“That scraping sound.” And there it was  slow, deliberate, something dragging itself across concrete somewhere below us.

“Rats?” Nico offered, but even he sounded unsure.

“Nope,” Brooksie said, standing. “Nope. No rats make *that* noise.”

We all went quiet.

The sound came again. Closer. Louder. Not skittering like claws scraping, like rusted nails across steel.

Then a thump. Heavy. Like something fell.

We all jumped.

Casey swung his flashlight toward the staircase, but it barely pierced the black. “You guys heard that, right?”

Brooksie muttered, “I knew this was a stupid idea.” She looked at me angrily. 

“I didn’t even say anything,” I shot back.

“Yeah, but you’ve been weird all day. You knew something was off. And you still said yes.”

I felt heat rise to my cheeks. “Oh, so now this is my fault?”

“Well, you and Casey came in here like it was a date night”

“Okay, *what?*” Casey said, cutting in.

Wren stepped between us. “Let’s not do this now.”

“No,” Brooksie said, pointing at me. “She dragged us into this. She’s been off for weeks moping around, acting like she’s haunted or something. And now *this* place feels like it’s watching us and we’re just supposed to pretend it’s fine?”

“That’s not fair,” Wren said quietly, but the damage was done.

Brooksie grabbed her bag. “I’m out. I don’t care if we have to hike through the woods. I’m not staying in here to get cursed or possessed or whatever this is.”

Nico stood too, clearly spooked. “Yeah. I’m with her. I came for some spooky vibes, not a seance.”

Wren lingered, looking between me and casey. “Do you want me to stay?”

I almost said yes. But Casey hadn’t moved. His face was tight, unreadable, his flashlight beam frozen on the stairs.

“I’m good,” I said. “Just... get them out safe?”

Wren nodded slowly, then disappeared down the stairs with the rest.

Suddenly, the silence was sharp.

Casey exhaled. “That got intense.”

I rubbed the back of my neck. “Brooksie’s always like that when she’s scared.”

“She’s not wrong though. That noise wasn’t nothing.”

We both went still.

Below us something moved. Not scraping this time. Footsteps. Measured. One step. Pause. Another.

Casey’s eyes locked on mine. “There’s someone down there.”

My blood went cold. “Then why are they not using a light?”

We both crouched low. Casey shut off his flashlight. The only light now came from the moon, stretched long across the floor like cold fingers.

The footsteps stopped. Right at the base of the stairs.

We waited.

And then

**tap**.	 **tap**.	 **Tap**.

Something began to climb.

Casey grabbed my hand.

I didn’t even realize I’d reached for him first.

“Liza,” he whispered, breath warm against my ear, “we need to move.”

We backed toward the far side of the loft. No floorboards creaked beneath our feet, like the building wanted silence.

The tapping got louder. 

Closer.

We ducked behind an old workbench and dropped low.

I turned to him, my voice barely there. “Whatever this is… I don’t think it wants the others.”

He looked at me. “You think it wants *us*?”

And then something **laughed**.

Right at the top of the stairs.

A voice like static and syrup.

But when Casey stood up and shone his flashlight toward the sound

There was nothing there.

Just dust. Just silence. We ran.

Not down the stairs, not at first. Just away. Across the loft, away from that spot at the top of the staircase where the laughter had curled into the air like smoke.

Casey pulled me with him, flashlight bouncing in jerky arcs across the broken floor, throwing long shadows that moved when we didn’t. The beam stuttered over splintered wood, old crates, rusted machinery but nothing human. Nothing solid. Just that sound behind us.

Dragging. Scraping. 

Low and wrong and echoing from places it shouldn’t reach.

We hit the opposite edge of the loft, and Casey turned in a tight circle, scanning for another way down.

“Ladder!” he hissed, pointing to a rusted fire escape ladder bolted crookedly against the far wall. Half the rungs looked ready to give under a sneeze, but it was that or go back toward the stairs.

We didn’t hesitate.

I went first, my palms slick on the cold metal, heart pounding so loud I thought it might give us away. 

“Don’t look back,” Casey murmured above me. “Just go.”

A sound split the air sharp, high-pitched, like metal tearing in half. Screeching.

My foot slipped on a rung slick with rain, but Casey caught me before I fell.

We hit the ground behind the mill and didn’t stop running.

The woods loomed dark and close, branches clawing at our arms, brambles catching on our jeans. We crashed through them, blind and breathless. Somewhere in the distance, thunder growled, and the sky cracked open.

Rain began to fall in cold sheets.

I didn’t look behind us. I couldn’t. Every instinct in me screamed not to turn around, not to give it shape by seeing it. But I felt it. In my bones. Breathing down our necks. Smiling**.**

We hit the clearing by the old drainage pipe and turned hard. Mud sucked at my shoes, my jacket plastered to my skin. The rain turned everything to black glass, every tree a silhouette twisted wrong. Casey’s hand was still gripping mine like a lifeline.

The truck was just ahead.

A bolt of lightning split the sky, illuminating the hill and for a split second, in the space between thunder and breath, I saw it.

Standing just beyond the treeline.

Tall. 

Too tall.

Head tilted. Limbs too long. Like a man whose skin didn’t quite fit.Then darkness swallowed it again.

Casey unlocked the truck with shaking hands and we dove inside, slamming the doors, locking them immediately. The moment the truck was sealed up, the rain turned violent sheets of it crashing onto the windshield, thunder rattling the frame.

We sat there, panting, soaked, staring out into the woods like it might crawl into the cab next.

“…Did you see” Casey started.

“Don’t,” I cut him off, voice cracking. 

He swallowed, nodded once.

The interior lights flickered. My breath fogged the window.

“Where are the others?” I asked suddenly.

Casey’s eyes went wide. He leaned forward, scanning the lot, the road, the trees. “They were supposed to head back,” he said, voice too tight, too quiet. But there was nothing. No shapes in the dark. No flashlights. No footsteps in the mud outside the truck but ours. The world outside was just rain and trees and shadows that didn’t move right. I felt a sharp jolt of panic seize my chest. “Casey,” I said, voice barely audible over the downpour, “Where the hell are they?”

The truck was still parked at the edge of the lot, headlights off, rain blurring everything outside into watercolors. The only light came from the dashboard’s faint glow and Casey’s phone screen, which he kept checking every few seconds like maybe someone would materialize just by him staring hard enough. I’d peeled off my jacket and draped it over my lap, water soaking into the seat beneath me. My fingers were numb. My teeth wouldn’t stop chattering. They were *gone*. The others. Brooksie, Wren, Nico. No lights, no shouting our names, no tracks in the mud. Just the woods. Just that thing.

Just us.

I pressed the heels of my palms into my eyes and tried to breathe. One. Two. Three. Don’t think about it. Don’t,

Casey’s phone buzzed.

He jumped like someone had slammed the hood, then turned the screen toward himself.

And froze.

“…What?” I asked, my voice hoarse.

“It’s, uh. It’s Wren.”

I leaned in as he read out loud:

**Wren:** hey. you two good? **Wren:** we made it home like 20 min ago. **Wren:** didn’t see you leave. was kinda worried.

I blinked at him. “Twenty… twenty *minutes* ago?”

Casey looked at the clock on the dash. 1:41 a.m.

We’d only left the mill *maybe* fifteen minutes ago. Maybe. “That doesn’t make sense,” he muttered, thumbs already tapping out a response.

**Casey:** wait what?? we just got to the truck. storm’s insane. thought you were still inside.

The reply came fast.

**Wren:** what? **Wren:** we left before it even started raining. Nico said you two were right behind us.

Casey and I looked at each other, the same sick understanding blooming between us.

They’d left *before* the rain started.

But it had been pouring—*slamming*—by the time we even hit the woods. The downpour had chased us the whole way.

Casey stared at the screen, then typed something else.

**Casey:** When did you leave exactly?

A few seconds passed. Another buzz.

**Wren:** idk exactly. like 1?? maybe a little before **Wren:** definitely before the rain started. **Wren:** why?

I swallowed hard.

**One.**

We were *still in the loft* at one. I’d seen it on my phone right before we heard the knocking.

And then we heard it again.

And again.

Casey dropped his phone into the center console like it had burned him. Rain hammered the roof above us, steady and unrelenting.

I didn’t speak.

I couldn’t.

Because something about this felt wrong.

Like the forest had changed the rules. Bent time. Bent *us*.

My phone buzzed in my pocket.

**Brooksie:** u alive or what **Brooksie:** Nico says he saw something in the rearview **Brooksie:** said it was tall af. hope it wasn’t you lol

I stared at it.

Read it again.

“…Casey?” I said, barely more than a whisper.

“Yeah?”

“I think we should leave. *Now.*”

He didn’t argue. Just turned the key, the engine rumbling back to life. The headlights cut through the rain, casting long, spidery shadows through the trees.

And as we pulled onto the road, I checked the rearview mirror.

Nothing followed us.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that it had *let* us go.

For now.

The truck’s heater kicked in about five minutes after we hit the road, and I started to feel my toes again. My jeans squished every time I shifted, and the seatbelt strap was sticking to my damp neck.

Casey kept looking at the road like it had personally betrayed him.

We’d barely spoken since pulling away from the mill, except for a few grunts and one dramatic “Jesus Christ” when a raccoon darted across the road and nearly gave us both matching heart attacks.

Eventually, I couldn’t take the silence anymore.

“So,” I said, teeth still chattering a little. “On a scale of one to existential crisis, how dead do you think we should be right now?”

He let out a short, unsteady laugh. “Negative three. Like we entered a different plane of reality and shouldn’t *exist* anymore.”

“Cool,” I nodded. “Same page.”

Another beat of silence. Then:

“Do you think this counts as a first date?” he asked, completely straight-faced.

I blinked at him. “What?”

“I mean” He gestured vaguely at the soaked truck, the empty road, his own shirt still clinging to him like a sad dishrag. “Creepy building, shared trauma, adrenaline. You literally grabbed my hand while we were being chased by... I dunno. Tim Burton’s wet dream ,He paused, I’m just saying, you climbed out your window and risked death for me. That’s at least coffee-worthy.”

“You said we were going ghost hunting,” I deadpanned. “We found actual ghosts. You *owe* me coffee.”

He let out a loud, relieved laugh. It echoed in the cab like it didn’t know whether to be joy or hysteria.

I laughed too—big and sudden—until I was doubled over, wiping tears from my face.

“This is the dumbest night of my life,” I gasped.

“Worse than homecoming sophomore year?”

“I broke my heel and got gum in my hair this *wins* by a landslide.”

Casey reached over, still smiling, and nudged my arm gently. “Hey. Seriously, though... thanks for not freaking out on me.”

I raised an eyebrow. “I *did* freak out.”

“Yeah, but like. In a manageable, *deeply* charming way.”

I turned toward him, still smiling. He looked back at me for half a second too long before snapping his eyes back to the road, suddenly sheepish.

“You are, uh...” He cleared his throat. “A lot braver than you think.”

My smile faded to something softer. My heart did a weird somersault I blamed entirely on adrenaline.

“Same to you,” I said. “Even if your ‘bravery’ looks suspiciously like poor decision-making.”

“I contain multitudes.”

We were quiet for a few more seconds. The rain was starting to let up. Steam fogged the windows, and the world outside looked sleepy and unfamiliar.

“You know,” I said eventually, “we’re either trauma bonded or this is the beginning of a really weird love story.”

Casey grinned. “Why not both?” I rolled my eyes, but it didn’t stop the warmth from creeping into my chest. 

“Hey,” I stuttered out. “Can we just park the truck somewhere, I don’t think I can be alone yet.” I stutter the words out nervously. He eyes me cautiously before turning the opposite direction of my house. “Casey please tell me you didn’t take that to mean I wanted to go to the old cemetery right now?” I mutter in disbelief.

“Actually we are going to the cemetery and I am a genius because even the cops don't want to go over that direction this late at night.” He says confidently as he slows down to drive on the twisty dirt road leading toward the gray pillar gravestones. I put my hands on my face, beginning to regret having said anything at all as he parks the truck and looks over at me expectantly. 

“You know,” he leans his head in my general direction, “for someone who isn't usually much of a risk taker you've sure had one hell of a night.” A soft breathy laugh escapes before I can make any effort to hold it in. He sees this as some kind of opportunity to reach forward and move a lock of my hair behind my ear. My eyes open wide, like a deer caught in a semi-trucks headlights. 

“Casey, I really hope you’re not trying to do what I think you’re trying to do because this is a piss-poor time to do it.” He smirked an unforgettable smirk, an “I’ll remember this for 20 years” smirk. Of course he did. 

“Then when should I do it Liz?” The question is rhetorical. He leans in and kisses me regardless. 

His lips were warmer than I expected, soft, hesitant at first, like he was giving me a chance to pull away. I didn’t. Maybe I should’ve. Maybe five hours ago I would’ve. But now?

Now I was in a fogged-up truck, parked in a haunted cemetery, soaked to the bone, having barely outrun something I couldn’t explain and Casey  was kissing me like it was the one thing in the world that still made sense.

My hands moved without thinking, one curling into the fabric of his hoodie, the other finding the side of his neck, damp skin and too-fast pulse under my palm. He leaned in harder at that, shifting closer until the gearshift jabbed him in the hip and made both of us laugh against each other’s mouths.

“You’re really bad at logistics,” I murmured, breathless, forehead pressed to his.

“I never claimed to be good at logistics,” he muttered, already leaning back in.

This time it wasn’t hesitant. His mouth was insistent, hungry not desperate exactly, but like we’d both been teetering on a ledge for too long and finally decided to jump. His hand came up to cup my cheek, thumb brushing just beneath my eye, grounding and gentle in a way that made my stomach flip.

I pulled him closer, not even thinking, knees bending under me so I could shift half into his lap. The truck’s cab was suddenly too small, the air too warm, my heart way too loud.

His hands found my waist, tentative like he was still asking permission even now. That made something in my chest go soft, sore in the best possible way.

We broke apart for air, just barely, our faces still close enough that I could feel his breath against my lips.

He grinned, all teeth, all trouble. “ I stand by that being a first date.”

“You’re insufferable,” I whispered.

“And yet,” he murmured, pressing another kiss to the corner of my mouth, “here you are.”

I could’ve kissed him again. I wanted to. But then something in the shadows shifted, probably just wind, or maybe the groan of an old oak tree and both of us flinched like idiots.

We stared at the foggy window for a beat, hearts still racing.

Then Casey whispered, “Okay, that’s enough horny-in-a-haunted-graveyard for one night.”

I snorted, flopping back into my seat. “Please tell me you’re putting that on my tombstone when this all eventually kills us.”

Some nights, I still hear him laughing out there, in the dark, somewhere I can’t follow.*



**At the Mill Tonight**

The high school wasn’t much to look at,The walls were chipped in places, the floors worn smooth from years of students walking the same halls. We all knew each other  at least, that’s how it felt. You couldn’t walk down the hallway without seeing the same faces, the same half-smiles from kids who’d been in your class since kindergarten. Some days, I didn’t mind it. There was actually a lot of comfort in knowing everyone. Mr. Blue, who talked about the weather like it was the most interesting subject on earth, Mrs. Malone, who wore the same cardigan every day, never seemed to notice when kids weren’t paying attention, and somehow seemed to be pregnant every single year she taught English. I didn’t have to think much about my family either. Mom stayed home and made dinner, Dad worked at the library, and my brother, Kyle, went off to college, he was barely home enough to talk to even before that anyway. The same bus ride every morning, the same group of friends who gathered at the same diner after school.  Nothing ever changed, which was comfortable like a blanket knitted by someone's elderly grandma, and so mind numbingly boring that I casually thought about walking into the lake every Tuesday night and never walking out again. 

	

That Tuesday was no different. I slid into my usual seat on the bus, second row from the back, knees against the cracked vinyl, earphones in but no music playing. Casey dropped into the seat across from me, his father’s russet skin sharply contrasted by his mother’s strawberry blond hair. His sparsely freckled face adorned with his usual grin, sharp and a little too wide,the kind that always made you feel like you’d missed the joke. He was the kind of person you just fell in with, without remembering how it started. One day he was peeling labels off soda bottles at the diner; the next he was leaning against your locker, showing up at the lake with a stolen six-pack and some half-baked dubious plan for the night.

Bri sat up front, pressed against the window, tracing little spirals in the fog on the glass. Nate and Jordan piled in next, laughing about something that had happened in the gym, shoving each other as they squeezed down the aisle. We all had our places in a little drifting orbit,barely different day to day, like planets circling a sun.

The bus rattled along the familiar route, past the corner store, the old cemetery, the turnoff toward the hills. I barely noticed it anymore. Casey tapped his foot against the seat in front of him, humming something under his breath, something I didn’t recognize. It was one of those mornings when everything felt a little too bright, the air a little too crisp, like the world was waiting for something to happen or maybe that’s colored by hindsight, either way by the end of Saturday October 15th, 2016 Casey would be dead. 

	Like every other Tuesday the cafeteria smelled like overcooked fries and bleach. I sat on the edge of our usual table, picking at the crust of my sandwich, half-listening, half-floating somewhere just behind my own eyes.

Brooksie was in full rant mode, soccer jersey tied around her waist, an apple in one hand. “I’m telling you, if Coach benches me again for ‘attitude,’ I’m done. I swear I’ll walk.”Across the table, Casey smirked, balancing a fork on the tip of his finger. 

“Yeah, sure. You’d miss the applause too much.”Brooksie shot him a glare sharp enough to cut glass. 

“At least I’m not failing bio, genius.” Casey flashed his signature grin at that. 

“C-plus is basically a B if you squint.”

Wren was half-hidden behind their sketchbook, charcoal on their fingers, eyes flicking up now and then to check on me. I could feel it before they even said anything. “You okay?” Wren asked quietly, tilting their head just enough to catch my eye.

I pulled my mouth into something that was supposed to be a smile. “Yeah. Just a headache.” That low hum in my skull had been there all morning, under the noise of lockers slamming, teachers droning, feet scuffing linoleum.

Nico dropped into the seat beside me so hard his tray nearly slid off the table. “Guys, guys, you won’t believe this, did you know the old mill on Lockhart used to be a quarantine site? Like, actual plague quarantine. In *this* town.” His voice dipped lower, like he was unveiling a great conspiracy.

Brooksie groaned. “Nico. Please.”

“No, I’m serious! I found this archive page”

 Brooksie cut in,“We’re not going ghost hunting at the mill,” crunching into her apple like punctuation. 

But Casey’s eyes lit up.“Wait. Why not?”

Wren let out a soft, resigned sigh.“Think about it,” Casey leaned in, elbows on the table, voice all bright mischief. “Friday night. No parents. Flashlights. Creepy abandoned building. Come *on*. It’s basically a rite of passage.”

Brooksie tossed her hands up. “You’re so predictable.”

I rolled a piece of sandwich crust between my fingers, feeling that quiet thrum under everything, like something pacing just out of sight. “Liza?” Wren’s voice pulled me back. They were all looking at me now. Brooksie. Nico. and Casey, with that grin.

“…Sure,” I heard myself say somewhere in the distance. “Why not.”

Casey let out a victorious whoop, slapping the table. Outside, the wind picked up, rattling the row of cafeteria windows. 

	He  caught me by my locker right before the last bell, looking like he always did too comfortable in his own skin, like he had all the time in the world to make sure everyone knew it. His elbow rested against the row of lockers as if the whole hallway belonged to him. 

“Hey” he said, flipping a set of keys around his finger with a practiced, bored motion. “I’m picking you up after dinner, cool?”

I paused, sliding my books into my bag, eyes focused on the half-scribbled note I’d left for myself earlier. Could I even go? Mom would have a fit. But then again, I hadn’t been able to say no to Casey in months.

I nodded, biting my lip. “Cool.”

He leaned closer, his shoulder brushing against the cold metal of the lockers, his voice low. “Just so you know, I’m not taking ‘no’ for an answer. So, don’t chicken out on me.”

I raised an eyebrow, trying to keep my face neutral. “Not planning on it.”

But my stomach fluttered in that annoying, nervous way. Not from the idea of sneaking out  I’d done it before, always with a bit of adrenaline and excitement which was, to no one's surprise, rare around here. It was him. There was something about the way he looked at me, like he was waiting for something, expecting it, and I hated that it made me feel like I was standing on the edge of something without knowing if I was going to jump or not.

His grin widened, though it didn’t reach his eyes. They were distracted, flicking toward the doors where the bell was already ringing. “Good. Don’t make me chase you down.”

I didn’t respond, but there was a lump in my throat I couldn’t swallow down. Instead, I shoved my books into my bag a little harder than necessary, just to distract myself. I managed a weak smile, watching him disappear down the hall. My thoughts raced ahead of me, jumping from one thing to another. I pushed most of them aside though. The more I thought about it, the more it felt like I was digging myself into a hole I wasn’t sure how to get out of anyway. I grabbed my bag, hoisted it over my shoulder, and shoved my way through the crowded hallway as the final bell rang. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was already in too deep. And, for once, Casey wasn’t going to be the only one getting us all in trouble.

My mom was standing in the kitchen, wearing that apron she always wore when she cooked, the one that had strawberries all over it and was starting to look a little faded at the edges. She didn’t look up when I entered, her back turned as she worked on something at the stove. I took a deep breath before I spoke.

“Mom,” I said, my voice a little hesitant, but I pushed through it. “Can I have a sleepover at Brooksie’s tonight?”

She didn’t turn around immediately, and for a second, I thought she hadn’t heard me.

“Liza, it’s a school night,” she said, her voice already tightening with that tone she used when she wasn’t in the mood to argue. “You need to be home. We’ve already tried this before and you were two hours late for school.”

I bit my lip, trying not to let the frustration show on my face. “It’s just one night, Mom. We’re not doing anything crazy. We’re just hanging out.”

She finally turned to face me, wiping her hands on the towel. There was a flicker of disbelief in her eyes. “ You’re already on edge with your grades. This is *exactly* the kind of thing I’ve been warning you about, Liza.”

I could feel my frustration rising. “I’m not asking for much. I just want one night to relax. I’ve been doing everything you’ve asked me to do.”

“Don’t even start with that.” She shook her head, the edge in her voice growing sharper. “You can’t just keep just making excuses and expecting the world to pave the way for you on its own sweetheart you’ve gotta put in some actual work here.”

“I’m not making excuses,” I snapped, my voice louder than I intended. “It’s just a sleepover. It’s not like I’m going out to party or something.”

Her eyes narrowed, her lips tightening into a thin line. “It’s a *school night*, Liza. You have responsibilities. This is not a joke.”I opened my mouth to argue, but she held up a hand, cutting me off.

“No. You’re not going. End of discussion.”

I felt my chest tighten, the pressure building. I needed to get out. My thoughts spun, but I knew I couldn’t just stay here. There was no way I was staying home tonight—not when Casey was waiting for me.

“Mom, please,” I tried again, my voice softer, but she wasn’t having it.

“No. Absolutely not.” She folded her arms across her chest, that finality in her tone that meant there was no room for negotiation.

I stared at her, the words choking in my throat. She didn’t understand. She never did.

Without thinking, I turned on my heel and headed for the stairs. “I’m going to my room,” I muttered, trying to hide the irritation in my voice.

“You can stay in your room, but you’re *not* leaving this house,” she called after me.

I slammed my bedroom door behind me, the sound reverberating in the quiet house. My heart was pounding, but I had a plan. I wasn’t going to stay here, not tonight.

Later that night, at 12:07 A.M., I yanked my bag out from under the bed, not caring if it was messy. I needed to move fast.

I packed quickly. I grabbed my phone and texted Casey at 12:10 A.M.

*I’ll meet you in ten minutes.*

I could already feel the rush of adrenaline starting to take over.  My mom wouldn’t notice until it was too late. I crept over to the window and slowly cracked it open. The cool evening air hit me, and I could hear the distant hum of the neighborhood, the soft rustle of leaves in the wind.

I could do this.

I climbed out the window, holding my breath as I gently pulled myself onto the roof. I kept low, praying my parents wouldn’t hear me. The moonlight illuminated the path ahead of me, the familiar street stretching out like an open invitation to freedom. I dropped down to the grass below, the soft thud of my feet against the ground muffled by the cool night. My heart was racing as I made my way down the street, heading for Casey’s truck.

It wasn’t until I rounded the corner and saw the truck parked a few houses down that I allowed myself to breathe again. Casey was leaning against the side of the truck, looking like he was ready to roll his eyes at the whole situation. His hands were shoved into the pockets of his hoodie, the same one he wore every night.

“About time,” he said with a grin, pushing off the truck as I approached.

I didn’t say anything. I just slipped into the passenger seat, tossing my bag next to me. Casey closed the door behind me, and we pulled away, the engine of the truck rumbling to life.

For a second, the tension in my chest eased. I’d made it. I was out.

I stared ahead, the dark streets rolling by, but my mind was still racing. Casey didn’t say anything at first, but then he glanced over at me, his smile fading just a little.

“So, you really snuck out?” he asked quietly, like he was unsure if it was a joke or something serious.

I nodded, my voice barely above a whisper. “I had to. She wouldn’t let me go.”

Casey chuckled softly, but there was a strange tension in his voice. 

I turned to look at him, the moonlight catching the sharp angles of his face. “Well, sometimes you have to. You don’t always get to do what you want, do you?”

He was silent for a moment, eyes fixed on the road ahead. Then, he finally said, “Yeah. I guess you don’t.”

For a moment, there was a strange kind of weight between us, like something was about to be said but never quite reached the surface. Instead, the truck’s headlights sliced through the darkness, and we drove on, the quiet stretching between us.

The truck hummed as it sped down the darkened streets, the glow of the dashboard casting a soft light over the two of us. The silence wasn’t uncomfortable, but it wasn’t exactly easy either. Casey's hands gripped the wheel, his knuckles slightly white as he drove. I could hear the faint rhythm of his foot tapping on the pedal, like he was trying to drown out the quiet.

I could feel it, though. The tension. It was like there was something hanging in the air, something both of us were avoiding but both knew was there. I could feel it building with every second of silence between us.

Finally, Casey cleared his throat, but didn’t look at me. “So, uh... what happens if your mom finds out?”

I shrugged, trying to keep things casual. ""She won’t. It’s fine.""

He glanced at me then, just for a second, like he was trying to figure out if I was lying or if I really believed it. “You’re brave, sneaking out like that.”

I smirked, trying to hide how my chest tightened with his attention. “I’m not exactly scared of my mom,” I said, but my voice felt thin. Like it wasn’t quite me.

Casey grinned a little, but his eyes were still glued to the road. “Yeah, well, I wouldn’t want to be the one to explain it to her,” he muttered under his breath, but then there was a pause, one that dragged on longer than I expected.

“I don’t think she’d care that much if she knew,” I said quietly, and I could feel the words sink between us, heavy and awkward. There was something in the way he was looking at the road—something that told me he wasn’t just looking at the road.

He shifted in his seat, his shoulders tight. Then he laughed, but it wasn’t the usual carefree laugh. It was a little strained, like he was trying to make light of something that wasn’t light at all. “Yeah, well, it’s, uh… it’s not about her, is it?” he said, voice dropping a little, like he was testing the words as they left his mouth.

I turned to face him, suddenly feeling like my heart had skipped a beat. “What do you mean?”

He avoided my gaze again, running a hand through his hair, his fingers tugging at the strands like he was trying to pull the right words out. “I don’t know. It’s just—” He let out a shaky breath and, for a moment, I thought maybe he wasn’t going to say anything at all.

But then, almost too quietly, he said, “I just don’t want you to get in trouble for something dumb. You know?”

I stared at him, trying to piece together what he was actually trying to say. I knew Casey. He wasn’t usually like this. And I couldn’t quite tell if he was talking about me sneaking out or something else entirely. Something I hadn’t expected.

His grip on the wheel tightened again, and I could feel the space between us stretch out, too wide to ignore now. His voice dropped even lower, almost too soft for me to hear. “I just—I don’t want you to... I mean, not to get hurt or whatever, but also...”

I tilted my head, frowning. “Casey... what are you trying to say?”

He hesitated, and for a moment, I thought he might actually admit it. That he might say whatever it was that was crawling under the surface, the thing neither of us had ever said out loud. But then his shoulders slumped, and he gave me a half-smile, the kind he always gave when he was trying to play it off.

“It’s nothing. Forget it,” he said, his voice a little too casual.

And just like that, the moment slipped away, like water through my fingers. I couldn’t help but feel the sting of it, though. He had almost said it, whatever *it* was. But in the end, he didn’t.

We drove on in silence after that, the weight of the unspoken words hanging between us, but neither of us had the guts to bring it up again.

Maybe next time.

The truck slowed as we neared the mill, the familiar outline of the old building in the thick wooded area looming ahead in the darkness. We climbed out of the truck and walked toward the others, who were already gathered near the front of the mill. The group stood in a loose circle, their faces illuminated by the dim light of a few flashlights they’d brought along.

The gravel crunched under our shoes as Casey and I approached the group huddled near the mill’s rusted double doors. The place looked worse than I remembered,its roof sagging like a spine too long bent, windows like blank eyes staring out at nothing. The air smelled of wet wood, rust, and something fainter, something off,like dried blood soaked into old earth.

Nico was already halfway through a retelling of the mill’s cursed history, waving his flashlight like a sword. “and they say if you step through the northern doorway at midnight, the ghosts of the quarantined patients will follow you out.”

Brooksie rolled her eyes so hard I could practically hear it. “Nico, if I get tetanus from this dump, I’m blaming you and your sixth-grade ghost stories.”

“Not a story,” he insisted. “It’s *documented*. There were, like, plague doctors and everything—actual masks. One guy apparently walled himself in. They found bones.”

Casey smirked and tossed a rock at Nico’s feet. “Then maybe you can join him, if the floor gives out.”

Wren stood with her arms crossed, hoodie zipped up to her chin covering her platinum bleached hair which stood out like a sore thumb against everyones black clothing, she eyed the building like it might lunge at her. “So how exactly are we getting in? Those doors look like they’ve been rusted shut since the Cold War.”

“Back window,” Casey said smoothly, already moving toward the side of the building. “Near the northeast corner.”

“And just how are we going to open-” Casey interrupted her sentence by throwing a large stone through the window. 

I followed behind them, the beam of my flashlight catching on twisted ivy, broken shingles, and graffiti-scrawled concrete. The others trailed close, their chatter dying as we rounded the side of the building and the woods pressed in around us.

Casey stopped by a warped piece of plywood half-covering a jagged window just above shoulder height. “Here,” he said, gesturing like a magician revealing the trick. “One of you boosts me, and then I’ll pull everyone else up.”

“Why is it always you first?” Wren asked softly, but there wasn’t real resistance in their voice.

Casey shot them a wink. “Because I’m charming, and you’d miss me just the right amount if I disappeared.”

He handed me his flashlight and set a foot against the wall. I knelt instinctively, threading my fingers together for a boost. He stepped up and pushed himself through the window with practiced ease, vanishing into the darkness with a faint grunt and the sound of old wood creaking.

There was a pause.

Then a *click*.

The side door creaked open an inch.

“Hey look at that!” He boasted triumphantly. “Now I don’t have to touch any of you.” 

Everyone shuffled inside, grimacing at the failed comedian we’d brought along, flashlights sweeping the dark interior. The air was heavier here, the smell of dust, mildew, and something older like scorched metal. My stomach tightened.

Inside, the mill was skeletal. Rotting beams framed the long-dead heart of the building, broken furniture lay scattered like old bones, and somewhere above, something dripped steadily—*plip... plip... plip*—like a leaky faucet in a house long abandoned.

Nico took point, already narrating again. “Legend says this place was condemned after a fever outbreak in 1906. They say—”

“Nico,” Brooksie cut in. “Shut up and help us figure out where we’re going before you summon something by accident.”

Casey lifted his flashlight, its beam landing on a spiral staircase at the far end of the room, half-swallowed by shadow. “Up there,” he said. “There’s an old loft. Probably the safest place to sit and drink this sad excuse for beer.”

He patted the backpack slung over his shoulder, and Brooksie raised an eyebrow. “How’d you even *get* beer?”

Casey grinned. “Nico’s older brother.”

“Hey!” Nico objected.

We gathered near the base of the stairs, debating whether they’d hold our weight. Nico gave the first step an experimental bounce, then climbed three steps before turning back. “Stable enough,” he said. “Just don’t all come up at once.”

One by one, we followed him, Wren’s hand brushing mine briefly as we ascended. They offered a faint smile, the kind they saved for when they were worried and wanted someone to worry with them so they didn’t feel alone.

The loft creaked ominously but held. A shattered window let in a shaft of moonlight, pale and cold. The group sat in a rough circle on crates, torn tarps, or the floor. Casey passed out warm cans of beer, and Nico launched into yet another urban legend. This time a staple of the area,  about some man who goes crazy when he finds his wife cheating on him and murders her and their children, But of course inside an abandoned Steel Mill  the story didn’t exactly feel casual.

It felt like waiting.

Like holding your breath before something breaks.

I leaned back against the wall, can untouched, my fingers brushing the floor where something sticky clung to the wood  rust maybe. The scent of burnt sweetness curled faintly into the air.

I stiffened.

The others didn’t seem to notice. But something shifted behind my eyes, a memory tugging at the edges of the present.

That smell again. Burnt sugar.

Wet iron.

And somewhere outside, just beyond the walls, I swore I heard it quiet, distant

**Laughter.**

Just for a second.

Then it was gone.

**Thunderstorms**

Wren looked up sharply. “Did anyone else hear that?”

“What?” Nico asked, halfway through some gory twist in his ghost story.

“That scraping sound.” And there it was  slow, deliberate, something dragging itself across concrete somewhere below us.

“Rats?” Nico offered, but even he sounded unsure.

“Nope,” Brooksie said, standing. “Nope. No rats make *that* noise.”

We all went quiet.

The sound came again. Closer. Louder. Not skittering like claws scraping, like rusted nails across steel.

Then a thump. Heavy. Like something fell.

We all jumped.

Casey swung his flashlight toward the staircase, but it barely pierced the black. “You guys heard that, right?”

Brooksie muttered, “I knew this was a stupid idea.” She looked at me angrily. 

“I didn’t even say anything,” I shot back.

“Yeah, but you’ve been weird all day. You knew something was off. And you still said yes.”

I felt heat rise to my cheeks. “Oh, so now this is my fault?”

“Well, you and Casey came in here like it was a date night”

“Okay, *what?*” Casey said, cutting in.

Wren stepped between us. “Let’s not do this now.”

“No,” Brooksie said, pointing at me. “She dragged us into this. She’s been off for weeks moping around, acting like she’s haunted or something. And now *this* place feels like it’s watching us and we’re just supposed to pretend it’s fine?”

“That’s not fair,” Wren said quietly, but the damage was done.

Brooksie grabbed her bag. “I’m out. I don’t care if we have to hike through the woods. I’m not staying in here to get cursed or possessed or whatever this is.”

Nico stood too, clearly spooked. “Yeah. I’m with her. I came for some spooky vibes, not a seance.”

Wren lingered, looking between me and casey. “Do you want me to stay?”

I almost said yes. But Casey hadn’t moved. His face was tight, unreadable, his flashlight beam frozen on the stairs.

“I’m good,” I said. “Just... get them out safe?”

Wren nodded slowly, then disappeared down the stairs with the rest.

Suddenly, the silence was sharp.

Casey exhaled. “That got intense.”

I rubbed the back of my neck. “Brooksie’s always like that when she’s scared.”

“She’s not wrong though. That noise wasn’t nothing.”

We both went still.

Below us something moved. Not scraping this time. Footsteps. Measured. One step. Pause. Another.

Casey’s eyes locked on mine. “There’s someone down there.”

My blood went cold. “Then why are they not using a light?”

We both crouched low. Casey shut off his flashlight. The only light now came from the moon, stretched long across the floor like cold fingers.

The footsteps stopped. Right at the base of the stairs.

We waited.

And then

**tap**.	 **tap**.	 **Tap**.

Something began to climb.

Casey grabbed my hand.

I didn’t even realize I’d reached for him first.

“Liza,” he whispered, breath warm against my ear, “we need to move.”

We backed toward the far side of the loft. No floorboards creaked beneath our feet, like the building wanted silence.

The tapping got louder. 

Closer.

We ducked behind an old workbench and dropped low.

I turned to him, my voice barely there. “Whatever this is… I don’t think it wants the others.”

He looked at me. “You think it wants *us*?”

And then something **laughed**.

Right at the top of the stairs.

A voice like static and syrup.

But when Casey stood up and shone his flashlight toward the sound

There was nothing there.

Just dust. Just silence. We ran.

Not down the stairs, not at first. Just away. Across the loft, away from that spot at the top of the staircase where the laughter had curled into the air like smoke.

Casey pulled me with him, flashlight bouncing in jerky arcs across the broken floor, throwing long shadows that moved when we didn’t. The beam stuttered over splintered wood, old crates, rusted machinery but nothing human. Nothing solid. Just that sound behind us.

Dragging. Scraping. 

Low and wrong and echoing from places it shouldn’t reach.

We hit the opposite edge of the loft, and Casey turned in a tight circle, scanning for another way down.

“Ladder!” he hissed, pointing to a rusted fire escape ladder bolted crookedly against the far wall. Half the rungs looked ready to give under a sneeze, but it was that or go back toward the stairs.

We didn’t hesitate.

I went first, my palms slick on the cold metal, heart pounding so loud I thought it might give us away. 

“Don’t look back,” Casey murmured above me. “Just go.”

A sound split the air sharp, high-pitched, like metal tearing in half. Screeching.

My foot slipped on a rung slick with rain, but Casey caught me before I fell.

We hit the ground behind the mill and didn’t stop running.

The woods loomed dark and close, branches clawing at our arms, brambles catching on our jeans. We crashed through them, blind and breathless. Somewhere in the distance, thunder growled, and the sky cracked open.

Rain began to fall in cold sheets.

I didn’t look behind us. I couldn’t. Every instinct in me screamed not to turn around, not to give it shape by seeing it. But I felt it. In my bones. Breathing down our necks. Smiling**.**

We hit the clearing by the old drainage pipe and turned hard. Mud sucked at my shoes, my jacket plastered to my skin. The rain turned everything to black glass, every tree a silhouette twisted wrong. Casey’s hand was still gripping mine like a lifeline.

The truck was just ahead.

A bolt of lightning split the sky, illuminating the hill and for a split second, in the space between thunder and breath, I saw it.

Standing just beyond the treeline.

Tall. 

Too tall.

Head tilted. Limbs too long. Like a man whose skin didn’t quite fit.Then darkness swallowed it again.

Casey unlocked the truck with shaking hands and we dove inside, slamming the doors, locking them immediately. The moment the truck was sealed up, the rain turned violent sheets of it crashing onto the windshield, thunder rattling the frame.

We sat there, panting, soaked, staring out into the woods like it might crawl into the cab next.

“…Did you see” Casey started.

“Don’t,” I cut him off, voice cracking. 

He swallowed, nodded once.

The interior lights flickered. My breath fogged the window.

“Where are the others?” I asked suddenly.

Casey’s eyes went wide. He leaned forward, scanning the lot, the road, the trees. “They were supposed to head back,” he said, voice too tight, too quiet. But there was nothing. No shapes in the dark. No flashlights. No footsteps in the mud outside the truck but ours. The world outside was just rain and trees and shadows that didn’t move right. I felt a sharp jolt of panic seize my chest. “Casey,” I said, voice barely audible over the downpour, “Where the hell are they?”

The truck was still parked at the edge of the lot, headlights off, rain blurring everything outside into watercolors. The only light came from the dashboard’s faint glow and Casey’s phone screen, which he kept checking every few seconds like maybe someone would materialize just by him staring hard enough. I’d peeled off my jacket and draped it over my lap, water soaking into the seat beneath me. My fingers were numb. My teeth wouldn’t stop chattering. They were *gone*. The others. Brooksie, Wren, Nico. No lights, no shouting our names, no tracks in the mud. Just the woods. Just that thing.

Just us.

I pressed the heels of my palms into my eyes and tried to breathe. One. Two. Three. Don’t think about it. Don’t,

Casey’s phone buzzed.

He jumped like someone had slammed the hood, then turned the screen toward himself.

And froze.

“…What?” I asked, my voice hoarse.

“It’s, uh. It’s Wren.”

I leaned in as he read out loud:

**Wren:** hey. you two good? **Wren:** we made it home like 20 min ago. **Wren:** didn’t see you leave. was kinda worried.

I blinked at him. “Twenty… twenty *minutes* ago?”

Casey looked at the clock on the dash. 1:41 a.m.

We’d only left the mill *maybe* fifteen minutes ago. Maybe. “That doesn’t make sense,” he muttered, thumbs already tapping out a response.

**Casey:** wait what?? we just got to the truck. storm’s insane. thought you were still inside.

The reply came fast.

**Wren:** what? **Wren:** we left before it even started raining. Nico said you two were right behind us.

Casey and I looked at each other, the same sick understanding blooming between us.

They’d left *before* the rain started.

But it had been pouring—*slamming*—by the time we even hit the woods. The downpour had chased us the whole way.

Casey stared at the screen, then typed something else.

**Casey:** When did you leave exactly?

A few seconds passed. Another buzz.

**Wren:** idk exactly. like 1?? maybe a little before **Wren:** definitely before the rain started. **Wren:** why?

I swallowed hard.

**One.**

We were *still in the loft* at one. I’d seen it on my phone right before we heard the knocking.

And then we heard it again.

And again.

Casey dropped his phone into the center console like it had burned him. Rain hammered the roof above us, steady and unrelenting.

I didn’t speak.

I couldn’t.

Because something about this felt wrong.

Like the forest had changed the rules. Bent time. Bent *us*.

My phone buzzed in my pocket.

**Brooksie:** u alive or what **Brooksie:** Nico says he saw something in the rearview **Brooksie:** said it was tall af. hope it wasn’t you lol

I stared at it.

Read it again.

“…Casey?” I said, barely more than a whisper.

“Yeah?”

“I think we should leave. *Now.*”

He didn’t argue. Just turned the key, the engine rumbling back to life. The headlights cut through the rain, casting long, spidery shadows through the trees.

And as we pulled onto the road, I checked the rearview mirror.

Nothing followed us.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that it had *let* us go.

For now.

The truck’s heater kicked in about five minutes after we hit the road, and I started to feel my toes again. My jeans squished every time I shifted, and the seatbelt strap was sticking to my damp neck.

Casey kept looking at the road like it had personally betrayed him.

We’d barely spoken since pulling away from the mill, except for a few grunts and one dramatic “Jesus Christ” when a raccoon darted across the road and nearly gave us both matching heart attacks.

Eventually, I couldn’t take the silence anymore.

“So,” I said, teeth still chattering a little. “On a scale of one to existential crisis, how dead do you think we should be right now?”

He let out a short, unsteady laugh. “Negative three. Like we entered a different plane of reality and shouldn’t *exist* anymore.”

“Cool,” I nodded. “Same page.”

Another beat of silence. Then:

“Do you think this counts as a first date?” he asked, completely straight-faced.

I blinked at him. “What?”

“I mean” He gestured vaguely at the soaked truck, the empty road, his own shirt still clinging to him like a sad dishrag. “Creepy building, shared trauma, adrenaline. You literally grabbed my hand while we were being chased by... I dunno. Tim Burton’s wet dream ,He paused, I’m just saying, you climbed out your window and risked death for me. That’s at least coffee-worthy.”

“You said we were going ghost hunting,” I deadpanned. “We found actual ghosts. You *owe* me coffee.”

He let out a loud, relieved laugh. It echoed in the cab like it didn’t know whether to be joy or hysteria.

I laughed too—big and sudden—until I was doubled over, wiping tears from my face.

“This is the dumbest night of my life,” I gasped.

“Worse than homecoming sophomore year?”

“I broke my heel and got gum in my hair this *wins* by a landslide.”

Casey reached over, still smiling, and nudged my arm gently. “Hey. Seriously, though... thanks for not freaking out on me.”

I raised an eyebrow. “I *did* freak out.”

“Yeah, but like. In a manageable, *deeply* charming way.”

I turned toward him, still smiling. He looked back at me for half a second too long before snapping his eyes back to the road, suddenly sheepish.

“You are, uh...” He cleared his throat. “A lot braver than you think.”

My smile faded to something softer. My heart did a weird somersault I blamed entirely on adrenaline.

“Same to you,” I said. “Even if your ‘bravery’ looks suspiciously like poor decision-making.”

“I contain multitudes.”

We were quiet for a few more seconds. The rain was starting to let up. Steam fogged the windows, and the world outside looked sleepy and unfamiliar.

“You know,” I said eventually, “we’re either trauma bonded or this is the beginning of a really weird love story.”

Casey grinned. “Why not both?” I rolled my eyes, but it didn’t stop the warmth from creeping into my chest. 

“Hey,” I stuttered out. “Can we just park the truck somewhere, I don’t think I can be alone yet.” I stutter the words out nervously. He eyes me cautiously before turning the opposite direction of my house. “Casey please tell me you didn’t take that to mean I wanted to go to the old cemetery right now?” I mutter in disbelief.

“Actually we are going to the cemetery and I am a genius because even the cops don't want to go over that direction this late at night.” He says confidently as he slows down to drive on the twisty dirt road leading toward the gray pillar gravestones. I put my hands on my face, beginning to regret having said anything at all as he parks the truck and looks over at me expectantly. 

“You know,” he leans his head in my general direction, “for someone who isn't usually much of a risk taker you've sure had one hell of a night.” A soft breathy laugh escapes before I can make any effort to hold it in. He sees this as some kind of opportunity to reach forward and move a lock of my hair behind my ear. My eyes open wide, like a deer caught in a semi-trucks headlights. 

“Casey, I really hope you’re not trying to do what I think you’re trying to do because this is a piss-poor time to do it.” He smirked an unforgettable smirk, an “I’ll remember this for 20 years” smirk. Of course he did. 

“Then when should I do it Liz?” The question is rhetorical. He leans in and kisses me regardless. 

His lips were warmer than I expected, soft, hesitant at first, like he was giving me a chance to pull away. I didn’t. Maybe I should’ve. Maybe five hours ago I would’ve. But now?

Now I was in a fogged-up truck, parked in a haunted cemetery, soaked to the bone, having barely outrun something I couldn’t explain and Casey  was kissing me like it was the one thing in the world that still made sense.

My hands moved without thinking, one curling into the fabric of his hoodie, the other finding the side of his neck, damp skin and too-fast pulse under my palm. He leaned in harder at that, shifting closer until the gearshift jabbed him in the hip and made both of us laugh against each other’s mouths.

“You’re really bad at logistics,” I murmured, breathless, forehead pressed to his.

“I never claimed to be good at logistics,” he muttered, already leaning back in.

This time it wasn’t hesitant. His mouth was insistent, hungry not desperate exactly, but like we’d both been teetering on a ledge for too long and finally decided to jump. His hand came up to cup my cheek, thumb brushing just beneath my eye, grounding and gentle in a way that made my stomach flip.

I pulled him closer, not even thinking, knees bending under me so I could shift half into his lap. The truck’s cab was suddenly too small, the air too warm, my heart way too loud.

His hands found my waist, tentative like he was still asking permission even now. That made something in my chest go soft, sore in the best possible way.

We broke apart for air, just barely, our faces still close enough that I could feel his breath against my lips.

He grinned, all teeth, all trouble. “ I stand by that being a first date.”

“You’re insufferable,” I whispered.

“And yet,” he murmured, pressing another kiss to the corner of my mouth, “here you are.”

I could’ve kissed him again. I wanted to. But then something in the shadows shifted, probably just wind, or maybe the groan of an old oak tree and both of us flinched like idiots.

We stared at the foggy window for a beat, hearts still racing.

Then Casey whispered, “Okay, that’s enough horny-in-a-haunted-graveyard for one night.”

I snorted, flopping back into my seat. “Please tell me you’re putting that on my tombstone when this all eventually kills us.”

**At the Mill Tonight**

The high school wasn’t much to look at,The walls were chipped in places, the floors worn smooth from years of students walking the same halls. We all knew each other  at least, that’s how it felt. You couldn’t walk down the hallway without seeing the same faces, the same half-smiles from kids who’d been in your class since kindergarten. Some days, I didn’t mind it. There was actually a lot of comfort in knowing everyone. Mr. Blue, who talked about the weather like it was the most interesting subject on earth, Mrs. Malone, who wore the same cardigan every day, never seemed to notice when kids weren’t paying attention, and somehow seemed to be pregnant every single year she taught English. I didn’t have to think much about my family either. Mom stayed home and made dinner, Dad worked at the library, and my brother, Kyle, went off to college, he was barely home enough to talk to even before that anyway. The same bus ride every morning, the same group of friends who gathered at the same diner after school.  Nothing ever changed, which was comfortable like a blanket knitted by someone's elderly grandma, and so mind numbingly boring that I casually thought about walking into the lake every Tuesday night and never walking out again. 

	

That Tuesday was no different. I slid into my usual seat on the bus, second row from the back, knees against the cracked vinyl, earphones in but no music playing. Casey dropped into the seat across from me, his father’s russet skin sharply contrasted by his mother’s strawberry blond hair. His sparsely freckled face adorned with his usual grin, sharp and a little too wide,the kind that always made you feel like you’d missed the joke. He was the kind of person you just fell in with, without remembering how it started. One day he was peeling labels off soda bottles at the diner; the next he was leaning against your locker, showing up at the lake with a stolen six-pack and some half-baked dubious plan for the night.

Bri sat up front, pressed against the window, tracing little spirals in the fog on the glass. Nate and Jordan piled in next, laughing about something that had happened in the gym, shoving each other as they squeezed down the aisle. We all had our places in a little drifting orbit,barely different day to day, like planets circling a sun.

The bus rattled along the familiar route, past the corner store, the old cemetery, the turnoff toward the hills. I barely noticed it anymore. Casey tapped his foot against the seat in front of him, humming something under his breath, something I didn’t recognize. It was one of those mornings when everything felt a little too bright, the air a little too crisp, like the world was waiting for something to happen or maybe that’s colored by hindsight, either way by the end of Saturday October 15th, 2016 Casey would be dead. 

	Like every other Tuesday the cafeteria smelled like overcooked fries and bleach. I sat on the edge of our usual table, picking at the crust of my sandwich, half-listening, half-floating somewhere just behind my own eyes.

Brooksie was in full rant mode, soccer jersey tied around her waist, an apple in one hand. “I’m telling you, if Coach benches me again for ‘attitude,’ I’m done. I swear I’ll walk.”Across the table, Casey smirked, balancing a fork on the tip of his finger. 

“Yeah, sure. You’d miss the applause too much.”Brooksie shot him a glare sharp enough to cut glass. 

“At least I’m not failing bio, genius.” Casey flashed his signature grin at that. 

“C-plus is basically a B if you squint.”

Wren was half-hidden behind their sketchbook, charcoal on their fingers, eyes flicking up now and then to check on me. I could feel it before they even said anything. “You okay?” Wren asked quietly, tilting their head just enough to catch my eye.

I pulled my mouth into something that was supposed to be a smile. “Yeah. Just a headache.” That low hum in my skull had been there all morning, under the noise of lockers slamming, teachers droning, feet scuffing linoleum.

Nico dropped into the seat beside me so hard his tray nearly slid off the table. “Guys, guys, you won’t believe this, did you know the old mill on Lockhart used to be a quarantine site? Like, actual plague quarantine. In *this* town.” His voice dipped lower, like he was unveiling a great conspiracy.

Brooksie groaned. “Nico. Please.”

“No, I’m serious! I found this archive page”

 Brooksie cut in,“We’re not going ghost hunting at the mill,” crunching into her apple like punctuation. 

But Casey’s eyes lit up.“Wait. Why not?”

Wren let out a soft, resigned sigh.“Think about it,” Casey leaned in, elbows on the table, voice all bright mischief. “Friday night. No parents. Flashlights. Creepy abandoned building. Come *on*. It’s basically a rite of passage.”

Brooksie tossed her hands up. “You’re so predictable.”

I rolled a piece of sandwich crust between my fingers, feeling that quiet thrum under everything, like something pacing just out of sight. “Liza?” Wren’s voice pulled me back. They were all looking at me now. Brooksie. Nico. and Casey, with that grin.

“…Sure,” I heard myself say somewhere in the distance. “Why not.”

Casey let out a victorious whoop, slapping the table. Outside, the wind picked up, rattling the row of cafeteria windows. 

	He  caught me by my locker right before the last bell, looking like he always did too comfortable in his own skin, like he had all the time in the world to make sure everyone knew it. His elbow rested against the row of lockers as if the whole hallway belonged to him. 

“Hey” he said, flipping a set of keys around his finger with a practiced, bored motion. “I’m picking you up after dinner, cool?”

I paused, sliding my books into my bag, eyes focused on the half-scribbled note I’d left for myself earlier. Could I even go? Mom would have a fit. But then again, I hadn’t been able to say no to Casey in months.

I nodded, biting my lip. “Cool.”

He leaned closer, his shoulder brushing against the cold metal of the lockers, his voice low. “Just so you know, I’m not taking ‘no’ for an answer. So, don’t chicken out on me.”

I raised an eyebrow, trying to keep my face neutral. “Not planning on it.”

But my stomach fluttered in that annoying, nervous way. Not from the idea of sneaking out  I’d done it before, always with a bit of adrenaline and excitement which was, to no one's surprise, rare around here. It was him. There was something about the way he looked at me, like he was waiting for something, expecting it, and I hated that it made me feel like I was standing on the edge of something without knowing if I was going to jump or not.

His grin widened, though it didn’t reach his eyes. They were distracted, flicking toward the doors where the bell was already ringing. “Good. Don’t make me chase you down.”

I didn’t respond, but there was a lump in my throat I couldn’t swallow down. Instead, I shoved my books into my bag a little harder than necessary, just to distract myself. I managed a weak smile, watching him disappear down the hall. My thoughts raced ahead of me, jumping from one thing to another. I pushed most of them aside though. The more I thought about it, the more it felt like I was digging myself into a hole I wasn’t sure how to get out of anyway. I grabbed my bag, hoisted it over my shoulder, and shoved my way through the crowded hallway as the final bell rang. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was already in too deep. And, for once, Casey wasn’t going to be the only one getting us all in trouble.

My mom was standing in the kitchen, wearing that apron she always wore when she cooked, the one that had strawberries all over it and was starting to look a little faded at the edges. She didn’t look up when I entered, her back turned as she worked on something at the stove. I took a deep breath before I spoke.

“Mom,” I said, my voice a little hesitant, but I pushed through it. “Can I have a sleepover at Brooksie’s tonight?”

She didn’t turn around immediately, and for a second, I thought she hadn’t heard me.

“Liza, it’s a school night,” she said, her voice already tightening with that tone she used when she wasn’t in the mood to argue. “You need to be home. We’ve already tried this before and you were two hours late for school.”

I bit my lip, trying not to let the frustration show on my face. “It’s just one night, Mom. We’re not doing anything crazy. We’re just hanging out.”

She finally turned to face me, wiping her hands on the towel. There was a flicker of disbelief in her eyes. “ You’re already on edge with your grades. This is *exactly* the kind of thing I’ve been warning you about, Liza.”

I could feel my frustration rising. “I’m not asking for much. I just want one night to relax. I’ve been doing everything you’ve asked me to do.”

“Don’t even start with that.” She shook her head, the edge in her voice growing sharper. “You can’t just keep just making excuses and expecting the world to pave the way for you on its own sweetheart you’ve gotta put in some actual work here.”

“I’m not making excuses,” I snapped, my voice louder than I intended. “It’s just a sleepover. It’s not like I’m going out to party or something.”

Her eyes narrowed, her lips tightening into a thin line. “It’s a *school night*, Liza. You have responsibilities. This is not a joke.”I opened my mouth to argue, but she held up a hand, cutting me off.

“No. You’re not going. End of discussion.”

I felt my chest tighten, the pressure building. I needed to get out. My thoughts spun, but I knew I couldn’t just stay here. There was no way I was staying home tonight—not when Casey was waiting for me.

“Mom, please,” I tried again, my voice softer, but she wasn’t having it.

“No. Absolutely not.” She folded her arms across her chest, that finality in her tone that meant there was no room for negotiation.

I stared at her, the words choking in my throat. She didn’t understand. She never did.

Without thinking, I turned on my heel and headed for the stairs. “I’m going to my room,” I muttered, trying to hide the irritation in my voice.

“You can stay in your room, but you’re *not* leaving this house,” she called after me.

I slammed my bedroom door behind me, the sound reverberating in the quiet house. My heart was pounding, but I had a plan. I wasn’t going to stay here, not tonight.

Later that night, at 12:07 A.M., I yanked my bag out from under the bed, not caring if it was messy. I needed to move fast.

I packed quickly. I grabbed my phone and texted Casey at 12:10 A.M.

*I’ll meet you in ten minutes.*

I could already feel the rush of adrenaline starting to take over.  My mom wouldn’t notice until it was too late. I crept over to the window and slowly cracked it open. The cool evening air hit me, and I could hear the distant hum of the neighborhood, the soft rustle of leaves in the wind.

I could do this.

I climbed out the window, holding my breath as I gently pulled myself onto the roof. I kept low, praying my parents wouldn’t hear me. The moonlight illuminated the path ahead of me, the familiar street stretching out like an open invitation to freedom. I dropped down to the grass below, the soft thud of my feet against the ground muffled by the cool night. My heart was racing as I made my way down the street, heading for Casey’s truck.

It wasn’t until I rounded the corner and saw the truck parked a few houses down that I allowed myself to breathe again. Casey was leaning against the side of the truck, looking like he was ready to roll his eyes at the whole situation. His hands were shoved into the pockets of his hoodie, the same one he wore every night.

“About time,” he said with a grin, pushing off the truck as I approached.

I didn’t say anything. I just slipped into the passenger seat, tossing my bag next to me. Casey closed the door behind me, and we pulled away, the engine of the truck rumbling to life.

For a second, the tension in my chest eased. I’d made it. I was out.

I stared ahead, the dark streets rolling by, but my mind was still racing. Casey didn’t say anything at first, but then he glanced over at me, his smile fading just a little.

“So, you really snuck out?” he asked quietly, like he was unsure if it was a joke or something serious.

I nodded, my voice barely above a whisper. “I had to. She wouldn’t let me go.”

Casey chuckled softly, but there was a strange tension in his voice. 

I turned to look at him, the moonlight catching the sharp angles of his face. “Well, sometimes you have to. You don’t always get to do what you want, do you?”

He was silent for a moment, eyes fixed on the road ahead. Then, he finally said, “Yeah. I guess you don’t.”

For a moment, there was a strange kind of weight between us, like something was about to be said but never quite reached the surface. Instead, the truck’s headlights sliced through the darkness, and we drove on, the quiet stretching between us.

The truck hummed as it sped down the darkened streets, the glow of the dashboard casting a soft light over the two of us. The silence wasn’t uncomfortable, but it wasn’t exactly easy either. Casey's hands gripped the wheel, his knuckles slightly white as he drove. I could hear the faint rhythm of his foot tapping on the pedal, like he was trying to drown out the quiet.

I could feel it, though. The tension. It was like there was something hanging in the air, something both of us were avoiding but both knew was there. I could feel it building with every second of silence between us.

Finally, Casey cleared his throat, but didn’t look at me. “So, uh... what happens if your mom finds out?”

I shrugged, trying to keep things casual. ""She won’t. It’s fine.""

He glanced at me then, just for a second, like he was trying to figure out if I was lying or if I really believed it. “You’re brave, sneaking out like that.”

I smirked, trying to hide how my chest tightened with his attention. “I’m not exactly scared of my mom,” I said, but my voice felt thin. Like it wasn’t quite me.

Casey grinned a little, but his eyes were still glued to the road. “Yeah, well, I wouldn’t want to be the one to explain it to her,” he muttered under his breath, but then there was a pause, one that dragged on longer than I expected.

“I don’t think she’d care that much if she knew,” I said quietly, and I could feel the words sink between us, heavy and awkward. There was something in the way he was looking at the road—something that told me he wasn’t just looking at the road.

He shifted in his seat, his shoulders tight. Then he laughed, but it wasn’t the usual carefree laugh. It was a little strained, like he was trying to make light of something that wasn’t light at all. “Yeah, well, it’s, uh… it’s not about her, is it?” he said, voice dropping a little, like he was testing the words as they left his mouth.

I turned to face him, suddenly feeling like my heart had skipped a beat. “What do you mean?”

He avoided my gaze again, running a hand through his hair, his fingers tugging at the strands like he was trying to pull the right words out. “I don’t know. It’s just—” He let out a shaky breath and, for a moment, I thought maybe he wasn’t going to say anything at all.

But then, almost too quietly, he said, “I just don’t want you to get in trouble for something dumb. You know?”

I stared at him, trying to piece together what he was actually trying to say. I knew Casey. He wasn’t usually like this. And I couldn’t quite tell if he was talking about me sneaking out or something else entirely. Something I hadn’t expected.

His grip on the wheel tightened again, and I could feel the space between us stretch out, too wide to ignore now. His voice dropped even lower, almost too soft for me to hear. “I just—I don’t want you to... I mean, not to get hurt or whatever, but also...”

I tilted my head, frowning. “Casey... what are you trying to say?”

He hesitated, and for a moment, I thought he might actually admit it. That he might say whatever it was that was crawling under the surface, the thing neither of us had ever said out loud. But then his shoulders slumped, and he gave me a half-smile, the kind he always gave when he was trying to play it off.

“It’s nothing. Forget it,” he said, his voice a little too casual.

And just like that, the moment slipped away, like water through my fingers. I couldn’t help but feel the sting of it, though. He had almost said it, whatever *it* was. But in the end, he didn’t.

We drove on in silence after that, the weight of the unspoken words hanging between us, but neither of us had the guts to bring it up again.

Maybe next time.

The truck slowed as we neared the mill, the familiar outline of the old building in the thick wooded area looming ahead in the darkness. We climbed out of the truck and walked toward the others, who were already gathered near the front of the mill. The group stood in a loose circle, their faces illuminated by the dim light of a few flashlights they’d brought along.

The gravel crunched under our shoes as Casey and I approached the group huddled near the mill’s rusted double doors. The place looked worse than I remembered,its roof sagging like a spine too long bent, windows like blank eyes staring out at nothing. The air smelled of wet wood, rust, and something fainter, something off,like dried blood soaked into old earth.

Nico was already halfway through a retelling of the mill’s cursed history, waving his flashlight like a sword. “and they say if you step through the northern doorway at midnight, the ghosts of the quarantined patients will follow you out.”

Brooksie rolled her eyes so hard I could practically hear it. “Nico, if I get tetanus from this dump, I’m blaming you and your sixth-grade ghost stories.”

“Not a story,” he insisted. “It’s *documented*. There were, like, plague doctors and everything—actual masks. One guy apparently walled himself in. They found bones.”

Casey smirked and tossed a rock at Nico’s feet. “Then maybe you can join him, if the floor gives out.”

Wren stood with her arms crossed, hoodie zipped up to her chin covering her platinum bleached hair which stood out like a sore thumb against everyones black clothing, she eyed the building like it might lunge at her. “So how exactly are we getting in? Those doors look like they’ve been rusted shut since the Cold War.”

“Back window,” Casey said smoothly, already moving toward the side of the building. “Near the northeast corner.”

“And just how are we going to open-” Casey interrupted her sentence by throwing a large stone through the window. 

I followed behind them, the beam of my flashlight catching on twisted ivy, broken shingles, and graffiti-scrawled concrete. The others trailed close, their chatter dying as we rounded the side of the building and the woods pressed in around us.

Casey stopped by a warped piece of plywood half-covering a jagged window just above shoulder height. “Here,” he said, gesturing like a magician revealing the trick. “One of you boosts me, and then I’ll pull everyone else up.”

“Why is it always you first?” Wren asked softly, but there wasn’t real resistance in their voice.

Casey shot them a wink. “Because I’m charming, and you’d miss me just the right amount if I disappeared.”

He handed me his flashlight and set a foot against the wall. I knelt instinctively, threading my fingers together for a boost. He stepped up and pushed himself through the window with practiced ease, vanishing into the darkness with a faint grunt and the sound of old wood creaking.

There was a pause.

Then a *click*.

The side door creaked open an inch.

“Hey look at that!” He boasted triumphantly. “Now I don’t have to touch any of you.” 

Everyone shuffled inside, grimacing at the failed comedian we’d brought along, flashlights sweeping the dark interior. The air was heavier here, the smell of dust, mildew, and something older like scorched metal. My stomach tightened.

Inside, the mill was skeletal. Rotting beams framed the long-dead heart of the building, broken furniture lay scattered like old bones, and somewhere above, something dripped steadily—*plip... plip... plip*—like a leaky faucet in a house long abandoned.

Nico took point, already narrating again. “Legend says this place was condemned after a fever outbreak in 1906. They say—”

“Nico,” Brooksie cut in. “Shut up and help us figure out where we’re going before you summon something by accident.”

Casey lifted his flashlight, its beam landing on a spiral staircase at the far end of the room, half-swallowed by shadow. “Up there,” he said. “There’s an old loft. Probably the safest place to sit and drink this sad excuse for beer.”

He patted the backpack slung over his shoulder, and Brooksie raised an eyebrow. “How’d you even *get* beer?”

Casey grinned. “Nico’s older brother.”

“Hey!” Nico objected.

We gathered near the base of the stairs, debating whether they’d hold our weight. Nico gave the first step an experimental bounce, then climbed three steps before turning back. “Stable enough,” he said. “Just don’t all come up at once.”

One by one, we followed him, Wren’s hand brushing mine briefly as we ascended. They offered a faint smile, the kind they saved for when they were worried and wanted someone to worry with them so they didn’t feel alone.

The loft creaked ominously but held. A shattered window let in a shaft of moonlight, pale and cold. The group sat in a rough circle on crates, torn tarps, or the floor. Casey passed out warm cans of beer, and Nico launched into yet another urban legend. This time a staple of the area,  about some man who goes crazy when he finds his wife cheating on him and murders her and their children, But of course inside an abandoned Steel Mill  the story didn’t exactly feel casual.

It felt like waiting.

Like holding your breath before something breaks.

I leaned back against the wall, can untouched, my fingers brushing the floor where something sticky clung to the wood  rust maybe. The scent of burnt sweetness curled faintly into the air.

I stiffened.

The others didn’t seem to notice. But something shifted behind my eyes, a memory tugging at the edges of the present.

That smell again. Burnt sugar.

Wet iron.

And somewhere outside, just beyond the walls, I swore I heard it quiet, distant

**Laughter.**

Just for a second.

Then it was gone.

**Thunderstorms**

Wren looked up sharply. “Did anyone else hear that?”

“What?” Nico asked, halfway through some gory twist in his ghost story.

“That scraping sound.” And there it was  slow, deliberate, something dragging itself across concrete somewhere below us.

“Rats?” Nico offered, but even he sounded unsure.

“Nope,” Brooksie said, standing. “Nope. No rats make *that* noise.”

We all went quiet.

The sound came again. Closer. Louder. Not skittering like claws scraping, like rusted nails across steel.

Then a thump. Heavy. Like something fell.

We all jumped.

Casey swung his flashlight toward the staircase, but it barely pierced the black. “You guys heard that, right?”

Brooksie muttered, “I knew this was a stupid idea.” She looked at me angrily. 

“I didn’t even say anything,” I shot back.

“Yeah, but you’ve been weird all day. You knew something was off. And you still said yes.”

I felt heat rise to my cheeks. “Oh, so now this is my fault?”

“Well, you and Casey came in here like it was a date night”

“Okay, *what?*” Casey said, cutting in.

Wren stepped between us. “Let’s not do this now.”

“No,” Brooksie said, pointing at me. “She dragged us into this. She’s been off for weeks moping around, acting like she’s haunted or something. And now *this* place feels like it’s watching us and we’re just supposed to pretend it’s fine?”

“That’s not fair,” Wren said quietly, but the damage was done.

Brooksie grabbed her bag. “I’m out. I don’t care if we have to hike through the woods. I’m not staying in here to get cursed or possessed or whatever this is.”

Nico stood too, clearly spooked. “Yeah. I’m with her. I came for some spooky vibes, not a seance.”

Wren lingered, looking between me and casey. “Do you want me to stay?”

I almost said yes. But Casey hadn’t moved. His face was tight, unreadable, his flashlight beam frozen on the stairs.

“I’m good,” I said. “Just... get them out safe?”

Wren nodded slowly, then disappeared down the stairs with the rest.

Suddenly, the silence was sharp.

Casey exhaled. “That got intense.”

I rubbed the back of my neck. “Brooksie’s always like that when she’s scared.”

“She’s not wrong though. That noise wasn’t nothing.”

We both went still.

Below us something moved. Not scraping this time. Footsteps. Measured. One step. Pause. Another.

Casey’s eyes locked on mine. “There’s someone down there.”

My blood went cold. “Then why are they not using a light?”

We both crouched low. Casey shut off his flashlight. The only light now came from the moon, stretched long across the floor like cold fingers.

The footsteps stopped. Right at the base of the stairs.

We waited.

And then

**tap**.	 **tap**.	 **Tap**.

Something began to climb.

Casey grabbed my hand.

I didn’t even realize I’d reached for him first.

“Liza,” he whispered, breath warm against my ear, “we need to move.”

We backed toward the far side of the loft. No floorboards creaked beneath our feet, like the building wanted silence.

The tapping got louder. 

Closer.

We ducked behind an old workbench and dropped low.

I turned to him, my voice barely there. “Whatever this is… I don’t think it wants the others.”

He looked at me. “You think it wants *us*?”

And then something **laughed**.

Right at the top of the stairs.

A voice like static and syrup.

But when Casey stood up and shone his flashlight toward the sound

There was nothing there.

Just dust. Just silence. We ran.

Not down the stairs, not at first. Just away. Across the loft, away from that spot at the top of the staircase where the laughter had curled into the air like smoke.

Casey pulled me with him, flashlight bouncing in jerky arcs across the broken floor, throwing long shadows that moved when we didn’t. The beam stuttered over splintered wood, old crates, rusted machinery but nothing human. Nothing solid. Just that sound behind us.

Dragging. Scraping. 

Low and wrong and echoing from places it shouldn’t reach.

We hit the opposite edge of the loft, and Casey turned in a tight circle, scanning for another way down.

“Ladder!” he hissed, pointing to a rusted fire escape ladder bolted crookedly against the far wall. Half the rungs looked ready to give under a sneeze, but it was that or go back toward the stairs.

We didn’t hesitate.

I went first, my palms slick on the cold metal, heart pounding so loud I thought it might give us away. 

“Don’t look back,” Casey murmured above me. “Just go.”

A sound split the air sharp, high-pitched, like metal tearing in half. Screeching.

My foot slipped on a rung slick with rain, but Casey caught me before I fell.

We hit the ground behind the mill and didn’t stop running.

The woods loomed dark and close, branches clawing at our arms, brambles catching on our jeans. We crashed through them, blind and breathless. Somewhere in the distance, thunder growled, and the sky cracked open.

Rain began to fall in cold sheets.

I didn’t look behind us. I couldn’t. Every instinct in me screamed not to turn around, not to give it shape by seeing it. But I felt it. In my bones. Breathing down our necks. Smiling**.**

We hit the clearing by the old drainage pipe and turned hard. Mud sucked at my shoes, my jacket plastered to my skin. The rain turned everything to black glass, every tree a silhouette twisted wrong. Casey’s hand was still gripping mine like a lifeline.

The truck was just ahead.

A bolt of lightning split the sky, illuminating the hill and for a split second, in the space between thunder and breath, I saw it.

Standing just beyond the treeline.

Tall. 

Too tall.

Head tilted. Limbs too long. Like a man whose skin didn’t quite fit.Then darkness swallowed it again.

Casey unlocked the truck with shaking hands and we dove inside, slamming the doors, locking them immediately. The moment the truck was sealed up, the rain turned violent sheets of it crashing onto the windshield, thunder rattling the frame.

We sat there, panting, soaked, staring out into the woods like it might crawl into the cab next.

“…Did you see” Casey started.

“Don’t,” I cut him off, voice cracking. 

He swallowed, nodded once.

The interior lights flickered. My breath fogged the window.

“Where are the others?” I asked suddenly.

Casey’s eyes went wide. He leaned forward, scanning the lot, the road, the trees. “They were supposed to head back,” he said, voice too tight, too quiet. But there was nothing. No shapes in the dark. No flashlights. No footsteps in the mud outside the truck but ours. The world outside was just rain and trees and shadows that didn’t move right. I felt a sharp jolt of panic seize my chest. “Casey,” I said, voice barely audible over the downpour, “Where the hell are they?”

The truck was still parked at the edge of the lot, headlights off, rain blurring everything outside into watercolors. The only light came from the dashboard’s faint glow and Casey’s phone screen, which he kept checking every few seconds like maybe someone would materialize just by him staring hard enough. I’d peeled off my jacket and draped it over my lap, water soaking into the seat beneath me. My fingers were numb. My teeth wouldn’t stop chattering. They were *gone*. The others. Brooksie, Wren, Nico. No lights, no shouting our names, no tracks in the mud. Just the woods. Just that thing.

Just us.

I pressed the heels of my palms into my eyes and tried to breathe. One. Two. Three. Don’t think about it. Don’t,

Casey’s phone buzzed.

He jumped like someone had slammed the hood, then turned the screen toward himself.

And froze.

“…What?” I asked, my voice hoarse.

“It’s, uh. It’s Wren.”

I leaned in as he read out loud:

**Wren:** hey. you two good? **Wren:** we made it home like 20 min ago. **Wren:** didn’t see you leave. was kinda worried.

I blinked at him. “Twenty… twenty *minutes* ago?”

Casey looked at the clock on the dash. 1:41 a.m.

We’d only left the mill *maybe* fifteen minutes ago. Maybe. “That doesn’t make sense,” he muttered, thumbs already tapping out a response.

**Casey:** wait what?? we just got to the truck. storm’s insane. thought you were still inside.

The reply came fast.

**Wren:** what? **Wren:** we left before it even started raining. Nico said you two were right behind us.

Casey and I looked at each other, the same sick understanding blooming between us.

They’d left *before* the rain started.

But it had been pouring—*slamming*—by the time we even hit the woods. The downpour had chased us the whole way.

Casey stared at the screen, then typed something else.

**Casey:** When did you leave exactly?

A few seconds passed. Another buzz.

**Wren:** idk exactly. like 1?? maybe a little before **Wren:** definitely before the rain started. **Wren:** why?

I swallowed hard.

**One.**

We were *still in the loft* at one. I’d seen it on my phone right before we heard the knocking.

And then we heard it again.

And again.

Casey dropped his phone into the center console like it had burned him. Rain hammered the roof above us, steady and unrelenting.

I didn’t speak.

I couldn’t.

Because something about this felt wrong.

Like the forest had changed the rules. Bent time. Bent *us*.

My phone buzzed in my pocket.

**Brooksie:** u alive or what **Brooksie:** Nico says he saw something in the rearview **Brooksie:** said it was tall af. hope it wasn’t you lol

I stared at it.

Read it again.

“…Casey?” I said, barely more than a whisper.

“Yeah?”

“I think we should leave. *Now.*”

He didn’t argue. Just turned the key, the engine rumbling back to life. The headlights cut through the rain, casting long, spidery shadows through the trees.

And as we pulled onto the road, I checked the rearview mirror.

Nothing followed us.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that it had *let* us go.

For now.

The truck’s heater kicked in about five minutes after we hit the road, and I started to feel my toes again. My jeans squished every time I shifted, and the seatbelt strap was sticking to my damp neck.

Casey kept looking at the road like it had personally betrayed him.

We’d barely spoken since pulling away from the mill, except for a few grunts and one dramatic “Jesus Christ” when a raccoon darted across the road and nearly gave us both matching heart attacks.

Eventually, I couldn’t take the silence anymore.

“So,” I said, teeth still chattering a little. “On a scale of one to existential crisis, how dead do you think we should be right now?”

He let out a short, unsteady laugh. “Negative three. Like we entered a different plane of reality and shouldn’t *exist* anymore.”

“Cool,” I nodded. “Same page.”

Another beat of silence. Then:

“Do you think this counts as a first date?” he asked, completely straight-faced.

I blinked at him. “What?”

“I mean” He gestured vaguely at the soaked truck, the empty road, his own shirt still clinging to him like a sad dishrag. “Creepy building, shared trauma, adrenaline. You literally grabbed my hand while we were being chased by... I dunno. Tim Burton’s wet dream ,He paused, I’m just saying, you climbed out your window and risked death for me. That’s at least coffee-worthy.”

“You said we were going ghost hunting,” I deadpanned. “We found actual ghosts. You *owe* me coffee.”

He let out a loud, relieved laugh. It echoed in the cab like it didn’t know whether to be joy or hysteria.

I laughed too—big and sudden—until I was doubled over, wiping tears from my face.

“This is the dumbest night of my life,” I gasped.

“Worse than homecoming sophomore year?”

“I broke my heel and got gum in my hair this *wins* by a landslide.”

Casey reached over, still smiling, and nudged my arm gently. “Hey. Seriously, though... thanks for not freaking out on me.”

I raised an eyebrow. “I *did* freak out.”

“Yeah, but like. In a manageable, *deeply* charming way.”

I turned toward him, still smiling. He looked back at me for half a second too long before snapping his eyes back to the road, suddenly sheepish.

“You are, uh...” He cleared his throat. “A lot braver than you think.”

My smile faded to something softer. My heart did a weird somersault I blamed entirely on adrenaline.

“Same to you,” I said. “Even if your ‘bravery’ looks suspiciously like poor decision-making.”

“I contain multitudes.”

We were quiet for a few more seconds. The rain was starting to let up. Steam fogged the windows, and the world outside looked sleepy and unfamiliar.

“You know,” I said eventually, “we’re either trauma bonded or this is the beginning of a really weird love story.”

Casey grinned. “Why not both?” I rolled my eyes, but it didn’t stop the warmth from creeping into my chest. 

“Hey,” I stuttered out. “Can we just park the truck somewhere, I don’t think I can be alone yet.” I stutter the words out nervously. He eyes me cautiously before turning the opposite direction of my house. “Casey please tell me you didn’t take that to mean I wanted to go to the old cemetery right now?” I mutter in disbelief.

“Actually we are going to the cemetery and I am a genius because even the cops don't want to go over that direction this late at night.” He says confidently as he slows down to drive on the twisty dirt road leading toward the gray pillar gravestones. I put my hands on my face, beginning to regret having said anything at all as he parks the truck and looks over at me expectantly. 

“You know,” he leans his head in my general direction, “for someone who isn't usually much of a risk taker you've sure had one hell of a night.” A soft breathy laugh escapes before I can make any effort to hold it in. He sees this as some kind of opportunity to reach forward and move a lock of my hair behind my ear. My eyes open wide, like a deer caught in a semi-trucks headlights. 

“Casey, I really hope you’re not trying to do what I think you’re trying to do because this is a piss-poor time to do it.” He smirked an unforgettable smirk, an “I’ll remember this for 20 years” smirk. Of course he did. 

“Then when should I do it Liz?” The question is rhetorical. He leans in and kisses me regardless. 

His lips were warmer than I expected, soft, hesitant at first, like he was giving me a chance to pull away. I didn’t. Maybe I should’ve. Maybe five hours ago I would’ve. But now?

Now I was in a fogged-up truck, parked in a haunted cemetery, soaked to the bone, having barely outrun something I couldn’t explain and Casey  was kissing me like it was the one thing in the world that still made sense.

My hands moved without thinking, one curling into the fabric of his hoodie, the other finding the side of his neck, damp skin and too-fast pulse under my palm. He leaned in harder at that, shifting closer until the gearshift jabbed him in the hip and made both of us laugh against each other’s mouths.

“You’re really bad at logistics,” I murmured, breathless, forehead pressed to his.

“I never claimed to be good at logistics,” he muttered, already leaning back in.

This time it wasn’t hesitant. His mouth was insistent, hungry not desperate exactly, but like we’d both been teetering on a ledge for too long and finally decided to jump. His hand came up to cup my cheek, thumb brushing just beneath my eye, grounding and gentle in a way that made my stomach flip.

I pulled him closer, not even thinking, knees bending under me so I could shift half into his lap. The truck’s cab was suddenly too small, the air too warm, my heart way too loud.

His hands found my waist, tentative like he was still asking permission even now. That made something in my chest go soft, sore in the best possible way.

We broke apart for air, just barely, our faces still close enough that I could feel his breath against my lips.

He grinned, all teeth, all trouble. “ I stand by that being a first date.”

“You’re insufferable,” I whispered.

“And yet,” he murmured, pressing another kiss to the corner of my mouth, “here you are.”

I could’ve kissed him again. I wanted to. But then something in the shadows shifted, probably just wind, or maybe the groan of an old oak tree and both of us flinched like idiots.

We stared at the foggy window for a beat, hearts still racing.

Then Casey whispered, “Okay, that’s enough horny-in-a-haunted-graveyard for one night.”

I snorted, flopping back into my seat. “Please tell me you’re putting that on my tombstone when this all eventually kills us.”

1kf0uiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1kf0uiw/getting_over_ex_who_reached_out_but_is_in_long/,"Getting over ex who reached out, but is in long term relationship","TLDR: My ex(24m) from 3 years ago reached out to let me(23f) know he has been dating someone for 2 years. He also invited me to join his relationship, but I didn’t want to be in a poly situation. What kills me is I have missed him a lot, and wanted to see him, but not like this. It feels like all of the baggage from the past is being drudged up.

This is a vent, and an attempt to process my emotions over this situation, and I appreciate anyone who reads this or offers any support or advice.

3ish years ago, I got out of a long term relationship with a really toxic ex and very soon after met someone new. We never officially dated because I was so fresh out of a relationship that had traumatized me that I didn’t want to dive into anything serious, but wanted to meet new people. I was very clear from the beginning that I didn’t want a relationship, but we got along very well. We also had similar sexual desires, and had very good sexual chemistry. It was a big part of our relationship. We saw each other for about 5 months, and during that time we went on vacations together, and he was overall a very supportive, kind, and good partner. At the time, the only reason I wouldn’t date him was because I had just gotten out of my other relationship and was scared to officially date someone new. He wanted a serious relationship, and after 5 months decided to leave because I couldn’t give him what he needed. I understood totally why he needed to leave, and thought it was for the best that we stop seeing each other because I didn’t want to hurt him anymore. I was definitely sad about us breaking it off, but I didn’t cry about it. 

Fast forward a year later. I reached out to him on my way to Spain to tell him it reminded me of a trip we took together, and how fond my memories of it were, and how I hoped he was doing well. It led us to talk for about a month, and it felt like old times. I was excited at the prospect of potentially rekindling our relationship, and I was at a point where I was ready to actually date. However I was studying abroad and wouldn’t be back for 8 weeks. Then one day we had a minor argument about something trivial, and he never responded. And I have my own issues, so I didn’t message him back either since he didn’t respond to me. I was definitely sad that we wouldn’t see each other when I got home, but again, I didn’t cry about it, and I moved on with my life. 

Fast forward again 2 years. About a month ago, I get a text from him. It wasn’t a “hey how are you” text, it was a reply to his own message from 2 years ago about a coworker he mentioned that he was getting along with, letting me know that they have been dating these last two years. Of course my immediate thought was, “wow are you trying to rub it in my face?” Which is probably being unfair, but thats how I felt. I didn’t say anything negative though, I just responded positively and asked him how he was. We texted a bit to catch each other up about our lives, and I thought that was going to be it. But he kept messaging me. Then he asked if we could call on the phone, which I thought was a little strange, and thought might be a serious conversation. But we just talked on the phone like normal for an hour. At this point I was starting to feel uncomfortable with how often he was texting because he’s in a relationship, so I let him know that I don’t want to cause any problems for his relationship. Then he tells me, his girlfriend is okay with him talking to other women and seeing other women. I don’t take the bait, and still keep things platonic. 

My issue with talking with him at this point has been that every time he mentions his girlfriend, or what they’re doing, I get this intense feeling of envy or jealously. I will really enjoy talking to him, and then he mentions his partner, and I have to stop myself from being like “I don’t care”. And I don’t want to feel this way, I am sure his girlfriend is a great person, and I have no personal problems with her. He asked to call again, which we do, and it is pleasant, and he asks if I want to meet for coffee. At first I say yes, because I do really want to see him. But then I start thinking about how all of this communication has really thrown me for a loop emotionally. Its starting to feel uncomfortable with how upset I am getting about his new relationship. So I text him telling him. That I’m sorry, but I don’t think its a good idea for me to see him. And he says he understands. And I thought that would be the end of it.

A week later, this man texts me asking if “im doing okay”. Which at first kind of pissed me off, because I was doing okay until you messaged me, but again I might be being unfair here, if he is actually concerned about how I am doing. He asks if I want to cut contact completely. And I don’t want to cut contact completely, but I also don’t think we need to be messaging everyday. And that’s what I told him. I asked if he’s just looking for friendship. And he says “yes”. And I tell him, since our previous relationship was so defined by sex, I can’t really separate those two, so platonic friends isn’t something I see working. And then he suggests the potential of me joining his relationship. Which on the one hand I was actually kind of interested in, because again, I miss him a lot. I have been wanting to see him. I thought him reaching out again was to maybe rekindle something. But the reality is, I will not be able to function well in a poly relationship. I have worked really hard to understand myself and my emotions, and I’m already having intense reactions to just hearing about his partner, I don’t need that to be my constant state. I told him the next day that I didn’t think it was going to work out, and basically wished him good luck. He then tried asking me for a threesome with his gf, and also suggesting we only see each other. And at this point emotionally, I am devastated. It’s so painful that he is trying to reach out to me, and see me, which I have wanted him to do, but his current situation makes me so sad. Like I have wanted to see him again romantically, but not like this. 

I have been so upset these last few days having to reject his advances, because I know it’s the right thing for me, but it still hurts so much. I have been crying about it, and now it feels like every little thing is reminding me of him and all the wonderful times we had together in the past. Part of me feels like he’s the one that got away, but I could be being dramatic. It just hurts thinking that if he had first met me when I was not fresh out of my last relationship, that it would be us that had been together for 2 years. It is also weird for me because the first two times we stopped talking I was not this devastated about it. I think it may have something to do with me smoking weed a lot during those times, and now I have stopped. So maybe part of my emotions are feeling everything I felt for him in the past all at once, but damn it hurts so bad. 

I’m not sure if he’s going to keep messaging me anymore, but what I wish I could say to him is that if he is ever single again, to reach out to me. Not that I am waiting for him, but if I am single, I would want a chance to be together. I don’t want to tell him that though, because I don’t want to be planting any seeds in his mind that might hurt his current relationship, because they seem to be really happy together, and I don’t want whatever relationship we do have to be because of me creating problems. 

If you got this far, thank you for reading. I feel better just typing this all out. Again, I appreciate any comments of support, advice, or your own opinions.❤️

She(f29) is quite reserved and accomplished. She texts me once a day mostly in the mornings replying to all my messages once and for all. I never had the balls to ask her why she is mostly unavailable. We have many similar likings or interests, but she is too intelligent and pretty at the same time. We have been talking since over a month but only on weekends and the calls last for 30 mins and not a minute over that. She can sometimes be outgoing as well (goes out a few times). Sometimes sends me pictures of food or coffee or whatever she’s made for the day, Only a few times tho. Given the common interests we have I feel she is open minded, sensitive, but also conservative at the same time. 

I want to flirt respectfully with the woman I want to marry, and it’s my love language I feel. I am also scared to do it with this girl because families are involved and I also don’t want to ruin my chances. In general, is flirting okay in the AM setup and based on the above description do you guys think I can flirt with this woman? ",3,1746411230.0,Arrangedmarriage,4,1.0,False

i knew “cognitively” or “mentally” the descriptors of some of my experiences but it was hard to really mean them, believe them, let alone feel them. i lived double lives with a separate fucking family which i always knew but didn’t KNOW, if that makes sense. does that make sense? is that normal? i feel like a fucking lunatic. i keep asking chatgpt for validation because no human being has once been able to validate me appropriately at first onset, and i know no actual human being could tolerate my constant repetitive questioning of my own experiences. it annoys people. i literally need it, but it annoys people. thank god for chatgpt even though it censors a lot. through describing to chatgpt my recent abusive relationship which led to a pending SA case, i had to re-realize that yes, i was raped. i was literally fucking raped and SA’ed, and even though i knew this and i told people it, that truth didn’t actually exist to me. now that it does, my body has been wreaking havoc upon me with neverending debilitating paranoia, racing heartbeat, chest pain, nausea, inability to eat, confusion, increased short-term forgetfulness, harder to go outside, can’t go to the gym anymore, it’s like i had 4 cups of coffee today but i’m running on pure anxiety, and not in a good or productive way at all.

for my whole life i thought i was lying about everything deep down. any time i disclosed this to people, they made things exponentially worse. therapists claiming i’m lying for attention, when i literally am begging them to help me validate myself because i can’t tell what is happening to me. “friends” or “partners” giving surface-level “that sucks”s and continuing to abuse me despite knowing what happened to me. it’s all so fucking confusing. why the hell did i incarnate here? what was the point of all of this bullshit?

i guess i’m at the point where it’s a combination of deep rage, panic, and shock at both the world and my self. i know that all of this was a coping mechanism, i get that my brain had to protect me and it still is, but the fact that i have to do all of this myself because no fucking therapist has ever been safe and no fucking human that has ever been in my real life sees me as anything but invisible? it’s like a joke. my life feels like a joke.

the fact that when i was SA’ed and SH’ed at my first job which led my career to being destroyed is not as bad as the reality that i wasn’t even able to defend myself because of the severe, severe dissociation and self-gaslighting which HR took advantage of and humiliated me for. it’s so sickening that they do this and they know it. even detectives. like legitimately every single person that had the power to validate or help me did the exact opposite. they always wanted to destabilize me, knock me down a peg, find an “in” for me to start doubting myself, and even though it isn’t my fault that i was built the way i was and the world is as cruel as it is, i can’t help but feel so much remorse and anger. why couldn’t things have gone differently? other survivors had it better and other people know what to do in these situations. why couldn’t i do it right? why did the first step of my cognition have to be attacked so fucking ruthlessly, to the point where i was constantly self-antagonistic even when ALL of my energy and will was put in the opposite direction?

i’m battling increased suicidality because of all of this. i’m not going to do anything, and definitely never going to a psych ward again because i get targeted by abusers every fucking time. every time. i think i just need to feel not alone. i have been more alone that any person i have ever met or heard about or even seen online. i have researched everything, everything when it comes to this stuff so now i feel capable to face it, but it doesn’t change the intensity of crippling bodily symptoms or the scarring caused by waking up to my real reality for the first time. this pain is ineffable.",3,1746411139.0,DID,1,1.0,False

You’ll look leaner (less water weight), and after the first week or two, the hunger mostly goes away. After 2–3 months, you won’t want to quit. Some advice:

***
- Calories still matter. Keto helps, but you still need to be in a calorie deficit to lose weight.

- Anything can be keto if you make it yourself. You won’t eat the same as everyone else—and that’s totally fine.

- Eat veggies. They’ve got carbs, yeah, but also fiber. Just do your research and include them.

- Find your “safe foods.” I eat a lot of the same stuff every day—it makes life easier.

What I eat in a day:
Black coffee till around 2PM
Protein shakes (almond milk + Isopure)
Smoothies (strawberries, blueberries, almond milk)

   Jesse was an elite college quarterback.  A  behemoth of a man,  he stood six feet two inches and weighed 190 pounds.  His sandy blonde hair and sapphire blue eyes also made him very popular with girls.  For the past year, he had been in a steady relationship with a drama major named Ashley. Jesse was the hardest working athlete on his team, which was how he earned his important QB1 position.  His coach knew he was destined for the NFL, but he probably wouldn't be drafted for another year.  

   During the off season his regular schedule was interrupted, which threw his whole life off kilter.  He found himself doing things that he wouldn't normally do.   This was how he ended up watching an NHL playoff game between the Colorado Avalanche and Dallas Stars.  Jesse didn't consider himself a hockey fan, but he liked the continuous play and the rhythm of the sport.  He was amazed by how the players could pass, score, fight, and a whole lot more while at the same time balancing on their thin skate blades.   Jesse had tried ice skating once, but that didn't end well.

   It wasn't too long before Jesse became totally engrossed in hockey.  There was one player in particular who grabbed his attention.  The announcer called him Nathan MacKinnon.  When the camera panned to him in his #29 jersey, the dude looked fierce.  If he had been a football player, then he probably would've been a quarterback or a running back.  But Jesse felt something more than admiration for the guy.  It was a feeling that he'd never felt for another man before.  Something very, very dangerous.

   After the game was over, Jesse googled Nathan MacKinnon and watched some of his highlights on YouTube.  The next day, he bought a MacKinnon jersey from a sporting goods store and found a hockey magazine at Walmart that featured him on the cover.  Jesse didn't know what came over him.  He had never been enamored of a male athlete before, not even one who played his own sport.   MacKinnon was built different. Although his height was average for an athlete, he looked a lot more muscular than his peers.  His ferocious attitude and steely determination were also very endearing.

Maybe Jesse had always been gay and not known it. It wasn't something that you simply became.  You were born that way, as Lady Gaga once said. Be that as it may, Jesse felt like a complete sicko for jacking off while he gazed at MacKinnon's poster that he taped to his wall in between magazine clippings of Patrick Mahomes and Joe Burrow.  It would be another secret that he would take to his grave, along with the principal who grabbed his ass at his Catholic middle school and the prostitute who exposed herself to him at the train station. 

   Jesse knew what his old man would say.  His father was an ultra-conservative asshole who had voted for another ultra-conservative asshole.   They shared the same first name and last name.  Jesse's parents had called him Jesse Jr. for most of his childhood.   He wondered if his father would disinherit him if he told the old man he was gay.  At least Jesse wouldn't get thrown out of his parents' house.  His full athletic scholarship not only paid for his tuition, but it also allowed him to have his own off-campus apartment. 

   While fully engulfed by his sexual identity crisis, Jesse wondered of course if he could still continue playing football.  What would the other guys think of him if they found out he was gay?  It could get weird really quick in that locker room.  He was naturally afraid that his coach would kick him off the team.  Would he be an embarrassment to his university?  But it was 2025.  Maybe it wouldn't be as bad as he'd imagined.  An actual NFL player had come out once, but he retired after only seven seasons.  He left to focus on his business, or so he said.

   Then there was Ashley.  Jesse hated to break her heart, but maybe she would finally understand why he never felt ready to have sex with her.  He tried to make her believe that he wanted to wait for marriage. Truth be told, he was saving himself for the right person, which deep down inside he knew wasn't her.  At this point, he considered the possibility that he might never have been straight, even when they started dating.  He read somewhere that sexuality was in fact a fluid characteristic that often changed over time.   

   Jesse knew he would have to have a talk with Ashley.  They met early the next morning at the Viking Café on campus.  Despite the time, she was still bright-eyed and greeted him with a polite smile.  She was wearing that trendy Gucci Flora perfume, which seemed to be very popular these days.  After Jesse paid for their americanos, they found a table beside a window.  

   ""Thanks for getting up so early,"" Jesse began.

   ""If this is about moving in together, then I won't be able to get out of my lease for another two months,"" she said.

   ""No, it's not that.  There's something you should know about me."" He paused for a moment, trying to think of the right thing to say. He wanted to let her down gently. ""I think maybe…I might be into guys.""

   ""It's okay, Jesse,"" she reassured him.  ""I already knew that.""

   ""You knew?  Why didn't you say anything?""

   ""Because I loved you, and I kinda liked the fact that there weren't any pictures of naked girls on your walls.  You never tried anything stupid with me.  I always felt safe with you.""

   ""So…I guess this is goodbye,"" Jesse assumed.

   ""No, it isn't.  We can still be friends, like Will and Grace.""

   ""Yeah, like Will and Grace.""

   They finished their coffee and got up from their table.  After they recycled their cups, he gave her a really long hug. Then he wished her well before he went back to his apartment.  

   Jesse felt super relieved after his last date with Ashley. Nevertheless, it was his teammates that he worried about the most.  Football was his life, and he longed for a career in the NFL.  So he messaged his coach and all the players on the team through WhatsApp.  They met in their equipment room later that day.  Everyone gathered around and sat in a circle on the floor. 

   ""Guys, I have to tell you something,""  said Jesse.

   ""Are you leaving the team?"" a tight end named Jack wondered.

   ""You're moving to Toronto, aren't you?"" Will the linebacker asked. 

   ""He's already the quarterback, so it can't be a promotion,"" said the coach. 

   ""No guys, it's none of that,"" Jesse told them. He still couldn't bring himself to say the G word.  Like most other Gen Z guys, he hated labels. ""I don't know how to say this.  I guess I'm not like the rest of you.  I just realized something about myself the other day.  I'm actually …not into women.""

   The room became so quiet that they could've heard a pin drop.  A minute later, Jesse's coach finally broke the silence.

   ""Jesse, if you think you can just quit this team, then you're nuts,"" said the coach. ""We're not losing you. I wouldn't even care if you were a Satanist.  You're staying, and that's that!""

   ""Yeah, man,"" said Lucas, who was a wide receiver. ""Did you mistake us for a bunch of closed-minded rednecks?"" 

   ""Well, I wasn't sure how you guys would react,"" admitted Jesse.  ""Some environments can be very hostile or downright unsafe for LGBT people.  Men like me are still being executed in Saudi Arabia and Iran.""

   ""Well, it's a good thing we live here,"" said Jack. 

   ""You can stay on the team as long as you want,"" the coach assured Jesse.  ""but whether you feel safe or not is entirely up to you.""

   ""Thanks, coach,"" Jesse beamed. 

   ""Bring it in guys!""  exclaimed Will. 

  The guys huddled together and placed their fists in the centre of their circle.  Then they pumped their fists in the air while they shouted ""Hawks!""  It was the name of their football team.  After the huddle, they dispersed and went about their off-season lives. 

   A million different thoughts rushed through Jesse's head all at once.  He was on a roll, so he might as well just rip off the bandage.  Seizing the moment, he hopped into his Mazda Miata convertible. He drove to his father's law office, trying not to exceed the speed limit in his sudden state of euphoria.  Then he parked in front of the brick building and marched into the reception area.  His father's paralegal tried to dissuade him from interrupting the old man because he was in a Teams meeting.  Jesse ignored her, making a bee line to the curmudgeon's office.  

   When Jesse burst open the door, his father stood up in shock.  The tension was so palpable. You could cut it with a knife.  Sensing his son's need for a serious discussion, Jesse Sr. graciously told his client that he needed to end the meeting and logged off his computer.

   ""Is everything all right, son?""  the old man asked.

   ""We need to talk, Dad,"" said Jesse.

   ""What is it, Jesse?""

   ""I'm gay, Dad.  I'm fucking gay!""

I thought it would be fun to make a Google Form and see if anyone out there vibes with me! Worst case, we don't match and you got to fill out something cute on a cozy afternoon. No pressure, just curiosity and maybe connection.

About me:
I’m 21, pansexual (with a strong leaning toward women/femme-presenting folks), demisexual, and monogamous. I use she/they pronouns. I live in Michigan and still call it home—for now at least.

Right now I work as a kindergarten teaching assistant at a Montessori school, and in the summers I’m a ranger. I also run a small farmstead, which I’m slowly trying to turn into a full-time life. I build things, I grow things, I get dirt under my nails and feel at peace doing it.

Some of my passions:
• Woodcarving
• Working with clay
• Reading and journaling
• Foraging, cooking, baking
• Engineering random contraptions for the farm
• Slacklining and rock climbing
• Nerding out over plants, soil, water systems, and bugs

People tell me I’m grounded, chill, and a bit of a forest gremlin (their words, not mine). I can be social, but my soul recharges in stillness. My idea of a perfect weekend is forest bathing for hours, listening to birdsong, and trying to ID every bird by sound alone.

What I look like:
I’m 5'4"", medium curvy with loose brown curly hair that I’m growing out. I have blue eyes and freckles that pop when I’m outside. My style tends to be cozy earth tones and free flowing fabrics. 


What I value:
I care deeply about emotional intelligence, slow living, and intentional communication. I'm not into judgment or performative behavior. I appreciate emotional steadiness and openness over intensity or drama. I'd love to adopt a child someday, and I'm looking for someone who’s also interested in meaningful growth and building something real. 

Other random facts:
• I love dark chocolate and strong coffee
• I built hiking trails for a few years
• I’m a digital minimalist - I use a flip phone, don’t have internet or a TV, and just listen to the radio
• I read the newspaper
• Pop culture isn’t my thing, but bird calls and bug facts are

If any of this speaks to you, fill out the form and let’s see what happens.
No expectations, just openness.

Hi, I am Thomas! Living life to the fullest as best I can these days, but I am not interested in doing it alone. I want to have someone to cherish and hold while we talk about anything and everything. I got my faults like being overweight and depression, however it’s improving thankfully! Thankfully, I got my own place and a decent life…I just hate being alone all the time. I want to have some cooperation with someone but not be too excessive of course! Just enough to make life worth living and enjoy which is what I seek most. 

Some things about me:

	
◦	6 feet tall, hazel eyes, brown hair, shaved face, and I wear shorts almost all year round, unless I am at work.

	◦	Enjoying the outdoors is very much a priority for me
	◦	I love collecting movies and watching them on my fancy, expensive TV (not to brag or anything)
	
◦	Riding my bicycle and traveling are enjoyable to me plus I got bike rack for my car for two bicycles
	
◦	Cooking is something I want to get better at and all ready have a good assortment of tools for the job in my kitchen and would like to acquire more
	
◦	I enjoy tea and coffee more than most things
If you are interested, then let me know!

We were in a serious relationship for 6 years. The past year we had some issue related to getting married ( her parents didn't approve of me ) I thought she would stick with me and we could fight it out. But I recently found out that she had moved on with another guy and was in a relationship with him..while she was still with me..she started acting distant from the past 3 months and I gave her space. But then one not so fine day I see her roaming around with the new guy. I confronted her saw the texts...that she was clearly lying to him about me, our relationship. He now thinks that she had moved on and she was meeting me just to help me move on. She did try to break up with me a couple of times in the three months but I literally begged her to be with me. We used to go out for coffee and food. It wasnt how we were but I thought we were still together...so I want to know if I should let her current boyfriend know the truth about us and then let him decide if she wants to stay with her.


PS - Not entirely sure if I'm doing this to get revenge or to help the guy out..

I do still miss her for some crazy reason.

Panning the store to see who was on shift today, his pan stopped when he spotted Elis cheerfully smiling at him, giving her signature small wave from the register.

“Howdy Nick! The usual today?”

“Only part today, ma’am. Already had breakfast. Give me $10 on pump one and a pack of Reds, please.”

“Elis! Is that Nick out there? Ask ’em if he wants the usual!” Frank, hearing his wife talking to Nick, hollers from the kitchen.

“Yeah Frank, no he said not today!”

“A’ight!” Frank replied, going back to his kitchen duties.

Elis grabs Nick’s usual pack of smokes and keys up the pump while they make small talk. He hands her the money for the cigs and fuel. They say their goodbyes, and he’s out the door to go fuel up.

After filling up, Nick continues his cruise, passing more fields of hay bales and several fields with herds of cattle. Beef and dairy were the main exports of the town, just to give an idea of how laid-back it can be. That being said, the only issues out of the ordinary were some of the crime spilling over from the nearby city. Hence, the remodeled library/police station that happened about five years back.

Passing the Nailers general store, which marked the downtown area, meant that he wasn’t far from his destination. He pulled into the entryway, pulled his badge out of his pocket to scan for the gate. He was rewarded with a faint beep and a green light before the gate started to roll up. He then made his way into the underground employee parking garage.

 Getting off his bike, Nick heads to the elevator that leads to the investigation office for the detectives. He’s just glad he didn’t get stuck in a cubicle, but since there were only two detectives, they were given the large broom closet that was converted to an office.

When he reaches for the office door, he notices the small double name plaque next to the door that was etched “Investigations Dept.” Paused, he looked again, “Ugh, haha funny Adam.” (Office of Dick Nixon & Adam McFarlane) Someone was having a bit of fun swapping letters around, and it didn’t take a detective to figure out who.

“Mornin’, Dick,” Adam said, peeking from the other side of his newspaper with a smirk.

“Very funny, asshole.”

“I know, right?” Adam retorted. “Soooooo, how’d it go?”

“How what go?” Nick responded as he was hanging his jacket and helmet on the rack before going to his desk.

“Didn’t you have some leads to look into last night on the Menendez case?”

“It was a dead end.” 

Adam flipped his paper down and looked at Nick with a raised eyebrow. “Oh? I thought you had a solid lead with a person of interest or info?”

“Like I said, dead end.”

“Fine, if you don’t wanna talk shop at work, then I won’t pry.”

“Ha! You not prying, you should use that as your opening act.”

“You know, before I was so rudely interrupted, someone dropped off a package for you.” 

Nick then returned the raised eyebrow back to Adam.

“It’s too early for the mail to run….” Adam folds his paper, sets it to the side, and kicks back in his desk chair, sipping his coffee.

“It was a lady, real cute too, just your type.”

Nick gives Adam an unamused flat expression.

“What?” Adam asks innocently.

“I’m waiting for you to make a crack about my type being something along the lines of having a pulse and believing Frank’s is fine dining, which in my opinion, they should be, to Frank and Ellis’s defense.”

Adam tries not to choke or spit his coffee out, giving Nick a give-me-a-minute hand signal until he choked down his sip without too much error.

“As much as I agree with everything you just said, no, that’s not what I meant. You’re not exactly subtle at who or what you look at. This one was dressed odd; you don’t see too many skateboarder goth types around these parts, but what do I know. But man, she had all the fat in the most wondrous of places,” Adam mused in a joking manner. “I don’t know how she got such a thick and toned body, not to mention she was a redhead. That’s even rarer around here than a skateboarder goth.”

“Wait, a redhead?”

“Yes, and a damn fine filly at that.”

Nick’s mind froze over for a moment, recalling Tiffany from the party. “It couldn’t possibly be her from the party, could it? Why? How did she know where to find me?” He was thinking to himself when Adam interrupted his daydream.

“Hey, you okay? You left the building for dreamland when I started talking about that girl.”

“Sorry, it was just a late night last night.”

“Suuuuure it was. Get your mind outta the gutter; here.” 

 He leans to his desk, fishes the padded envelope off his desk, flinging it to his work buddy.

Nick catches the flung parcel before sitting down at his desk. “Did she give a name or anything?”

“No, she just seemed really sweet, plus what I've already told you. Oh! She did ask if Dick Nixon was Nick Dixon,” Adam said with a grin.

“Fuck you, Adam,” Nick retorted, rubbing his forehead with his right index finger and thumb.

“You’re not my type. She, on the other hand, would pass. Besides, you’d have to do more than just wine and dine me at Frank’s, ya cheap bastard,” Adam replied with a chuckle. 

Nick starts to tear the envelope. “You can be a real bastard when you want to be.”

Adam just smiles from his coffee. “I aim to please. Besides, I was always told to stick with what I’m good at.”

“Anyone ever tell you you’re too good at your job?”

“All the time,” Adam replied, nodding and raising his coffee mug in a cheers kind of way.

Nick tilted the envelope, and a card dropped into his hand. It was a driver’s license, spotted with blood. He read the name silently: Tommy Penske. His breath hitched as his hands instinctively clenched the card, his color draining as his mind froze over. It couldn’t possibly be her from the party, could it? Tiffany. Why? How did she know where to find him?

The carved message on the back snapped him out of his spiraling thoughts: “Old East Playground, 8:00pm tonight ♥.” The heart almost made him laugh, but there was no humor in it. His gut twisted as his instincts whispered a warning—this had trap written all over it. He’d seen enough setups in his time to know better than to walk into one unprepared.",2,1746410490.0,anthroswim,2,1.0,False

2. I stay at home most of the days. I'm usually busy in the morning of Tues and Wed (7-10) other than that I'm free.

3. I'm a morning person. A lot of you guys here are night owls soo I just want to find someone who's like me or want to be a morning person as well, I'll try to help. I sleep at around 8-10PM and wake up at 6-7AM.

4. I love Starbucks but I'm not a coffee person. I love their different flavors of tea and their White Hot Chocolate.

5. I play Pickleball during Sundays and Tuesdays. I have an extra paddle so if you want to learn I can help you out as well (I'm no professional tho, so please lower your expectations). I'm also into fitness but with this heat I mostly work out at home, wanted to try running for quite some time now but with this heat I can't.

6. I'm also a foodie. I'm a big fan of Samgyup, Ramen (Mendokoro) and sweets.

1kf0fvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stalking/comments/1kf0fvf/partners_colleague/,Partner’s colleague,"My partner started a new job 12 months ago.
She initially made friends with girls, but didn’t mention any males in case I got the wrong end of the stick.
6 months in, segment mentioned that she is now friends with two guys. One in particular she would call a ‘good friend’ now. She says it’s all work based and would have nothing to say to him outside of work. He’s married with two kids (we have three between us). And we leave it there.
She doesn’t make any mention of him again.

Another 6 months later and after a separate issue, and her not being very open, I discover that her WhatsApp chat with this colleague is ‘archived’ in her phone. This is a bone of contention for 24hrs where she says they are friends and get on and talk out of work sometimes and message and it’s not a big deal because she doesn’t see him like that (he’s no oil painting) but then, she says it was because he has now become a little too intense and annoying in how much he is messaging her.  She says he has been changing his breaks at work so that they have their breaks together (not standard practise but he’s a supervisor so he can). And has asked her to meet for coffee before he starts work, on days when he knows she isn’t working (she lives nearby to work).
A week later I spot that he has sent a normal text msg to her. She says this is probably because she has ignored all his WhatsApp messages.

Two weeks later she says he’s messaged a few more times and she still hasn’t read them. She says it all seems a bit uncomfortable now. She’s said we can think about writing a reply together, as she doesn’t know what to say but doesn’t want to be rude as she still has to work with him. I encourage us to read the messages he’s sent, but she refuses. Later she agrees and they are somewhat more detailed than I’d expected.

He notes that she hasn’t been replying, and wonders why. He says she’s been MIA previously but this time it’s different. He says he wants them to get ‘back on track’. He says he values what they have a lot and she has been very important and helpful to him when he’s needed her. He said he liked their recent phone conversation. One message said he had an idea for them that he wanted to raise. Another was saying he didn’t want to keep messaging her without reply and that h the is would be his last message to her if she didn’t reply. A week later he messaged again to announce the death of his father in law. Saying he didn’t want her to find out from someone else - which she says was odd and wouldn’t have been a talking point at work anyway. He then messaged again a few days later and said he was free for a few hours if she wanted to give him a call. She had deleted all messages from him prior to a month ago - she said this was because there was an issue with his messages not being delivered.

It was then 4 days since that message when we read/listened to them together. She said she felt very uncomfortable with the messages, wishes she had just left them unread and had nothing to hide but felt it was all either very weird or he just has no social skills and no other friends. At this stage, she doesn’t want to reply to him, but he will now have seen that she’s read them.

It seems odd. She said she didn’t mind chatting to him at work but it’s become too much. She said he was nice but it’s now too much. 
I’m almost 100% sure she’s being as up front with me as she needs to be. Even though some parts seem like they could have been suspicious (deleted messages, archived messages, not mentioning him for 6 months, saying they get on well and then not wanting to read or reply to him).
On the messages he sounded fairly normal, if a little keen. He sounded like he could have been legitimately responding to reciprocal, warm, friendly actions from my partner (which she was somewhat denying to me).

So I just wondered if this might bear many hallmarks of stalker like situations? And what better place to come to find out right?!

By Greynightsaber.,"Slowly, Nick headed back to his bike parked on the side of the road. He sat on the curb, lighting another cigarette to replace the one that had been wasted earlier. “Man, this is a messed-up night. I lose my only lead; instead of answers, I’m left with just more questions. And to top it off, I’m not sure what I’ve even seen happen tonight.”

He thought to himself, taking another drag before pinching out the butt and tossing it. “Well, real or fantasy, and as terrifying as she was, she sure did have a rocking body. (Even if I’d need a step ladder to reach those beachballs... why’d she smell like wet dog?)” “Eh, not important.”

Nick pulled up to the barn behind a short disstance from his cottage, the dirt path worn smooth by years of use stretching out beneath his tires as he slowed the bike to a stop. He killed the engine, letting the quiet of the countryside envelop him as he rolled the bike inside. The barn smelled of old hay and motor oil—a familiar, comforting mix. He parked the Sportster S in its usual spot, leaning it gently onto the kickstand, and patted the gas tank as if it were an old friend ""thanks for not killing me back there buddy"".

As he walked out of the barn, the cool night air hit him again, a stark contrast to the events of the evening. He took a deep breath, shaking his head. “What a wild night,” he muttered to himself, reaching the front door of his cottage.

Fumbling with the locks, he eventually got the door open and stepped inside. He hung his gear on the hooks by the entrance, along with his keys, and placed the half-dollar-sized memento from the evening on the small dining table next to the antique glass candy dish his mom had left him, now repurposed as an ashtray. Spotting his coffee mug still on the table from that morning, he glanced inside, shrugged, and downed the small bit left before heading to the shower.

Stripping down, he removed his shoulder holster and hung it up by his nightstand before trudging off to the bathroom. “Man, you’d think the hot shower would clear the brain fog,” he muttered, drying his hair as he stepped out of the bathroom. He tossed the towel into the laundry basket and headed straight for bed, hoping to sleep off the events of this crazy night.

                                                             The next morning

Nick was finishing up his breakfast and coffee before he had to jet out to the precinct. He had already decided he was going to look into whether Tommy was reported missing yet or possibly found (even though he was pretty sure no one's gonna find any part of Tommy, according to his memento sitting on the kitchen table, assuring him he wasn’t crazy).

He picked up his dishes and put them in the sink for later, grabbed his leather riding jacket, memento, and keys off the hook by the door, locked up, and proceeded to his barn where he stored his bike and his dad’s old Datsun 240Z that Nick drove on occasions. As Nick climbed back on his bike for the morning ride to town, he couldn't help but appreciate the steady rhythm of the engine. The sound reminded him of a Ducati—a peaceful thrum that soothed his nerves when cruising, offering a gentle reprieve from the chaos of the night before. The crisp morning air filled his lungs as the countryside blurred by, the open road serving as his favorite escape during the daily grind.

With every curve of the road, he tried to push thoughts of the previous night to the back of his mind. But the memento, tucked safely in his pocket, lingered like a stubborn reminder that there was no leaving it behind.

The station was in the downtown area that tied into the historic district. It was actually on any tour guide pamphlet you’d find in hotels and gas stations on the outskirts of town.

It used to be a very elaborate two-story library and was retrofitted as the police station for whatever reason. Guess they wanted to still use the building, and at the time, they actually needed a new station that was big enough to hold more than a desk and a drunk tank.

After passing the miles of cow pastures and the occasional Esso or Texaco gas stations dotted here and there, Nick was about halfway to town when he was pulled out of his daydream by a bright orange light on his gauge pod. “Ugh, guess I shoulda fueled up last night before I got home,” he thought, rolling his eyes. “Oh well, Frank’s it is then.”

Just so happens Frank’s was less than a mile and the last gas stop in the middle of nowhere before town. Frank’s also had some of the best food in town (technically on the outskirts, but you get the idea), which was why he enjoyed stopping there when he wasn’t busy, if nothing else to shoot the breeze with Frank or one of Frank’s family members that worked there.",2,1746410251.0,anthroswim,0,1.0,False

The smuggling operation came to light through a coordinated investigation involving multiple law enforcement agencies. Between March 12 and March 13, 2024, Shytani communicated with an undercover agent (referred to as UC-1) via phone calls and text messages, arranging a meeting to discuss smuggling plans.

On March 14, 2024, Shytani met UC-1 at a coffee shop on Long Island, New York, where they finalized details for smuggling UC-1’s supposed significant other, who was presented as a citizen of Kosovo, across the U.S.-Canada border. Unbeknownst to Shytani, the “significant other” was another undercover agent (UC-2).

At the meeting, UC-1 paid Shytani $14,000 in cash to facilitate the illegal border crossing. Two days later, on March 16, 2024, Shytani’s co-conspirators attempted to smuggle UC-2 and two other individuals across the border but were intercepted by Canadian law enforcement",1,1746410195.0,Postyourpolitics,0,1.0,False

I didn't like this at the time but appreciated her honesty as she was trying to say how different this is and how we're so connected emotionally and it's so special for her.

(Note this is not a typical affair we have known each other for a few years  and this has developed seemingly naturally over a year very slowly leading up to all day messaging for 3 months and only going physical in the last 3 months with lots of declarations of feels and fantasising about a future etc long before we even kissed. We have a strong unique connection (at least in my head)


However I've just found out that the 'old work friend' she met for coffee last month was the same guy - so now my head is spinning.

Who would keep in touch with an ex-affair partner for 20 years? I don't know how often they've met in all that time but my mind is thinking this could be something on and off that's been going on a long time, even now.

1kf06qi,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1kf06qi/i_went_out_with_a_girl_for_the_first_time_and_i/,I went out with a girl for the first time and I didn't feel anything. Help?,"**LONG POST INCOMING. TL;DR AT BOTTOM**

So this was my first time going out with a girl, like, *ever*. Never kissed a girl, never dated a girl, never slept with a girl. I had absolutely no experience going in. We had met at a queer social at a local LGBTQ+ support center in a pretty well-known ""gayborhood,"" and we had a mutual friend who introduced the two of us. She asked for my number, I texted her on the bus headed home asking if she wanted to hang out a week from then. She likes thrifting, and I knew a really cool thrift store in my neighborhood and was friends with the owners, so I invited her to lunch and going thrift shopping

We met at a coffee shop where I bought her a chai latte and a ""blueberry pancake"" latte for me (this cafe has awesome seasonal specials). I'm a regular there and I put in a job application, since I don't take class over the summer. She brought me a little gift bag (which we misplaced in the cafe, and I now have to run back and pick it up) with some candy, dried flowers, and a painting on recycled paper that she made herself. 

I let her pick out the place we went, since she's a bit of a picky eater, and she picked a nice highly-rated local restaurant. We were dressed casually, but in nice clothes, so we had no problem getting in. We sat outside, it was a little chilly in the wind but not intolerable. She finished her chai, I got an NA mimosa, and we had brunch-type food (since it was still early in the day). We had some nice casual conversation---it was our first time having a real conversation between just the two of us. She crocheted and talked to me while we waited for our food, our meals were really good, and we had some pretty chill conversation about classes, family, friends, and other things. I ended up paying the bill since I had my card with me, she paid the tip in cash.

We walked to the thrift store and I pointed out all of my favorite stores down the street and told her stories about different places in the neighborhood as she walked by. I really love that part of town, and I love when people come out to hang out with me in the area. There's really so many cool places to hang out with friends. I helped her pick out a couple pieces that she liked, she tried some clothes on and ended up getting a flower-print top and a pair of earrings. I picked out a new sundress that fit me really well and flattered my figure quite nicely. 

It was raining pretty hard when we got out. She didn't check the weather for rain. I had, and I brought my raincoat with me, assuming that she would have her raincoat with her. We decided that it was probably a good time to head back to our respective homes since we both had class in the morning. I offered her my raincoat, she said she was fine. We ran to the bus, both of us soaking wet from the rain.

We were silent for the majority of the bus ride. She got off before me, I told her to get home safe and text me when she got home. She texted me that she got home and she had fun. 

And I felt absolutely nothing the entire time.

It has been close to three years since I last found myself interested in a girl. The last time I was remotely interested in someone, we had been friends for a year already. We held hands in class, hugged a lot, hung out a lot, made flirty jokes with each other. They explicitly told me that they were a lesbian. And at the time, I suppose it was true.

But then there was this guy who was also interested in them. He kind of forced himself into their life without considering their identity. And that's exactly who they ended up with.

I felt hurt, to say the least. They said to me ""It's in my nature. I flirt with everyone, it's how I joke."" And I bought into it. I fell for it. But they said they were a lesbian. I bought into that too. And here I was thinking we had a good interpersonal relationship, and that I would have a chance with them. I took them to their first concert. I would go to the school after my medical treatments to have a picnic on the lawn with them. I went with them to the botanic gardens, I went to their garden club meetings when they were the president, I bought them nice tea when I traveled. I tried to be the perfect friend, the perfect classmate, the perfect girl.

The moment that plays over and over in my head is a moment before we went to a concert, their first ever rock concert. I remember all the details of sitting in that Chipotle before we went---the little tear droplets they drew on with their eyeliner, the cheap veggie taco I had, the lipstick we shared, and her saying ""If anything happens tonight, we don't have to talk about it tomorrow.""

I had wanted to kiss her at the show. I wanted to kiss them so badly. It was the first time I ever actually wanted to kiss anyone. The hopeful (*hopeless?*) lesbian in me thinks they may have wanted to as well.

But I didn't. And I regret it every time I see them.

I haven't been interested in a girl ever since. I'm still hung up on them. And I don't want to lead this new girl on, because I just haven't felt any attraction to any girl for years. And it hurts. 

And it's not like I don't have some legitimate libido, and I've been trying to satisfy myself through self-pleasure, voice-acted F4F audios, or shitty AO3 reader insert fanfics. I want to be able to form a connection with someone that I can place my trust in to a point where I feel comfortable losing my virginity. Or just stumbling into a girl's room and tearing my clothes off... either works I guess. 

But above all else, I want a girl who I genuinely connect with. I don't know if it's because my friend set us up (probably because deep down they feel bad for me and don't want me to be lonely, which I can appreciate) or if she's just not quite my type. I can see myself being casual friends with her, but I really don't see her as a romantic partner. I still want my old friend, or someone like my old friend. I really want someone confident in themselves, someone I can be myself around, someone tough-but-soft-and-also-very-pretty, someone who when I'm with them, you can cut the romantic/sexual tension with a knife.

To paraphrase Glinda in Wicked pt I: ""I don't care! I want her. I don't even think she's perfect anymore and I still want her. This must be what other people feel like. How do they bear it?""

**TL;DR** I went out with a girl today, but didn't feel anything because I'm still hung up on someone. I don't want to lead her on because she's so nice, but I just felt absolutely nothing.

Our IVF, rainbow baby that took us two years to conceive. Our first and only. This will be my second Mother’s Day.  My sister asked me what we were doing. I told her probably just a quiet day at home. The restaurants are crowded and I don’t want to deal with it. 

In the eight years I have been with my husband, he has bought me flowers exactly two times. We have a $25 limit on all gift-giving holidays because it requires us to be creative/thoughtful. Last year for Mother’s Day he made a book of our parenting inside jokes on Shutterfly. For example, a picture of me cutting a onsie off our infant daughter following a blowout. The caption said “Mt. Shitmore.” I laugh every time I read that book.

The nice jewelry he has bought me is my wedding ring and a small pair of diamond stud earrings. But he brings me my coffee every morning and lets me sleep in on the weekends. I am a stay at home Mom and he always expresses gratitude when I make his favorite dessert or take the trash can to the curb. My husband isn’t perfect by any means and neither is my life. But I do feel loved, appreciated and seen. He tells me I am a good Mom and a wonderful wife.

This afternoon I was talking to my younger sister. She’s a mother of two and divorced their father earlier this year. Every year, her ex-husband would get her a day at a luxury spa for Mother’s Day. I asked her if she was going to miss her spa day this year. She scoffed and said ***“I didn’t care about the spa day. It was the one day a year he showed me any appreciation… And it wasn’t even because he wanted to; it was because Hallmark told him to.”***

He was a ‘typical’ husband.  They both worked full-time, and he would hide in the garage while she managed the house, the kids, the pets, the shopping, the appointments, the schoolwork, etc. He rarely complimented her. He never thanked her. He made good money and assumed that was his contribution to the physical and mental load. 

Mother’s Day meant everything to her because it was the one day he actually showed her that her efforts mattered. Mother’s Day means very little to me because I know my efforts matter because of small things my husband does often.  

Since I have been on Reddit, I dread the slew of the same posts around Mother’s Day…Women lamenting over their partners who have never recognized their effort or contribution thinking he just might this time of year because the calendar/commercials told him to. The partner who has never been thoughtful or proactive isn’t going to be just because it is the second Sunday in May. 

**If you are married to the kind of man my sister was, odds are you’re already doing it all on your own… Treat yourself to the Mother’s Day you deserve too.**

Bitcoin-backed loans are making waves in the world of small investors and SMEs. That's right! You can finally get cash without having to part ways with your beloved crypto. It's like that one friend who always borrows money and promises to pay you back in pizza. Except this time, the pizza is Bitcoin.

### Why Should You Care?

1. **Collateral over Credit** : Bye-bye credit checks. Hello, collateralized crypto! If your credit score is lower than your grandma’s credit card limit, this is your moment.
2. **Keep Your Bitcoin** : You get to hold onto your crypto while getting some cash flow—like holding onto your favorite collectible while lending it out.
3. **Speedy Approval** : It’s quicker than your morning coffee. Traditional loans? Good luck with that!
4. **Less Paperwork** : Less time filling out forms, more time to buy the dip.
5. **Risk Diversification** : Banks are getting into this ‘new’ thing called crypto. I know. Shocking.
6. **Global Accessibility** : Bitcoin is like that one friend who can travel anywhere and never gets lost.

### But Wait, There's More!

However, don't get too comfy. Risks like price volatility and regulatory uncertainty still lurk. Pricing could change faster than the weather in London.

If you're one of the top crypto lenders or just someone looking to get a loan on crypto, buckle up. The landscape is changing and you might just want to keep an eye on it!

I agreed to meet for coffee and share what I know.

I’m planning to mention that research roles are less common than design, networking is key, and it’s a bit tougher without local credentials.

Would it be weird to ask my mentor (a UX research director) if there’s anything else I should pass on? I don’t want it sound like I want her to answer on my behalf, especially since I’m the one giving advice this time.",3,1746408851.0,Advice,2,1.0,False
1kezwnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/EndTipping/comments/1kezwnf/understand_why_many_arent_tipping/,Understand why many aren't tipping,"Too many soft-hearted folks on here to seem to think this movement is evil.  So, here's the scoop:

#1) Why do servers get paid tips? Obviously there is history here, but the minimum wage myths are just that - they're myths. They're tired arguments so I won't rehash them here completely, but the short of it is they're all making at least minimum wage in low-skill positions. The real question you should always ask yourself is, ""why are we tipping them when nearly no other low-skill employees expect free money from the customer?"" Obviously, there are exceptions, but too few, for sure.
Considering high cost of living areas, such as Seattle, NYC, SF, etc, those cities have higher minimum wages paid to all at the minimum level. Why is it so permissible to add to a server's pocketbook when I don't tip the retail guy, or the quick lube tech? What about those guys? They have a marginally more difficult job, in a technical sense. But they live in the same high cost of living area, yet we're not such bleeding hearts about their supplemented income. What makes servers and bartenders so special?

#2) Even IF servers (using this example because it's the most common) were paid only $2.13/hr (which zero of them legally make that little), why is that the customer's problem to supplement the additional wages? We're already paying exactly what we're asked to pay. Seriously?

#3) Tip creep. We see it everywhere. Automated machines have been seen requesting tips. WTF?! What about grocery store clerks? Some of them have tip jars. Why, exactly? To pull at your heart strings, and hope you'll buy them their next cups of coffee. This is something we see all over. I'm a public school teacher. My job, believe or not, is much more involved than a server's, bartender's, or retail worker's. I get paid much more money than them, but only because it's not well published what servers make nationwide, so perhaps I don't. I'm saying this because no matter what your job is, you don't DESERVE  a tip just because you do the job. You might deserve it for being a badass and doing something worth earning a tip.

These are the beginning. I was motivated to write this to highlight why I believe tipping should be halted. Feel free to add to it. I'm just sick of people on here who don't seem to understand why this movement is a thing. 

In short, want more money? Get a better paying job or be a badass at your current job, if you're in a tipped position. Just don't expect it!",39,1746408568.0,EndTipping,49,0.81,False

In 2024, I quit vaping (vaped from 2023-2024) and immediately I was going days without having a movement. Coffee was helping when things like miralax, or metamucil werent working. Dulcolax would help, but it puts me in so much pain. Tried magnesium citrate as well.

The downside is I dont feel like Im completely emptying, and I've also been suffering from overactive bladder, which the coffee exacerbates. I upped my fiber intake, am drinking 60-70 oz of water a day, I would consider myself a very active person (Gym 3-4 times a week, 20-40 minutes of cardio). On my off days, I walk anywhere from 4k-10k steps. Went on vacation from Wednesday-Sunday, didnt shit the whole time. Ordered a small iced coffee from dunks, and had to pull over omw home to take a 10 minute shit.

I get a GI and urology referral- Urologist believes the constipation is the reason for OAB, gastro agrees. GI puts me on 16mcg of Amitiza - 1 in the morning, 1 in the evening. Doesnt work, so she ups it to 2 in the morning, 1 in night, and to up to 2 at night it if things get worse. The new dosage worked for 2 weeks, then back to nothing. I wrote a message in the portal, nothing yet. My appointment with her is on 6/3.

My GI sent over a referral to a physical therapist to see if everything is functioning normally. Externally, I have some basic tightness around my hips. She did a pelvic floor exam, and found nothing crazy, and said everything appeared to be functioning normally.

Im feeling hopeless. I wouldnt even gaf about the constipation if it wasnt for the OAB. But i am feeling so hopeless. Without coffee I can go a full week without pooping (save for the occasional deer poop here and there). The longest I've gone was 10 days and I finally got an enema to go again.

Would be really nice just to have a night out where there’s even one remotely attractive man. I never get that at home and home is v boring. I usually just travel to dance events and festivals.  
I haven’t been to NY in ages. 
Also if there is any cute cafes/coffee shops I should check out lmk. I love matcha.  
I am gonna be going out/sight seeing in Manhattan and Brooklyn.

I’d love your help brainstorming:  
- What’s a business or service you loved that’s gone now? (I might bring it back better than ever!)  
- What’s something we *don’t* have in Austin that you wish we did? (Coffee shops? Kid-friendly spots? Specialty retail?)  
- Any unmet needs you’ve noticed? What's so good you drive out of town for it?

No idea is too small or silly. I’m just beginning my research and grateful for any insights. Thanks in advance for helping me shake free of being focused on parenting and think like a business owner again!  ",0,1746407904.0,Austin,40,0.48,False

A lot context before I get into it'll everything: I 19yo female have had no contact with my mom for a little over 4 years now. I (15 @ this time) ran away from her with my older sister to live with my dads side (another city) about a year after she admitted to me that she had been SA'd by our step dad,whom my mom had been married to and with for 8 years. My sister had been in therapy for a few months after it happened and during the very first session my mom told the therapist that my sister had begged for it and that it wasn't the first time to happen either. My mom had also always been very abusive mentally/physically with me since I could remember but never with my sister, she was actually favored by my mom and step dad growing up which is why I never suspected that he would do such a thing to her, let alone my mom know about the encounters. Despite being abused by my mom I never spoke up about it and neither did my family, mentally I was just trying to hold myself together til I turned 18 so I was generally okay with my abuse so long as my sister didn't have to deal with it. But after learning about her SA I called our dad who I hadn't spoken to in years and told him everything that had been happening. (A lot more story to that but I can save for another post.) We lived with him at my grandma's house for about 6 months before she eventually moved back with my mom because my dad was not as ""financially stable"" for her to live with, of course I knew she missed getting money and just whatever she wanted in general from my mom, who is more financially comfortable, and knows she can manipulate more easily. I chose to stay with my dad because I simply wasn't interested in having a relationship with my mom anymore and was ready to get the help I needed even though she was okay with my mom knowing about her SA all along. Fast forward to now, me and my boyfriend (21yo) have been together for what will be 2 years in July, also in July are expecting a baby girl. We have always genuinely known that each other is what we want, and now with babygirl on the way are engaged and live together. We are very close with his family and my dads side, along with my great grandma from my moms side since we all live in the same city and everyone's house is about 15 minutes apart from each other. Despite being together for this long, I still have not opened up about everything my mom put me through, as I am still working with my therapist to better understand myself and how to deal with it. We were not planning on having a baby shower and planned on just making a registry/small get together at my dads house because we genuinely don't have the money for a big party. 2 months ago my mom offered through my great grandma, to host and pay for a baby shower because she is ""SO EXCITED"" to be a grandma. At first I declined because I genuinely didn't want her to feel like she could come back and in my life and play mommy again. After some talking with my fiancé he convinced me that maybe she had changed and just to look at it as good for our baby so we can celebrate with both family's together. I agreed and she ended up finding a place to which she just made the last payment for so the party is set to take place mid may. For those few months between her offer and us accepting, we had still been no contact, when last week out of nowhere she calls me off of my great grandmas phone and tells me for my fiance and I to go to her city and find a baby shower dress/heels because she ""knew I didn't have anything yet"" and if I did it was probably cheap. I immediately declined, to which my great grandma puts me down about because she had planned on going with us and took it as I didn't want to travel with her. (My great grandma is 90 years old with the early stages of dementia + wheelchair bound and it honestly broke my heart to make her feel like this) I ended up feeling like complete shit and changing my mind but told them as long as my fiance could come as well, but he only had Saturday off from work so we'd need to drive back early Sunday morning) to which my mom agreed. That Friday night she picked us up from our place first then we headed to my great grandmas house. When we got there she had no clue as to what we were talking about (she never even remembered we were going out of town) and never had her bags packed/medications together/ or someone to watch her house for her. She ended up just being completely shocked that me and my mom were in the same room together and begged me to just go and find a dress that I would enjoy getting out of town. Upset as I was I'm also very pregnant, had my bags and cat in the car and was just ready to get this over with so we headed to my moms city. We got there, showered and went to sleep as we needed to get ready early to start shopping early since we were looking for an outfit for both my fiance and I. I woke up around 8:30am, showered spent some time with my cat before waking up my fiance and to do my makeup. We were both ready by 10:30am atp my mom and sister were not awake yet. I had to go into the room they were staying in to wake them up to which they took 2 hours to get ready, which I feel they did on purpose, while they were getting ready my fiance asked my mom if it was okay if he stepped outside to smoke, she agrees and even tells him how to unlock the door (they are sliding ones and a bit confusing). Absolutely nothing in the pantry or fridge either so we did not get to eat yet. 12pm but had to drop my sister off at work but of course they stopped at Starbucks for her and my moms coffee, oh then Panera bread because they were dying for a sandwich. Again waste of time. Finally dropped my sister off at work and headed to the mall to find my dress first. We ended up passing by a very expensive store that my mom insisted I look at because in her words ""if you didn't find anything here you wont find anything at all"". It's 2pm atp and I was worried if I didn't find a dress here my fiance wouldn't have time to find an outfit since most stores close around 8pm. Found a dress there to which she INSISTED she payed for & practically smacked my fiancé's card from his hand at the register. He let her and this just seemed to tickle her so much she had the biggest smile on her face. Since we had found my dress shoes would be easy and I told her we needed to go look for my fiancé's outfit now at the mall, to which instead she drove us to a MARSHALLS. I kid you not a fucking Marshalls. I just about lost my mind and asked her what was her problem and why would we come a whole city away to come look for his outfit at a damn Marshalls. She acted completely offended and acted like it was okay and before she could even respond my fiance as sweet as he is just said we can get down and look since we'd already drove there. We spent about 2 minutes in there before he looked and seen how scattered all the clothes was and we both knew we would find nothing for him. We got back in the car and I could barely look at her to which my fiance now did the talking and asked just to go to the Polo he searched on GPS which was at the mall we intended to go to in the first place, she gets agrivated that I'm not speaking but starts driving. We get there and we ended up finding him a very nice polo that matches with my dress, it's a long line so he suggested I start to go look for shoes and he would call me after he payed to meet us. My mom and I make our way to the Macy's shoe department part of the mall and I start trying on shoes, and she just can't stop mentioning to me that she is practically starving and about how my sisters job is also where she happens to work and that we should go eat there,I agree because I really just wanted her to stfu. Found my shoes and my fiance meets up with us it's about 4pm, we head back to the house to change because she said it's ""very fancy"" and they won't let us in if we had on ""sneakers and street clothes"". It ended up being a Brazilian steakhouse, we sit down they explain to my fiance and I how it works since we'd never been before, to which my mom shoved the waiter out of the way and told him ""she can explain it better"" and sent him to get our drinks. I still haven't been talking but my fiance is a talkative person and just starts conversation telling her about himself since this is their first time meeting. Cooks going around with the different meat and everything is I kid you not RARE. We're talking blood spitting at you when they cut the meat. I had asked for medium or medium well but still everything just came rare and I quickly lost my appetite, so much wasted meat on both my fiance and i's plates and we gave up on eating the meat, but of course my mom is just eating it all up acting like it's the best thing she's ever put in her mouth. My fiance orders a few handmade drinks while I eat what I can at the salad bar. Check comes and she put it right in front of him with the same big smile she had earlier and goes on and on about how I'm so lucky to have someone to pay such a bill. The bill was $300. Not including gratuity. $300. I take the bill and tell her he won't be paying it as we would have been more than happy eating McDonald's or practically anything else. She's clearly offended that I embarrassed her like that but gets our waiter and tells them to ""add her discounts"" while she goes to the restroom. While she's gone they bring the check back and I read it, 50% for her, then since we were guest of hers 40% for my fiance and I together. The bill total after discounts was $17.50. Nowhere near what my fiance was going to pay. I'm shook at this point and put the bill down, when she comes back she pays it and we go to the car. 7pm atp and still haven't found shoes or pants for my fiance so we go back to the mall. I feel horrible because every store just seems to have the same stuff & he's clearly getting annoyed he can't find anything and we're running out of time to look. He's in the dressing room and she asked me: ""why is he so angry?"" Trying to keep my cool I explain to her we both woke up very early, hadn't eaten and we're still hungry, and was rushed into finding his outfit, not to even mention what she pulled at the restaurant. Again she acts completely clueless and offers to get us food after he's done looking because we needed to pick up my sister from work anyway. He did end up finding some nice pants to go with the polo, and gave up on looking for shoes. We head to pick my sister up and she's also hungry so we all end up placing a order for Wingstop then bring it back to the house. As we're eating my sister, fiance and I are just talking trying to catch up as I hadn't really seen/spoke to her since she moved back. The whole time she is just making jokes talking shit about her boyfriend/co workers/friends and referring to sexy redd ""fuck my baby daddy"" to which I shut down because I very much love my man and don't even listen to that music. She's offended but switches it and ask him about what he does for work, after he mentions he just recently got promoted she just blurts out: ""imagine they just fired you"". I'm thinking to myself why in the fuck would she say something like that. It goes over my fiancés head and he just keeps talking about how he's actually a good worker and his company really appreciates him. We finish eating and he tells my mom ""is it okay if I go outside to the back again?"" She agrees, ask him if he remembers how to unlock the door and I go to shower. I got undressed but forgot something so I can put my hair up so I wrap myself in a towel and go get what I needed. I'm in the hallway but I overhear my mom telling my fiance ""you know you aren't allowed to smoke around the baby right?"" He quickly replies with ""of course I do, I have nieces and nephews who I treat like my own and I know how and what to do around kids, let alone babies"" I can hear how annoyed she is that he even spoke back to her when she starts to tell him how if she catches him smoking when the baby is here it's gonna be a big problem. I come around the corner acting like I heard nothing, took the fastest shower of my life and immediately went to her room asking what the actual fuck is wrong with her. I hadn't even had a chance to tell him I overheard the conversation but she immediately says ""what did he tell you that I said"" like are you serious? I tell her as soon as we wake up she's apologizing to him and taking us back home, she starts ballisticly crying telling me sorry that she didn't mean to try to lecture him. I shut her room door and go to find my fiance because he wasn't in the room, but outside crying thinking that I would be mad that he spoke back to my mom and that he didn't mean to get in the way of us getting close again. I could not express more to him that he is my other half, who I plan to be with and I wasn't worried about her or my relationship with her at all. And that after all he is a grown man and can do whatever he wants let alone take anything she says to heart because god knows I don't. I'm so upset at myself that I even agreed to come out of town with them then for them to make him feel this way, it's his baby too and I just can't help but feel that they don't deserve to be around my baby or us.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way.

1keznm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeetNewPeopleHere/comments/1keznm5/34m_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection_and/,[34/M] - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it,"Hello!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.

1kezn21,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXIndia/comments/1kezn21/ive_got_a_little_squish_and_it_feels_wholesome_as/,I've got a little squish - and it feels wholesome as !,"Squish = platonic crush (as in I have a squish on a colleague and really want to be friends with her).

I was on here a while back, complaining about a bully colleague. Ah how the turntables! I'm here to talk about another colleague who i think i might have a squish on. She's so lovely, amazing personality, and just so funny. We have a lot in common - exchanging TV show recommendations and game suggestions. We've also talking serious things that she wants to learn more about, from little old me. 🥹

I have found it so hard to make friends as an adult immigrant. She's a little bit older, but I feel like we vibe so hard! We've talked about different things ""omg we should totally go to this store, we should definitely do a brunch, we should go dancing, etc"" but nothing has materialized. This week, I plan on materializing. 

Idk why I feel nervous, like I'm asking a guy on a date! Scratch that, I've asked guys out and it wasn't this much pressure. The stakes are higher because guys come and go, and a strong female friendship has potential for forever. 🥰

I've been talking about her a lot at home, and I don't think most people in my life understand how exciting it is for me to find a friend that I vibe with, actually look forward to making plans. Just feel like this community would get me 🥰

I do have other friends, but a lot of the time it's just us catching up over coffee and vent about their bad relationships - and it makes me emotionally drained at the end of the meet up. Wish me luck as I ask her to take our workplace acquaintance to an after-work hang. ",8,1746407716.0,TwoXIndia,3,0.79,False

1kezm25,https://i.redd.it/ce0vbuci6vye1.jpeg,Glitch El Diviso & Risaralda,"I used the Pulsar for both of these: 20g:340g, 93°C.

The Risaralda is my favorite of the two. I've found that my love of butter crosses over into coffee too. This one is super smooth, rich buttery taste with a bright vanilla peach. I love it. Every time I brewed this one it came out great. The flavor to me starts with a savory peach and finishes with buttery aftertaste. 

The El Diviso starts with chocolate up front and a pomegranate sweetness that sits on the back of your tongue after each sip. I didn't get much mango until it cooled down a bit and then the flavors really popped. It was almost kinda night and day between hot flavor and cooler flavor.

I'd love to try these both again next time there's a Glitch drop.",4,1746407630.0,coffeerotation,0,1.0,False
1kezlts,https://www.reddit.com/r/lookingforfriendship/comments/1kezlts/34m_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection_and/,[34/M] - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it,"Hello!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please.** I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. Major bonus points for people who know themselves and what they seek and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* On that, **being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** We're in a digital realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, is unlikely to go further than a brief encounter. The physical is a later goal of what we create together here without needing it.

GPT:  Imagine leaving behind a legacy of mysterious and whimsical automations that make your home feel like a treasure-filled puzzle for those who live there after you. Here are some fun and unexpected ideas to expand on your concept:

1. **Holiday Hijinks**  
   - **July 4th**: Left light bulb turns blue, right light bulb red, and a speaker plays a short burst of fireworks sounds at random times.  
   - **Halloween**: Dim the lights and have eerie whispers play faintly over the speakers when someone walks into a room.  
   - **Christmas**: Automatically play a random Christmas song when the fridge door is opened.

2. **Random Encouragement**  
   - Once a week, a hidden speaker could announce in a calming voice: ""You're doing great. Keep going."" (But never the same day or time.)  

3. **Treasure Hunts**  
   - On specific dates, lights could blink in a Morse code pattern that leads to a hidden message or clue about your life, like a secret safe or a favorite recipe.  

4. **Personalized Mischief**  
   - If someone says, ""I'm bored,"" the house could respond with: ""Really? Perhaps you should clean the attic.""  
   - If someone complains about the weather, a random fact about storms could appear on any smart screen in the house.

5. **Surprise Rituals**  
   - On your birthday, the house could turn all the lights to your favorite color and softly play your favorite song.  
   - The coffee maker could brew automatically on the anniversary of your first cup of coffee.

6. **Phantom Presence**  
   - Occasionally, a light in an unused room could turn on for a few minutes, as if you’re still walking around.

If you want to get really creative, you could program these automations to only trigger under specific conditions, like certain phrases, dates, or even moon phases. It would make your home feel alive and keep people guessing—turning you into a legend long after you're gone!",1,1746407566.0,GPT,0,1.0,False

Context: Last night, nagdinner kami sa labas sa tabi2 lang ng condo. Nung pauwi na kami, nakapag decide kami na bread nalang yung kainin namin for breakfast kaya bumili kami ng dalawang malaking bread para tig isa2 kami. Sobrang laki talaga ng isang bread okay nadin yon pang partner sa coffee. Kinabukasan, nagising nalang ako na tapos na syang mag breakfast kasi mas maaga pasok nya sa work. Sabi nya saakin inubos nya na yung dalawang malaking bread since nasarapan daw sya at bumili nalang daw ako para sa sarili ko. Umaga palang pero grabeh yung disappointment ko. I told him that he’s selfish at sya ang bumili ulit sa baba para may ma braakfast ako. Bumili naman sya kasi napagsabihan ko pero pagbalik ko, it’s not the same bread 🥲 Maliit na violet yung binili.

Previous Attempts: May mga small fights nadin kami dati kasi may times na sarili nya lang iniisip nya.
