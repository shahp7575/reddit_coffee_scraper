1ix2sui,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtGCSE/comments/1ix2sui/what_i_learnt_as_someone_who_did_art_gcse/,what i learnt as someone who did art gcse,"for context, i studied 2021-23, if i get the offer needed, i will be going to uni studying fine art, they looked through one of my gcse sketchbooks and was impressed . i got a 6 in gcse, but according to my tutor that was based on the AMOUNT of work i did

1) backgrounds of research and experimentation aint gotta look pretty 

at the start of the course we got told to make them look pretty, half way through when we were all behind after spending more time on presentation than our work, we got informed that little (maybe even 0) marks come from that

personally i would keep cool backgrounds for your artist research as it helps set the tone of the artist

2) practice aside from your coursework

you get marks based on the quality of your work, so do as much as you can to increase the quality of your work. studying form and figure would be best, but it depends on your individual skillset.

i find doing this separate to what i am working on is best as it feels more relaxing

 3) it doesnt matter if you know you will just paint, test every substance out there

for each piece test anything you can think of, pastels, oil pastels, coffee, literally anything, try it all

4) DO AS MUCH WORK AS YOU PHYSICALLY CAN

now coming from experience (i did 11 gcses which did not help) the main downfall of grades primarily comes from not doing enough work, so do 5 practice pieces, changing things each time, create 5 compositions even if they suggest 2 etc etc

4.5) if you do not fill your sketchbook for a project, it probably isnt enough work

5) you are allowed to make a drawing a photocopy it to test different materials on it

i wish i knew this before my last project as someone who takes the most time resketching my design



GENERAL ART TIPS (not gcse specific)

1ix2rt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/huntingblinds/comments/1ix2rt8/some_quick_tips_on_hunting_blinds/,Some quick tips on hunting blinds,"Hey r/huntingblinds, how’s it going? I’m new around here, but I’ve been working with hunting blinds for what feels like ages. I own a sporting goods store, [OutdoorsForLess.com](https://www.outdoorsforless.com) (been around since 1998), but I’m not here to sell you anything—just to swap stories and share tips I’ve learned in the field (and the workshop).

# Buy vs. Build: The Eternal Question

Let’s start with the big debate: should you buy a blind or build one yourself?

* If you’ve got the carpentry skills (or at least the willpower) and some spare weekends, building can be mighty rewarding. You’ll get to brag about how you hammered every nail, even the ones you bent.
* On the flip side, there are so many solid pre-fab blinds these days that by the time you add up wood, hardware, windows, and about five runs to the hardware store because you forgot something, you might be better off buying. Not to mention, you’ll still have time left to actually hunt instead of chasing runaway lumber in your truck bed.

# Size Matters (and Then Some)

I always say, go bigger than you think you need. A 6’x6’ might sound like overkill, but believe me, once you’ve got a buddy in there, plus gear, snacks, and enough coffee to keep you warm on a frosty morning, you’ll be glad you didn’t cram yourself into a phone booth. And hey, if you’re a bowhunter like me, you need the extra elbow room to draw without knocking your quiver into the wall.

# Windows & Concealment

Good windows are worth every penny. I’m not affiliated with them, but DeerView Windows are a popular choice for a reason. They don’t rattle around and spook game—or your neighbor’s cat (don’t ask). For concealment, a simple curtain or shade on each window can keep you from looking like a glowing stick figure against a bright morning sky. No fancy tint required—just something to block backlight so the deer don’t see your silhouette waving at ‘em.

# Creature Comforts (Because We’re Human)

Let’s talk about making your blind feel like home—because sometimes it is home for a few weeks of the year, if you’re really hardcore.

1. Flooring: A little carpeting or foam padding muffles sound (no more sounding like a bull moose stomping around) and is easy to yank out and shake off when it gets filthy.
2. Heating: If you’re in a cold climate, a propane “buddy” heater is an easy fix, but I’ve seen folks get fancy with tiny wood stoves. Dry heat means no fogged windows—just be sure you’re venting properly so you don’t become a cautionary tale.
3. Platform: If your blind is elevated, slap a small platform on the outside. Your ankles, your gear, and your dignity will thank you when you don’t have to do acrobatics to climb inside.

And for those of us who’ve had that coffee come back to haunt us at the worst possible time, consider a little funnel or hose setup—trust me, it can save your hunt and your pride.

# Insulation: To Do or Not to Do?

I get asked about insulation a lot. If you’re running a heater, you’ll probably be fine without it—especially if you’re just out for a morning sit. But if you’re planning marathon sessions in sub-zero conditions (and you like the feeling in your toes), a bit of insulation can keep you in the game longer. Sometimes it’s the difference between punching that tag or heading home early for a hot shower.

# Little Extras That Go a Long Way

* Hooks & Shelves: A few well-placed hooks or small shelves can keep your pack, thermos, and calls organized. Nobody wants to rummage around in the dark, knocking stuff over when a big buck walks out.
* Comfy Seat: Invest in a decent chair or cushion. I’ve spent more time napping in my blind than I care to admit, but sometimes that midday snooze is the best part of the day.
* Lights: A small red or green LED can help you see your gear without spooking game. Just don’t go disco-ball bright in there—it’s a hunting blind, not a concert venue.

# Share Your Stories!

Anyway, that’s my two cents. I’ve spent enough time in blinds to know what works (and what’ll make you wish you’d stayed in bed). If you’ve got any funny build mishaps, must-have add-ons, or insider tricks to share, I’m all ears. I love hearing how other hunters tweak their setups—there’s always something new to learn.

Thanks for reading, y’all. Good luck out there, and stay safe. Hope you bag that dream buck (or at least have a good story to tell around the campfire)!

(Again, I’m just here to talk blinds, not to pitch my store. If you have any questions, fire away, and I’ll do my best to help.)

1ix2gz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1ix2gz8/february_trip_florence_milan_sienna/,"February Trip - Florence, Milan, Sienna","Spent a week in Florence 2/15 - 2/21/25 and made day trips to Milan and Sienna. This was our second time going to Florence. Our first time was during a cruise so we were constrained on timing. This time was more relaxed and chill. Average tempratures was 43 degrees fahrenheit, so bring a warm jacket if you're visting around this time. There was still some crowds around this time of the year, but not as much as there would be like in Highlights

\- Train to Milan from Florence took roughly 2 hours. We bought tickets for the city sightseeing bus which took us right in front of the Duomo. It was a Sunday so I believe there was a service taking place. We climbed the steps to the rooftop terrance for a nice view of the city. Coming back we did take the city sightseeing bus back to the train station, which also allowed us to see more of the city center in a short amount of time. 

\- On our last day, we took the bus to Sienna which took around 1 hour 15 mins. We bought tickets at the bus terminal next to the train station, and the bus stop in Sienna was a short walking distance to the city center. We didn't know much about Sienna before coming here, so we were very suprised on how much we enoyed our visit. Out of the three Duomos we've seen on this trip, the Sienna Duomo was my favorite! Absolutely stunning. We climbed to the top of the musuem for a beautiful view of the city. 

\- Even though there were less crowds this time of year, there was were a lot of groups around, and we missed out on the time we wanted for the Florence Duomo. We had already seen the inside on our first trip two years prior, but wanted to climb the Duomo this round. Oh well!

\- In Florence we stayed at the Residenza Castiglioni. It was a 5 minute from the Duomo. Rooms were spacious and clean, and we liked how central this B&B was to everywhere we wanted to go. It was also nice getting a quick breakfast here when we didn't feel like eating out for breakfast. My bag was delayed at the airport, and the front desk was very helpful in getting us into our room afterhours. 

\- We did a few classes and tastings during our visit. We did a pasta and tiramisu class through Viator. So much fun, we made two types of pasta and tiramisu, and afterwards we ate the pasta and tiramisu we made. Honestly the best tiramisu I ate on the trip. The cooking instructor was great and made the experience enjoyable. We did a perfume making class on a different day through Viator, where we sampled scents to create our own perfumes. It took place in a beautiful perfumery and I love the perfume I ended up with. They're also able to recreate your perfume and ship it to you should you run out. Our last class was an olive oil tasting where we sampled different type sof olive oils. This was a last minute decision to fill in some exta time in our schedule, and I'm glad we did. This was a unquie experience and I learned a lot of about the different tasting profiles and intensity levels of olive oils.

\- The main reason we went back to Florence: we got tattoos done! We took two buses to Belly Button Tattoo Studio which was located near the airport. I got an olive branch tattoo done while my friend got an origami-styled pokemon piece. Our tattoo artists were amazing, and their studio was great. We loved the pieces that we got done!

\- Giunti Odeon in Florence is a bookstore and cinema with seating upstairs. It's a great place to relax and watch a movie if you want a break from walking. They were showing Charlie Chapin movies the morning we went.

\- If you have a pet, there's a woman by the Uffizi Gallery who paints watercolor pet potraits for 25 euros. She did an amazing painting of my friend's dog! 

For resturants and food, we just went to whatever was closest to us on google maps. For lunch, we mostly ate quick meals like sandwiches or anything that didn't require a full sit down service. Same with gelato and coffee. For dinner, we just went to whatever was near us on google maps. It was just two of us, so we didn't make any reservations aside from one resturants (even then I think we didn't have to make reservation but we did so to be safe). We also ate early around 6pm which help beat the crowds. We did eat at Trattoria Za Za, which is popular on TikTok/social media. While we did enjoy the food, it was our least favorite out of all our meals on our trip. I also cannot emphasize enough how awful their bread was. The meals themselves were fine, but the bread before the meals was just awful.

The one resturant we made a reservation for was at Gun\\u00e9. We did their 8 course Beginning, Development, and Conclusion. They included a few dishes outside of their tasting menu, including about 7 types of bread. Despite how small each course was, I was honestly so full from the food that I couldn't finish the final desserts. Each course was great, and the service was very attentive.

I do reccommend to make an attempt in saying a few Italian phrases. Aside from our tattoo studio, every place we went to spoke English, so communication won't be a problem, but it makes a difference when you try to speak a little Italian.

Overall, we had such a great time on our short trip! Florence was one of the highlights on our cruise two years ago, and I was really excited to visit again and really take our time to explore. Can't wait to come back!",2,1740405037.0,ItalyTravel,4,1.0,False

1ix2g3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ExtensionJaguar7511/comments/1ix2g3v/the_hearth_of_home/,The Hearth of Home,"London lay cloaked in a thick predawn mist, the air damp and heavy with the scent of rain-soaked cobblestones. The dim glow of gas lamps flickered uncertainly along the empty streets, their feeble light barely penetrating the swirling fog. Hoofbeats echoed hollowly against the quiet facades of townhouses, and the creak of carriage wheels over the slick pavement was the only other sound breaking the silence of the sleeping city.

Inside the carriage, Edmund Blake sat hunched in contemplation, his tall frame wrapped in a well-worn traveler’s cloak. The fabric smelled faintly of tobacco and old leather, carrying with it the essence of many long, thoughtful nights spent beside his hearth. His gloved hands rested upon his knee, fingers idly tracing the embroidery on his coat—a habit born of anxious anticipation.

A man of respectable years, Edmund was neither young nor frail; his hair had begun to silver at the temples, yet his posture remained strong, his eyes still keen with an insatiable curiosity. It was that very hunger for adventure, nurtured since youth, that had driven him to this moment. For decades, he had dreamed of standing before the pyramids of Egypt, of wandering the bustling bazaars of India, of losing himself in the labyrinthine streets of Venice and Rome. He had read of these places in books, traced their outlines upon maps, and listened with envy to the stories of travelers who had seen the world with their own eyes.

Now, at last, he had decided: he, too, would see these wonders. The fire of longing burned too fiercely in his chest to be ignored any longer.

Edmund leaned slightly forward, peering through the carriage window as the horses pulled him farther away from Baker Street. His home—a modest, sturdy house with ivy creeping along its stone walls—stood quiet in the mist, its familiar outline softened by the fog. Behind those windows lay a life of routine, of comfort, of evenings by the fire with a book in hand. It was a life many would envy, yet tonight, to him, it felt like a gilded cage.

""If not now, then when?"" he murmured under his breath, his voice barely audible above the rhythmic clatter of the wheels.

With one last lingering glance, he turned away from the sight of his home, watching instead as the city blurred into the distance. London was behind him now, and the world lay ahead.

Edmund’s journey stretched across months, then years, each passing landscape adding another layer to the tapestry of his adventure. He had wandered through lands he had once only dreamed of, stepping into the pages of history and legend.

He had stood beneath the towering pyramids of Egypt, their ancient stones whispering secrets of forgotten ages. The desert sun burned fiercely above him, casting long, shifting shadows over the golden sands, and as he ran his hand along the timeworn limestone, he felt the weight of millennia press upon his soul. The grandeur of the place was undeniable, yet as he stood there, surrounded by travelers and merchants speaking in unfamiliar tongues, a strange sense of loneliness coiled in the pit of his stomach.

In Venice, he drifted through the silent canals in a gondola, watching candlelit reflections dance upon the water. The air was thick with the scent of damp stone and sea brine, and music from a distant violinist curled through the narrow alleyways. He should have felt enchanted—after all, wasn’t this what he had longed for? But as he sat in the gently rocking boat, he caught himself yearning not for the romance of the moment, but for the creaking of his own wooden floorboards at home, the warmth of a familiar hearth.

Istanbul greeted him with the call to prayer at dusk, the voice of the muezzin soaring over the city’s domes and minarets. He watched as the sky deepened into a velvet indigo, the Bosphorus shimmering in the last golden light of day. The scent of spiced coffee and roasting chestnuts lingered in the air, mingling with the smoke of a hundred chimneys. It was magnificent—everything he had imagined. Yet, as he sat alone at a café, the cup warm between his fingers, he could not shake the thought that there was no one across from him to share in the wonder.

He sipped coffee on the narrow streets of Paris, watching couples stroll arm in arm beneath the flickering glow of street lamps, their laughter carrying through the crisp evening air. He inhaled the scorching desert winds of the Arabian Peninsula, the dry heat clinging to his skin as he rode across the dunes under a sky so vast it seemed to swallow him whole. He lost himself in the labyrinthine markets of Marrakech, where merchants beckoned him with colorful silks and the scent of cinnamon and saffron.

It seemed that at last, his soul had been nourished by the wonders it had craved since youth. He had seen the world. He had stood where emperors and poets had once stood, where civilizations had risen and fallen.

And yet, the longer he traveled, the more an inexplicable emptiness gnawed at him.

In Rome, he sat by the Trevi Fountain, watching as visitors tossed coins into the rippling water, their faces alight with hope for return. He had always believed that travel would bring him fulfillment, yet in that moment, he realized he no longer yearned for more distant lands. Instead, he longed for the worn cushion of his armchair, for the quiet creak of his study door, for the rhythmic ticking of the old clock on the mantle.

In Alexandria, he stood upon the harbor and gazed at the endless, shifting sea, its waves stretching toward horizons unseen. The salty breeze tousled his hair, and he closed his eyes, listening to the call of the gulls. It was beautiful. It was vast. But it was not home.

No one waited for his return at the door. No one would warm his tea or welcome him with a knowing smile.

In all his search for marvels, he had overlooked the greatest wonder of all—the simple, irreplaceable comfort of home.

One morning, as the first pale light of dawn crept through the heavy curtains of his hotel room in Athens, Edmund awoke with an unfamiliar stillness in his heart. For months—no, for years—he had woken with anticipation, eager to set foot in a new city, to drink in its sights and sounds, to lose himself in its streets. But today, he felt none of that.

He lay in bed for a long time, staring at the ceiling, listening to the muffled sounds of the world outside—vendors calling to early customers, the distant clatter of hooves on cobblestones, the murmur of voices speaking in a tongue that was not his own. The room around him was filled with relics of his journey: maps worn at the edges, books purchased in forgotten markets, a travel case scuffed from years of motion. He had seen the world, traced the paths of kings and scholars, wandered lands he had once only read about.

And yet—there was nowhere left to go.

For the first time in his life, he did not hunger for another destination. He did not long for another port or another city square. He longed only for the familiar—the creak of a wooden step beneath his foot, the scent of rain-soaked London streets, the quiet solitude of his study, where books lined the shelves like old friends waiting patiently for his return.

He knew then, without doubt or hesitation, that his journey was over.

The carriage wheels rumbled softly as they crossed the bridge into London. The city was much as he had left it—somber and gray, wrapped in its eternal mist, the lamps glowing faintly through the fog. But now, it felt different. It was no longer a place to escape from, no longer a place of confinement. It was a place that called him back, a place that had been waiting for him all along.

As the horses slowed, the familiar shape of his home emerged from the fog. It looked smaller than he remembered, humbler somehow, yet never had it seemed so welcoming. The ivy still clung to the bricks, the iron railing still bore traces of rust where his hand had so often rested. It was the same house he had left behind, but to his weary soul, it felt transformed.

Stepping down from the carriage, he climbed the steps slowly, almost reverently, pausing before the door. His fingers trembled slightly as he reached into his coat and pulled out the key. It was worn smooth from years of use, its weight familiar in his palm. He hesitated, his breath catching for just a moment, as if fearing that beyond this door, time had erased all that he had once known.

The key turned in the lock. The door creaked open.

Inside, the air was still and cool. The fireplace was dark, the embers long since turned to dust. A thin layer of dust had settled over the furniture, the shelves, the framed pictures on the walls. It was as though the house had been waiting in silence, holding its breath for his return.

He stepped inside and closed the door behind him.

The moment he set his travel-worn trunk against the wall, a warmth spread through him—not from the cold room, but from something deeper, something unshaken by time or distance.

*""How good it is to be home,""* he whispered, the words barely more than a breath, as he crossed the room and sank into his old chair by the fireplace.

It fit him as perfectly as it always had.

And in that instant, he understood: **the greatest journey in life is the road back home.**",1,1740404965.0,u_ExtensionJaguar7511,0,1.0,False
1ix2fpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_the-lab1618/comments/1ix2fpl/how_to_organize_your_thoughts/,How to Organize Your Thoughts,"The key to clarity is[ intentional organization](https://jameelaghann.squarespace.com/productivity-lab). 

Here’s how to organize your thoughts so you can get back to feeling like the boss you are.

# Write It Down to Get Thoughts Out of Your Head

# Why this works

Writing your thoughts down clears mental clutter. It’s like decluttering your mind Marie Kondo style!

Start with a [journal or a digital app like Sunsama](https://try.sunsama.com/productivity-lab) or Evernote. Jot down everything on your mind—lists, sentences, random phrases, or even doodles. The idea is to empty your brain without worrying about perfection.

[Read More: Best Digital Planners](https://jameelaghann.squarespace.com/productivity-lab/digital-productivity-planners-that-will-help-you-get-sht-done)

Pro tip

Use bullet journaling to keep it all neat. You can create sections for work ideas, personal to-dos, or even long-term dreams. If you prefer typing, apps like Notion are great for organizing scattered thoughts into folders and databases.

Want a step-by-step?

1. Set a timer for 10 minutes.
2. Write down everything—yes, even the random thought about needing more coffee filters.
3. Sort your notes into categories like “urgent,” “nice to remember,” and “future goals.”

# Create a Mind Map for Big Ideas

# What’s a mind map? 

Think of it as brainstorming, but prettier. Start with a central idea (e.g., “business goals”) and branch out with related topics. Apps like [MindMeister](https://www.mindmeister.com) make it easy.

# How to make one

1. Write your central idea in the middle of the page.
2. Branch out with related categories (e.g., “marketing,” “finance”).
3. Add smaller branches for subtopics like “social media strategy” under “marketing.”

This visual approach helps you see the big picture while breaking down overwhelming ideas into manageable chunks.

# Prioritize & Focus on What Matters Most

Your brain wants to do everything, but not all thoughts are created equal. That’s where prioritizing comes in.

# The Eisenhower Matrix Hack

Divide your tasks into these categories:

* Urgent and important: Do it now.
* Important, not urgent: Schedule it.
* Urgent, not important: Delegate it.
* Neither: Delete it (yep, let it go).

Apps to try: Opper that lets you categorize tasks by priority.

P.S. You can’t do it all at once. Learn to let go of low-priority items guilt-free.

# Take Breaks to Recharge

Ever notice how ideas magically click when you’re showering or walking? Breaks give your brain the space to process.

# Science backs it up

Studies show[ breaks can boost creativity and problem-solving](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9432722/). Try the Pomodoro Technique for [deep work](https://jameelaghann.squarespace.com/productivity-lab/the-deep-work-system-for-high-productivity). That’s when you work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break.

# Ideas for quick breaks

* Walk around the block
* Draw or color
* Use a meditation app.
* Stretch or try a 5-minute yoga flow on YouTube
* Take a 15- to 20-minute power nap 
* Take a shower 
* Allow yourself to daydream  
* Tidy up / organize your workspace
* Listen to music

# Develop a Routine for Consistency

A consistent routine trains your brain to focus. 

Start your day with a thought-organizing habit—maybe journaling or reviewing yesterday’s wins.

# Morning checklist

1. Review your to-do list
2. Prioritize tasks for the day
3. Block off time for deep work

# Reflect & Give Your Thoughts Space to Grow

Set aside time each week to reflect on what’s working and what’s not. Use prompts like:

* What’s one thing I accomplished this week that I’m proud of?
* What’s one thing I want to improve?

# Takeaway

Organized thoughts = organized actions. Start small, stay consistent, and watch your productivity soar!",1,1740404933.0,u_the-lab1618,0,1.0,False
1ix2fg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/debtfree/comments/1ix2fg7/habits_that_snowball/,Habits that Snowball,"When I was on my journey to becoming debt free, and even now after the debt, what I found that made the biggest difference was practicing money habits that snowball. The way I see it, getting ahead or falling behind is not a linear movement, its exponential. Lets say you take on $100 of debt to buy something you dont need and pay the minimums on your CCs. Then that item didnt cost $100, it cost $100 + the interest + the interest accrued on other loans that you couldve avoided had you put the $100 towards them and not more debt + the money lost had you been able to invest the $100 instead of spend it. Having money can work the same way if you are responsible and don't fall for lifestyle inflation. The more you have, the more you can invest, the more you can earn and the more you can save. There is a cost of being poor. Videos like this: [https://youtu.be/aLwRZibUqL0?si=jOKazHbMycww7U1F](https://youtu.be/aLwRZibUqL0?si=jOKazHbMycww7U1F) outline how being poor costs people more money. Having more money saves you more money so there is exponential push in both directions.

  
The more debt you have the more exponentially harder it is to get out and the longer it takes. Your life is finite and the reality is some people will not be able to accomplish their dreams because they will run out of time to do so. All that being said small habits like making your coffee at home snowball into so much more. For the last decade I have made coffee at home. The reason I think that is significant is because it doesn't end at one habit. You start practicing small financial habits and they snowball into other habits like packing lunch at home, never paying minimums, paying down debt asap, reducing bills by negotiating with reps, using rewards CCs intelligently or cutting things out that are not needed and living that way for a long time while giving all that saved money time to grow. 

When you start a journey of self improvement at the gym, someone might tell you, you have to fall in love with the lifestyle or you wont be consistent. Its the same mindset with money habits. You don't do it until a certain milestone, you let these habits compound throughout your life. For those of you who are chasing a milestone of seeing a 0 balance on your accounts I'd argue developing these habits are far more important than a milestone because without these habits you'll end up in the same place after the quick high. I'm not saying you should never spend money on fun and things you enjoy. All the sacrifice isn't worth it if we can't be happy. What I'm saying is that becoming financially secure or even just getting out of debt requires having a healthy relationship with money. Thats my 2 cents, I wish everyone luck on their journeys.",1,1740404911.0,debtfree,0,1.0,False

I'm a 38 year old male looking to get myself back down in weight and health all around before I turn 40. I just turned 38 in February so I have 2 years to accomplish this. 

I have tried dieting, working out (low impact), and am not seeing the signs. Which makes tons of things go through my head. ""Am I still eating too much?"" ""Am I not working out hard enough?"" Etc. I have an office job so I am sitting a lot, but I at least have reminders set where I am getting up and walking around for 5-10 minutes so I am not sitting 100% of the time.

Here's what I am looking for:

1. Ideas on what to eat. My problem has always been portion control, but I have eaten the most fruit and veggies and lean protein I ever have in my life and my weight just stays where it is. I've tried intermittent fasting, 2-3 meals a day, and 4-5 meals a day, all with little or no weight loss. What are some ideas for meals that I can do? Sometimes for breakfast I will just have a yogurt, lunch a salad, dinner depends, but we have a meal plan so the portions are not outrageous. I drink water and unsweetened tea all day, 1-2 coffees (no sugary add-ins) a day, and the occasional one can of diet soda. I still have my gut! My last doctor appointment said I am not pre-diabetic, which I was happy to see, and my cholesterol was a little high, so I have taken some steps to minimize that, but I want the weight off too.

2. Instead of spending money for a trainer what is some low impact (at least until I get in more shape) to get me going at the gym. I go to the gym and do a little bit of cardio and some weights, but at the end of the day I feel like I have no plan on what to do that day. Is there a video, site, that shows good workout routines for someone like me where I do not have to pay money for a video or a trainer? 

I used to rock the gym all the time when I was 18, but that was 20 years ago. I have forgotten a lot of things and there has to be something to get me going. I'm 315 pounds, 6' 1"", and I have a goal weight of 260 pounds.

Sorry so long, but I'm just tired of failing at it.

1ix28ro,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1ix28ro/you_dont_have_adhd_because_youre_organized/,"""You don't have ADHD because you're organized""","I just earlier finished a diagnostic assessment with a psychiatrist that's supposedly specialized in ADHD (not women's ADHD specifically) that I waited for for a whole year. No questions asked about masking, not a single one. Nothing about daydreaming and fantasy either other than one question on the self assessment.

The focus tests that were done were all over the place. In the first one I was average, second one I was way below average and in the third I had mixed results. Cool, makes sense since I compensate quite a bit for certain traits by being anxious lol.

While explaining to me at the end why I don't have ADHD this woman said, I kid you not ""You have no issues with being organized and you managed to get your high school diploma as an adult through self-study, most people with ADHD cannot do that."" HUH? Almost all people I know that got their diploma this way are ND and all of them keep their stuff organized too! She also mentioned I wasn't showing intense enough outward-symptoms in childhood based on the assessment...uuuh, yeah, it's almost like girls learn that they live under patriarchy and internalize their symptoms to not get punished????? I spent a ton of time in my head and in fantasy as a kid and I was super emotionally sensitive and whatnot, also easily angered at certain ages. Like, there are certainly signs I mentioned, they just never got horrible enough for teachers to intervene and clearly point towards sensory issues. I loved learning, so obviously there wouldn't have been too many signs at school. She asked nothing along the lines of hyperfocus (very present in my childhood) and didn't see that in my description of my studying being something I do in phases (phases of hyperfocus). Did I mention the pre-appointment assessments didn't include any paperwork that I could biographically fill out and only scales to check of asking about certain traits? Yeah. Almost like someone describing themselves might be relevant for diagnosis.

She ended the appointment with ""you're definitely neurodivergent but I see more signs of Aspergers in you but cannot diagnose you with that as I don't test for that."" Okay...so...not only does that specific diagnosis not exist anymore, but isn't it the statistic that 40% of people with Autism have ADHD and that they hide each other with explains every single one of my milder-presenting ADHD traits in childhood???

For context: I have almost exclusively neurodivergent friends and every single person I know that has diagnosed ADHD says I almost certainly have it. I'm peer-reviewed. The most in-depth available self test in my language says I have perfectly clinical level ADHD results, I relate to every ADHD struggle other women mention and most ADHD tricks work on me. I get tired from coffee, I have a history of unexplained anxiety, I'm horrendous at task initiation and switch tasks a lot. I stim. I interrupt people when excited. I'm easily irritated. Executive Dysfunction is a buddy of mine.

It's almost like the bit of suspected tism is what makes the frantically shaking braincells a bit more orderly.

Today was probably the worst.
Not one to play prop Hunt most days I decided today I wanted to try it. So I loaded and I sat and sat and sat. After 10 minutes I quit out and went to grab coffee. 
A few minutes after that I tried again and 20 minutes in I was still waiting. 
I've given up and moved on to other matches but they still have quite a long load time.

 For me a load time of anything more than a minute or two to find a match seems excessive.... I can wait. And I know things take time to load..... But I am not going to use any of my bonuses that are time sensitive until this problem is fixed.

1ix256o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ix256o/any_tips_for_sleeping_also_do_i_have_insomia_or/,"Any tips for sleeping? Also do I have insomia, or something else?","I have tried melatonin, and it doesnt work. I literally took 70mg melatonin last night, and I fell asleep for a couple of hours just to wake up, and then not be able to go back to sleep. (I ended up staying up to 6-7 AM last night, and waking up at 1:30 PM) Melatonin worked for like 3 days, and then it stopped no matter how much I added to my dose. 


I find myself staying up till 5-6 AM, and waking up extremely late. I am simply just not tired. It doesn't even matter if I nap or not in the day. It doesn't help I have severe anxiety that has honestly been getting worse. A few nights ago I spent 7 hours in a state of panic because I was scared my mom or cat would be dead when I woke up. I always fall into an uncomfortable and uneasy sleep, and most of my dreams are unpleasant. It's not like debilitating nightmares, and I usually don't wake up crying or panicked. But it's just unsettling dreams that fill my with dread and anxiety. 


I wish I could go to bed at 12-1 AM, and wake up around 10-11. 


It certainly doesn't help that I go to night classes. My GED classes are Monday to Thursday, qnd they start at 6:40, and end at 8:40. And the drive is a long way, so sometimes I have to take a nap if I want to safely drive to school. (One time I didnt, and I honest to God started to fall asleep on the road. It was very scary.)




Here is some reasons why I think it might not be insomia 

Admittely, I do not try very hard to fix my scedule. I am severly addicted to my phone, and I get really bad anxiety when I'm away from it. I jusy simply can't be left alone with my thoughts, and reading fanfic, doom scrolling, and listening to music makes me feel better. I spent an average of 80-100 hrs on my phone a week.  A lot of that time is not spent on it, but using it as background noise. (Although I am on it a lot) as I like to zone out, listening to music, and imagining the same/similar scene in my head. I've tried limiting it to 5 hrs a day, but I find myself bored and extremelt anxious. So limiting screen time before bed doesn't work for me. 


I also spend most days in my bed, unless I'm going to the store or school. Sometimes I get up and sit on my desk, but usually it's in my bed. The chair by my desk is kinda uncomfortable to sit on tbh. I don't really have much else to do. I could play with my dog, clean my room, brush my teeth. And sometimes I do, and I feel good after. But when I am just sitting there the very thought of doing anything outside of taking showers feel like hell. I've been skipping a bit of school because of that recently. So I know that doesn't help, but I also don't really have much else to do. Sure I can migrate downstairs, talk to the family, but they can make me feel bad. And uncomfortable. And I cant really stare at a wall and imagine scenes in my head as effectively. 


I sometimes drink caffeine, and I know that's basically confirmation that I won't sleep that day. But sometimes I say ""fuck it"" I probably won't sleep anyway. I mean, at this moment it's 5:22 AM, and I haven't even drink caffeine. But I don't drink caffeine very often. Like once or twice a week, if that. (My form of caffeine is energy drinks. I hate coffee. I don't drink energy drinks for the caffeine, but the taste. Except in rare situations where I *need* to be awake)


Also, when I do sleep, I usually stay asleep. I am a pretty light sleeper and wake up easily, but depending on what it is, I can go back to sleep. Like if my dog wants to leave my room, I can open it and go back to sleep fine. But if I have to use the restroom, I won't be able to go back to sleep. Does that make sense? For short acts, I can go back to sleep. But for slightly longer activities like taking, using the restroom, or moving to the next room, I can't go back to sleep


So yeah. This could just be me being lazy. 




I'm just tired of not being tired. Sometimes I put the phone down, try and force it, but thay hardly works. 9/10 fall into a restless sleep, wake up, unable to go to sleep again. And it's a whole ordeal, and my eyes are all grainy and hurt from forcing them closed. And if I just lay there, I get paranoid. Like there's demons in my room or something. Like I'm being watched. So yeah. Obviously this isn't true. I've tried counting to 30 and do it in groups of 10. So like count to ten, then count to five, then count to twenty, then count to then, and then count to thirty, and I restart the process. That doesn't really work, and I just bored. 



So, yeah. I'm kinda at a loss as to what to do. I have a hard time setting up routines, and yet, my body refuses to feel tired. And sometimes, it does, but I'm too anxiety ridden about nothing to sleep. (Which was a rare occurance, but has becoming more and more common recently) 


So, any advice? I know I already asked, but idk. Who knows. I've tried melatonin, cutting our caffeine, forcing myself to sleep, counting. The only things I've really not tried it limiting screen time, and having a busy day. (Second reason is because I literally have nothing else to do all day. And sometimes I just get demotivated to do the things I can do) Do I even have a problem? Or is this just like a self-inflicted issue that I gave myself, and with an ounce of self control, I can get rid of it??",1,1740404069.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1ix22h4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ix22h4/money_really_cant_buy_happiness/,Money Really Cant Buy Happiness.,"I’ve always been a working man. Since middle school, I’ve worked at least a side job after school and on the weekends. When I got out of high school I went to work full time at a factory. Most people loathe manual labor but not me. There is a certain peace in working hard jobs for me. And I’ll just come out and say I'm greedy. I like money. I love it even. Money opens doors and minds. Everyone needs money. With money, you can buy whatever you don’t have. Even friends. Even partners. The saying money can’t buy happiness holds no meaning to me. Or at least it didn’t until last week. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. 

My name is Gabe and I’m 20. Growing up poor and never being able to afford what I wanted from life I started working to buy things. Toys when I was in elementary school. TVs and movies in middle school. Cars and dates with girls in high school. Whatever I wanted I would set a goal to achieve. An amount. Always an amount. With the amount getting higher and higher every purchase I started taking money from anywhere. Do you want to move things out of your grandma’s house that just died, sure don’t mind the jewelry going missing. You want someone beat up doesn’t matter to me but money up front. Once I was out of high school I tried to grow up and walk the straight and narrow after the second chance with my juvenile record being sealed. So I got a factory job and cleaned my life up. But the money wasn’t enough. Rather than go back to less-than-legal means of making money I went for some side work instead. Which puts us exactly one week ago.

 Drinking coffee and scrolling through studies that were close to me on my phone. “Participants wanted for a clinical trial of our new drug Noctenol. Participants will receive $500 base pay and will be entitled to an increasing amount upon the continuation of the trial. The trial will last one week and participants must remain on-site at all times, however, participants reserve the right to leave at any time during the duration of the trial, but cannot return. Witness progress, witness the future with Noctenol.” seeing the base pay and that it could increase I called the supervisor and let him know that I would be using a week of paid vacation. He said that normally such short notice would result in my request being declined but since I had never missed a day of work since I started he said that he would make sure it was approved.

 I called the number at the bottom of the ad and received an automated system. “Atris Pharmaceuticals is the leading pharmaceutical company for behavioral and mental enhancing and healing medicine. Founded by the great Walter Jackson Freeman II on May 31, 1960, the company has become a pillar in the mental health and wellness community. With breakthroughs specifically in…” A young woman answered the phone. “Atris Pharmaceuticals, how may I help you?” the woman asked in a bubbly cheery voice. “Hi, I'm calling about your ad for the clinical trial of Noctenol.” “Oh, splendid!” she responded. “I'll just need your name, approximate weight and height, and age to get started and we can fill the rest out when you get here!” “Gabe, 180 lbs, 6 '5, 20 years old,” I responded. “Ok, hun that'll be all for now. Here is the address at 8:30 on Monday and we'll get started then. Don't just have an amazing day, have an Atris day!”

 The weekend flew by and I arrived at 8:00 and entered the building. Inside looked the same as any doctor's office a TV in the corner chairs in rows magazines on coffee tables and house plants in the corners. The wallpaper was a thick creamy color with brown trim at the bottom. Walking up to a square of plexiglass cut in the wall where the receptionist resided. “Hi, I'm here for the Noctenol trials?” “You're in the right place hun!” She ducked below the desk pulling out a stack of papers. “You'll need to fill these out before we can move forward!” “Thanks,” I said. I grabbed the stack and walked over to one of the chairs in the corner, sat down, and started filling it out. I signed all the general NDAs, waivers of liability, etc.. bringing the paperwork back up to the desk she filed it away and said “Follow me!”

 I followed her to the back room inside were office chairs and a big table with rolling whiteboards along the walls and papers strewn on the desk. “So mister…?” “Gabe. It's Gabe.” “Mister Gabe well go over what the study is about and what you have to do to participate in the trial. So you will be participating in a trial of the new drug Noctenol. Congratulations! Noctenol is a mental enhancement drug that in testing has been found to help control impulses and sudden urges. There are a few minor tweaks that need to be worked out before Noctenol is available for consumers on the open market. You will be in the final phase of testing. You will either be given Noctenol or a placebo. Neither you nor I will know which is which until the conclusion of the trial. To your left are five doors and five rooms each room will double the amount of money starting with $500 for the first room. You have five rooms a day for five days. The total upon completing the five days will be $77,500.” My mouth salivated at the thought of that much money and my mind drifted. “Mister Gabe? Mister Gabe?” “Huh” I asked. “Do you understand the parameters of this clinical trial as I have read them to you?” “ Oh uh, Yes.” “Great do you wish to proceed?” “Yes” “Great please stand and walk through the door to your left!” “Thanks”  “Oh and Mister Gabe!” “Yea?” “Good Luck!”.

She tells me that getting a coffee enema would fix me. Which, I mean, even if it did, I would not do it. I don't understand how someone can hear that a coffee enema cures acne and believe it. How could you believe it? I don't understand.

And I'm like, ""Okay, Mom, where are your sources?"" because this is the best way to disprove someone. And she's like, ""No, you look into it,"" like it's on me to disprove her, even though she brought the info. So, I go look it up on PubMed and other authorized sources, and obviously, there's nothing about coffee enemas being used to treat acne. So, I tell her that, and she says nothing, but she's probably still believing it. Like, your kid is studying this. Why does she not believe me? What does she think I do in school?

1ix22e6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1ix22e6/suspected_haunted_house/,suspected haunted house,"okay so let me start by saying we bought this house in december 2019 and moved into it in january 2020. the previous owners wife had died in the master bedroom a year or two prior to us buying the place. after she died, he was put in a retirement home, and listed the house for sale.

we moved in a month after buying the place (once all the renovations were complete) and it was good at first but after living here for 5 years, things have gotten really creepy. 

im going to trace back to when i said the previous owners wife died in the master bedroom. i have a good reason to believe her spirit is haunting this house. she smoked tobacco and drank coffee, not instant coffee sachets or pre ground coffee, she drank freshly ground and roasted coffee like youd get from a cafe.

you can wake up at any time in the night and smell tobacco, not smoke, just tobacco. like fresh tobacco youd roll a cigar with. it doesnt have to be at night to smell it, it can happen at any time during the day, usually at night though (please note: no one in this house smokes anything or drinks coffee. tea? yes. coffee? no)

you can also wake up at 2-3 in the morning and smell coffee. freshly roasted coffee as if your living with a barista.

it doesnt just end with smelling stuff. i was getting a drink at around 2 in the morning, whilst i was in the kitchen, i heard and saw a drawer open in the living room (living room, dining room and kitchen are connected, its hard to explain how without showing images but it is currently 12:25 am and i dont feel like getting up as its past the time i feel comfortable getting up without her watching my every move)

that terrified me so much i didnt even get my drink, i was halfway finished filling it up and the drawer slides open slowly but loudly, i put my cup down and basically sprinted back to my room. i am not easily frightened but when it comes to paranormal stuff like this, thats my breaking point.

this is most likely inaccurate but i have played a fair amount of phasmophobia, and without getting proper equipment and research done, based off the knowledge i have from the game, i can say i am dealing with either a spirit, poltergeist or banshee. i have had my tv remote softly thrown from my desk towards my door in broad daylight. one time i got woken up by a pair of shorts thrown at my window, not sure if she aimed to hit me or if it was intentionally thrown at the window. i am safe, i just need to tell someone about this as i feel someone here will understand what i am talking about, because ive spoken to friends about this and theyve said im just paranoid. if i come across any evidence, like orbs in any photos, anything like that, i will share it here.

How long does grieving last? I asked myself every single day for almost 3 years since my wife disappeared, and I never got an answer. The reminder that I was alone came every time I woke up and went to bed. Eventually, the reality sets in and I start to get used to eating alone, brushing my teeth alone, grocery shopping alone, and just being alone. I thought enough time had passed that I didn't have to ask myself that question anymore until the day I got a phone call from the nursing team who took care of my mother-in-law. Denise, the old lady, was planning on moving herself into a nearby nursing home, but now it sounds like she had too, passed.



When I arrived at their home I was met by one of the nurses who had taken care of Denise. She tried to leave quickly, not wanting to stay around the house long. We had a small conversation about where everything was in the home, and how most of the things inside were packed up and ready for storage, and then were given a set of keys for the house, each labeled with the rooms inside.



I tried to ask for more details, but all the nurse gave me was a passing chuckle as she turned to go to her car, getting inside and driving away without another word. It was a reasonable response when it involved anything that had to do with Denise. The old lady was going on 80 and was unbearable to be around. The last time I had spoken to her most of our conversation was loud coughing and nonsense.



The old house smelt like a hospital. Cardboard boxes were stacked randomly around the home with a thin layer of dust blanketing each surface. The TV and larger furniture stayed unpacked, only covered in a layer of plastic wrap. I was married to my wife for 5 years before she vanished, and I don't recall ever being in her childhood home. The old house sat in a suburban row of homes, all facing away from the tree line leading into the dense woods of the Pacific Northwest.



I stuffed the keys into my pockets and carefully squeezed between the stacked boxes. Small framed pictures of my wife at various ages still hung along the walls and sat across the small coffee table. I guess Denise wanted to take these in her bag, or maybe, like me, it was difficult to let her go.



With no one left in the family, the responsibility fell on me to take care of what was left of their belongings. I figured I would get the boxes to storage and clean the rest of the house before deciding what to do with it. I loaded a couple into my car, staring at the dishes and kitchenware, before stumbling on a pile of boxes with her name written across them.



“Gwen”



I read to the silent house. With a long deep breath, I carried the boxes to the coffee table and opened them. Inside were articles of clothing, old bound notebooks, photo albums, and school memorabilia. I flipped through them, and seeing her on every page brought tears. Her smile lit up each sun-faded page, and each wood frame she was captured in threatened to set on fire with her warmth. These boxes were going to stay with me.



I dried my tears and kept going, wanting to see more of her. I moved away a pile of old clothes and notebooks when my hand met something hard and hollow. Buried at the bottom of one of the boxes, were a hefty bag of small CDs, and a handheld video camera. I pulled them out and immediately went to turn it on. Unsurprisingly, the old thing wouldn't turn on, and the battery compartment was corroded shut with the old batteries still inside. I wrestled with it in the kitchen with a butter knife and got it opened and cleaned, then with the double As from the TV remote, got the thing to switch on. I inspected the camera again, excited to get it working, and saw it had a name written in marker on the side.



“Gwen”



I shuffled through the CDs, each labeled with a date, a few not. The first was for her 8th birthday, the small red-haired girl's face was right up in the camera lens, peering in with her bright steel blue eyes. She let out an excited squeal and ran to hug her parents, thanking her mom and dad for the expensive gift. I guess filmmaking had always been her passion. Her father responded with something unintelligible, and a heavy cough before he left the frame. I had never met the man when he was alive, and she never talked much about him. A moment later he returned with a big birthday cake, and then the three ate it together. The rest of the CD was just them eating before shutting off randomly. The old CDs didn't have that much storage, each having only about 20 minutes of memory.



I spent the next few hours going through her childhood. Several moments in the videos I recall her telling me about, late nights when we would lay in bed and talk until sunrise, other moments just small silly things a child with a video camera would film. Her father eventually showed up less and less in the videos, his cough worsening every time until he was no longer in them. For a long while the videos stopped, a large year-long gap before I saw her face again. Her smiles were never the same, she talked less, and some videos were just her talking about her day to her father and writing silently in her notebooks. Eventually, the pile of memories grew smaller and smaller, and when I almost reached the end of the dated discs, I decided to take a look at one without any date on it.



Heavy breathing interlaced with the crackle of the built-in microphone blasted through the tiny speakers, filling up the empty home more than everything else that night. The screen was dark, with only a small light coming from the left corner of the video. The lens stuttered and focused, eventually I was able to make out a line of trees and a street light, but the image was still blurred. It stayed focused on the dark woods for another moment before the camera was pushed forward, hitting a glass surface before it struggled to focus once again, the heavy breathing of my wife still close to the microphone.



I leaned in as if it would help the video focus, the blurry tree line being barely visible in the dark. Between the breaths of my wife, I could hear the camera force itself to focus, sharpening itself until the woods got steadily more and more visible. The camera stayed like that for 18 minutes, glued in position, and so did my wife. My eyes stayed trained on the trees just like she was in the video, watching for any movement at all, only leaving the treeline to check the timer on the video. It got to 19 minutes, and then as it slowly reached its end something shifted in the trees. The video ended, blinding me with the harsh blue menu of the settings screen.



Immediately I replaced the disk with another unmarked one. The next one was during the day, She stood just at the edge of the woods, camera raised and pointed towards the thick darkness created by the trees. The normally tranquil sounds of birds and nature in the background were sometimes interrupted by a heavy cough. Each time the camera fell for a moment I imagined she tried to stifle her cough. I watched again to the end of this video, all 20 minutes of just the camera pointed into the woods, but nothing happened.



The following four undated videos also showed nothing, just my wife, at various points and locations around her house, filming the woods for twenty minutes. The audio was always just background noise, coughing, and the mechanical whirl of the camera's focus. On the last dated one, I could see her reflection in the window as she filmed.  
She sat in the kitchen, the camera pointed towards the window above her sink, and the tree line beyond her yard. She was probably about 15 or 16 at this point, looking just like the first time we had met in high school. The camera tried to focus again on the woods, zooming between her reflection and the tree line. She let out another cough, this time just a brief one, and then opened a bottle of pills, swallowing them dry before letting the camera roll to its end. I had run out of CDs.



I stood from my spot on the ground and turned towards the kitchen window. It was now nighttime, making the darkness of the treeline even more oppressing than it was a few moments earlier on the screen. I stood and stared for a moment like she did, trying to scan the dark with my eyes but the trees stayed the same.



With a shudder, I pulled the blinds down to shut the window and made my way back to the with the help of my phone light. There were no more videos. I carelessly dumped out the rest of the boxes with her name on them across the floor and found nothing. Realizing what I'd done to what I had left of my wife I started to mournfully repack her items neatly into the boxes when I accidentally kicked something across the ground.



Her notebooks. I picked them up and laid them across the coffee table. There were only 3 of them, one of them a locked toy Barbie notebook that I wasn't going to get open unless I smashed the thing and the other two old leather bound style books. I carefully unwrapped the straps around them and flipped through the weathered pages, mostly filled with bits of writing and drawings.



Across the two available notebooks, her art style visibly improved and she wrote less and less. Like the videos, the drawings were about her and her parents. Unfortunately, they were almost exactly like the videos, chronicling and recording how ill her father eventually got more and more ill. The drawings and entries transitioned from them getting ice cream, hiking, and summer barbecues to hospital visits, sitting on their back porch, and looking into the woods. Then it was just the woods. The second half of her third notebook was just pages and pages of the trees, and nothing more, until the last two pages.



The graphite of the pencil was aggressively forced into the paper, splaying out an image of the tree line into the last two pages of her notebook. I ran my fingers along each tree and could feel them etched into the page, the black powder left behind by her pencil so long ago still stained my fingertips. In the middle of the page, done by what I assumed was an eraser trying to remove the forest from the notebook, stood a gaunt figure towering over the trees.



I closed the notebooks and set them back in the box and sealed them once again. I turned on every light in the house, first the entire ground floor, before making my way to the upstairs. I wanted to snuff out every single dark corner of this home to chase away a fear I refused to acknowledge. I shifted through the key chain in my pocket, entered every room, and turned on every light until I reached the locked door at the end of the hallway. I had one key left, one with her name written on the small tag that clung to it.



“Gwen”



Two times the keys fell out of my hands until I finally got them into the lock. It didn't click like the rest of the doors, but instead, the lock turned with a rusted and sticky scrape. I thought Denise was joking when she said she had left my wife's room the same as the day she left and never opened it, but I realize now that she was telling the truth. I coughed hard as I pushed on the door. It took an agonizing amount of force to open, and as it did it pushed something across the floor, sending dust from on top of the door frame down on my head. My hand reached for where the light switch should be but couldn't find anything. I opened the door wider so that the light from the hallway could spill into the room enough for me to see.



Her desk was stacked with at least a hundred of the same leather-bound notebooks she had in her box, the strap barely holding them close as they were stuffed with extra sheets of paper. Scattered across the ground were even more of them, their pages ripped out. Moonlight tried to enter the room through the window but was forced back by something covering the glass. I took out my phone to shine its light across the walls to see where the ripped pages went. Across every surface possible were drawings of the woods.",3,1740403568.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

How long does grieving last? I asked myself every single day for almost 3 years since my wife disappeared, and I never got an answer. The reminder that I was alone came every time I woke up and went to bed. Eventually, the reality sets in and I start to get used to eating alone, brushing my teeth alone, grocery shopping alone, and just being alone. I thought enough time had passed that I didn't have to ask myself that question anymore until the day I got a phone call from the nursing team who took care of my mother-in-law. Denise, the old lady, was planning on moving herself into a nearby nursing home, but now it sounds like she had too, passed.



When I arrived at their home I was met by one of the nurses who had taken care of Denise. She tried to leave quickly, not wanting to stay around the house long. We had a small conversation about where everything was in the home, and how most of the things inside were packed up and ready for storage, and then were given a set of keys for the house, each labeled with the rooms inside.



I tried to ask for more details, but all the nurse gave me was a passing chuckle as she turned to go to her car, getting inside and driving away without another word. It was a reasonable response when it involved anything that had to do with Denise. The old lady was going on 80 and was unbearable to be around. The last time I had spoken to her most of our conversation was loud coughing and nonsense.



The old house smelt like a hospital. Cardboard boxes were stacked randomly around the home with a thin layer of dust blanketing each surface. The TV and larger furniture stayed unpacked, only covered in a layer of plastic wrap. I was married to my wife for 5 years before she vanished, and I don't recall ever being in her childhood home. The old house sat in a suburban row of homes, all facing away from the tree line leading into the dense woods of the Pacific Northwest.



I stuffed the keys into my pockets and carefully squeezed between the stacked boxes. Small framed pictures of my wife at various ages still hung along the walls and sat across the small coffee table. I guess Denise wanted to take these in her bag, or maybe, like me, it was difficult to let her go.



With no one left in the family, the responsibility fell on me to take care of what was left of their belongings. I figured I would get the boxes to storage and clean the rest of the house before deciding what to do with it. I loaded a couple into my car, staring at the dishes and kitchenware, before stumbling on a pile of boxes with her name written across them.



“Gwen”



I read to the silent house. With a long deep breath, I carried the boxes to the coffee table and opened them. Inside were articles of clothing, old bound notebooks, photo albums, and school memorabilia. I flipped through them, and seeing her on every page brought tears. Her smile lit up each sun-faded page, and each wood frame she was captured in threatened to set on fire with her warmth. These boxes were going to stay with me.



I dried my tears and kept going, wanting to see more of her. I moved away a pile of old clothes and notebooks when my hand met something hard and hollow. Buried at the bottom of one of the boxes, were a hefty bag of small CDs, and a handheld video camera. I pulled them out and immediately went to turn it on. Unsurprisingly, the old thing wouldn't turn on, and the battery compartment was corroded shut with the old batteries still inside. I wrestled with it in the kitchen with a butter knife and got it opened and cleaned, then with the double As from the TV remote, got the thing to switch on. I inspected the camera again, excited to get it working, and saw it had a name written in marker on the side.



“Gwen”



I shuffled through the CDs, each labeled with a date, a few not. The first was for her 8th birthday, the small red-haired girl's face was right up in the camera lens, peering in with her bright steel blue eyes. She let out an excited squeal and ran to hug her parents, thanking her mom and dad for the expensive gift. I guess filmmaking had always been her passion. Her father responded with something unintelligible, and a heavy cough before he left the frame. I had never met the man when he was alive, and she never talked much about him. A moment later he returned with a big birthday cake, and then the three ate it together. The rest of the CD was just them eating before shutting off randomly. The old CDs didn't have that much storage, each having only about 20 minutes of memory.



I spent the next few hours going through her childhood. Several moments in the videos I recall her telling me about, late nights when we would lay in bed and talk until sunrise, other moments just small silly things a child with a video camera would film. Her father eventually showed up less and less in the videos, his cough worsening every time until he was no longer in them. For a long while the videos stopped, a large year-long gap before I saw her face again. Her smiles were never the same, she talked less, and some videos were just her talking about her day to her father and writing silently in her notebooks. Eventually, the pile of memories grew smaller and smaller, and when I almost reached the end of the dated discs, I decided to take a look at one without any date on it.



Heavy breathing interlaced with the crackle of the built-in microphone blasted through the tiny speakers, filling up the empty home more than everything else that night. The screen was dark, with only a small light coming from the left corner of the video. The lens stuttered and focused, eventually I was able to make out a line of trees and a street light, but the image was still blurred. It stayed focused on the dark woods for another moment before the camera was pushed forward, hitting a glass surface before it struggled to focus once again, the heavy breathing of my wife still close to the microphone.



I leaned in as if it would help the video focus, the blurry tree line being barely visible in the dark. Between the breaths of my wife, I could hear the camera force itself to focus, sharpening itself until the woods got steadily more and more visible. The camera stayed like that for 18 minutes, glued in position, and so did my wife. My eyes stayed trained on the trees just like she was in the video, watching for any movement at all, only leaving the treeline to check the timer on the video. It got to 19 minutes, and then as it slowly reached its end something shifted in the trees. The video ended, blinding me with the harsh blue menu of the settings screen.

Same with the breakfast place next to me, my partner and I went about 2 weeks ago and noticed everything was 1.50 more expensive than when we went the month before (tea and coffees had only gone up by around 50c). It was a smaller portion than the last time too, so with 1.50 more per breakfast and a smaller portion they have completly lost our business. 

Had been due to meet friends for food but any of my usual spots I checked the menu and nearly all had gone up by mininum 1-2euro on nearly all menu items. 

Did something happen in the last two weeks to see such a large price increase? I saw a lot of places pressuing the goervnment to drop vat back to 9% and it seems really cheeky to ask for that and then throw on a massive price increase on top of that. 

I've really reduced the amount I eat out and support local business due ot the prices, prior to this, and to be honest I will be cutting back even further because it just seems like greed at this stage.",30,1740403465.0,AskIreland,36,0.97,False

I have a 10oz tumbler (like this: https://www.yeti.com/drinkware/tumblers/21071504701.html).  I love it and it works great.  What's even cooler is that the lid also fits my small 6 oz ceramic-lined coffee cups.  I usually drink coffee from one of these at home, but if I have to run an errand in the car I'll throw a lid on it,

Anyway, with this smaller lid the Magslider sticks.  I'll clean it, scrub it, dry it, but when I go to use it the next time, it is usually stuck.  It takes a lot of force (or I have to pop it off and back on) to get it to slide. If I don't remember to do it before I put it on my cup, I risk spilling or not being able to get it open.  I've never had this happen with my larger Yeti lids.

So does anyone else see this issue in these smaller lids?  I almost wonder if I need to take sandpaper to the lid, but I can't see or feel any sort of rough spot or defect.

Late at night, staring at the ceiling, thinking about what could have been. The career we didn’t chase. The person we never became. The passions we let fade. Regret creeps in when we least expect it. It can feel like a weight we will never shake off.

But here is the thing. Beating yourself up for the past does nothing but drain the energy you could use to build your future. Every choice you made, every path you did not take, shaped who you are today. And guess what? You are still here. You are still breathing. That means you have time. Time to start. Time to pivot. Time to be better.

Forgiving yourself is not about pretending the past did not happen. It is about acknowledging it, learning from it, and then letting it go. You cannot change yesterday, but you have full control over what you do next.

Pick up that hobby you abandoned. Sign up for that class. Reach out to that person. It does not have to be a massive leap. Small steps add up. Regret might knock at your door sometimes, but you do not have to invite it in for coffee.

1ix1w8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ix1w8j/asking_someone_out_who_approached_me_while_i_was/,Asking someone out who approached me while I was in a relationship,"TL;DR at bottom. 

In November, I \[22M\] was studying in the university library when a girl \[?F\] approached me and gave me a piece of paper. In this note, she asked if I would like to get a coffee sometime and left her phone number. At the time, I was in a long-term relationship (2.5 years), so I obviously did not act on this. However, I did genuinely appreciate the way she went about doing it (very respectful, low pressure), so I texted her to let her know that I was flattered but not available. Again, her response was very polite and respectful. I then deleted the conversation from my phone but kept the note (before you write a critical comment please read further for more context). 

Around the time this happened, I had already begun to question whether or not I should stay in the relationship I was in. Long story short, my ex-girlfriend \[21F\] had some personal issues (behavioural and mental health issues) which had a significant impact on our relationship. I told her that these issues had a major impact on me and were very difficult for me to cope with. She struggled to accept that this was the case and never did any real work on them; at this point, I realised that for my own sake (and hers), it would probably be best to go our separate ways. My main point here (and what I would like to emphasise) is that when I was given the note, I had begun seriously questioning our relationship and began to seriously consider breaking up. Because I knew that the end of relationship was coming, I kept the note that the girl in the library gave me (\* see below).

Two months later, I ended up breaking up with my ex for the reasons mentioned above. Because I had already been thinking about ending the relationship for some time before, I think that I already did a lot of the mourning and processing during that time. In addition to that, I have done a lot of active work to move past the relationship and look to the future. Now, roughly 6 weeks after breaking up with her, I genuinely feel ready to at least go on some dates. 

My main question is this: is it okay for me to text this girl to ask her if she is still up for coffee? I would feel kind of guilty doing this, but the thing is: there was a clear, strong mutual attraction between us and she made a really good impression on me. I know that if I never ask her on a date, I will regret it. Also, this is my last year in university and it’s possible that if I wait, I will never get the chance to meet her. 

What do I do? Am I crazy for thinking about doing this? Am I an asshole? Idk…any advice appreciated, and I’m happy to clarify anything in the comments. 

Thank you in advance

(\*) Before anyone tears me apart in the comments, let me emphasise that I know this was not the most fair on my part, and that it could be interpreted as “stringing her along”. Please understand that the situation was complicated by her mental health issues and initiating a breakup earlier on would have been really poor timing due to some stuff that she was dealing with. ;

TL;DR: A girl gave me her number when I knew I was at the tail end of a long-term relationship, so I rejected her but kept her number. Several months later, after breaking up with my ex, I feel a deep curiosity and desire to try to get to know her, but I also feel guilty about it. What do I do?

Alright, let’s talk music production.  

It’s more than just pressing record and hoping for the best. It’s that beautiful mix of technical know-how, creativity, and sometimes... sheer luck. One minute you're tweaking EQ like a scientist, the next, you're chasing down a melody at 2 AM because your brain won’t let it go.  

But here’s the deal: good production isn’t just about making something sound professional—it’s about making something *feel* alive.  

### Some things to keep in mind:  

- **Production isn’t about fixing, it’s about enhancing.** If a song isn’t strong at its core, no amount of reverb is going to save it. Nail the fundamentals first.  
- **Tools don’t make the song, but they sure help.** Don’t get lost in chasing plugins you *think* you need. A great idea recorded badly is still better than a bad idea with pristine sonics.  
- **Your ears need breaks.** You ever mix for hours only to wake up the next day and realize your snare sounds like a trash can? Yeah. Ears get tired. Rest them.  
- **Less is (usually) more.** The best producers know when *not* to add something. Just because you *can* layer 20 synth pads doesn’t mean you *should*.  

### What really matters:  

Music production is at its best when it's serving the *emotion* of the song. The way a mix builds tension, the way certain frequencies create warmth—it all plays into how a song makes a listener *feel*.  

It’s easy to get caught up in waveforms and compressors, but the real question is… does it move you? Would you care about this song if it was playing in the background of a coffee shop? Would it grab your attention—or just blend into the noise?   

And here’s one last thought: don't wait for perfect. Just *start*. The best producers aren’t the ones with the best gear, they’re the ones who got their hands dirty and figured it out.

What is my dream itinerary? No Louvre, no Galleries Lafayette, no Notre Dame and no Arc de Triomphe. And definitely no rushing from one thing to another.  You will see there are busy days and light days: mix it up.

**NOTE:** this is not a judgment on these things, just my personal experience and opinion. You do you.

Missing here is nightlife, as it's not my priority. I like history, Medieval art, weird stuff, books and walking.

And as for eating, you can go almost anywhere! Outside of very touristy areas, almost al of the cheese shops, cafes, boulangeries and markets are good to excellent, just go try things.

1. Wander around the neighborhood you are staying in, or along the Seine or up to Montmartre. A little exercise helps with jet lag.  Get a coffee, or a slow lunch, people watch. Don't pressure yourself. Let something catch your eye and explore.

2. Latin Quarter, go to the Museum of Middle Ages Cluny, wander Shakespeare and Co bookstore, maybe check out the special nuns at Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal and get pates de fruit at the Grand Epicerie. Go to Jardin Luxembourg, look at dogs. Or if the weather is poor, go down into the Catacombs.

3. Spend the entire day going to flea markets, street markets and/or thrift stores

4. The Crypte Archéologique is amazing, across from Notre Dame. If the ND line is short, pop in, but otherwise just look at the outside. Go to Musee Chasse et Nature, shop for perfume in the streets around it, and maybe do Musee Carnavalet or Orsay.

5. Pompidou Center, spend some time taking in the view, and then walk around the Marais. Go in boutiques and little queer bookstores. Get a falafel. Maybe find a place for a nice dinner.

6. Travel to Bercy for Musee des Arts Forains-it is amazing, then spend the afternoon at the Castle Vincennes. 

7. Last day! Buy a few presents, and have a picnic at Arenes de Lutece: Roman ruins. Watch pétanque players. Attend a church service or find a church to admire. Get a little lost, don't worry too much about it. Return to anything you liked, maybe go view the Eiffel Tower if you need photos for the gram. But some art supplies you don't need or walk in the cemetery.",6,1740403239.0,ParisTravelGuide,0,0.88,False
1ix1uwk,https://i.redd.it/epy02uvc83le1.jpeg,SavorWorks - India Godfather Panama Geisha,"

**Impressions:**

At **2700 INR for 250g**, I was expecting something extraordinary, especially given the hype around this Gesha variety from Riverdale, and apparently how good the Corridor Seven version was a couple of months ago. Unfortunately, after 10 brews, I’m not convinced it justifies the price.

**Brewing Experience:**

I tested this coffee after resting it for 10 days and with multiple methods such as Hario V60, Hario Switch, and Origami, with water temps between 93-100°C. The only method that worked and brought out some of the flavor profile was the Hario Switch. Every other method either didn’t bring out the flavor complexity, or I couldn't get the full range of tasting notes I expected. Even during cupping, some of the prominent flavors didn’t come through.

**Comparison to International Geshas:**

Having tried Panama Geshas from international roasters like Passenger Coffee, USA (for around 1500 INR for 150g) and Letty Bermudez Gesha from Manhattan Roasters, Netherlands (which is a lot more expensive than Passenger and SavorWorks, and not a fair comparison), I was honestly disappointed with this. The flavors were far more expressive and consistent in those cups and one could consistently brew tasty cups.

**Value for Money:**

At 2700 INR for 250g, the SavorWorks Godfather did not feel like a great value for money. The Panama Gesha variety is some of the finest in the coffee industry, and it's either the roasting that did not bring out the flavours or the Carbonic Maceration processing from the farm that needs work. For 2700, you can get 5-6 bags from other roasters like Grey Soul, Corridor Seven and Kaapi Kottai who have some great beans.

**Final Thoughts:**

While the SavorWorks Godfather offered me the opportunity to try an Indian-grown Panama Geisha, it didn't impress me enough to justify the price, but SavorWorks delivered a freshly roasted bag in 3 days to Bangalore which is faster than a lot of Indian roasters.

This is mostly a rant but I would also like some advice about how to handle it when my JUSTNOMIL inevitably comes back around (probably pretending like nothing happened) because she wants to see her grandson.

I have been with my husband for 5 years, mostly got along with MIL, she lived 1 hour away and we don't live in my home country, so she's the only thing resembling ""family"" here. We would visit every 2 weeks and keep it civil.

Of course everything changed once I got pregnant. We also moved in to her old house (she left it to DH when his dad passed, and it was rented out). She starting making weird requests like access to the garden because it broughther good memories (she had her own garden and lived 1 hour away...) it blew up when she was constantly coming through the garden even though we were in the house and asked her to ring the bell.

She also doesn't get along with her son so every time he tries to put on a boundary they fight.
After the baby is born I had to put up with endless comments, how my milk must be too watery/ too little, asking why we don't give formula, why do we use pacifier, why don't I use a better shampoo, what I am doing to lose the weight. My answers are always noncommittal or blankly ""because we decided so"" ""the doctor said so"" etc. I tried to keep her at bay without causing (more) problems (than those she already has with her own son).

After the baby was born she secretly moved closer while we were on holidays (!!) And has been increasing the visits. At first I tolerated because we were gone for almost 2 months with the baby. I also told DH he has to handle it. She also never asks for a visit to see baby, rather comes up with stupid reasons to come like she forgot something, she needs to borrow something before Thursday, she needs to give something back, etc. She then asks for coffee and asks if we have cookies or if we ever bake -""no"".

I had kept her visits short by having baby sleep or go to sleep when she comes. But last week all went to hell. She came by on Wednesday after being here on Monday. We were just about to have lunch so I offered she could feed the baby while we eat. It was a bad idea. Baby doesn't eat much yet and she was trying to push the spoon in his mouth. We said repeatedly, don't do it, if he does not open the mouth don't force it. She kept trying, we kept saying no, I was trying to model for her what was ok and she said ""let me try it my way"" to which I replied ""no, it's out baby, our way"". She stopped feeding him after that.

Later baby was playing with some wooden toy and she kept going ""what's this toy? Is it glued together? How is it built? I wouldn't give it to the baby."" I said ""It's a toy for babies and I gave it to him. No need to worry"". She then left. I was not pleased but told DH ""I can be nice to her once or twice a week. If she comes over more often than that, she sometimes will get an attitude"". He agreed. 

On Friday (!!!) she came to pick something up, rang the bell and DH went off on her telling her she needs to wait for him to come to the door, that baby was sleeping (she called first but then immediately rang). She then went on her own rant about how we are not nice to her, how I was nicer before and now I was mean to her and insulted her (literal lie). I was in the same room but she was not addressing me so I didn't react. She was complaining that I said it's our baby (!!!!) and that she can also say things (yes but doesn't mean we need to act on it). She topped it off by saying we made her (old) kitchen very dirty, she wants everything back, and I am a dirty woman and he should be ashamed. DH basically chased her out of the house.
Oh and then she wrote a text that she expects an apology. DH wrote back we don't want her in our lives.

We haven't heard anything since the incident last week. I am at a loss. I never had something like this happen with my family or anyone, for that matter. These outbursts had only happened with my husband when I'm not there. I don't feel like ever seeing her again, but I'm afraid my husband is more used to it and will eventually get back in touch. I could manage her in small dosis, but she's the give an inch, take a mile kind. I don't feel like I want my baby around someone so volatile and who doesn't respect me, who's just looking for an excuse to stab you in the back. I told DH, she got what she wanted, she's the victim and we are the unthankful crazies who keep the grandson from her.

I could accept her back in small dosis if she ever apologizes, but I don't think she will. 

So, that's the rant. Any advice on what to say when she inevitably asks to see the baby? Am I overreacting? Should I eventually allow her back in our lives (if she ever apologizes)? ",2,1740403223.0,JUSTNOMIL,1,1.0,False

1ix1u2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ix1u2k/bring_me_a_dream/,Bring me a dream.,"I haven’t slept well lately. It’s not a particularly uncommon problem, but I am afraid my cause might be a bit abnormal. Falling asleep happens easily enough. It’s more of an issue of staying asleep. Over the past few days, what happens when I wake in the night has a death grip on my psyche.

A few days ago, I came downstairs to see my wife, Katie, drinking coffee while our toddler kept herself entertained with a cardboard box. I poured a mug of morning elixir. I slightly kicked at the box and hopped around the child.

“Caroline, we could save a fortune giving you boxes to play with instead of toys.”

“I am surprised you are up already,” Katie raised her eyes and looked over her mug.

I stretched in my seat “Well, I like to sleep in but it’s not exactly early.”

“Yeah, but you tossed and turned all night,” Katie replied as she rinsed her mug.

“Par for the course,” I laughed. Nights of rest were long gone before having children, let alone after. Waking up in the night in panic, checking a monitor for the relief of safety. Questioning shadows in the dark or if the door locks were steadfast in their duty. Last night was one of hundreds, and thousands yet to come.

“Sure, but why did you do that arm thing, you wouldn’t stop”. She looked at me, slightly confused, maybe even concerned. The cardboard box was loudly being ripped across by a green colored pencil as Caroline had decided to decorate.

  
“Arm thing? What are you talking about?” Suddenly, I shifted uneasy as my shoulder felt a bit stiff.

I had no clue what she could have meant. I couldn’t recall the dreamless night before. Not unlike nights ahead. I may not sleep like a log, but I couldn’t remember waking up, let alone doing something during the night.

Katie chuckled “I turned over and you had your arm pointed straight up in the air”.  
  
“Huh, like my fingers pointed straight up?”  
  
“No, more like limp wristed,” she replied with a demonstration. She slid down her chair, sat her mug down and raised on arm up. Caroline let out a giggle, laid down and raised both her arms up while kicking her legs. “No no no!”

  
“I guess that’s sorta odd,” I shrugged with a chuckle at Caroline’s display. Now she had gotten on all fours and started snorting heavily. “See! See!”

I had bouts of sleepwalking when I was younger, slammed my nose directly into a door frame, woken up to falling into my bed. I suppose hanging my arm up wasn’t that far of a stretch.

Nothing to worry about, all sorts of weird instincts and functions happen when you sleep. My arm probably fell asleep from laying on it. The more I thought about it, the more I felt the ache in my shoulder. I rotated it a few times around feeling it pop.

“I probably just slept on it,” I told her, finishing up my last bit of coffee.

“Yeah, probably. When are we leaving to go to the park?” Katie asked as she picked up Caroline.

“Whenever, I just need to get dressed.”

&nbsp;

Barring some tantrums over leaving the park, the day progressed in tranquility. I didn’t even give our conversation a second thought. It burrowed far into the recess of my mind.

After we came home and I spent some time coaxing a small child to sleep with fantasy tales of princesses and the knights that rescue them from wicked creatures, Katie and I spent some time on the couch and went to begin the bedtime routine.

“Luke, don’t tell Caroline scary stories, I get that you like scary stuff but she’s still little.”  
  
I was in the middle of changing my clothes when Katie spoke. It had taken a moment to process the censure. She sat with her back against the backboard arms crossed waiting for my retort.  
  
“What? Scary stories? I don’t think a rescued princess is that scary.”

“You’re going to scare her, some of the stuff she repeats are a bit much.”  
  
I had no idea what she meant. Katie could find worry in fresh cut grass if it were to acquaint with Caroline.  
  
“Like a giant killer shark?” I replied, shaking my knees with feigned fear.

“I am serious,” she glared to confirm the statement.

“Sure honey, I will tone it down,” I reassure as we lie down. As I kissed her cheek and felt the comfort of the blanket, I thought to adapt less monsters and more villains moving forward with the bedtime wonders.

“Where did you come up with it anyway?”  
  
“With what?”  
  
“The monster you told her about last night.”

Last night, I regaled Caroline with a story about a fur footed girl traveling with a handsome wizard, they happened to look strikingly like Caroline and myself. They unfortunately ran into large hungry trolls. The descriptions of the snarls and hunger for flesh must have stuck with her.  
  
“That would be my fantastic creativity.”  
  
“Yeah, okay, and when she watches those movies she is going to know what a thief you are.”


&nbsp;

 

Sure enough, the next morning came as it always did. My phone wailed out in distress, I silenced it and began to wrestle with the exhaustion in my eyes. First things first, I stared at the baby monitor and found our little girl still sleeping, safe and sound. No dreams of sharks, trolls or even dragons.

Abandoning the warmth of my bed I convinced my body to make my way to her room. After I turned the knob, I felt my hand slide around the metal. Looking down at my hand there was a powdery black substance that had smeared on my hand. It kind of looked like ash or soot. Did we have something on our hands when we closed the door? Maybe some sort of oil in the handle was leaking out? I wasn’t sure. I wiped my hand across a pant leg, the interruption escaping my thoughts.

I opened Caroline’s door, not trying to be very loud but not quiet either. She is lying in her small bed, supporting her entire body with her head as usual.

“Good morning honey, you ready for breakfast?” my voice interrupted the silence of the room. I gave her a gentle shake and brushed her hair.  
  
The sheets slightly jerked on the bed as she stirred and then yawned, expelling the night from her body. I kept soothing her awake as I looked around her room. She had left her closet door open; she had been found guilty of getting out of bed during the night and roaming around her room. A reasonable deduction as I noticed some of her toys watching me out of the dark of the door.

I stood up and opened the door and began pushing the toys back out of the opening. On the hardwood, I discovered more ash.

“Huh, Caroline did you break a crayon? It’s all over the floor.”  
  
“No dada” she slurred as she sat up.

Kids lie, maybe they’re afraid of punishment, maybe because it just makes sense to them in the moment. Who knows why.

“Okay, well baby, when you make a mess, you need to let mommy or daddy know. You got, whatever, this is on our door too.”

Caroline waddled over to me and pulled my leg. “I didn’t daddy. Baa baa did”.

I picked her up, making sure that she didn’t get any of the mess on her. Nothing too bad, just a bit her feet. Staring at the floor I could find the evidence where she had tracked it to her bed. We head out of her room towards the kitchen. “Well, Baa baa needs to tell me.”  
  
“He will.”

Kids are weird, and they otherwise do or say outright creepy things. After dealing with it for years you stop really thinking about it. We go back to my bedroom and gently, as gentle as a child can be, we wake up Katie and eat breakfast before I must go to work.

&nbsp;


During work hours find it in themselves to move slowly. I kept a healthy dose of caffeine to keep the exasperation at bay. The drive home would have been as mundane as any other time if it weren’t for the detour thrust upon me.

Wipers swiped across my windshield, erasing away the rain that pouring down. I had just came over a hill to find there is a commotion impeding everyone’s drive home. An older man in a yellow jacket was waving everyone to take a left up the hill. A slight backroad that shortly circled back to the main road after a ways. I usually keep to myself but eyeing this scene stirred something in me to be a bit nosey. As I slowly came up the man I rolled down my window, paying the price in rain battering my face.

“Hey! What’s going on?”

The man raised his hand to his mouth to speak over the weather, “A bunch of pigs broke out of a truck and started running into the river! They are all over the road! Someone totaled their car into one of them! Go!”

The man waves me off to the turn. He had no more time for explanation. Pulling up the road slowly I peak over my passenger side to try to make out the scene. I have heard a tale or two in my life but cannot say that suicidal pigs were something I was familiar with. 

There was a truck with a livestock trailer with the gate ruptured open, no doubt from the escape of the herd. A small white sedan sat crumpled against one of the beasts. Its corpse had erupted over the hood like sausage burst from its casing.

A woman held her head with a cloth as she overlooked the damage to her vehicle. A man, the herdsmen maybe, stood on the side of the road staring at the legion of animals that had made it to the water. If he was upset, he hid it well. He just stood there, arms hanging to his sides, vacant expression and eyes sunken.

After the detour, it was the journey as usual. We repeated our cozy routine. Ate dinner, played games with Caroline making up rules as befitting of her victory, and within short order it was time to put her to bed.

This time I told her the story about a man who must save his wife from a bunch of bad men in a skyscraper. Adding as much silliness as I can for a small child’s amusement. After she is tucked in, I made my way to the exit.  
  
“Daddy I want a good dream.”

“I am sure you will one baby.” I waited at the door to entertain the jovial questioning that tends to prolong going to sleep.

“Do you have good dreams?” She yawns out her question.

“Daddy doesn’t have dream honey. When I was younger, I got hurt and now daddy doesn’t really dream anymore,” I confessed to her.

“Ohh,” she tiredly replies, most likely not understanding what I said.

“I dream a lot,” she disclosed as she turns to get a better look at me. “My dreams talk about you daddy.”

I softly smiled “Well, I am glad you dream of me sweetie”.

“No daddy, my dreams talk about you, I don’t see you.”

“Oh? And do they tell you about how strong and handsome I am?” with a soft chuckle I leaned on the frame waiting for her answer.

“They told me to ask you about your dreams.”

“Ha, well like I said honey, I don’t really dream.”  
  
Just a few days prior she had asked me if I see through my own eyes, or do I see my full body like she does. Children are full of learning and trying to comprehend reality around them. At the time it just seemed like one of those times. The only reason it is obviously strange now is due to the events that proceeded it. Today, I would question everything even slightly odd.  
  
“Maybe that’s good,” Caroline yawned once more, and I knew it was my cue to let her drift off.


&nbsp;
 

Katie and I eventually go to sleep after some short chatter. As for what I told Caroline, when I was about 5 years old, I got clipped by a car. I was in the hospital for weeks; my skull was cracked alongside several other injuries. As I recovered, it appeared that aside of no longer having dreams, I would be relatively normal. The doctors told my parents that all things considered, it was the best outcome from such a severe head injury. I can’t complain, I would trade dreams for an able body. There were talks of long term affects and I have routinely been through scans and follows up my whole life to make sure we can catch any further complications should they arise.

There was the issue of how I got clipped by the car, the driver swore that I ran into her. According to her, I wasn’t playing or chasing, I just ran into the cars path. She swore that she had seen me standing beside the road, that I was obviously following the traffic visually. Then as she got too close to stop, I jumped in front of her car. If it had been an SUV or a Truck, I probably wouldn’t have problems sleeping today. But with her small sedan, I rolled up and over the hood, cracking her windshield as she slammed her brakes. She made no effort to abandon me and was the first to call for an ambulance. To this day I am sure she hadn’t done any wrongdoing.

I do not know why I ran out in front of her car, most of my childhood prior to the accident is fogged either by youth or the trauma of the accident itself. My parents said I slipped out of the door, sneaking out like kids tend to do. According to them they were carrying in groceries and one moment later I was no longer playing with toys on the floor.

There was some minor strife as the state had assigned a case worker to make sure my home was safe and proper. Outside of some cases of bruises, that everyone assured was due to the accident, the case worker found nothing to be alarming. Life went back to normal, and I grew up healthy and fine, albeit without a single fantasy to keep my slumbering mind busy.

This night though, I found myself dreaming.


&nbsp;
 

For a nameless reason, my eyelids sparked open, allowing the darkness of the room to obscure my vision. I looked over and could make out Katie sleeping beside me and I began to shift my weight over to my side. Only, I couldn’t.

Quick unease stirred in me. My eyes scan around, I seen a hand floating above my chest. My arm suspended above me, just as Katie claimed. I pulled it down to my side, at least the command struck from my mind, but my body quietly ignored it. My unease was becoming panic. I couldn’t move.

I kept trying to move any part of myself, only my eyes would obey. In my mental fumbling, my vision found something, something that shouldn’t have been there. In the doorway, they sat. I uselessly think to shout out to Katie.

“Luke.”

I would have jumped and screamed if only my nerves listened. Rectangle pupils surrounded in a sea of yellow flood into the room. Not one pair, but several.

“You have stolen from me.”

The voice is terribly beautiful. As it envelops me, it is the voice of a father, an elder, a lover, and a child. Separately, simultaneously. I realized that I want to hear it again, while desperately praying that for it to never find the desire to break silence again. It is awesome. It is horrific.

The orbs shift so slightly forward, different pairs took their turns blinking. They cover the unseen body. They move independently from one another but of the same body. As one pair dance towards me, another flanks. Too far beneath them a maw revealed. A mouth, perhaps, of sharp teeth glistened in the dark. Spittle seeped from the black tongue that flicked between the razors.

“Not only have you stolen time. With it, you created more”.  
  
I clasped my eyes shut, this was just a dream. My first dream in many years of course would be a nightmare. Shortly it would be gone. My hopes would not realize quickly enough, as I heard a slap of flesh, a scraping across my floor. I felt several spots of warm breath hitting my face.

“You haven’t any more time Luke”. The voice ripped into my body. I heard drips fall on the floor. I could only smell the consistent effect of sea water and wet fur. But with each source of breath, slamming against my body blowing my hair around. A hunt of decay, like that of meat that has been left out in the heat, an unfortunate animal baking on the roadside from hours ago. 

My heart is racing towards an unknown goal. I can feel my breathing getting more and more shallow. I can feel my own conscious escaping my brain. A barrage of horns scream and steel clash.  


My useless arm joins its twin as my shoulders force me up.  A command not from my own thoughts. The sounds do not relent, I knew that I was pleading for my body to stop. I knew that something else was quietly, politely even, declining. I felt the furnace of the beasts breathes scorching across my face. My heart pounds much too hard and in a frantic rhythm. Bile coated my throat. The lids of my eyes only just govern my vision. My head looked only forward. My eyes pushed as far as they could to the side of the bed, just barely failing to find their mark.

“There is much atrophy.”

The beast’s conclusion is only slightly decipherable through the noise. As suddenly as it rose, I felt my body thrash back to the bed. My head found its new position, I couldn’t see Katie. Why had she not woken up to free me? I rolled my eyes back and forth looking for the beast. Fear argued with itself as I wasn’t sure I wanted to find it.

The sea slowly fading from the room, the trumpets concluding their play, in the doorway once more, I finally found the collective of wet yellow eyes peering. The mass that they belong to was released.

“Do not prefer delusion to truth, Luke,” only the eyes remain. The terrific, beautiful voice only just yet lost its daunting volume, “I shall yet leave the sea.”


&nbsp;
 

“Luke! Luke Get up!” Katie shouts, shaking me free of my paralyzed state.

I dart my eyes open, my mouth drawing as much air as my lungs will hold.  “Holy shit, Jesus”.

“Its 8:30 Luke, you are going to be late, hurry and get up”. Katie pushes me up to get out of bed. I struggle to return to the monotonousness of reality.  
  
“I, I uh, had a dream. A nightmare actually”. I spewed out in a flurry as I began to get dressed. Katie just made a slightly confused face.  
  
“I thought you didn’t do that?” She said as she threw an article of clothing at me before turning to look at the monitor. “Caroline is still asleep”.

“I don’t. I don’t know what changed”.  
  
“Well, text me when you get to work, I will go get Caroline for breakfast. I love you”. She handed me some socks and headed out the door.  
  
I quickly returned her love and finished dressing. I almost slip on the floor, something wet and viscous remains on my side of the bed. At the time it wasn’t lost on me that it was strange, but I was late for work and rent was a horror that I was much more familiar with.



&nbsp;

 

I enjoy the occasional horror movie. I would like to say that I understand how annoying it is to see a character oblivious to obvious signs of something otherworldly. You will have to forgive my dense reaction to that night. Logic and rationale of a mind conditioned to the norm, are not so easily shaken. Despite what may be the truth, the only thing I wanted to do was find out why I began dreaming again.

A quick appointment with Dr. Elijah, with all the bells and whistles. The claustrophobic inducing voyage into metal monsters and hopefully promising results. In truth, with my experience, I could sleep through the process of these scans. This appointment I decided not to.

As I said brain injuries aren’t something you entirely ignore, you monitor long term effects and make sure nothing has gotten worse over time. This wasn’t such a case, to my surprise, Elijah was almost giddy when he had me indulge him across his walnut desk.

“Well Luke, I must say I rarely have seen something like this,” he put his elbows on the wood to lean forward, his creaking chair accompanied his words.

“You have no signs of ever suffering a head injury. If I hadn’t seen it before, you couldn’t convince me it ever even happened,” he held the papers in one hand as he rolled his shoulders, shaking his head in astonishment.

For all the joy that should have hatched in me, I found a cuckoo of indifference instead. I understood at that moment that it was indeed a blessed thing. Previous fears of not living to see grandchildren, or wishing that I hadn’t lived to forget them, had suddenly abandoned me. But, in the moment of the Doctors revelation, salt and brine filled my mouth and fire kissed my face.

Doctor Elijah smiled, with true glee and authenticity.

1ix1qzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/1zpresso/comments/1ix1qzq/trying_to_find_the_optimal_setting_on_a_kultra/,Trying to find the optimal setting on a K-Ultra for Moka pot,"Even though the suggested range from 1zpresso for a Moka pot is 4.0 to 6.0, some of my most enjoyable cups (using Illy Classico beans) have been at settings of 3.5 or even 3.0. I find when the coffee is as fine as this, it's harder to get rid of clumps/lumps when priming the basket, but obviously I can live with this if the taste is better.

What I'm puzzled by is that at the slightly coarser settings I'm actually finding that not only is the cup less sweet and generally less delicious, but there is more bitterness, contrary to what I'd expect. I've just made a coffee at size 4.0, just to re-check whether that's actually better than the 3.0 or 3.5 I've been using recently, and now have a lingering bitter aftertaste that absolutely isn't there at the finer settings.

Could anyone suggest why this might be and/or share their own experiences with this grinder?

I calibrate it so that 0 is not at the absolute tightest, but rather at the point where the handle can no longer move from a gentle jiggle/gravity (as suggested by 1zpresso in some more recent guides).

I have a sneaking suspicion that the grind size guide (https://1zpresso.coffee/grind-setting/#elementor-toc\_\_heading-anchor-8) for the K-Ultra (which is identical to that for the K-Pro, K-Plus and K-Max) is actually not worth the pixels it appears on, and that there is in fact more difference in burr profile between the K-Ultra and the previous K- models, because I've suspected this before when dialling in my various pourover workflows.",1,1740402911.0,1zpresso,2,1.0,False

She was always disappointed with everything I did for her and was always trying to find problems in our relationship and blame it on me. Then on a random day she was coming back from college and I was at my home and she asked me if I could meet her in a public coffee shop, I already know what was gonna go down, spoiler alert guys: she broke up with me and acted like I was very problematic and wasn’t willing to solve anything but honestly the problems she was talking about were very solvable and I was willing to do anything for her, I genuinely thought I was gonna marry her, but everything ended. 

A few months pass by, I hear from a friend that my ex (that girl) was dating someone from her class while she was dating me. I was like okay that’s a rumour don’t believe what you say. I Confronted her myself at first she didn’t wanna answer like “its none of your business” but after me persuading she told me that it was true. That explained all the ‘unsolvable problems’ we were having. Then I started to move on finally but I still loved her idk why. 

Now it’s been 2 years since our breakup and She’s back with her ex (who leaked her private pictures to his friends while we were dating). I saw his new bf’s story of a note she wrote him while he was flying abroad, it said ‘I have always loved you, I knew you were the one for me’ and some other bullshit with her name in the bottom. 

Now my question is, what do I do guys, my perception of relationships is fucked and I genuinely have turned really COLD with my emotions and don’t feel anything for anybody, I recently started feeling something for someone but she just wants to kiss me, make out with me, have a good time but she doesn’t wanna commit to me even after me being really clear about everything. Before this recent girl there was another girl who wanted the same. Should I just stop searching for someone?, is it a void that I’m tryna fill?, because I want a healthy relationship but I don’t have any hopes right now.

Like some of you, I was also illegally fired almost 2 weeks ago from my fed gov job that I had been at for less than 2 weeks. I moved here from another state for it right after getting my PhD. I was very excited since DC and this job were a dream come true. Since getting fired I’ve been heart broken, depressed, and exhausted. I’ve applied to over 60 jobs since as a scientist (my degree is biomedical sciences) and so far I’m waiting for responses and some are rejections. I moved here with nothing (grad school stipend wasn’t enough to save) and I regret it. No one including myself was expecting this. I wished I was told to wait and they would’ve let me wait before asking me to move here. I was required to be in person once a week. I now have a lease and bills to pay without a job. I have let my landlord know and she’s very understanding. I can afford to live here till end of March without a job then I’d have to move back to my home state or be homeless. I want neither of that and want to give living in DC a fair chance. There is a friend I could stay with but I hate being a burden. 
I’d like to know if anyone knew of any jobs around I could do. It doesn’t have to do with any science (or it could) I don’t have the luxury of being picky right now. If there are any stores, restaurants, coffee shops etc you know of that are actually hiring, please put me on. I have retail and barista experience back in college.  I also babysat all through grad school and have signed up for urbansitter with 1 family now but it’s only 15 hours a week. I also drive so I’ll be signing up to do DoorDash or something.

1ix1lte,https://www.reddit.com/r/ControversialOpinions/comments/1ix1lte/splitting_the_bill_on_dates_makes_them_less/,Splitting the bill on dates makes them less romantic,"I’d like to preface this with saying I’ve never split the bill on a date since like 8th grade. I’m not saying that the guy should pay for the date or the full date very time either. I think every relationship and person has different preferences, some people are more traditional and the guy pays and some people like to switch off who pays. Or even stuff like one person pays for the movie tickets and one person pays for the snacks. Or someone gets dinner and the other person gets dessert. I think it’s all up to preference and people financial situations. I think it’s just the act of splitting up the bill or buying your stuff separately that kills the mood.

BUT I have always felt that splitting was for friends. I’ve dated girls and guys and I’ve never split on an actual date. Last time I dated a girl our first date was Starbucks and I paid for both our drinks, then our next date was a boba date and she paid for both our drinks. Why? Because it was a date and I asked her out. Then she asked me on a 2nd date and she paid for it because it was a date. 

Yeah most dates between a man and a woman the man asks and I think he should pay. If a guy asked me on a date and he didn’t pay for the first date I would probably not go on a second because I just personally feel like it’s not romantic. That’s why I strongly believe in coffee dates or going to smoothie or boba shops. I’m not one of those women who wants to go to a sit down restaurant on a first date ( it helps that I’m 20 so we’re all a lil broke) but like I don’t need a meal out of a person who isn’t my partner like I’d like the budget to be 15$. If someone can’t spend 15$ on a date with me then maybe they shouldn’t be focused on dating right now. Every guy I’ve been with has asked me out first, but as someone who dates women if I ask her I pay period. 

My current boyfriend pays for most of our dates. I always pay on national boyfriend’s day (I know that’s not real it’s just cute) and his birthday. Sometimes I also pay if it’s a casual date or if we’re ordering food then we split it.It just ended up working that way because he makes more money than me and we lean towards traditional gender roles. We’re aware that women splitting expenses equally doesn’t mean that everything in a relative between a man and a woman is equal ( I mean hell women going out with men is even a bigger safety risk, if something happens when we have sex IM the one who gets pregnant and possibly risks my life, I’m the one who remembers important stuff and helps him manage things etc) but that’s because this is how we’ve worked out our relationship. Some people try and make sure it evens out exactly in other ways. All I know though is splitting dates gives me the ick

Or a midol pill. I don't drink coffee, tea, energy drinks, etc.

Yesterday I happened to be insanely tired but had a lot to do, so I just grabbed one of my sister's celcius drinks that has 200mg of caffeine in it - i thought maybe id give it a try. When I was leaving the house my sister literally told me it probably wouldn't benefit me in the long run seeing as I also 'don't drink alcohol or do hard drugs' lol. I drank all of it over like one or two hours. Fast forward like an hour after finishing it, I started to get the most insane brain zaps (as if I was in medication withdrawal) and nausea. I thought surely it was the caffeine, and was researching how it can negatively react with SSRIs (that I am currently on). Anyways, it was pretty manageable until maybe four hours after beginning to drink it, and I started to get insanely hot, my heart was racing, I felt like I was gonna puke, and I had like world-altering crazy anxiety. I literally felt like I was back in my childhood when I didn't know how to cope with anxiety like I do as an adult. I went and crashed on my bed and laid there for like 45 minutes just hyperventilating. It would get a bit better, but the anxiety, sweating, heart racing, etc came in waves for like two hours straight. It was insane, and I was like paralyzed with anxiety. Pool of sweat under me in bed. Keep in mind I'm 20, but my mom had to come sit with me and convince me I wasn't dying and I just needed to let the caffeine get through my system with time. My whole body was shaking, I felt like I was gonna cry but also laugh cuz it was so ridiculous. I ended up having to take a zofran, do breathing exercises to stop hyperventilating, and eventually I fell asleep. Anyways. Has this kind of reaction ever happened to anyone else? I definitely went in too hard with the 200mg and I won't ever be doing it again. I also don't at all mean to be hateful towards caffeine or caffeine users, I wish I wasn't a loser who can't handle a bit of caffeine. Just shook me up a bit! I think I have an anxiety hangover from it today (next morning), my muscles are still kinda buzzing. I also feel kind of dumb, I'm literally in nursing school and taking pharmacology rn and didn't think to start slow with this kinda drug. ",2,1740402453.0,CaffeineFreeLife,2,0.75,False

1ix1kql,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ix1kql/money_really_cant_buy_happiness/,Money really cant buy Happiness.,"I’ve always been a working man. Since middle school, I’ve worked at least a side job after school and on the weekends. When I got out of high school I went to work full time at a factory. Most people loathe manual labor but not me. There is a certain peace in working hard jobs for me. And I’ll just come out and say I'm greedy. I like money. I love it even. Money opens doors and minds. Everyone needs money. With money, you can buy whatever you don’t have. Even friends. Even partners. The saying money can’t buy happiness holds no meaning to me. Or at least it didn’t until last week. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. 

My name is Gabe and I’m 20. Growing up poor and never being able to afford what I wanted from life I started working to buy things. Toys when I was in elementary school. TVs and movies in middle school. Cars and dates with girls in high school. Whatever I wanted I would set a goal to achieve. An amount. Always an amount. With the amount getting higher and higher every purchase I started taking money from anywhere. Do you want to move things out of your grandma’s house that just died, sure don’t mind the jewelry going missing. You want someone beat up doesn’t matter to me but money up front. Once I was out of high school I tried to grow up and walk the straight and narrow after the second chance with my juvenile record being sealed. So I got a factory job and cleaned my life up. But the money wasn’t enough. Rather than go back to less-than-legal means of making money I went for some side work instead. Which puts us exactly one week ago.

 Drinking coffee and scrolling through studies that were close to me on my phone. “Participants wanted for a clinical trial of our new drug Noctenol. Participants will receive $500 base pay and will be entitled to an increasing amount upon the continuation of the trial. The trial will last one week and participants must remain on-site at all times, however, participants reserve the right to leave at any time during the duration of the trial, but cannot return. Witness progress, witness the future with Noctenol.” seeing the base pay and that it could increase I called the supervisor and let him know that I would be using a week of paid vacation. He said that normally such short notice would result in my request being declined but since I had never missed a day of work since I started he said that he would make sure it was approved.

 I called the number at the bottom of the ad and received an automated system. “Atris Pharmaceuticals is the leading pharmaceutical company for behavioral and mental enhancing and healing medicine. Founded by the great Walter Jackson Freeman II on May 31, 1960, the company has become a pillar in the mental health and wellness community. With breakthroughs specifically in…” A young woman answered the phone. “Atris Pharmaceuticals, how may I help you?” the woman asked in a bubbly cheery voice. “Hi, I'm calling about your ad for the clinical trial of Noctenol.” “Oh, splendid!” she responded. “I'll just need your name, approximate weight and height, and age to get started and we can fill the rest out when you get here!” “Gabe, 180 lbs, 6 '5, 20 years old,” I responded. “Ok, hun that'll be all for now. Here is the address at 8:30 on Monday and we'll get started then. Don't just have an amazing day, have an Atris day!”

 The weekend flew by and I arrived at 8:00 and entered the building. Inside looked the same as any doctor's office a TV in the corner chairs in rows magazines on coffee tables and house plants in the corners. The wallpaper was a thick creamy color with brown trim at the bottom. Walking up to a square of plexiglass cut in the wall where the receptionist resided. “Hi, I'm here for the Noctenol trials?” “You're in the right place hun!” She ducked below the desk pulling out a stack of papers. “You'll need to fill these out before we can move forward!” “Thanks,” I said. I grabbed the stack and walked over to one of the chairs in the corner, sat down, and started filling it out. I signed all the general NDAs, waivers of liability, etc.. bringing the paperwork back up to the desk she filed it away and said “Follow me!”

 I followed her to the back room inside were office chairs and a big table with rolling whiteboards along the walls and papers strewn on the desk. “So mister…?” “Gabe. It's Gabe.” “Mister Gabe well go over what the study is about and what you have to do to participate in the trial. So you will be participating in a trial of the new drug Noctenol. Congratulations! Noctenol is a mental enhancement drug that in testing has been found to help control impulses and sudden urges. There are a few minor tweaks that need to be worked out before Noctenol is available for consumers on the open market. You will be in the final phase of testing. You will either be given Noctenol or a placebo. Neither you nor I will know which is which until the conclusion of the trial. To your left are five doors and five rooms each room will double the amount of money starting with $500 for the first room. You have five rooms a day for five days. The total upon completing the five days will be $77,500.” My mouth salivated at the thought of that much money and my mind drifted. “Mister Gabe? Mister Gabe?” “Huh” I asked. “Do you understand the parameters of this clinical trial as I have read them to you?” “ Oh uh, Yes.” “Great do you wish to proceed?” “Yes” “Great please stand and walk through the door to your left!” “Thanks”  “Oh and Mister Gabe!” “Yea?” “Good Luck!”.

LONG RANT !!,"Hello guys, first of all, I am sorry for my English level since it's not my primary language and that might cause some misunderstandings or the overal text being way too long because I am trying to explain everything properly. 

There will be a lot of missing context because I don't want a potential person that will be reading this pass out mid-text out of exhaustion... which might happen anyway since I barely have friends in real life and this is an opportunity to talk this shit out .. (but if you are genuinely super-interested and you will actually read it whole.. i have no problem providing additional details on any questions)

To clear two main things in the beginning, I have been to therapist a couple of times and it did absolutely nothing for me (not that I don't want to get helped.. I am just probably ""too aware"" which hurts and it's really difficult to work with it). And the second one is my personal hobby (which is being a furry) calm down this time please, put down all of your firearm and shotguns... I probably hate the community more than all of you and I barely engage with them anymore. The reason why I am still lowkey ""part of it"" is because I like the craft and idea behind it. People are just the problem and it's something that's out of my control, so please, don't base your opinion on me on stupid people that are the majority of dumbasses that are always way too visible... I totally agree with any resonable negative opinion on the community, so no worries, I am not a weirdo like most of the people there.

Anyway, I am 28, soon to be 29 and I have been single for some time already.. probably more than 5 years.

By single I mean that I barely talked to any women in my area besides my family (sister / mother etc.)

So, why am I creating this post? I rather want to know an opinion from random strangers online than from algoritmic ChatGPT AI chat bots. 

I used to have a perfect relationship (at least in my eyes) that lasted a little over 5 years. It ended because my ex-gf made the decision to leave sice we didn't have enough sex. On one hand, I totally understand that. On the other hand, it was definitely something we could work on together but it was easier to just let go for the other person than trying. Reason behind lack of sex is that she was basically using me as a sex doll because we barely had any other acitivity together. Yes we played some games and went to some conventions (which was amazing). I genuinely felt loved. She used to do a lot of digital artworks, she was drawing every day and I used to play a lot of videogames so in our freetime we could do our thing and while resting we could spend time together. When she was failing her drawing process or experiencing a burn out, she ab<>s<>d me. Not in a sexual way, but she was basically kicking me or punching me. It happend three times but because I loved her, I accepted it and never said a bad thing to her. I knew she was having some issues and I couldn't help her with that. Even though I did later on in the relationship and helped her grow 2 major social platform as Instagram and Twitter. Both above 10k and I was also helping her fix her artworks (regarding 

We broke up, I never heard the reason why we are broking up but after spending some time on the internet and social media, I ""realized"" that she apparently ""doesn't owe me anything"" (yet she took stuff worth of 4000$ when she was moving away, which was a graphic tablet / a lot of stuff / a fursuit etc. and even when she swore that ""she will financially help me if we break up"" because I couldn't keep up with the bills that increased by 50% in the upcoming months flat by myself. Spoiler alert, she didn't).

So, if we move from this breakup which I have no idea to this day which caused it because she never cooked (only once in 5 years), never cleaned (i used to clean moldy plates, yoghurts, bitten of nails, bird poo, a lot of cups etc. around her computer desk and her expensive wacom tablet I bought her). 

In short, I chose her, gave her my all. That doesn't include money. I mean the most genuine love that I can give to someone.

It still hurts after those 5 years. Not going to lie. (I swear, if anyone is trying to ragebait me, just write down ""Well, you need to heal first before dating someone new 🤪"", well, no shit sherlock. I am trying, okay? No one can heal instantly like you John aka self-called emotional uber Terminator, but I am way too soft and love deeply and for real, aight?)

She never acknowledged my hobby as esports player. I was making some money out of it and had bunch of cool friends, twitch streams and I was very known. She hated it. God knows why. I never bothered her with it and I always made time for her. I made everything clear whenever we were practicing with my team or if we had a tournament and I was unavaiable for 4 hours or so. 

I barely date anyone to this day. 

Do I wanna? Who knows. I am too afraid. I got so hurt the last time that I built so many walls around myself that I know I am barely approachable (but I am still though..). 

I had 2 little wannabe relationships. One girl for 4 months, she stole 1000$ from me (literally), so I kicked her out.

And the second one was 5 years younger than me and expected from me (seriously) to pay all the bills, vacation, food, her stuff and then also give her the rest of my income (so i won't be able to buy anything for myself). Yeah we lasted for a month or so...

Where is the problem then? I did everything I think is the solution.

Therapy, gym, taking better care of myself (body/face/smell), fashion, hair/beard, money, job, new hobbies and the online repetitive good old ""focusing on myself and being better"" (iykyk) etc. I am doing this for myself because I want to live a peaceful life and try out new things.

I have noticed one thing on myself. Even though people online literally ""hate"" when a guy says this about himself, but for this one time: I am actually a nice guy. I know this and I am really confident about myself in this way.

____

But here lays the issue. My entire life I have noticed one thing and people (including my family + friends) don't seem to get it.

Whenever I joined elemetary school, using a public transport etc. People seem to avoid me. If there is an empty seat next to me, people won't use it. I mostly eat lunch alone, go to coffee shops alone, sit alone at school... Everytime someone sits next to me, I make super sure upfront that the seat next to me is clean, I don't smell bad, that I don't look grumpy or mad and to be sure none of my clothes or items on the seat next to me. It's always a little gift that makes me smile when some old grandpa sits next to me because I feel like people are not terrified anymore or that I did something good that day...

(Fun fact, one day at 1am when I was coming back in a suit from theater... on a street that is literally infront of my house... a girl was walking towards me and once she was about 50m away from me, she just went into the MIDDLE of a road next to the sidewalk we were sharing so she didn't have to walk past me. You have no idea how pissed I was... So, all men are bad now? Bro I wear a suit and I am lonely af, what do you expect from me. I just want to get home, get high, watch some dumb shit or play games and go to sleep. But yeah I get it. Better be safe than sorry. It's just a fun fact that happend a few months ago).

I don't genuinely think that I am that ugly or that I smell bad (even though people been ""testing"" me lately lmao.. i am convinced that i am so horrendous that even a street dog wouldn't be interested). Sometimes I even ask a long-term friends, if there is something they are not telling me about me.. if it's my face, shape of my face, my nose, my breath, my stupid voice. Nothing. I know friends are always nice but I seriously told them to be honest. They could have lied ... sure. But if they were telling the truth... what's wrong then?

Besides that, my standards when it comes to a relationship are almost... how to say it, non-existing? As long as we have some hobbies in common and she doesn't have a deformed face, smell extremely bad because of some illness or having mental issues as BPD (which was, according to my therapist, issue of my ex of 5 years) or being extremely obese, I don't honestly care at all. She can even live 1000 miles away and I would literslly fly every weekend to see her and spend time with her.

Main thing I wish we could have in common is obviously a furry community BUT, I know guys, I know very well how this thing is. This is really difficult to achieve. It might not be important to you, you might seem it useless and stupid... But if this is my hobby in life, I don't seek a partner that only ""tolerates it"", I just wish for someone that will share my creative passion also.. 

But the community is mostly gay/trans dudes and a little minority are girls (not even talking about the fact that in this ""minority"" vast majority of this minority is taken and proudly having bio's everywhere that go like ""TAKEN 🥰😉"" it's just so demotivating..).

I am also scared / terrified to meet locals in the community on discord / telegram servers because there is a really high chance that I will run into my ex again and she is the type of person that loves to LOWKEY (so it's not that obvious) add salt/lemon to wounds that are even years old (because, why not, right?). Just the thoughts of me seeing here there with someone or getting some messages between the lines only me and her will understand causes me huge anxiety and panic attacks.

_

So yeah, after this chaotic wall of nonsense. I am lost. I also lowkey wanna give up. I have also tried dating apps but anyone nowadays that has IQ higher than a boiling dirt knows that dating apps are useless and only profit developers. 

I have been to clubs, parties, coffee shops, conventions, meetups.. And I barely meet someone. Nobody is interested in any form of communication, chat, 1 on 1 meetups (i don't even know the last time i had serious legit date, that might even be around 9 years). 

Why? I would love to know. For the last year 2023-2025 (not really counting the 25) I feel like I am not deserving of love or a long-lasting relationship. I have been consuming so much social media (tt, ig, fb etc.) which only caused me to be even more depressed. So I uninstalled it. Been in depression spiral for some time so I have some ups and downs. And not having social media at all makes me ""isolated"" even more. My dad passed away due to cancer about 7 months ago so that was another big punch into my mental / physical health and I am spending most of my time with my mom only. 

I have 2 friends I see 2 - 3 times a year at max, colleagues at my new job (that i also barely talk to because we have very rarely something in common), my sister, brother and that's it. 

I learned how to play chess and how to paint/draw digitally because I have trauma from my long relationship and since my ex used to draw a lot and had a lot of wannabe fame (that i helped her with and recently she apparently left social media with 15k followers) and this was the only thing that helped me to stay sane and a bit in touch with something I love dearly.

_

The thing I battle with the most is the standard she set. It's definitely not ""non-achieveable"" but it is a really difficult task anyway. We had so much in common it almost felt like we are related (stop being weird okay.. it was only like this genuine soulmate connection). And to find this in someone again is I N S A N E.

I don't want the same person twice. I just want to feel genuinely loved the same way I love without being scared that my significant other is just with me for sake of not being alone yet she is waiting for someone better the entire time in our relationship... Big plus are some taste in fashion and same hobbies... is it really that bad? Am I really that cooked? I just don't want to settle for mediocrity or super low-standards because I don't want to be alone... I don't actually mind being alone. Just the thought of person that would at least from 30% complete me would be enough..

_

Serious answers that are not generated by ChatGPT and any kind of AI form are more than welcome... I have no idea what do I expect from this but I gotta tell you one last thing.

The hate I carry in myself and bitterness and the sour / salty feeling everytime I see a couple of a seriously interesting cute girl with the most uninteresting below average guy is just crushing me. Dude is just a little bit tiny taller than me, has different hair and that's it. He can be the most shallow person in the world yet he has all the chances and I have to be proving myself every single time above and beyond expectations to even get noticed by someone... I was it was easier. I wish dating apps were less greedy and won't be feeding people delusion of having a ""choice""... it's a sad lonely world I live in. This is my world, yours might be different but for me, it's unfair pain I am trying so bad to deal with but each day I feel like I am doing a bit better, I still recieve some properly aimed (and not possible to dodge) high-kicks and punches... for no reason at all...

_

And last thing of it all... Please, leave out suggestions as ""There are 8 billions people. One day, when you wi least expect it, you will meet love of your life."" or ""Plenty of fish in the sea"". 

Guys, this is not helping nobody plus it's not true at all. Plenty of fish in the sea? Brother, I am not planning to catch all those 8 billions and decide. I am not playing numbers game that I will talk daily to 100 women in one day with hopes that in 10 years one woman will suddenly agree to date me. Wake up.. I am not approaching everyone. I only approach people I am genuinely interested in from the first second I see them. I see absolutely no reason to play this number game. 

Which also causes the problem of rejection. Since I don't live by this mentality of ""talk to as many humans as possible and one will agree to date you with some time"" even though it makes sense, it's barely usable in real life. My ""sea"" is a pond with very special fishes and there are not too many. So in my case, if I run into some of those fishes (which might be once in a year at max) it's highly unlikely that she will be single or agree to a date. Those chances are significantly smaller, you have to admit that. And my standards are already low. I even found a girl that had some serious illness and even she declined our match.

I finally decided to bite the bullet on some proper dark roasted Ethiopia Harrar beans from a local roaster and it just finally clicked. I like dark roasted espresso.

I did a slightly longer ratio 16g -> 35g in about 30 seconds (no pre infusion) and it was just so perfect for me. It was rustic and chocolatey, it had some berry fruity notes  but virtually no acidity and more spicy (?). It was almost like drinking a good bourbon 🥃 it gave a tingly sensation that was pleasant on the tongue without lingering too much.

It might be that the darker roast covers for some skill insufficiency or it could be that it these coffee beans were magical; but that cup of espresso was so good that I almost forgot I had work to go to and I just had to share my experience! 😂🥲",16,1740402305.0,espresso,8,0.9,False

I just bought a new construction home and pretty much got rid of all my previous furniture because it was all about 15 years old and worn out.  I want to start fresh with a new look but I’m having trouble.  I want my house to feel light and airy.  I plan on a palette of warm neutrals such as white, beige, brown, black, etc. with small pops of color thrown in.  I’m waiting on my new couch/sectional to come in for the living room which will be a very light cream color.  I also plan on having a black, round coffee table.  

My floor is not a solid color so a rug is really throwing me off.  Attached is the rug that I ordered off Amazon but I don’t think it looks right so I will likely return it, plus it’s also very thin and my vacuum probably will not do well with it.  Do you think the size (8x10) is Ok for the space?  What color and type of rug do you think will look better?

1ix1jcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ix1jcf/when_would_you_give_up_on_an_ex/,When would you give up on an ex?,"So me 22M and her 23F have been dating for about 2 1/2 years. We had issues in the summer of last year but eventually worked things out. Fast forward to a few weeks ago and she tells me she is being kicked off her uni course. Later that night she breaks up with me. She had been ill in January and I had barely seen her due to work and doing my own uni exams so there has been some issues there. 

Obviously a bit broken after that. But I assumed that she had a lot going on right now and that she probably needed space to fix things in her own life. However she still messaged me maybe not as frequently but still we would talk about uni work etc. This went on for about a week. I asked to meet her and she declined. After this I just sent a message saying I loved her very much but clearly this isn’t the time right to try and sort out issues between ourselves when she has issues of her own that I can’t help with. A few days later she asks how I am. I reply all good hope you’re getting on ok. Then the next day she bombards me with messages when I’m starting to move on with my life without her. She asks why I’m not replying, asking if she should bother with me anymore and if I’m seeing someone else etc. She then says she wants to meet the next day and wants to talk to me. Intrigued and obviously still having feelings for her I agree to this and we meet for coffee.

I ask what’s going on and she replies that she thinks the whole idea of us breaking up is a mistake. The whole you don’t know what you had until you lost it conversation etc. And that she wants to try and work things out by not jumping back into a relationship but wants to see where things go. This sounded agreeable to me. We have some issues that need sorting out but over time and seeing each other I’d either know if it’s right or if it’s not. We haven’t seen each other since she’s been working and I’ve been doing work as well. I sort of touted the idea of meeting this week as we’re both free Tuesday to see if she’d be interested and she said she’s taking things day by day. So not really giving me an answer. 

I’m just curious to what you think is going on inside her head. I’m working on making sure I move on from this a better person, making sure I get my degree finished this year, working out having a great social life etc. I’m happy with the idea of either this is going to work or it’s not. But I don’t want to be stuck in this limbo of not knowing where I stand but ending something prematurely if it could work out. Especially after she told me that she wants me back but isn’t really putting the effort in to go through with it!

Thanks

1ix1jcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1ix1jcc/still_trying_to_find_the_best_grind_size_in_a/,Still trying to find the best grind size in a K-Ultra,"Even though the suggested range from 1zpresso for a Moka pot is 4.0 to 6.0, some of my most enjoyable cups (using Illy Classico beans) have been at settings of 3.5 or even 3.0. I find when the coffee is as fine as this, it's harder to get rid of clumps/lumps when priming the basket, but obviously I can live with this if the taste is better.

What I'm puzzled by is that at the slightly coarser settings I'm actually finding that not only is the cup less sweet and generally less delicious, but there is more bitterness, contrary to what I'd expect. I've just made a coffee at size 4.0, just to re-check whether that's actually better than the 3.0 or 3.5 I've been using recently, and now have a lingering bitter aftertaste that absolutely isn't there at the finer settings.

Could anyone suggest why this might be and/or share their own experiences with this grinder?

I calibrate it so that 0 is not at the absolute tightest, but rather at the point where the handle can no longer move from a gentle jiggle/gravity (as suggested by 1zpresso in some more recent guides).

I have a sneaking suspicion that the grind size guide for the K-Ultra (which is identical to that for the K-Pro, K-Plus and K-Max) is actually not worth the pixels it appears on, and that there is in fact more difference in burr profile between the K-Ultra and the previous K- models, because I've suspected this before when dialling in my various pourover workflows.",4,1740402254.0,mokapot,1,1.0,False

1ix17ow,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChefKnives/comments/1ix17ow/forced_oxidation/,Forced oxidation?,"

I recently bought three high-carbon steel knives, and I have heard of people using things like coffee to force oxidation. I already own a stainless-clad knife with a high-carbon core that I have been using at work, and I have not had any problems with rusting. However, the core is now fully oxidized. My main concern is that having more exposed steel may increase the chance of rust, and I don't always have the time to clean and dry my knife as thoroughly as would be ideal. I may be forced to go from using it to another task for an extended period. I am wondering if dipping it in coffee for forced oxidation could be a quick, effective, and uniform way to help prevent rust.

recently i’ve been hooked onto making tiramisu and the taste is delicious. however my cream is always really runny and cant hold its shape. 
the ingredients i use are:

2 egg yolks
2 egg whites
80g white sugar
250g philadelphia cream cheese (bcuz mascarpone isnt readily available where i live)
1 tsp vanilla essence
cocoa powder
ladyfingers
the directions i follow are:

1. place 2 egg yolks into a bowl and 40g of white sugar. mix until pale yellow and then set aside.
3. place 2 egg whites in a separate bowl and 40g of sugar. mix until white with stiff peaks.
4. add 1 tsp of vanilla extract into the egg yolk mixture and mix slowly.
5. add the soft cream cheese into the egg white mixture and fold it in
6. add the egg yolk mixture into the egg whites and fold in until fully mixed
7. prepare coffee, make sure its chilled.
8. dip the ladyfingers into the coffee quickly and then place into ur dish neatly
9. layer the cream and repeat
10. dust the cocoa powder onto the cake

i dont own an electric mixer so i hand whisk everything but my cream just always seems to be a liquidy texture. ive tried mixing the cheese with cheese on its own and that seems to make a very thick texture but when i mix it in with the egg whites, it just gets really liquidy. i get tiramisoup instead of tiramisu. my friend used the same recipe and hers was successful. 

should i just try a new recipe? could it be the equipment im using? i read somewhere not to whisk the egg whites in a metal bowl or something like that but im not sure… 
please give some advice, i really enjoy making simple desserts 🥲 the tiramisu taste isnt an issue but the consistency is the main factor",2,1740400889.0,bakingfail,2,1.0,False

No matter how much I slept, I’d wake up groggy. Coffee helped for a while, but by the afternoon, I’d crash hard. My metabolism slowed down too—I was gaining weight, and no diet seemed to make a difference.

I figured this was just how life was going to be. But then a friend, who’s big on health and wellness, told me about something called Mitolyn. She said it wasn’t an energy drink or a quick fix, but something that worked at the cellular level to naturally improve energy. I wasn’t convinced, but when I looked into it and saw the research behind mitochondria (our cells' energy powerhouses), I decided to give it a shot.

[Mitolyn Review](https://preview.redd.it/5ezxov6d03le1.png?width=250&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8c0a80fc496e513948f8839bf90bae76f0ca38b)

**Week 1: A Subtle Change**

I started taking Mitolyn every morning, not expecting much. But within a few days, I noticed something—I wasn’t crashing by 2 PM like I usually did. I didn’t feel an artificial jolt of energy, just a steady feeling of being awake and clear-headed. I didn’t reach for my second coffee.

**Week 2: No More Afternoon Slumps**

By the second week, my focus felt sharper, and I wasn’t constantly yawning at work. I even realized I was waking up without hitting snooze five times, something I hadn’t done in years. It felt weirdly effortless.

**Week 3: Unexpected Bonus**

Okay, I wasn’t expecting this—but I noticed my jeans were fitting better. I hadn’t made any major diet changes, yet I felt less bloated and was naturally craving healthier foods. Apparently, Mitolyn supports metabolism too, which explained why I felt lighter and more balanced.

**Week 4: A New Normal**

By the end of the month, I felt like a different person. My energy was steady all day, my brain fog had cleared, and I was moving more without forcing myself. Even my skin looked healthier (I later found out Mitolyn helps combat oxidative stress, which contributes to aging).

**My Takeaway**

I honestly didn’t expect a natural supplement to make such a difference. But after 30 days, I get why people talk about mitochondrial health as a game changer for energy, metabolism, and mental clarity.

Has anyone else tried something for energy that actually worked? Would love to hear your experiences!

I’ve been buying freshly roasted coffee shop-ground beans, but there’s been times when I get home and find out they’re too fine or coarse, wasting around £12 a time. So, I’m considering a grinder to fine-tune myself.

My options: DF 54 (£238) vs. Baratza ESP (£145)—leaning towards the Baratza for the price although heard it’s very noisy.

Would a grinder be worth it, or will I struggle just as often and be better off sticking with shop grinding?

TL;DR: Shop-ground coffee is hit or miss. Should I buy a grinder or save £200 and deal with the occasional bad batch?",1,1740400422.0,espresso,17,1.0,False

When is it required one way or another and when is it permissible to remove them?,"Hello, good people. I am curious if there is a consensus about when you must and must not have shoes on or off, and when you may remove them. I assume this varies by culture and by context. I will offer five examples. In each of these, I am assuming: (a) your feet are clean and not smelly; (b) you are wearing socks and your feet are not bare in any event; and (c) your feet remain more or less underneath your own body, not on a table or protruding into what someone else would reasonably believe to be their space.

1. airplanes: okay to take off shoes at your seat, but important for your own sake to put them on in the aisle or in the bathroom;

2. planes (meaning Amtrak or similar, not subway or similar): same as airplanes;

3. coffee shops: no, absolutely not; feet should be clad at all times;

4. business meetings: same as coffee shop, unless you are at a conference table and can be discreet and nobody observes you have slipped off your footwear for a moment;

5. inside a residence: off, as a rule.

I welcome input. Perhaps others are more strict or lenient, and it could be in either direction. Thank you in advance.",0,1740400417.0,etiquette,6,0.2,False

*Alternative Solution* was well stocked, so ships *Tontine* size and smaller streamed from her down to the Anomura planet to rescue people, render aid, and to build shelters to house and care for survivors. Within three days, the Anomura thanked Four-Forty-Five profusely for her assistance, and gave assurances that they could handle the rest on their own. Lyris was correct - the asteroid had been steered towards the southern hemisphere of the planet and had splashed down in the ocean. It was a disaster, but it wasn’t a catastrophe. 



Four-Forty-Five did wind up speaking to Alia privately about *who* is in charge, and Alia did apologize for countermanding Four-Forty-Five’s orders, but she also pointed out that by her own admission, Twenty-Seven ranks higher as an Original, and… Twenty-Seven was right. Not obliterating the asteroid was the correct call. You can get away with a lot when it turns out you’re correct. Four-Forty-Five pouted for a day, but after that seemed to be fine, and even offered her bed to Alia again. Even without Four-Forty-Five running hot and cold for her, she still felt odd about it and demurred, and had taken to sleeping in one of the spare bedrooms.



While the Anomura rescue progressed, Alia spent time in Four-Forty-Five’s palace - staying out of Four-Forty-Five’s way - and trying to catch up on three thousand years of history. It was… overwhelming. Partly because of the sheer amount of information that she would have to learn, but also partly because she knew that the Eternity would only stock histories that cast them in the best possible light. Alia could only hope to get a broad understanding of things; even in the best of times, she wasn’t a historian. 



It appeared that less than one hundred years after Alia and Greylock set off, her other selves - that had not left on colonial trips - rose up and defeated the Colonial Authority in a coup. From there, they had set up a beachhead in the asteroid belt, and slowly grew their influence, using the vast mineral wealth in the asteroids as their source of funding. 



The records were spotty, but her other selves had settled “a few” worlds during this time, and that gave the Alias in the asteroid belt colonial power as well. They began to be the dominant force in human space outside of the inner planets. It seemed to Alia that a lot was glossed over, but she was beginning to see how “her” empire started shaping up. 



She was in the front room of Four-Forty-Five’s chambers, reading a pad and sipping on a cup of coffee when Yel walked in. “Cap?”



Alia put the pad and the coffee down. She gestured for Yel to sit. “Yes Yel? What do you need?”



Yel sat across from Alia and squirmed slightly. “Uh, so I was talking with Elia and Bric and Ben, and we think… we want to leave.”



“Leave?” Alia’s face tightened, and she carefully threaded her fingers together on her lap. “I was hoping you would come with me on Tontine. You’ve been with me since… since I left Greylock.”



“Yeah, it’s been great - *you’ve* been great.” Yel said quickly, as she reached up and ran her hand through her hair. “It’s just that… the *other* yous haven’t been… what we expected. We kind of want to get while the getting is good. We wouldn’t be leaving you in a lurch!” She said quickly, “You have the rest of the Companions. I’m sure they’ll all be great.”



Alia looked around. Stationed at the doors were guards, and she was sure that there was other monitoring systems all around. She stood and stretched. “Walk with me, Yel.” She said. 



They left the Palace and wandered the gardens. Alia had been exploring whenever she wasn’t reading, and she had found quite a few little nooks she quite liked. She was beginning to come to the realization that she liked so many things here because they were *made* for Alia. She took Yel to a back corner, near a small pond. Darting around the pond where small yellow and orange fish, and there was water plants giving the edge a soft, almost blurred border between land and water. A floral scent filled their noses from another part of the garden. Under a large willow tree was a bench, perfectly set up to observe the pond. Alia sat, and patted the spot next to her. 



Staring at the pond, and not facing Yel, Alia said. “As near as I can tell, this is the most secluded part of the palace. I tried looking for things with my implants, and couldn’t reach anything. It’s possible there are things I don’t know about or can’t access, but, this is as secure as I can make it. What’s really wrong?”



Yel sighed. “Cap- Alia, we’re *worried*. Worried about making a mistake and getting killed, worried about being a target if we’re seen as your favorites, worried about what the future holds with your empire. We were never trained for all this-” Alia could see her make a face through her peripheral vision “-politics. We’re soldiers. The Spear of Humanity, right? See a problem, fix a problem, especially if that problem can be fixed with a rifle.”



Alia opened her mouth to refute Yel, to say something, *anything* to get her and the others to stay, but… she was right. Alia was Alia, she had to do this. She couldn’t ask the same of the others. Her shoulders fell. “Okay Yel. If you want out, you can leave. I’ll give you a ship, a crew, a mission, whatever you want. If you all want to just retire on a planet, we’ll find you the nicest one and make sure you’re set for life. If you want to go start a mercenary corp, I’m sure we can find you work.” Alia turned to Yel, and hugged her. “I’ll miss you, but I can’t make you stay. I have to deal with all this… bullshit because it’s me. It’s unfair for me to ask that of you.”



Yel returned the hug. “Thanks Alia, I knew you’d understand. I’ll talk it over with the others.” She smiled. “I kind of like the idea of starting our own mercenary corp, it might be fun!”



Alia’s smile was thin. “Yeah, fun. I hope it goes well.”



They had returned to the palace and Alia had *just* picked up her pad again when a long tone sounded throughout the palace. All of the guards stiffened, and a runner burst through the doors, approached Alia and genuflected. “Eternity has arrived, Eternity.”



“Oh, the head Alia?” Twenty-Seven said and inwardly smiled when the runner winced. “Eternity is Eternity, *Eternity*. You are all Eternity.”



“She’s just… more Eternity?” Alia said, now not even hiding the smile.



The runner shifted his weight from one foot to the other, and his eyes flicked up to the guards.



“It’s okay.” Alia said, and stood. “You don’t have to answer that. I don’t want you to get in trouble.” She put her hands on her hips and regarded the runner. He was young, though she couldn’t tell how young, with short dark hair and a boyish face. “Why wasn’t the comm used?” Alia said. “It seems inefficient to send a runner.”



“It’s about the look of the thing,” Four-Forty-Five said, as she entered. She was wearing the same uniform that she had when Alia first met her, wreath of silver leaves around her head, and her inner suit for the powered armor. “Remember, Twenty-Seven, it’s not just us, it’s everyone. Protocol matters. Doing it *right* matters.” She inclined her head slightly and looked up towards Alia. “Failure to follow protocol brings chaos.”



Alia’s smile was thin. “I see.” She looked around. “Am I to get dressed up too then?”



Four-Forty-Five smiled widely. “Yes. We have finally been able to procure the proper uniform for an Original. Head to my room, we’ll dress you.”



The same aids that helped her previously were here again, and without being ordered, Alia stood on the platform and put her arms out. This time they were much more gentle with her, and didn’t yank the clothes off. Overhead was a heat lamp even, so she wasn’t chilled as she stood there naked. 



The outfit was… elaborate. There were underclothes, and shapewear that seemed designed to emphasize her breasts and hips. As she was cinched in, she looked at Four-Forty-Five. “What’s this?”



Four-Forty-Five shrugged. “It’s part of the uniform. I think it’s mean to help emphasize your femininity.”



“What? Why?”



“I don’t really know; it’s part of the religion we started with the Mystics. They’d probably say something along the lines of emphasizing your femininity will help the common people see us as the caretakers of humanity.” Four-Forty-Five shook her shoulders and jiggled just once. “Meanwhile *I* think it’s because our previous selves knew that sex sells, and people would be more willing to submit to a leader they were attracted to.”



After the underclothes, came a uniform. It was clearly based on historical military uniforms, white with gold trim with epaulets, and an asymmetric cut. There were boots with a heel that was just this side of impractical. Alia *epaulets* heels, why did her selves wear them as part of the uniform? She noticed that there were zippers that almost disappeared as they were secured, making the uniform look like it was always a part of her, and couldn’t be removed. Lastly, they placed a wreath upon her head like Four-Forty-Fives, but where hers was silver, Alia’s was gold. When she was dressed, she stepped down and spun around for Four-Forty-Five. “How do I look?”



“Eternal.” Four-Forty-Five said, smiling. Alia could have sworn that there was just a hint of a blush on her cheeks. “Come, we must go meet Eternity.”



They took another pod across the gigantic ship, and this time some aides rode inside with Alia and Four-Forty-Five. Alia thought about making conversation, but decided against it. The aides all seemed nervous when she just made eye contact with them, conversation might cause them to panic.



Landing in a wide area that felt to Alia like a cross between a hangar and a piazza they exited the pod, and it smoothly and silently slid up and out of sight. The powered armor that Four-Forty-Five had worn for their first visit was standing a few meters away with people swarming it, checking, polishing, and getting it ready. Four-Forty-Five stepped in, and as it closed around her, she stood in one smooth motion. Alia looked up. “Do I get one?”



Four-Forty-Five’s grin was almost feral. “Of course.” 



From behind Four-Forty-Five’s armor walked another suit, larger and even more elaborate than hers. Alia’s suit had chains and ribbons on the shoulders with even large epaulets, and a massive rifle strapped to her back. Where Four-Forty-Five’s was white with gold trim, hers had much more gold. Even bending on one knee to let Alia climb in, the armor screamed authority. The foot made one place to step, and then she swung her other leg in. As she entered, she could feel the suit forming to her and her implants registered new connections. Her vision improved and she felt the legs and arms of the suit as if they were her own - even down to having a sense of touch. Alia was sure she could pick up an egg, and it wouldn’t crack. *Did the other Alias have implants like mine?* She thought. *This armor can't be operated without implants. I thought Tartarus was unique?* 



As soon as she stood, a group of soldiers - also in segmented polymer armor with opaque helmets - snapped to attention. One group was in the same white as Four-Forty-Fives, and this other group wore the same armored pressure suit, but in gold.



“These are some of your Companions, Eternity.” Four-Forty-Five said. “All of them volunteered for your honor guard.”



Alia regarded them. With their gold suits and opaque helmets she couldn’t see them as anything other than anonymous soldiers, which was the point she supposed. *After this, I need to meet with them, and let them know this isn’t how I’ll be doing things*, she thought. For now though, she had to follow along.



“Come along, Twenty-Seven” Four-Forty-Five said, as she waved with a massive hand. “We have to walk over to Eternity, but she isn’t far. Her Doombringer came up along side ours, and we connected, but she is meeting us here for the official rites.” She smiled. “Don’t worry, all the sanitation and welcome rites have been performed for us. We won’t be breaking any protocol here.”



It was so easy to walk in the armor, Alia marveled. It didn’t feel cumbersome or awkward at all. She was just… walking with Four-Forty-Five. It barely registered that she was two and a half meters tall and weighed a few tonnes. 



After a short walk, they approached another large group of people. They were crowded around a dais in the center, with a large throne in the middle of the dais. As Alia and Four-Forty-Five approached, the crowd parted for them. Alia watched what Four-Forty-Five was doing and tried her best to copy the movements. At the foot of the dais, they both got down on one knee, with the entire crowd - including the Companions - doing the same. 



Sitting on the throne was… well, it was Alia. This one definitely looked older than Twenty-Seven, with a few streaks of grey in her temples. Her hair was longer than Four-Forty-Fives, and was arranged artfully around her shoulders. Internally Alia made a face. That hair looked like it took a long time to get right, and a lot of effort to keep from being one large snarl. Her uniform was much more simple than Alia’s or Four-Forty-Five’s; just a white military uniform, with no gold and seemingly no medals or flourishes of decoration, and Alia was pretty sure she wasn’t wearing shapewear either. Hmm.



“Welcome to my Doombringer, *Alternative Solution*, Eternity.” Four-Forty-Five said, loud enough to be heard by the people closest to her, but not so loud as to be shouting. “I have found and brought before you, Alia Maplebrook Twenty-Seven, one of the Originals; Once Lost, and now Found.” She stepped out of her armor, and Alia did the same, the suits remaining on one knee respectfully.



Alia Maplebrook Five-Eighty-Seven regarded Alia for a moment. She then stood, and walked down from her throne towards her. Alia froze, not knowing what to do, but she was able to notice that her own aides had wide eyes, and they struggled to keep their hands still. What she was doing probably wasn’t normal then.



“Alia.” She said, and smiled. “I’m glad you made it, finally. Tell me, did Four-Forty-Five hit on you?”



Alia gasped as Four-Forty-Five had a coughing fit. Five-Eight-Seven laughed. “I'll take that as a yes. Did you take her up on her offer?”



“Uh, no Eternity, I did not.” Alia said and struggled to figure out where to look. She settled on Five-Eighty-Seven's shoulder.



Five-Eighty-Seven nodded. “Smart. One of Four-Forty-Five’s hobbies is to sleep with us. One day, you should ask her to show you her list. I believe she’s kept a list of her conquests,” she turned to Four-Forty-Five “have you not?”



“Eternity, we can discuss this in the *privacy* of my palace.” Four-Forty-Five said, nearly beet red with embarrassment. “Please.”



“Wait.” Alia said, and looked at Five-Eighty-Seven, “Has she propositioned you?”



Alia Maplebrook Five-Eighty-Seven, Eternity laughed, smiling widely. “Of course she has!” She grasped Alia’s shoulder as Four-Forty-Five tried to bury her head in her hands. “But I think we’ve embarrassed her enough. Let’s go and talk about what to do about you.”

My question is simply, how do I know if I've gone too low in calories & what is a safe level?  
Context: I have been unsuccessfully trying intermittent fasting for several years and failing due to my own struggles with food and not being consistent or binging.  
I started a GLP-1 injection the first week of December and I slid comfortably right into OMAD with no challenge at all. This is the pattern I had worked to do previously, but couldn't maintain. I drink my black coffee and of course water until dinner and even then, my portions are reasonable because I don't feel the urge to binge or reward myself with something that sabotages my success. Everything has been working well and I've lost 35 lbs in just under 3 months and I feel really good.  
My concern is that my appetite is so low that I could eat less than 1,000 calories and feel full but I'm afraid to go that low consistently because I don't want any adverse side effects.  Is there any guidance for this since we aren't eating 3 meals a day, I'm not sure if typical calories per day target still fit.  
  
I got nervous when I was losing 2.5 per week and started eating slight more because I was afraid of losing too quickly. Now I'm wondering if I should just keep doing what I was doing, since it was very comfortable and successful.

I have even got down from having 3 sugars in a tea/coffee to 1! Which is crazy for me as I have been trying to do that for literal years.

I am ordering my next month on the 28th, I am torn because I have felt no nausea or bad side effects on 2.5 and I have lost a lot on it, but I am now struggling with the food noise once again.

“What the *fuck* was that?” Sel said, practically shouting, when they were back in their room. The K’laxi had taken sweets and alcohol - K’laxi can consume alcohol, but the effect isn’t the same as it is with humans - and were now sleepily chatting and playing a complicated card game Nick didn’t recognize.



“What was what Sel?” Eastern said, sitting on the bed. She was still wearing her Empress uniform.



“You know *exactly* what I mean,” She said. “All this Empress bullshit. You know there is *already an Empress* and she wants to kill us.”



“True, but they don’t know that,” Eastern countered, “and now we have some loyal K’laxi to help us.”



“Help us do *what*?” Sel said, narrowing her eyes and pointing her ears.



“Help us to get Empress Raaden off our backs.” Eastern said simply. “Though, that’s not enough. What do you think about going to talk to the Xenni?”



“The *Xenni*?” Sel exclaimed. “You mean the same people who were in a war of *extermination* with us before the humans showed up and pushed them back to their own space? Those Xenni?”



When humanity had met the K’laxi for the first time, they were embroiled in a war that had gone on for more than a decade. The Xenni were attempting to conquer K’laxi space and increase their sphere of influence. The going was slow, and the K’laxi were proving to be a formidable enemy, but the writing was on the wall: the K’laxi were going to lose. 



That is, until humanity showed up with their weapons and star jumpers and wormhole generators. Within six months of entering into an agreement for peace and friendship with the K’laxi, the Xenni were back to their original territory and suing for peace. Since then, relations have been chilly but civil. The Xenni are a carciniform species, and tend to prefer warmer, wetter planets than either the humans or k’laxi so there actually isn’t that much competition for available planets. 



“Yes, Sel, those Xenni. They have had a long time to rebuild their fleet, and with some *convincing* they will be a valuable ally.”



“This is wild, Eastern. First you want to restart a horrible civil war, and now you want to hire *our old enemy* to help you do what? Kill Raaden so you can assume the mantle of Empress? To what end?”



“Maybe we should all slow down and take a breath,” Nick started.



“No. I love you Nick, but we have to talk about this right now.” Selkirk said, and then realizing what she said, her fur rippled back and forth - a K’laxi blush.



“I love you too, Sel.” Nick said, and embraced her. “And *because* I love you and I love Eastern I want us to work this out. You and her are practically shouting at each other now. I’m worried that either of you are going to say something that you’ll regret. Why don’t we have a cup of tea, relax, and go to bed. Tink? Can you send the K’laxi back to their ship with a promise of more planning tomorrow?”



“Sure thing Nick.”



As soon as Tink disconnected, Selkirk launched herself onto Eastern and started kissing her, pulling at her clothes, trying to get them off. Eastern helped by undoing buttons and zippers almost as fast as Sel was pawing at them. “Get over here.” Selkirk said to Nick, around a mouthful go Eastern’s shoulder.   



After, they were all laying in bed, naked and panting. Selkirk lifted herself on her elbows and looked at both of them. “I love you, both of you. This is why I’m so upset, Eastern. I feel like it’s the Nanites talking, not you.”



“Oh Sel.” Eastern said, and pulled Sel’s head onto her chest. She started stroking her fur gently. “I would be lying if I said this wasn’t the Nanites idea at all. But, what they’re saying does have some merit.”



“What *are* they telling you, Eastern?” Nick said as he snuggled up against both of them.



“They point out that Raaden won’t leave us alone, not while she thinks of me as a threat. The AIs won’t help us because they think of us as a threat.” She looked at both of them. “What if we *became* a threat?”



“What do you mean?” Sel said.  



“We just want to be left alone, but ever since Jameson gave this… *this* to me, we can’t be. No matter what, someone is going to want this power I have. Either to use it for themselves or to destroy us so we can’t use it against them. It’s time to stop being reactive. We need to be proactive.”



“And do what? Attack Raaden?” Nick said. “She’s the richest person in Sol, and has the same Nanites you do. We can’t show up with Tink and a dozen K’laxi ships and expect anything other than our total destruction. And, if we showed up with Tink, the K’laxi and the Xenni, it would be seen as an act of war against all of humanity. The colonies would join with Sol, and everyone would gang up on us and kill us.”



Eastern nodded. “Yes, they would.”



*<You can defeat them.>*



“So, then what?” Sel said, and put her head back onto Eastern’s breast.



“We don’t attack all of Sol with a whole fleet. We go in, the three of us, with Tink’s help if he wants, and we… take care of her.”



*<Quick and surgical. Take over her whole operation. Exchange one Empress for another. Most people won’t even notice, let alone care.>*



“Eastern, Nick is a small time crook, and I’m a fence who also works for the K’laxi secret police. None of us are assassins.”



*<You don’t need to be. We will help you.>*



“You’re telling me the Discoverers have never removed someone that they felt was a threat?” Eastern said, raising an eyebrow.



“I mean, sure.” Sel admitted. “But-”



“It’s the same thing.” She said. “We know where she is, we know what she looks like, we know how she operates. We go in, get rid of her, and get out.”



“We don’t know *worshiping* of that” Nick said.



“Then it’s up to us to go back and find out.” Eastern said, firmly. “Come on, this? Tracking someone down? That’s what we were hired to do originally. Let’s go back to what we’re good at.”



“What about my Uncle and his Empress worshiping friends?” Sel said, tensing as she said it.



“We-el, they’re going against the status quo, right Sel?” Eastern said.



“Yes, the anti-Empress faction won, handily. Worshiping the Empress is nearly forbidden now.”



“And you’re in the Mel’itim, who have a stated goal of helping K’laxi everywhere, right?”



“Yes… we do.” She said, realization dawning. “You think I should turn my own Uncle - the head of my familial line - over to the Mel’itim?”



“If not turn him over, then at least let your bosses know that there’s a faction of K’laxi in the military that are still loyal to the Empress.”



Sel sat up, her ears flat. “I don’t like it. Uncle En-Vas is a blowhard, and I’m pretty sure had my biological parents killed, but…” She shook her head. “K’laxi families are complicated.”



“You don’t have to turn your uncle in,” Nick said gently. “You could just mention that you came across of captains who were toasting the Empress and speaking highly of her, don’t even mention names. If they ask, give the names of the other captains.”



*<If giving them over to authorities is what gets Selkirk onboard, then it is worth the sacrifice. She is more important than a few bloviating K’laxi.>*



“Or,” Eastern said. “Do nothing. Let them go, and continue to think their Empress will return someday. We can link back to Sol and do our work and never say anything to anyone.”



Sel got untangled from Nick and Eastern and snuggled under the huge comforter on the bed. “I don’t know.” She said, and yawned hugely, exposing her long sharp teeth. “Let me sleep on it, I’m exhausted.”



The next morning the K’laxi and their ships were gone. “They went out ‘on patrol’” Tink said, as they padded into the lounge. “I don’t know if they’re coming back or not, but we shouldn’t stay in this location much longer.”



“Tink, how much of what we talked about last night did you hear?” Nick asked.



“I mean, when I notice that you three are… doing biological things I mute the room.”



“You mean sex?” Eastern said. “I never would have thought you would be a prude.”



“Yeah, and anyway, Sunny said you’d do anything for a pretty girl.” Selkirk added.



“Hah, that sounds like something Sunny would say. It’s not the *activity*,” Tink said, “It’s the *sounds*. I can’t stand the noises you three make when you’re going at it. Ugh. Too many fluids too… squelchy.”



Nick grinned at the description. “I mean, the sounds are part of the fun.”



“For *you* maybe. I can’t stand them. Anyway, no I left your room muted most of the night. I’ve made the mistake of un-muting those mics and then you went at it *again* a few hours later. Sheesh.” Nick thought he heard Tink smiling as he spoke, but he was sure that he was telling the truth. “Why? What’s up?”



Eastern sighed. “We are being too reactive. We can’t just keep running forever, until Raaden or the AIs or both, or something worse catches up to us. We need to go back.”



“Back to Hyacinth?” Tink said.



“Back to Sol.” Sel said. “We need to confront Raaden and… eliminate her. It’s the only way we can get any peace.”



“What about your Uncle and his friends?”



“I’m going to let them play at Empress worship… for now.” She said. “When this is all done and we’re sure she’s gone, I’ll report him to the Mel’itim.” Eastern smiled at Sel when she said that. 



“We’re asking Tink, because we can’t get back to Sol on our own, and we know that AIs aren’t… the most popular back there right now. If you wanted to drop us off at Parvati and we make our own way back, we’d be fine with that.”



“Eastern, I’m hurt you would even suggest that. I thought we were a team. A crew and their ship.” Tink said, his voice falling.



“Oh Tink!” Selkirk jumped up from the table and hugged one of Tink’s support frames. “We see you that way too, we just didn’t know what you thought of us!”



“We’re in this together.” Tink said. “I’ll help you three out until whatever you need to do is done.”



“Okay.” Nick said and drained his coffee. “How do we find and eliminate an Empress who can give commands that can’t be disobeyed, and is the richest person in Sol?”



“Well, for one, you *also* have someone that can give commands that can’t be disobeyed. You should leverage that more.” Tink said.



“I don’t like the idea of that.” Selkirk said as she toyed with her breakfast. “It’s a slippery slope.”



“Perhaps.” Tink admitted. “But, there will come some times when you’ll have to do it. Better to be prepared to do it and ready to deal with the consequences ahead of time, so you’ll do it without hesitation.”



“We don’t have to worry about that now.” Eastern said. “For now, let’s work on getting back to Sol, and getting back on Hyacinth. I think that’s a good start for trying to find Raaden.”

I don't pay a ton of attention to it, I get distracted and impatient, and I often make ""well, I'm gonna die by doing this"" YOLO decisions.

I'm slowly getting better by gradually shifting away from that playstyle. You can see it in my overall versus recent winrate (45,5% total to 49,03% over the last 1000 games, and a 53% over the last 224 games). The issues are still around though. If I stopped the carelessness, stopped starting games by pressing RRR and reading an academic philosophy paper while waiting for my tank to move, or if I stopped having picture-in-picture youtube videos as I play the game, or hell, if I drank some coffee as my ADHD meds wear off and I actually invested some cognitive effort into the game, I'd do a lot better. I know all of that, I know how to (mostly, it's still a learning curve) eliminate the 0 damage, shit performance games from my record. Because those are disproportionately bringing down the average. If you take those out of the equation, my stats would skyrocket.

I've been getting a really damn good win rate in my Char Futur 4, though my WN8 is still pretty bad in comparison (1221 WN8 to a 57,4% win rate, 60,4% over the last 101 games). My survival rate is at around 33% with this tank, which is partially me being aggressive in the late game, but mostly just impatience and careless decision making in the early game. I know it could be better.

But then I have games like this.

Where I absolutely demolish. I made some questionable decisions that I think worked out for the best, like going city to start before backtracking to snipe. I didn't go in to a closer range to help with the eastern assault, because I would have died. I was doing damage at a distance, and I'm in an autoloader. I decided to back off and keep myself alive as long as possible - I've found ""stay alive at all costs"" to be the most effective strategy rather than dying to save teammates who will usually just suicide right afterwards anyway.

I'm sure a unicum player could have won this game, but my question is: how? Especially in the later stages of the game, not as much in the beginning. I have great spotting stats, but if I'd run in to cover cap without getting rid of those tanks first, I'm fairly sure I would have been spotted, flanked, and killed. Even had I managed to reset, I would have revealed my position while surrounded by an enemy that could keep up with me and kill me while I'm reloading.

I know what I need to do to fix the horrible games, and I'm working on that. But in situations like these, this isn't a matter of me not paying attention or treating the game too casually. This is just a flat-out lack of knowledge and skill. And this question pops up in a number of games, regardless of my performance. Most of the time, I can trace the cause, but sometimes I just don't know what I ought to have done.

I'd love the advice from some decent players.",5,1740399664.0,WorldofTanks,4,1.0,False

1ix0p1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1ix0p1h/42lbs_down_in_7_months_observations_and_advice/,42lbs down in 7 months - observations and advice,"Hi all, long time lurker but first time poster. Sharing my story so far in hopes it helps others! 

——————-

As the title says, I’ve lost 40lbs (3 stone) in the last 7 months, and therefore I just wanted to share some of my observations and learnings in hope they may help others. This post may end up a little lengthy but I’ll try to keep things as concise as I can.

___Background / context___

For context I’m 36, F, 5.2”. SW in July 24 was 218lbs+ and current weight is 176lbs, total lost 42lbs. I have been “overweight” since my early teens. In college (age 17-18) I was around 150lbs and in my early 20s I was around 160lbs. Around the age of 24/25 my weight had increased significantly to around 200lbs and I decided I had to do something about it, so I set about “eating healthy”and using meal replacement shakes,  started to exercise and I lost about 30lbs. After around 4-5 months I slipped back to old ways and gradually gained the weight back. Once again around age 32 I decided I had to lose weight and so this time I tried the Keto diet as I had heard good things about it for quick weight loss - I stuck to it for around 4-5 months again, lost 20lbs and then again fell back into old ways. Weight piled back on due to depression, PCOS and a myriad of excuses I made for myself. Fast forward to July 24, 218lbs+ I was 36, living with chronic pain, poor mobility, terrible anxiety and despised myself. I decided enough was enough.

___How I’ve lost the weight___

Very simply, CICO and eating in a deficit as well as eating Keto. After the short lived success I had with Keto a few years ago, and the memory of how good I had felt whilst doing it, I decided to try again - however (most importantly) this time I took the time to properly educate myself around Keto, diet, nutrition and what actually goes into our food and why it matters! With all the aches, pains and generally poor quality of life I was experiencing, I made the decision that this is a “lifestyle” and not a diet or a means to lose weight - this isn’t for vanity, it’s for health.

I lost the first 20lbs between July and September 24, strictly through diet. In general I started moving more and I became much less lazy. I didn’t incorporate any exercise until January this year however. I now go to the gym focussing on strength training 3 times a week, now increasing to 4 times a week with a focus on compound exercises and progress overload. I don’t do any cardio, I get around 5k steps a day currently and plan to start trying for 8-10k as I now have a walking pad at home. I’m absolutely far from perfect and have occasional days where I don’t eat Keto, or eat over my calorie goal but the next day I just get back to it. I still plan to lose another 20 - 30 lbs, the weight loss has dramatically slowed down over the last 2 months and I’ve only lost 2lbs since the start of January but I can see and feel changes in my body. My goal is to lose around 10lbs+ by July this year.

___Observations and advice____

- Do not treat your weight as a vanity only issue, it’s so incredibly important to take care of your health first and foremost and let the appearance changes from weight loss be a bonus! I truly believe coming to this realisation has helped me come as far as I have on my journey and still have motivation and desire to continue. 
- Being healthy is hard. There’s going to be so many days where you feel like quitting because it’s hard, very hard. But so is being unhealthy, pick your hard and make the choice that is going to overall improve your quality of life.
- Educate yourself. Read up on what you’re eating, understand what goes into your body and why this is important, I truly can’t stress this enough! Can you lose weight while still eating junk food? Yes! But should you? Ideally not…this isn’t intended as a lecture but hopefully an eye opener to people who (like me until recently) had very little awareness of this issue. I would recommend anybody who hasn’t done so to go and read Ultra Processed People by Chris van Tulleken - this book alone helped me to completely change my attitude towards food. Now I can look at a cookie, understand what it contains and how it impacts my body and make an educated decision on if I want to eat it (sometimes I do and that’s ok!).
- Treat the changes you make as a lifestyle. This change in mindset did wonders for me personally as it allows me breathing room for days where I may eat over my calorie goal, I might eat none-Keto because it’s a friend’s birthday or I’m sick and desperately want some comfort food! These days are ok, as long as they’re a rarity! Nobody is perfect and you don’t need to be, you just need to be consistent. I aim for a 80/20 approach and have found this works so well for me. 80% of the food I eat is whole food, with very few ingredients and the other 20% is things like sugar free coffee syrup, seasoned pork rinds and foods that I know have been processed. I also follow the 80/20 guide for my general diet when it comes to eating within my calorie goal or eating Keto. There is no finish line here, so allow yourself to live life while making good choices, most of the time!
- Take LOTS of progress pictures. It’s going to be very difficult to see the difference some days and you will need these pictures to remind you of how far you have come and why you are on your journey. 
- Be patient and treat yourself with kindness and respect. It’s extremely easy to compare yourself to others, or be your own worst critic (I speak from experience) but please be kind to yourself! Losing weight is physically and mentally extremely difficult and looks differently for everybody - take the time to reflect on positive changes you have made and in how you feel and no matter how slowly, just keep going.
- Preparation matters. I’m not saying you have to prep your meals for the week or plan a month in advance, but simple things like making sure there’s something on hand you can grab if hungry that will stop you making a negative choice will make a big difference in the long run. I don’t personally meal prep but I do like to have a general idea of what I have in the cupboard/fridge so I know “when I get home from work I have some chicken breast to cook for dinner”. The chances are if I got home to an empty fridge, tired and hungry, I’ll be on Uber Eats!
- Stop treating food as a reward. I’m a recovering emotional eater, and food to me has always been a pleasure, and always will be - I love food and I enjoy eating. That said, food is an energy source for our bodies, it is not a reward or something to be used for comfort. This is a harsh statement but I believe a necessary mindset and understanding to have. You can absolutely enjoy food and you should, but please learn to treat it for what it is - energy for your body. Food addiction is real and you can overcome it through educating yourself. 

I’m sure there’s a lot more I can add to the list but these are the major things that have helped me. I’m more than happy to answer any questions if there are any and I genuinely hope this helps at least one person.

———————————
TLDR:
Lost 42lbs in 7 months with eating in a deficit on Keto. Treating this as a lifestyle not a quick win diet. Educate yourself about food, what goes in it and why this is important. Be kind to yourself, be patient - it takes hard work but it’s worth it.",7,1740399456.0,WeightLossAdvice,0,0.89,False
1ix0or5,https://i.redd.it/torda2y1x2le1.jpeg,My Headcanons/ My Alternate Timeline of River Republic,"(WARNING: These headcanons can be more considered ""alternate timeline"" than imaginating being canon to the current EAW lore. Its not entirely intended to fully make sense with the creators' intentions, despite following the EAW timeline in Wiki GG)

- Nova gets easily drunk after two cups of coffee

- River has a habit of biting pens (her trademark object) when too focused

- Nova is 32 and River is 42

- Nova joined the main party in May 1003 after being in communist youth club and the provincial communist party branch of the Industrial Rijekograd. Joined parliament in March 1004 to replace a deputy and got quickly voted as party leader in November/December 1004 after being the only one that managed to get under River's skin (The start of a rivalry)

- Before Nova, the Communist Party was between 10% and 17% of popularity in a stagnation era.

- The Communist Party was initially formed as a progressive party called Red River after its founder Fountain Marvel was shunned by the harmony party and split from it in 970

- It got a surge of popularity until 982 after 
the snap election of 971, the elections of 975 and 979 and the snap election of 981 where the party managed to get support enough for the harmonist party to need the Red River to tolerate their government, which lead to Fountain officially embrace the communist ideas he grew inspired in 980 due to similar ideas to his party, renaming to the Communist League. Then, in 982, Fountain dies due to an accident

- The Communist Party falls appart after the vice-general secretary and ultra-hardiner Cake Bloom took over and destroyed the toleration agreement with the harmonist party by refusing to negotiate which punished a lot in the snap election of 982, with Cake ousted after everyone in the party openly shunning him and interim leader announcing quick leadership elections.

- Despite another snap elections in 985, the Communist League had a hard time to get the same revelance in the Golden Era of Fountain, with the hardliners, despite shunning the ultra hardliner Cake, having reputation damaged

- Caramel Maze surged in popularity in 1002 as the biggest face in the hardliner faction, presenting as an anti-revisionist. However, in secret, he's a ultra hardliner anti-revisionist like Cake, only disliking Cake due to Cake being idiot for sticking with democracy rather than revolution

- Nova planned to run for party leadership and Sabor Elections of 1005 with Tara Steam, hardliner too but also a best friend that colaborated tightly with Nova. However, the majority of the hardliners faction forced Nova to have Caramel as running mate to get their support.

- River had joined the harmonist party in 997 but her main job was being a teacher until she got convinced to run for leadership elections in 999 where, thanls to her charisma and refreshing ideas for the harmonist party lead to her becoming chancellor in 1001

- River's first vice-chancellor had left after a year due to health complications, leading to River appoint Hector Vippazin, Field Marshal and Uncle (and father figure) of River. Nepotism accusations avoided due to Hector being part of previous governments.

- River's parents died when River was 3, leading to Hector take care of her at the age of 25, with his girlfriend later wife, due to being River's guardian.

- Despite being 64 years old, Hector has a sharp mind. And, despite River being 42, Hector still calls her his ""kid"".

- Harmony Party is normally in coalition with Liberal and Progressive parties. It used to also ally with conservative parties but River, not being a fan of them, barely negotiated much with them and shunned any conservative party in her coalition in th 1005 elections

- River Republic has been the leader country of the River Coalition since the start of the coalition, winning constantly in the coalition leadership. There were brief periods where the country wasnt leader with Bakaran Republic, Wittenland and Lake City having their time to shine
