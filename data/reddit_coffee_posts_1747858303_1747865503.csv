1ksah0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ksah0p/aitah_for_telling_my_best_friend_i_hope_she_never/,AITAH for telling my best friend I hope she never opens her own café?,"I’m 27F. I’ve run a small coffee shop for the last two years, and it’s been a dream come true. My best friend Mia (32F) not the real name, has always wanted to open her own café but hasn’t been able to get it off the ground for various reasons, mainly money and some bad timing.

I used to feel bad for her. While I got my shop up and running, she was dealing with failed business loans and a few personal setbacks. She’s told me before that it stings to see me succeed when it’s what she’s always wanted, and I understood that.

Recently, I had to go out of town for a family emergency. I trusted Mia to watch over the shop for two days. She’s worked with me before and knows how things run. I left everything in good order, labeled stock, clear instructions, and told her just to keep things simple until I got back.

when I came back, it's total chaos.

Equipment was broken, shelves were emptied, ingredients gone. My POS system was tampered with. She said it was a crazy two days and claimed she had some friends over to help. But it looked more like she threw a party in my business. Security footage later confirmed it, her friends drinking behind the counter, trying to make custom recipes and messing around with machines.

Thousands of dollars worth of damage. I confronted her, and she brushed it off like it wasn’t a big deal. No apology, no offer to help fix it.

I snapped. I told her to get out and never come near my business again. I said, I hope you never open your own café, because if this is how you treat someone else’s, you don’t deserve one. I also told her if she ever does, I’d make sure people know how careless she was with mine.

friends and even my sister are saying I went too far. That Mia was just trying to help. That she’s been through a lot and I should be more understanding.

But I’m the one left with thousands in damages and weeks of cleanup. So, AITAH?",1,1747864877.0,AITAH,8,0.6,False
1ksaf0g,https://i.redd.it/4mexzyi8j72f1.jpeg,Gave my crush a leather Ditto card wallet and got ghosted...,"So I’ve had a thing for this girl for a while and I wanted to get her something small and thoughtful. We both love Pokemon, and she’s obsessed with Ditto. Some of you might have seen my previous post about a Gengar card holder that I had custom made and I received so much love to show it off!! So I thought I should also order one for her! I got it, put it into a cool hand made box I made.

She seemed to really like it when I gave it to her. She said it was cute, smiled and even said this was really thoughtful!!

Few days later she completely stopped talking to me. No texts throughout the day. We had plans to meet up for coffee and I was ghosted in person and on text. At first I thought I might’ve just misread everything… but than a mutual friend told me she’s vegan and apparently pretty upset after realizing the wallet was real leather. I didn't know!

Now I feel awful. I'm losing sleep over this and I'm not sure what to do. I genuinely didn’t know she was vegan, and I really wasn’t trying to be disrespectful. I just thought it was a cool gift she’d like...

Did I mess this up completely to even be friends? Is there anything I can do to make it right? She won't talk to me..sigh......:(",23,1747864744.0,pokemon,5,0.96,False

1ksadan,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ksadan,Climate Cafe South Brooklyn created through the Marine Park Young Adults Association,"We’re excited to introduce Climate Cafe South Brooklyn, a new community initiative run through the Marine Park Young Adults Association!

The Marine Park Young Adults Association is a community-driven social group for young adults ages 18–35 in southern Brooklyn that has registered as a nonprofit with the State and will soon be filing as a 501(c)(7) non-charitable nonprofit. Our mission is to create spaces where young people can make meaningful connections through fun events, creative activities, and impactful community service projects. From movie nights and murder mystery parties to concerts and volunteer work, we’re all about bringing people together and giving back.

Climate Cafe South Brooklyn builds on that mission—offering a relaxed, welcoming space for everyone, regardless of age, to come together and talk about climate change in a supportive, non-judgmental environment. It’s not a lecture or a seminar—it’s a conversation. Whether you’re feeling anxious, inspired, confused, or just curious, you’re welcome.

Our first Climate Cafe is happening Saturday, June 7th at Marine Park Coffee at 1 PM. Come join us, grab a drink, and take part in a community that cares deeply about people and the planet.

Feel free to connect with us on Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/climatecafesouthbrooklyn!

Please let us know if you would like to be a speaker for a future Climate Cafe as we need scientists, climate informed therapists, and other professionals to speak on the climate crisis, and please let us know if you have any ideas for places we could have Climate Cafes in the future as we would like to start meeting in other neighborhoods in southern and central Brooklyn!",1,1747864616.0,Canarsie,0,1.0,False

Pt17

“Hey there, how are you feeling now? I hear you had a bit of a rough time of it” said Reggie to Y’vre, a concerned tone in his voice as he looked at the wrapping around the stump where the young pilot’s arm used to be. 

Y’vre shifted slightly, his slender frame making him look almost child like in the Med bay bed “I may have made an error in judgement” he admitted sadly “I wanted to ensure we would be ready for departure and do all the checks, being the last remaining bridge crew that was conscious. I discharged myself early and this led to my current predicament” he gestured vaguely at his stump. 

“You did what you thought was right, no matter how ill advised it was for you to do it, especially without accompaniment. It would be heartless to chastise you for placing the welfare of the others on ship and trying to ensure that the she was safe and ready, you've already paid your price young one” replied Dorian in a kind voice, clearly touched by the young Sarlan’s dedication and bravery. 

“Tell that to the Head Medic, she's been biting my head off for hours” chuckled Y’vre, then his smile turned sour as he said “She did say that I wouldn't be able to get a cybernetic one until we stop at a proper facility though, so I won't be able to fly us anywhere”. 

Little did the others know that Jamie had also been touched by the lads actions, hearing the boys explanation of the current state of affairs he said “You've been brave, just show me what to do” taking Reggie and Dorian a little by surprise that he'd offered his skills so readily, especially considering that he'd been so reticent no more than half a cycle ago. 

Y’vre looked dubiously at the hairy mountain of a man, his face, neck and arms strewn with scars, some of them still fresh after the altercation with the ex-Captain “I'm not sure that you quite understand-”. 

Reggie cut him off “This man was once a pilot too, he flew in the war. Don't be too quick to judge him based on appearances, he'll no doubt be rusty but still a hell of a lot better than the alternative” he chuckled, glancing at Dorian who was serenely puffing out clouds of pink mist, who also laughed at that last point. 

“Uh… right, sorry sir” said Y’vre, looking down momentarily, showing respect. “May I ask when it is we'll be making headway? As I'm eager to be of use” as he said this, shifting more upright in his bed, his eyes full of youthful enthusiasm. This prompted a dark look from the medics and the pilot quickly settled down again. 

Reggie sighed “Not for a while, you have time to get yourself healed up. We have to wait for an inspection from the Control of Contagious Diseases team which could take anywhere between a few hours and a few weeks. But hopefully, with the threat level being so high and our limited resources, we are prioritised” and with that the young pilot seemed to relax a little. 

“Please don't hesitate to let me know if I am needed though Sir” he said, a little deflated “I could run the human pilot through some simulations to get him prepped”. 

“An excellent idea, for now though get your rest, we'll chat again soon” said Reggie and with that the three left the Med bay. 

As they headed out the door Ju'ut caught up with them, jogging and asked “are you headed for the mess hall? I'd like to come with you if that's the case” she seemed to have gained a nervous energy over the last day, probably due to too many cycles without proper food or sleep. 

“Yes, a great idea! Let's all head to the mess hall, I'm craving something and was going to try one of your ‘coffees’ that smelled so good earlier” said Dorian, the Ox he'd been puffing on clearly making him more alert, more eloquent than before. What a weird effect for a pipe of something to have, thought Jamie idly. 

As they headed to the mess hall, the four chatted about their respective days and roles during the fighting, Jamie preferring to allow Reggie to do most of the talking. He was still so unused to being around people, he couldn't help but check out of the conversation and daydream about the world he'd been on. 

487-B designated as an immature world, insignificant to the council, but not to Jamie. He remembered the real 487-B, waking up every day to and orange sky and the steady wind bringing a sweet smell on the breeze that unnerved him at first but now signalled home. The plains full of undulating creatures, the sharp hills filled with avians, his small encampment surrounded by thick knurled tree-like plants that rose almost ruler straight into the sky. The struggle of daily life, killing his dinner and making enough food to keep him alive, then somehow having a little too much. Then his mind returned to Day Day, how he found the poor beast as an abandoned hatchling, raised and taught them how to hunt until eventually they were strong enough to leave. But they never did, I did, thought Jamie as a tear ran down his cheek and he hastily wiped it away. 

Reggie noticed but said nothing, he continued to chat but pointed out a new meal on the menu to keep Jamie's dignity intact. “What in the hell is putanesca?!” he said loudly, capturing the attention of the chef. 

“It's essentially what we have left until we get our supplies” sighed the chef, he'd had enough of these questions today and it was plainly evident on his face. 

“Oh well, guess we're all trying it!” he said brightly, adding “I can assure all of you that I've had worse” with a laugh. 

As they all got their plates they found a table and sat down, the ambience of the mess hall a hubbub around them, snatches of conversation floating over to them amongst the noise. Most of it concerning the recent parasite infection, debating the safety of being on ship after, but occasionally bits of chatter regarding Jamie could be heard cut through the conversation. 

Jamie had clearly noticed and seemed uncomfortable, after all, this was his first time in the mess hall since he'd been picked up, so he was already tense. Ju'ut noticed this and caught his eye gently reassuring him “They're just nervous, a lot has happened and you've been at the centre of most of it. They know what you managed to do for us though, just give them time”. 

Jamie appreciated her kindness and nodded, punctuating it with a gruff “Thanks” between mouthfuls. The meal was nothing remarkable, but it was edible, essentially a clumsy mess of the last of the fresh ingredients, chunks of standard ration block to top it up with nutrients and a sauce drizzled over it. The only saving grace was that the various races had only two main differences nutritionally so they wouldn't be short of rations for a while at least. Something like that was always a concern on a medium sized Sarlan ship like the one they were currently on. 

As they finished their meals the four of them chatting and exchanging accounts of the last couple of days, they began to stand and head for the door before the chatter turned back to work. Reggie motioned for the rest to follow him as he headed out saying “Ju'ut, I'm sure you have more pressing matters to attend” with a slight bow “But I figure us three should at least get acquainted with the bridge controls if we are to stand any chance of getting to our next stop” with a questioning look on his face, almost seeking the other two's approval of his plan. 

Jamie realised he hadn't actually been in to the bridge, the last time he was there he was in the corridor outside it and a little preoccupied. “Sure” he said “why not?” in his gruff way. 

“I'm more than happy to go my dude” said Dorian, a little slower than normal, before he pulled out his pipe and took a deep drag, expelling a veritable cloud of pink mist that give Jamie a head rush. “Sorry, got carried away chatting and forgot to top up so I'm a little heady” he laughed, in a low and slow voice. 

“Let's head up there now then” said Reggie, setting off. As they Reggie and Ju'ut chatted while Dorian and Jamie walked behind barely speaking a word, they eventually reached a point where Ju'ut peeled away waving goodbye and they continued towards the bridge, reaching it in a matter of minutes. 

Jamie and Reggie couldn't believe the job the technicians had done on the corridor, it looked almost the same as it had before the fight, it was remarkable, but the scars of the battle were still evident in places here and there. A welded sheet here and a bent beam there, but to the untrained eye you would be hard pressed to tell. As they approached the door Reggie communicated with security to open it, to be greeted with several angry technicians with equipment, tools and spare parts strewn all over the floor and surfaces. 

“Why are you here Sirs, I haven't given you the update that we are ready to fly yet, this area is still unsafe” huffed what was obviously the Grrzen supervisor “If you get injured it's more than my carapace is worth. Please do not enter, even humans would get hurt if this amount of metallic substrate got lodged in you” he transmitted, his shelled face’s mandibles clicking furiously in obvious agitation. His eyes darting between the three ranking officers but giving no ground. 

Reggie held his hands up placatingly and said “Sorry to have disturbed your flow, I know how important that is to you fine gents, we'll leave now” and rapidly turned to walk away motioning the other two to follow quickly. 

“What was that about?” said Jamie to Dorian, confused as to why they were so unwelcome. 

“Don't stress bud, that's just what they're like” chuckled Dorian, his normal talking pace returning thanks to his Ox top ups “they are the best engineers in the galaxy by a serious margin, however they are almost as uptight as the Sarlan’s in their own way” he laughed, thinking to himself for a moment “I had a friend who swears that a Grrzen once completely shut down an entire cargo run because he hadn't fixed a door to quite the specifications that he wanted it to and the Captain ordered him to hurry up. Apparently it got very messy, both physically and politically. They are pack creatures you see, so they automatically back each other” he shrugged, laughing. 

“Yea, that's why I just left them to it” laughed Reggie “Absolutely no point poking the bear if they're doing good work, so I got us out of there before they staged a crudding mutiny, stroppy gits even if they are incredible at what they do” he sighed. 

The three of them decided that they would part ways for the afternoon as any news would come to them through the communicators, disseminated to them by the security team, so Jamie headed back to his room the weight of the last few days seeming to become more of a burden with each step. So much had happened, he could barely take it all in. When he got back to the room, he decided he would distract himself by trying to organise some sort of wardrobe and attempt to make a sheath for the knife he hoped was still there. As he whiled away the time, he began to search the net for information, he needed to know what planet he'd been on and why the war was over.

After a few hours of this Jamie had given himself a prodigious headache and decided he'd had enough, heading to the universal drinks machine to make a coffee for himself. Christ, I'm starving, he thought to himself. He figured he'd had enough of people for one day, so he headed up to the mess hall alone, content to just grab a meal to go. As he waited his turn, he couldn't help but notice the crew members staring at his massive frame, their misgivings and fear palpable in the air like an unpleasant mist hanging in the air, it felt like it was heavy in his lungs, smothering almost. As he got his meal, he quickly rushed out of the crowded hall, his heart rate quickening by the second, until he was almost running back to his room. 

As he reached his room, his thoughts wildly rushing through his mind, heart beating at twice the normal pace, pain flashing across his chest like a warning that had no root cause he tried to calm himself and sat on the bed, massaging his chest, the sweat beading on him until he was slick with it. His neck felt tight, like he couldn't breathe, the pressure of his chest feeling like it was stopping him from inhaling far enough to get enough air in his lungs. His head swam as he struggled to get a grip on what was happening, nothing about the situation feeling right. He managed to find the edge of the bed with his hands, looked at the simulated clock on the wall and noticed the seconds ticking by, then the noise of the simulated birdsong, only now realising that he hadn't been hearing them until now. He started to breath in time with the clock, steadying himself as he did, gripping the bed so hard that he'd bent it. The minutes ticked by agonisingly slowly as his breathing started to come back to normal. What was that all about? He thought when he'd finally begun to calm down, finally looking at his now lukewarm meal box.

Once the episode had finished and he'd gotten some food on board, he led there utterly exhausted, his mind and body seemingly having used up every ounce of energy, slipping fitfully into sleep, his dreams chaotic and nightmarish.

1ksa9xl,https://www.reddit.com/r/FSBOresouces/comments/1ksa9xl/selling_your_home_by_owner_highlights_from_todays/,Selling Your Home By Owner? Highlights From Today’s FSBO Networking Call,"Just got off another great FSBO networking call, and as always, the group brought a ton of real-world experience and great advice. If you're selling your home without an agent (or even just considering it), here's what came up that could really help you succeed:

**1. Why FSBO?**  
People on the call are selling everything from multi-unit homes in the Pacific Northwest to high-rise condos in California. What they all shared was a clear motivation: they know their homes best, and they don’t want to hand over tens of thousands in commission to someone who doesn’t add real value.

**2. Legal Help: Non-Negotiable**  
Whether your state uses attorneys or title companies, the consensus was clear: *you need someone competent on your side*. Not all attorneys are FSBO-friendly—ask up front if they’re comfortable guiding an owner-led sale. A few hundred dollars here can save you major headaches later.

**3. Pricing: Think Range, Not Number**  
One tip that came up a lot: don’t aim for a single “magic number.” Understand your home’s value *range* by looking at recent sales *and* active competition. Appraisals and pre-listing inspections can be a smart investment, especially if you want to avoid surprises or negotiation tactics from buyers later on.

**4. Marketing: The Smarter You Are, The Less You Spend**  
This was a big topic—and for good reason. FSBO sellers don’t have the automatic exposure of the MLS, so you need to be creative and intentional. Here are some of the tips that came up:

* **Start with your network** before hitting the MLS. Once it's listed, the ""days on market"" counter starts, which can hurt your leverage if the home sits too long.
* **Facebook Marketplace** and **Craigslist** are free, widely used, and still effective—just make sure your listing looks clean and professional.
* **Social media** is a must—post on community pages, tag local friends, and ask neighbors to share.
* **Flyers** work—mail them to your condo building or put them up at local supermarkets, libraries, gyms, or coffee shops.
* **Make sure your neighbors know your home is for sale.** They may know someone who’s looking—and they’re often the best ambassadors for your neighborhood.
* **Reach out to schools.** Admissions staff at private schools and PTA heads at public ones often know families moving into the area. Let them know your home is available.
* **Think about your buyer:** If your home is ideal for a family, target school communities. If you're in a retiree-friendly area, reach out to local senior centers or churches. Near a major employer? Contact their HR team and let them know a move-in-ready property is available.
* **Use tools like** [**SaveOnYourHome.com**](https://www.saveonyourhome.com/)—free to list, includes a yard sign with a QR code that takes buyers straight to your online listing (no app required, no redirection to agents).

**5. Not All Offers Are Equal**  
We dove deep on contingencies. A cash offer might come in lower—but without mortgage or inspection contingencies, it could be the smoother deal. Others might offer more but need 45 days and three layers of contingencies. Know the tradeoffs. Look beyond price.

**6. Agents? Optional—Not Evil**  
This isn’t an anti-agent group. It’s a *pro-choice* group. Some sellers are open to buyers’ agents if the offer makes sense. The benefit of FSBO is *you decide*. No locked-in listing agreements. No blanket 6% commitments. If the deal is right, you can say yes. If it’s not, you can keep looking.

I searched the table for markings or signatures and could not find anything on there.

The condition of the table isn’t great. The marble is broken and the legs are very loose, but it feels legit.

1ksa37j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ksa37j/i_have_bad_breath_and_i_dont_know_why/,I have bad breath and I don't know why,"I (27F) have been experiencing issues with bad breath for 6-10 months now (best I can tell), and can't figure out the cause or what I can do to fix it. My partner is the one who identified it, but I can't tell a difference at all, and can't smell it when it's bad. The bad breath is not consistent day to day (there most days but not always), but when it occurs it seems to happen at night after dinner, or less often after lunch, but remaining through the evening.

I don't think the smell is a oral hygiene problem. I have never had any cavities, oral infections, or teeth problems. My mom was a dentist so I learned and practiced great oral hygiene techniques all my life. I have a dentist appointment scheduled, but it is a month and a half out because my dental office was all booked up. But I brush, floss, and rinse daily if not more and have examined my teeth thoroughly and don't have any signs of cavities that I can tell. As well, cleaning my mouth does not seem to help the smell more than just covering it up with mint for a few minutes. I have also added in oil pulling with a dental brand containing erythrytol and that has not helped either, and have even added in a product called biocydin (toothpaste) that is supposed to disrupt biofilms and thus reduce bacterial build up, but that has also not helped. Also, the distinct smell is not present in the morning after sleep, and is different from my morning breath, even if I go to sleep with THE bad breath at night. All those things lead me to think it is a different problem. 

My partner has described the smell as vaguely rotten. More like rotten vegetables than rotten fruits, but not a super close comparison. Also possibly a hint of gasoline, but overall the smell is hard to described. He says it doesn't smell particularly like sulfur, fish, acetone, or sweet. 

I have a family history of diabetes, so the first thing I checked was ketones using a pee stick, but that was normal. I also monitor my A1C regularly and it has not changed or flagged as high (5.4-5.5). 

I am wondering if my bad breath is tied to anything else metabolic? Or if it could be something bacterial in my sinuses or lungs or throat? I have tried using a netty pot when it is bad, but that doesn't seem to help much, and I have experimented with various dietary changes such as eliminating dairy and gluten for 8 weeks. Other information: I don't smoke or drink alcohol, and I drink coffee about 2 times a month (as a treat, not a habit). I don't eat a ton of sugar or processed carbs/foods but I will have some milk chocolate a couple times a day. 

I'm kind of desperate to find a solution since nothing I change seems to have a strong correlation, and it is really messing with my confidence since I don't know when it is bad or not.

My partner is the one who identified it, but I can't tell a difference at all, and can't smell it when it's bad. The bad breath is not consistent day to day (there most days but not always), but when it occurs it seems to happen at night after dinner, or less often after lunch, but remaining through the evening.

I don't think the smell is a oral hygiene problem. I have never had any cavities, oral infections, or teeth problems. My mom was a dentist so I learned and practiced great oral hygiene techniques all my life. I have a dentist appointment scheduled, but it is a month and a half out because my dental office was all booked up. But I brush, floss, and rinse daily if not more and have examined my teeth thoroughly and don't have any signs of cavities that I can tell. As well, cleaning my mouth does not seem to help the smell more than just covering it up with mint for a few minutes. I have also added in oil pulling with a dental brand containing erythrytol and that has not helped either, and have even added in a product called biocydin (toothpaste) that is supposed to disrupt biofilms and thus reduce bacterial build up, but that has also not helped.

I haven't lost weight in the scale because I'm premenstrual (yay). I did lose 0.6 kgs the first day, and then I gained, and now I'm back to my starting weight. 

In the mirror I can see I've lost size.

The best thing for me is feeling more energised! I'm feeling the best in years!

I'm on three strong pain killers. I'm waiting for surgery. I've been carnivore since July 23. I started eating higher fat about two months ago. I lost the most weight when I was eating cream, but I didn't know that high fat was making me lose weight. 

I had 330 grams of mince (beef) meat with 200 ml of cream, plus some garlic. I'm having 200 ml of cream with a small amount of coffee in it. I love my breakfast. I look forward to it every day. 

Next week I'm going to buy some chuck steak and cook it so it's pull apart tender. 

I love this way of eating! It actually saves me money as well which is awesome!

(aka: “Why I eat like a dog now”)

A few weeks ago, I posted a picture with no context—so here’s the backstory.

Oct 2022my gf at the time convinced me to go back to the gym. I just hit 300lbs (this picture was taken after I started) In highschool we both played sports and were fit. I hated it at first pretty much felt like she forced me to go. About 1.5 years in I found out she was cheating on me. I did the whole I do this for you, blah blah blah. She said well if you hate it so much you shouldn’t do it. I fell out of it for a month or 2 then realized I really enjoyed it. Ever since it’s been my home and tbh my happy place. The days I don’t go rest days or I can’t go make me sad. So no matter if you fall or mess up you can always start back! 


My Routine

I work out six days a week, but that’s not even the hard part—I’m also the primary PE coach (K-9th) which means I’m basically on a treadmill called my job. I get a minimum of 1 hour of cardio daily, sometimes up to 4 hours on some days, depending on how many classes I teach.

Gym Schedule:
	•	Hit the gym at 5 AM
	•	Out by 6:30–7 AM
	•	At work by 8 AM 

Workout Split:
	•	Monday: Chest + Shoulders
	•	Tuesday: Back
	•	Wednesday: Legs
	•	Thursday: Chest
	•	Friday: Arms
	•	Saturday: Legs (again, because walking normally is overrated)
	•	Abs: Only on the days I feel like it (aka: rare—abs make me feel like I’m gonna throw up)

Note: I don’t do cardio at the gym. I lift weights there and get 14+ hours of “bonus” cardio from my job every week.

For everyday set I’ve done the past 24 weeks add me here https://trainfitness.ai/referral/yuth (shameless plug) 
App that connects to my watch makes it much easier to track 

My Food (aka: The Dog Food Diet)

At first, eating the same thing every day sucks. But after a while, you kinda become like a dog with its dog food—just happy to eat.

Breakfast (Pre-Gym):
	•	1 protein bar or eggs
	•	1 cutie (tiny orange, not a nickname for myself—yet)

Post-Workout Shakes (8–9 AM):
Twice a day. Recipe:
	•	300 mL almond milk (35 cal)
	•	1 scoop coffee protein powder
	•	A little ice cream syrup (don’t judge)
	•	Teaspoon espresso 
      •    Sugar free creamer 
	•		•	200 mL water

Go-To Snacks:
	•	2–3 protein bars a day
	•	Usually Barbell bars or Puff Bars (not sponsored, just addicted)
	•	Grapes – my ride-or-die sweet treat 
	•	Pirate’s Booty or Drizzilicious rice cakes – low-cal but dangerously bingeable. Full bag? 700 calories. Regret? Immediate.

Lunch (Main Meal):
	•	1 lb 96% lean ground beef
	•	1 bag cauliflower rice
	•	½ can spaghetti-style tomato sauce
Weird combo, I know—but it hits. Could ditch the sauce to save 100 cals, but it’s one of the few meals I actually enjoy.

Dinner:
Still living at home, so when the family’s eating things like lasagna or potato soup, I pivot.
	•	More protein bars
	•	Eggs
	•	Frozen tilapia (cheap and clean protein I keep in my own freezer)

On Long Days (Tues/Thurs):
	•	Extra protein bar around 3 PM

On long-distance cardio or race days:
	•	Protein pancakes (a rare treat for big runs)
	•	Nerd Gummy Clusters + a protein bar for quick fuel

Yes tracking it all and it being limited is tedious but I want to be sexyyyyyy

My diet isn’t perfect. I’m probably missing some vitamins or healthy fats—but let’s be real: the average person’s diet isn’t perfect either. And at least I’m consistent.

Yes, I’ve got loose skin and still hold extra fat on my thighs, stomach, and obliques. It’s part of the deal. I used to try all the dumb stuff too. At one point I did a chicken-only diet. I dropped to 185 lbs in 8 months, but I felt like pure trash. No energy. No joy. Never again.

Now, I just lift, move a lot, eat like a consistent robot dog, and feel better doing it

Lmk if you have questions, need help, or want to see the cursed chicken-only before pics.",2,1747863653.0,progresspics,2,1.0,False

One thing that I have the goal of trying by May 26 (I set goals every week) is to say something to someone going to a coffee shop.

I once accidentally handed over a patient… to another patient.

I was working patient transport, knackered, running on vending machine coffee and regret. I get to the ward, see a bloke in scrubs with a clipboard—classic nurse starter pack. I do the full handover, like, ‘Here’s Derek, he’s diabetic, he’s kicked me twice, he needs his meds by six.’

The bloke nods seriously. Doesn’t say a word. Just wheels the patient off like he’s got a pension and a lanyard.

Turns out… he was another patient.

I’d literally handed over a vulnerable adult… to a slightly more enthusiastic, institutionalised vulnerable adult. Basically NHS pass-the-parcel.

And the best bit? He took it seriously. He was like, ‘Right, we’ll get your obs done and see if the doc’s free.’ Like babes, you’ve just tried to set fire to a wet flannel. But thanks for stepping up.

In hindsight, they should’ve just sectioned me on the spot. Would’ve saved the NHS a ton of paperwork—and me two years of pretending I was fine.

Because here’s the thing—I used to drop people off at mental health wards, and I was convinced it was a trap. Like I’d be halfway through a handover and someone would go, ‘Alright love, your turn now. Hand over the ID.’

I’d leg it out of there like I was escaping Scientology. No eye contact. No sudden movements.

And then a few years later… I’m back. But this time, I’m not holding the clipboard. I am the clipboard.”

A Day in the Mental Health Ward

“Mental health is such a taboo subject. People say you should talk about it, but the second you do, they run for the nearest exit. I never thought I’d end up in a psych ward. But in my defense, I also never thought I’d cry because my toast was slightly too toasted, yet here we are.

At first, I thought the mental health ward would be like One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. People walking around like zombies, shuffling, staring at the wall, unable to tell the time. How mistaken was I! Because that’s actually the staff, not the patients. It’s a war zone in there, honestly.

I remember once there was a commotion in one of the lounges. Now, I love a bit of drama, so I did what any sane person in a psych ward does—grabbed some crayons and started colouring while eavesdropping. Turns out, the TV remote had gone missing. Now in normal life, that’s annoying. But in a psych ward, where there’s literally nothing else to do, that remote is our only connection to reality. This was the worst thing that could happen! Not because it was stuck on Capital Radio, playing extremely loud, but because I knew that remote could be anywhere, and the staff can’t possibly change the channel by the TV. That remote is the most important thing on that ward—it’s even more protected than the medication. I once asked for my meds, and the nurse said, ‘Sorry, I’m busy.’ I looked over, and she was on all fours, searching under the sofa for the remote. I could be losing my mind, but God forbid we lose the ability to watch Loose Women.”

⸻

The Ward Dynamics

Another thing I noticed is that people with mental health problems love ordering food. There was this one patient who ordered a takeaway every single night. Where was the money coming from? Benefits? Black market meds? Had they secretly invested in Bitcoin? I asked them once, and they just winked. Now I’ll never know!

One time, there was a patient with one of those creepy reborn dolls—proper realistic, like it just walked out of Call the Midwife. Another patient hated it. One day, they stormed into the room, snatched the doll, held it up like Simba in The Lion King, and shouted, ‘This is what the lord calls Sin!’ Then they sprinted down the corridor like they were on a divine mission to rid the world of plastic infants. Staff eventually got the doll back, but honestly? I don’t think it was ever the same again. You can’t just survive an exorcism and go back to being a normal fake baby.

There was this woman on the ward who just refused to wear clothes. Like, fully committed to nudity as a lifestyle. Didn’t matter the time of day—morning meds, lunch, a fire drill—she was out there, starkers, like some kind of feral wellness guru.

The staff stopped trying after a while. They’d just chuck a hospital sheet over her like she was furniture they were trying to protect from paint splashes. It became a routine—she’d strut down the corridor like a pissed-off ghost, and someone would gently drape a blanket over her like, “There, there. Dignity is optional, but linen is mandatory.”

I admired her, in a way. While the rest of us were having breakdowns over burnt toast and missing meds, she was out here fighting for liberation, one naked lap of the ward at a time. Honestly? Iconic.

⸻

Escapes and Relationships

Patients trying to escape happened on a daily basis. One patient tried to ‘escape’ by casually walking out the front door. Staff stopped them and said, ‘Where do you think you’re going?’ They just shrugged and said, ‘Tesco.’ Honestly, fair enough. If you’re gonna break out, might as well get a meal deal on the way.

There was always one patient who somehow knew everyone’s medication better than the doctors. Like, I’d say, ‘I’m on Venlafaxine,’ and they’d nod, ‘Ah, SSNRI, watch out for the night sweats.’ Like mate, are you a patient or my pharmacist?

There was this one patient who fell in love with a pigeon that used to sit on the windowsill. They’d talk to it, feed it bits of their toast, and one day, they announced, ‘That’s it, we’re getting married.’ They even made a little ring out of a Fruit Pastilles wrapper. The pigeon never actually responded, but honestly? Probably the healthiest relationship in that place. At least the pigeon wasn’t trying to get a takeaway every night. 

⸻

The Aliens and the Catheter

I was casually standing there, biting a polystyrene cup, as you do, when this woman burst in screaming, ‘THE ALIENS ARE COMING!’ Then, without hesitation, she grabbed a cup, started biting it too, and whispered, ‘This will protect us.’ I don’t know what kind of space warfare she was preparing for, but I wasn’t about to take any chances, so I just nodded and kept chewing.

One time, a patient just sat at the dinner table, completely unbothered, casually emptying her catheter like she was topping up a drink. No shame. No hesitation. Just a full-on medical procedure mid-lasagna. The worst part? No one even reacted. That’s when I realised I’d officially been there too long.

By the end of my time in the ward, I was starting to think maybe I belonged there. You get so used to the chaos, the strange routines, and the bizarre moments, that normal life just feels weird.

I remember one day, I thought I had finally cracked it. I was talking to this patient who was obsessed with escape plans—they had this elaborate scheme involving the fire exit, some string, and a stolen pen from the nurse’s station. But here’s the kicker—they actually managed to talk me into believing it might work. I started making plans in my head like I was really about to break out of Shawshank.

Then, as we were ‘plotting,’ the nurse walks by and says, ‘You two need anything?’

Without skipping a beat, this person goes, ‘Yeah, can we get some more pens? These ones are running low.’

Honestly, that was the moment I realised: we might all be a little crazy, but we’re all in this together. And at the end of the day, escaping wasn’t the goal. Surviving it was.

So now, whenever I feel like I’m losing it, I think back to that escape plan. You know? Just in case the pigeons are right and the aliens really are coming.

⸻

Staff Support (or Lack Thereof)

Some of the staff were lovely, genuinely. But some of them? I wouldn’t trust them to water a plant, never mind care for people on the edge.

You’d press the buzzer and twenty minutes later they’d appear like they’d just woken up in a different dimension. One nurse came in once and went, “What do you want now?” I was like, “…basic human dignity?”

At one point, I cried for two hours straight in a beanbag chair and the only person who checked on me was the maintenance man.

There were staff who clearly hated us, like we were inconveniencing them by existing. I get it—it’s a hard job. But if you need to emotionally detach that much, maybe don’t work in a place full of people trying not to die. 

One staff member came with me to the hospital. As soon as we got there, she looked at my twin sister and—dead serious—asked if she was my mum. Off to a cracking start. Then, while I was busy reverse-engineering my insides into a sick bowl, she looked me dead in the eye and asked, “Are you okay?” Like girl… do I look okay? I’m auditioning for The Exorcist 2 over here. Meanwhile, she spent the rest of the time sipping coffee like she was on a brunch date with the tea lady. Five stars. Would recommend.

There was one staff member who, I’m convinced, didn’t come to work—she came for the food. She’d queue up with us like she was clocking in for her prison sentence, tray in hand, eyes locked on the beige slop like it was Michelin-starred. She once elbowed a patient out the way for the last jacket potato. I watched it happen. I thought, Wow… someone here really does need sectioning—and it’s not me this time. She even asked if she could have seconds once, while I was sat crying into a dry sponge pudding trying to remember my own name.

It was comforting, in a bleak way—like yeah, my mind’s in pieces, but at least I’m not fighting mentally unwell people for lukewarm mash. Not yet.

I once told a nurse I’m a paramedic, and she immediately asked if I could show her how to use a pen torch. A pen torch. As in… the most basic medical tool in existence. I was like, “Sure—this end goes in the eye, and this end goes in the bin if you’re relying on me for training.”

It was a humbling moment. Not because she didn’t know—because I realised I was now the most qualified person in the building, and I’d just cried for twenty minutes because someone ate the last bit of toast. ",1,1747863380.0,stories,2,1.0,False

Not because it was stuck on Capital Radio, playing extremely loud, but because I knew that remote could be anywhere, and the staff can’t possibly change the channel by the TV. That remote is the most important thing on that ward—it’s even more protected than the medication. I once asked for my meds, and the nurse said, ‘Sorry, I’m busy.’ I looked over, and she was on all fours, searching under the sofa for the remote. I could be losing my mind, but God forbid we lose the ability to watch Loose Women.”

The Ward Dynamics

Another thing I noticed is that people with mental health problems love ordering food. There was this one patient who ordered a takeaway every single night. Where was the money coming from? Benefits? Black market meds? Had they secretly invested in Bitcoin? I asked them once, and they just winked. Now I’ll never know!

One time, there was a patient with one of those creepy reborn dolls—proper realistic, like it just walked out of Call the Midwife. Another patient hated it. One day, they stormed into the room, snatched the doll, held it up like Simba in The Lion King, and shouted, ‘This is what the lord calls Sin!’ Then they sprinted down the corridor like they were on a divine mission to rid the world of plastic infants. Staff eventually got the doll back, but honestly? I don’t think it was ever the same again. You can’t just survive an exorcism and go back to being a normal fake baby.

There was this woman on the ward who just refused to wear clothes. Like, fully committed to nudity as a lifestyle. Didn’t matter the time of day—morning meds, lunch, a fire drill—she was out there, starkers, like some kind of feral wellness guru.

The staff stopped trying after a while. They’d just chuck a hospital sheet over her like she was furniture they were trying to protect from paint splashes. It became a routine—she’d strut down the corridor like a pissed-off ghost, and someone would gently drape a blanket over her like, “There, there. Dignity is optional, but linen is mandatory.”

I admired her, in a way. While the rest of us were having breakdowns over burnt toast and missing meds, she was out here fighting for liberation, one naked lap of the ward at a time. Honestly? Iconic.

⸻

Escapes and Relationships

Patients trying to escape happened on a daily basis. One patient tried to ‘escape’ by casually walking out the front door. Staff stopped them and said, ‘Where do you think you’re going?’ They just shrugged and said, ‘Tesco.’ Honestly, fair enough. If you’re gonna break out, might as well get a meal deal on the way.

There was always one patient who somehow knew everyone’s medication better than the doctors. Like, I’d say, ‘I’m on Venlafaxine,’ and they’d nod, ‘Ah, SSNRI, watch out for the night sweats.’ Like mate, are you a patient or my pharmacist?

There was this one patient who fell in love with a pigeon that used to sit on the windowsill. They’d talk to it, feed it bits of their toast, and one day, they announced, ‘That’s it, we’re getting married.’ They even made a little ring out of a Fruit Pastilles wrapper. The pigeon never actually responded, but honestly? Probably the healthiest relationship in that place. At least the pigeon wasn’t trying to get a takeaway every night. 

⸻

The Aliens and the Catheter

I was casually standing there, biting a polystyrene cup, as you do, when this woman burst in screaming, ‘THE ALIENS ARE COMING!’ Then, without hesitation, she grabbed a cup, started biting it too, and whispered, ‘This will protect us.’ I don’t know what kind of space warfare she was preparing for, but I wasn’t about to take any chances, so I just nodded and kept chewing.

One time, a patient just sat at the dinner table, completely unbothered, casually emptying her catheter like she was topping up a drink. No shame. No hesitation. Just a full-on medical procedure mid-lasagna. The worst part? No one even reacted. That’s when I realised I’d officially been there too long.

By the end of my time in the ward, I was starting to think maybe I belonged there. You get so used to the chaos, the strange routines, and the bizarre moments, that normal life just feels weird.

I remember one day, I thought I had finally cracked it. I was talking to this patient who was obsessed with escape plans—they had this elaborate scheme involving the fire exit, some string, and a stolen pen from the nurse’s station. But here’s the kicker—they actually managed to talk me into believing it might work. I started making plans in my head like I was really about to break out of Shawshank.

Then, as we were ‘plotting,’ the nurse walks by and says, ‘You two need anything?’

Without skipping a beat, this person goes, ‘Yeah, can we get some more pens? These ones are running low.’

Honestly, that was the moment I realised: we might all be a little crazy, but we’re all in this together. And at the end of the day, escaping wasn’t the goal. Surviving it was.

So now, whenever I feel like I’m losing it, I think back to that escape plan. You know? Just in case the pigeons are right and the aliens really are coming.

⸻

Staff Support (or Lack Thereof)

Some of the staff were lovely, genuinely. But some of them? I wouldn’t trust them to water a plant, never mind care for people on the edge.

You’d press the buzzer and twenty minutes later they’d appear like they’d just woken up in a different dimension. One nurse came in once and went, “What do you want now?” I was like, “…basic human dignity?”

At one point, I cried for two hours straight in a beanbag chair and the only person who checked on me was the maintenance man.

There were staff who clearly hated us, like we were inconveniencing them by existing. I get it—it’s a hard job. But if you need to emotionally detach that much, maybe don’t work in a place full of people trying not to die. 

One staff member came with me to the hospital. As soon as we got there, she looked at my twin sister and—dead serious—asked if she was my mum. Off to a cracking start. Then, while I was busy reverse-engineering my insides into a sick bowl, she looked me dead in the eye and asked, “Are you okay?” Like girl… do I look okay? I’m auditioning for The Exorcist 2 over here. Meanwhile, she spent the rest of the time sipping coffee like she was on a brunch date with the tea lady. Five stars. Would recommend.

There was one staff member who, I’m convinced, didn’t come to work—she came for the food. She’d queue up with us like she was clocking in for her prison sentence, tray in hand, eyes locked on the beige slop like it was Michelin-starred. She once elbowed a patient out the way for the last jacket potato. I watched it happen. I thought, Wow… someone here really does need sectioning—and it’s not me this time. She even asked if she could have seconds once, while I was sat crying into a dry sponge pudding trying to remember my own name.

It was comforting, in a bleak way—like yeah, my mind’s in pieces, but at least I’m not fighting mentally unwell people for lukewarm mash. Not yet.

I once told a nurse I’m a paramedic, and she immediately asked if I could show her how to use a pen torch. A pen torch. As in… the most basic medical tool in existence. I was like, “Sure—this end goes in the eye, and this end goes in the bin if you’re relying on me for training.”

It was a humbling moment. Not because she didn’t know—because I realised I was now the most qualified person in the building, and I’d just cried for twenty minutes because someone ate the last bit of toast. ",1,1747863248.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

1ks9qfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditvision_sc/comments/1ks9qfk/rsc_77_capture_the_moment_country_claims/,RSC 77 ☆ Capture the Moment (Country Claims),"My last… first day of school. I wouldn’t say it was particularly special; it was mostly icebreakers and introductions to what our courses would be like for the remainder of the year. I’m not sure if three AP courses are a good idea, but if it saves me money in the long run, I guess I can bear the horrors until the exams… And trust me. AP Physics sounds horrific. At least I have some friends in that class. They seemed to have understood the summer assignment better than I did, so hopefully they can drag me across the finish line come May. I guess I’m **feeling like the main character in my own tragedy**.

But enough about that! I had a great time with u/BebeLuigi and u/Foobibby. Like usual, we ordered pizza from Did You Pizza? and played Smash Bros. Everyone hates to see my Ness coming. At one point, we got a bit tired of it and just watched random videos on YouTube over chips and popcorn. *history of the entire redditvision song contest, i guess* never gets old, no matter how many times we watch it.

Around midnight or so, we ended up walking the boardwalk by the beach. With August nearing its end and summer winding down, it was pretty cold, actually. Goosebumps danced along my skin, and u/BebeLuigi lended me his favorite Spheal cardigan that he had brought with him just in case. He’s always been prepared, so I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised.

I took a few pictures of the water, even if the streetlamps and moonlight did a poor job of illuminating the beach. I don’t really know why. We don’t live that far away, but I guess I wanted to capture the memory of how serene it was. We took a few selfies too, even if u/Foobibby has always shied away from cameras. I guess he preferred to be on the other side of the lens, but that made sense—we were all on the yearbook committee. We were all pretty good photographers, but the guys always had a better eye for the best angles as compared to me. I just did the formatting; everyone says I have a real knack for making their work shine.

Anyway, we parted ways sometime around one AM. I only just got home a little while ago, and I’m absolutely exhausted. And we already have a yearbook meeting tomorrow after school! Maybe I’ll make a coffee to go after I have my morning cup. Damn, how did last year’s seniors do it…?

And I need to write it down somewhere before I forget. I’m supposed to collect something from the rest of the graduating class. It’s a bit of an annual tradition that the yearbook committee has been doing, and it has to be something unique that each student will be associated with. Something that’s never been done before.

Maybe… Maybe countries? That could be cool. I can ask everyone to submit at least three countries and do it on a first come, first serve basis. Let me write that up now before I go to sleep because I know myself. It’s not getting written if I don’t do it now.

1. Is it time I actually get a new phone? Google said to when it dips below 80%, but how true is that?

2. If I upgrade, is the 16 pro max actually worth it? I really just care about battery, camera, and storage. Or what do you all recommend?

1ks9jda,https://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/1ks9jda/dirty_harry_build_idea_any_advice_before_i_start/,Dirty Harry Build Idea - Any advice before I start the run?,"Mods that I am using or considering: Shabby Suits (for an open grey suit), Signature Armor and Weapon (to keep his suit and his midgame weapon viable), one that makes the Police Pistol double action. Maybe a face preset. One I'm having some issues with is finding a good, but pretty conservative, apartment in Freeside, was imagining the PD or Mojave Express payed for his room and board down in the area. Not too shabby but not a fancy place either. Maybe some other mods for the revolvers'd be good? Was thinking a funk or jazz-funk (a la the Lalo Schifrin soundtracks) radio station too, if anyone knows one. Might also download a rifle mod as I detail in Weapons below. Otherwise not sure what'd be good for this specific character and I'm open to any interesting suggestions. 



Backstory for this Falloutized interpretation is as follows: SFPD Inspector ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan was born in the 2230s in the NCR city of San Francisco. He grew up poor in the Potrero Hill neighborhood, with a bit of an authority issue. After getting in an altercation with the police, he gets offered a choice to either go to prison, or join the military for an expunged record. He did the latter and got pretty good at his job before joining SFPD to settle down with his wife, who died only a year or two later after she was hit by a fixed-up prewar Chryslus. This, and his military tours against raiders, had made him cynical. After being transferred out of Homicide Division for some questionable use of force, he gets signed up to Mojave Express by the Department to go on a wild goose chase as a package courier in the contested Mojave, get him out of their hair for a bit. After some ""Interdepartmental loans"" to Hopeville PD here and there, he gets offered a job to take and deliver a ""Platinum Chip"" to the Vegas strip. The Department OKs this job offer to keep him out in the sticks for a little longer, and the rest is history. Thank God Benny was only using a 9mm and not the most powerful handgun in the world, huh?

  
For Roleplay: It's Harry Callahan so he has to be sarcastic when that's an option. He hates bigotry, in part because you should detest everyone equally. For factions, I'd say NCR. He doesn't like when the law drags its feet too much so he'd say, help Meyers and not the NCR take Primm. But as seen in Magnum Force he thinks vigilantism can go too far (like say, Inculta burning down Nipton?) and he IS a police inspector, so he'd do detective work and ask questions on any quest where that's an option, such as in One For My Baby. House, Callahan isn't exactly a friend to communism but I don't see him getting onboard with ""Ayn Rand but with killer police robots"" either. Yes Man, Callahan wouldn't want either anarchy (in either the biker gang or college student idealist ways), and I don't see him as ruler of Vegas. Legion, just a bunch of jumped-up bandits same as he used to kill in the military, just scumbags to be put down. Dirty Harry doesn't worry about the ethics of self defense much and if it wouldn't be suicidal (Man has to know his limitations!), goes out of his way to whack Raiders. If someone is in imminent danger though, he puts himself in said danger to protect them, especially women. Chems, Callahan isn't gonna do em. Maybe alcohol or coffee. Might sell chems when they're found, it IS the Wasteland and drugs are pretty socially acceptable, just not something I see Callahan, even a Fallout-ized version who might be more OK with drugs, doing himself. Stimpacks, RadX, RadAway, or using drugs in a medical context, I could see, just not recreationally/as combat-enhancements. Healing Powder and such, feel he'd write that off as hippie dippie nonsense and only use that sort of thing as a last resort.



Weapons: Gonna go to Yvette in the Monte Carlo Suites and whack her for the .44 Magnum she carries as soon as that's reasonable. Other mods I'm using are Tammer's NIFBash Weapon Megapack which adds in a .357 Snubnose, and one that adds the Police Pistol into the base game. That's gonna be his ""backup gun"" and what he carries into the casinos and The Fort. The mod also adds the AutoMagnum but he's better known for his revolver and only had the Auto for one movie. He carries a Switchblade as a tertiary weapon, and maybe some grenades or launchers if they're found ""in situ"" prior to selling em for caps or stashing them, like how he uses the LAW in The Enforcer. Not exactly something he'd carry day to day but if he has a chance to use it, why not? Very early game I'll use what I can get until I get the .357 Snubnose or at least Police Pistol and the .44 Magnum up and running. Early game 9mm pistols, youth shotguns, or .22 bolt actions wouldn't be Callahan's first pick but if he was offered one and wasn't armed, I don't see him turning one down. For Hoover Dam, I'd either use the GRA Battle Rifle or the unique version after turning Contreras in. Its what Eastwood used in Gran Torino and its the sort of thing a police department'd keep in the back of their truck in the 1970s/80s. A pump shotgun might be fitting for this instead. Also might download the TactiGhoul Winchester Model 70 in .264 Magnum and only use its iron sights as a sniper-countersniper rifle. It's not .458 Magnum like in the 1st movie but a Winchester Model 70 in a magnum round is canonically his style. Other weapon use will be situational.

  
SPECIAL for him'd be: Strength 6, Perception 6, Endurance 6, Charisma 4, Intelligence 7, Agility 7, and Luck of 4. Strength and Endurance, he's gotta be in OK shape for those Magnum rounds he likes using, even if his diet is all junk. May do implants or Intense Training too.

1ks9g8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychopath/comments/1ks9g8j/relationships_are_hard/,Relationships are hard.,"The basic human need for being with someone is there. I have that need to be with someone, the problem is, I find very little in common with anyone. And when I do, I find it extremely difficult to not believe they are lying or using me. I find it very difficult to believe anyone could actually love me. 

Part of this is because my past plays at 2x speed through my brain every day. I see everything in hindsight and find it very hard to focus on the now. And there is just something about the woman I'm with being angry with me that completely drains the life out of me. I start down a spiral I cannot control and I start to rebel to get an emotional response because that anger becomes the norm. 

I wanted nothing more than to be the person she believed I was when she was happy. I remember the most significant memories of my life with her, because she made me feel safe enough to say them out loud even though I felt they'd be used against me. 

Now don't get me wrong, I have no compassion for most everyone. I watched a car flip on the highway in front of me and the only thought I had was how this was going to fuck up my timeline for the day. 

But there is something about her that is just entirely different. Maybe it's because we found each other at our absolute worst. Both basically homeless and it felt like sneaking out to see each other whenever we had the chance. 

I remember one of my favorite moments where the only thing that mattered was us. We had just moved into a place together and we had to fight to find a place because our credit was shit. And she came home and I was building our bed frame and we ended up watching a DVD on her TV on a box in the living room that distorted the sound so bad while we layed with each other on a blow up mattress that would be our couch for like 2 or 3 weeks. And the feeling of relief to finally be together like the adults we are. 

Another was going to a cemetery at night and the church goers found us waiting for them to leave so we bullshitted an excuse about looking for a good place to see the stars. Or nearly stepping on a copperhead snake while we walked a trail because we had no money to do anything else. 

But then my issues reared their ugly head. I still after over a year didn't have a car after working 60 hours a week every week for us to eat and have a roof over our heads. At 40 it had been a long time since I'd struggled this hard and I couldn't even take her out with my own ride. 

So I kept telling myself how worthless I was. How can I even be a fraction of what she needed? So I started telling myself it was just manipulation, that she was waiting for the right opportunity. 

I stopped taking care of myself. Little things at first, skip a shower or two. Not want to brush my teeth. Until I had completely retreated into my own mind. It doesn't take much to trigger an episode but they can last a long time without intervention. 

Unfortunately it lasted too long and I became a shell of who she loved. This whole time I thought my biggest regret was my failed 2nd marriage, but it wasn't. 

It's not hearing her footsteps when she came home, that beautiful walk she has, seeing her on a weekend morning with her coffee with just a little bit of water to cool it off. The jokes, the laying down for bed and telling jokes to get her laugh before we conked out for the night and being yelled at for being too loud when we laughed. 

Of all the bad shit my mind created that wasn't even true, because I shut down and wouldn't talk. 

I will never ever forget the best things.

We only dated for a few months (situationship) and broke up. She was the one interested in me first etc and we both enjoyed our time together. She didn’t want anything serious anymore and wanted to be friends, but because I had feelings for her, I didn’t want to be friends.

We tried being friends with benefits but I then got hurt. I kept changing my mind until she got mad and blocked me. I must admit I sent her several confrontational messages that didn’t make things better. At one point, she told me if I need a friend or a ride she would be happy to help. I didn’t want that.

We haven’t talked since as I’m blocked. I moved back to my country for a year, and now I’m back in Toronto for a job opportunity. I moved to a smaller city. I really feel like I miss her, as a friend. I also changed my number since then, so if she ever unblocked or messaged me, I wouldn’t have seen it.

I don’t know if I should message her and say something like:

“I’m back in Toronto and really need a friend, so if you want to hangout for coffee or other events, I would love that. If you’re still mad or don’t want to be friends, I would understand.”

But it’s a very vulnerable message, and the last thing she told me 2 years ago was “I’m dating someone, please don’t text me again.” That was in response to a hookup I asked her about, which I don’t want anymore.

I’m not sure of this is the correct place to be posting this, but I have a problem and might need some help. I’m also wondering how common my experience is. I had a set of rings on yesterday I often wear, and went to the bathroom. I had the urge to check my hand or look at my finger as I got up to wash them, and noticed one of my rings missing. It could have fallen off, but that’s not the strangest part. It never hit the floor (we have hard-wood,) wasn’t in my pants pockets (I checked more than once,) and I didn’t do anything that would’ve knocked it off, really.

  The other ring(s) was still there. It’s the same size and all, different colored stones. I’ve looked and looked and cannot find it anywhere. I’m still looking and not giving up, just in case. In case someone laughs, my house is very likely haunted, but that’s besides the point. I’d only been in two or three rooms by the time it went missing. I re-traced my steps, again and again. 

  When I say I’ve checked everything I could think of that I’d touched or every place I’d been, I mean it. 

  I’ve read stories like mine where the jewelry ended up returning in a random place, two or three of which were very similar to mine. I’m not sure if I *should* attribute this to a ghost or whatever, but I’ve heard of ghosts or spirits moving things and such. In the case I don’t find it, I’m not sure what to do or how to try and find it or get it back. Does anybody have any other advice on dealing with beloved objects vanishing? I was home alone when this happened, except for my cat, but he was in another room with the door closed, so I doubt he got it.

  I’m really just waiting and looking. The only reason I think it could be paranormal as a last resort is that even if it’s not a spirit, I’ve read where people blame it on a “reality glitch” or something. These rings don’t just slide off usually without force. I even sleep with them on and they stay on. And yes, they were there when I got up and the whole day before-hand. I really don’t understand it, because I’d been looking at it on my hand for the majority of the time I was awake. One minute it was there, the next it wasn’t.

  I even went back and checked all the counters I’d been at and the trash bin in the bathroom, because I changed a toilet paper roll. Nothing. I don’t want to sound crazy and literally say it’s “vanished into thin air,” but I don’t know what else to call it. It’s not like I put it on a table or something, and I didn’t do much — went from drinking coffee on the sofa to the toilet, and if I hadn’t looked down I wouldn’t have noticed it gone. Didn’t feel anything like it falling. 

  I apologize for the massive text and questions are welcome. As I said, I think it just fell or something, but wouldn’t it be laying somewhere around the areas I sat and walked? And wouldn’t I have heard it or felt it? I hope I’m making some sense. Thanks. ",1,1747862235.0,Paranormal,1,1.0,False

⸻

[GUIDE] Removed All Bottlenecks on Area-51M — Now Running Only on RTX 3080 Ti (No iGPU, No RTX 2080, No Optimus)

⸻

Hey folks,

I recently completed a deep graphics config mod on my Alienware Area-51M R1, and it completely transformed how my system behaves and performs. I wanted total control — so گI:
	•	Disabled the Intel iGPU
	•	Disabled the internal RTX 2080
	•	Forced the system to boot and run only from my external RTX 3080 Ti inside the Alienware Graphics Amplifier (AGA)

The result?
No Optimus. No hybrid graphics. No performance routing. Just raw, direct PCIe power from the 3080 Ti.

⸻

Why I did it:

I was tired of:
	•	Games and apps launching on the wrong GPU
	•	Display signal being routed through iGPU due to Optimus
	•	Random GPU switching, driver conflicts, inconsistent performance
	•	RTX 2080 and Intel GPU drawing power and generating heat — even when I didn’t need them

⸻

What I changed (via RU.efi and UEFI Shell):

Setting	Offset	Value	Description
Internal Graphics	0xA5E	0x00	Disabled Intel iGPU
dGPU (RTX 2080)	0x98E	0x00	Disabled internal RTX 2080
eGPU Root Port	0x98F	0x01	Enabled GPU slot for AGA / RTX 3080 Ti
Primary Display	0xA58	0x01	Set to PEG (external GPU as display head)

All changes were made manually using RU.efi in a UEFI Shell.
Monitor is connected directly to the DisplayPort on the 3080 Ti.

⸻

What improved (the real benefits):

✅ Improved performance & smoother FPS
	•	Now every frame is rendered and displayed directly by the RTX 3080 Ti
	•	No iGPU path, no copying frames, no Optimus interference
	•	Games feel noticeably smoother and more responsive, even if the raw FPS doesn’t dramatically increase
	•	I get consistent frame pacing and stable frame times across demanding titles

✅ Lower CPU & GPU temperatures
	•	With both iGPU and RTX 2080 disabled, the laptop’s cooling system no longer has to manage 2–3 GPUs
	•	Internal heat buildup is reduced
	•	CPU package temps dropped by 5–8°C in some scenarios
	•	Fans spin less often and quieter overall

✅ Power efficiency & thermal headroom
	•	Less power draw from unused chips = more thermal headroom for CPU & eGPU
	•	Power delivery stays cleaner, system throttling is reduced
	•	Battery drains slower on idle or light usage

✅ Driver stability
	•	No more switching between GPUs, no surprise crashes or app confusion
	•	Device Manager shows only one GPU — the one I actually use
	•	Fewer background services (no Intel GPU services, no switching daemons)

✅ Cleaner boot, no glitches
	•	Boot is faster and cleaner
	•	No screen flicker, no black-to-white transitions while switching GPUs
	•	Display output comes only from the 3080 Ti — as it should

⸻

Benchmarks & Gaming
	•	3DMark Fire Strike and Time Spy show better consistency and better scores in CPU+GPU tests
	•	In real-world games like STALKER 2, Cyberpunk 2077, and Flight simulator,last of us 2, performance is buttery smooth with no dips
	•	GPU-Z confirms full GPU load, proper bus usage, and no bottleneck through iGPU

⸻

System Specs:
	•	Alienware Area-51M R1
	•	Intel Core i9-9900K
	•	Alienware Graphics Amplifier
	•	EVGA RTX 3080 Ti XC3 Ultra
	• / 2933MHz 128Gb DDR4
	•	Monitor: ASUS 3440x1440, connected via DisplayPort to 3080 Ti
4tra SSD Samsung 970 evo plus
⸻

TL;DR
	•	Disabled Intel iGPU and RTX 2080
	•	Forced system to boot and run ONLY from the RTX 3080 Ti in the Amplifier
	•	Result: better performance, lower temps, zero Optimus, fully stable
	•	External GPU now runs free — no interruptions, no compromises

⸻

Let me know if you want help setting this up — I’ll gladly walk you through it or help you find the right offsets for your system.

Unchain your GPU. Let it breathe. Let it dominate.

I work near Old Street, but find that it really lacks actual specialty coffee shops in the area. 

However, I often venture into the City (Leadenhall/Aldgate/Bank) and find that there are literally *tons* of speciality coffee shop options. It’s genuinely easy to find a place in those areas with very decent batch brews (e.g. Watch House, Ozone, Frequency). And I know some of these places are chains. 

So, I suppose my question is in two parts:

Why has speciality coffee (specifically filter) become so prominent in the City? It’s not typically an area I would associate with this kind of coffee culture. 

And why does it seem this style of coffee is actually more available in the City than in other parts of London I’d expect to be more trend-forward? (Old Street, Shoreditch etc).

After a little over a decade away from riding, I recently got back in the saddle with a brand new 2025 Triumph Trident 660 — picked it up about a week ago. My last bike was a GSX-R600, which I had back in the day, but I’m taking a much more casual and relaxed approach this time around.

Right now, I’m focused on slowly getting reacquainted with riding — taking it one day at a time, practicing the basics, and just getting comfortable again. I plan to retake the MSF course as a refresher to reinforce good habits.

My typical riding will be casual cruising around the city, towns, backroads, and a little bit of highway. Nothing aggressive — mostly coffee stops, exploring new areas, and enjoying the ride.

Here’s the gear I’m currently using (ordered waiting for delivery). I went with what felt safe and quality, but I’m wondering — is this overkill for the kind of riding I’m doing?
	•	Helmet: Arai Quantum-X
	•	Jacket: Alpinestars T-GP Plus R V4 Airflow
	•	Pants: Street & Steel Del Mar Riding Jeans & Mission Cargo Riding Pants
	•	Gloves: Alpinestars SPX Air Carbon V2
	•	Boots: Alpinestars SMX-6 V3 Vented

Appreciate any thoughts or feedback from more experienced (or recently returned) riders. I’m just glad to be back out there — and loving how manageable and fun the Trident is so far!

I am really so confuse about what's happening we are not dating but it feels like our thing is just like we are in relationship. 

So it started on a first meeting that he invited me over in his place for a late night dinner cause he's cooking. But before that we've been talking for a month already and he just decided to randomly asked me for a dinner at his place. Well I felt comfortable going cause I mean we've been talking for a month already. We got so close and we share the same vibe. 

Well I went over to his place and we had the dinner he was cooking infront of me and we are having a good talk with a good wine. We bonded in really a good term and we have the same vibe. 

The first meeting is really good untill it follows another meetings, untill it's our habit to atleast meet once every week for a coffee or to hang out and do some activities together or if we have time if we are not busy we would be meeting on weekdays. Sometimes I'll go to his place or we will meet outside. 

We have this deep talks conversations that we shared secretly, we became comfortable at each others company. If i go to his place he'd just let me do what I want and it feels like it's my 2nd home. To the point that I am wearing his clothes sometimes, he'll do the cooking for us tho' he knew that I am a good cook. He is taking care of me, even when we go out for lunch or for a coffee he will pay everything and he wont let me pay for anything. He will set up a week end plan activities for us all the time. I am also shocked that when his bestfriends from Germany came he called me first to meet them. They even came to my work place to visit me, they waited for my lunch break to be over cause they wanted me to join them for lunch. Well I really get along with them and everytime they go out they usually including me in their plans, which is I am not expecting. By the time his friends was here for vacation they stayed in his place. That time he still asked me to go over to his place to hang out on my day off's or sometimes if I have a free time. Sometimes I stay there for a night or sometimes he will drop me home back if i wish to go home. 

It's so over whelming that he even teaches me how to sky diving tho' i have a fear of heights and he patiently teaches me to overcome it. Now I am okay and I am not afraid of heights anymore. Next thing he is planning again to teach me how to play golf some other activities that i don't know how to do. On the hand he even plan with me some future activities that is like 3-mothns or way far for a year plans.  On my birthday he gave an exclusive gift that I mean It was a cute gift that I really appreciate it. Because the gift screams effort. ( he made a voucher for me to claim 3 wishes that I wanted to do what ever it is and regardless what it is) I mean this is so priceless  

But the thing is we are not dating and we have no label at all. I know his type and we talked about it before cause he have business and he is focused with it. He is even talking to my boy bestfriend more like a brother to me. He told him that he wanted me to be part of his life. Like this really confuse me. His actions and everything is really so confusing. Not gonna lie something is happening between us. More of that he's allowing me to use his phone and his laptops. In his place he's keeping some of my stuff. He even went the mall searching for a gear for me to use on the skydiving. Like he searched for it and he even called me while I'm at work what my size is. I mena we even go together for a shopping to change his wardrobe style and he even ask for my opinion all the time. And about his business he oftenly ask me for advice and my opinions.  Lastly I know he is not dating anyone and I am certain with that. 

I mean what is this? I am so 100% confuse  ",0,1747861784.0,dating_advice,9,0.5,False

I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. The type of connection I want strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavor.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.**  I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1747861723.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

1ks94wb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1ks94wb/vincennes_fontenaysousbois_recommendations/,Vincennes / Fontenay-sous-Bois recommendations?,"Last year my wife and I stayed a few days in Vincennes in March and a week in Fontenay-sous-Bois in May. We had a car, and figured it'd be easier to stay outside of Paris and take the RER into town. Boy were we right, and we were surprised to discover that in addition to finding Paris to be one of the finest cities in the world, we really enjoyed the quiet, easy pace of both Vincennes and Fontenay-sous-Bois and met some fine people there. So, we're going back in a few days for a three-week stay, and managed to secure the same charming apartment a couple of blocks from the Fontenay-sous-Bois RER A station. 

I know the area is probably a little bit obscure, and not really ""Paris"" but I was hoping there'd be some folks here with some specific recommendations in the area (restaurants, coffee shops, boulangeries, pâtisseries, etc.).

FWIW, we really enjoyed everything about the Bois de Vincennes (the ""We Love Green"" music festival is going on while we're in town! woo hoo!) but aside from just strolling around the neighborhoods and shops, I can't think of other ""attractions"" in this area. Are there any?

As far as food and drink go, we had some favorites:

[Maison Lecorvaisier](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ViTAVCSXVzJpKtbVA) \- I could live on the baguettes from this place!

[Boulangerie l'Epi du Bois](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FfPstZaSLHn2RJYR6) \- Probably biased bc it's on our way home from the train station, but this place also has exceptional bread.

[Village Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Wpv8BNXtgc68jP4CA) \- Top notch coffee from a guy who really cares about his product (he's also a Brit ex-pat so it's a nice place for people like me with really crappy French)

[C&C's Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4NW9a6egRkXndoGQ6) \- I feel like if this place was in Paris proper, it would be slammed. Instead, it's just a super chill little place for a fantastic dinner. Delicious! 

Probably silly to include it, but we got a kick out of [Uncle Bumpy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JMWopm53hM3MWjJLA), the French take on American chicken and waffles. Ha! Fast food, but like everything we ate in France, it was excellent for what it was.

Sometimes we would just grab a couple of baguettes on the way home and stop at [Le Petit Marché](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hzshqttUKbs2bSjVA) for a big, beautiful tomato, some cheese, and a bottle of wine and take it back to the apartment for dinner. The owner of this tiny grocery is super-friendly and his produce is top-notch. 

Does anyone have any favorites to add? 

Super excited to be heading back to Paris, and actually pretty stoked to just hang out in this area some more.

Long post alert! 

So, after what feels like a lifetime and 1000+ applications, I’m thrilled (and relieved) to say—I’ve finally landed a Data Engineering Internship at Porsche. And honestly, it *finally* feels like I’ve arrived in the U.S. for real. Not at the airport, not at orientation—*this* moment right here.

Rewind to Fall 2024—I gave up a pretty sweet remote job back home. Solid pay, comfort of family and friends, and a stable career. But I wanted more. I wanted to pursue my Master’s and grow my career. What I didn’t expect was the emotional rollercoaster that came with it.

I was a Senior Software Engineer on the data team at a cybersecurity firm, with \~3 years of experience under my belt. I figured, “Hey, I’ve got a decent profile—I’ll beat the odds.” Yeah… no.

For months, I kept applying—day in, day out. By March, I had only received a handful of OAs and a few HireViews... and then radio silence. That’s when reality started sinking in. I wasn’t new to rejection, but the silence? That hit different.

Just to paint the picture: I applied to 30 roles with references, tailored resumes, and often within minutes of the job being posted. Heck, I had hands-on experience with *three* of those companies. Still got rejected.

People around me said, “Hey, you’ve got leadership experience, maybe try for product roles instead of data.” But it didn’t sit right. I had a dream, and I wasn’t ready to let go of it. So I doubled down—cold emails, networking, referrals, pinging old managers, obsessively refreshing job boards like they owed me money. ehhh rejected! 

And then, One role. No referral. No connection. No perfectly crafted email. Just a tailored application within an hour of it being posted. And boom—got the interview, got the offer. Porsche. Data Engineering Intern. Let’s goooo.

To anyone out there considering dropping everything and taking out a hefty loan for a Master’s—this post isn’t to scare you, but to help you make a *realistic* decision. This job market? A bloodbath. And it doesn’t matter if you were a hotshot back home—the game is different here.

Maybe I could’ve picked a better college location (a metro city would’ve helped), or maybe my university didn’t need to throw 4 (500/600-level mandatory courses) at me just to maintain my F-1 status. But even with all that, breaking through against the odds? Totally worth it.

If you’re still in the trenches, keep going. The rejection hurts. The waiting hurts. But your grit? That’s what’s gonna pull you through.

If you’re a fresh grad considering a Master’s (I'm talking to my F1 buddies here)—please, **get some real work experience first**. The U.S. job market is brutal. It’s flooded with Overqualified but under-experienced students, and industry experience sets you apart more than a high GPA or coursework ever will.

Also, if you're someone who's navigating this mess or planning your journey here, feel free to DM me. I’m more than happy to help in whatever way I can—resumes, interview prep, venting about the system, or even just grabbing a virtual coffee. We’re all in this together.

And finally, my motto through it all:  
Apply, apply… and apply again.

1ks8y7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1ks8y7m/hollow_12/,Hollow [1/2],"The power is going out. That was my last thought as I left the apartment.

Blackouts occurred frequently in the city as a result of faulty power grids and an excessive population. Sometimes, darkness was more common than light.

Driving through Old Town, I was met by blank stares of irritated people on the sidewalks, smoking cigarettes while engaged in heated conversations with neighbors or friends. Windows and shops were blackened against the setting sun with silhouetted figures inside. Indiscernible from the street.

My headlights cut through the encroaching night. Bright yellow lights pooled against the asphalt, reflected by road signs as I traversed the endless highway.

Gradually, the industrial cluster of metropolitan area passed by in a blur, falling away to the rural back roads of undulating prairie pastures and rolling farm fields. Occasionally interspersed by a copse of trees that were either barren or canopied by ruddy brown leaves. Their gnarled branches swayed in the breeze like waving hands. Depending on my direction, they either beckoned me or dismissed me.

I turned on the radio, letting the speakers play whatever station they could catch. Regardless of the channel, a faint wall of static was interwoven with the music. During any other trip, this might’ve bothered me. I’d probably go on a tirade about poor reception and the much-needed modernization of the rural Midwest. But this time was different.

I didn’t mind the dark of night or the horrid static or even the glare of headlights in my rearview mirror. I barely noticed the other cars on the highway, riding my bumper and passing with aggravated honks of their horns. My thoughts were consumed by the letter Sandra had left on the nightstand earlier that evening.

I’m going to Mom’s, the letter had read. I just need some time away. Please don’t try to contact me.

The letter was prefaced by a few paragraphs explaining how exasperated she’d felt these last two years. Detailing her deep-seated frustration with our marriage. How I worked too much. And whenever I was home, she felt my presence was empty. That I was too reserved and detached. As if I weren’t ever truly there.

Our marriage is hollow, she had written. It’s as real as a shadow on the wall. A disguise to wear out in public so you can appear normal. You want a house because everyone at work has one. You want a promotion to make more money, but you don’t even like your job. You say you want to start a family, but you have no preference for how many kids or what to name them or their futures. You don’t live, you just exist. You’re never happy, you just smile. I don’t know how to help you. I don’t know what to give you anymore. I don’t know what you want from me, our marriage, or life.

When I first read the letter, I laughed. It seemed so cliche and over-the-top. As if Sandra were just exercising her creative muscles. Trying to get back into her writing habits. Then, I noticed the missing luggage from beneath the bed. That her side of the closet was empty.

When I read her letter a second time, my heart began to swell with heat. Liquid magma boiled in my veins. The letter was the most childish thing I could think of. We were in our late twenties, supposedly adults. We were meant to talk out our issues. Communicate with each other. Running away was the coward’s option.

When I read her letter the third and final time, I wondered if she left because of me or herself. Perhaps a combination of the two.

Sandra was too young for a midlife crisis. Too smart for irrationality. Too confident for indecisiveness. This choice wasn’t some meager break to distance herself and collect her thoughts. It was a plan. One she intended to see through, and if I gave her enough time, she’d never come back. She’d probably never contact me, aside from divorce papers in the mail.

So, I collected the bare necessities and left the apartment. I got into my car and began the trip to her mother’s house about seven hours from the city. All the while, calling only to receive her voicemail. Sending text messages with no replies. I even tried her mother’s number, and of course, no answer.

About four hours into my drive, exhaustion weighed on my eyelids and blurred my vision. The highway swirled with a mixture of tail lights and traffic cones from the intermittent construction. My stomach constricted with hunger, and my thoughts were faint whispers at the back of my mind.

The preliminary tide of anger and turmoil could no longer fuel me as it had in the beginning. Not even a fair dose of nicotine from my Viceroy cigarettes would keep me alert. Instead, they made my head pound and my throat sore.

Approaching the next exit, I took the offramp into a small podunk town perimetered on one side by a sprawling cornfield. According to the GPS, it consisted of two bars, three gas stations, and five restaurants. All of which, aside from the bars, were closed. Luckily, there was also a motel just off the highway.

I stopped at the gas station to refuel and use the restroom. The warmers were picked clean, save a few slices of greasy pizza with cheese redolent of a dry sponge. My stomach said, screw it, you’ve eaten worse. The last thing I wanted was to spend the rest of my night going in and out of the bathroom. Opting out, I grabbed a prepackaged salad and beef jerky instead.

The cashier, a young woman with a constellation of pimples, rang me up. “19.25 including gas.”

While we waited for the machine to register my card, the woman stared at me with a cloudy gaze. Vacant of emotion or scrutiny. The kind you find on a corpse.

The card reader beeped and printed out a receipt. The woman handed it to me and said dully, “Have a good night.”

“Yeah, you too.”

Back in my car, I drove down the road to the local motel and stopped in the main office. The man behind the counter was plump with a receding hairline. His expression was very much the same as I’d encountered at the gas station.

Without looking away from his phone, he asked, “Checking in or checking out?”

“Checking in,” I said.

“You want a single or double?”

“Single, please.”

He swiped my card and slid a guestbook across the counter. I quickly signed my name: Eliot Bierce. With my job, this was sheer muscle memory. As easy as putting on a pair of socks.

He returned my card and handed me a key to room 10. Outside again, I retrieved my overnight bag from the back seat. As I walked to my room, an RV pulled into the parking lot. It squealed to a halt across the way, taking up about four different spots. The headlights died, and five men stepped out.

They were all tall with gaunt frames, their gaits stiff and awkward. Pale skin further whitened by the moonlight.

The first off the RV was dressed in a sweater vest with wrinkled khaki pants. On his face was a pair of wiry spectacles, and instantly, I was reminded of my high school librarian.

Behind him was a man in a leather jacket and denim jeans with a bandana wrapped around his head. A biker of sorts.

The next was grease-stained with short black hair. His jumpsuit was a dark blue like that of a mechanic, and this seemed an apt label as he rounded the RV, opening the hood to peer at the machinery beneath.

The fourth carried a canvas chair and plopped down beside the door. His clothes were baggy and unwashed. While too far away for me to smell, my mind conjured mildew and cheap weed. The Stoner lit a cigarette and reclined in his seat. His head fell back as he gazed up at the stars, but his expression remained wooden. Taut with indifference.

The last of the men continued across the parking lot towards the main office. He wore a black suit with a collared shirt beneath. His tie hung askew from his neck, creased with wrinkles.

When we crossed paths, I nodded in greeting. He simply stopped and stared, assessing me with little interest. His jaw was sharp, his face handsome, but emotionless. Shadows clung to the hollows of his cheeks and accentuated his sunken eyes.

Waiting for the man to speak, I reached into my pocket and withdrew another cigarette. The lighter snapped a flame, and the man reeled back from me, his lips curving into a thin smile.

“Those things will kill you,” he said in a monotonous voice. As if he were reading lines from a cue card.

I gestured to the Stoner in his canvas chair. “Maybe you should tell your friend then.”

“He’s well-aware.”

The man continued to the office, and I went inside my room. Turning on the nightstand lamp, I set my bag on the bed and removed my laptop. While I waited for it to boot up, I changed into a pair of checkered pajama bottoms and a white T-shirt. I called Sandra again but got her voicemail.

Go figure, I thought.

On my laptop, I logged into my work account to check my claims. It was Friday night, and while the pencil-pushing bureaucrats at the office preferred minimal overtime, I hated leaving caseloads to sit over the weekend. I was already at max capacity and then some. Next week, I’d probably get just as many claims plus my overdo ones.

No rest for the wicked, and no sleep for the virtuous. Society is a tired entity full of insomniac husks.

While finishing a few rejection letters and poking at my soggy salad, my phone started ringing. The high-pitched chirp that usually filled me with undeterrable dread suddenly made my heart pound against my chest. I quickly snatched up the phone and answered, “Sandra?”

“Sorry, man, just me.” It was my colleague and only friend, Thomas. “No luck yet?”

“Not a peep.”

“Shit, sounds rough.” He offered an amicable laugh for all my grief. “Don’t worry, she’ll come around. Just going through a phase, I’m sure.”

“Yeah, maybe.”

I’d texted Thomas at some point between my second and third read of Sandra’s letter. While I didn't specify its contents to him, he got the gist of it: she was gone with little intent of returning. But Thomas was something of an optimist. The kind of guy who shrugged at his workload and told the boss “yes” even if “yes” wasn’t always plausible.

“Don’t beat yourself up,” Thomas said. “You’ve gotta get out of the house. Keep yourself distracted.” He idled a moment before adding, “It’s still early enough. Why don’t you come to Ambrose’s Tavern? We’ll have a couple rounds and—”

“Unlikely,” I interjected. “I’m about four hours out?”

He paused and laughed again. “You’re going after her?”

“What else am I supposed to do?”

“Wait, right? Didn’t she leave a note—”

“Trust me, Sandra doesn’t do breaks. She’s either in or out. No in between. If I just wait around, she won’t come back.”

That’s the way she’d been since we first met at university. Half her grades were barely passing, while the rest were perfect. As if she walked into a classroom and flipped a coin to decide how much effort she’d put in.

“I hate to be that guy,” Thomas said, “but if you love something, you’ve gotta let it go.”

“Thanks, Livingston. Glad to see that English major is doing you some good.”

“Really, though, what do you expect? If I were you, I’d just take this time to focus on me.”

Hard to achieve when, according to Sandra, all I ever did was focus on myself. And even if I did solely focus on myself in some desperate attempt to improve my life and personality, what good would that do? What the hell would I gain by going to a yoga class or changing my diet or attending therapy? I’d still be at the same job, living in the same apartment, embedded with the same goals.

What I had to do was convince Sandra to come back. But as that dawned on me, I wondered what the incentive was to that? What catharsis would that bring me to drag her back home to a life she clearly didn’t want anymore?

While I didn’t have an answer, I also didn’t have a reason to stop either. My plan remained the same: in the morning, I would check out and finish my drive. I’d get to her mother’s house, knock on the door, and sit down at that dingy table in the kitchen nook with a cup of burnt coffee, trying to sort out this mess. All the while, watching the clock, counting the seconds until one of us conceded to the other. Then, the long drive back home, getting in late, going to bed, and waking up Sunday with nothing but dread for Monday morning.

“Find a hobby,” Thomas suggested. “Football or baking or knitting or something, man.”

“I don’t have time for a hobby.”

I’ve always been hyper-focused. Ever since I was a kid. Find something to sink all your time and effort into, and put on the blinders for everything else.

Before Thomas could counter, music blared from outside my room. Muffled against the thin drywall. Shaking the windows in their frames.

“Christ,” I muttered. “Hey, I’ll call you back tomorrow.”

“I’m telling ya, just head home. If she comes back, she comes back. If she doesn’t, you’ll figure it out.”

I hung up the phone and tossed it onto the mattress. Then, I climbed off the bed and peered out the window. The RV vagabonds were partying in the parking lot, if that’s what you wanted to call it.

They had a speaker blasting today’s hits and sat in a circle around it. They drank beers from bottles without labels. Passed around what I thought was the stoner’s cigarette, but then, I realized it was just a vape designed to look like a cigarette. Smoke wafted from their wide maws, billowing into the night sky.

In spite of the makings for a good time, they seemed almost bored. Their conversations were short and abrupt. Coming and going like customers at a fast food joint. In and out, replaced by another within seconds flat.

I stifled a growl between gritted teeth and stepped outside. Like an old crotchety neighbor in my pajamas, I walked up to the group of vagabonds. Before I could get within five feet of them, the Biker jumped up from his seat and had a hand on my chest.

The man in the suit, the Entrepreneur, turned down the music and said, “It’s alright. Let him through.”

The Biker carefully backed away, his shadowy eyes following me as I continued towards them. All heads turned, brows furrowed, lips taut, eyes black and beady. Their faces seemed to sag with discontent. Foreheads lined by leather grooves of tanned flesh.

“Help you with something, friend?” the Entrepreneur asked.

“It’s a little late,” I said, suppressing my annoyance. “Mind keeping the music down?”

He looked around at the others and back at me. “Is it loud?”

“What do you think?”

The Entrepreneur grinned. The rest followed suit, shaking with mirth at my plight. One big joke that I wasn’t a part of.

“We offer our deepest condolences,” he said. “Our festivities tend to get out of hand. We’ll do our best to accommodate you.”

The fuck does that mean? I thought, shaking my head. “Just, keep it down, please.”

Returning to my room, I slammed the door and locked it. Outside, silence permeated to an unnerving degree. Without the music or occasional chatter, it seemed the world was empty. For some reason, a sixth instinct of sorts, I parted the blinds and looked out into the parking lot.

All the vagabonds were seated, watching my room with their blank stares. Contemplating my presence, clearly upset about my intrusion.

I dropped the curtain, letting it fall back into place, and backed away from the window. My bowel constricted with unease. Budding fear for my situation: out in the middle of nowhere with five angry men outside my room. The only thing between us was a flimsy door with one lock.

This isn’t the 80s, I told myself.

People are, and always have been, crazy to some degree. Bloodhungry and viscous with fragile egos that teetered like a pendulum. Swing to the left, and they contained their animalistic urges. Swing to the right, and they might club you to death with the nearest stone. All it takes to get that pendulum swinging is a little push.

But modern technology, updated security, seemed to pacify this madness. Not because we were suddenly civilized, but rather, because we were afraid. We were always being monitored and scrutinized. Shackled by the threat of punishment with little hope of escape.

I went back to my laptop and picked up where I left off. Within ten minutes, I decided to log off. Not because I’d finished with my work. I was just too tired and nervous to continue without making some mistake that would have to be resolved Monday morning.

So, I packed my laptop and shuffled through my bag. All I’d brought were clothes for tomorrow, my toothbrush and toothpaste, a can of antiperspirant, my wallet, and keys. Furtively, I wished I’d grabbed Sandra’s stun gun or my father’s hunting knife. Something to defend myself with, but in a situation like that, do you really expect to encounter danger other than that of what you bring onto yourself?

Quit being so paranoid, I thought, settling beneath the sheets. I turned off the nightstand lamp and laid in the dark, staring at the popcorn-textured ceiling, watching shadows shift like an inkblot test.

Sleep refused to come though. My mind was burnt and tired, but my body was very much alive. Reignited by a slight kick of adrenaline, further kindled by my nerves. I kept glancing at the door, waiting for it to kick in. Waiting for one of the vagabonds to drag me out into the night and introduce me to their boot heel.

The Librarian and the Stoner didn’t seem likely to oblige. The Biker or Mechanic, though, were my most probable culprits.

What is a group like that doing together anyway, I wondered. The Village People went out of style in the late 80s.

Despite my anxiety, this made me laugh. It felt good. I couldn’t remember the last time I’d actually been amused by the world instead of annoyed. The last time I wasn’t on edge, my personal pendulum one bad day from swinging the opposite direction.

That’s when the music started again. Louder than before. The vibrations shivering through the floor, through the bedframe, and across the mattress. I closed my eyes and sighed. And suddenly, I understood their little joke. Their watchful gazes. Lure me into a false sense of peace and quiet before trying to blow the doors off.

Maybe if you had a better personality, I argued with myself, scoffing at the internal beratement of my conscience. Better personality? What personality do I even have?

The music persisted, as did their voices, but I couldn’t make out the specifics of what they were saying. This time, I turned over in bed and sandwiched my head between two pillows. I didn’t even care whether they were clean or not. I just wanted a little silence.

A few minutes passed, and my patience extinguished like the wispy flame of a candle. I retrieved the handheld phone from its cradle on the nightstand and dialed the front desk. It rang a few times before clicking.

“Hello?” the man at the front desk said. “Can I help you?”

“Hi, yeah, I want to lodge a complaint against some of the guests in the parking lot.”

There was a soft groan. “Okay, what’s the issue?”

I told him about the music, wondering if he was so distracted by his phone that he couldn’t hear it. More than likely, he just didn’t give a shit. Minimum wage and overnight hours. At that point, you only get worked up when your life's on the line.

Once I finished explaining the situation, the front desk clerk said, “Alright, I’ll see what I can do.”

I hung up the phone and waited, counting every second until the music stopped. Then, I heard the voices. Toneless. Every word a chore.

The conversation carried on longer than I would’ve imagined. So, I snuck out of bed and over to the window, watching the desk clerk move his hands around as he spoke. The vagabonds, aside from the Entrepreneur, were motionless. They gazed at the clerk with hawk-like tendencies. A predator inspecting prey. Considering the hunt, the repercussions that lay in wait.

The Entrepreneur stood from his chair and placed a hand on the clerk’s back. His voice faded as he led the man through the parking lot to the RV. They entered, and after a few moments, the rest of the vagabonds stood. One by one, they filed inside, closing the door behind them.

What the hell are you doing? I thought.

I waited and waited, but none of them returned. Then, my curiosity getting the best of me, I unlocked the door and snuck outside. Sticking to the shadows, I crept through the parking lot and pressed against the side of the RV.

The air around it was acrid. Rot and decay combated by an overwhelming rank of air fresheners. The little pine tree cutouts you hang around your rearview mirror. But there was no sound. No voices, no shifting feet, nothing.

Don’t be an idiot, I thought. Just go back to your room.

Instead, I inched along the length of the RV and stood on my tiptoes, looking through the back window. Blinds cut the scene into narrow slits, but through the gaps between, I saw the inside of the RV.

Wood panel floors mottled by splotches of dried blood. Walls draped with naked bodies. Upon closer inspection, I realized they weren’t necessarily bodies. Rather, the hollow skin suits of people, strewn up like clothes on a hanger. Flies and gnats swirled around them.

The vagabonds were in the kitchen-lounge area, standing around the desk clerk’s body. His throat was carved with a bleeding gash, and his limbs twitched with the remnants of fading life. The Entrepreneur held a sickle in his right hand, the blade tarnished by spots of rust. The Stoner smoked his vape, and the Librarian adjusted his spectacles.

None of them exhibited any sense of worry or concern. They looked at the clerk the way you might a piece of moldy cheese baked into the sidewalk: slight disgust at its current state, and a hint of irritation because you accidentally stepped on it.

The Entrepreneur turned to address the others, and I shrank away from the window, breath caught in my lungs, already trying to recall those last few seconds. Trying to discern if I’d been spotted or not.

I lingered a moment longer. If they saw me, they’d storm out of the RV to seize me. But the door remained closed. Although the RV began to shake as they moved around inside.

Quickly, I skirted across the parking lot, back into my room. I closed the door behind me, locked it, and retrieved my phone. The line was ringing before I even realized I’d dialed 911. The dispatcher answered. Everything came fumbling out of my mouth. What had happened, my current location, description of the suspects, my name and number.

“Okay…we’ll send a cruiser over,” the dispatcher replied flatly.

“This isn’t a joke,” I reported.

“Sir, please don’t take that tone with me. I never accused you of—”

Please forgive a hopeless romantic but for me this lets me go back and watch Season 1. 

  
Once Upon a Time in Montana ONCE UPON A TIME IN MONTANA A Reimagined Ending to \*1923\* 

Written by: \[Your Name Here\]-- \*\*NOTE:\*\* This story diverges from the Paramount+ series \*1923\* during Episode 6, offering a more emotionally satisfying and character-driven conclusion, especially for fans of Spencer and Alexandra.-- 

\*\*SCENE 1: The Gas Station\*\* A snowstorm threatens. Alexandra, Paul, and Hillary take shelter at a rural gas station rather than pushing into danger. The matron warns them off traveling further. They stay the night, warm and safe. Alexandra wires ahead, hoping Spencer will find her.-- 

\*\*SCENE 2: Stop the Train\*\* At a nearby depot, Alexandra pulls in with Paul and Hillary. The train is pulling out! and Spencer is aboard. He sees her through the window, mirroring the Season 1 moment where she once chased after him. Spencer yells, ""Stop the train!"" and the friendly railroad attendant does just that. Spencer leaps from the last car and they rush into each others arms. Both are crying. Page 1 Once Upon a Time in Montana-- 

\*\*SCENE 3: The Train Cabin\*\* Spencer and Alexandra share a private moment in the sleeper car. She tells him she's pregnant. They speak of surviving, of starting again. Alexandra shows him the a couple of wadded bills and some silver change. The tips she retrieved -- the last of her money, now a talisman of her journey. ""I will never spend this."" That night, after Alexandra has fallen asleep against his chest, she startles awake. Breathing hard, eyes wide. \*\*ALEXANDRA\*\* I had a nightmare. \*\*SPENCER\*\* What happened? \*\*ALEXANDRA\*\* It was horrible. I was cold I lost you. And I was alone in the snow they died. Paul and Hillary. I was screaming your name. My hands and feet, they were so cold! \*Spencers face hardens. Not with disbelief -- with recognition.\* \*\*SPENCER\*\* I had the same dream. Page 2 Once Upon a Time in Montana \*They stare at each other, shaken. Then she lays her head on his chest again. He wraps his arms around her. The nightmare is past. They are here. Together.\*-- 

\*\*SCENE 4: The Ambush\*\* As they arrive in Montana, Spencer is ambushed at the train station by men sent by Donald Whitfield. He kills two with his Holland & Holland rifle and finishes the fight with his Colt pistol. Alexandra, hiding in the sleeper, witnesses it all. She's unhurt.-- 

\*\*SCENE 5: Riders from the Ranch\*\* Yellowstone Ranch hands and a still alive Jack arrive at the tail end of the fight. They tell Spencer that the ranch is under siege. Spencer asks Alex if she can ride. She just laughs, ""I have been riding to hounds since I was child!"" Spencer and Alexandra mount up for the ride to Yellowstone. Alex IS an excellent rider. (Julia didnt go to Cowboy Camp for nothing!)-- 

\*\*SCENE 6: The Siege (Summary)\*\* The ranch battle plays out similarly to the original series. Spencer fights alongside Jacob, Jack, Zane, and the others. All major characters survive. The Duttons hold the ranch. 

Page 3 Once Upon a Time in Montana-- 

\*\*SCENE 7: Alexandra and Cara\*\* After the siege, Alexandra meets Cara in the ranch house. She gives Cara the letters Spencer had written. They share a quiet, emotional exchange. Two strong women who carried their men through war and distance now recognize each other as kindred spirits.-- 

\*\*SCENE 8: Spencer and Zane\*\* Spencer thanks Zane for holding the line. ""If it weren\`t for you, this house would\`ve been ashes.""-- 

\*\*SCENE 9: Spencer and Jacob\*\* They family and the cowboys share a meal. Jacob tells Spencer of what all has transpired. He tells him how his brother John was killed by Creighton and all that Whitfield has done. Spencer pushes his plate away. ""Lets mount up.""-- 

\*\*SCENE 10: Banner Creighton\*\* Spencer confronts and escaping Banner just outside of Whitfield Estate. He fires a round inches from  Banner's head. ""The only reason Im not killing you is because Im a soldier, not a murderer. Go to your family. Leave this place. Don\`t come back -- or I might think better of it.""-- 

\*\*SCENE 11: Whitfields Estate\*\* Spencer storms Whitfields mansion. He confronts him and the two prostitutes -- one of whom murdered a girl. A new girl with bruises is asked if she wants to stay. She says, ""No."" Spencer tells her to leave. He uses the Holland & Holland. One round to the chest. Whitfield is thrown back, killed instantly. The sadistic prostitute is also executed. Spencer and Alexandra close the door on that chapter.-- The next few months on the Yellowstone Ranch are happy ones. 



\*\*EPILOGUE: In fall after baby John is born, Alexandra talks Spencer into accepting the invitation to go to Washington D.C. to receive the Medal of Honor from the President. They travel by train to Chicago and then New York.-- 

\*\*EPILOGUE: CHICAGO\*\* \*\*Scene: Bernard Anthony\*\* (the man on the train) 

Alex has told Spencer about the man on the train. As she did not stay to testify and the man was very wealthy, he walked away with only the beating he got with the coffee pot. With help from Paul and Hillary, they find the mans name and track him down. Spencer walks into a gentlemans club where Anthony is making life hard on a waitress. Alex and Spencer confront him and Spencer crushes Bernard Anthonys right hand against a table. ""Youll never touch another woman with that hand again.""-- 

\*\*EPILOGUE: NEW YORK\*\* \*\*Scene: Grand Central Station\*\* They arrive and by chance, Alexandra gasps as she sees the man who beat and robbed her. Hes still preying on women. Spencer sets a trap. As the man follows Alex toward the same restroom he once dragged her into, Spencer appears behind him. ""You remember her?"" he asks the man. He beats the man to within an inch of his life. Alex asks him what he did with the bracelet he stole from her. Spencer leaves him alive, broken, and terrified.-- \*\*Scene: Pawn Shop\*\* They retrieve Alexandras bracelet -- a gift from her friend Jennifer, pawned by the thief.-- 

Page 6 Once Upon a Time in Montana 

\*\*FINAL SCENE: WASHINGTON, D.C.\*\* \*\*Scene: The Medal\*\* On the White House lawn, President Calvin Coolidge places the Medal of Honor around Spencers neck using the ceremonial neck ribbon. Alexandra holds their baby, her friend Jennifer beside her. The British Ambassador recognizes Alexandra: ""Countess of Sussex?"" -- ""Not anymore. Just Mrs. Dutton."" Later, they stand in the gardens. ""You all right?"" Spencer asks. ""Perfect,"" Alexandra says. ""Ready to go home?"" He nods. \*Fade to black.",11,1747860991.0,1923Series,1,1.0,False

Out of a sudden, I started flirting and chatting with my colleague (yes, I know, not recommended and there is a VERY GOOD reason why). He invited me to his place, cooked dinner, mixed some cocktails and not-surprisingly ended in bed. It was going on over and over again (plus meetings without bed stuff) a month.Once he even asked me to stay overnight even though I know he never does it for other women (he told me this before our affair). It was not only about sex and bdsm, we always laughed a lot (still true), had many topics to discuss, also private things he had never told anyone before, etc. After the month, he went to study abroad for three weeks. Before he left, we agreed that once he is back, we will do this and that, go there and there, try this and this. When he was away we chatted via phone, updating ourselves what is going on. Once he was back, we were chatting again and I told him I miss our moments, but not only THAT, the whole package. He told me it is nice but he has his mind elsewhere (and you have to have a clear mind especially for bdsm stuff), he wants to buy a flat, wants to change a job (I know this is true, because I was his advisor with  flats later, so it was not only an excuse) that he is on a crossroad in his life. I accepted it, it was painful but you cannot force anyone to do things they are not ready for, but he reaches out to me very often. Always writing, chatting, etc. When he came from his parent´s place who gave him a hell of food, he invited me to his place to eat it, then we walked and went for coffee and then for beer. Or I invited him to my place, eating, drinking, watching a movie. Or I ´´babysitted´´ his dog,or we were selecting a winter coat for him together, then he asked me to do some art stuff for him,etc. And it is even ´´worse´´ in the office. We sit together with another five guys (we are more family than colleagues) and he is every day like X,X,X,X (X my name), come here and sit close to me, or X let´s make a coffe, or X help me with this, or he is just saying my name. When we are in our kitchenette, he is always next to me. Last time, we were in a cottage (with the rest of our work gang), he was playing at and instrument, touching his knee to mine. I see (peripherally and by 6th sense) him looking at me very often when I do not look at him or mirroring my moves (e.g. when I dance while sitting).  
So basically, it is very similar to what we had before we left, just without sex and bdsm stuff.

My question is, have you ever had a similar relationship? If yes, how did it go?How did it end up? What do you think of my stuff? Does he have a crush on me?Or what on Earth is going on here in your opinion? I am very confused and dont know what to do. Yes, the best option would be asking him, but I am afraid of his answer and losing him.

Thank you,

*A dark folktale of longing, bloom, and shadowed forests*  
**By Rowan Graves**

---

All Mara ever wanted to be was a mother. For as long as she could remember, it wasn’t just a dream—it was part of her.  
Baby showers sparked a fire in her belly. Tiny socks and soft cotton onesies filled her chest with heavy longing. She already had a nursery set up in her small home. *Just in case.*

But the right man never came—she worried he never would.  
As the years passed, the hope began to sour into fear. *What if she was never chosen? What if she missed her chance?*

Then, one morning on the way to work, she saw it.  
**Sunshine Grove Fertility.**

Mara’s heart surged. The sign was cheerful, hanging beneath a carved wooden sunflower. It felt like fate. At lunch, she called to make an appointment, half-expecting them to push her to the bottom of the list—single, childless, not part of a “real” family.

But the woman on the line didn’t hesitate.  
*“We’d love to help you grow your garden,”* she said sweetly. *“We have an opening next Thursday.”*

All week, Mara daydreamed of growing a child of her own—someone to raise and shape. To hold. To love.  
The kind of love that came from bringing a piece of yourself into the world.

---

**Thursday arrived like a dream.**  
Sunshine Grove was every bit as perfect as she’d imagined: warm and farmhouse-like, with pale yellow siding, white shutters, and window boxes overflowing with violets and creeping thyme.

The sign on the porch read:  
***“At Sunshine Grove, we help you nurture your garden…and grow your family.”***

Mara had butterflies in her stomach. She stepped inside, inhaling the scent of fresh coffee and lavender. The lobby was all soft pastels, overstuffed chairs, and soothing lullabies.

At the desk sat an old woman with a halo of white hair and a storybook smile. She looked up and said gently,  
*“You must be Mara. We’ve been expecting you.”*

Mara was smiling so hard her face hurt as she filled out the paperwork. As she waited for her name to be called, she began to daydream—tiny hands, tiny voice saying *mama*, pitter-patter of little feet.

She was so deliriously happy that she didn’t see it—the waiting room was empty. No other patients, or families were there. The phone didn’t ring, and the nurse wasn’t filing paperwork—just **staring at Mara**.

The nurse’s eyes didn’t waver. Blue, pale as milk glass, unblinking.

Mara glanced up from her clipboard, the smile still half-formed on her lips.  
*“Everything okay?”* she asked, a nervous laugh tucked beneath the question.

The nurse’s lips curved gently.  
*“You’re glowing,”* she said softly, like it wasn’t a compliment—but a **confirmation**.

*“Oh.”* Mara flushed, unsure how to respond. *“Thank you—I guess I’m just… really excited.”*

The nurse finally looked away, down at the clipboard Mara handed over. Her fingers were cool and dry as paper.  
*“We’ll be ready for you shortly,”* she murmured.

Mara settled back into her seat, watching the hallway that led deeper into the building. There were no doors marked with names. No chime of phones, no whispers behind closed exam rooms. Just the soft, looping lullaby overhead.

---

Everything went as planned—and faster than she expected.  
Mara met the doctor, picked a donor, did a couple tests. Within a few minutes the doctor told her she was ready for implantation—**today**!

She thanked the doctor and the sweet nurse. She left feeling like she was floating, rubbing her belly and making plans.

In a few weeks she tested—**two pink lines showed up in seconds!**  
Mara was going to be a mom, finally.

---

The first few months were rough. Morning sickness wracked her body. Only rare steak stayed down—so raw it practically bled on the plate. She lost so much weight she went to the clinic to make sure her baby was okay.

The nurse reassured her—everything was fine. Baby was growing, and healthy. The doctor gave her a medicine—it came in a green tincture bottle.

*“Two drops a day,”* she said. When Mara made a face, she added, *“It’s herbal. Grown in our garden. For difficult pregnancies.”*

---

The second trimester was wonderful. The baby moved and those butterfly kicks were perfect.  
She could finally eat more than just steak, and her bump had finally popped. Everyone knew she was pregnant. Mara felt blissful.

Her nursery room had taken shape—forest themed. It had diapers, toys, blankets, mommy and me outfits, and even a mobile with forest critters.

---

The third trimester was almost perfect. The baby moved regularly. Footprints on her belly. Little hands pushing at her side.  
The butterflies had turned into rapids as her due date approached.

---

**The night she went into labor was stormy.**  
Thunder roared. Lightning crashed.

Sunshine Grove had sent their midwife so Mara could have a home birth—just as she’d planned.

The midwife arrived in green scrubs, with lush golden hair and kind lavender eyes. A sunflower tattoo on her forearm. When lightning struck behind her, Mara could’ve sworn—*she saw wings.*

*“I’m Thaleia,”* her voice was soothing, melodic. *“Sunshine Grove wants you to be comfortable and cared for.”*

Thaleia lit candles and opened curtains. The storm raged, and she just hummed a lullaby.

*“You’ve done so well,”* the nurse said, feeling Mara’s belly.  
*“He’s growing strong. Eager.”*

---

Labor gripped Mara like twisting roots. Each contraction dragged through her like something ancient pulling free—thorns tearing, vines coiling tight around her spine and thighs. With every push they pulled at her core, like she wasn’t giving birth—it was **clawing its way out**.

The storm crescendoed. Branches cracked. Windows rattled.

As her child crowned, the lights flickered—**darkness engulfed the living room.** Only the candles remained. Tiny stars to witness his arrival.

Then he came—**wailing his presence to the world.**  
The candles flared green, then snuffed out.

Thaleia cleaned him and wrapped him in a soft forest green muslin blanket. She handed him to Mara, her lavender eyes full of warmth… and something unreadable.

*“What a wild garden you’ve grown,”* Thaleia whispered, brushing the baby’s cheek. *“So full of promise… and teeth.”*

Mara didn’t understand.  
And she didn’t care.  
Her baby was here. He was perfect.

Ten fingers. Ten toes. A mop of dark curly hair and moss-colored eyes that opened *immediately*—and stared straight into hers.

Mara wept, exhausted and overflowing with joy. For the first time in her life, she felt whole.

---

But the days and months that followed… were strange.

Her son didn’t cry—not even once.  
He watched everything—eyes full of strange understanding.

The animals came first.  
Raccoons huddled on the porch like pilgrims.  
Birds slammed into the nursery window.  
A fox sat at the back door one night, staring in—*its eyes full of worship.*

---

The yard bloomed wildly. Flowers Mara had never planted burst into bloom. Ivy climbed the nursery wall.  
When her son started babbling, it wasn’t *mama*—it was a language she didn’t know. Something deep and green and *wrong*.

At night, she found him sitting in his crib, staring at her.  
Talking.  
Eyes glowing faintly.

---

She tried to tell herself it wasn’t real.  
Babies don’t speak ancient languages.  
Their eyes don’t glow.  
Wild animals don’t worship your child.

Then one night she woke to an empty crib.  
Panic gripped her.

She searched the house.  
She heard his voice—*calling her from every room.*

Then she heard laughter—sweet and drifting from above.  
She looked up.

He was crawling across the ceiling, giggling.

---

Mara doesn’t sleep much now.

Once, in desperation, she tried to return to Sunshine Grove.

But it was gone.  
No cheerful sign. No pastel walls.  
Just a **rotting building**. Roof caved in. Windows broken.

Inside, vines choked the furniture. The walls were carved with runes and spirals.  
Half-buried in the dirt, she found the old sign:

**“We help you nurture your garden… and grow your family.”**

---

Now, she and her son live in a cottage deep in the woods.  
He is happier.  
The forest is happier.  
Mara doesn’t sleep much anymore.

He sings.

We purchased a Brevilla BE a few months ago and have been trying to learn more about using it, and I'm worried that I'm doing something wrong. I've watched videos, read guides and browsed Reddit.. surely it must be me that's doing something wrong, or my expectations are wrong. I've included my BE settings below, and have attached some images of my results and timing in hopes of finding a solution. Extraction (when espresso begins to fall) starts at about 11 seconds, but the entire process (when the needle finally clicks off to zero pressure) takes about 28.71 seconds. Ultimately, the drink (espresso and oatmilk, warmed for about 30 seconds to a minute, depending upon how hot the metal pouring cup gets to my hands) tasted bland and just.. hot, no flavor. Its actually borderline bad. The taste of the espresso when it came out of the BE was insanely bitter or sour, I'm not actually what the difference is, but I definitely did not like it.

I love coffee, especially dirty chais lattes and the usual, so I am open for critiques, comments and critisms as long as its constructive. I attempted to remain concise, and am happy to answer questions. Thank you kindly people of [r/espresso](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/).

I couldn’t handle it anymore—the disrespect, the dismissiveness from my manager. I originally wanted to submit a two weeks’ notice, but after everything that happened this morning, I just couldn’t do it.

Here’s what happened:

I clocked in, said good morning to everyone, and went straight to the front register. I asked my manager for updates on my onboarding and paycheck issue. She said “No..I haven’t fixed it yet. I’ll call them tomorrow” so in that moment I thought, yeah your vacation starts tomorrow. I highly doubt you’ll actually give them a call. 

So I guess I’ll have to talk to her boss myself because this is getting ridiculous. Anyway, it was a slow morning, so I figured I’d start brewing coffee—I didn’t want my manager accusing me of being lazy, especially since we were short on brewed coffee. While doing that, I asked her if I should brew dark roast since we were out. She said no and told me to make blonde roast first, so I said okay.

Then I noticed one of the coffee containers was empty. I thought, “Maybe I should ask if I need to refill it—just in case—because we only have one coffee brewing.” My manager was in the back talking with the inspector, so I decided to ask my coworker instead. He was standing right next to me and wasn’t busy, plus he has more experience and I trust his judgment. He told me to go ahead and brew the dark roast, and later make more Pike Place. So, I did.

Moments later, my manager saw me making the coffee and immediately got annoyed. I looked at my coworker, confused, and even he looked confused too. He tried to defend me, saying he told me to do it, but she completely dismissed him and just focused on me—because I was the one who physically made it.

I almost lost it. Why was she treating me like I had years of experience? I’m still training, for God’s sake! And I asked for advice—I didn’t just do it on my own. Why is all the blame on me?

After she walked away, my coworker apologized. He said that’s how he’s been doing things this whole time, but maybe they changed the procedure recently. I told him not to worry and that mistakes happen. I could tell he felt bad.

Later, when it was slow again, I asked my manager if she needed help with anything—again, trying to avoid being seen as slacking. She told me to make whipped cream since we were out. I said, “Okay, sounds like fun! One question though… can you help me make it?” That really seemed to piss her off. She said, “Did [coworker’s name] not teach you how to make whipped cream??” I replied, “Umm… no? But I’m a hands-on learner and I pick things up fast—I got this!”

She sighed and told me what to grab, then left me to it. And I was right! Lmao. I picked it up quickly and didn’t need her help. But as I was making the whipped cream, customers started coming in. I was the only one available to take orders, so I was doing multiple things at once: taking orders, warming food, and making seven bottles of whipped cream.

At one point, she messed up one of the bottles and I had to clean up her mess. While I was doing that, she came over, visibly annoyed, and said, “You’re taking too long to make the whipped cream. It shouldn’t take you 30 minutes.” In my head I thought, It’s been less than 30 minutes… and I’m multitasking alone.

Unfortunately everything fell on me. I tried to stay calm and professional, but her passive-aggressiveness almost made me cry. Once again, she said I was too slow and not doing enough. Then she told me, “Take your 10, please.”

So I went to the back and called my boyfriend. I was this close to walking out. I stayed back there longer than I should’ve about 15 minutes but I was emotionally drained, and it was still slow. I made sure to keep an eye on the cameras so I could return to the floor if a customer came in.

When I returned, my trainer approached me and said, “Hey, can I talk to you for a bit?” I said sure. He’s a really nice and empathetic guy. I guess he saw how my manager had been treating me and wanted to check in. I told him everything—how I haven’t gotten my first paycheck, how I’m still not in the system, and how my manager has been treating me.

I could tell he felt bad for me. He gave me encouragement and support, and advised me to just walk out and not waste another minute of my time there. He was genuinely supportive. I thanked him for his kindness and patience. I even apologized for not meeting my manager’s unrealistic expectations, but he told me I did my best and that’s all that matters. After all, it’s just a Starbucks job. I really wanted to stay a little longer just to finish my shift, but what’s the point.. my manager isn’t going to teach me how to make drinks and she’s just continue picking on me. He asked me if I got my tips from yesterday and I said no. I’ve never received my tips since I first started working, his eyes widened. So he went back to the bar, came back, and gave me my tips + extra. That was really nice of him. He then gave me a hug and wished me the best of luck. I really needed that.

1ks8fou,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1ks8fou/ceo_teslon_spuskx_the_accidental_emperor/,CEO Teslon SpuskX - The Accidental Emperor,"Humans are the only species in the galaxy who can bend the rules without breaking them.

Those words echoed through the minds of countless beings in the Galactic Empire, most of whom had no idea who had uttered them. But they were about to find out. They would see, firsthand, how humans could turn bureaucratic absurdity into a weapon.

And it all started with a single, absurd stunt.

Teslon SpuskX, eccentric CEO of SpuskX Interstellar, was not the kind of man who thought things through. His latest idea was, in a word, reckless. He'd been looking for a way to make the next big splash, the one that would turn the company into a household name, or at least into something more than a quirky startup trying to make its way in the crowded interstellar market.

His plan? Send a rocket into the restricted quadrant of the galaxy, the same quadrant that had been declared off-limits by the Galactic Empire eons ago. They'd stamped it with a No Entry sign, but for SpuskX, that was just an invitation. He thought it would make for an unforgettable livestream, something the public couldn’t ignore.

And so, on a day like any other, a rocket launched, soaring into the depths of forbidden space. The crowd watching on screens across the galaxy went wild. They were all there, in front of their screens, eagerly anticipating whatever wild spectacle Teslon had promised.

The problem was, Teslon hadn't read the fine print, none of the fine print, really. Galactic law was an ocean of rules, regulations, and archaic edicts that few even bothered to keep track of. After all, who cared about a law passed 9,000 years ago when it was clearly forgotten by the rest of the galaxy?

Well, someone did. And they worked at the Department of Galactic Empires (DGE).

A few days after the stunt, Teslon was relaxing in his office, reading reports on his profits. His communications console blinked to life, and the screen filled with a face he didn’t recognize, a grey-skinned alien with antennae twitching in annoyance.

This is an official communication from the Department of Galactic Empires, the alien said. You are in violation of Galactic Regulation 477, Subsection 4, Clause B, Paragraph 13, an ancient decree forbidding any human from entering the restricted quadrant under penalty of immediate imprisonment. Cease all operations and surrender your assets to the Galactic Council.

Teslon blinked, his mind scrambling to process the message. Wait, what? Who,

You have violated the law, Mr. SpuskX, the alien continued, unperturbed. We will send a task force to apprehend you. Your company will be dissolved, your assets liquidated, and,

A pause.

Wait, you’re saying because I sent a rocket into some restricted area? A place that’s been abandoned for millennia?

Correct.

Well, that’s absurd. What even makes it restricted? Teslon leaned forward in his chair, intrigued. What’s out there? Some sort of space-time paradox or... a giant, space-faring monster?

The alien didn’t respond immediately. The silence grew thick. That... information is classified, it finally said.

Teslon grinned. He loved classified information.

Okay, he said, leaning back in his chair, so you’re telling me that this law was passed thousands of years ago, and nobody’s bothered to enforce it since. But now, I send a rocket into some forgotten part of space, and suddenly, I’m the bad guy? And you want me to just surrender, what, everything? My entire company? My assets? You realize how big SpuskX is now, right?

The alien didn’t seem impressed. Yes. And you’ll surrender everything unless you want to be arrested immediately.

Teslon paused, thinking for a moment. He’d read somewhere that the Galactic Empire was a huge bureaucracy, bogged down by endless red tape. If there was one thing Teslon knew, it was how to take advantage of bureaucratic systems.

I’ll tell you what, he said, the idea clicking into place. I’ll cooperate. But I want to talk to your legal team first. I think we can work out an... arrangement.

The alien narrowed its eyes. There will be no arrangement. You will comply, or you will face the full force of the law.

Teslon sat up straight, a wide grin spreading across his face. Oh, no. I’m going to need more than just a task force. If I’m going down, you’re going down with me.

A week later, the galaxy was abuzz with unexpected news. Teslon SpuskX had filed an appeal, one that the Galactic Empire had never seen before. It wasn’t a request for leniency or a plea for mercy. It was a technicality. A loophole so ridiculous that it made everyone stop and reconsider just how deep the bureaucratic hole could go.

Teslon had ascended to Minor Ruler Status.

The law stated that anyone who violated Galactic Regulation 477 had to be given a title of nobility before they could be formally tried. And in one stroke, Teslon had maneuvered around the system, naming himself the ruler of the planet Mars. It was an absurdity, but it was enough.

Of course, the Galactic Empire didn’t take kindly to this. The legal teams scrambled, unable to find a way to resolve the issue. But Teslon wasn’t finished yet.

In the coming weeks, he would launch a series of bureaucratic assaults on the Empire, filing endless appeals and petitions, using outdated legal language to throw them off track. The result? A near-constant stream of paperwork that flooded the Galactic Council’s inboxes.

At the same time, Teslon launched what he called the Mars Independence Movement, an online campaign with the goal of making Mars a sovereign empire. A meme-based political movement spread like wildfire, and soon, Teslon found himself surrounded by passionate followers from oppressed planets who saw him as a symbol of freedom.

While the Department of Galactic Empires scrambled to figure out how to stop him, Teslon made more moves. He declared war, then peace, and even held a galactic IPO, all in a single week. His followers cheered, their voices swelling in the digital space.

The Galactic Council, now on the verge of losing control, issued a decree: Teslon SpuskX must appear before them for trial.

But Teslon wasn’t worried. Not even a little.

He had something that no one had seen coming: a legal team made entirely of AI lawyers, an entire army of algorithms designed to bend the law to his will. He even built a robot judge himself, to oversee the trial. The idea was simple: overwhelm the system with an avalanche of legal filings.

And so, the trial began. The Galactic Council sat in their grand chamber, preparing for the battle ahead. The courtroom was silent as Teslon SpuskX walked in, his robot judge trailing behind him. His AI lawyers stood in a line, ready to fire off counterclaims at a moment's notice.

The trial didn’t last long. The system began to slow down as the counterclaims piled up, one after another. In the end, the Galactic Council’s server infrastructure couldn’t handle the weight of 1.4 trillion counterclaims.

The verdict came down.

Teslon SpuskX legally owned 17% of the galaxy.

He celebrated by selling it as NFTs.

And all of it started with a rocket, an outdated law, and the most absurd bureaucratic loophole the galaxy had ever seen.

As he sold his share of the galaxy, Teslon leaned back in his chair, smiling.

All I wanted was good Wi-Fi.

Give me a form! I need a form to process the form!

It had been months since Teslon SpuskX had secured his spot as a Minor Ruler of Mars, but his thirst for chaos, no, innovation, had only just begun. The paperwork war was now in full swing, and the galaxy’s top bureaucrats were beginning to understand the true meaning of his legal assault.

The Galactic Empire’s most experienced agents were being pulled into the mess one by one. It started with the Department of Galactic Empires (DGE), but soon enough, every corner of the Empire felt the tremors of SpuskX’s paperwork crusade. The more they fought, the deeper the hole Teslon had dug grew.

Teslon’s latest stunt? A galactic survey campaign. But not just any survey. A survey designed to grant self-determination to every single planet in the galaxy, at least, those that felt oppressed by the Empire.

You’re going to declare every single planet its own sovereign nation? his communications officer, Kex, asked, raising an eyebrow.

Why not? Everyone loves a revolution, don’t they? Teslon replied, chuckling. Besides, every planet’s got a legal system, Kex. We just need the right paperwork to make it official.

And just like that, every planet in the galaxy that had been quietly overlooked or kept under Empire control was suddenly submitting forms, each one declaring their independence from the Galactic Empire. Mars was now the beacon of hope for oppressed worlds, and the tidal wave of signatures only grew with each passing day.

The DGE had their hands full. Galactic officials were scrambling, trying to process the paperwork, trying to figure out how one man had turned a farce into a global phenomenon. Teslon had found his niche, he exploited every loophole he could find, filing endless petitions, challenging outdated clauses, and demanding that the Empire accept a new system of governance.

The problem? The Galactic Empire had one major flaw: it was slow. Slower than the slowest-moving star in the system, slower than the bureaucrats who spent their time filling out forms they would never read. Teslon, on the other hand, wasn’t just fast, he was fast and clever. Every form he filled out had a purpose. Each application, a calculated move. He became a symbol of revolt in the eyes of the oppressed, a figurehead of chaos that the Empire couldn’t seem to defeat.

As Teslon’s meme-driven Mars Independence Movement continued to grow, so did his fanbase. Everywhere, people rallied around the cause of freedom, freedom through paperwork. It became a cultural phenomenon. Teslon’s name spread far and wide, reaching planets that had no idea they even had a legal system to begin with.

The DGE wasn’t blind to this. In fact, they were watching with growing concern. The Galactic Council had already issued a decree, Teslon must be brought to trial. A trial so grand, so important, that it would settle the issue once and for all: was the Galactic Empire truly as powerful as it claimed to be? Or had one man, armed only with paperwork and a dubious legal mind, managed to outwit them all?

The trial was set to take place on a neutral planet, a location neither under Empire control nor SpuskX’s. The Galactic Council’s top judges, lawyers, and legal experts assembled in the vast courtroom. They had prepared for this moment, gathering evidence, creating strategies, and plotting counterattacks to nullify SpuskX’s claims.

They underestimated one thing: Teslon SpuskX was always a step ahead.

The trial began with a grand procession. The Galactic Council members filed into the chamber, sitting in their towering thrones. Above them, holographic images of planets, star systems, and entire regions of the galaxy floated, each symbolizing their domain. The vastness of the Empire was on display.

Teslon entered the room alone, but not without fanfare. His AI lawyers, programmed with centuries of legal knowledge, stood at attention behind him. He was dressed in a sharp suit that screamed business, but there was something about the way he walked that suggested this was all just another day at the office.

I assume you’ve prepared the necessary documentation for today’s hearing? one of the judges, a broad-skinned alien named Ilg’zar, asked from the bench.

Oh, absolutely, Teslon said with a grin. I’ve got everything we’ll need to make this an interesting day.

Ilg’zar raised an eyebrow. We’ll see about that.

The proceedings began, and the courtroom was filled with the sound of scrolling documents, clicking datapads, and the murmurs of legal experts scanning through piles of paperwork. Teslon, with his ever-present grin, didn’t seem to care much about the formality of it all. His legal team, however, was all business. They filed claim after counterclaim, each more ridiculous than the last.

By mid-afternoon, the Galactic Council was starting to look strained. They had just finished reviewing an unprecedented number of counterclaims when Teslon’s AI lawyer, the one named Zethar, presented a new motion: the Galactic Tax Exemption for Small Empires and Sovereign States Act.

What is this? one of the judges, a massive being with four arms, demanded, clearly frustrated. You can’t possibly be suggesting,

Oh, but I am, Teslon interrupted with a smile. You see, under this act, Mars qualifies for complete tax exemption. All due taxes to the Galactic Empire will be void. As a Minor Ruler, I am entitled to these exemptions.

The court erupted into chaos. The legal experts scrambled to interpret the law, while Teslon calmly sipped from a cup of tea. He had known about this clause for years, but it was only now, in the heat of this trial, that he was using it to its full advantage.

Zethar didn’t let up. Also, the AI lawyer continued, as per Galactic Law 1300, Subsection 22, Paragraph 7, Teslon SpuskX is entitled to declare war on any galactic body. Considering the hostile nature of the Galactic Empire’s tactics, Mars has every right to declare itself free of Empire control.

One of the Galactic judges, a small creature who resembled a walking jellyfish, floated nervously in his seat. This is... an abuse of the legal system!

Not at all, Teslon replied. It’s simply a creative interpretation of the law. And if you want to challenge it, you’ll need to do so in writing. In triplicate. No exceptions.

It was working. The Galactic Empire’s legal system was crumbling under the weight of SpuskX’s paperwork. The Galactic Council had no choice but to give him more time to present his claims, and every time they tried to shut him down, Teslon would find another law, another clause to exploit.

Days passed. The trial turned into an exhausting battle of paperwork, claims, and counterclaims. Teslon was relentless, his team filed endless appeals, creating an ever-growing pile of paperwork that no one could keep up with.

Then came the unexpected twist. Teslon didn’t just file for tax exemptions or rights to self-determination. No, he had something far more ambitious in mind. He declared himself the rightful owner of several core systems in the galaxy. And through a technicality in the galactic deed system, he had acquired legal titles to those systems.

The Empire was on the brink of collapse.

The Galactic Council convened one last time, their voices echoing in the courtroom.

SpuskX, one of the judges began, his voice shaking, you are forcing us into a corner. There is no way out. Your claims,

Teslon’s smile widened. I believe we’re done here.

And just like that, the system crashed. It was impossible to handle the weight of a trillion counterclaims, millions of petitions, and the complex web of legal maneuvers Teslon had set into motion.

The verdict came down hours later. Teslon SpuskX, through paperwork alone, had acquired 17% of the galaxy. And he was about to sell it off as NFTs.

The galaxy watched with baited breath. Teslon SpuskX, the man who had taken the Galactic Empire to its knees using nothing more than legal loopholes, had finally emerged victorious. His ownership of 17% of the galaxy was a fact now, a certified truth recorded in the annals of galactic history. His victory was an absurdity. It was also a reminder of how vulnerable a system could be when it was mired in its own bureaucracy.

Now came the final move.

The Galactic Empire, humbled by paperwork, tried to close ranks, attempting to regain some form of control over their fractured systems. But they couldn’t. They could not bring themselves to fight what had already been legally decided. What did the Empire do when their most powerful weapon, control, was taken away by forms, signatures, and submissions?

Teslon knew they would try something. They always tried to do something. The might of the Empire would never accept the situation. But Teslon had anticipated that. In fact, he had been counting on it.

He sat comfortably in his private office aboard the *SpuskX Mariner*, a ship designed to handle intergalactic business, paperwork, and stunts. The sleek, futuristic design was punctuated by stacks of forms and datapads strewn about, a chaotic reflection of his legal empire. A small, satisfied smirk tugged at his lips as he watched the digital news feeds. The galaxy was in upheaval.

He could feel the tension building. He could hear the low rumblings of unease coming from every corner of the Empire. The news had spread like wildfire, Teslon had secured legal control of vast sections of the galaxy, and now he was about to monetize it.

Declare war, peace, or an IPO... All in one week? Kex said as he walked into the room, carrying a coffee cup that looked oddly out of place in the high-tech environment. You sure that’s the way to do this?

Teslon chuckled, eyes still locked on the holoscreen. You’ve got to keep them guessing, Kex. You know how it is. You make one move, and they start to think they can predict you. But no one can predict a galactic IPO.

And what if they do start predicting you? Kex asked, raising an eyebrow.

Teslon’s eyes flicked over to his friend, the corner of his mouth twitching upward. Then I’ll just submit an appeal. I’ll challenge the concept of prediction itself. I’m sure there’s a law against it somewhere.

Kex shook his head with a smirk, taking a seat across from him. You’re unbelievable.

Maybe, Teslon said with a shrug. But here’s the thing, Kex. I didn’t start this to change the galaxy. I started this because... well, it was fun. The most entertaining thing about all this bureaucracy is watching them squirm. I didn’t want to be Emperor of the Galaxy. That wasn’t my goal. All I wanted was good Wi-Fi.

Kex snorted. Good Wi-Fi?

Teslon nodded, grinning. That’s right. For too long, the Empire has hoarded the best tech, the best bandwidth, the most reliable systems. You can’t even stream a good movie without your connection dropping in half the galaxy. But now... well, now I control 17% of the galaxy. If you want a connection to Mars, you’re going to need to pay my rates. And those rates are going to be higher than anything the Empire can manage. No more lag, no more buffering.

It was ridiculous. It was absurd. But it was genius.

Teslon leaned back in his chair, his fingers steepling as he surveyed the situation. He had done the impossible. And now, he was going to sell it to the highest bidder.

The announcement came a day later. Teslon SpuskX, now legally recognized as the ruler of 17% of the galaxy, had decided to sell it off, piece by piece, through non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The press release was brief but effective:

*In light of my legal victories, I am now offering exclusive ownership of the following star systems, planets, and resources in perpetuity. By acquiring one of these NFTs, you will legally own a piece of the galaxy. Please read the terms and conditions carefully, as some planets have very specific laws regarding ownership, but trust me, it’s all in the fine print.*

Within hours, Teslon’s NFTs were all the rage. Investors, opportunists, and even the casual wealthy began snapping them up. The virtual marketplace was alive with transactions, each one more ludicrous than the last. People were buying and selling entire solar systems like they were rare trading cards. Teslon had created a new form of commerce, one that thrived on absurdity, speed, and legal chaos.

The Galactic Empire watched in horror as more and more systems were bought up. A small but significant part of the galaxy was now, legally, under the control of private citizens. Wealthy corporations began to establish their own sovereign planets, complete with security forces, currencies, and, most importantly, unrestricted access to the newly constructed SpuskX Wi-Fi network.

The Galactic Council, desperate to regain control, attempted to issue a decree. They argued that Teslon’s NFTs were illegal under Galactic Law 3300, Section 12, Clause 7. The ruling was immediate and expected.

Teslon’s response? I’ve already filed an appeal, and I’ve attached a petition for an extension on your ruling. It’s not my fault that your legal system is so outdated. Maybe you should consider updating it, but I can help with that too. Just send me a form, and I’ll have a lawyer fill it out for you.

The Galactic Empire had no choice but to sit back, helpless, as the digital landscape shifted around them. Teslon SpuskX had not only outsmarted them, he had transformed the entire structure of the galaxy. He was a king, not by force or violence, but by cleverness, legal tactics, and a willingness to bend, break, and redefine the rules.

The closing line of his press release summed it all up perfectly: *All I wanted was good Wi-Fi.*

Months passed. The dust of the trial had settled, but its effects were still being felt. Teslon SpuskX had successfully dismantled the hold of the Galactic Empire over vast portions of the galaxy. With his own network of planets, resources, and even political allegiances, he had created a new form of governance, one that thrived not on might, but on paper.

The Empire? It had learned a hard lesson. It had learned that no system, no matter how vast or powerful, was immune to the corrosive influence of paperwork. The galaxy would never be the same. But as for Teslon, he remained on top, sitting comfortably in his chair, sipping his tea. Life was good.

For Teslon SpuskX, the victory was sweet, but it was only the beginning.

*Next,* he said with a grin, *we take over the galactic coffee supply chain.*

One day I was getting the kids ready for school, and the toddler did not want to sit in the stroller. She was throwing a tantrum, and I was trying to pick her up and help her get in the stroller. My husband's dad came outside and started yelling ""this is abuse"" and ""you are abusing her"". My husband acknowledges that I was not literally abusing her.

My husband came home and gave his parents the ultimatum that they could either agree to stop yelling at me or they could move out, and they chose to move out. After he went back to work, his dad was yelling at his mom that nobody would stop him from yelling at me. 

The next morning, I asked my husband to please change our daughter for school. Usually I did it (while my husband was at work), but his father and mother would often interfere, and one or both might start yelling at me or at each other if our daughter threw a tantrum. His mother was in the room and said I had no right to be scared to be yelled at by his father because I was calling him ""crazy"" if I was worried about him yelling at me and that he only yelled at me when I did something wrong. She said I must have abused my daughter or else he would not have yelled at me.

I shared the following things with my husband in a calm, emotionally vulnerable way:

1. When possible, I do not want to be around your parents, but if I have to be, I would prefer to have a third person there because they yell at me less when someone else is there. I even offered to go work from a coffee shop during the day after I handled the childcare duties so that they could have the house to themselves.

2. I want a firm date by which we will no longer live together - even if it is 90 days from now and we are the ones moving out. I just need to know when our cohabitation will be over. (For context, we agreed that them living with us was on a trial basis, and if anyone wanted to stop the arrangement, anyone could at any time, presumably with some notice. The previous month I told him I no longer wanted his parents to live with us, and he grew angry and said, ""I am done being your partner."")

Hey folks!

I made a post earlier around similar topic, unfortunately the post was misunderstood and I felt that I could convey certain things differently. So here is me, trying again. This might be a long read! (**4 mins**)

**Why am I making this post?**

My ideal approach to dating is this:  
Do activities which I like => meet more ppl => make friends => if I'm attracted, I reach out to them

I like this the most, but this is also the most time consuming. 

I want to find ppl who I would like more quickly. I tired dating apps, I hate them and don't use them (unless I feel really down). I don't like the idea of swiping just based on few photos. I also didn't get a lot of matches, which made it even more frustrating. I personally get attracted to the personality more (demi-sexual, need time for the attraction to build). I also don't like social events (like singles night/spaeti night), where it is too competitive. I hate competing for attention. What I liked was few offline dating events (like once strangers - where there is intention but low pressure). If there are more events like this - pls lmk! 

These are the things I decided to focus more on: 

* Explore new activities (make the top funnel big)
* Go to more offline dating events
* Create more awareness across the community or friends of friends (like generating more leads!) 

This is where the post comes in! Through this post, I'm hoping to reach out to more like minded people, share details about me and what I'm looking for. And hopefully if my post resonates with them, they reach out to me \^\^

You may ask how is ""this"" different from normal dating apps. My belief is through this post, I would share more information than what you get from dating apps, and more clearly I'm showing strong intention (which might not always be there in dating apps).

1ks8cba,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1ks8cba/i_miss_him_so_much_and_am_questioning_if_it_was/,I miss him so much and am questioning if it was abuse or if things can get better,"My ex has a lot of behavioral and mental health problems (including ADHD, PTSD) that make it difficult for him to regulate emotions and control his impulses and anger. As a result, he has exploded at me many times and has done/said a lot of very hurtful things which I have been told are emotionally and verbally abusive. I ended my relationship with him despite deeply loving him very much (when he’s “good”, things are amazing and he’s extremely fun and loving and kind, but when he’s bad…things can feel terrible). He has never hit me or physically harmed me which is why I am wondering if I am just overreacting. 

However, I often question it and think maybe I’m overreacting, perhaps he just has mental problems and is kind of an asshole sometimes but it’s not actually abusive. During one of his anger episodes he blew up at me for leaking 2 drops of period blood in the sheets by accident (I leaked through my shorts, underwear, tampon, and pad). He called me a dirty unhygienic animal, was yelling at me for not cleaning it up immediately (I didn’t clean it up right away because the light in our bedroom was still off when I woke up and I didn’t want to wake him up when I went to go make us both breakfast. He’s gotten mad at me for turning the light on, hence why I kept it off and didn’t see anything). As soon as he told me I went to wash the sheets but he was still livid, saying that none of his past ex’s ever had this problem and that if I can’t figure out basic human hygiene then I should sleep in the living room. He suggested I wear diapers and compared me to an animal. When I called him out for being disrespectful, he raised his voice even more, took all my clothes and threw them near the front door and threatened to dump me and kick me out.

I was really hurt by this and later he apologized for losing his cool flying into a rage. He knows he has mental/behavioral problems and has had these issues since childhood, and it’s gotten him in trouble with his friends, romantic relationships, family, classmates, and colleagues. He’s burned many bridges in his life due to this issue and I know that he hates being this way so I feel kind of sorry for him. However, he’s also done a lot of other things which have been anxiety-provoking and hurtful to me, like screaming in arguments, calling me terrible names (every cuss word imaginable), kicking things, breaking stuff, throwing things around me, slamming his fists down or punching the wall, etc. He’s yelled at me, called me names, and threatened to dump me over things as ridiculous as leaving a few drops of water on the bathroom floor after a shower, leaving a single dish in the sink, forgetting to bring a receipt to the store, eating too much cheese, not wanting to eat the fat on my steak, being 20 minutes late for coffee because of a headache, etc. All of this made me feel like I was tiptoeing on eggshells around his explosive anger and I became extremely jumpy and hyper-vigilant. He was also making a lot of jokes about hitting, strangling, and killing me which, while not serious, made me feel uncomfortable.

Once when we were long distance, he was living in his home country which was at war (something he’s used to because he grew up that way) with his parents and wanted me to come visit. I wanted him to come visit me instead, but he refused to leave his parents. My flight was scheduled at the same day/time as a ballistic missile strike and my county (the USA) issued a strong warning against tourists visiting the region. I told him I was scared and that probably my plane flight would be cancelled if I tried to come (it indeed was cancelled) but he kept insisting that I get over my fear and come. I almost came but my family talked me out of it, and as a result he called me a coward, said I didn’t love him enough, and threatened to dump me. His behaviors were so physically and mentally draining that I eventually had a nervous breakdown for a few weeks and almost dropped out of my graduate program. 

He has always apologized after everything and has never physically harmed me. A few months later, I still deeply miss him and love him despite all of it. He’s trying to convince me to give him another chance and says he will take his mental issues more seriously. Now he’s saying he will meditate, “try harder” to not scream at me, work on himself more, find a better therapist (he’s tried therapy several times for a few weeks each time in the past but always eventually gave up after a few weeks because he said it was too expensive and not helpful), try to be a “better person”, etc. I want so badly to believe that he can change but I don’t feel convinced. But also maybe it wasn’t abuse and perhaps I’m being unfair and making too big a deal out of it his mental issues. When he wasn’t having behavioral issues, we got along perfectly well, were best friends, and had so much fun together. I miss that so much and am considering giving him one more chance. At this point, I don’t know whether I was overreacting to think he was abusive.",2,1747859592.0,emotionalabuse,4,1.0,False

Constellation’s latest long-range gamble, assembled with Stroud-Eklund polish, colony ship salvage, and exactly the sort of bureaucratic sleight-of-hand that makes starship auditors develop facial tics.

Word is, Constellation negotiated hard. The UC nearly shelved the whole thing after the New Atlantis incident. Official line claims it was a gesture of inter-factional goodwill. Unofficially, the Freestar Collective got a seat at the table, Sam Coe smirked through negotiations, and Sarah Morgan brought a slide deck labeled *“You owe us.”*

Designers called it collaborative. Engineers called it “stacking incompatible legacies and praying the bolts hold.” Stroud-Eklund sent over their premium suite line. Nova Galactic junkyards coughed up the bones of a colony ship. Deimos and Taiyo parts sealed the armor. What emerged was a vessel stitched from diplomacy, legacy, and pressure.

They named it Discovery. Not the first to wear the name—but maybe the first to earn it by committee.

Sensor logs recorded a short tour. Jemison to Mars, then a handshake on Akila. Neon lit the launch—of course it did. Cameras caught the burn to deep space like it was a sendoff parade. No grav guns. No cloak field. Just a ship pointing itself into whatever still waits out there.

1ks8aqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1ks8aqm/i_miss_him_and_now_am_questioning_if_it_was_abuse/,I miss him and now am questioning if it was abuse,"My ex has a lot of behavioral and mental health problems (including ADHD, PTSD) that make it difficult for him to regulate emotions and control his impulses and anger. As a result, he has exploded at me many times and has done/said a lot of very hurtful things which I have been told are emotionally and verbally abusive. I ended my relationship with him despite deeply loving him very much (when he’s “good”, things are amazing and he’s extremely fun and loving and kind, but when he’s bad…things can feel terrible). He has never hit me or physically harmed me which is why I am wondering if I am just overreacting. 

However, I often question it and think maybe I’m overreacting, perhaps he just has mental problems and is kind of an asshole sometimes but it’s not actually abusive. During one of his anger episodes he blew up at me for leaking 2 drops of period blood in the sheets by accident (I leaked through my shorts, underwear, tampon, and pad). He called me a dirty unhygienic animal, was yelling at me for not cleaning it up immediately (I didn’t clean it up right away because the light in our bedroom was still off when I woke up and I didn’t want to wake him up when I went to go make us both breakfast. He’s gotten mad at me for turning the light on, hence why I kept it off and didn’t see anything). As soon as he told me I went to wash the sheets but he was still livid, saying that none of his past ex’s ever had this problem and that if I can’t figure out basic human hygiene then I should sleep in the living room. He suggested I wear diapers and compared me to an animal. When I called him out for being disrespectful, he raised his voice even more, took all my clothes and threw them near the front door and threatened to dump me and kick me out.

I was really hurt by this and later he apologized for losing his cool flying into a rage. He knows he has mental/behavioral problems and has had these issues since childhood, and it’s gotten him in trouble with his friends, romantic relationships, family, classmates, and colleagues. He’s burned many bridges in his life due to this issue and I know that he hates being this way so I feel kind of sorry for him. However, he’s also done a lot of other things which have been anxiety-provoking and hurtful to me, like screaming in arguments, calling me terrible names (every cuss word imaginable), kicking things, breaking stuff, throwing things around me, slamming his fists down or punching the wall, etc. He’s yelled at me, called me names, and threatened to dump me over things as ridiculous as leaving a few drops of water on the bathroom floor after a shower, leaving a single dish in the sink, forgetting to bring a receipt to the store, eating too much cheese, not wanting to eat the fat on my steak, being 20 minutes late for coffee because of a headache, etc. All of this made me feel like I was tiptoeing on eggshells around his explosive anger and I became extremely jumpy and hyper-vigilant. He was also making a lot of jokes about hitting, strangling, and killing me which, while not serious, made me feel uncomfortable.

Once when we were long distance, he was living in his home country which was at war (something he’s used to because he grew up that way) with his parents and wanted me to come visit. I wanted him to come visit me instead, but he refused to leave his parents. My flight was scheduled at the same day/time as a ballistic missile strike and my county (the USA) issued a strong warning against tourists visiting the region. I told him I was scared and that probably my plane flight would be cancelled if I tried to come (it indeed was cancelled) but he kept insisting that I get over my fear and come. I almost came but my family talked me out of it, and as a result he called me a coward, said I didn’t love him enough, and threatened to dump me. His behaviors were so physically and mentally draining that I eventually had a nervous breakdown for a few weeks and almost dropped out of my graduate program. 

He has always apologized after everything and has never physically harmed me. A few months later, I still deeply miss him and love him despite all of it. He’s trying to convince me to give him another chance and says he will take his mental issues more seriously. Now he’s saying he will meditate, “try harder” to not scream at me, work on himself more, find a better therapist (he’s tried therapy several times for a few weeks each time in the past but always eventually gave up after a few weeks because he said it was too expensive and not helpful), try to be a “better person”, etc. I want so badly to believe that he can change but I don’t feel convinced. But also maybe it wasn’t abuse and perhaps I’m being unfair and making too big a deal out of it his mental issues. When he wasn’t having behavioral issues, we got along perfectly well, were best friends, and had so much fun together. I miss that so much and am considering giving him one more chance.

1ks87f1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyVloggersandmore/comments/1ks87f1/chris_browns_5m_getoutofjail_card_tour_on_justice/,"Chris Brown’s £5M Get-Out-of-Jail Card: Tour On, Justice Off","Well, well, well, here we go again with the Chris Brown circus, and this time, the ringmaster’s got a shiny new update that’ll make your eyes roll harder than a bowling ball down a hill. In a move that screams “justice system, what’s that?”, a London judge at Southwark Crown Court decided on May 21, 2025, to let this bottle-swinging disaster of a human, Chris Brown, stroll out of custody on a cool £5 million ($6.7 million) bail. Yeah, you heard that right—£5 million to keep his world tour, the so-called “Breezy Bowl XX,” on track to kick off in Amsterdam on June 8. Because apparently, nothing says “let’s give this guy a break” like a repeat violent offender with a private jet and a rap sheet longer than a CVS receipt.

So, let’s recap this nonsense. Brown, the 36-year-old “singer” who’s better known for his fists than his falsetto, was nabbed at Manchester’s Lowry Hotel on May 15, 2025, for allegedly turning music producer Abe Diaw into a human punching bag at London’s Tape nightclub back in February 2023. 

The charge? Grievous bodily harm with intent, after Brown reportedly smashed a Don Julio 1942 tequila bottle over Diaw’s head, chased him down, and treated him like a personal sparring dummy with punches and kicks. Diaw ended up with head lacerations, torn ligaments, and a $16 million lawsuit that’s still simmering, with a trial set for June 2026. The whole thing was caught on CCTV in a packed club, with prosecutor Hannah Nicholls calling it an “unprovoked attack with a weapon.” But sure, let’s give this guy bail because… tour dates?
The judge’s logic must’ve been, “Well, he’s got a concert in Manchester on June 15, so let’s not inconvenience the fans!” Never mind that Brown’s been dodging accountability since his 2009 assault on Rihanna, with arrests piling up like his Spotify streams—Florida in 2018, Texas lawsuits, you name it. Posts on X are buzzing with fans cheering that their precious “Breezy” can still perform, while others are rightfully gagging at the idea of a guy with his track record walking free just because he’s got deep pockets. Oh, and that £5 million bail? He’ll likely get it back if he shows up to his next hearing on June 20, 2025, where he’ll finally have to enter a plea. So, basically, it’s a pricey hall pass to keep strutting around like he didn’t just allegedly hospitalize someone.

And here’s the cherry on this garbage sundae: I’ve got an interview lined up with Abe Diaw himself, the guy who’s still picking glass out of his ego thanks to Brown’s tequila tantrum. Can’t wait to hear his side—bet it’s a doozy. Meanwhile, Brown’s out there, probably practicing his dance moves instead of, you know, reflecting on why he keeps ending up in handcuffs. This whole thing is a joke, and not the funny kind. The UK courts just handed a serial screw-up a get-out-of-jail card, and we’re all supposed to act like it’s fine because he’s got a mic and a fanbase. Karma’s clearly on a coffee break, but here’s hoping Diaw’s lawsuit and that June 20 hearing remind Brown that actions have consequences—even for pigs with platinum records. Stay tuned for the interview, because this clown show’s far from over. 🤡

Over the past two years, I’ve had three psychotic episodes—two were full-blown (the first one required hospitalization). I was misdiagnosed at first and wasn’t on any medication, which led to a second episode about a year ago after which I was finally diagnosed for bipolar. The third episode, around six months ago, was mild mania triggered by raw coffee and Red Bull—at that time, I was taking meds.

After that third episode, something changed. I had this clear realization about what my trigger was, and since then, I genuinely feel like I’ve moved on from it.

I was prescribed Dicorate-ER 500 mg (Valproate) and Carinia 1.5 mg (Cariprazine), but I’ve been off both meds for about a month now. Despite not having any manic symptoms lately, my mood has been unstable the past few days. I feel emotionally off, easily irritated, and just low without any obvious reason. Sleep is okay-ish, and I’m eating alright, but the mood swings are bothering me.

Also, I’ve been experiencing significant hair fall since I started the meds and it hasn’t stopped till now.

I don’t feel triggered or manic, but the mood issues are creeping in again. Should I be concerned? Any thoughts or advice would really help.

Thanks in advance.

They almost killed me while driving and texting and staring at their phone instead of the road. One more day and I was ready to eat my arm off.

I met my best friend when we were 15 and 16. We all work in the same profession, but I won't be sharing what that profession is; all names are fake.

I met my boyfriend, we'll call him Jake, at a party in his college town when I was 18 and he was 20. We didn't exchange information or anything, we just talked all night and then I left with my friends. It's safe to say I thought he made an impact because I called my best friend, who we'll call Julie, as soon as I got back to my hotel and talked about him for an obscene amount of time for a guy I just met. I put the ""hot guy from the party"" out of my mind because I literally thought I was never going to see him again and I had a huge event for work at the end of the week so I had to prepare. Julie ended up being allowed to fly out for the event so after, she came to congratulate me and said she had a surprise for me. I looked at her confused but as she moved aside Jake came into the doorway. Apparently, they watched the event sitting next to each other (Jake was looking to get into the same profession so he came to the event in hopes to mingle) and they talked the whole time. I was 18 and stupid so I still didn't get his number because I thought it would have been awkward, but we followed each other on social media and were pleasant online. Around 6 months later I got another job opportunity that I was super excited about. I walk into the room and it turns out Jake was able to be a part of the same opportunity. At this point I accepted fate and we exchanged numbers. That meeting broke for lunch and Julie walked into the room with 3 drinks in her hand. I was a bit confused, but happy that she was there. She smiled at me and handed me my drink and then walked past me and gave a drink to Jake as well. I thought it was nice of her to bring him a coffee (I'd texted her a ""you wouldn't believe who is here right now"") but after she'd handed it to him she pulled him in for a hug. Apparently, THEY had exchanged numbers at the presentation and had been talking every day for 6 months. Julie assured me nothing was going on between them, just that they found out they had common interests and so they were talking. Apparently, Julie had been giving him advice on getting into this industry too and helped him get the job we were currently working on. Since Jake and I weren't together at the time I felt silly for being weary about it, but I had been talking to Julie about him nonstop since the party and I don't know why she didn't tell me about them talking. She doesn't like owe me an explanation for everyone she speaks to, but it just seems like something she and I would talk about. Like ""Oh my god you didn't get his number? Well, guess what I did and also he's gonna be working on that project with you!!!""

It's still a lot like that to this day. They go out a lot for coffee, they have shows they only watch together, and they have nicknames for each other that kind of sound like pet names (my bf frequents this sub so I won't be sharing). I will admit, I think I am a little jealous, but I really can't tell who I am jealous of more. They both spend a lot of time with each other and I stay at home with our toddler (2m) or I am working and they take the kids on a playdate (Julie's toddler is 3m). I work a lot with Jake, but Julie has also been trying to work on a lot of the same projects as we are. I brought this up to Julie, not trying to be accusatory or anything, and she said she and Jake are like me and Byron (our other work friend, also 27m) who I have known since I was a kid. He is more of an older brother to me, which is understandable for Jake and Julie, but we don't hang out nearly as much as they do. Julie is also our neighbor. I moved in with Jake before we found out I was pregnant, but before that, he'd bought a place right next to Julie. I am 100% sure there is no cheating going on, so that's not a worry of mine. I just want to be able to spend a good amount of time with both of them and right now I am feeling kind of isolated and like I have to compete for the attention of people I shouldn't have to compete for. It's completely innocent and I truly think it's just an issue of boundaries. Julie and I met when we were really young and we have kind of just shared everything since then so I think she just wants to be included with Jake, and she and Jake are pretty much the same person so I think we all just need to have a discussion, but how do I approach this without sounding like I'm crazy?

I'd also like to add: I have great relationships with both of them. Jake and I have never really gotten into any serious arguments and he loves me and our son more than anything. He and Julie are just friends, and I later found out that a lot of the talk on the phone during the first 6 months after they met was about how Jake had a massive crush on me but was afraid to say anything. I mainly just included that to show how long we've all known each other and to explain the dynamics a bit. The only weird thing about it is that Julie and I have a sort of sibling-like competitive relationship, especially because we don't really have an aspect of our lives that we don't share, so she often says that she knew him first so she has to side with him, etc. But we haven't ever fought over anything more than wearing each other's clothes without asking and even then it's all jokes. We are all really good friends, I trust Jake and he respects me way too much to do anything outside of our relationship, which is otherwise very strong. Besides, Julie has been in a long-term relationship for about 3 years now. Just wanting some advice on how to set boundaries.
