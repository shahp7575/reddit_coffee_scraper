It started when we were in the same class and she used to laugh at all my jokes. We kinda hit it off and I noticed we just really clicked. It was a different sort of connection you don‚Äôt feel with many people. Despite her texting me first she tended to take lots and lots of time to respond, and then not at all. Regardless, about a month later even though we were not very close outside of this one class I decided to send her a text asking if she was back in the country with plans to ask her out(as she had gone overseas). She said was overseas still so I kinda said never mind then and changed the subject. Somehow this turned into hours of texting and within the next day we were FaceTiming for hours late at night. The big shock however, she was not coming back to the country until 2 months later. We talked every single day and with bits of flirting (her calling me cute vice versa), and lots of deep talks too. Among these she asked why I texted her asking if I was in the country and I told her straight up I was gonna ask her out and she said she would have said yes.
One night though we were talking as usual and got into the topic of our futures. I ask her where she wants to live in the future and she says she will move out of the city as soon as uni ends. Still without true feelings in the air I questioned ‚Äúwhat if you have a boyfriend in uni?‚Äù With her replying she doesn‚Äôt want to date at all. My heart kind of skipped a beat and I sort of asked along the lines of well what am I to you then. Apparently I was just another ‚Äòclose friend‚Äô to her that she just happened to exclusively talk to for months (mind you this was about 2 weeks before she came back). In sort of just pure betrayal and sadness I told her a cold goodbye and went to sleep. 
The next morning I felt awful and being dumb and desperate to keep her in my life I wrote a whole paragraph about how I was sorry for putting her in that position and that I never even liked her past friends anyway which was a lie as I definitely did like her and made it pretty clear. She said it was fine to still be friends and that she‚Äôs often quite clueless to flirting which was also shocking but understandable as she‚Äôs very objectively very pretty and usually gets lots of attention from guys which she thinks is just kindness.
Now, it‚Äôs been about another month of friendship but as she came back to the country I left to go on holidays myself and there has been no time to catch up in person other than one day where she was ‚Äòtoo stressed‚Äô. I know I‚Äôm a bad person for staying friends with her despite my feelings and my lingering want to be with her, but i sort of had hoped that my feelings would disperse by now because it‚Äôs rare to have that sort of connection with someone else so easily and I wanted to keep in contact. Basically I just want to know if I should tell her I‚Äôm unable to get over her or if I should stay friends with her anyway or try to make her fall in love with me because for all I know she may have at one stage because it felt so real. It‚Äôs also difficult because it was all long distance for so long which just makes it feel so pathetic that I was so attached. Also I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs possible for her to still catch feelings for me once we meet in person as she‚Äôs been relatively keen to meet for coffee or some sort of hangout too.
Sorry for the rant I just have no one to talk to about this sort of stuff :/
P.S I know that the obvious answer is just ‚Äòmove on‚Äô but it‚Äôs very hard when someone you‚Äôve known for only 6 months feels like you‚Äôve known them your whole life and have gone from acquaintances to best friends in the space of a month.

I still love the girl who friendzoned me and broke my heart, do I confess to her again months later or just leave her alone or try to continue being friends.",1,1740838080.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

My recent coffee vanilla mead turned out real well with the local farm honey.  I have been using the Costco wild flower honey from Argentina and not of those batches have turned out bad but i am looking to try some higher quality honeys.   

Has anyone used this and what were your results?

I recently discovered yerba mate, and I absolutely love it! I‚Äôve always struggled with coffee because of digestion and blood pressure issues, and tea isn‚Äôt ideal for me due to iron absorption concerns. Mate has been a game-changer‚ÄîI feel great drinking it, and I buy from a local fair-trade shop, so I have no doubts about the quality.

The only problem? I work in an office and travel quite a bit, so carrying around my thermos, gourd, and bombilla isn‚Äôt always practical. I know it‚Äôs pretty much sacrilegious to brew mate in something like a Stanley cup (and honestly, I agree‚Äîit just doesn‚Äôt taste the same).

So, my probably dumb question: Are there different types of yerba mate? Like, is there a version that‚Äôs more ‚Äúconcentrated‚Äù and meant to be brewed in a larger container for longer periods without losing flavor or benefits? I‚Äôd love to drink mate every day, but I need a way to make it work with my lifestyle, especially since I live in a country where mate isn‚Äôt really part of the culture.

Any advice would be super appreciated! Thanks!",1,1740838016.0,yerbamate,0,1.0,False

It was a small neighbourhood cafe, heaps of regulars. I only told a handful of customers I‚Äôm particularly fond of that I was leaving and no one else.

My old boss and co workers have contacted me to ask if I could come back because apparantly people are losing their minds that I‚Äôm not there anymore. I mean - people are demanding to know where I work now, have asked for my contact information to reach out to me, have said they‚Äôre never coming back because I‚Äôm not there anymore. In the 3 weeks I‚Äôve been gone there are about 35 regulars who would come in every morning who have stopped completely (my ex co workers told me this, some of these customers have been coming in religiously every single morning including weekends for 4+ years).

As I‚Äôm working in the CBD now I‚Äôve actually run into a few of my old regulars, and I am 100% serious when I say four of them actually broke down and cried when they saw me. One even got a bit aggressive and blamed me for ruining his mornings now as he has to find another coffee shop to go to on his drive to work. 

This is‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs actually fucking wild to me how people have responded. My co workers are lovely and make coffee just as good as I did, as do the two people who replaced me (tired old hospo story, when you‚Äôre somewhere long enough you end up doing the work of 2-4 people and making it look easy).

I‚Äôm not even that bubbly and outgoing of a person, while I understand seeing a familiar face is comforting and of course after so many years I know a lot of details about people‚Äôs lives but‚Ä¶ seriously? My boss is begging me to come back because their sales have dropped significantly, but I never would as hospo wages and hours cannot compete with corporate and I‚Äôm enjoying earning a wage I can enjoy and save and not barely survive off.

Can anyone shed some light on this? Is it because we‚Äôre basically free therapists? You come in, buy a coffee, then spend 20 minutes dumping your trauma on the barista because they can‚Äôt leave the coffee machine and have to listen to you? Like I just honestly didn‚Äôt think anyone would give a shit about the person serving them/making their coffee as long as the service/product was good? 

I have never been and will never be a regular at a cafe (despite being a barista for close to 15 years I rarely drink coffee) so I‚Äôm just hoping someone can shed some light on this. One of my co workers I worked with for 4 years just quit a few days ago because she is fed up with people asking after me. It makes absolutely no sense to me at all.

The boats have a cafe on board and during the week in the spring you dont get many tourists so seats are plentiful inside and out.

My only caveat is dont get off at barking riverside... there is litterally nothing there apart from the train station... you will be sorely disappointed its nowhere near barking town centre...like I was. However if you are just going for a walk its got a nice riverside walk with a bit of wildlife to photograph.

Ive started using a moka pot fairly recently, like since past 3-4 weeks. Initially, my coffee used to brew perfectly, with a good flow, no sputtering till the end and it was tasty and flavorful.

However, since the past couple of days, I have started to get this really acidic flavor in my coffee that I brew using the same moka pot, and it also sputters very soon. I am using a 3 cup IMUSA moka pot and this is how I make my coffee:

1. Heat water a little less than boiling.
2. Grind coffee fine, but not espresso fine, put it in the ground chamber (basket?) and lightly tap.
3. Put water in the lower chamber a little lower than the valve.
4. Put an aeropress filter before the mesh, wet it a little to stick it.
5. Screw everything together tightly and put it on the gas (lowest flame)

I have been using this same method since Ive started using this pot, and it has worked perfectly before, however, for the past couple of days, this exact same method has been giving me problems. I am a bit confused as to why and I really don't like this acidic flavor in my coffee. I read somewhere that this means that the coffee is underbrewed.

Do you seasoned users have any tips or advice as to what Im doing wrong, and where can I improve. I make sure to keep my moka pot clean and dry after every use and there is no damage.

EDIT: Also wanted to add, since the problem started, I have noticed that the color of my concentrate has become darker and more towards the black side, instead of the slightly more dark brown color that I used to get, if that helps.",2,1740836872.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

Do you connect with each other in the dream space before doing it physically?

I keep dreaming lately of my person. This our 3rd year of knowing eachother in this lifetime...(But obviously time is non linear to the eternal soul lol) 

In the last couple years, when we've met in the dream space... It's been odd. Like we would hug and merge into one being - like literally, not figuratively. It was very trippy. Pretty self explanatory though. But they were always so sensorial and vivid like... I can still feel the fabric of his shirt and the colours. And the merging. At that time we were spending more time together in real life and getting closer. But we hadn't ever had proper physical contact- never hugged.

Then in the last couple weeks, we've been getting even closer and the universe has been showing synchronicities that others have confirmed... For example, he looks like Prince eric from the Little Mermaid and I can't unsee it and I tell him all the time, and a mutual friend was with us and I said it in front of her and she agreed and she said I look like Ariel and right at that moment...another person turned around and was wearing a Little Mermaid Jacket like right next to us. We all were like ....omg

Me and me person have hugged once back in December on Friday the 13th (its my dad's birthday). 

My dreams lately have been if us sharing a very sweet moment. Our first kiss. It's shy, awkward and very sweet. And it feels so real and we've NEVER connected this way in dreams (or in real life) but we are closer in real life. We hang out. He texts me. Calls me. Face times me. We've gone out to a few parties. He's taken me to restaurants. Gives me coffee. Etc.

Now when these moments happen in both my dreams or in real life it's like ... The ""climax"" of a cycle. Like the furthest point we've gone or a new level thats been achieved. And then we are reset in a cycle and we end up going through a cycle of things the feel like we've been through before but ... Slightly different. Like even similar conversations, and themes but is a much less impactful experience than before. I don't know how to explain it other than this. 

And it literally feels like we have to do this every time we connect in the dream space in a new level or real life. 

Before we hugged, I had been dreaming of us doing that for literally 2 years. When we hugged, immediately after that, that was the first time he disconnected from the connection since we met (3 years) and the longest we went without any contact whatsoever. 

It was horrible. But I did my best to let go. 
But i think he had a not so great time himself. Because when we're reconnected I told him how upset I was and he told me he was going through a lot at home. 

Now we've had these dreams of us kissing, he seems to be acting a way he did this time last year, but cycling through the stages at a faster rate... 

It's like... I've already gone through the cycle and I've been here for 13 years as I've been doing this since 2021. And he's been doing a speed run since 2022, when we met. But I'm also still learning lessons and growing. 

I just wanted to know...

Hi, I‚Äôm looking for advice on whether I‚Äôd be justified in taking an employer to tribunal or if I should just move on.

I was offered a job and verbally confirmed a start date subject to reference checks. While filling in the paperwork I also submitted a seperate letter which was a Reasonable Adjustment request. 

I explained in the letter that my request was to have 1 midweek WFH day as a way to manage the social fatigue I get from heavy masking of my autism in the workplace. I did consider asking for 2 WFH days per week but this was the first time I‚Äôve ever advocated for myself and so I squashed down my request to the minimum I would need in order to not appear too demanding. 

The employer responded a couple of days later to say the job is full-time in the office and gave the reason as their their company culture is based on in-office collaboration and that WFH is only allowed ad-hoc for instances like personal emergencies.

I thought from their response they didn‚Äôt fully understand that I was asking for this for reason of a condition I have so I wrote back to them to further explain my condition, how it affects me and how this adjustment will help me stay at my best in the workplace.

They replied that they still couldn‚Äôt make this adjustment and that I ‚Äúalready knew‚Äù their position of being an in-office culture when I was at interview and they showed me around the building. This said that they have private grounds I can walk around and on-site tea and coffee facilities which o can use on my lunch break, and that the commute home would allow me time to unwind.  

I was disappointed with their response and felt that what they were suggesting wouldn‚Äôt address the issues I mentioned and tbh I felt like they were quite dismissive of something that has a profound effects on me (although I understand that is just my personal feeling). Their penultimate response was ‚Äúlet us know if there are any other accommodations you‚Äôd like us to consider‚Äù but I just replied saying that if they were unable to accommodate my request then I felt I had no choice but to withdraw my application. Their final response was ‚Äúsorry our attempts to accommodate you weren‚Äôt to your liking. We accept your withdrawal.‚Äù

Since then, I‚Äôve had to continue job hunting, attend multiple interviews, and claim job seekers allowance while looking for another role, which I eventually secured. However, I lost several weeks of earnings due to having to restart my job search.

I‚Äôve gone through ACAS early conciliation, but the employer denies any wrongdoing saying they  specifically ‚Äúyou knew the job was full-time on-site at interview stage‚Äù and ‚Äúwe considered your request and explained a business reason why we couldn‚Äôt accommodate it. We did however say we allow WFH on an ad-hoc basis in an event of an emergency and we did
Not rescind the offer because of your request, you withdrew your application so we don‚Äôt believe we have discriminated against you.‚Äù As a ‚ÄúGoodwill gesture‚Äù they offered ¬£500 for as a settlement. 

I worked out that not going ahead with the job offer cost me about ¬£1,800 in pro-rata wages and travel to their 2-stage off-site interview/assessment day so ¬£500 doesn‚Äôt make much of a dent in that.

ACAS have said I can either accept their offer, try again with asking for the amount I‚Äôve lost (although they‚Äôve already said they don‚Äôt think they owe me anything so would probably be pointless), or close the case down and take it to tribunal.

I‚Äôm second-guessing myself a bit though‚Äîam I right to pursue this, or am I wrong for even considering a claim? Was I unreasonable to ask for a WFH option? Should I just shut up and be grateful they even offered ¬£500 when they feel they‚Äôve done nothing wrong. Would a tribunal judge just laugh me out of the building?

They are still not perfect, but at least I learned a few things on the way.

So I got those KEF Coda / SP 1034 for 35‚Ç¨. A steal - since they were in working order with the OG T27 and B110 chassis both in good condition.  
But the original veneer fell off in some areas and was very scratched.  
They were not a matching pair and the connecting cable was somehow just put through a hole in the back - there were no cable terminals. One metal tag was missing.

I painstakingly removed the veneer and sanded the HDF wood underneath. Then I thought I could just paint them with either a rattle can or a paint roller.  
Boy was I wrong. Even with multiple layers of HDF primer the result was garbage.  
I tried a few times even, but the paint was first too patchy and then cracked from too many layers.  
I assume about 100‚Ç¨ went to the local department store and the products disappeared literally into thin air.  
They were angrily stored away and forgotten about. Every now and then I thought about them with a bit of hate.

Last week I decided to roll in the heavy artillery and just pried the HDF boards off the speakers. I then sanded the particleboard underneath and glued some beech boards on it.

Other things I did along the way:

\- Scanned the tag on the back, photoshopped it ""clean"" and ordered 2 replacement metal tags.  
\- Scanned the ""Inspection ticket"" and photoshopped it clean, soaked in a bit of coffee for a bit of yellowing  
\- Put in speaker terminals  
\- Made removable connectors for the tweeter inside the speakers  
\- Stapled the loose fabric on the covers  
\- Painted the front and back with new black  
\- Attached new ""drive-in"" nuts, because the old ones were loose and 1 was missing

* Endless coffee but zero focus
* Highlighting entire textbooks in neon yellow (as if that helps)
* ""Just one more YouTube video"" turning into a 3-hour rabbit hole
* Panic-studying the night before exams
* Wondering why I couldn't retain anything

My GPA was in free fall. I was sleeping 4 hours a night during finals week. My study notes looked like abstract art. Something had to change.

# The Turning Point

I decided to treat my studies like an RPG character progression. Instead of vague promises to ""study more,"" I started tracking actual hours of focused work. I set up a 30-day challenge for myself:

The Rules:

1. Track EVERY study session (length and quality)
2. No phone during focus blocks
3. Study with others for accountability
4. Visualize progress daily
5. Celebrate small wins

# Results

Week 1: Struggled to focus for 30 minutes straight. Kept reaching for my phone like an addict.

Week 2: Started using the peazehub for my challenge. The stats, leaderboard to help my gamification challenge

Week 3: Hit my first 4-hour deep work session without feeling drained. Started joining online study groups.

Week 4: Completed more quality study hours in one month than the entire previous semester.

# The Transformation:

* Before: 5-6 scattered hours/week of ""kind of studying""
* After: 50+ hours/week of actual, focused learning
* GPA: From 2.7 to 3.8 in one semester
* Sleep quality: Drastically improved (no more last-minute panic)
* Stress levels: Cut in half
* Retention: Actually, remembering what I study

# What I Learned

The biggest revelation wasn't finding the ""perfect system"" - it was realizing that *consistency beats intensity every single time.*

Those 45-minute focused sessions three times a day accomplished more than my previous all-nighters ever did. And tracking my progress visually made all the difference.

He comes from another country and moved towns to live with me so he doesn‚Äôt know anyone and he currently has no hobbies that take him out of the house. I work long hours, when I get home is always so happy to see me and of course I‚Äôm happy to see him but I‚Äôve also been around people at work all day and I want to switch off (I‚Äôm fairly introverted). He‚Äôs been very supportive in setting up immediate alone time for me when I get home, but he does interrupt roughly every 15 minutes, and when I get home I used to like to cook and eat immediately so I‚Äôm struggling to make him understand that as much as love how considerate he‚Äôs trying to be, it‚Äôs not the way I‚Äôm used to doing things and it doesn‚Äôt really relax me to wind down and then have to ‚Äòwind up‚Äô again to cook - or if he cooks, we end up eating later than I feel good about (I don‚Äôt sleep well if I eat too late). I know I need to adapt and compromise but I‚Äôm starting to feel suffocated. He‚Äôs just always there. And I really love this man so I feel awful. I know he‚Äôs lonely and I‚Äôm his social interaction right now but I‚Äôm getting so tired.
I‚Äôve been encouraging him to go out even if just for a coffee, today he did that - while I‚Äôm at work - and he will be home again by the time I get back at 1.30pm, I feel so frustrated.
What I need is the house - my house - to myself for a few hours. That‚Äôs all. But when I try to explain to him I feel like he thinks I‚Äôm being completely unappreciative of the many lovely things he does for me. And I‚Äôm not, I‚Äôve just been single for a long time, I‚Äôve always lived on my own and I need just a bit of space for an hour or two here and there - even if it was just once every other week. 

We‚Äôve been living together for 3 months and in that time I‚Äôve been in the house on my own twice, one time for a day and night and the other for about 7 hours when he had to be away for work things.

In addition to that I‚Äôm struggling to discuss finances with him specifically in relation to food, everything else is fine. I used to spend roughly 150 on food pm as I eat for free often at work and he would spend 300 living alone. He‚Äôs taken charge of ordering a food delivery online which is what he was used to doing before we lived together and our most recent monthly food bill came to 250 each, less for him but two thirds more for me! I‚Äôve tried talking to him about that too but he makes points about how he has always just split the bill in previous relationships and he doesn‚Äôt want to start having to buy food separately or deciding who pays for what item. As much as I agree with that, it‚Äôs adding 100 to my bills per month and I don‚Äôt get much more out of it, that‚Äôs crazy to me. I wish we had talked way more about this before we moved in together but it‚Äôs not like I can go back in time and have that conversation pre-move so I need to work out how to fix this in a way that feels fair to both of us now.

In general I love living with him but today I‚Äôm lingering at work because I don‚Äôt want to go home and that sucks, he‚Äôs my best friend.

1: Of Course A Divorce

Christiana‚Äôs POV.

The door to the lawyer's office closed behind me with a soft click. I had barely taken a step inside when the man behind the desk looked up from his papers, his expression serious and firm.

""Mrs. Davis, please take a seat. Your husband will join us shortly, but there are matters we need to discuss first,"" he said, gesturing to a chair in front of his imposing mahogany desk.

Curiosity ate at me as I settled into the chair. What could possibly be so urgent that Alex had summoned me here, to a lawyer‚Äôs office of all places? I watched the lawyer intently, waiting for him to continue.

He adjusted his glasses and cleared his throat. ""Mrs. Davis, your husband, Alex, has proposed a divorce.""

My breath caught in my throat, and I stared at him, stunned. ""Good heavens, a divorce?"" I managed to say, my voice was shaky.

The lawyer nodded, his face was of professional detachment. ""I know this comes as a surprise to you, but that's what Alex wants.""

I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, each beat was of shock and disbelief that coursed through me. Divorce? Alex and I had our problems, sure, but I never imagined it would come to this.

The lawyer continued, detailing Alex's grievances like he was reading from a script. ""He has cited several reasons for this decision. Firstly, he feels there is a disconnection in your communication. He also mentioned disagreements on financial matters and the future direction of your lives together.""

My mind was racing, struggling to process his words. Alex and I had our spats, but were they really enough to end our marriage?

""And finally,"" the lawyer said, looking up to meet my eyes, ""he mentioned the issue of children. You have been unable to conceive after two years of marriage. Alex is a man of considerable wealth, a billionaire, and he desires heirs to continue his legacy.""

A sharp pain pierced my chest, and tears stung my eyes. The lawyer's words felt like daggers, each one driving deeper into my heart. That Alex could sit here and tell this man such intimate, painful details about our lives‚Ä¶ It was almost too much to bear.

My hands trembled as I clasped them in my lap. I felt utterly betrayed, hurt beyond measure. The man I loved, the man I thought I knew, had laid bare our most private struggles and used them as reasons to end our marriage.

The lawyer paused, allowing the weight of his words to sink in. I struggled to compose myself, to fight back the tears that threatened to spill over. I couldn't believe it had come to this‚Äîmy own husband, my Alex, seeking to end our life together because of something as tragic and uncontrollable as infertility.

I sat there, unable to speak, my mind racing with a thousand thoughts and emotions. The future I had envisioned, the love I thought was unbreakable, was crumbling before my eyes. How could he do this to me? To us?

The door to the lawyer's office opened with a quiet creak, and Alex stepped inside. My heart skipped a beat, and I rose from my chair, meeting his gaze with tear-filled eyes.

""A divorce,"" I said, my voice trembling. ""That's what you truly want?""

""Yes,"" Alex replied, his tone devoid of any remorse. He clenched and unclenched his jaw before continuing, ""I can't do it anymore. This whole marriage is suffocating.""

The words hit me like a sledgehammer, and I struggled to remain standing, my heart aching with a pain I had never known. ""There are rumors,"" I began, swallowing hard, ""that you're seeing Bianca Lewis, the celebrity, the fashion icon. Is that true?""

Alex didn't flinch. ""Yes. You and I drifted apart several months ago, although we did get intimate but I was never satisfied. So, I started seeing Bianca, and we've been together for six months. I must say she makes me feel whole.""

It was as if he had punched me in the face. The rumors I had dismissed as baseless were true. Alex had cheated on me. My chest felt like it was about to explode from the overwhelming agony. I had defended him, convinced he would never betray me, but now, hearing it from his own lips, I was shattered.

""How could you do this to me?"" I demanded, my voice breaking. ""I loved you, Alex. I sacrificed everything to be with you. And now you want to leave me?""

Alex's expression remained cold, almost indifferent. ""Don't even think about begging me because once a man has made up his mind, nothing else can change it.""

His words were like daggers, each one slicing deeper into my already wounded heart. The man I thought I knew, the man I had devoted my life to, stood before me as a stranger. The future I had dreamed of was slipping away, replaced by a painful reality I was unprepared to face.

I felt an overwhelming sense of loss and betrayal. This was not how it was supposed to be. The love that had once bound us now lay in ruins. Destroyed by his desire for a divorce to part ways with me.

The lawyer watched silently, his eyes flicking between us. I could feel the walls closing in, the air growing heavy with the finality of Alex's decision.

I wanted to scream, to lash out, to make him see the depth of the pain he was causing. But all I could do was stand there, my heart breaking into pieces.

I took several deep breaths, trying to steady my raging nerves. The air felt thick with tension, but I forced myself to remain calm. Meeting Alex's gaze with a newfound boldness, I said, ""You want a divorce? Fine. I'll give it to you.""

Turning to the lawyer, I held out my hand. ""Give me the documents.""

The lawyer hesitated for a moment, then handed over the papers. I could feel Alex's eyes on me as I signed each page with a steady hand, willing myself not to break down. I would not give him the satisfaction of seeing me cry.

With the final signature in place, I stood up and walked over to Alex, holding the signed documents out to him. ""I've given you what you want.""

Alex took the papers, his expression unreadable. ""You can have the mansion,"" he said after a moment. ""And Davis Enterprises, along with the estate in the Hamptons. Plus, $50 million as compensation for all your suffering throughout the years.""

The words hung in the air, a list of material possessions meant to ease the pain of a broken heart. But they meant nothing to me now.

""I don't want any of it,"" I said, my voice steady and clear. ""Keep your money, your properties, your company. They won't heal the hurt you've caused.""

2: Pain

As I approached our home, my heart sank at the sight of my belongings scattered outside. My clothes, shoes, and personal items were piled haphazardly on the lawn. My stomach churned as I saw Alex's mother, Margret , standing on the porch, ordering the maids and butlers to throw my things out.

Margret never liked me. She always found ways to belittle me and poison Alex against me. Seeing her now, orchestrating my public humiliation, was almost too much to bear.

""Why are you doing this?"" I demanded, stepping forward, my voice shaking with a mix of anger and despair.

Margret's eyes flashed with contempt. Before I could react, she slapped me hard across the cheek. The sting was sharp and immediate, but what hurt more was the malice in her eyes. ""You dare talk? After everything you've put my son through?""

I chuckled bitterly, even as tears filled my eyes. ""I stood by Alex. I defended him, supported him through everything. You know nothing about what we've been through.""

Margret sneered, her voice dripping with disdain. ""Take your things and get the hell out. Barren woman, who knows nothing other than squandering my son's money. Alex already divorced you and he's bringing in someone better.""

The words were like knives, each one cutting deeper than the last. But I forced myself to smile through the tears. ""It's what you've always wanted, isn't it?""

Margret 's face twisted with rage. ""You ungrateful little wretch. You were never good enough for my son. You're a failure as a wife, and you couldn't even give him a child. Now he's found someone worthy of him, someone who isn't a useless drain on his fortune.""

The maids and butlers watched in silence, their eyes filled with pity and discomfort. Margret continued to berate me, each insult cutting deeper than the last. ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre something special? You‚Äôre nothing! My son deserves someone who can give him a real family, not a useless woman like you.‚Äù

Her harsh words hit me ever harder, with the eyes of the servants on us, witnessing my humiliation. 

""You're a disgrace, Christiana. A parasite who latched onto my son's success. You have no place here. Get out and never come back.""

I stood there, absorbing every harsh word, every insult, but refusing to let her see me break. I knew this was her moment of triumph, the culmination of years of disdain and bitterness. And in that moment, I realized I had to walk away with my head held high, for myself and for the life growing inside me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving,‚Äù I said quietly, gathering what little dignity I had left. ‚ÄúBut know this, Margaret. I loved your son with all my heart, and I sacrificed everything for him. One day, he‚Äôll realize the mistake he made. And when that day comes, I hope you can live with yourself.‚Äù

With that, I turned and began collecting my things, tears streaming down my face but my mind was already made up. I would rebuild my life, far away from this toxic one.

Margaret's harsh words echoed in my mind, but I couldn't dwell on them. I needed to find a place for my things and figure out my next move. I pulled out my phone and began calling people I thought I could rely on.

""Hi, it's Christiana. I need a place to store some of my things temporarily. Could you help me out?"" I asked, my voice trembling slightly.

There was a pause on the other end before the voice responded, ""I'm really sorry, Christiana, but I can't help you right now. It's... it's complicated.""

My heart sank, but I tried to stay hopeful. I made another call. ""Hey, it's Christiana. I‚Äôm in a bit of a situation. Can I bring some of my stuff over?""

""Christiana, I heard about what happened. I don‚Äôt think it's a good idea. I‚Äôm sorry,"" the response came, tinged with discomfort.

Each call ended the same way, and the realization hit me hard: Alex had already been around, telling everyone his version of the story. In their eyes, I was the villain. No one wanted to help me. 

I tried to access my bank account, hoping to at least get a hotel room for the night. But when I swiped my card at an ATM, the screen flashed, ‚ÄúTransaction declined.‚Äù I tried again, and the same message appeared. Panic rising, I logged into my account on my phone, only to see a message: ‚ÄúAccount frozen.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no, no,‚Äù I whispered, my hands shaking. Alex had frozen my accounts. He had access to them and now, he had taken everything. I was in pain, with absolutely nothing left. My heart felt like it was being squeezed in a vice. I had no money, no home, and no one to turn to.

As night fell, I wandered aimlessly through the streets, clutching my bags and hoping to find somewhere safe. The city lights blurred through my tears, and the cold air bit at my skin. I felt utterly lost, each step heavier than the last.

Suddenly, I felt a rough hand grab my arm. ‚ÄúHey! What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I cried out, but another hand yanked my bags away. Panic surged through me as I saw two men running off with everything I had left.

‚ÄúNo! Please, stop! Help!‚Äù I screamed, but my cries echoed unanswered through the empty streets. The men disappeared into the night, leaving me with nothing but my purse and phone.

I collapsed onto the pavement, sobbing uncontrollably. My entire world had crumbled, and I was left alone in the darkness. I felt utterly broken, my spirit crushed by the weight of my circumstances.

With trembling hands, I fumbled for my phone in my purse. It was the only lifeline I had left, the only connection to the world outside this nightmare. Through tear-blurred vision, I dialed a number, praying for someone, anyone, t

o answer and offer a tad of hope in this dark hour.

3: Pregnant? Incredulous!

Two weeks had passed since my world had crumbled to dust. My days were now spent scrubbing floors and sweeping at a dingy restaurant, the smell of grease and old food clinging to my clothes. 

My boss, a perpetually sour-faced woman named Karen, took every opportunity to remind me of my fall from grace. We were only two waiters and one was on leave.

""Christiana, get over here and clean this mess!"" Karen barked, pointing to a spill near the kitchen. ""And hurry up! Table three is waiting for their drinks!""

The restaurant was overwhelming, with rowdy customers demanding my attention. I rushed from table to table, my hands red and raw from constant cleaning, trying to keep up with the never-ending stream of orders and complaints.

""Miss! Where's my coffee?"" a gruff man called out, waving his hand impatiently. ""And bring some more napkins while you're at it!""

As I hurried to fulfill the customers' requests, the sound of the television caught my ear. The news anchor's voice cut through the chaos, and my heart sank as I recognized the topic of discussion.

""In today's celebrity news, billionaire Alex Davis has finalized his divorce from his wife Christiana Davis and is now officially with fashion icon Bianca.""

I froze, the tray in my hands trembling. On the screen, images and videos of Alex and Bianca flashed by, the two of them looking every bit the perfect couple. They smiled for the cameras, their hands entwined, their eyes filled with a happiness that felt like a knife twisting in my heart.

The customers around me began to chatter, their voices blending into a cacophony of judgment and gossip.

""Did you hear about Alex Davis? Finally got rid of that wife of his,"" one man said with a laugh. ""Can't blame him, though. She couldn't even give him a kid.""

""Yeah, I heard she was pretty useless,"" another woman chimed in. ""Bianca is a much better match for him. She's gorgeous and successful.""

My face burned with humiliation and pain as I listened to their cruel words. They didn't know they were talking about me, the woman who was serving them. Each comment was like a dagger, cutting deeper into my already shattered heart.

""I feel bad for that ex-wife of his,"" a lone voice spoke up. I turned to see a middle-aged woman shaking her head. ""Imagine how she must feel, seeing her husband move on so quickly. It‚Äôs just so sad.""

Karen's shrill voice snapped me back to reality. ""Christiana, stop dawdling and get back to work! Those tables won't serve themselves!""

I swallowed the lump in my throat and forced myself to keep moving. As I continued to serve the oblivious customers, their words echoed in my mind, each one a reminder of my perceived failures and the life I had lost.

The image of Alex and Bianca haunted me, their smiles mocking my misery. How had things gone so wrong? How could the man I had loved so deeply, sacrificed so much for, move on so easily? 

Oh, I almost forgot. She had always been there.

The pain was almost unbearable, but I held myself together, refusing to let them see me break. 

As the night wore on, the news segment continued, detailing the glamorous life Alex and Bianca were now living. I scrubbed the floors harder, trying to erase the hurt with every stroke of the brush. But no amount of scrubbing could cleanse the ache in my heart.

By the time my shift ended, I was exhausted, both physically and emotionally. I sank into a chair in the back of the restaurant, the weight of the day pressing down on me. Tears welled up in my eyes, but I blinked them back. I couldn't afford to cry. Not here, not now.

Instead, I took a deep breath and stared at my reflection in the dirty window. I was stronger than this.

No one had come to my aid when I needed it most. Friends turned their backs, and even those I thought I could rely on had chosen sides, believing the lies Alex spread about me. It was Karen, the hot-tempered owner of the small restaurant, who took pity on me. She offered me food and shelter in exchange for my work.

Scrubbing floors and serving unruly customers was a far cry from the life I had known. Each day was a struggle to hold onto my dignity while performing menial tasks, enduring Karen's never-ending criticism, and facing the pitying or judgmental glances of those who had heard the news when they by chance ran into me.

‚Ä¶

One afternoon, after enduring another grueling shift, I found myself staring into the bathroom mirror, my reflection a ghost of the woman I once was. 

My eyes, red and puffy from lack of sleep and constant tears, stared back at me. Suddenly, a wave of nausea hit me hard, and I barely made it to the toilet before retching violently. My body trembled, and I felt weak and lightheaded as I sat on the cold tile floor, trying to regain my composure.

Two hours later, I found myself in a sterile doctor's office, the harsh fluorescent lights making everything seem even more surreal. Dr. Patel, a kindly older man with a gentle demeanor, had just returned with the results of my blood test. 

""Ms. Christiana,"" he began, his voice calm but serious, ""you're pregnant.""

The words hung in the air, almost incomprehensible. ""Pregnant?"" I echoed, my voice barely more than a whisper. ""How... how can that be? I was told I couldn't have children.""

Dr. Patel gave me a sympathetic look. ""Sometimes, the body can surprise us. But I assure you, the test is accurate. You're approximately three weeks along.""

I shook my head, struggling to process the information. ""No, there must be some mistake. I was told I was barren. This can't be right."" My hands trembled as I clutched at the chair's armrests, trying to anchor myself in this revelation.

He handed me the test results, the undeniable proof staring up at me in black and white. I traced the words with my finger, still in shock. Pregnant. How could this be?

""You're sure?"" I asked again, my voice breaking. 

Dr. Patel nodded, his expression gentle but firm. ""I'm certain, Ms. Christiana. Congratulations.""

Congratulations? The word felt foreign, almost mocking. I was at a loss for words. Pregnant with Alex's child. The last time we had been intimate was ten days before the divorce. It hadn't been an act of passion or love; it had felt more like a duty to him. He didn't hold me lovingly, didn't kiss me. His mind had clearly been elsewhere. And now, despite everything, I was pregnant?

I left the doctor's office in a daze, the world around me feeling distant and unreal. The irony of the situation was overwhelming. 

Alex had divorced me because I couldn't give him children, and now, he

re I was, carrying his child. The universe had a cruel sense of humor.

4: Meeting Again

The plane's engines hummed softly as I settled into my first-class seat, looking out the window at the clouds. 

Five years had passed since I left this city, heartbroken and destitute. Now, I was returning as a successful businesswoman, the CEO of a thriving empire known nationwide. My brands, ranging from high-end fashion to eco-friendly cosmetics, were household names. The transformation felt surreal.

My personal assistant, Grace, was busy typing away on her laptop a few seats down. Beside her, my security team ensured that everything was in order. They were all part of the group that had become essential in my new life. My success had brought wealth, influence, and an entirely new set of responsibilities.

Among my group, however, the most important were my children. Ethan and Emma, my five-year-old twins, were currently engaged in a heated debate, their voices carrying through the luxurious cabin. They approached me, their faces filled with the intensity of their argument.

""Mom, tell Emma she's wrong!"" Ethan demanded, his blue eyes sparkling with frustration and excitement.

""No, Mom, Ethan is wrong!"" Emma retorted, her hands on her hips and a stubborn pout on her lips.

I couldn't help but smile at their antics. They were both so smart and full of life, each with their own unique personality. Ethan was logical and methodical, while Emma was creative and fiercely independent.

""Okay, okay, calm down,"" I said, holding up my hands. ""What's the argument about this time?""

""Ethan says that the capital of Australia is Canberra, but I said it's Sydney,"" Emma explained, her eyes wide with determination.

I chuckled softly. ""Ethan is right, sweetheart. The capital of Australia is Canberra, not Sydney.""

Emma's face fell, her pout deepening. ""But Sydney is the biggest city. It should be the capital.""

I pulled her close, kissing the top of her head. ""Sometimes the biggest city isn't the capital. It's a bit confusing, but it's a good thing to learn.""

Ethan beamed with pride, while Emma sulked for a moment before finally giving in with a sigh. ""Okay, Ethan, you win.""

""Thanks, Mom,"" Ethan said, giving me a quick hug before running back to his seat, victorious.

Emma lingered, her disappointment still evident. I cupped her cheek, looking into her eyes. ""You know, you were right about Sydney being the biggest city. That's something special too.""

She smiled up at me, her earlier defeat forgotten. ""Thanks, Mom.""

As she scampered back to her seat, I leaned back and took a deep breath. Moments like these reminded me of how far we had come. From the depths of despair to the heights of success, my children were my greatest achievement and my most precious treasure.

Returning to the city I had left behind felt like closing a chapter and beginning a new one. My heart swelled with pride and anticipation. This time, I was not the broken woman who had walked away with nothing. I had everything which made my life whole.

Five years ago, my world had turned upside down. Discovering I was pregnant after Alex left me was both a blessing and a challenge. With no family to turn to‚Äîbeing an orphan meant I was truly alone‚ÄîI had to muster every ounce of strength I had left.

I saved up what little money I earned from scrubbing floors and sweeping at Karen's restaurant. It was tough work, but Karen's kindness and the roof over my head kept me going. Every night, I counted my savings, dreaming of a better life for my unborn children. I knew staying there was not an option; I needed a fresh start, away from the pain and humiliation of the past.

With enough money saved, I left Karen‚Äôs place and moved to a new city, far from the memories that haunted me. I found a small, rundown apartment and started from scratch. My first venture was a tiny boutique‚Äîbarely more than a closet‚Äîwhere I sold handmade dresses and accessories. The work was grueling, and the profits were meager, but I poured my heart into it.

Pregnancy was no walk in the park, especially without anyone to lean on. I faced the morning sickness, the doctor visits, and the overwhelming fear of the unknown alone. But every kick, every flutter from my babies gave me the strength to keep going. When the time came, I gave birth to Ethan and Emma. They were my miracles, my reason for fighting harder than ever before.

Raising twins on my own was a monumental task. Sleepless nights, endless feedings, and the constant juggle between motherhood and building a business tested me in ways I never imagined. But giving up was never an option. I wanted to prove to myself and to the world that I could rise above the challenges.

The boutique grew slowly but steadily. Word of mouth spread, and soon, my unique designs caught the eye of a few influential people. Orders started pouring in, and I reinvested every penny into expanding my business. I moved into a bigger space, hired staff, and launched my brand nationwide. The trials were many, but so were the triumphs.

Ethan and Emma grew up in the midst of it all, always understanding that their mother was working to create a better life for them. They were my greatest cheerleaders, their laughter and love my daily inspiration.

Now, as I sat on that flight back to the city I had left in shambles, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a deep sense of pride. I had built an empire from nothing. My brands were synonymous with elegance and innovation, and I had secured a future for my children that I had once only dreamed of.

‚Ä¶

The flight finally landed, and the hum of activity around us grew louder as we prepared to disembark. I straightened my jacket and turned to my team, giving them last-minute instructions.

""Grace, make sure the car service knows we‚Äôre on our way. Sam, coordinate with the hotel about our late check-in. Lisa, double-check the kids' bags,"" I said, my voice clear and authoritative.

My personal maid, Lisa, nodded and moved to check Ethan and Emma's bags. The children, bubbling with excitement, were being particularly giggly and playful. Ethan kept trying to tickle Emma, who squealed in delight, her laughter ringing through the cabin.

As we moved through the airport, I kept an eye on them, smiling at their antics. They were truly the light of my life, their joy infectious even in the midst of a hectic schedule. We made our way to the waiting area where our cars were supposed to be, my team forming a protective circle around us.

""Mommy, look! I'm a superhero!"" Ethan shouted, darting ahead with his arms outstretched like an airplane. Emma, not to be outdone, tried to catch up, her little legs pumping furiously.

""Ethan, slow down!"" I called out, but it was too late. In his enthusiasm, Ethan collided with a man surrounded by his own group of P.A.s and bodyguards.

The man looked down at Ethan, who stared up at him with wide eyes, momentarily speechless. I hurried over, my heart racing.

""I'm so sorry,"" I began, but my words trailed off as the man removed his sunglasses and called my name.

""Christiana?""

I froze, my breath catching in my throat.

It‚Äôs been 4 months since you called it quits and pumayag na rin ako kasi sa 2mos na naging tayo, I felt so hollow. I never begged you to stay cause that‚Äôs not me. 

2mos lang naging tayo but the game of thinking what is this, what are we cost me 2.5yrs of my life.

We started out texting each other in 2022. We went out on 1 coffee date. After that, I felt the coldness na kaya I decided na wag na lang mag-reply sa last text mo. Kasi ramdam kong pilit na lang ang mga replies mo. Umiwas na ako.

Then Feb 2023, you greeted me a Happy Valentine‚Äôs day. I wear my heart on my sleeve so I caved in. Lumabas tayo that weekend. It was fun. We went for light drinking sa Malate. Cuentuhan until closing na ng 6AM haha. Then hinatid mo ako at my place and you went your way. Nasundan ng mga paminsan minsang kamustahan and mga asaran. Then Sept 2023, I asked you thru text if ano ba tayo? Like are we just friends na nagkakamustahan once in a while. You told me na gusto mo nang i-next level pero wala kang oras kasi you are just soooo busy but it‚Äôs up to me if ano gusto ko. I told you auko ng ganung set-up so we ended our conversation there.

So ako, nung 2024, I decided to go back to hiking, to traveling and to doing things para sa sarili ko. I hiked Mt. Apo last Feb 2024 and the I was exhilarated. Hindi na kita naiisip nun. But then one night when I was in Bora, i received a message from an unknown number. Naisip ko baka ikaw kasi ung line of messaging. And ikaw nga, asking me out. Pagkabalik ko manila, we started going out again. This time, mas consistent ka na. And months after, I asked na if ano tayo and that i dont wanna go back to ‚Äúgo with the flow‚Äù kasi ganun na tayo last 2023. So before that day ended, naging tayo. August 11, 2024.

Okay pa tayo the first few weeks. We even celebrated your bday together. I prepared foods kasi may mga onting bisita din. But after that, bakit biglang parang lip service na lang ang pangungumusta mo sakin? Minsan in a week, 2x more lang ako kamustahin? I opened this up to you and nag-effort ka naman to do more. Thankful ako na hindi ako naglalabas ng pera when we go out. But ang love language ko ay time and touch. I told you this. 

Umokay naman tayo for few days then come October, bakit hindi ko man lang ako madalaw ng every weekend? May sasakyan ka. Cainta ka lang naman. Makati lang ako. 

Kaya when you told me on October 27 that I am not good for you, that you are not ready, hindi ko na nilaban.

Pero just today, I saw a story posted by a high school classmate (JA) who I can say, okay kami. You were in that photo with her and with JA‚Äôs friend‚Äôs husband and kid. Sa DUBAI. When I saw the photo, I instantly replied telling her na, it‚Äôs good to see you kahit sa photo lang and I asked if you are working there na. I was left on seen lang, which is unusual since we reply and comment to each other‚Äôs story reactions. Hindi na ako nag-message ulit kay JA. 

Hindi ka pala ready sakin, bakit ka pa bumalik? I know my fault din ako pero ako na ang unang umiwas and when you came back, nakalimutan ko na ung pain ulit kaya I welcomed you back. 

If in case kayo man ni JA, bakit naman ung nasa same circle of kakilala ko pa? Sana lang din walang overlap. 

As I type this now, I shed some tears pero kahit sobrang sakit, ung luha ko di na tulad ng dati na dire-diretso. May be cause drained na ako. Minahal kita. Kaso you were looking for something casual lang ata and I dont do casual. Pero sana naiparamdam ko sayo ung pagmamahal ko.

My friends who happen to be your classmates in elementary kept on asking me what happened. But I never told them any since aukong masira ung image mo sa kanila. I know you consider them as friends and gusto ko pa rin na kapag umuuwi ka satin, maaya mo sila sa inuman. 

I am typing this here to remind myself na tama na. I deleted all of our remaining photos na din, even screenshots. Of course, I may think of you at times but the thought of a fairy tale ending of us is no longer there. I may cry, I wont deny it, but that‚Äôs because I want to feel the pain so that one day, I wont feeling anything when I hear your name or see you in a somebody else‚Äôs story.

This isn‚Äôt a misogynistic rant, I‚Äôm bisexual anyway. 


So the other night I got rejected, which is fine, but now I‚Äôm back at square one. I‚Äôm the kind of person who can‚Äôt pursue more than one person at a time, it‚Äôs just not how I work. I‚Äôm not hung up on the person, but I‚Äôm more frustrated at my options now trying to date as a Gen z man in 2025.

I‚Äôm bi, my options should be double. Yeah I wish. It seems like every man I‚Äôm interested in is straight, or only interested in hookups, and I can‚Äôt do hookups, I need to be emotionally connected to the person over the course of a few dates. Every woman I‚Äôm interested in, is either lesbian, not interested in me, or already in a relationship.

I‚Äôve had 0 luck on the dating apps, probably because I‚Äôm not interested in hookups, I‚Äôm also not jacked, I‚Äôm in shape and probably like a 6-7/10. It feels like on dating apps, men and women of my generation, are shallow, and there to have sex with the most attractive person they can find, they‚Äôre not interested in real connections or actually trying to get to know someone.

Additionally, I live in the North east United States, and trying to talk to strangers in real life is culturally somewhat frowned upon, not as if I really have the social skills to walk up and start conversations with everyone and anyone im interested in. Somehow, even now the places you used to be able to go to meet people, like the gym, the bar, coffee shop, it‚Äôs taboo to try and flirt with people there. How am I supposed to meet anyone? I guess through other friends, but honestly I don‚Äôt have many friends, and most of my friends are straight single men, who either can‚Äôt set me up, or don‚Äôt want to. I just feel lost, I got out of a toxic relationship last year, and now I‚Äôm ready to date again, but I don‚Äôt know where to start or to look.

Genuinely curious.,"I want to preface this by saying I‚Äôm not trying to talk down or criticize, just trying to understand the cultural differences so I know what to expect and how to adapt in the future.

Where I‚Äôm from, there‚Äôs a really high sense of urgency when it comes to service. If you walk into a caf√© or restaurant, things move quickly, orders are taken fast, and employees are constantly aware of how to keep things moving efficiently. But I‚Äôve noticed that in most places in Medell√≠n, that urgency just isn‚Äôt there.

For example, I recently went to grab a croissant, and there were two employees behind the counter, casually chatting. No line, no other orders, nothing urgent happening. I waited for 12 minutes while they occasionally glanced at the screen, picked something up, set it down, and generally moved at what felt like a very slow pace. The croissant was right there. All they had to do was grab it, put it in a bag, and hand it to me. A similar thing happened at a different place when I ordered coffee, it felt like it took forever, even though the shop wasn‚Äôt busy.

I‚Äôm really curious about the mindset behind this. Is it just a more relaxed work culture? Is there an emphasis on not rushing? Is it a difference in how service workers are trained? I totally respect it and am learning to be more patient, but I‚Äôm genuinely trying to understand why this happens.

""Just a minute!""

He didn't immediately turn around when he heard the soft, proper, southern voice of a young woman. He finished scraping the last bit of bacon grease into the grease trap angrily before tossing the spatula down beside the large flat top grill. The metal spatula made a loud clink as he wiped his hands aggressively on a towel. Walter was late once again. Manager Carla had called less than 30 minutes ago and nonchalantly said, 

*""Lukas, Walter is caught up and will be a few hours late. I'm going to need you to work overtime.""*

*""Caught up?! He's not caught up, he's high!""* He had replied infuriated. 

*""Lukas...we are a team. I need you to cover for him please and thank you.""* 

She hung up before he could protest. Walter was her loser nephew. He was always late or missing shifts and others had to pick up the slack. Carla looked past it... she always looked past it. Lukas cussed under his breath before pasting a fake smile on his sweaty face and turned around. His eyes widened and his smile faltered giving way to flushed cheeks as he stared at the beautiful young woman before him. She was black with medium brown skin and long braids that hung down to her waist. The braids were beautiful, uniform with some adorned with silver hair jewelry. Her large brown eyes were shaded by long eyelashes. A small, cute, button nose sat perfectly on her face above gorgeously shaped full lips that shimmered in the light. One of the straps of her floral sundress slipped from her shoulder onto her upper arm. Her skin glistened and she gave off a pleasant scent of coconut and shea butter. A silver cross necklace hung around her neck matching silver jangles that clinked around her wrists. She was shapely and he struggled not to stare at the bit of cleavage that showed from her dress as he cleared his throat. 

""How can I help you?"" He stammered over his words. 

She smiled awkwardly, her perfectly shaped eyebrows furrowing in worry. ""Um, well, I was driving through town when my car started having issues. It started smoking and making noises. I just managed to pull in here before it clunked out on me.""

""Oh gosh! That's terrible."" He replied coming from behind the bar. 

""I'm not from here and my phone didn't pull up any shops... Do you know where I can find a mechanic?"" She asked politely. 

""Only mechanic in this town is George."" Old man Samuel responded finishing up his coffee. 

Old man Samuel tossed $5 on the counter as he got up from his stool. He gave Lukas and the pretty young woman a polite nod before exiting the diner. Lukas walked around and picked up the $5 and smiled warmly at the young woman. 

""Take a seat while I ring this up. I'll call George for you once I'm done."" 

The young woman nodded in agreement and sat at a stool. She looked around at the details of the old fashioned diner. It was charming from its checkerboard floor, red pleather booths, matching red pleather stools with shiny silver rims, large jukebox, and a large 1950's red car bumper decorating the wall above the jukebox. Kippy's Diner sat printed in bold, red letters on the opposite wall with *since 1955* written beneath it. The place smelled delicious, like fresh coffee, bacon and eggs. She stared at the smiling short order fry cook as he snuck glances at her between making his transaction. His light blue eyes sparkled. His cheeks looked rosy against his otherwise peachy skin. Dark blonde hair peeked out from underneath his white and red bandana. He licked his reddish-pink lips as he concentrated. His pointy nose shined a bit, probably from sweat as he closed the drawer and placed $3 in a tip jar. 

""Why are you here alone?"" She asked. 

""Oh, the waitresses will be here in about 10 or 15 minutes... We're dead right after lunch as you can see so it's no problem. While you wait, do you want something to eat or drink?"" He asked smiling. 

""Um, I'll take a Dr. Pepper if you have that?"" 

""Yeah, sure!"" He responded way more enthusiastically than he intended to. 

""How much?"" She asked retrieving a small purse from a well blended pocket in her dress. 

""Oh! It's on the house."" Lukas responded smiling widely. 

Lukas rushed over and washed his hands behind the bar. He grabbed a clean cup and filled it with ice before filling it with Dr. Pepper. He handed it to her with a straw and a polite smile, reminding himself not to come off as too eager. She took the Dr. Pepper with a thanks and slowly sipped it through the straw, closing her eyes momentarily enjoying its cool and refreshing taste. 

""I'll call George now...May I know your name so I can let him know who has the car issues?"" He asked trying to look serious. 

""Oh yeah, My name is Aria. Thank you so much for helping me and for the soda."" She replied smiling. 

Her teeth were perfect and her smile made her even more beautiful. Lukas felt his heart rate increase as he picked up his cell from under the counter. He dialed George who answered on the third ring. He explained the situation and walked outside to peek at the car as George asked about it. An off white 1980's Ford Sierra sat in the parking lot with a bit of white smoke rising from its hood. Lukas reentered the diner after hanging up from George. 

""He's coming right over."" He said to Aria who turned around holding her cup. 

""Great! Thank you.""

George arrived after 15 minutes. He was an older black man with a full beard that was black except the gray hairs on his chin. He was slightly overweight with a small Afro that blended his black and gray hair in a peppery ensemble. He wore a slightly too small tan t-shirt and jeans that were stained with car oil. His eyes were kind but dark. His voice was deep, southern and soothing. His face and hands held years of hard labor on them. His nails were dirty as he held a large auto mechanic tool box in his right hand. He asked Aria to pop her hood politely as he discreetly admired her beauty. Lukas wanted to watch but a small group of people entered the diner along with Marlene the waitress who smelled like cigarette smoke and perfume. She let out a heavy breath with she saw Lukas before using her phone's  screen as a mirror to check that her brown hair was still slicked back properly before washing her hands.

""Walter late again I see."" She said in her raspy voice, her dark blue eyes glimmering with irritation. 

""Yep, and she didn't even bother with an excuse this time. Just demanded I work overtime."" Lukas responded taking his place in front of the flat top grill. 

Marlene rolled her eyes and shook her head as the evening waitress Stephanie entered with a wide smile and boisterous ""hey y'all!"" The few customers greeted her as they looked at the small laminated menus. Stephanie was young, 19 and a college student. She worked part-time. She was cute, short and pale skinned with gray eyes and light brown hair. She didn't hide her crush on Lukas and was excited to see that he was still there instead of Walter who she found repulsive as he usually smelled of weed, alcohol and body odor. He always hit on her inappropriately which made her skin crawl. George and Aria reentered the diner with Aria looking gloomy. 

""How's the car?"" Lukas asked turning around. 

""She has a cracked engine block. It's bad. She's gonna need a replacement. I'm gonna have to order it. Might be a couple days... I'm about to tow her car now before the storm rolls in."" George replied wiping his hands on an oily rag before leaving. 

Aria took a seat at the counter and rubbed her hands through her braids. Lukas walked over staring at her sympathetically while Stephanie watched frowning as she put away her purse under the counter. 

""Looks like you'll be stuck here for a couple days...I'm sorry."" He said softly. 

Aria looked up and shrugged. ""I guess it can't be helped...Is there a motel around here?"" She asked. 

""Oh honey, you don't want to stay there. It ain't safe. Especially for someone that looks like you."" Marlene said placing a server pad and pen in her apron and grabbing two glasses of ice water. She walked over to one of the booths with a smile. 

""She's right, unfortunately."" Lukas replied. 

""Well where should I stay?"" Aria asked worriedly. 

Before Lukas could answer more customers entered in noisily. Lukas excused himself as Marlene stuck an order ticket above the grill. Stephanie narrowed her eyes at Aria as she passed by to greet and serve the new customers. The Diner had suddenly become lively. One of the customers started the jukebox, playing Toni Braxton's Un-break My Heart . The smell of grits, bacon, sausage, eggs, hash browns and coffee filled the air. Aria watched as Lukas, Marlene and Stephanie worked as a well oiled machine. Lukas worked quickly, getting out orders fast. He rung a small bell whenever an order was complete and one of the waitresses would come and gather it up, balancing plates on their arms with the skills of well practiced acrobats. Lukas turned around and sat a plate of scrambled eggs, sausage and hash browns in front of Aria. 

""It's on the house, I hope this is okay?"" He said with a smile.

""Oh, thank you so much! Yes, it looks delicious."" Aria replied.

Clouds rolled in as the sky darkened outside. Thunder sounded loudly as a sudden heavy rain started pouring blocking the bright late spring sun that had just been shining brightly. Aria peeked out of the small window next to the soda machine before placing $10 in the tip jar. She started eating closing her eyes occasionally as she did. The food was well seasoned and tasty. She savored the flavor as the creeking of the diner doors sounded off again. She turned around and slowly removed her fork from her mouth. Marlene walked by greeting the new guest but stopped mid sentence. The loud chattering of the customers slowly all came to a halt as people noticed the new visitors that entered. The sudden quietness except the melodic singing of Toni Braxton caused Lukas to turn from the grill and face the door. 

Three tall men had entered. Each looked to be almost 7 ft (213.36 cm) in height. They were pale, pasty. Not the kind of pale that came from albinism as their skin looked powdery and slightly synthetic. Their eyes were dark, not dark brown but deep black. Their faces were long and strangely muscular. Their hair was silky black and slicked down neatly. They had black, thick eyebrows but neither of them had any visible eyelashes. Their lips were thin and pale. They were all identical in appearance, down to their choice of elegant 3 piece, double breasted red and dark gray suits and off black, polished wing tipped shoes. Aria felt instantly uncomfortable as they all smiled in unison, revealing perfectly white, large teeth. Stephanie frowned as she grabbed an empty coffee mug from a table. Marlene cleared her throat and continued her greeting with a shaky voice, telling the three gentleman they could sit wherever. 

The men remained silent but continued smiling as the thunder sounded loudly and lightening streaked across the gray sky. Aria placed her fork on her plate and got up from the stool. She walked around the counter, stopping before going completely behind it as a bad feeling entered her chest. One of the men watched her intently with his dark eyes, his wide smile never leaving his pale face. Suddenly, the men opened their mouths wide in unison as their eyes rolled back into their heads. Stephanie screamed, dropping the coffee mug breaking it. Some customers jumped from their booths with expressions of horror painted across their confused faces. The men jaws dropped low, making popping sounds like breaking bones as long, barbed, pale tongues protruded from their gaping mouths. The man on the right tongue shot out grabbing a customer around his neck, snatching him violently from the booth as his wife screamed desperately, attempting to hold his legs. The barbs cut deep into his flesh but his blood did not spill, instead it ran up the long tongue and into the man's mouth. Within seconds he was pale and limp as the man dropped him and snatched his screaming wife, quickly draining her of her blood and allowing her to join her husband in death. 

The man in the middle seized Marlene, lifting her high into the air. She kicked, struggling to grab the tongue as the barbs pierced into her neck and hands. The man drained her blood within moments. The customers yelled in terror as they desperately scrambled attempting to run from their tables to the back of the diner. Stephanie yelled for Marlene whose body had become limp. The man on the left aimed for Aria, his tongue shooting out so fast she couldn't react quickly enough to move. Lukas grabbed her arm and snatched her forcefully to his side before the tongue could reach her. The man's eyes returned to their proper position as he looked at Lukas and Aria perplexed. The other two had disregard their victims as they snatched others with speed and precision, plucking the screaming people like flowers from the ground as they attempted to escape. The fearful shrieking and chaos grew more intense, overshadowing Toni Braxton's He Wasn't Man Enough that played loudly in the background.

She smiled awkwardly, her perfectly shaped eyebrows furrowing in worry. ""Um, well, I was driving through town when my car started having issues. It started smoking and making noises. I just managed to pull in here before it clunked out on me.""

""Oh gosh! That's terrible."" He replied coming from behind the bar. 

""I'm not from here and my phone didn't pull up any shops... Do you know where I can find a mechanic?"" She asked politely. 

""Only mechanic in this town is George."" Old man Samuel responded finishing up his coffee. 

Old man Samuel tossed $5 on the counter as he got up from his stool. He gave Lukas and the pretty young woman a polite nod before exiting the diner. Lukas walked around and picked up the $5 and smiled warmly at the young woman. 

""Take a seat while I ring this up. I'll call George for you once I'm done."" 

The young woman nodded in agreement and sat at a stool. She looked around at the details of the old fashioned diner. It was charming from its checkerboard floor, red pleather booths, matching red pleather stools with shiny silver rims, large jukebox, and a large 1950's red car bumper decorating the wall above the jukebox. Kippy's Diner sat printed in bold, red letters on the opposite wall with *since 1955* written beneath it. The place smelled delicious, like fresh coffee, bacon and eggs. She stared at the smiling short order fry cook as he snuck glances at her between making his transaction. His light blue eyes sparkled. His cheeks looked rosy against his otherwise peachy skin. Dark blonde hair peeked out from underneath his white and red bandana. He licked his reddish-pink lips as he concentrated. His pointy nose shined a bit, probably from sweat as he closed the drawer and placed $3 in a tip jar. 

""Why are you here alone?"" She asked. 

""Oh, the waitresses will be here in about 10 or 15 minutes... We're dead right after lunch as you can see so it's no problem. While you wait, do you want something to eat or drink?"" He asked smiling. 

""Um, I'll take a Dr. Pepper if you have that?"" 

""Yeah, sure!"" He responded way more enthusiastically than he intended to. 

""How much?"" She asked retrieving a small purse from a well blended pocket in her dress. 

""Oh! It's on the house."" Lukas responded smiling widely. 

Lukas rushed over and washed his hands behind the bar. He grabbed a clean cup and filled it with ice before filling it with Dr. Pepper. He handed it to her with a straw and a polite smile, reminding himself not to come off as too eager. She took the Dr. Pepper with a thanks and slowly sipped it through the straw, closing her eyes momentarily enjoying its cool and refreshing taste. 

""I'll call George now...May I know your name so I can let him know who has the car issues?"" He asked trying to look serious. 

""Oh yeah, My name is Aria. Thank you so much for helping me and for the soda."" She replied smiling. 

Her teeth were perfect and her smile made her even more beautiful. Lukas felt his heart rate increase as he picked up his cell from under the counter. He dialed George who answered on the third ring. He explained the situation and walked outside to peek at the car as George asked about it. An off white 1980's Ford Sierra sat in the parking lot with a bit of white smoke rising from its hood. Lukas reentered the diner after hanging up from George. 

""He's coming right over."" He said to Aria who turned around holding her cup. 

""Great! Thank you.""

George arrived after 15 minutes. He was an older black man with a full beard that was black except the gray hairs on his chin. He was slightly overweight with a small Afro that blended his black and gray hair in a peppery ensemble. He wore a slightly too small tan t-shirt and jeans that were stained with car oil. His eyes were kind but dark. His voice was deep, southern and soothing. His face and hands held years of hard labor on them. His nails were dirty as he held a large auto mechanic tool box in his right hand. He asked Aria to pop her hood politely as he discreetly admired her beauty. Lukas wanted to watch but a small group of people entered the diner along with Marlene the waitress who smelled like cigarette smoke and perfume. She let out a heavy breath with she saw Lukas before using her phone's  screen as a mirror to check that her brown hair was still slicked back properly before washing her hands.

""Walter late again I see."" She said in her raspy voice, her dark blue eyes glimmering with irritation. 

""Yep, and she didn't even bother with an excuse this time. Just demanded I work overtime."" Lukas responded taking his place in front of the flat top grill. 

Marlene rolled her eyes and shook her head as the evening waitress Stephanie entered with a wide smile and boisterous ""hey y'all!"" The few customers greeted her as they looked at the small laminated menus. Stephanie was young, 19 and a college student. She worked part-time. She was cute, short and pale skinned with gray eyes and light brown hair. She didn't hide her crush on Lukas and was excited to see that he was still there instead of Walter who she found repulsive as he usually smelled of weed, alcohol and body odor. He always hit on her inappropriately which made her skin crawl. George and Aria reentered the diner with Aria looking gloomy. 

""How's the car?"" Lukas asked turning around. 

""She has a cracked engine block. It's bad. She's gonna need a replacement. I'm gonna have to order it. Might be a couple days... I'm about to tow her car now before the storm rolls in."" George replied wiping his hands on an oily rag before leaving. 

Aria took a seat at the counter and rubbed her hands through her braids. Lukas walked over staring at her sympathetically while Stephanie watched frowning as she put away her purse under the counter. 

""Looks like you'll be stuck here for a couple days...I'm sorry."" He said softly. 

Aria looked up and shrugged. ""I guess it can't be helped...Is there a motel around here?"" She asked. 

""Oh honey, you don't want to stay there. It ain't safe. Especially for someone that looks like you."" Marlene said placing a server pad and pen in her apron and grabbing two glasses of ice water. She walked over to one of the booths with a smile. 

""She's right, unfortunately."" Lukas replied. 

""Well where should I stay?"" Aria asked worriedly. 

Before Lukas could answer more customers entered in noisily. Lukas excused himself as Marlene stuck an order ticket above the grill. Stephanie narrowed her eyes at Aria as she passed by to greet and serve the new customers. The Diner had suddenly become lively. One of the customers started the jukebox, playing Toni Braxton's Un-break My Heart . The smell of grits, bacon, sausage, eggs, hash browns and coffee filled the air. Aria watched as Lukas, Marlene and Stephanie worked as a well oiled machine. Lukas worked quickly, getting out orders fast. He rung a small bell whenever an order was complete and one of the waitresses would come and gather it up, balancing plates on their arms with the skills of well practiced acrobats. Lukas turned around and sat a plate of scrambled eggs, sausage and hash browns in front of Aria. 

""It's on the house, I hope this is okay?"" He said with a smile.

""Oh, thank you so much! Yes, it looks delicious."" Aria replied.

Clouds rolled in as the sky darkened outside. Thunder sounded loudly as a sudden heavy rain started pouring blocking the bright late spring sun that had just been shining brightly. Aria peeked out of the small window next to the soda machine before placing $10 in the tip jar. She started eating closing her eyes occasionally as she did. The food was well seasoned and tasty. She savored the flavor as the creeking of the diner doors sounded off again. She turned around and slowly removed her fork from her mouth. Marlene walked by greeting the new guest but stopped mid sentence. The loud chattering of the customers slowly all came to a halt as people noticed the new visitors that entered. The sudden quietness except the melodic singing of Toni Braxton caused Lukas to turn from the grill and face the door. 

Three tall men had entered. Each looked to be almost 7 ft (213.36 cm) in height. They were pale, pasty. Not the kind of pale that came from albinism as their skin looked powdery and slightly synthetic. Their eyes were dark, not dark brown but deep black. Their faces were long and strangely muscular. Their hair was silky black and slicked down neatly. They had black, thick eyebrows but neither of them had any visible eyelashes. Their lips were thin and pale. They were all identical in appearance, down to their choice of elegant 3 piece, double breasted red and dark gray suits and off black, polished wing tipped shoes. Aria felt instantly uncomfortable as they all smiled in unison, revealing perfectly white, large teeth. Stephanie frowned as she grabbed an empty coffee mug from a table. Marlene cleared her throat and continued her greeting with a shaky voice, telling the three gentleman they could sit wherever. 

The men remained silent but continued smiling as the thunder sounded loudly and lightening streaked across the gray sky. Aria placed her fork on her plate and got up from the stool. She walked around the counter, stopping before going completely behind it as a bad feeling entered her chest. One of the men watched her intently with his dark eyes, his wide smile never leaving his pale face. Suddenly, the men opened their mouths wide in unison as their eyes rolled back into their heads. Stephanie screamed, dropping the coffee mug breaking it. Some customers jumped from their booths with expressions of horror painted across their confused faces. The men jaws dropped low, making popping sounds like breaking bones as long, barbed, pale tongues protruded from their gaping mouths. The man on the right tongue shot out grabbing a customer around his neck, snatching him violently from the booth as his wife screamed desperately, attempting to hold his legs. The barbs cut deep into his flesh but his blood did not spill, instead it ran up the long tongue and into the man's mouth. Within seconds he was pale and limp as the man dropped him and snatched his screaming wife, quickly draining her of her blood and allowing her to join her husband in death. 

The man in the middle seized Marlene, lifting her high into the air. She kicked, struggling to grab the tongue as the barbs pierced into her neck and hands. The man drained her blood within moments. The customers yelled in terror as they desperately scrambled attempting to run from their tables to the back of the diner. Stephanie yelled for Marlene whose body had become limp. The man on the left aimed for Aria, his tongue shooting out so fast she couldn't react quickly enough to move. Lukas grabbed her arm and snatched her forcefully to his side before the tongue could reach her. The man's eyes returned to their proper position as he looked at Lukas and Aria perplexed. The other two had disregard their victims as they snatched others with speed and precision, plucking the screaming people like flowers from the ground as they attempted to escape. The fearful shrieking and chaos grew more intense, overshadowing Toni Braxton's He Wasn't Man Enough that played loudly in the background.

1j0yzm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/1j0yzm1/typeme_based_on_the_questionnaire_provided_by_the/,TypeMe based on the questionnaire provided by the subreddit post!,"I will be answering the provided questions in a quest to get some more closure on finding my type. I have quite a bit of experience with Jungian psychology and MBTI from a variety of perspectives, but I feel that in order to get a clearer picture of what I am dealing with it could be helpful to consult with others on this subject.

I have suspected I am some form of xNFx for a long time, but I tend to flip-flop a lot. As I have never really submitted a description of myself for more in-depth type assistance I figured that getting an outside perspective could be helpful in getting some clarity, if not an outright answer.

**‚Ä¢ How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.**

Ok, so I am a male and 31 years old. I would describe myself as a reasonably intelligent person with a relatively narrow set of interests but borderline obsession with the way in which we do think and can possibly think about given things. This stems from my experience studying not only psychoanalysis/MBTI/Jung but my university studies of philosophy. My primary background is in metaphysics, which I enjoyed immensely.

This manner of thinking gives me an eccentric quality, and I can be quite stuck in my head and maybe sometimes unaware of how I actually come off to the world- there is probably some sort of disjunction there. I love animals, fine dining, and usually conversations with close friends that I think I am somewhat on the same wavelength with.

While I can be quite warm as a person I can also be somewhat unstable in an emotional sense. It does not take too much for me to veer from one extreme to the other emotionally. I also acknowledge the fact that I am quite immature, because it is hard for me to come to grip with my own emotions and I have a tendency to overintellectualize them and lean on my vast quantity of self-knowledge.

**‚Ä¢ Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?**

I have a thyroid condition but it has never really impacted my mental health as far as I know. An overall lability of affect and neuroticism have been constant attendants in my life however. At one point I had a therapist that considered the possibility of Asperger's syndrome but this was never confirmed, and I personally don't find it entirely accurate. I do however have OCD, and what I suspect is ADHD.

**‚Ä¢ Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?**

My mother was a non-practicing Christian, and father non-practicing Muslim who emigrated to the USA from different countries. They have since separated. I always considered myself culturally closer to Christianity as we nevertheless celebrated Christmas at home. I really enjoy the holiday season as I feel like it makes me feel whole in a sense- both in terms of physical comfort but in a kind of universal, holistic way as well.

Overall my upbringing was very driven by my interior thoughts- it still is. I tend to find my thinking dominates my life in a way that is not entirely healthy at times and I need to actively work to bring myself down to earth and see the world in a more unvarnished way, but my buzzy head immediately gets back to thinking and reframing everything.

**‚Ä¢ What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?**

As for what I do, I live and work in a foreign country, the language of which I taught myself and am practically fluent in. My work involves tourism and I love my city, so it's been a really terrific experience. My city has a lot of good food and I am incredibly food driven, so having all of this delicious cuisine to eat and experience has been quite a boon, but perhaps a punishment for my wallet. I am a bit nervous about my future, but I enjoy getting to meet and speak with differing kinds of people and have valuable cultural experiences.

**‚Ä¢ If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**

I think it depends on how I spend it. I would like to keep myself somewhat busy but I sometimes can feel like I want to avoid hanging out with people depending on the activity. I would feel refreshed if I purchased a good bottle of wine and made a nice hearty meat sauce while watching some stuff on youtube. Sometimes however I get bored and need the stimulation so I go out just to get a coffee, enjoy being around people, and finding a sense of solace in those things.

**‚Ä¢ What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?**

I enjoy running. I used to enjoy it more until an injury made excessive strain on nerves in my back somewhat impracticable, but there are times when I really enjoy getting energy out by running. I also do calisthenic exercises at home often to keep my posture somewhat stable. When running I vastly prefer doing it outside as I can visualize changes in scenery as I run. Treadmills are awfully boring in my opinion. I really enjoy walking as well as it allows for me to get into my mind while providing me a way to burn calories without the shock that comes with running.

**‚Ä¢ How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**

I would say I am quite curious and have a voracious appetite for ideas. I would say it's less that I have ideas, but more that I am inexorably 'had' by my ideas. They tend not to be things I can execute, but just a boundless tendency to continuously think or worry about something. My curiosities include:

\- Metaphysics, and potential ways of thinking about given things.

\- Accents, dialects, and regional variation on things from language to food.

\- Biodiversity

\- Psychology and personality types, typology

\- Food and flavor

\- The truth of things- truth as such. Ontology, mereology, just random stuff.

\- Ways of thinking in general, meaning as such.

\- and (probably) much more.

**‚Ä¢ Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**

I think I could lead. I would be diplomatic to a fault and perhaps poor at conflict resolution depending on the situation, or alternatively quite good at getting to a good compromise. I would have a hard time raising my voice or applying pressure if required. I would need to be disciplined with myself as well in order to be sure I am representing the leader position as well. Traditionally, I felt as if I would be quite bad at being a leader and perhaps I would be, but I almost see myself as giving you a different answer to this question depending on the day and my mood haha.

**‚Ä¢ Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?**

I am not coordinated in some ways and tend to take shortcuts in order to minimize dexterous movements. On the other hand, my reaction speed is quite good as I tend to be mentally 'on' a lot. I would get bored with meticulous work quite fast I think though. While I enjoy running I find it is easier to kind of do it on autopilot, which is why I like it.

**‚Ä¢ Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**

I am not an artist but do enjoy art. I tend to like Renaissance artists like Raphael but also dabble occasionally in more modern stuff. I tend not to like postmodern art (not out of some sense of elitism, it just doesn't move me as much). I do like some of the Flemish masters like Van Eyck, some El Greco, and a mix of other things besides. Literature wise I enjoy reading metaphysical treatises (I enjoy Kant's Critique of Pure Reason a fair bit but I find it to be almost overwhelmingly pregnant with meaning).

**‚Ä¢ What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**

The past is something I see from a remove- it is something that I can regard but it is fixed and unmoving. I recognize how it has an influence on my life, but I do not live on behalf of it either. Having said that, I am insecure and sometimes afraid of new things so I might inadvertently try to preserve my security by sticking to the tried and true.

Present is where I am most I would say as of now because dealing with my own thoughts constantly entrenches me there. I live into the future by virtue of being present. Sometimes I tend to think I am in a kind of eternal and timeless thought-bubble.

The future is something nebulous to me as I see it as an extension of the present. Everything runs on a continuum and I don't see the point in fixing present/future as absolute durations. This is different from how I conceive the past, which provides the platform for even conceiving what the present is at all. The past and the way it works on us is in some sense part of what is unknowable to the human, as it is something that enables us to be who we are now.

**‚Ä¢ How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?**

I can be disgruntled if it is something that takes me out of comfort, or if I had plans it infringes upon. I usually say yes though as I like to help my friends. If others ask I will usually do it, but I do say no sometimes. That being said, I enjoy being helpful and supportive to my friends, as I kind of abide by Aristotle's saying: ‚ÄúA friend is a second self, so that our consciousness of a friend's existence...makes us more fully conscious of our own existence.‚Äù

**‚Ä¢ Do you need logical consistency in your life?**

Hmmm, good question. I don't think so though. I think logic is about applying consistency to what is absolutely neutral material- and at one point absolute neutrality is just pure unformed chaos. I think all humans impose some sort of psychological order on life (that's what the types themselves are, that's what makes certain types of philosophy possible) and in that sense, I think I inevitably impose a kind of consistency on life. Whether or not it is logical is another story I suppose.

**‚Ä¢ How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**

I think increasingly important, as it gives me a metric to assess myself by that is more objective and reliable than just going by my thoughts alone, which I am gradually beginning to see the weaknesses of. In the future I want to be able to strike a balance between being efficient/productive and capable of totally disengaging from the desire to be so either.

**‚Ä¢ Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?**

No, I don't think so. However, I do try to protect myself from them by maintaining the illusion of comfort that I have amidst them. I think I am more likely to pull away from others than to impose on them. I like observing people to some extent and controlling them would make them less interesting.

**‚Ä¢ What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**

I like to watch video game related streams as they allow me to zone out and get cozy while vicariously watching somebody do those things.

I like reading at times as they force me to see the world from a different perspective- this I find I learn a lot from.

I like playing video games to pass the time at times.

I like language learning as it allows me to feel like I have a goal (fluency in some language).

I like to eat well, and so I cook to do so. I find cooking to be quite laborious and annoying but enjoy the flavor of food I make, so I do it for this reason.

**‚Ä¢ What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**

Learning wise I need only one thing- to be interested in the thing, and the ability to actively engage with the material. If possible, I like being able to verbalize or discuss things I'm learning in order to objectify my own thought process somewhat. I am good at memorizing things and find it quite easy. I am not a logical person, or particularly good at thinking logically. Most of the time when I understand something I understand it coherently- I am very bad at breaking down concepts. Things tend to inhere as wholes for me and for that reason I enjoy analogies as a means of comprehending things. I tend to be bad at performative assessments of aptitude in subjects.

**‚Ä¢ How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?**

I am pretty bad at this. I wouldn't say I wing projects per se, but I tend to work in bursts of energy/inspiration. I tend to want to have an idea of what I am going to do and plan for addressing it, but I would hardly call it systematic.

**‚Ä¢ What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?**

I wish I had more clarity on this- I would say that the lack of it is something that is holding me back. I have some rather nebulous ideas about being able to combine my love of food and culture with an industry somehow, but this is not exactly fully formed and remains inchoate. I do maybe want to get my PhD in Philosophy one day however.

**‚Ä¢ What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**

I've realized that fear is deceptive. Sometimes the things that we fear the most don't seem to matter at all, because we have blotted them out in order to even avoid an askance view at them. I realized lately that I have what I *think* is a fear of intimacy. I have had fears about my sexuality and issues relating to sexuality, my intelligence (which is deeply linked to my sense of self esteem), intimacy more generally, and not being in control of who I am. Some of my dislikes I know are irrational- for example disliking it when people have fun doing things I consider 'wrong' in some way, like clubbing/partying. I know logically that this is not something worth fretting over but it does bother me at times.

On a more superficial level I don't like swimming near jellyfish, wasps/hornets, heights.

As for things I hate/dislike, I generally really tend to dislike it when people are ungrateful towards the efforts or kindness of others.

**‚Ä¢ What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?**

When I am able to prove to myself in some way that I am intelligent/competent. When I overcome a fear of mine/achieve some sort of personal growth. When I meet somebody and eventually have a really productive and insightful conversation with them.

**‚Ä¢ What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?**

When I realize that I have been complacent and avoiding an issue, and when I persist in not addressing it with action. When I feel like I have let others down.

**‚Ä¢ How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?**

This is a difficult one for me to answer, as I feel like the line between reality/my mind is a bit blurred at times. While I DEFINITELY do daydream I would say I more often tend to get 'lost in thought'. They can be about anything, from vapid tumbleweed chases in the cranium to more sustained thinking on a philosophical problem or idea.

**‚Ä¢ Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?**

My OCD obsession for sure. Why I am in the room. Thinking about the fact that I am in the room and that I am thinking about why I am in it, and how this entire nexus/chain of thoughts itself is part of my way of thinking. I would be neurotically thinking a lot for sure- probably that I need to do something and it would be hard to sit still. But part of me would be able to see the humor in the overall situation.

**‚Ä¢ How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**

A long time. I also tend to think that I don't actively make the decision at times, but rather that it ends up making itself within me before bubbling up to the surface. That being said, some of the most important decisions I did make (moving abroad to live/work) have had immense impact on my life and I realize that in order to make changes you need to be the first mover in most cases. We create our own momentum by first getting the ball rolling, and then to this ball our luck, karma, and identity effect what accrues to this moving ball.

**‚Ä¢ How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**

Emotions are extremely important to me- I am at their mercy often and am a very ""limbic"" and emotionally labile person. That being said, there are some major emotional cores inside me that I feel like I am in the dark on, and they change at a very glacial pace beneath my more jagged day-to-day emotional experience. For that reason while I think I understand myself quite well, and I accept that I am highly emotional, my emotions can be things that are hard for me to process or come to terms with. I find that in some ways I have an avoidant personality style, and tend to try to shield myself from unpleasant emotions. However, I do think I also have an inner sense of self-responsibility that impels me to deal with them in some way, no matter how long or how slowly or how difficult it is for me.

As an aside, this is why therapy for me has been challenging. It's hard for me to allow myself to be emotionally vulnerable, and I over-intellectualize my sessions. I can be quite dismissive of therapists at times when I don't think they are qualified to do what they do or charge the amount of money they charge.

**‚Ä¢ Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?**

Very, very, very often. I detest conflict and agree with others to avoid disputes at times. Even if internally I feel annoyed and/or angry, I feel like I lose my ability to reason or process emotions when challenged in debates or criticized, and this can cause me to become very agitated. I would say this has been a big theme in my life.

**‚Ä¢ Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?**

Very rarely. I just don't see the need or have the desire to. Logically however I sometimes understand that doing so can make sense, it is just never something that occurred to me to do or want to do.

I was a wild kid, I'll admit that. Liked twice I went out and forgot to tell my parents, I stole once and was talking with people about NSFW on discord(I was a dumb kid). But I don't think any of those things are deserving of the treatment I'm getting. Here's a brief list of the stuff my mom did:
- went on a monologue about how I don't have friends because of my acne (I was bullied and she knows it) 
- got my grandma to ask if she has to comment that my pfp is super ugly to get me to take it down (my mom insisted I put myself on my FB pfp instead of the snake I had there. The pfp was a picture of me with one of those smiley stickers filters since I started liking my face again) 
- threatened my on a weekly basis that she'll take me out of dormitory because of bad grades (I was passing in all classes that year the only bad grade was math which was a 4. This year the threats stopped because she stopped caring as long as I pass) 
- is the reason for my body dismorpia as whenever something fit snug or was a bit small (like when her coworker sent me a dress she didn't want) she'd say I need a diet and I started skipping meals just to eat like those rice discs because she said I won't gain weight from them
- when I tried to tell her I'm mentally drained she'd tell me to wait till high school or that she's in college (that was years ago, I didn't try since) 
- and of course the classic mom ""don't yell at me"" or ""don't be rude"" when I'm just telling her something normal like that I'm already doing what she told me to
- a few weeks ago she walked into the bathroom while I was taking a bath. She kept petting my head even when I asked her to leave because I was vulnerable and I didn't want her there. It took 6 tries before she got up, grabbed my phone and left giggling. When I told her what she did she didn't admit fault and found it super funny that I told her it made me uncomfortable

So now to the thing that actually happened yesterday. She insisted that we go to another part of town to get my cat that ran away, and I told her multiple times that I don't think it's a good idea. Breaking habit is a big deal for me and I always take 2 hours to get ready to see my cousin for coffee every other week. She insisted that we can be back and so we went. We didn't end up going there but to the store and to carry something to her friend. We did not make it back in time especially when she confessed she'd be slow because her back hurts. I told her 5:45, we got back at 6:00 and I couldn't get everything done in 45min and be out the door(cut my bangs cause they got too long, wash my hair, do my make up, straighten my hair and get dressed). I was in stress to the point I cried and she refused to admit that it was a bad idea to go and that she ignored me and instead gave me a pill to calm down. I ended up cancelling because my cousin wasn't in town anyways. But here's the more bothersome thing. My mom is the kind of person that will smack my ass just because she finds it funny ig? She knows I got SAd by a neighbor and still did it until one day she asked if I don't want her to do it because of that(I've told her countless times before) and she promised not to. Surprise surprise, she did it again, and got offended when I told her not to. Got all puffy like ""leave me alone"" and closed herself in the living room. That night we talked and she agreed that she won't do it and that if I don't wanna be touched she won't force me to. I didn't refuse a lot simply because she usually used me as a teddy bear to cry to, and asked me to hide her drinking from dad (she did actually limit it after a while),so I felt bad and didn't wanna leave her alone in it. Yesterday you can guess what happened. She told me she wanted to cuddle, which I agreed, I wasn't hyped about it but I ""knew"" that if I really REALLY didn't want to I can say no. We cuddled, then a few minutes later she wanted again and I said no. She asked why, I told her we talked about it, then she said she won't be here forever. I tried to tell dad that she keeps ignoring it and he just agreed with her. I don't know what to do anymore I thought my dad would have my back but he doesn't give a fuck and I don't know if I can handle it. She told me she has schizophrenia but also when I told her (WHEN SHE ASKED ME TO TELL HER IF I'M STRUGGLING BTW) that I think I might have autism she just laughed and said that I'm just a  weirdo like her which makes me believe she didn't ever go to a professional. I don't see her 5 times in a week when I'm in school but even those 2 days are enough and I don't want to be here anymore the only person in my family who supports me 100% in this is my aunt and she's a minor too so she can't get me away. I can move out in 2 years when I'm 18 but idk if I can handle it until then. Whether to argue with my mom because I said no or to bite through it and suffer. ",2,1740834142.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

Your task is to write up an Ace Attorney case where a noun I supply below is an important part of the case. After the deadline passes (see below), submissions will no longer be taken and the community will vote for submissions in a Google Form. 

Prizes are as follows:

**1st Place: buy you a pizza** *($15)*

**2nd Place: buy you a burger** *($10)*

**3rd Place: buy you a coffee** *($5)*

**In the comments, I will make a post that will give a template of what your submission should look like.** If possible, please fill in all the sections in the template, including N/A if needed. **Feel free to reply to that comment in regards to questions or general discussion. The rest of the thread is for submissions only.**

Regarding the description area, feel free to be descriptive as possible! If you fear the post is too long, you may post the description over several comments or through another source such as Google Docs. There is no word limit, so please do not worry about such.

And remember, **don‚Äôt hold back your creativity!** Your case can be a standard AA case, it can be a reminiscence case, or an Investigations-style case! *(Given the new release, I'd encourage trying an Investigations-style case, though obviously this isn't a requirement.)* 

However, there are some limitations. First, **dark topics are allowed, but discuss them with me beforehand.** That goes for abuse, gore... basically, anything that might require a content warning besides your standard Ace Attorney crime. **Do not be dark just for the sake of being dark or edgy** -- if you are going to include such a topic, have a reason for including it. If you do include such a topic, **please include a content warning at the start of your case.**

Also, **joke posts are allowed, but only ones that are well-thought out, clever, and/or high-quality.** Anything like ‚ÄúThE PHoEnIX wiRIGHT TUnraBOOT: sOMEONE DIED aND phEENIX HAd TO dFEENdED THem!!!1!"" is not allowed.

If you're concerned about crossing one of these lines, message me and I'll work with you to make sure your case abides by the guidelines. Other than those limitations; don‚Äôt hold your creativity back!

The noun for this contest... is not a noun at all. Instead, your case must include the following character and character profile:

> **Asa Turney** (28): The self-proclaimed ""Lord of Lawyers"" whose boisterous proclamations overshadow any real or presumed legal skills that may be possessed. Has a particular hatred of defendants.

The deadline for this contest is **Saturday, April 5 at 11:59 PM EDT**. This gives entrants five weeks to plan and write their cases.

I‚Äôve been so anxious and depressed. This has got to be the lowest point of my life because I truly cared about my job and gave it everything. I have never received any negative feedback. I have not been given any clear actionable tasks but instead just bullshit LPs to meet, and according to my manager, I‚Äôm not meeting any of them. This is so abrupt and obvious. He was totally normal prior to the January performance reviews, then now he‚Äôs just finding ways daily to break me down. He‚Äôs attending all my meetings and watching every move. The fact that he is telling me he is doing this is making me so anxious about even the most minor task because I keep questioning my ability to do it right and I‚Äôm losing sleep. My stocks are investing in April and he has given me 4-6 weeks so that puts me at end of March. I am putting in 10+ hour days. I have completely put my family on the back burner because I really need my RSU. Every time I return to Reddit, I am reminded that this is not going to turn out well for me, but I just don‚Äôt know how to not try to beat focus. I have never been a slacker and I feel like I am being targeted for recently giving birth. I delivered on a very high impact project this week and my manager did not even acknowledge it. Instead, he found something else to criticize, including mentioning a time that I asked for his help with a task while we were casually getting coffee one year ago. I feel like I‚Äôm on an island and he is reaching out to everyone I work with to gather anything negative that he can. I can feel their shift and attitude towards me. This has never happened before. His follow up emails to our meetings just document falsely what was discussed. I don‚Äôt even have the ability to question the lies since I am trying to maintain a positive relationship in the hopes that he will take me out of focus so I can get my stocks. I am writing to see if anyone else has experienced this after maternity and what did you do? I have exhausted my FMLA leave so now it seems like I have no choice but to give up my RSU.

You deserve this Queen. ‚ù§Ô∏è 

Sorry for the long post. I (47F) have been working as a Van driver for the BNSF/UP Railroads for almost 3 years. Now, for a little background, I have had three anxiety attacks my whole life. Two of these will be important later. My coworker (36 M) has been there just a little longer than I have and when we first met I liked him very much. He always seemed to make me laugh, and the fact that he was one of our union reps, I always felt comfortable bringing up any issues I may have had. Him and I would talk outside of work, strictly as friends (I'm so not his type and I'm very happily married to my gorgeous husband) Now, he also has a very calming voice. Now, here is where one ofy anxiety attacks comes in. There was an incident where for no reason at all (as some of you with anxiety may understand, they just happen to pop up at any given time.Thanks a lot anxiety! üòÇ.) I had been driving in a certain area of the yard and all of the sudden my heart began to race and I began breathing very deeply, unable to genuinely catchy breath. I had parked my Van near one of the restrooms and got out of my Van. My body began to shake so I bent over to try and place my head between my knees, then would stand up straight and raise my arms to try and open my airways. I got scared. I texted my coworker explaining the situation and he called me immediately. He had begun talking very slowly in an extremely calming matter trying to calm me down and as I told him what was going on I was completely stuttering my words. I could not get out a full sentence. I sounded like I had a speech impediment and a lisp. And, every time I would stutter I would lose my breath. He stayed with me on the phone until I eventually calmed down. I had asked him ""Holy Shit, how did you do that? He chuckled at me. I thanked him from the bottom of my heart and thanked him. He said ""No worries girl, I got you."" I I was very grateful for him and proceeded back to work. 

Now, the first incident between us occurred when him and I were sitting in my Van just chit chatting, and we were discussing, well girls, he's single and has a certain taste in women. The subject then went on to dolls, please don't ask me why or how LOL. He had explained to me that he's always had a phobia of Bratz dolls. At first I chuckled at him saying ""Nooo, are you serious?""  but then remembered my own phobia about clowns. There had been several times very close friends of mine would send me pictures of clowns or post clowns on my Facebook with funny sayings, for example, a room full of clowns saying ""What would you do if you woke up and saw us all here?, or a very scary clown with a caption reading ""I'm under your bed"" (mostly from my best friend, he's also male and quite the comedian. üòíBut, I love him.) some of these are also from other friends that don't mean any harm and mean it as a joke. I always take these as jokes. I know my friends very well and they're always razzing me about clowns, I honestly don't mind it's all in good fun. So one day I had sent him a screenshot of a Bratz doll on Facebook tagging him, and wrote something on the caption, please forgive me I don't remember what the caption read, but he soon texted me afterwards in all caps screaming at me. He had said that it wasn't funny and how dare I do this to him. I had profusely apologize to him in this text message and told him that it was all in good fun but if I overstep my boundaries I apologize and that I didn't mean any harm. (The post was immediately deleted.) He then proceeded to berate me and cuss me out and told me I was F'd up and cruel and he could no longer be friends with me. In that instance I responded by telling him ""Wow, over this? Well, you just F'd up and, if that's the way you want it okay."" 

Him and I hadn't spoken for a couple months after that. At one time, I was in the back getting ready to have my lunch and another one of our van drivers had pulled up and started talking to me when all of the sudden, I felt those exact symptoms of an oncoming anxiety attack. This night I knew that my coworker was there doing a road job. Oh by the way I'm a yard driver. My friend began getting very scared and every time I would try to drink water it wouldn't go down so I would just spit it back out. I started stuttering yet again and asked for him to please go get this other coworker. Before I knew it this coworker hey driven around the back, I was seated on the back bumper of my Van, and he immediately walked right up to me got down in a crouching position put his arm on my shoulder and began talking to me extremely smoothly. Within a matter of minutes the anxiety attack was gone. In the midst of this anxiety attack I had apologized to him saying that I was very sorry about sending him the picture and that I had meant absolutely no harm. He just shushed me and said ""No no that was my fault I should not have overreacted you did nothing wrong."" After that night him and I became friends again. 

Now, here's where I may be the A-hole. About a month ago I was driving my shift in the yard and was on my lunch break but ended up being about 15 minutes late getting back (guess where I was! Lol) and I had texted him, because he was, again, in the yard that night and was telling him how upset my stomach was and that I was going to be about 15 minutes late, and basically telling him how much this sucked. ( Now, I didn't go into exact detail, but I did inform him of where I was.) My sight supervisor had also been there that night. When I got back to the lineup I went inside to speak to my site supervisor to explain to her that I was very very sorry for being late, oh yes, and I also messaged her while I was where I was. My site supervisor is extremely understanding and kind of chuckled and told me that everything was fine and i was okay. However, my coworker had also been in the office just talking to our site supervisor, basically shooting the breeze, and when I looked over at him and chuckled he looked up at me with disdain in his eyes and had been extremely rude about how openly I was about it, telling me that he didn't need to know these details saying he didn't know why the (frick) I needed to tell him sht like this (again, I didn't go into extreme details) all while giving me dirty looks as if I were gross and, his tone of voice was not okay. 

There had been other times where him and I would talk and he had never talked to me telling me that what I was telling him was unfit or rude and had always laughed with me about certain things. I was quite taken aback by his coldness and the fact that he was rudely looking at me. I looked around as if thinking WTF? And left it where it was and went back to my vehicle. I later got a message from my sight supervisor telling me not to worry about him and he had been in a bad mood. Now, one thing I should probably tell you about myself is that I'm a Pisces. We are extremely emotional (oftentimes too emotional for certain situations I do admit that), but I'm also an extremely loving, loyal, and faithful friend. I will go to Great lengths for friends of mine especially when they are in need and will never ask for anything in return. (Why would you ask for anything when you truly love and care for them?) If you were to ask my family, every single one of them would tell you that my strongest attribute is loyalty. I've been this way my entire life.

Later that day I was on my way to pick up my son it was around 4:00 in the afternoon and I had been stewing on this for most of the day. I was still very hurt by his words and his dirty looks and complete rudeness towards me. I had messaged him and told him how I felt and told him that, even though I am an extremely loyal friend, I do not give third chances. Him and I had had beef in the past and all was forgiven, but this was not okay. He had messaged me telling me that he wanted to call me to apologize to me for his actions and words. But I had messaged him back and told him that he had had all day to apologize even through a text message let alone a phone call but decided not to. Now, on one hand, had he apologize to me by the end of my shift (I work graveyard 8pm-4am, or even within the first couple hours I more than likely would have totally forgiven him (everyone has a bad day) but again he chose not to. By this time it had been well over 12 hours and I had not heard from him at all. I had told him that he was now considered just a coworker, but that we were no longer friends. I told him I do not give third chances and that he had had all day to apologize to me for his actions but chose not to do so. I told him if we are working together, and since he is one of our Union reps, that I would be extremely cordial and polite to him, (I would never in a million years purposely start drama no matter where I am, especially at work) but, we are in fact just coworkers. I do not want to shoot the breeze with him and I do not want to talk to him about other things that do not pertain to work. He has avoided me the few times he has seen me since this incident and I am perfectly okay with it. 

Now I know this in itself is an A-hole way of thinking, but like I had stated previously I am extremely loving, faithful, and loyal to all my friends and, I will do everything that I can to be there for you. I'm good at comforting and I have great ears for listening to you vent if you need to. I will even take you for a drive just to scream or even go get a bunch of coffee mugs from the dollar store, take you out somewhere and hand you one mug at a time so you can throw them and smash them against a wall or on the ground, then take you to lunch. When you're pissed off about something , smashing something really helps to get those nasty frustrations out) but I am also the type of person who can not be friends with somebody and not think twice about it (I can easily Not give two Shts just as easily as I can love) In other words I don't care. My extremes can go from one end to the other. I do wish that he would have apologized, but I'm not about to be disrespected by this coworker for a second time. One time is forgivable, two times, it is not going to happen.

1j0ytqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTrade/comments/1j0ytqq/h_lots_of_games_w_trade_for_games_or_paypal_eu/,[H] Lots of Games [W] Trade for Games or Paypal (EU),"**Last Updated List: 01/03/2025**

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of ‚Ç¨1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

* **[IGS Rep Page](https://reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/zvionr/xiaoliis_igs_rep_page/)**

* **[SteamRep](https://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198074920693)**

&nbsp;

I kindly ask of you is to be reasonable when making offers to make it a fair trade for both of us.

Let's have a good exchange/trade!

I lost my job.

I had $2000 left to my name, and in 7 days I paid $1900 in my moms hospital bills, rent and 5 years worth of late shopify fees trying to get back into dropshipping at some point.

15 year olds flipping pencils on tiktok earning millions spending it all on weed and shoes, meanwhile I'm 23 with the same torn clothes i had at 17, 0 life watching my mom die and I'm out of shape spending my entire life lifting boxes and scraping pennies eating ramen. 

If you're younger, living with your parents, have healthy parents, have a job, aren't banned from anywhere and have at least $2 in your name I don't want to hear dog fucking shit from you. And If i manage to get out of this cesspit of hell by the end of this year I want to hear even less, I'd actually be pissed off imagining it.

And before I get ""yet you're typing on Reddit"" well there's fuck else to talk too except my wall. Thousands of Gen Zs crying on tiktok that starbucks raised their coffee by 15 cents.

1j0yp38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wholesomenosleep/comments/1j0yp38/one_of_the_goats_from_our_rescue_farm_went/,One of the goats from our rescue farm went missing. I still can't explain what I found when we went looking for him. (Part 1),"The first time I saw a goat eat, it scared the bejesus out of me.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love them‚Äîbut they are just absolute machines. They devour everything in sight. I get that it‚Äôs an evolutionary imperative for all living things, hardwired into us. But even so, I‚Äôm convinced some things just have a different kind of hunger.

I never imagined I'd wind up with opinions about how goats eat. I certainly never thought I would be living in the South, let alone the deep South, and certainly not the sweaty belly button strip of Alabama above the Florida panhandle. But Cory grew up here and got an itch around the time he was ‚Äúlet go‚Äù from his third job that he wanted to move back.

Before I met my ex-husband, I had barely even crossed the bridges out of New York City, and if I did, it was just to go shopping at the outlets or brunch in Jersey, the occasional weekend to the shore. Certainly never past the Mason-Dixon line. But Cory, with his farm-baked, sun-bleached hair and a drawl that could stretch a single syllable into eternity, had a way of making the implausible sound heavenly. We settled, if you could call it that, in Cory‚Äôs sleepy hometown on the Alabama River, where the most excitement came from Friday night high school football games and the biggest pigs and pies at the county fair.

Adjusting wasn‚Äôt easy, to say the least. I missed the anonymity of the city, the buzzing background noise of living stacked among strangers, the cocoon of privacy of no-eye-contact subway rides and silent elevators. Cory thrived, though. He slipped back into Southern life like it was an old pair of jeans‚Äî comfortable and familiar. The same way he slipped back into the relationship with his high school sweetheart, Leanne, who he‚Äôs still with, although they moved after she had the baby.

While our relationship obviously didn‚Äôt last, I have to admit that I also developed a kind of admiration for the rusted backwoodsy charm of the nooks and crannies of Alabama. So did our son, Brett, who took to it as naturally as his father did‚Äì a huge part of my decision to stay.

When Cory and I separated, I got the big old fixer-upper of a house, along with the land it sat on. It‚Äôs a five-acre sprawl‚Äî an expanse that, in my previous life, would have been unimaginable. I didn‚Äôt know what to do with it, but Brett did, filling it up with every bizarre outdoor project you could imagine a young boy might get up to in acres of fallow farmland. And then, in the blink of an eye, he was grown, and he was out and about with friends, not chasing fireflies and making mud potions in cracked plastic buckets. Brett left for college last fall (Roll Tide! is the new daily hymnal every time he comes home on break). Living alone, the place felt empty. Too quiet.

So, in came the goats.

Why goats, you might ask? Instead of traveling the world, escaping back to my old stomping ground in New York?

The answer would take the rest of my lifetime to sort through. It‚Äôs knotted up with the kind of existential thread that starts to unravel when you find yourself standing in the middle of your life wondering how you got there. Scraping the edge of forty years old, in a place that just barely felt like it accepted you, even after so much time. Half of my life gone, lightening fast, truly alone for the first time in twenty years.

I needed something‚Äî some living, breathing chaos to manage, like I was used to. The goats were a chance to repair something that needed me as much as I needed them. A project, a purpose, a distraction. Around here, they have this saying: ‚ÄúLife comes at you fast, and you gotta keep up‚Äù. Hokey, I know. But I appreciate the sentiment anyway.

And there was the kudzu in the yard.

Kudzu, another thing I never thought I would learn so much about, is ‚Äúthe vine that eats the South‚Äù. When I first moved here, I thought it was kind of mystical, this ethereal green shroud that drapes over everything from old barns to telephone poles, making them look like something out of a fairy tale. Little did I know, and much did I learn.

Back in the Great Depression, the South was facing a real problem with erosion. Decades of unsustainable farming had left the land bare and the soil depleted. The government did some research, and saw huge potential in kudzu to fix that. Kudzu was a vine native to Japan, and it grew fast in a short amount of time, which made it ideal for holding soil in place and preventing further loss. So they shipped it over and started planting it‚Äì by the thousands of acres.

And it worked, for a while. By the 1940s, it was being promoted as a cure-all for agricultural woes‚Äì you could cook with it, it was pretty, the list goes on. There were even government incentives for planting it. Farmers got paid to plant kudzu on their lands, and the smaller ones literally couldn‚Äôt afford to say no. So they kept planting‚Äì until millions of acres were swallowed up.

Kudzu climbed over trees, shrubs, fences, swallowed small buildings, covered road signs, took over the roads themselves. A solution turned nightmare. The same characteristics that made kudzu useful made it a seemingly unbeatable adversary. By the 1990s, the government had declared it a noxious weed and began an agricultural war against it. An ongoing one without an end in the foreseeable future, as they so often are. They‚Äôve studied it extensively, and even now, a hundred years later, with all of the advances in science‚Äì they can‚Äôt figure out how to stop it.

It‚Äôs nearly impossible to kill because its roots go so deep, up to 12 feet, and every piece of root can sprout a new plant if left in the soil. It thrives in hot, humid climates, which there are so many of nowadays, and it barely needs any nutrients at all‚Äî just sunlight, which it‚Äôs very good at finding, even through a thick canopy.

They nicknamed it ""mile-a-minute"" because it grows so quickly, fast, and unstoppable, taking up every inch of space it can touch. You blink, and it‚Äôs over the fence; through the field, up the trees, smothering everything. There‚Äôs even local lore that you need to shut the windows in children‚Äôs rooms at night, because the kudzu can grow so fast it would strangle them in their sleep.

So living in the South, you learn to coexist with the kudzu. You have to. It‚Äôs made itself a permanent part of the landscape. But it‚Äôs a delicate balance. Because if you‚Äôre not careful, it‚Äôll take anything too slow to get out of its way.

Our property was one of those older farms that planted it back in the early 20th century, so kudzu was everywhere, circling it like wildfire. Before we split, Cory used to beat it back into submission. Pretty much the only thing he would do regularly, since he never did figure out how to hold down a job. After he left, the kudzu seemed to sense the vacancy, and it took advantage, encroaching further into our yard, an ever-advancing battalion of green. Brett had fun hacking it back when he was younger‚Äì we would make a weekend out of it, as needed‚Äì but as time went on, it lost its novelty and got more than a little overwhelming.

Another fun fact about kudzu‚Äìgoats can‚Äôt get enough of it. It‚Äôs a high-protein leafy green, a bit like spinach. And, like I said, I was itching for a hobby.

One Saturday morning, I was at a local farmer's market, theoretically shopping, but mostly wandering among stalls to kill time. I stumbled upon a small booth with pictures of goats plastered all around the stall. They were for adoption, the woman at the booth explained. Her name was Marjorie, and she sported a thick pair of glasses, graying hair pulled back in a frizzled bun. She was the first person I ever met to talk to me like I was really a local. Marjorie harbored a fierce hatred for her neighbor, the owner of a commercial goat farm. She was convinced it was run improperly‚Äî a conviction she passed on to me by the end of our hours-long conversation.

The more she talked, the more the gears in my head started turning. Goats loved kudzu, and our backyard was drowning in the stuff. It was almost too perfect. I left with no groceries, her business card, and a simmering idea.

I‚Äôm lucky, in that I‚Äôve pretty much always worked remotely‚Äì the same graphic design firm that hired me out of college. Twenty years at the same job, you earn a certain amount of flexibility to balance out the tediousness of it. Over the next few weeks, in between projects, I did my research. I learned about the dietary habits of goats, their environmental benefits, their overall needs. I read up on enclosures, veterinary care, and what it would take to maintain a small herd.

With a mix of impulse and what I convinced myself was thorough planning, I contacted Marjorie.

‚ÄúStart small,‚Äù she advised. ‚ÄúSee how you manage with a few, then go from there.‚Äù

And like the good novice I was, I listened. I started with three goats: Edgar, Poe, and Virginia, aka 'the three stooges'. And then, because there was an emergency after some local flooding, I got Allen. And then Raven, because her previous owners couldn‚Äôt afford her medical bills. And so on.

If you‚Äôd told me a few years ago that I'd be herding goats instead of designing brochures, I'd have laughed until I cried. I was always a city girl at heart. The first weeks were a crash course in what not to do. Goats, as it turns out, have personalities. Big ones. Toddlers with hooves; curious, rebellious, and capable of wreaking havoc in ways you can barely imagine until you see one eat through a drywall. Or discover your favorite tree, now a stripped, sad-looking stick in the ground. Marjorie‚Äôs warnings about not taking goat ownership lightly echoed in my head like a commercial jingle. It was around the time I found Raven on the roof of my car, chewing thoughtfully on the wiper blades, that I started questioning my life choices. Insane? Probably. But caring for them felt meaningful in a way that once I had it, I could never give up.

The goatscaping business, such as it was in those early days, formed almost accidentally. I‚Äôd been sharing stories of my adventures online, half as a way to keep my distant friends updated, and half as a plea for sympathy. I posted pictures, videos, goats in action‚Äîa real-life stream of before and after shots that showcased their voracious appetites.

But then something unexpected happened. People were interested. Not just ‚Äúamused-by-the-spectacle‚Äù interested, but genuinely interested in hiring my goats for their own overgrowth problems. I needed a way to manage the inquiries, to turn my burgeoning goat obsession into something resembling a sustainable practice. The logo design came surprisingly easy: a cartoonish goat, its eyes wide, munching on a leafy vine that spelled out ‚ÄòGEM‚Äô, the 'E' in 'GEM' doubling as an emerald. Cheeky, slightly unhinged, very much in the spirit of my goats. I texted it to Marjorie, who about died laughing. GEM‚ÄîGoats Eating Mile-a-Minute‚Äîwas born.

Once the logo was plastered on every piece of old farm equipment I owned, I took to social media with a lifetime spent in the advertising orbit. *‚ÄúGot weeds? Rent a GEM.‚Äù ‚ÄúNothing's Faster Than Goats Eating Mile-a-Minute‚Äù* Cheesy? You bet. But this was the land of fried everything and y‚Äôall-speak; cheesy worked. Orders trickled in, then flooded‚Äì local farmers, city planners, the new wave of eco-conscious hipster farmers.

So GEM got bigger. Marjorie was the first person I approached. Then word spread, so we sketched out a cooperative model, a network of local goat rescuers who could pool resources and share the workload. We aren‚Äôt as big as some of the other goatscaping companies out there, but we fill a niche for the smaller local farms and businesses, and we‚Äôre a nonprofit, so we put the proceeds into local rescues and rehabs.

I wouldn‚Äôt call it easy, but most days, I would call it fun. I had finally found a community after all these years of feeling like a transplant being rejected by its host.

Until I got the call from Marjorie that Blue Phillip was missing.

‚ÄúThe big asshole‚Äôs not back with the big asshole yet,‚Äù were her exact words. I knew immediately who she meant. One asshole was a new volunteer‚ÄìHarris Rainier. He was Jacob‚Äôs cousin, who was one of our oldest members, and he had vouched for him. Harris was already notorious. A blandly, blondely handsome man who talked just a little too sweetly to buy into. Very tall- well over six feet. He dressed in faded jeans and a series of nondescript sweatshirts, which he wore with the hood pulled up more often than not. Some folks said he was into drugs, others that he had a ‚Äòhistory,‚Äô and then punctuated it with a pointed look that had your mind wandering. Reminded me a lot of Cory. Hence the ‚Äòbig asshole‚Äô.

As for the other, if you didn‚Äôt already know, goat bucks can get to be over three hundred pounds. Blue Phillip was one of those goats. His name was Goliath when he first got to Marjorie‚Äôs rescue, but he got a name change because he looked like that goat from The VVitch, according to Brett. I‚Äôm not much of a horror person, but Brett is, and he pulled up pictures on his phone for me‚Äìdefinitely a resemblance, aside from Blue Phillip‚Äôs blue-gray hair. Known among the volunteers as a monster with a temper to match, BP wasn‚Äôt the easiest animal to manage. Some of the newbies thought they were goat whisperers, and loved to try their luck. They were supposed to go out with a more senior member, but it didn‚Äôt take a wild guess to say that didn‚Äôt happen.

‚ÄúWhen were they supposed to be back?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúFour hours ago.‚Äù Marjorie‚Äôs voice crackled with impatience.

It wasn‚Äôt that unusual to have a job run long. Goats are anarchists. They don‚Äôt follow any kind of structured thinking. They eat, they climb, they escape, and they do it all with a kind of gleeful chaos. It‚Äôs an endless cycle of breakout and capture, a series of escalating escapades that would‚Äôve been hilarious if they weren‚Äôt so exhausting. But the more I thought about it, the less I trusted the coincidence.

‚ÄúYou check with the client?‚Äù I asked, feeling frustratingly helpless. Marjorie sighed as if she felt the same way.

‚ÄúYup. He split halfway through the job, left the rest of the herd there. I had to go pick them up.‚Äù She said, her voice full of a grumbling heat.

I winced. Rationally, I knew this wasn‚Äôt my fault. But I couldn‚Äôt help but feel like I had let her down. Like I had failed her, failed GEM, by not keeping better tabs.

‚ÄúAnd there‚Äôs been no word from him?‚Äù I asked, already knowing the answer. My fingers paused over the weathered surface of my desk, cluttered with paperwork that suddenly seemed trivial.

‚ÄúNone,‚Äù Marjorie confirmed, her tone dipping into deeper worry. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been calling around, checking every spot they might have gone. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôve gone and vanished into thin air.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho was supposed to go out with him?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúHow ‚Äòbout you take a guess.‚Äù She emphasized her drawl to drive home the sarcasm, letting the vowels linger.

I pinched the bridge of my nose, feeling a worried headache beginning to bloom.

‚ÄúAlright. I‚Äôm on it.‚Äù I said, keeping my voice confident and professional. But when I hung up with Marjorie, the dark screen of my phone reflected a face furrowed with worry.

The next call I made was to Jacob. The line rang briefly before he picked up, his voice immediately tinged with concern when he heard the urgency in mine.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù He asked right away. I explained to him, as calmly as I could. There was a pause, a breath held, and then exhaled on the other side of the line, filled with all the anticipated dread of a relative who knew his kin all too well.

‚ÄúShit,‚Äù Jacob said, the word containing multitudes. ‚ÄúAlright, don‚Äôt do anything yet. Please. I‚Äôll handle it.‚Äù

I‚Äôll give him credit that he genuinely tried to. A group of eight GEM volunteers got together and combed through the community. We started with the hidden clearings and the shady groves where Blue Phillip liked to escape, and then the ones that Jacob knew Harris liked to haunt‚Äì local bars, a strip club, the liminal spaces behind them. With each passing hour, hope dwindled, replaced by the gnawing reality that we were just going through the motions, delaying the inevitable admission of a deeper problem. Towards the end of the night, Jacob and I were both at the police station, heavy-eyed and heavy-hearted as we filled out paperwork under the fluorescent lights.

A week went by, and then another. We kept the search going, putting out feelers to other rescues and farms, some blasts on social media. But after a few months, we had to just admit that at best, Harris had skipped town with Blue Phillip, and at worst‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt like to think about what the worst was. A big part of the reason GEM existed was that people did all kinds of fucked up things with goats out here.

I tried to be considerate when I saw Jacob, who had bowed out of GEM, but still came to our events every once in awhile. We had given the Rainier family a small donation to help with their search, however much I had to twist Marjorie‚Äôs arm.

‚ÄúI hope he got kicked in the head, personally. Would serve him right.‚Äù The older woman had said. Quietly, I echoed her sentiment.

Life went on, though. Marjorie and I were more careful about who we let volunteer, doubling down on formalizing our operations. We put together an online form to streamline the consultations, a first point of contact between us and our potential clients. It captured essential information‚Äì details about the property size, location, type of vegetation present, any specific concerns the property owner might have, like areas where goats shouldn‚Äôt go or particular infestations of invasive species like kudzu. This way we could estimate the number of goats we needed, the duration of the grazing, stuff like that. And with that automation, we had a concrete log of who was going where, and with what goats. No more trust-based system.

I did as many of the jobs as I could on my own. It was overkill, as most of our volunteers were great, but I still felt that gunky residue of guilt clinging to my skin. A year back, I had almost taken Blue Phillip for my own backyard herd, especially when Brett had taken a special interest in him. But I had convinced myself it would be too much, that I was becoming a ‚Äòcrazy goat lady‚Äô, like I had once overheard Cory call me on the phone with Brett. It was silly, I knew, but I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if things would have been different if I had just gone with my gut.

So that morning started off as business as usual, up at dawn, my usual routine before a goatscaping job: chugging back coffee, scarfing down a corn muffin, reminding myself that I had quit smoking four years ago when I caught Brett sneaking one of my cigarettes behind the shed, no matter how much I craved it. The address the client had given was rural‚Äî really rural, right in the middle of the woods, so I packed up an old paper map alongside my other supplies. The client had offered to set up their own fencing, which was usually fine and a real time-saver, but I would still need to bring a backup just in case.

I loaded up the goats into the truck‚Äîmy old, dusty blue Toyota, with the bright GEM logo looking hilariously new on the chipped paint. According to the intake form, this was a small place with the usual kudzu issues, so most of the herd stayed behind, just my original three stooges.

The place was so far out in the boonies that I lost WiFi with more than a quarter of the trip left, the signal flickering in and out like a dying candle. The roads narrowed and the houses thinned until it was just me, the goats‚Äô tinny bleating through the trailer, and endless stretches of fields and trees splashing against the blue horizon.

Finally, I turned down a gravel road that wasn't so much a road as a suggestion. It was little more than a dirt trail, rutted and framed by towering oaks that looked like they‚Äôd seen the Civil War come and go. The deeper I drove, the thicker the woods got, the world tinted in the wavy sepia tones of the dead of summer.

And then, like driving to the beach and seeing the ocean, I saw it.

Now, you know by now I have a lot of experience with kudzu. Hell, I had made it a part-time job to study how to best get rid of it.

This was something else entirely.

1j0ylje,https://www.reddit.com/r/OveractiveBladder/comments/1j0ylje/combination_of_peeing_many_times_and_having/,Combination of peeing many times and having difficulty emptying bladder.,"Hi, 65 year old male here.

Every since i was in my 20's i guess.maybe earlier, i have been peeing frequently at night. It would be around every hour or so. It would be sleep, dream, pee, sleep, dream, pee. I didn't have any difficulty holding the pee. It was a case of if I don't empty my bladder, I won't be able to go back to sleep.

I did go to to the doctor about it, and he just told me not to pee.

As far as I can remember he didn't give me any medication.

No I don't have the same doctor now.

The thing is it didn't really bother me, because at least i was going back to sleep.

I guess it's only in the last few years it has been a problem for me.

One night i must have went to empty bladder 10 times or more.

Oh yes, before this, i had also developed the problem of finding it more difficult to start peeing and/or to empty the bladder

The doctor put me on some medication to make me go more. I guess I told him i felt the need to go 10 times, but was having difficulty peeing. 

I can't remember what he gave me. But they didn't help and they made me feel dizzy.

So he put me on solifenacin, which I am still taking.

Are they helping?. Yes, in a way.

Some nights are better than others.

Actually i did try not taking the medication, and i was peeing a lot more.

A good night  for me is peeing every 70 or so with sleep in between.

Well that would  be a very good night.

Usually though that would be the routine for the first 5  or 6 hours. then it would be a combination of .. Ok, lets say i need to get up in 2 hours time for work.

2 hours before, pee, dream, sleep,

20 minutes later, the same

I guess the cause is, not being to empty the bladder fully.

The next time, maybe it will empty fully, and i will get more sleep.

But sometimes though the 20 minutes can come  earlier. That's when It can be stressful for me.

I have had blood tests, etc etc.

I don't drink coffee,  tea, alcohol.

I seldom drink fizzy drinks.

I have started to drink more water. It has boosted my energy level. But it isn't helping with the pee problem.

If I do have anything in the fridge besides water, i only drink the morning time. It's usually a diluted drink .

Any other ones from Medford?,"I've known Justin for 22 23 years. He was our president in school. I'm not one to show school spirit and skipped so many assemblies to get coffee. I'm also not a morning person! Justin came in to my geometry class every other day. We had no idea if he was a teacher aid or what. But every teacher loved him so much they didn't care. I thought it was weird AF. You have a free period and you hang out with teachers? Looking back he had a free period before track. He jumped from class to class to help grading papers or just hang out. 

He got a full ride on a scholarship which was great for him but for the rest of us his family had money and he didn't need it lol. He had a brand new car in high school. Here I am buying used on a chevy s10 making payments with a paper route. His sister got a car too. Then every weekend trying to see how backstreet boys or whatever was the current band faired he's the one on kiss fm announcing it. Was so jealous! He had a great job. 

Moving to CA he of course got a job acting in a shark movie. We all made fun of him for the poor quality of the film. But years later I'm watching everwood. I freaking love teen cw doctor moves to a small town shows and all of a sudden there's this orange looking Jewish guy. Like he was so orange I had to second guess it was Justin! Of course he was cut but then we all made fun of him for being in a spray tan booth. 

Didn't hear much more until Jane the virgin. He hit it big! someone from Medford oregon escaped methford and hit it big! 

When I heard he was staring producing and more I couldn't of been more proud of him. Sitting through all this choreographed assemblies in school made me feel like he could redeem himself from that suffering. I was so proud.  He got a knock out like Blake in the movie. That got Brandon guy too. 

Weeks later I was devastated to hear Blake claimed sexual harassment. 

This guy growing up was such a nerd! He came to class when he didn't have one! He was president and one of the popular ones in high school but didn't go out drinking or anything. His name on the radio was Justin case lol. 

He's the most down to earth guys. People pleaser types. Friends with everyone. In high school I viewed him as Poplar but he was friends with the one gay we had before I came out. He was friends with skaters jocks everyone. I judged him high school incorrectly that because he's a jock and popular he's a nerd or comes from money or all the things we think at 16-17. 

Justin is still a nerd but instead of high school he values his wife and children. He values the hard work he's done for years! I think it's so fucking crazy this woman judged him on a year of knowing him and made up all this shit. I've never been so invested in a case ever! Yes because I know him. But because she chose the worst possible person to do this with. Which makes me laugh. I love Justin and could not be more proud of him. That movie was a huge success. He did a Disney movie. Started a company. 

I fucking can't wait to see how all this plays out! He's been a nerd and such a good person his whole life there's no way he loses. ",29,1740832658.0,JustinBaldoni,7,0.96,False

It seems like they all love us even though we are never going out of our way to be friendly in return. 

Anyone ever wonder why these people keep coming round? I know it sounds harsh.

I feel like my body will kind of ignore it until it sees there's work to do (ie breakfast). I've been trying to avoid coffee until at least an hour after I take them to see if I can tell when they kick in.

But one factor which I think is hugely underrated is what you've been eating (or not eating).

Like, I find that the same beans made the same way with my Switch will taste RADICALLY different depending on what I've had for breakfast. The most marked difference comes if I don't have breakfast. On those days, the coffee tends to taste pretty flat and lacking in brightness and juiciness, probably because my palate hasn't opened up. 

But on the days where I do have breakfast (particularly if contains fat, such as scrambled eggs or smoked salmon), the clarity of the coffee just seems to shoot up! Anyway just thought I'd splurge out these thoughts because it only just occurred to me. I guess it's similar to how wine can taste way better or way duller depending on what we eat, but that's a universally-acknowledged aspect of wine, whereas with coffee it doesnt tend to be talked about from what I can see.",34,1740831103.0,pourover,22,0.95,False
