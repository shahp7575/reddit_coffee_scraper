Any suggestions?   This is something I'll never do again.   I'd buy some good coffee for anyone that could help me do it myself, or do it for me.

The two bin files I need are the current MRISCO firmware for a Voxelab Aquilla with the encoder wheel reversed from a standard Ender firmware.  I have upgraded to a 4.2.7 board from that nasty H one.   The configurator settings [are like this](https://imgur.com/a/6Gf8d4Y).    When you choose Aquilla in the configurator it automatically sets the encoder wheel to be reversed for the Aquila.

The other firmware change is for my stock Ender 3 Max Neo.    I put a Microswiss NG Revo metal hot end to print nylon.   I need the max temp to be 295 instead of the 260 for a stock Max.

Can anyone give me a hand?    I would greatly appreciate you.   This is driving me nuts.

1i8mu58,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i8mu58/captain_fantastic_fights_the_climate/,Captain Fantastic Fights The Climate,"It was early morning in deep space. The bright stars were still visible from the night before as always. On the S.S. Shipymcshipface, the crew members started to walk the halls to start their day. Doctors shuffled drearily toward the med bay not yet having their morning stimulants. Couples snuck out of the holodecks from the night before. The smell of oil wafted through the vents as the daily changes were prepared. The only place where people were being loud was the ship's bridge.

""They named a street after him, but had to change it because no one could cross and survive."" AWFL said in her robotic morning voice. Annazine and Asena laughed while Thomas and Benjamin rolled their eyes at their consoles.

""He has a bear rug in his quarters. The bear's not dead, it's just afraid to move."" Annazine added, increasing the laughter.

From the end of the bridge, the door opened to Captain Fantastic walking in with his morning rum and coffee.

""Status Report!"" Fantastic ordered, more with his biceps than his mouth.

""The holodecks need to be deep cleaned. Other than that, there is nothing to report."" Asena responded as she handed him a blank sheet of paper, as had been the morning ceremony for hundreds of years.

""So what was with all the laughter?"" He asked, continuing his half of the ceremony by fake reading the blank piece of paper.

""Just talking about you before you came in."" AWFL admitted.

""Captain! Priority message from mother hen. I repeat sir! Priority message from mother hen!"" Shouted Benjamin from the communications console.

""My god."" Captain Fantastic breathed as he removed his sunglasses. ""This can't be.""

""Captain! We need orders sir!"" Annazine cried as she began typing nonsense at her console.

""Oversaturated light alert! Social Stations! Now!"" Captain Fantastic ordered as he leaped to his captain's chair in the center of the room. Immediately the bridge lighting increased to make the crew look more appealing. With a loud crash and bang, AWFL used her foot to kick debris and miscellaneous items out of view of the camera. Asena returned to her former position near the captain to act out the blank paper morning ceremony again. Benjamin and Thomas remained at their post, questioning their career choices.

""Benjamin! Prepare to answer! Three, Two, One, Answer!"" Captain Fantastic ordered with a knife-hand wave.

In a moment of dread the face of a woman that looked much like Fantastic appeared on screen. Her hair was cut at an edge, her wine glass had lipstick on it, the scentophone filled the room with the smell of spray-on tan.

""Ahhh! My eyes! Fant, Fant is that you? Lighting, set at 50 percent."" Boomed the voice on the screen. Immediately the lighting system agreed and lowered the saturation levels.

""Good morning mom, how ya been?"" Fantastic said, making sure to sit straight in the captain's chair.

""Annabelle, what have you been feeding him? He's gotten fat."" The voice on the screen continued.

""Good morning Mrs. Astic. It's Anna ZINE actually."" Annazine corrected for the thousandth time while she continued to type away at her console, afraid to make eye contact.

""I'm doing good Fant, your father is on a work trip so I'm bored. Hold up. Boy, Boy is that your old AWFL I see?""

""Hello Mrs. Astic."" AWFL stated robotically.

""Boy are you still banging your sex doll!?"" Mrs. Astic shouted from several star systems away.

""Mother she's an Artifically Womanized Fembot Lovedoll. She is not a sex doll. The programming is completely different."" Captain Fantastic defended, more for the honor of his crewmate than himself.

""You're bangin' your property. Sentient sure, but she's still your legal property. What would the founding fathers think? It's damn near unAmerican."" Mrs. Astic continued while pouring herself another glass of wine from the box.

""Damnit, mother that's-"" Captain Fantastic exclaimed through irritation.

""Did you just curse! Anna you know what to do."" His mother ordered. Annazine was already on it with the spray bottle to shoot water at the captain. ""You best pray for forgiveness!""

""Our father, who art in heaven, drill baby Jesus drill."" Fantastic begrudgingly recited.

""Your half-brother, Captain Amazing, he settled down on a nice planet already. A whole planet of females in need of a male to mate with. The whole Zing bloodline multiplied by 20 last year. When are you gonna settle down? It's almost like you don't want me to have grandkids.""

""Mom, it's great to hear from you but the day is beginning. Is there anything you need?"" Captain Fantastic asked as a vein in his forehead began to twitch.

""Well you see, I was talking to Inna earlier today. You remember Inna. Inna was telling me about how she's been trying to get ahold of you and I wanted to check on ya."" She began to say. Fantastic began to sweat as he remembered his childhood friend. ""So she needed at least 30 seconds to trace the call so she could come find you. Anyway, I gotta go. Good talking to ya."" She admitted before the screen turned back to an image of the space around them. The bridge was frozen in terror at the future they were about to witness.

""Everyone! Cleaning stations!"" Captain Fantastic ordered as he jumped from his chair and immediately started wiping the chair of any visible dirt. The order was relayed across the ship and every communication speaker. In every nook and cranny of the S.S. Shipymcshipface, every crew member began to furiously clean. The scent of pine and evergreen wafted through the halls to cover up the sting of the bleach.

""Captain! Stealth ship approaching!"" Shouted Benjamin from the navigation console. Fantastic had a fleeting thought of firing a warning shot, but had to kick it out of his mind. ""It's Dom Inna Trix Sir!"" Benjamin continued.

""Hold her outside!"" Captain Fantastic ordered.

""She is not slowing down sir! She's on a collision course with the hangar bay!"" Thomas added.

""Open hangar doors!"" Fantastic begrudgingly flipped his orders.

A loud screech could be heard across the ship as the stealth ship rubbed against the metal of the still-opening hangar bay doors.

""Prepare for ceremony!"" Captain Fantastic shouted. Immediately the room was filled with holographic projections of patriotic symbols and a bright America Prime flag on the ceiling.

The door at the end of the bridge opened up and a beautiful woman walked in as if she owned the place. Unlike everyone else, her military uniform was pitch black and made entirely of leather. She carried a stick-styled whip and threw her leather coat to one of her security guards.

""Dom on deck!"" Shouted Annazine. Immediately everyone stood to attention. In the olden days, she would have been akin to a 'commodore.' Even the civilian members of the ship stood at attention as she was not only the leader of the military but also one of the main leaders of humanity. In the ancient subtitles of Earth the title of 'Dom' had meant 'family.' It also meant 'drives really fast,' but mostly it represented 'family.' With this title, Dom Inna Trix was held as the highest leader of the family of all citizens on America Prime. As a galactic space princess, Asena simply nodded her head in respect. Inna Trix did the same to her in recognition of her title.

""At ease."" She announced, her voice somehow filling every inch of the room. She turned to look directly at Captain Fantastic. Without a word, she extended her hand and lured him in with a finger. ""Follow me."" She said leading him to his own quarters. He followed close behind and left the rest of the crew outside the soundproof walls of the captain's quarters.

""Dirty Boy."" She said as she collected the dirt on his end table with her finger. She was quick to snap her whip on the table. Dom Inna Trix was the only one who could make Captain Fantastic jump as he did.

""Welcome aboard Dom Inna. May I ask what the purpose is of your visit?"" Fantastic asked as Inna pushed him down onto the bed.

""America Prime is in dire need of your help Captain. Have you ever heard of Climate Change? One."" Inna Trix asked as she tied the soft rope around Fanastic's hand.

""An ancient myth of old Earth. Something about climate change, two, being caused by burning oil."" Captain Fantastic answered.

""It's no longer a myth."" Inna admitted. ""Climate change, three, is somehow becoming reality for the first time ever in American history."" She clicked a button on her whip and a hologram of America Prime appeared in the center of the room. The beautiful green gem in space was a modern wonder in terraforming. Rivers cleaned with menthol twisted around the miles of plastic grass and trees. Unlike Earth, America Prime didn't have an atmosphere. Which led to their wonderous works of art being viewed without litter and the need to trim or cut the plants. Dull boulders and cliffs had been painted chrome to shine for centuries all across the beautiful marble. At the sight of his perfect homeland, Captain Fantastic couldn't help but breathe a sigh of appreciation.

""She looks perfect to me. No Climate change, four, to see."" Captain Fantastic said as he gazed at the glory of America Prime.

""Look closer."" Inna Trix said as she zoomed in on one of the plastic tree leaves. The zoomed-in image showed a microscopic being that once devastated all human life for eons. An algae cell was shown splitting into two cells bringing more deestation to the plastic plant.

""Is that, Nature!?"" Captain Fantastic shouted in pain as Dom Inna Trix poured wax on his chest.

""Climate Change, five, in action. The same nature that sent us hurricanes, plagues, tsunamis, duststorms. The same nature that murdered billions of humans, has finally found America Prime. Climate Change, six, has become a reality."" Inna explained as the image continued to show more and more life forms.

""But surely climate change, seven, can be stopped somehow."" Captain Fantastic said as the hologram switched from America Prime to another planet.

""It can Fant. By using the ancient writings of the myth we've discovered that we can defeat it by burning enough oil. As long as nature doesn't have an 'ozone layer' to hide in, we can fight back against climate change, eight."" Inna continued as she snapped her whip on the metal of the bed frame.

""This is the world of 7-10. It could be the world of Astic if you would help us."" Inna said. Fantastic's mother's words rang in his head about his brother, Captain Amazing having a planet to himself already.

""We need you and your crew to go to 7-10 and make a deal to get their oil to save America Prime from climate change nine."" Inna continued. Nine. Nine times they had said 'climate change' ten. After being said ten times it was sure to attract any advertising AI to either promote their predicament or hide it from any eavesdroppers.

""Of course Dom Inna Trix. Whatever I can do for America Prime, I will do."" Captain Fantastic agreed as Dom Inna Trix dimmed the lights, lit more candles, and called for Annazine, AWFL and Asena to join in the debriefing.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

""There she is captain."" Benjamin pointed out on the bridge screen. In front of the bridge was a green and blue planet of dirt and water. The world was made mostly of water and what looked like tropical islands with sandy beaches and palm trees.

""I'm not receiving any communications from the planet. There seem to be signs of a small sentient primitive civilization but we can't be sure. Pulling up the lifeforms now."" Asena relayed from her console. An example of the life form appeared on screen and it sent a chill down Fantastic's spine.

""By George! That's no sentient life form. That's a sting ray!"" Captain Fantastic exclaimed as the image appeared on the screen. Although it wasn't an exact match it was no doubt exactly like a stingray. Except, that these creatures could walk on land and were 10 feet tall.

""Gee Wilakers Captain! I thought we destroyed them all centuries ago!"" Annazine shouted at the sight of the monstrous beast."" Annazine yelped in horror.

""What are they?"" Asena asked confused as to why everyone on the bridge was suddenly on edge.

""The Irwin wars, 1972 SF. The deep state world of Britain Prime attacked the free world of Austrailia Prime by assassinating Ambassador Irwin, the 'Heart of Austrailia.' Using genetically engineered stingrays Austrailia Prime was almost wiped out. All stingrays were enhanced to be incredibly violent with no regard for human life. Only with the help of America Prime was Australia Prime saved."" AWFL explained with a quick search in her mind's internet.

At the sight of the stingrays, Captain Fantastic's patriotism couldn't help but overflow. Whatever primitive civilization that was trying to be born on this planet would need the stingray horde removed if they had any chance of survival.

""Attention all crew! Prepare for planetary invasion! Battle Stations!"" Captain Fantastic ordered across the ship via the comms. Immediately the halls were filled with crewmembers ripping off what clothes they could to prepare for battle. Captain Fantastic and the entire bridge crew took the private elevator to the hangar bay arriving and preparing themselves before anyone else got there. Over time more and more crew members entered in. Most wore swim trunks and bikinis. Some of the men in attendance decided to bring cool-looking, but functionless, body armor. Many women could be heard muttering things like, 'This is why men don't belong in combat."" In less than five minutes everyone stood at attention with their exposed skin in formation for Annazine's safety brief.

""SHET system's at the ready!"" She ordered across the hangar bay. At her order, everyone touched their wrists, all of which had a strange watch-like device on them. All were now glowing a slight yellow as every exposed atom of their bodies was now covered in an energy shield. As long as their SHET battery remained they could take any hit the stingrays threw at them.

""Now I know some of you men want to look cool in your body armor but take it off. Your Shield Hit Emitter Transmission System won't work properly with it. Remember, when you're taking a SHET in combat you must wear as little clothing as possible. If your SHET is protecting your outfit then it is not protecting your vital organs. The less clothing you wear the longer your SHET battery will last and the longer you will last in the fight."" She explained with her safety brief.

A quarter of the males began taking off their body armor. Half of them pulled out designer tops from their trunks that, arguably, would have looked cool in a fighting pose. The women around them held their composure as proud warriors in their bikini armor, truly ready for battle. The ship's AI began to tilt the SS. Shipymcshipface's hangar bay doors toward the planet below.

""Now remember!"" Captain Fantastic bellowed across the room. ""We're here to avenge Steve Irwin!"" He sliced the air with his arm causing his SHET to extend an energy blade from his hand. He immediately ran towards the open hangar bay door facing the planet and jumped into the cold blackness of space. The rest of the crew behind him followed suit. Nearly all members of the crew were now falling towards the planet in swim trunks and bikinis.

The SHET systems they wore guided them towards their predetermined drop zones created by AWFL in the seconds of their planning stage. Each team would be given an island of their own to cleanse. Each crewmate was now engulfed in the fires of atmospheric entry but their SHET kept them cool within their shield.

As the fires dissipated all of the small tropical islands came further into view. Captain Fantastic quickly spotted an empty village, clearly having been wiped out by the stingray monstrosities that now called it home. He slammed into the dirt and sand of the island with Annazine, Asena, and AWFL right behind him.

The crater they formed easily destroyed seven of the tribal huts as the stingrays tried to run. AWFL was first with her internal rifle, firing rounds indiscriminately outside the crater to form a barrier. Asena and Annazine were next with energy claws and an energy bow ripping through the stingrays at lightning speed. Captain Fantastic was last as the Stingrays began to enter the water.

With his energy sword, he slashed at the water which immediately vaporized several hundred gallons from the heat of the blade, splitting a section of the ocean. The fleeing stingrays fell to the sandy depths with no water to catch them breaking their bodies. Whatever fish bone hadn't been broken by the fall was soon crushed by the surrounding water quickly crashing in to fill the void.

The four of them ignited their SHET system's propulsion and shot forth through the water to fight back against the remaining stragglers. Each of their defensive weapons easily locked onto a new target after each victory.

Ka-pow! DA-Zing! Chop! Whoosh! Flaz! Kee! Pop! Veeesh!

The battle raged on across the planet for three days. At night the crew would gather for grilled stingray and barbeque. They would play games on the beaches, get close in the hidden grottos, sing and dance around the bone-littered bonfires, and much more. During the day they would press their defensive war against the remaining stingrays, certain that today would be the day the war ended.

The primitive civilization that had built the villages was nowhere to be found. It was hard, but the crew accepted in time that the horde of stingrays had already decimated whatever civilization was trying to struggle out of the Stone Age. They continued to fight their depression with food and drink but it was AWFL's land survey that truly lifted their spirits.

The oil on this planet was easily enough to replace the reserves of America Prime. With precision shots from orbit, the oil pockets were easily broken and the blue waters of the planet were quickly shifted to a warm black as the oil covered the top layer of the water. All across the world, the sandy beaches were all lubricated with the black gold of industry. The once blue marble had now become a liberated shining black sphere of freedom and democracy.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It had been one month since the return of the S.S. Shipymcshipface to America Prime. Captain Fantastic and his crew all sat in attendance at the honor ceremony. Above the awards ceremony flew thousands of fuel tankers delivering the oil to their new home. The evils of nature would never again threaten the lives of humanity, not as long as he was alive. America Prime, his home, would never be a place of hurricanes, tornadoes, or even simply a breeze that causes a child's ice cream cone to fall to the dirt. His home would be forever free from nature's corruption.

""Captain Fant Astic."" Dom Inna Trix announced, more to the uproarious crowd of patriots in attendance than to him. ""I present to you this medal."" She continued as she opened an ornate box. The huge screens around the gigantic room showed the golden medal to the thousands of Americans in attendance. He looked around and saw that his crewmates were all receiving the same medal for their heroic deeds as well. Engraved into the gold was an eagle perched on top of a tree. She spoke as she placed the medal around his neck.

""With this medal, we recognize the courage and bravery of humanity's finest. Through your resilience and the resilience of your crew, the ozone layer has been destroyed. Nature will never again haunt the grounds of America Prime. I present to you, the medal of Environmentalism."" The crowd erupted into cheers.",1,1737691339.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

The new hours are an early morning shift which would be excellent for him but may put more strain on me. I want him to be happy, but I also have reservations about my ability to do the mornings solo and selfishly am apprehensive about losing things I value within my morning routine. ¬†

My husband is the primary go-to in the AM because I take longer to get ready with hair/makeup etc. We both leave the house by 7am and each take one child to drop off as their care places are in separate directions. ¬†¬†¬†



New Job Pros:

Less hours overall for husband and he finishes earlier ‚Äì has said he‚Äôll use some of this time to do the household chores too so we‚Äôre not doing these on the weekend.

The kids get picked up earlier and are in care for less time

Less stress for husband and more opportunities to do something different in future (new company, different culture, lots of varied positions)

Husband can attend kids afternoon activities



New Job Cons:

Currently my routine looks like this:

5am-6am walk dog

6am-7am, mostly get myself ready, help with kids

7am ‚Äì one kid drop off and at work by 7.30am

7.30am ‚Äì 8am ‚Äì coffee and alone time before work starts at 8am

New routine would mean I can‚Äôt walk the dog because no one would be home with the kids. In theory I could do it in the evening, but I often don‚Äôt have the energy after work, and I like to do it in the morning because I‚Äôm not missing out on kid time ‚Äì they‚Äôre still asleep, it gives me energy for the day and wears the dog out so he‚Äôs more relaxed during the day when we‚Äôre not home. ¬†

I would have to do everything to get the kids ready by myself, whereas currently I only assist -¬† estimated at 30-45minutes

I would have to do two drop offs in two separate directions ‚Äì estimated at 30mins extra.

Which essentially means I‚Äôd be arriving at work right on start time (8am) or later, no alone time.

My parents had a similar work dynamic and I always saw my Mum as stressed and rushing us to get out the door, or making us do things ourselves that we were probably too young to be capable of ‚Äì out of necessity, not cruelty but it didn‚Äôt feel like this as a kid, whilst I saw Dad as the fun one who picked us up early and hung out with us all the time.

TLDR ‚Äì husband‚Äôs new job offer would be much better for him and probably better for the kids, but worse for me. I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm asking, I guess I just don‚Äôt know how I feel about it. I‚Äôm very excited for my husband and really proud of him for securing the new role but I‚Äôm also (selfishly) a little scared about what it will do to my mental health to have stressful mornings and lose things that are important to me. Maybe I just need someone to point out the positives? Or tell me it won‚Äôt be that bad? Is anyone doing solo mornings and thriving?",2,1737691074.0,workingmoms,2,0.75,False

I also have really bad social anxiety that if I'm not with a friend, I freak out

This past summer I was over at my friend's house, and I asked her if she knew what she was wearing to HOCO. She told me that she may be going with another friend out of town for that friend's birthday. I thought for sure that the date would change (since the friend could have easily moved it to the next weekend) and they would both go to HOCO. 

The dance comes up, and she says for sure that she's not going to the dance. I brush it off at the moment and go with another friend. The problem is, my other friend leaves the dance after we'd been for about an hour. I enjoy school dances, especially toward the end when all the other people who are there just to show off their dresses leave. 

I stay until the end of the dance, hanging out with a sort-of-friend. It was all fine and dandy until I realized that my sister (who was a freshman at the time) was going to an after party. I wasn't invited to any (ever), and my sort-of-friend was hanging out with a group of actually good guys. I tried to get her attention to ask if I could tag along, but she didn't get the memo. I end up walking to my car and sobbing. I cried the whole way home (25 minutes). 

When I tell my friend (the one who ditched me) my HOCO experience, she tells me that prom will be better. She doesn't apologize for not going. Instead, she says that she can host an after party after prom. The problem is, prom isn't like HOCO (imo) because the dresses are too long for people to really dance. I was angry at her for just brushing me off and not going to HOCO after promising the previous year that she would go.

And now it just seems like every time I try to get together with her, something comes up. For example, I keep on mentioning hanging out via a sleepover, but she never gives me a date in time in order to ask off work (she doesn't have a job). And we were supposed to get coffee one morning before school, but she cancelled at 9:00 the night before because she wanted to ""sleep in"".

She brings him to a lot of places we go and you can definitely tell he is not a service dog but no one has ever said anything to her because of his vest. There is this local coffee shop we go to often and we both had our dogs with us , so i was also going to bring my dog in thinking they were pet friendly since she always brings hers in. She looked at me and was like no you can't bring him in he is not a service animal. One time i straight up told her that he is not a service animal and she should not be bringing him into places and she seemed offended and said ""he's in training"" at this time he was currently doing basic dog training,(he did 4 sessions ) ... nothing that a service animal is taught and spends the first years of their life learning . It really just grinds my gears because I know he's not a service animal, and I know if he were to come into contact with a real service dog he would be barking like crazy, pulling the lead and be all over the place trying to play with this dog and completely interrupt them from their person and task. I don't know what to do because there's people out there who actually need their service dogs and then there's people like her pretending that her dog is a service dog and it just bothers me but i don't know how to get it across to her that what she is doing is wrong and could end up actually hurting someone.

If you want to find your soulmate, you must do two things that the red pill supports and one thing the red pill frowns on.

* **Measure Love**
* **Ghost Ruthlessly**
* **Decouple Sex**

**\[1\] Measure Love**

Love is measured through sex. You should not accept love through faith based arguments that mandate less sex, worse sex or delayed sex in place of some other bullshit anymore than you should accept squaloring in poverty while accepting that this is god‚Äôs plan. Unrequited sex is the opiate of the blue pill.

Love can be measured in two ways:

**(a)** **Exact Match:** Her frequency, time-table and options with you better match or exceed all previous partners. If she always waited three dates then match that. If she submitted to anal then expect anal. If she ever lets it slip that some guy, somewhere, got something better, then dump her on the spot.

**(b) 1st Date:** If you don‚Äôt know any of the above, then assume she‚Äôs had sex on the first date, with some dude, somewhere. Hold her to this.

The only men who don‚Äôt measure love are losers because they know they‚Äôve gotten the shorter end of the stick. Such men love the fact that they can‚Äôt measure, compare or transparently know anything about the woman who‚Äôs using them because this allows them to protect their fragile ego. On some level this is a form of self-hypnosis. Most of these men will also claim they‚Äôre not losers by virtue of a moral majority of women agreeing to take advantage of them.¬†

**\[2\] Ghost Ruthlessly**

From the perspective of female psychology it‚Äôs morally reprehensible to be honest with women or have standards. You need to be dishonest and hide your standards. As an example if you want sex on your first date, many women are OK with the idea. However they‚Äôre not OK with you being honest about this and they‚Äôre not OK with being aware of you having this standard. Their preference is for you to lie and manipulate them into sex on a first date rather than being honest and straightforward. They want the plausible deniability to say that sex on a first date happened ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù when in reality it was a planned, deliberately escalated, unnatural action.

If a woman doesn‚Äôt give you sex on the first date or by X, then just ghost her. The second you leave the restaurant, her front door or wherever you need to accept that she is incapable of loving you. She only wants to keep you around if she can treat you worse than men she previously treated better. Cut your losses and let some blue piller end up with her in a dead bedroom.

She doesn‚Äôt deserve an explanation because she doesn‚Äôt love you. But more importantly you shouldn‚Äôt tell her why for practical reasons. Let her fill in the blank. The best outcome is for her to think it‚Äôs about her appearance or some personality flaw and not about lack of sex. This way she‚Äôll direct her emotions inward with depression instead of outward with anger to some TEA watch group.

**\[3\] Decouple Sex**

The above method will have a high attrition rate. You need to accept this going in. But remember that the goal is not sex. The goal is to find your soulmate and sex is the only proven reliable marker for proving her hormones actually want you at a primal level.

Having a high attrition rate is a challenge because while you‚Äôre getting rejected you‚Äôll be tempted to become a blue pill man who settles for inferior unrequited love.

The solution is to decouple sex from relationships. While you‚Äôre hunting for your soulmate, you should regularly feast on sex to the point that losing on a date is painless. The best way to do this is to reward yourself immediately after a woman rejects you with a paid experience that washes away your memory of the encounter. Before you go on a date you should already have a paid sexual backup plan in mind. You should have some provider on speed dial that you can immediately go to from the restaurant, coffee shop or front door of her apartment.

With this approach you can both find your soulmate and bypass the extreme rejection rate in a very pleasant way.",1,1737690815.0,PurplePillDebate,12,0.57,False

Am I making the right choice?,"So as a bit of background info, I met my boyfriend when I was 19 and he was 23. This was my first relationship ever and the first guy to honestly ever show me any sort of interest. We've been together since then however, it seems looking back now that there's been so much wrong with the relationship and I want to end things however, I feel so guilty. This is gonna be super lengthy because so much has happened in the last few years that now seem so wrong in our relationship. Here's a few examples:

**Dishonesty and Lack of accountability:**¬†In the beginning of our relationship, he repeatedly lied to me about going to clubs and bars, and when questioned would say he 'loved me so much and didnt know how i could accuse him of such things"". when caught with evidence, he said it was because of his depression and on another occasion also lied that his grandma died. She didn't actually die he made that up and when again confronted said he meant ""she was dead to him"" as she had said something mean to him.

**Infidelity**: ¬†He cheated on me several times and still insists he didnt. This is despite him being on bumble behind my back and meeting a girl off there for dinner, constantly following random girls from being at clubs and bars behind my back meand even me finding messages of him asking a girl to meet him for drinks. another girl also contacted me and told me they slept together. i knew he had met her behind my back twice but he and his friends insisted she was crazy. When i tried to get clarity on these things we'd end up in circular arguments that could go on for hours, with him blaming me for escalating things and me often getting confused, wondering if it was true that i escalated things for no reason and forgetting the original point of the discussion.

**Toxic arguments**: He would often also corner me, block exits, shove or nudge me lightly during these arguments, call me names (c\*nt, telling me all i do is assume things and overreact) and would take my phone and wallet from me during them so I couldn't call anyone or leave. Early in the relationship, I was trying to go to bed while he was talking and he grabbed me really hard by both shoulders and yelled ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm talking to you‚Äù which scared me. When I tried to leave he started hitting things around him. He has also broken my phone twice during arguments.

He also frequently drags both mine and his friends into these arguments, framing me as unreasonable and antagonistic. (eg, we fought about him meeting a girl behind my back and he told friends i went ballistic at him for a poorly landed joke)

**I turn into a horrible person when we argue.**¬†The way we argue with him blocking my exit and taking my possessions away from me to prevent me from leaving has resulted in me shoving/hitting him a few times. i know this was wrong of me and i was abusive. i tried to break up with him then but he said i should stay and fix things instead. so i tried but the cycle of dishonesty, lack of accountability and bad arguments kept continuing and so I tried so hard to keep my emotions in check but it was so difficult. I felt constantly on edge or drained.

**Lack of effort:**¬†He would never buy me gifts for birthdays or christmases ahead of time, instead waiting for us to meet for me to pick out my own gift. he also would always be late for dates and for dinners with my family.

He also just doesn't seem to care much. Last year I got a tattoo and requested for him to come get me in 1.5hours, with a sweet coffee as I often get shivery/cold after tattoo appointments. i came out of the appointment and called only to find out he had gone to a friend's house instead. This is just an example of many such instances.

Every time I have tried to break up with him, he has came to my house to talk me out of it and has threatened to harm himself a few times. I'm not sure if he can feel me pulling away, I have told him multiple times I am unhappy and he has told me to push through it. He seems to be making a bit more of an effort now but I just feel nothing for him. I want to end things but he told me to wait until after Valentine's Day. How do I go about ending things and sticking to it, while minimising any drama that may come from doing so?

It‚Äôs almost midday Friday, and it‚Äôs a long weekend so I know I need to prioritise things like phone calls to potential future supports, and emails, so I am prepared for this meeting. 

However, I have this terrible coping mechanism of simply lying on my bed and doom scrolling when I am overwhelmed. I‚Äôm so tired, I sleep well but I just have no motivation to do anything.

I have been diagnosed with ADHD by a psychiatrist in the past and prescribed vyvanse or dexamphetamines to help with that, but the psychiatrist I am under has said she doesn‚Äôt think I have adhd and is withholding my stimulants. I was okay with that when I was first admitted but now I‚Äôm feeling like this lack of ability to do things is possibly from the lack of medication for my adhd.

I thought it was a shame for the content, so I am posting this as a post here:

# How and why rising bread works and how to rise non-wheat/non-rye dough

In order for baked goods to rise, (1) gas(es) must be introduced into the dough and (2) the dough needs to be able to trap at least some of the gas(es) being introduced.

The introduction of gas into the dough can be done by (a) biological means: microbes metabolising starches in the dough producing CO2, or (b) chemical means: a chemical agent such as baking soda releases CO2 when heated, and (c) physical: water in the dough turns into steam when heated.

The retention of gas in the dough depends on the ingredients, in particular the flours. Wheat flour produces doughs with superior gas retention over all other flours because of a unique characteristic of wheat, also known as the anomaly of wheat:

The non-water-soluble proteins of wheat, called gliadins and glutenins form a highly elastic gel when they get entangled with each other in the presence of water. This hydrogel is called gluten, also gluten network or gluten matrix. Due to its high elasticity, gluten has very high gas retention because as more gas is introduced, the gel will not only trap the gas leading to small bubbles to form inside the dough, but as more gas is introduced, it elastically expands around these bubbles allowing then to become larger without bursting.

Only cereals of the wheat family have proteins that form a highly elastic hydrogel. Not any other cereals and not any other plants either. Hence the moniker ""anomaly of wheat"".

The next in line is rye. The gas retention of doughs made from rye flour is not as high as that of wheat based dough, but still superior to other (cereal) flours. This too is due to a unique characteristic of rye:

Non-starch carbohydrates called arabinoxylans (AX) form a highly viscous gel when they are soaked in water and swell. Usually, AX is only present in the skins of seeds and grains, but not in the centre. In rye, AX is contained in fairly high amounts both in the skins (pericarp) and the inside (endosperm). As a result, rye dough will trap sufficient gas to rise. However, as more gas is introduced into a rye dough, small gas bubbles will burst and the gas will eventually escape since the hydrogel formed by AX is not very elastic and can't stretch much.

This is the reason why rye bread does not rise as well as wheat bread and the crumb of rye bread is typically denser than the crumb of wheat bread.

No other cereals nor plants have any equivalent characteristics to the aforementioned characteristics of wheat and rye. As a result, doughs made with flours from other cereals or plants have much less gas retention capacity. And due to the weak gas retention, they don't rise well, or won't rise at all.

Thus, when baking with any flours other than wheat or rye, it is necessary to improve the gas retention capacity by some other means.

In gluten-free baking, this is often done by adding chemical binding agents such as metyl-cellulose or semi-chemical binding agents such as xanthan, produced by bacteria and then chemically treated for extraction.

Alternatively, purely natural binding agents can also be used, such as flax seed or psyllium husk. Coincidentally, the gelling substance in psyllium husks is AX, the same substance that gives rye its gas retention capacity. This means, whatever flour is used, it is always possible to achieve a consistency similar to that of rye bread by adding the right amount of psyllium husk to the dough.

There are some tricks how to improve the gelling strength. First, the finer the psyllium husk powder, the more water it can absorb and the thicker the gel. This applies universally to all gelling substances. Second, the longer the psyllium is allowed to soak, the more water it will absorb and the better the gelling. And third, different gelling agents often complement each other and exhibit synergy which means they form a stronger gel together than one of them alone could. The maximum gelling effect is usually achieved at a specific ratio between any two gelling agents. This can be looked up in the ""Handbook of Hydrocolloids"" or obtained experimentally.

Furthermore, there are gelling agents that gel when heat is applied. The most prominent example is starch. Typically, starches gelatinise between 60 and 70 degrees (Celsius). Bakers take advantage of this by mixing starch with water and then heat it (while stirring) to obtain a gel, and once cooled, it is added to a dough for extra strength and moisture.

You can experiment with these techniques and combine them to improve the gas retention capacity of any non-wheat/non-rye based dough or gluten-free mix and thereby ultimately get a better and better rise out of it.

Here are some suggestions:

Use some psyllium husk, mill it into a very fine powder in a coffee mill, mix with 20 times its weight of water, let it soak, add to your dough.

Use some small grained oil seeds, such as flax, sesame and chia, mill it into a fine powder in a coffee mill, mix with boiling water, let it soak and cool, add to your dough.

Take some starch or some portion of your gluten-free mix, mix with water in a casserole, heat to a temperature of 65-70 degrees (Celsius) while stirring, let it cool, add to your dough.

PS: Any of these techniques can also be used with wheat and rye doughs to improve their strength and hydration.",1,1737690025.0,Bread,0,1.0,False

It's not that I'm unhappy. I have a good life and a good job where I set my own hours, and loving husband and cat (the other reason I will leave bed is if he comes in to motivate me). Sure, I like to have coffee, and a nice breakfast. I like listening to upbeat music and other things recommended in articles about morning routines. But are they exciting enough to make me want to spring out of bed the moment my eyes open to start my day? No. 

When I was a kid, I had morning cartoons to look forward to on certain days. But now I can watch or listen to anything I want, any time I want. I did manage to romanticize taking my daily vitamins by putting them into fancy bottles and calling it my apothecary. But that's not the same as looking forward to something so much that it makes you get out of where you're currently most comfortable.

Chapter 1

¬†

On a crisp and foggy morning, a tall and menacing knight adorned in ornate black and gold armour broke through the foliage into a clearing the meadow he now stumbled upon like something from a fantastical novel. Between the flowers dotting the field and the single knotted oak twisting from the center, nothing could offer this scene before him a stranger sense of tranquility, it wasn‚Äôt until he stepped further into the clearing to see a table set behind the tree, the table adorned with a picnic set complete with the red and white checkered cloth and the woven straw basket. Sitting at the head trying to set the table with haste was a snow-white rabbit, his paw outstretching to the knight in greeting as he notices the armoured man approach. As the bunny sets the final touches to the spread before them, the food not seeming to slow as he pulls tray after tray from the basket and placing them around the table. The knight stands there in awe obviously not ready to be met with a magic bunny with a magic picnic when he woke up this morning. The knights jaw ajar slightly as he gathers his thoughts before finally speaking, ""w-what a-are y-you"" the knight asks, stammering his words. The bunny looks up to the knight from what he was doing to flash him a warm and quick grin "" I am a traveller in these lands my friend, you may call me bunny, carrot joint?"" his paw extending as he offers a rolled paper cigarette that resembles a carrot. after a few minutes the knight has a warm, fuzzy feeling wash over him as the narcotics laced within the cigarette take hold, the world swirling as the bunny just stands there, eerily smiling as the knight fades from consciousness, ""enjoy the chaos my friend.""

As the knight regains his senses, his head groggy and his body sluggish as he remembers what happened, the knight springs to his feet en-guard to the bunny that now sits perched upon a fallen tree some yards away. Sir Van Bonk, as the knight be known, stands unaccustomed to his unfamiliar surroundings that now envelop his weary vision. bunny moves to speak to the knight as he notices the warrior‚Äôs unease ""I‚Äôm no enemy my enameled friend, merely a guiding hand"" as the rabbit speaks, his lips curl into a crooked smirk as he mentions his guiding hand. van bonk just stares dumbfounded before starting forward as if remembering ""YOU FUCKING DRUGGED ME, I SHOULD STRING YOU UP AND GUT YOU RIGHT HERE"" his voice delving into almost a growl as his anger envelops his mind. bunny however just looks amused at the knight's anger and hops out of the way of van's first swing with relative ease, bounding to a rock nearby behind the knight, as van bonk spins around in a flurry of fury at his failed attempt, the rabbit lets out a soft chuckle that takes van aback for a moment ""what‚Äôs so funny rat?"" the rabbit only laughs harder at his insult stunning the knight in his own confusion ""first of all, do I look like a rat to you?"" the bunny nonchalantly stepping forward waving his paws at the forest around them ""second of all you‚Äôre in a strange forest after being drugged by a talking rabbit in a mystical meadow, did you really think I was going to be that easy to kill?"" the bunny stepping closer his hand outstretched again offering another rolled joint ""no tricks this time, just relax"" the creature continues, patting the ground beside him as he plops himself down bringing a lit match to his own joint and starting to puff away. van sits wearily beside the bunny but begrudgingly accepts the smoke as he himself admits he is wound tight after this whole ordeal.

After about 5 minutes of each smoking in silence, taking in the serenity of the forest around them, it is van that breaks the silence finally calm and able to arrange his thoughts. ""Bunny, where the hell am I?"" The knight asks abruptly, taking another drag of his joint before continuing. ""What did you do to me, and why did you bring me here."" Bunny pauses for a seemingly excessive timeframe before speaking, his words carefully chosen before he talks. ""The system my boy, they control everything that you see"" the bunnies look grows solemn as if reliving moments best left in the past before speaking again. ""I am an agent of chaos, I rival the system by abolishing their drones where I can"" the bunny looks up at van with a soft, hopeful smile "" and I bring in souls like yourself to even the odds so to speak."" van bonk ponders this for a moment, is this really happening he asks himself , his thoughts and emotions swirl once more, but what choice does he have. Van ponders his situation momentarily before turning to the bunny and speaking ‚ÄúI will aid your mission, with one prerequisite, I will need help‚Äù bunny smiles at vans acceptance and nods in agreeance ‚ÄúI have just the place‚Äù bunny remarks standing to start their journey ‚Äúit‚Äôs a tavern in the main city, it is called The Chaos Corner‚Äù.

They enter the city limits after a brisk walk, bunny filling van in n the layout of this strange land. It seems this world has most the same as his previous home except this world is riddled w magic beings and the laws of biology that he was accustomed to don‚Äôt necessarily matter here as many of the animals speak and act as a human would. The system on the other hand is all too familiar, powerful and rich beings that hide behind walls of autonomous drones exert their rule by forcing the land to pay their taxes. ‚ÄúSounds like the government back home‚Äô van thinks to himself as bunny leads him through the bustling metropolis, creatures of all dimensions swirling around them as they all go about their day. Van comes to find the cities name from bunny, Noornia, ‚Äúa mystical name for a magical place‚Äù van had replied with bunny nodding his agreement before turning a corner into an alleyway. As bunny stops before a dilapidated tavern that has a sign above the door that tells van this is the tavern bunny spoke of. As the pair enter, the minor crowd that‚Äôs inside falls silent at the sight of the knight, his large stature filling the empty space in the doorway as he stands behind bunny. The rabbit moves towards the bartender and van, a tall white wolf with features in part like a human, aside from the wolf head, tail, and paws that is. The bartender steps forward, his paws already moving to grab a drink for the rabbit. ‚ÄúWhat will it be knight‚Äù the bartender stands thee, his tattered black suit a stark contrast to his white fur. ¬†‚ÄúHe will have what I‚Äôm having‚Äù bunny starts, cutting of van as he swirls his glass of deep golden-brown liquid ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a big boy, he can handle it‚Äù the bunny smirks as he pats the stool beside him. The bartender slides a glass stopping It in front of van before pulling a bottle of liquor from under the counter and pouring van a short glass of the drink.¬† After a short time, van is becoming increasingly drunk and he turns to bunny, slurring his words, ‚Äús-so b-b-bunny, where I-is my help‚Äù van audibly holds back a gag as the liquor tries to repeat on him. His fuzzy companion just smiles and sips his drink ‚Äúthey will come my inebriated friend, this bar is home for everyone that opposes the system and its droids‚Äù bunny must pause to stop van from falling of his stool, making sure he is steady again before continuing ‚Äúyou will find help here, but more importantly for you, one can also find a bed‚Äù bunny nods to the bartender as the wolf slides a key to bunny for a room downstairs. The pair move to help the large knight down the stairs, stumbling a few times as van trips over his own footing. Now in the basement van can see that the basement has been dug out to make more rooms, hallways now lined with doors like an apartment building. Bunny swings the door to vans new home open to reveal a surprisingly spacious room, a made bed in the corner, a door to an adjoining bathroom in the other a fireplace on the left wall lights itself as they enter and starts crackling and filling the room with its warmth. The wolf and rabbit help the knight to his bed, his armor clanking as he falls, already falling asleep. The wolf leaves bunny there and heads back upstairs as the rabbit stands there a moment staring at the slumbering knight. ‚ÄúCould you finally be the one to do it?‚Äù bunny says out loud to himself, lingering a moment before closing the door as he leaves the room, his foreboding thoughts lingering as he heads back to the bar.

The next morning van wakes in his new room unsure how he got there but glad to see he is alone with his thoughts for the first time, he notices a cup of coffee and some biscuits sitting on a tray that also has a neat pile of carrot joints sat next to the cup, symbolizing who left it there. Van sips the hot coffee greedily, puffing on a carrot joint as he tries to wrap his mind around the last days events. He decides finally to go try and find bunny and makes his way up to the bar to find him sitting there puffing away on his smoke as patrons start to file in for their day of drinking behind him. ‚Äúbunny, I need to know how I fit into all this, why me‚Äù van starts his questions after a brief greeting is exchanged ‚Äúwell boyo its simple, agents of chaos are usually those that oppose authority and control‚Äù the rabbit starts his explanation ‚Äúyou rose through the ranks of knighthood to reach a point of leadership because you abhorred being told you couldn‚Äôt help‚Äù ¬†Van stares blankly obviously not understanding what that has to do with anything ‚Äúyou have a desire to create safety for all yes?‚Äù bunny asks and van tips his head in agreement ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs what I want, what we all want, peace and order is great and all but there‚Äôs a fine line between that and fear and control, and the system crossed that line many years ago‚Äù that same begrudging look flooding his eyes with unfelt grief.",1,1737689420.0,chaosLORE,0,1.0,False

""Grab your dicks if you're in the 306"" are pretty unlikely life-changing words, but for Melissa, Doug and Mischa, they were. Ever since his arrival, Melissa had felt herself imprisoned in a vortex of shame, anger, pain and sadness. She watched as Zombie Melissa cleaned the house, went to work, and left food at top of the basement steps for this teenager who had arrived in place of the baby she'd spent 15 years and all her money trying for. Sometimes she was horrified. Mostly, she didn't feel anything.

Zombie Melissa did laundry when Mischa wasn't home. But that night, Zombie Melissa fucked up and heard Mischa working on his rap music from the old office he'd moved into. She dropped the basket. On autopilot, she went over to the other corner of the basement. She got out the boxes of zines she'd made as teen in the 90s, one with a comic of a rapper who used ""Grab your dicks if you're in the 306"" as a tagline. She spent the entire night doing something she hadn't done in all the years of tests, miscarriages,  injections, pills, sonograms, travel, failure, research, loan applications, home studies, fire inspections and more: she cried. All night long. 

In the morning, Melissa was reborn. She heard her own voice, saying this was a crisis and she needed help. She, Doug and Mischa went for more therapy that she imagined possible. Individual therapy to help her and Doug process their infertility journeys and for Mischa to deal with the death of his mother and the loss of his life in Ukraine. Marriage counseling for her and Doug. And family therapy for all of them. It took time, but slowly and surely, they became one.

Mischa rejected their offer to move upstairs, but bonded with Doug in fixing up hia basement space. Melissa bonded with him over music and creating. Guided carefully by their therapist, they sat Mischa down and told him that they loved having him there and considered him their son, but that good parents supported their children's goals and dreams, and that he was welcome to stay with them in Uranium as long as he wanted, but if he chose to return to Ukraine, they would help. 

It took a while. Mischa got Noel's old job at the Taco Bell to earn money. When Melissa and Doug won triple damages from the adoption agency, they gave part of the money to Mischa. He moved to Ukraine and settled near Talia.

One of life's most painful lessons is that love and attraction do not, in fact, conquer all, and Talia and Mischa taught that to one another over the next 18 months. Mischa's more outgoing nature and admiration for traditional Ukrainian culture clashed with the introversion and interest in all things Western that led Talia to a lengthy online relationship with a YouTube rapper. When they broke up, Mischa had decided to become a music teacher, because of the importance of chamber choir in his own life. 

He got into university easily (he had had the highest SAT scores at St. Cassian's, much to Ocean's chagrin). He dated a little bit and took a position in his hometown of Odessa. During one of the prep days for the coming year, there was a knock on his classroom door.

There was a woman more beautiful than Talia or the former prime minister. Her name was Oksana and she was a speech language pathologist at the school. She wanted to talk to him about an idea she had to work together. They met for coffee that evening, and several after. The talk quickly turned from work to their lives. Soon, they were spending nearly every moment outside of work together, going to festivals, to dinner, watching movies, and working on their method. 

Two years later, they had a big traditional wedding. Noel, who Mischa had kept in touch with online, came over from Paris. Doug and Melissa traveled from Uranium and were going on to Romania to adopt a 4 year old. Father Markus sent his regrets.

Life waa good for Mischa and Oksana. They settled down and continued teaching. They had a son, and then a daughter. Oksana left her position to promote what she and Mischa called The Odessa Method to help children with speech difficulties through music. Mischa thought things would continue that way forever.

For context : I [28F] was diagnosed with BPD over 12 years ago, and my ex [27F] isnt diagnosed (that i know of) but was thinking she was BPD or NPD when we parted ways. We dated fof 2 years, and she abused me frequently during this time. Lastly, worth noting have been mostly very stable for the last 5 years, thanks to a shit ton of therapy, and nowadays my only problems are keeping my adhd and depressive episodes in check. 

The breakup was in june 2024. As you can imagine, there were a few back and forth but it was always clearly over for me. Not so much for her, until last october when everything fell apart for good. No turning back, I couldnt suffer more. Last time i saw her was 3 months ago.

As soon as people realized i was a victim of abuse, i feel like they took decisions without letting me process first or asking for what i wanted.

The abuse was made public by someone who had been a collateral damage in this, and I wasnt ready for that. I wasnt named, as the other person came forward as a victim of sexual misconduct when, in fact, i was the one targetted at the time by the sexual harassement. 

I barely received any support. while all the attention was given to the person who made it public, I had to carry myself on my own and my ex lost everything. i was very dissociated but, thinking back, it was so awful and lonely to have my pain feel irrelevant and to feel like i had no autonomy in this.

Im so angry i lost control of this in the end. So bitter ppl took actions without asking for my wishes as the primary victim. I believe she can change. And I need to have the peace of mind to know she's doing all she can to be a better person.

so i reached out last weekend. learned she's been in therapy consistently since the breakup, and it made me hopeful. we're going to meet irl for coffee on sunday. i asked to meet once every other month to catch up. no more often than this.

I wont lie that this is probably not the smartest idea, given i very much still think she is the most gorgeous girl that ever was. She can be such and wonderful, funny and talented person when she isnt destroying everything, and often we complimented each other so well. 

I hope i can keep her in my life, not as a lover bc it would be a disaster, but as a friend. But this depends on her ability to heal and change for the best.

I could use some support, kindness and reassurance, and I could use advice if maybe someone wise reads my rant ahah. What would you do if you were me, to unsure we dont get hurt again ?

You shattered me, and almost 3 years later I‚Äôm still picking up the pieces of what happened between us; how do we go from ‚ÄúI‚Äôll accept you and love you no matter what‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never be happy with someone who isn‚Äôt like me‚Äù?

In some ways, I wish we could catch up over coffee and see where the other is at but I think it‚Äôs pretty clear that wouldn‚Äôt go well for either of us. So I guess in a way this letter is me saying goodbye as much as I can.

I can‚Äôt bring you with me for what‚Äôs next, but I hope that wherever you and your new husband are going is somewhere that makes you happy; I think we both deserve happiness in the end even if it didn‚Äôt turn out to be with each other.

Although Mischa and his family were safe from the worst of the war, they decided to leave the country. Doug and Melissa did a lot to help, and by that summer, for the second time in his life, Mischa was on a plane bound for Uranium. 

Oksana found work quickly with a resettlement organization. The family stayed with Doug and Melissa for a couple of months. Uranium was even more depressed than when he left, with a lot of vacant homes. One of those  homes had belonged to Noel's grandmother and had been on the market for eight years without a single inquiry. Noel happily sold it to his old friend. Mischa and Doug spent the summer fixing it up. School was back in by the time he was done. He walked the kids to St. Cassian's and came home and realized he had nothing to do.

The next day when he walked them to school, he saw Father Markus across the parking lot. He meandered down to the vocal room to say hello. It turned out that Father Markus has first period free, and it became a routine. Mischa would stop by the Blackwood Cafe for coffees for both of them, drop the kids off, and chat. They talked about music, teaching, their lives, everything. Father Markus asked Mischa about his plans. 
Mischa said he really wanted to stay in Uranium but had been unable to find a teaching job. He talked at length about how surprisingly pleasant it was to be back. How his kids loved St. Cassian's, loved Melissa and Doug and their Romanian son. But how much he missed teaching and music and working with students. 

Father Markus listened and said nothing.

The next day, he told Mischa that he'd wanted to retire for years, but was worried it would leave St. Cassian's without a music program. He asked if Mischa would take over for him. They began making plans, with Mischa working with him through the fall and getting to know the students so Father Markus could do one last Christmas concert. After Christmas break, Mischa became St. Cassian's full-time vocal director. 

As for Father Markus, he enjoyed a pleasant retirement. He traveled while his health allowed. He became an extended member of Mischa's family, having Sunday dinner with him and his family. Mischa cut his grass and shoveled his sidewalk, or sent his kids to do it. When Father Markus died, Mischa organized a large memorial concert featuring a lot of his compositions. Its centerpiece was a huge alumni Zoom performance of ""Uranium."" Ocean, Noel, Ricky and Penny all sang on Zoom, with Constance joining the in-person performance. It was so successful that an annual alumni Zoom chorus was started to fund the Father Lewis Markus Memorial Scholarship for a St. Cassian's student who was involved in music and planned to teach. Mischa and Oksana continued to present their Odessa method at teaching conferences. And as a teen, Mischa's son dubbed himself Radioactive Bad Egg and gained a large YouTube following for his Abandoned Uranium content.",1,1737688373.0,u_KatJen76,0,1.0,False
1i8lxce,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1i8lxce/is_my_gallbladder_having_an_attack/,Is my gallbladder having an attack?,"

 
I'm pretty something is going on with my gallbladder. I am 43, Female. I am scared it's going to take months to find out what's wrong. I haven't had any abdominal pain, it's all been in my back. it started about 2.5 weeks ago. Backing up abit, TMI, I have had loose stools for a long time and it's not uncommon to eat a meal and have diarrhea or a very loose stool shortly after. It's not frequent enough that there was concern but in hindsight, I think this was the first sign something was going on. I just always chalked it up to either the food being undercooked or not re-heated to the right temperature or just something that disagreed with my stomach. My
Mom had a sensitive stomach and these issues of mine never impacted my life so I didn't think anything of it. 

So 2.5 weeks ago, I had just walked out my front door heading to work when I got a sudden sharp pain, on the right side of my chest. Stopped me in my tracks for a moment. From there, I had a sharp pain when I took a deep breath. It subsided a little after a few minutes and when I got to work 10 minutes later, it was mostly just a sharp pain when I took a deep breath. It then turned in to shoulder pain in my right shoulder--it started out feeling like a sore muscle. Since then, I've had some bloating and been gassy. Have had shoulder pain, either in the right shoulder and in the middle of my back daily, but not constant all the time, I wake up feeling normal, have a cup of coffee and go to work and start feeling the back pain. Sometimes it gets worse after eating. I also get this same pain across the shoulders at times  and today it's been my neck that is hurting more than anything. My neck has hurt a bit off and on the last few days. I have also had a mild burning sensation down my back, doesn't last long but has happened a few times since this started. By the end of last week, I was feeling a tingling sensation down my right arm. On Sunday I felt it on the left side of my face, it start and then go away and come back a few minutes later. That lasted until yesterday. It's gone today. Yesterday both arms felt tingly. Tonight it feels like it's in my lower right leg. I have also had heart palpitations a few times. TMI, another symptom since this started is when I have a bowl movement, they are gassy (as in a lot of farts come out lol). Also at times one or both of my arms has felt week--physically they work just fine, no issues lifting or using my arms but it's a feeling of weakness if that makes sense. I also had hot flashes the first week this began. 

Today the pain has been in my neck just above my shoulders and no tingling until late this afternoon in my right leg. For the last few days, the back pain has been in the middle of my back. 

Ok I also just realized another symptom I overlooked-over the last couple months, I have had painful gas at night, enough times that it's unusual. Chalked it up to snacking before bed and laying down to go to sleep with food digesting. Am now wondering if it was another sign my gallbladder had a problem.

I think this may also be related, a year ago December, I got a random pain in my lower right shoulder after I swallowed a very large vitamin C pill. (ester C brand. Huge pill). It lasted a few days and it was a mild stabbing pain that came and went every few minutes. I felt this pain again toward the end of 2024, think it lasted a couple days.  I took the Ester C one other time in 2024 and also experienced the same pain shortly after. 

I have an appointment with a physicians assistant tomorrow. Cannot be seen by a doctor because in this country (USA), you get punished for being healthy. I made the mistake of not getting my annual exams and not getting sick enough to need a doctor (until now). So I am now considered a new patient and nobody at my doctor's office has an opening for a new patient until May. (It could be worse, the practice my husband goes to, they aren't seeing new patients until October!). Anyway, a PA at my doctors office can see me tomorrow. 

I guess I am looking to see if anyone else had these symptoms and was it an inflamed gall bladder? Or gall stones? At this point, if it's my gallbladder I just want the damn thing taken out. Are there any signs I should look for here? I don't want to end up in the ER. Is this a gallbladder attack or is it just sludge? ",1,1737688367.0,gallbladders,2,1.0,False

Before you read my story, here's a little bit about me. I'm a male in my 20's who is going through a barbaric GI episode and trying to find answers to my problems.

In the first week of September, I noticed a change in my bowel movements. I'd have this random feeling to go to the bathroom out of the blue without even eating anything. The frequent bowel movements usually started after my morning breakfast and no matter how many times I pass my stools, I'd feel incomplete like I'd still have to be back after a while. I also noticed small amounts of mucus every now and then but it didn't concern me much.

While this continued, one day I noticed a small amount of blood (could say less than 2 drops) in my stool. I did not have any other issues like constipation or pain. Went to a GI doctor for the same and was told not to worry about it as he said that it could have been due to anal fissures or hemorrhoids. Gave me some meds and did not see blood or mucus until I was consuming them. Once the meds were over, the frequent bowel movements and mucus-y stools started.

Again went to the doc and he ordered blood and stool tests. The blood tests came back with slightly elevated levels of Eosinophils, Amylase, Aspartate aminotransferase(40.95) & Alanine aminotransferase (59.30) whereas the stool test indicated the presence of bacteria. Was put on a different round of meds again. This time my symptoms worsened and started experiencing foul smelling semi-solid stools pretty much every single time I had to poop. God I wish I could describe how awful the smell was. I still noticed mucus just like before. I really wanted to resist the feeling of having to poop because of the horrendous smell but I couldn't help it. I gotta say that at this point I forgot how normal poop would look/smell like because it was semi-solid with an awful smell every time.

The meds did not work for me this time as my problems still continued to persist. I told the doc that this isn't working out and he suggested to take stool culture test as my initial stool test showed the presence of bacteria and endoscopy. The stool culture test came back normal with the comment ""Normal flora growth and no enteric pathogens like Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., and Vibrio sp. were isolated"". The endoscopy came back with ""Mild Antral Gastritis. LAX LES / Hiatus Hernia"". The doc said that he was clueless as to why this is happening to me. He suggested to continue the meds but at this point I was so frustrated because the meds weren't working for me.¬†

I stopped the meds for a week and I again noticed blood covered in the mucus of my stool again. I panicked and I decided to get a second opinion from another GI doctor.

Went to this new GI doc in October. Explained everything to the new doc and I was asked to recall the list of all foods that I ate in the last couple of days. He asked me whether the frequent bowel movements/mucus in stool started after eating certain foods that contain gluten or diary because the foods I ate the previous day did contain a lot of gluten. As for diary, I'd drink coffee only when I feel like I want to. He suggested that I might be gluten/lactose intolerant and asked me to experiment with these two. He asked me to stop consuming gluten/diary to see if my bowel movements improved. As a matter of fact, it did improve for like a week. If I have to put a number, I'd say probably like a 40%. The smell of my poop didn't change much but the frequency of my bowel movements somewhat improved.¬†

He asked me to carry on this gluten/lactose free diet for 2 weeks but he said that I'd still have to get a colonoscopy in order to rule out the possibilities of polyps and hemorrhoids. Suggested to get my blood tested for deficiencies as the previous one didn't test for it. The tests came back with a moderate Vitamin D deficiency and I was given supplements for the same. At this point, the vitamin supplements were the only meds I was taking besides following a GF/LF diet.

After going through the horrible phase of prepping for colonoscopy, I finally got it done. Guess what. The tests came back squeaky clean with no polyps or hemorrhoids. But for 3 days after my colonoscopy,¬† I truly felt better as I passed normal smelling stools without mucus. The frequency of bowel movements drastically reduced from what it used to be and I was over the moon that things have finally settled. But I was wrong. Though I didn‚Äôt poop much often, I again noticed blood covered in mucus.

My doc was as confused and clueless as me. Suggested to take IgE and food allergy test. The IgE test came back with elevated levels (454 IU/mL) and the food allergy test came back normal citing that I had no allergies towards any food. My doctor is not aware of this test result yet as my appointment isn‚Äôt until next week.

I‚Äôm still following a GF/LF diet as of today since October so if I‚Äôm allergic/intolerant then I should feel much better when I don‚Äôt consume them. But staying GF & DF isn't helping me either. I no longer see blood in stools but the foul smell and mucus have random patterns. 

I really don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with me and I‚Äôd appreciate if someone could offer some guidance. Thanks for giving this a read.

I'm currently just doing the best I can with what I got, aspire to be the best version of myself everyday, and hoping to be more that that and rise out of my current situation in the future. 

I work in logistics and spend a lot of time traveling between NY and NJ. I don't spend a lot of time with loved ones (this includes a girlfriend and family) due to working so much. It doesn't help that I'm an introvert, so it'll take me a minute to open up fully if you're up for that. 

My hobbies include gaming, music, coffee, working out, history and pop culture. I'm currently trying to learn programming, so if you got any tips, let me know. I also like learning about life in other places, places I hope to travel to like Toronto, London, and Tokyo.

Starting off, I'm looking for people to chat with throughout the day and get to know over time.

A little about me: I am 37 and married. Not a deal breaker, but my preference is connecting with other married guys. I‚Äôm into outdoorsy stuff like camping and hiking. Also typically workout 4-5 times per week. I typically will go for a run 2-3x a week and lift the other days. Into college sports, especially basketball. Into computer coding (web design/Laravel) as a hobby. Working to build a website I hope to turn into a business one day. I am also interested in entrepreneurship in general. Live on coffee. Enjoy cooking on occasion, traveling, curating playlists, listening to audiobooks, and breakfast food in general. I don't unfriend people over politics, but I am certainly on the liberal side of things. I tend to keep my political views to myself, but open to having a healthy discussion about them if you want.

When I asked permission from my landlord to install a gazebo, her ask was that it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúblock anybody‚Äôs view‚Äù (of the strip). I have two neighbors, one on either side. Neighbors 1 are very cool, have never complained about anything ever. I ensured I didn‚Äôt block their strip view. Neighbors 2 are not cool and they complain about everything all of the time, eg: my teenage son having friends over playing football in the backyard, they even have cameras pointing straight into my back and front yards. I felt uncomfortable and installed the gazebo in their camera view, but not blocking their strip view. She asked me to take it down or move it because it is blocking the view of the sunrise which apparently she watches every morning while sipping her coffee (I never noticed this before). 

Facts: 1) It is in fact blocking her mountains and sunrise view. 2) I have been being harassed by a neighbor, ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù with multiple calls to the police claiming false statements including but not limited to trafficking children and neglecting my own, thus demeaning my character. Per the PD, it‚Äôs enough to suggest harassment. I am not sure if it‚Äôs them; they are the only ones I‚Äôve had issues with. 3) She has an upstairs patio she can very easily watch the sunrise from instead of asking me to remove my peace and happiness from my own yard. 4) they have lived here much longer than I have and yes, I am only a tenant vs them being homeowners. 5) We live in an HOA community; this is not a 55 and older community
 6) If I move it, it could obstruct the strip view of Neighbors 1. 7) I am a single mom, I can‚Äôt even move it myself if I wanted to, and my kids are hated by them so they‚Äôre not trying to do the neighbors any favors.

Let me preface and say I know that full time or part time working can be difficult especially with multiple jobs and with constant interactions with strangers it is draining asf. And as a student too.. I obviously dont know what this woman deals with on a daily basis and what is going on her life. Nor does she with mine.¬†Life is hard. Life deals you with all kinds of shit. Life is like that. But I put up with it and still know how to act respectfully. It's part of the job and part of life. 

So tell me why she has to bring her attitude in when taking orders and god forbid you take longer than 5 seconds to complete your order she will sigh like you inconvenienced the rest of her life. All I ask is to scan my points. But hey I get it. I shouldn't have asked. I shouldn't have even lined up in the first place. I was in the wrong for being a customer asking a simple request. Next time I'll just skip my breakfast or lunch that day. Seriously, I get it you just want to get through the same shift every day hopefully without any trouble that may cause a delay. I apologize for being the dumbass that caused that momentary delay that day. So I ignore her attitude and move on. Like always. Tbh I've heard the same impatient sigh from my parents so many times that shit sucks. Why do people feel the need to express out loud their frustration so passive-aggressive like that? We could all use a lot of patience. Customer and employee. Is it too much to ask for a polite interaction so we can both move on without feeling shitty? Is it reallllllllllly that hard? I literally hope she is not the one taking my order when I wait in line. I get anxiety about it. I usually have the time to wait in line so I never use mobile orders. Plus my order is usually short so the wait time for my order isn't bad. I'm patient. So I hate that I'm considering it now just to avoid a particular employee. 

At first I thought I was the only one receiving her bad end but another thing I noticed with this employee is that as I'm waiting the odd 20min for my order I'll notice that her interactions with young students are so passive-aggressive while older people in general are treated with A SMILE. SHE EVEN JOKES AND LAUGHS WITH THEM. I was seriously taken aback with her change in behavior. They were possibly regulars and/or maybe knew her personally? Oh ok sorry we don't know each other personally on a deeper level next time we can share our deepest traumas to understand each other better. Maybe we'll become nicer and patient. I'm sorry if you had a bad experience in uni but maybe don't project your bad feelings onto 1st years or even international students. 

One time as I was waiting I noticed a student who looked to be an international student (they had a canadian flag and name tag on their backpack. I've only ever seen a few international students with stuff like that) taking a while and they were possibly struggling with their order but since I had my headphones on I couldn't fully hear the exchange. I don't know what the woman said to this student but it was definitely full of her usual attitude. It looked like she was glaring the whole time. I know she desperately wanted to roll her eyes like I feel when its with me. When the student turned around they honestly looked upset and confused. Like damn. Learning english must be hard enough. Practicing must be even tougher. I felt so bad.

I've been very bothered by this. I''ve prob gone insane for reading so much into a short interaction (although on multiple occasions) for a coffee and maybe food. But this isn't something that peope should be forced to put up with repeatedly? Am I wrong to think this?? 

Shout out to the sweet asian lady I think shes possibly filipino, she is patient with your order and does not make a fuss about issues that take 3 seconds to fix, no attitude no glaring. Bless her soul.

We walk whenever I feel up to it and often stop at nearby parks or coffee shops as breaks.

For some context, I am really scared of pitbull dogs. I know they can be sweet, but ever since I was bitten by one I like to stay away from them. It may sound like I'm being petty, but I really don't want to pet or be around those dogs anytime soon. Nothing against the owners because most of them listen to me when I tell them that I'm scared.

Me, my dad, and my service dog were out walking when we heard the jingle of a dog's collar. I asked my dad what dog this was (I am visually impaired) and he said he didn't know. We got a few feet away and I realized it was a pit bull. We crossed the street and I thought nothing more of it. I know crossing the road to avoid a dog sounds mean, but I don't want the dog to get excited and jump or bark at me or  I accidentally startle the dog. The owner was clearly not happy about this and crossed to the other side with us. He got really mad and said some things about ""breed discrimination"" and tried to force his dog upon us. By now the dog was jumping up on both my dad and me and my dog was off to the side about a foot away just chilling. The pitbull was kissing my face and clawing at my shirt so much that it hurt, and I had asked the owner to stop the dog multiple times. The dog knocking me over was the last straw. Eventually, I shoved the dog off lightly as not to hurt it and the guy went ballistic. I barely touched the dog and it landed on it's feet and didn't whine or anything. He said he was going to report us for assaulting his dog. There are security cameras near the sidewalk so im not worried. I also have scratches from the dog as evidence. So AITAH? Should I have walked past and hoped for the best? I love dogs even the pit bulls (a little bit) and I dont want to hurt them.

It cannot be said often enough that hoarding behaviors do not exist in isolation. They are accompanied by mental illness, cognitive impairment, neurodivergence, physical illness, injury, trauma, etc. Pair that with the idea that ""like goes with like"" and when hoarder parents take in a hoarder guest...

I know that I am comparatively lucky. The house remained habitable. The guest didn't do extensive damage and didn't steal anything. The situation involved a guest who had no tenant rights. I know I'm lucky, yet...

It's going to take a while to undo the grime, neglect, and ""shit that just doesn't make sense no matter how you look at it.""

We need to call an electrician. We needed to call an electrician when I started staying here in August, but the guest--who purports to having experience in electrical work and electronics--talked Dad out of hiring one. He executed a DIY electrical repair which has now failed completely.

He didn't get everything out of the house, which he no longer has access to. I'm not letting him back in to get it.

He has things in several outbuildings and in various locations on the property. Provided he lets Dad know when he's coming, he can come back for his stuff. Anything he hauls away is a plus. I don't want him on the property unless someone is here because it is clear that he's been churning while he's here.

He removed all his stuff from the guest bedroom, for which I'm grateful. I am going to move out of my parents' room--where everything is full of their stuff--into the guest bedroom. Although he removed all of his things, the room is filthy. It hasn't been vacuumed or dusted the entire time he's stayed here (I'm not sure how long that was, but I do know it was over 5 years). It's going to take me a day to clean it, and right now I don't have a day. I'm going to make one, but it'll cost me.

I went through 1 cupboard here and used those items to replace worn-out counterparts at my parents' retirement property. Dad wanted to know what I was going to do with the worn-out items; I told him simply, ""I'll find a place."" They went in the Toter.

I purged 3 more cupboards here and pulled enough kitchenware to donate 3 plastic grocery bags and one decent sized Amazon box last weekend. I stopped counting at 29 coffee mugs and found more. I could safely get rid of 5. I stored a dozen, to make the cupboard usable.

As soon as a shelf, cupboard, or drawer is cleared, it's too easy to re-arrange the remaining items to make it look ""full"" again. Half the stuff is gone, yet the shelf still looks full.

Meanwhile them, pa-graduate palang. Hintay nalang ng requirements and soon, graduation na rin nila. Ganun pa rin sila, carefree and palamura pa din. Hyper and alive.

I'm open to different ages and would love a chance for us to get a coffee, go for a walk, have deeper listening conversations with each other.

If you're interested in hanging out, please feel free to send me a DM to tell me a bit about yourself or leave a comment here.

I appreciate you for reading this. Enjoy the rest of your week! ",5,1737686965.0,BrisbaneSocial,1,1.0,False
1i8le9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i8le9x/i_had_to_cancel_plans_with_my_friend_due_to_work/,I had to cancel plans with my friend due to work and I think they're pretty upset with me. How can I smooth this over?,"I need some advice on how to handle a situation with a friend. Mind you, the situation might sound painfully simple, but I'm not the greatest with confrontation and I'd appreciate the objective perspectives.

My friend (good friends of 10+ years) had asked me last Thursday to get together this Monday evening after work. I was excited and agreed to hanging out. On Sunday evening, I checked my work email as there's been a lot going on at work lately (I was off Friday, and accepted a new job offer on Thursday), at which point I saw that I had some meetings added to my calendar late on Monday that would make it hard to hang out with my friend. Since I just got a new job (same company), I knew I unfortunately needed to prioritize work, so I immediately texted my friend, explained the situation, apologized and asked if we can reschedule to another evening this week. In the morning, I got an upset text back from my friend saying that this is the third time I've bailed the day of. I responded apologizing again, and this time explained that I'm realizing it's tough for me to hang out on week nights, specifically when we're going to have ""art night"" (this requires a lot of preparation from my part, but not from hers as she works as a full time artist, so her schedule is more flexible). I said I would love to have an art night, but I think realistically a Friday night, Saturday or Sunday would work better. My friend sent me a text back saying that it's hard to want to plan art nights if it's such an easy thing for me to bail on.

I guess this is the part where I feel frustrated. I work a demanding job with long hours, and my friend is aware of this. I've had to cancel in the past due to work, but I always make good on my word and reschedule to a week or so later. I also have hung out with her a bunch, getting coffee a couple weeks ago, hosting an art show together in December, having multiple art nights over the fall, and even asking her this past Friday if she wanted to go out bowling together (she wasn't able to make it), so it's clear I value her friendship. I feel misunderstood and a little hurt because I tried explaining genuinely my situation and I thought her response was a little cold. What would you do if you were me? Any suggestions on how to smooth the situation over? I think my #1 learning here is to not commit to social events during the work week that fall outside of ""easy peasy"" things to do (like getting dinner or going to the gym together), since it's hard for me to balance. Thank you in advance for your help.

Edit: When she said this is the third time I've bailed, she was referencing the past 4 months (basically the fall) where I had to reschedule twice (once due to work, and once being sick). However, I only canceled the day of when I was sick, the other instance I let her know sooner.",1,1737686746.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

My last calprotectin was high at 1,300 (this was mid-way through my current flare-up).

I haven't modified my diet much or taken supplements. Well, I have cut out coffee, dairy (have dairy allergy so that was already part of my diet), fizzy water and alcohol.  My doctor wants me to go on Entyvio but I'm still feeling like there should be other options before I try biologics.

Chapter I
Background
     
Fuego, Agua, Viento, Tierra, and Centi. The Quintet of Imperium. They controlled the five elements: Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, and Zenith. 
     Each one of the five Quintets controlled over one of these elements and each element roamed inside a region. 
     The Sangre is where the unloyal go and is controlled by Centi. 
     Centi acts as the leader of the Quintet and is led by Sabre. She along with Ashbel (Fuego), Calder (Agua), Nephel  (Viento), and Hanako (Tierra) lead Achos.
Chapter II
Trapdoor

     ‚ÄúSabre, I beg of you,‚Äù said the cloaked man, ‚Äúgive me more time to pay my dues.‚Äù He clasped his hands together. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt leave my family and be sent to the Sangre.‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôve given you more time, the most time. Around three months and yet you still owe me 50,300 Notches,‚Äù she paused, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs too late.‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúNo! Sabre plea-‚Äù suddenly the floor collapsed beneath the man and he fell down the trapdoor. 
      Sabre released the lever she pulled and the floor went back to normal. She pinched her nose and sighed.
     *Too many people and so little space for them, I might need to expand the Sangre soon‚Ä¶* Sabre thought. She opened up her drawer and looked at that stone tablet she found years ago. 

Five bleeds, Four crushed, Three betrayed, 
Two falls, One becomes nothing

     Engraved in blood, these words were on the stone. She tried destroying the stone, smashing it, burning it, exploding it, but nothing worked. She ultimately decided to keep it, no one else must see.
     Just then the phone on her desk rang. She picked it up. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúGreetings Sabre,‚Äù Calders smooth voice sang, ‚ÄúDid you deal with number 32,571?‚Äù 
     Sabre sighed, ‚Äúyes, it‚Äôs such a shame to lose those Notches but people must learn I suppose.‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôll put it in the database. How much did he owe again?‚Äù 
     Sabre pretended she didn‚Äôt know the exact amount and after a few moments said ‚Äú50,300 Notches. Or, to be more precise, 50 Duoches and 300 Notches.‚Äù 
     Calder typed it in, ‚Äúok thank you Sabre. See you later.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúGoodbye.‚Äù She set down the phone. 
     *Five, Four, Three, Two‚Ä¶* she stopped herself.











Chapter III
Blue to Red
     
     The girl had run, farther and faster than she ever had before. She swayed off the path and snuck in the forest. She loved the smell of the trees and the chatter of the animals.
     Though she never could enjoy it long enough. 
     Most of the time, usually within 10 minutes, she got caught by one of the ‚ÄòPrime Guards‚Äô who would beat her and return her home. But the pain was worth it.
     She took out her carving knife and continued her work on the tree she was previously carving. She was making a bird though she didn‚Äôt know exactly what kind. 
     She had seen it last time. Its indigo feathers lit up the sky. She remembered what it looked like, but she wouldn‚Äôt get to see it again. Not after what happened last time she was here. 
     
     - She didn‚Äôt even know what a gun was. But as she was carving, she suddenly noticed a loud bang that shook the earth. The bird's feathers turned from blue to red as it fell to the ground and twiched there.
    ‚ÄúWhat are you doing out here!?‚Äù The Prime Guard yelled with a smoky pistol in his hand, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already told you these are hunting woods!‚Äù He got out his baton.
     The pain from the injuries he gave her didn‚Äôt even compare to the pain she felt inside.
     Her father scolded her when he got home, ‚ÄúI told you! You have to stay out of that forest!‚Äù Then, after she told him about that bird, ‚Äúwhat if next time he decides to shoot you? What would your mother do without her daughter? What would I do?‚Ä¶I‚Äôm worried about you Dee, you can‚Äôt just keep disobeying them.‚Äù 
     She didn‚Äôt care, she didn‚Äôt care, she didn‚Äôt care. -
     
     She had almost finished her carving. She had to make it perfect, every feather, every talon, everything. Her hands were blistered and bruised but it didn‚Äôt bother her. 
     She was surprised nobody caught her, it was very late at night.
     With one last cut she had done it. She had finished carving that beautiful, indigo bird. Yet the pain she felt didn‚Äôt go, she didn‚Äôt feel happier, that pit in her stomach didn‚Äôt leave. 
     She started to cry. The tears poured on to the ground. Why? It‚Äôs not fair! She placed her hands on the carving, she missed the bird, blue covered by red. The way it knew. Its soulful chirp.
     Suddenly she felt a breeze, a very strange breeze. She looked up, her bird carving was glowing! The wind got stronger, it picked her up and carried her into the sky. 
    She soared above the clouds. She felt happy for the first time in days. The stars glowed brighter than ever. Then suddenly she felt something nestle into her hand. 
     There the indigo bird slept, it was no longer covered in red. It looked like it was at peace. Though she saw and felt it, the bird was completely weightless. Like it had already moved on. 
     Once she descended from the clouds she peeked inside her hands. The bird was gone, but a strange symbol was etched into her right palm.

     *I‚Äôll miss you‚Ä¶* she had to think of a name for the bird, *I‚Äôll miss you‚Ä¶Nephel .*





Chapter IV
Crystallize

     Sabre marched through the hall, marching was something her father told her symbolizes power.
     A rabbit was running towards her. She stopped.
     ‚ÄúSabre, Achos would like to meet with you at 10:30 PM at the Repurposing Center!‚Äù The rabbit spoke. 
     ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôll be there,‚Äù Sabre replied. The rabbit hopped away. Then, Sabre looked at her watch, *I‚Äôve got around 3 minutes, maybe I still have time for a coffee.*
     Sabre tapped her palm, instantly a thermos filled with coffee appeared. She grabbed it. 
     She tapped her palm again, ‚Äútake me to the Repurp-‚Äù Suddenly the world around her became dark. Thousands of voices screamed around her. *Justice, Justice, Justice!*
     ‚ÄúFive, Four, ‚Ä¶Two, One,‚Äù a voice whispered behind her. A piercing pain came from her back. Then again, except it was on her shoulder. This continued in different places until Sabre blacked out.
     Medics rushed to her after a few minutes. She had been stabbed 5 times and had major blood loss. Strangely, the areas which she had been stabbed had formed the points of a star.
     ‚ÄúI shall take her place while she is recovering. We, of course, have no reign over the elements while she is down so get the best doctors to heal her as soon as possible,‚Äù Ashbel commanded, ‚ÄúNephel and Calder, you will keep control of the Sangre, and Hanako, you will supervise Sabre and protect her.‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Hanako said, ‚ÄúI will take her back to Tierra with me and try to create something to heal her wounds.‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúNephel and I will go to the Sangre and watch over the Unloyals,‚Äù Calder assured. Nephel took out a piece of paper and wrote: Calder could take the Sangre by Agua and I can take the ones by Viento and Centi. 
     ‚ÄúNo need to take the one by Agua, a few weeks ago Sabre had me‚Ä¶crystallize it,‚Äù Ashbel remembered.
     Hanako was stunned, ‚Äú‚Ä¶there were at least 450 people living there and you-‚Äú she shook, ‚ÄúSabre just had you kill them‚Ä¶‚Äù
     ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm not entirely sure they‚Äôre dead, but they are completely covered in crystals. Besides they were just Unloyals,‚Äù Ashbel spouted.
     ‚ÄúJust Unloyals?! Those were human lives! But she just-‚Äú 
     ‚ÄúShut up! She might be able to hear you, and if she does you‚Äôll be‚Ä¶‚Äù Calder couldn‚Äôt even finish. He had already seen it happen to the previous Nephel. He was asking too many questions, questions he shouldn‚Äôt have been asking. Then suddenly he was just‚Ä¶gone. Then Sabre removed the ‚Äònew‚Äô Nephels vocal chords. 
     ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care at this point! We have to-‚Äú 
     ‚ÄúHave to what.‚Äù Sabre's right palm was glowing, she was using all of her strength to pull herself up. ‚ÄúGo on, tell me what you have to do.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúWe-we‚Ä¶we have to get rid of you! All you do is kill and kill! These are precious lives! When you first made Achos, all the people living on this land you just-‚Äú Hanako yelled, ‚Äúkilled them all!‚Äù
     Suddenly Hanako‚Äôs throat was glowing green and she suddenly dropped to the ground. Her eyes went from green to gray as the life she had faded from her. With the power that Sabre gained from Hanako, she instantly healed herself and her stab wounds closed. 
     ‚Äú(Huff, huff) anyone else want to spread lies?‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúNo of course not Sabre,‚Äù Ashbel quickly said.
     ‚ÄúGood, I‚Äôm too tired to make another #3,‚Äù Sabre yawned. 
     ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you mean‚Ä¶Hanako?‚Äù Ashbel asked. Instead of responding, Sabre tapped her palm once more and disappeared. 

Five bleeds, four crushed, 
two falls, one becomes nothing
Chapter V
Ouroboros

     She put another log on the fire. It roared with appreciation. She liked the warm, comforting glow of the flame. 
     Suddenly her mother called, ‚ÄúDee! Come help your brother chop wood for the fire!‚Äù She sighed, as much as she liked the fire she hated chopping wood at least 5 times more. It was so tiring and straining. 
     She grabbed her fathers bright red axe and headed downstairs. 
     Her mother spotted her with the axe. ‚ÄúWoah, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt be using your fathers axe‚Ä¶well he won‚Äôt be home for another hour or so,‚Äù her mother said, ‚Äúyou have to be quick, but go ahead.‚Äù
     A couple of minutes later her and her brother were deep in the woods. She would chop and her brother would collect. 
     ‚ÄúHey, betcha I can start a fire without a match,‚Äù her brother proposed. 
     She thought he was wrong. They made a deal, if he did it then she would have to do his chores for a week and if he didn‚Äôt then it would be him doing hers.
     ‚ÄúShake on it?‚Äù Her brother asked. She nodded so they did. 
     He started by carving a stick into a fine point with the axe. He then carved the top layers of a log. 
     ‚ÄúNow if I take the stick between my palms and start spinning it really quickly then a fire should start.‚Äù
     He started and a small hole was drilled, then smoke started coming out and eventually‚Ä¶
     ‚ÄúDone! See, I told ya I could do it!‚Äù The fire started to get bigger and bigger.
      No! He had to have cheated, he must have used a match or something while she wasn‚Äôt looking! 
     The fire was even bigger, it ate the wood they had been collecting. The heat was starting to hurt her skin and her eyes.
     ‚ÄúDelilah? Why do you look so mad?‚Äù Her brother asked. The fire looked hungrier, it needed more. The fire wasn't just satisfied with just the wood. It needed something bigger.
     ‚ÄúDee?‚Äù
     She shoved her brother into the flames. She knew she shouldn‚Äôt have. Why did she? Why? 
     It was a blur. She started to run, the fire was engulfing all the surrounding trees. Her brother screamed for help. Begged for help. Then all too suddenly the screams stopped.
     She rubbed the ash on her hands onto her shirt, and wiped the blood off of her mind.
     She knew she could never return home, what would her parents think? She looked at her shaking hands. On one, there was her gift from Nephel. Now, on the other hand there was a new symbol.

     What did these strange symbols mean? She rubbed her palm but the new ashy symbol stayed. She then tapped her palm. 
     A tingling sensation shot down her arm. Almost instantly, a blaze of fire shot out of her hand. It landed on a nearby grass patch and exploded, destroying the surroundings.
    She looked surprised, what was that? She then saw this symbol in a whole new light. She could fix her problem.
    She started walking towards her house.
Chapter VI
Controlled

     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late,‚Äù a voice called from the corner.
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I was attacked by them again,‚Äù Sabre explained, ‚ÄúI had to‚Ä¶take care of Hanako to heal myself. Besides she was-‚Äú
     ‚ÄúI already know. Do not be late again. When I command something you must listen.‚Äù
      ‚ÄúAchos I‚Äôm sorry but-‚Äú 
      ‚ÄúShut your mouth, I don‚Äôt care for your excuses. If you want to maintain reign over the elements you must obey.‚Äù The shadow came out of the corner. An exact look alike of Sabre stood there. A gleaming black knife was in the doppelg√§ngers hand. ‚ÄúUnderstood?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù Achos looked at Sabre with a deathly stare. Achos put the handle of the knife to Sabre. She took it. ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do now?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúI need you to kill #2 with this knife, he is no use to me anymore.‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúNephel, No please! I already had to reconstruct him. His screams of agony still fill my head. He does not deserve this pain.‚Äù Sabre pleaded.
      ‚ÄúObey. #2 must die with that exact knife. You will stab him in the chest and then return the knife to me,‚Äù Achos paused, ‚ÄúUnderstood?‚Äù
      Sabre nodded.
      She hid the knife in her back pocket and Achos disappeared back into the shadows.
     Sabre‚Äôs head was spinning, why was Achos making her do these horrible things? First killing Hanako and now this.
     *She might be able to hear you!* Calder's voice echoed in her mind. They did not respect her, they were not loyal, they were afraid.
     The knife in her pocket weighed so much more than it did.




Chapter VII
Hat Trick

     There was no way she could kill Nephel. But if she didn‚Äôt then they were all dead. 
     She went back into her home. The only place where Achos didn‚Äôt have eyes. She took the knife and set it on the table. 
     ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs with the knife?‚Äù A familiar voice echoed.
     ‚ÄúHanako?‚Äù Sabre asked, ‚Äúit couldn‚Äôt be‚Ä¶‚Äù She looked all around and couldn‚Äôt find the source of the voice. 
     ‚ÄúYou're not planning to harm another life are you?‚Äù Hanako's voice rang.
     ‚ÄúWhere are you!?‚Äù Suddenly a green light hit Sabre's eyes. It was coming from her palm. ‚ÄúAre you inside my hand?‚Äù
     Suddenly the green light shot out of her hand and flew out her window. Immediately, Sabre felt herself weaken. She fell to her knees. 
     ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶happened?‚Äù She laid on the ground for a second, then she slowly stood up.
     ‚ÄúFive, Four, One,‚Äù the voice in her head said. 
     ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù Hanako's voice screamed.
     Sabre‚Äôs hands smashed on the ground against her will, underneath plants and roots sprouted. They started to form the shape of a human.
     ‚ÄúThree, three, three.‚Äù 
      The green light shot back into the house and flew into the plants. The humanoid shape of the plants was suddenly fully there. Even grassy hair sprouted from the things head. 
     ‚ÄúI am Lily. Spirit of Earth and protector of life,‚Äù the plant spoke. 
     ‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù Sabre said, surprised, ‚ÄúSpirit of Earth?!‚Äù *But Hanako was the one who had reign over Tierra!*
     ‚ÄúShe was simply a vessel for me, I am the embodiment of earth and life.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúYou can see my thoughts?!‚Äù Sabre was freaked out. Her mind was scrambled. ‚ÄúDoes Achos know about you?‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúNo she does not and it will stay that way,‚Äù Lily assured her. She grabbed the black knife off of the table, ‚ÄúI did not know Achos kept this after all these years.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúThe knife? What do you mean ‚Äòafter all these years‚Äô?‚Äù Sabre asked. 
      ‚ÄúThis is the knife she used to kill me.‚Äù


Chapter VIII
Flow

     She looked at the ashy remains of her house. Tears spilt down her face. Her whole family is gone now, all because of her.
     Fire was destructive.
     A slightly burnt photo flew into her hand. Her and her brother were swimming in the nearby pond. She slightly tapped her palm and turned the photo into ashes.
     The pond would be a nice escape from everything. 
    She started hiking towards it, it was only a mile away and it wouldn‚Äôt take her too long. 
     Little did she know, she was followed. Behind her the scrape of a blade went against the leaves on the ground and the footsteps shook the earth. 
    After a while she was almost there. The air around her was more humid than ever. The ground became more muddy.
     The man following her had almost caught up. The bright red axe in his hand dragged against the leaves. He would try until death. He would try. 
     She was walking until she suddenly tripped over something. The man took it as an opportunity to strike, he brought his axe over his head and swung.
     Before she was cut she swiftly rolled to the side. The axe slammed into the ground. He started to pull it out. 
     She quickly got up and started running for the pond. Her heart was pounding. The man ripped the axe out of the earth and chased her.
     She tried to use her symbols to defend herself but they weren‚Äôt working. Whenever she tapped them it stung her hand. 
     He went for another swing and made a long slash across her back. She yelled in pain but kept running. At long last she had made it to the pond. She quickly dove into the pond to try to escape. But then she started drowning. She didn‚Äôt know how to swim
     Her attacker watched as she dove deeper and deeper down. She turned around to look at him. His face changed. From fury to fear. He quickly dove in after her.
     He grabbed her and brought her back to the surface. As she was coughing up water she suddenly realized who he was.
     Her father. 
     ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶no‚Ä¶no,‚Äù her father whispered, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre gone because of her. But I can‚Äôt do that to my own daughter.‚Äù
     Her father must have not been home when she lit their fire. He was not dead. 
     He dropped to his knees and started crying. He dropped his axe next to him. She quickly grabbed it. He didn‚Äôt even flinch. He just stayed there and kept crying. 
     
Her father was wood
She raised the axe up and swung.
His crying soon stopped.
     
     She pushed his body and watched as the water was stained red. She dipped her hand in the murky water and when she brought it back up a new symbol appeared.

     Was it worth it? 
     Water and blood were too much alike. 


Chapter IX
The Reality

     ‚ÄúShe killed you? But you're standing in front of me!‚Äù Sabre protested.
     ‚ÄúShe murdered me, I can‚Äôt tell you the details but it‚Äôs the truth.‚Äù Lily looked at the knife. She hadn‚Äôt been awake in forever.
     Just then Lily remembered something. She pointed the knife at Sabre, ‚ÄúYou had The Sangre crystallized! You killed thousands! Why would you do such an evil thing?‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never even been to The Sangre, I just managed it! I never crystallized it!‚Äù Sabres hands shot in the air.
     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not lying?‚Äù Lily said after reading Sabre's mind, ‚Äúbut Ashbel said you told him to crystallize it!‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúI would nev-‚Äú Sabre paused, ‚ÄúAchos did.‚Äù Achos must have pretended to be Sabre and told Ashbel to kill them, but why would she?
     ‚ÄúHer powers run on death, She must have needed those souls to keep her power strong.‚Äù Lily realized. She set the knife back on the table
     ‚ÄúHow do you know that? I didn‚Äôt even know that.‚Äù Sabre asked.
     ‚ÄúShe told me a long time ago. It doesn‚Äôt matter now. They‚Äôre already gone.‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no saving them‚Ä¶‚Äù Sabre was tricked, she was always tricked by Achos.
     ‚ÄúYou can still save us.‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúWhat do you mean by ‚Äòus‚Äô?‚Äù Sabre asked. Lily scratched familiar symbols into Sabres table. The elements: Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. Then in the middle the symbol on Sabre's palm was carved, Zenith.
     Lily pointed to the outer symbols. ‚ÄúThese are the natural elements.‚Äù She carved a name next to each symbol. Her own name under Earth, Ichor under Fire, Eva under Air, and Lou under Water. 
     ‚ÄúThese are the true masters of the elements, they are tethered to one another.‚Äù Lily said.
     ‚ÄúWhat about Zenith?‚Äù Sabre wondered.
     ‚Äú...I don't know,‚Äù Lily blurted quickly, ‚Äúwe all just called her ‚Äòmaster'‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúWell where is she now?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúI-‚Äù A loud knock at the door interrupted Lily's sentence. A negative presence haunted the door. Lily went into a houseplant as Sabre answered the door.
     Achos was there. ‚ÄúIs it done yet?‚Äù She asked in an impatient tone. Achos didn't like to wait.
     ‚ÄúUm not quite but I was about to-‚Äù
     ‚ÄúNo more excuses, I will give you another 30 minutes to do it before I take matters into my own hands,‚Äù Achos' voice commanded, ‚Äòunderstood?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù The knife suddenly appeared in Sabre's hands as soon as Achos shut the door. Sweat dripped down her forehead.
     ‚ÄúI have a plan,‚Äù Lily said as she stepped out from behind the plant, ‚Äúyou could pretend to kill him.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúThat could never work, Achos has eyes everywhere.‚Äù Sabre sighed.
     ‚ÄúNot here,‚Äù Lily realized, ‚ÄúIf you invited Nephel here you could pretend to kill him. That would also give you a chance to explain the situation to him.‚Äù
     Sabre thought for a moment then nodded.
     She called Nephel.











Chapter X
Hidden Garden

     She was starving. After her father died her powers worked again for a little while. She had access to clean water and a fire, but no food. She had to live off of things she found in Hichelberry Woods. 
     She used fire to kill squirrels and birds and cooked them over a fire. She didn‚Äôt catch even close to enough to have enough to eat though. She was the thinnest that she had ever been. 
     If only she knew how to get to town.
     She laid on the ground and closed her eyes. The empty groans from her stomach were too much. Her hands were in so much pain. 
     It was over‚Ä¶
     ‚ÄúHi there!‚Äù Her eyes jolted open. A girl around her age was standing above her. She was wearing clothes made from plants and wood.
     Was this real?
     ‚ÄúYou look hungry, do you want some food?‚Äù The girl asked. She nodded slowly. The plant girl tapped her palm and all around them bushes of berries grew. The girl took out a basket and started picking them. 
     ‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶are you?‚Äù She asked. It was the first words she had spoken in a long time.
     The girl stopped picking and said, ‚Äúmy name's Lilith, but you can call me Lily! I live in this forest,‚Äù Lily handed the basket to her, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Delilah,‚Äù she said as she scarfed down the berries.
     ‚ÄúWell what brings you to the forest Delilah?‚Äù Lily asked with a smile. 
     She hesitated to answer, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have anywhere else to go.‚Äù She finished the last of the berries and handed the basket back to Lily. She slowly got up. She somehow felt a lot better. 
     ‚ÄúI healed you! That‚Äôs why you feel better!‚Äù Lily exclaimed, ‚Äúif you have nowhere else to go why not live here with me? I‚Äôve never had a friend!‚Äù
     She was confused, how did she‚Ä¶‚ÄúYou can see my thoughts?‚Äù She asked. 
     ‚ÄúYeah, I guess. I didn‚Äôt even know I could do that!‚Äù  Lily held out a hand and she took it. Something with a wood like texture was on her palm. 
     ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù She asked. 
     ‚ÄúDunno, but when I use it I can make wonderful plants grow! Like the berries you ate just now!‚Äù Lily exclaimed. She turned around the palm and there was a similar symbol to hers, except it looked different.
     ‚ÄúWha-‚Äú
     ‚ÄúOh you have one too!‚Äù Lily smiled, ‚Äúwow three of them!‚Äù 
     Lily touched the symbols together and suddenly a burst of gray light flew from the center. It shot up in the air a couple feet before exploding into black and white. Afterwards they fizzled out.
     ‚ÄúWow did you see that! It was so cool!‚Äù 
    How did Lily get‚Ä¶
    ‚ÄúHere c‚Äômon! Let‚Äôs go to my house!‚Äù Lily pointed to a weird shack that she had never noticed before. Lily tugged on her hand. She nodded and they started walking.
    Her eyes wandered back to the sky, that‚Äôs when she saw a piercing black line fall from it. Whatever it was, it crashed into a nearby bush. 
     She stopped. ‚ÄúAre you coming?‚Äù Lily asked.
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôll catch up, I left something behind,‚Äù she replied. Lily shrugged and kept walking. 
     She peeked inside the bush, a glowing black knife pierced through the center. 
     She grabbed the handle, a surge of energy shot up from her arm.
     ‚ÄúThose who strive for perfection will always fall short, devoting yourself to this path will only bring death.‚Äù
      She ripped the knife from the center.
     ‚ÄúYou have been warned, to be perfect, to have it all, it is impossible,‚Äù the voice fizzled out.
Chapter XI
Memento Mori

     Nephel didn‚Äôt pick up. All Sabre could do was pray he understood her coded voice message.
     The clock was ticking down, she couldn‚Äôt do it here, not anymore.
     If Nephel got the message and if he was where she thought he was, it was possible to save him.
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to the graveyard,‚Äù Sabre told Lily. 
     ‚Äú15 minutes left, let‚Äôs pray that we are successful.‚Äù Sabre nodded and ran out the door. 

She thought this would work?
You can‚Äôt save anybody but yourself.
I will make sure she learns that.

     Please be here, please! She ran towards the place she thought he would be.
     Sabre hadn‚Äôt been here in a while, Nephel asked her for special permission to come here at least once a day.
     She made it to the gravestone. She started to tear up. 
     After Nephels wife passed, he broke. Accusing Sabre of things she would never have done. Then Achos forced her to‚Ä¶
     She never hoped, she never hoped it would turn out like this.

Charlie Kaji
November 13, 2304 - August 24, 2311
She is remembered by her Father, Nephel Kaji
and her Mother, Delilah Kaji who is watching over her in heaven
   
     Sabre's hands started to shake. Her ears started to ring and she fell to the ground.
     ‚ÄúNo! No! NO!‚Äù Sabre screamed.
     ‚ÄúSabre? Are you alright?‚Äù a familiar voice said behind her. She quickly turned around.
     ‚ÄúNephel! You know you shouldn't be talking, what if-‚Äù Sabre started.
     ‚ÄúAt this point‚Ä¶‚Äù he took a deep breath, ‚ÄúI don't care if Achos knows. What do I have to live for anyway? She already took away my wife and murdered my child.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúNephel I-‚Äù her hands started to grab for the knife.
     ‚ÄúDo it. Now,‚Äù the voice commanded.
     ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶NO NOT NOW!‚Äù Her hands were fastened around the grip.
     ‚ÄúObey.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúNephel RUN!‚Äù The knife cut through the air, missing Nephel by only a few inches. He scattered backwards. 
     ‚ÄúWh-It's Achos, isn't it?‚Äù Nephel paused, ‚Äúshe won't stop‚Ä¶‚Äù He looked back at Sabre, her eyes changed. No longer did they have any emotion. They didn‚Äôt see him, they saw through him.
     He dropped to the ground. ‚ÄúIf‚Ä¶if I must die, I would rather it be you that killed me rather than her.‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúNO! Please, run! If you make it to the border you could-‚Äú 
     ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶‚Äù tears spilled down his face, ‚ÄúI have nothing. I have no reason to live.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúYou have me! Please!‚Äù Sabre walked closer, knife in hand. Getting closer and closer to Nephel.
     He closed his eyes, ‚Äúpromise me‚Ä¶you will attempt to stop Achos, that‚Ä¶is all I wish for.‚Äù Sabre tried to resist, but it was no use. The knife was almost to his throat. 
     ‚ÄúPlease, run,‚Äù her voice was getting weaker, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt, I can‚Äôt do this‚Ä¶‚Äù 
Yes, yes you can
Someone once told me
That perfection is impossible
But
Only me
I alone 
I can achieve perfection
You and I
One
Chapter XII
Perfection

     ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre almost there!‚Äù Lily exclaimed. They had been walking for almost an hour now. She felt the knife in her back pocket.
     ‚ÄúPerfection‚Ä¶that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs about?‚Äù She said.
    ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Lily asked, ‚Äúwho cares about perfection?‚Äù 
    ‚ÄúOh, sorry. I was saying my thoughts out loud.‚Äù She looked at Lily's hand again. She needed it. She must be complete.
     No matter how much she complained Lily wouldn‚Äôt stop, though she was determined. If Lily fell asleep‚Ä¶
     ‚ÄúWe should rest here,‚Äù Lily suddenly said, ‚ÄúI'm pretty tired.‚Äù Lily plopped down on the ground and immediately started sleeping. 
     Perfect.
     She grabbed the knife, she needed to be complete. She looked over at that weird shack. Lily‚Äôs home. It looked the same distance away as when they started. Almost as if‚Ä¶
     Lily tapped her palm and vines sprouted from the ground. They grabbed her arms like handcuffs and tethered her to the ground.
     ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶Master told me to detain you,‚Äù she started, ‚Äúand looks like I did it just in time too.‚Äù Lily ripped the knife from her hand.
     ‚ÄúLet me go!‚Äù She screamed. 
     ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm sorry but I can‚Äôt,‚Äù Lily paused, ‚ÄúMaster told me to kill you. She saw that you were gonna do something terrible.‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúLily! Why would-‚Äú Lily suddenly tapped her palm again and a vine went over her mouth.
     ‚ÄúWhy would,‚Äù Lily started, ‚Äúyou try to kill me?‚Äù  Lily thrusted the knife into the ground and drew a strange circle around it. The knife started to fade.
     ‚ÄúHmm! Nnmm! MMMM!‚Äù her muffled voice said from behind the vine. She needed that knife! 
     ‚ÄúI-‚Äú Lily took a deep breath, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt kill you. No matter what I swore I would never kill anyone.‚Äù The knife was almost completely gone. ‚ÄúGoodbye‚Ä¶Delilah.‚Äù
     Lily started to walk away, she was just planning to leave her there until she starved to death. 
     With the last of her strength she ripped one of her hands free and used the hand to free her mouth. ‚ÄúLily! Please! I‚Äôm your friend!‚Äù
     Lily stopped walking.
     Yes! She cleared her mind. If Lily saw what she was thinking it would be over. 
     ‚ÄúFriend?‚Äù Lily looked back, ‚Äúmaybe‚Ä¶if you stayed with me in my shack‚Ä¶then I could keep a close eye on you.‚Äù The vines around her loosened and seeped back into the ground. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon‚Ä¶maybe I can explain all this to Master.‚Äù She smiled a trusting smile and started walking.
     Big mistake!
     ‚ÄúWhat big mista-‚Äú She grabbed the knife from the ground right before it completely disappeared and ran at Lily. She thrusted the knife into her stomach. 
     Lily dropped to the ground. 
     ‚ÄúI‚Äôve finally figured it out! My powers‚Ä¶they run on murder! After I killed my brother was when I first used them‚Ä¶then after father I could use them!‚Äù
     Blood poured out of Lily‚Äôs wound. ‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶this is all just a game to you isn‚Äôt it? Eva‚Ä¶she should have never trusted you with her gift. But, it‚Äôs too late now.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she said, stunned. Lily opened her mouth to speak but no words came out. Her eyes faded and her breathing slowed to a stop
     The symbol she was after appeared on her hand. She picked up Lily and carried her to the shack. 
     She dug a hole and buried her.


Chapter XIII
Behind Closed Doors

     She wanted to kill herself. There was no reason to live anymore.
     She was forced to kill everyone she loved. Her own daughter and now Nephel‚Ä¶she‚Äôs killed too many. There was only one reason she could think of to live. 
     Achos.
     She needed to die, she deserved to die. But it was futile. If she even got close to Achos with the intention to kill her, she would know.
     When she got back to her house Lily was scratching something on the table. It was a new symbol.

     ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù Lily said.
     Sabre‚Äôs hands were still shaking. ‚ÄúHe‚Ä¶he‚Äôs,‚Äù she sobbed. 
     ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù Lily whispered as she blew off the sawdust, ‚ÄúI felt it.‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúWill he come back? Like how you did after-‚Äú
     ‚ÄúNo. Eva, spirit of air, is completely dead. Nephel was the true controller of wind. Eva died long ago.‚Äù Sabre threw the knife on the table. 
     ‚ÄúAchos, I swear I will end her. She deserves to die,‚Äù Sabre cried. She took a closer look at the table, ‚Äúwhat are you making?‚Äù
     Lily grabbed the knife and carved a word underneath it ‚ÄòDUSK‚Äô. ‚ÄúThis is the lost element, the element of my father,‚Äù Lily cautiously said, ‚Äúif she ever found out about this, we are doomed. This is our only weapon against her.‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúHer powers use all the elements but this one. I only have Zenith and you only have Earth. I highly doubt we could convince Ashbel to join us and Calder doesn‚Äôt even trust me. How is one more element going to change our fight?‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see.‚Äù Lily grabbed Sabres left hand and laid it flat on the table. ‚ÄúNow stay still, I will use my powers so you won‚Äôt feel pain.‚Äù Lily picked up the knife again. 
     ‚ÄúOk,‚Äù Sabre whispered and closed her eyes.
Chapter XIV
Annihilation

   She still didn‚Äôt feel complete. She knew something was missing. 
      She went back to the vine prison that Lily created. She kneeled down and looked at that circle Lily drew on the ground. It was basically an exact replica of the circle on her hand except it had writing on the bottom.

 ~ Home ~

     She decided to try something. She scratched off home and replaced it with ‚ÄúHichelberry Town Square‚Äù.  Then she was about to tap it‚Ä¶
     ‚ÄúLilith? Can you hear me?‚Äù A voice said from something on the ground. She looked around and saw a strange device. 
     She cleared her throat and tried to sound like Lily, ‚ÄúYes I‚Äôm here.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúGood, I need you back home now. I felt a strange feeling, I assume you failed your mission?‚Äù the voice asked. This must be the ‚ÄòMaster‚Äô that Lily was talking about.
     ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm sorry Master.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúLilith I told you not to call me that! I am not your master, I am your mother! Now get home, it‚Äôs not safe out. Achos could kill you.‚Äù
     Her mother? ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Achos?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm calling that girl, she has been corrupted by the Achconians‚Äôs! They changed her. I thought that maybe, just mayb-‚Äù the voice suddenly cut off. Like something disrupted the connection‚Ä¶
     ‚ÄúHello? Hello!‚Äù She yelled, but to no response. She placed the device in her pocket. She needed to return ‚Äòhome‚Äô.
     She put home back on the circle and tapped it.
    Almost instantly a strange feeling filled her stomach. It felt like her cells were splitting and then reconstructing over and over. Her vision started to fade. She looked at the knife, hopefully she was ready for whatever was on the other side.
‚ÄúThis, this isn‚Äôt Lilith‚Ä¶‚Äù
Who am I hearing?
‚ÄúDear I believe this is the girl.‚Äù
‚ÄúAchos? No! I‚Äôll get the Zenithized cage.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy would she come to us?‚Äù
Because you have something I need
‚ÄúDid she just say..?‚Äù
I need‚Ä¶
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs waking up.‚Äù
     Her head jolted up. A woman was standing by her chaining her to a bed. 
     ‚ÄúWhat have you done with Lilith?‚Äù The woman asked. 
     ‚ÄúI did what I had to,‚Äù she replied, ‚Äúshe was going to leave me to starve to death‚Ä¶I assume you are the ‚Äòmaster‚Äô she was talking about huh?‚Äù  She looked around and saw her knife and that weird device sitting on a table. 
     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a monster. You deserve nothing short of death,‚Äù ‚ÄòMaster‚Äô yelled as she finished locking the last chain, ‚Äúas long as your hands are detained you can‚Äôt activate the elements.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúWe mustn‚Äôt kill her dear. She‚Äôs only a child. We need to find a way to separate her from Achos.‚Äù A strange man chimed in from the other room. 
     ‚ÄúShe murdered my daughter! It is her fault that Eva is gone! If she would‚Äôve just stayed out of Hickleberry-‚Äú
     ‚ÄúThe only reason I went back there is because I wasn‚Äôt gonna let those ‚ÄòPrime Guards‚Äô tell me what to do!‚Äù
      The man ran into the room. He had a massive dark scar across his face. ‚ÄúWhat did you just say?‚Äù
      ‚ÄúI was saying that I wasn‚Äôt going to let the ‚ÄòPrime Guards‚Äô bos-‚Äú ‚ÄòMaster‚Äô instantly covered her mouth. 
     ‚ÄúThe Achonians‚Ä¶they‚Äôre in Hickleberry!‚Äù she screamed, ‚Äúwhen did you see them?‚Äù
     ‚ÄúA few weeks ago..?‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúOh no! They are gonna perform the Rerooting Ritual! I have to go stop them!‚Äù The man ran out of the room.
     Suddenly ‚ÄòMaster‚Äôs‚Äô face switched to something‚Ä¶different ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶‚Äù she whispered, ‚Äúmost of my family is dead, the balance is in chaos, our city is about to collapse‚Ä¶it‚Äôs all because of you.‚Äù They both glanced at the knife on the table. ‚ÄúThank you, Achos,‚Äù she laughed, ‚Äúwhat a wonderful idea.‚Äù 
     Before she could even plead for her life, ‚ÄòMaster‚Äô grabbed the knife from the table. ‚ÄúBye Achos. Have fun in hell.‚Äù 
     She thrusted the knife into Achos‚Äô forehead.


Chapter XV
Me and You

     ‚ÄúSo what does this do anyway?‚Äù Sabre asked.
     ‚ÄúDusk is the element of darkness and absence. I don‚Äôt know the powers to the full extent. But, I know you can go invisible and create portals.‚Äù 
      Sabre tapped her palm and suddenly disappeared. ‚ÄúWoah! That‚Äôs weird. How do I create portals?‚Äù 
      ‚ÄúMy father had a massive scar on his face that was like an infinite storage space. I think he accidentally created a portal on his face. Maybe if we went back to my old home we could figure out how to make them.‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúYour old home? Where‚Äôs that?‚Äù Sabre asked.
     ‚ÄúHickleberry Forest.‚Äù 
     Sabre's face shifted. She touched her forehead. Her finger ran down the large scar on it. Hickleberry‚Ä¶that place. It felt like it just happened, even though it was years ago‚Ä¶

~ ‚Ä¶ ~

     She opened her eyes. A throbbing pain was in her forehead. The shackles that tied her down before were smashed on the ground.
     A shadowy figure was hunched over a dead body. The shadow was examining the body's hand. 
     ‚ÄúAh, so you‚Äôre awake,‚Äù the shadow calmly said.
     ‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶who are you?‚Äù Delilah asked.
    ‚ÄúI think you already know the answer to that.‚Äù The shadow picked the black knife up from the ground. It chopped the hand off the dead body. Strangely, no blood came out. ‚ÄúHold this, would you?‚Äù
     She took the hand. It felt real but it was made out of nothing but skin. No bones or veins. There was a symbol carved into the top of it.
     ‚ÄúWhat symbol is this?‚Äù Delilah asked. 
     ‚ÄúThat is Zenith. The 5th and final element. This woman here died so I could have it. She killed you, you know.‚Äù
     Delilah looked closer at the body. It was ‚ÄòMaster‚Äô. Delilah felt her forehead. A massive cut was stabbed into it. Blood soaked her hand.
     ‚ÄúI brought you back, Right now, I‚Äôm the only thing keeping you alive,‚Äù the shadow chuckled, ‚Äúconsider it a favor for helping me.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Achos, aren't you?‚Äù Delilah asked. The shadow nodded. It handed her the knife. It was covered in blood, probably hers.
     ‚ÄúMe and You, Sabre. Together we will rule the new country.‚Äù
      New country? What did it mean? ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Sabre?‚Äù The shadow paused for a moment.
     ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your new name. You will become the ruler of Achos, my new country. My followers have almost completed the Rerooting Ritual.‚Äù 
     The shadow touched Delilah‚Äôs shoulder and its appearance changed to copy her. ‚ÄúNow if you need help, I am you. I will protect you and handle anything you need. All you need to do is obey.‚Äù
     Delilah nodded. If it was the only way to survive, she would have to do it. 
     ‚ÄúNow first order,‚Äù Achos started, ‚Äúgive me your symbols.‚Äù She pointed to the knife in Delilah‚Äôs hand. 
     ‚ÄúYou want me to‚Ä¶cut them off?‚Äù 
     ‚ÄúCorrect.‚Äù 
     Delilah inched the knife towards her hand. The thought of cutting up her palm made her sick. ‚ÄúClose your eyes,‚Äù Achos whispered, ‚Äúit makes it easier.‚Äù 
     Delilah obeyed. She shut her eyes and cut off the symbols.


Chapter XVI
Hands

     She wanted to die. She remembered everything. She summoned Achos‚Ä¶
     That day, the day of the Rerooting Ritual, she gave Achos everything. She gave her whole life. So many innocent people died. She didn‚Äôt want to‚Ä¶
     ‚ÄúTell me what happened that day, Sabre. The Rerooting Ritual, what was it?‚Äù Lily asked. 
      ‚ÄúAchos, that thing, had a cult following. They planned to kill every single person living in Hickleberry. They wanted to change it to Achos; with new citizens, new rules, a new life.‚Äù She covered her face, she was a monster. ‚ÄúThey succeeded. With my help.‚Äù 
     Lily looked down. ‚ÄúSo it was you who killed me then?‚Äù 
     ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Ä¶she was slowly taking control of me. I didn‚Äôt kno-‚Äú Lily punched her in the face. She fell over. 
     ‚ÄúSo it was you who killed my family.‚Äù She gripped the knife. 
     ‚ÄúLily, please. I would never do that on my own accord,‚Äù Sabre said as blood dripped from her mouth.
     She crawled backwards. ‚ÄúPlease, I don‚Äôt wanna figh-‚Äú Lily plunged the knife into the ground, missing Sabre by an inch. She stumbled up, tapping her palm to heal herself.

This probably qualifies as the dumbest question in the world but I will ask anyways :) .. I spilled my flavored coffee laced with lots of brown sugar on a book that per my wife's request I keep outside in our garage (in Florida, USA) on a bookshelf.   The book survived surprisingly well but I now have dried coffee presumably with lots of dried sugar in it on a fair number of the pages.

1i8l9it,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i8l9it/please_help_me_with_my_story_what_should_i_do/,Please help me with my story. What should I do? What does she want?,"Ok everyone, I have a complicated one for you! Me and my ex were friends for 7 years before dating. There was always something there but time never lined up until it did in 2022, where we started dating and lived together for a while in college as well. We dated for just under 3 years. 

The last 2-3 months of the relationship were rough and I did not treat her properly. There was no abuse or manipulation but I was depressed and I pushed her away until the point that she ended things with me on October 10th.

I begged I pleaded I wrote letters and I did the whole 9 yards for atleast a month. On and off every couple of weeks. We met up before Christmas and I gave her a little gift in which I made for her that she always asked me for and she accepted and received it.

Since then I started no contact since Christmas. Where she waited until 9:30 pm and actually wished me a merry Christmas in which I responded. 

Now with that backstory, Since being in no contact is he has sent some massive mixed signals. Examples:
She readded me to her private Snapchat story I had left
She followed my new private instagram page I made but refuses to like or comment on anything
She wished my brother a merry Christmas
And lastly she went to a concert and posted lyrics on her story about missing an ex

Simultaneously she has been hanging out with other new guys from her hometown, in which she has posted them on her story and I found out the concert she went to was attended with him. Recently she also deleted all but 2 of my comments on her instagram pictures.

So with all of those mixed signals I‚Äôm wondering if any of you guys have any opinions on what I should do. In the long run I know the relationship did fail because of me and I‚Äôd like to reconcile, but if she moves on I am ok and willing to, it‚Äôs just hard to interpret what she wants from the mixed signals. 

I think my options are 1. Reach out ask for coffee and see if she is accepting, 
2. Text her saying hey I noticed some things over social media, I don‚Äôt blame you if it wasn‚Äôt on purpose but I just wanted to clear up some things, I noticed you followed my pages and added me to your story but I was pretty hurt seeing my comments deleted, is it time for me to move on or are you still unsure on what you want?
3. Send a fond memory
4. Stay in no contact until further notice

I just am torn between the weird subtle messages she wants to be apart of my life and the messages that seems as if she is moving on and any insight

Is there alternatives? Thanks!,"So appreciate anyone who reads this through all the way. Let me say this first, I've tried going to link checker sites and several said that it was unwanted content and they won't even check the links. That's kinda what  made me stop and be like ""wut?"" I thought maybe these url checker sites could tell me what is on there so that I know.

But the reason  I'm asking is because... it didn't really bother me so much because these pages are on Facebook openly sitting there so I found it strange but not really too strange however my man seems to like these pages a lot and I always just found it weird. 

But basically I've always found it weird how my man (who I know in real life, I went to school with them,) has all these accounts he follows openly but they are sites leading to suspicious links. And I've always been ultra curious as to what they are but I'm not entirely sure. Like one page is actually a page dedicated  to some sport but it has a site that I've never heard of and a . mp4 attached to every one of the posts.

In other profiles, they are all random women and from first glance, you think it's a profile of an actual person because at first, it seems to be set up that way.  There will be one or two posts of the girl in the photo drinking coffee or saying something personal but the more you scroll, the more it changes women and they look different until you just realize that they're actually all different women. 

One link I ran just now actually just did a malware check on the link to the sport account that had the . mp4 attached to it but not a preview (the ones that have previews refuse to show these links,) but it came back flagged as highly suspicious on just the ones that checked for malware. 

But I mean, in order for my man to follow these accounts... he'd have to click on the links right? But if the links contain malware... then why is he following these people",1,1737686288.0,computers,3,1.0,False

1i8l13g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1i8l13g/why_am_i_still_having_joint_pain/,Why am I still having joint pain?,"34F, white, hetero, 5'6, 130lbs. Don't smoke, haven't had alcohol in over 5 years - due to mininimal tolerance issues and anxiety. Had a daughter in 2022.

Prior existing conditions before: anxiety & depression
Medications: Zoloft 50mg from 2019-early 2022, intermittent vitamins and Tylenol. 

Multiple different birth controls that didn't stick; worsened anxiety and depression. 
I stopped Zoloft during pregnancy.

In 2022 I welcomed my daughter into this world. During my pregnancy, I put on 80lbs, but had no issues other than constant terrible lower back pain. I've never put in this much weight in my life, kind of took me by surprise, but no indications of diabetes or thyroid issues. 
After the birth, it's like hell broke loose on my body. I had no appetite and felt like a shell. I was put in a high dose of naproxen to take 2x a day for a 3rd degree tear and incredible back pain.  

When my period started to try to come back (2 months in), my body went into this repeated shock state. I would wake up with a racing heart, throw up anything I ate or drank and just stay nausous most of the day. I would shake, cry and couldn't figure out wtf was going on. Checked thyroid and cortisol, had high cortisol but they linked that to postpartum anxiety. Saw a psychiatrist.

Eventually went on a myriad of antidepressants over the next year and a half to placate those symptoms:
- couldn't tolerate : busparone, dyciclomine, etc
1. Zoloft 50mg (2 months)
2. Effexor XR 37.5mg (4 months) + propranolol as needed 
3. Lamictal slow increase (2 months) - panic attacks that lasted hours
4. Lamotragine slow increase (3 months) - made me progressively more anxious and farigued

In March of 2023, I weaned off the last medication and felt great. In June I got really sick with something - I was throwing up bad again daily, constant nausea/stomach problems, developed a bad cough and pneumonia. I had a high fever for over a week - which has never happened to me before. We rotated Tylenol and Ibuprofen, did antibiotics etc. 

Since then, I've had rotating issues with my stomach and joints. I was diagnosed with SIBO in November and properly treated in January by the correct doctor with neomycin and rifaximin. For months I was dealing with constipation, morning nausea and vomiting spells, random joint pain flare ups, etc. 

Doctors I've seen:
Endocrinologist, rheumatologist, immunologist/allergist, primary, gynecologist and a gastroenterologist. 
All labs with Endo were normal (although in the beginning cortisol was high, then really low)
All labs with rheumatologist were normal - did notice indications of Raynaud's, shrugged off my symptoms to be SIBO related. I'll be following up with them soon. 
Original labs with immunology showed low iGb levels and ana positive. Retook the tests again 6 weeks after pneumovax and I was ana negative. 
Allergy panels came back negative for prick test 
Gastroenterologist treated the positive SIBO tests. 
We've tested for hypylori back in June and was positive, again in November and was negative. 

Functional doctor, we've tested hormones, gut biome etc. Indications of gut inflammation, low iron, high estrogen. But nothing I've done with them has shown any significance to the joint pain. I've tried digestive enzymes, atrantil, ginger, vitamin b complex (can't tolerate anymore), l glutamine (made me depressed), testosterone (highly irritable).

I'm also suddenly very sensitive to medication/vitamin absorltion. I used to be on 50mg of Zoloft, but now I can only tolerate 1/4 of that. I used to take vitamin b and drink coffee and now it sends me into a panic attack. 

When I have these joint pains, it's not consistent what triggers it; eggs, certain spices, gluten, intense temperature changes, repeated movements etc. Tylenol, Ibuprofen, etc sometimes help but not always. The most painful parts are my elbows, shoulders and hands. Feels like someone's squeezing them. 

Anytime my bowels get agitated 
as well, this also tends to happen, so it seems their may be a link to stomach inflammation triggering the joints or some connection. Hormonal fluctuations also trigger the flare ups. 

My PCP recommended me to get a second opinion with a rheumatologist and a connective tissue doctor. I've done SO many labs and have an x-ray scheduled. I'm just so frustrated.  ",1,1737685640.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

We met for coffee and then we went back to his later, we chatted and then watched a movie in bed together. We cuddled, frotted and kissed, it was so lovely but unfortunately I couldn't stay the night. But I'm going meeting him again this weekend for a night.

I'm just maybe insecure, but Id honestly love to ask him on a date because we get on very well and we chat everyday and he's mentioned a few times that he likes me. 

But I just feel I'm not right for him. I'm worried about getting into a proper relationship after being in a situationship for close to 2 years. I kind of feel too maybe I'm out of his league, as he's way better looking than me. Also I'm only out to my mom and I feel if I'm not out to the rest of my family it could hinder my relationship with him if I were to bring him to my home town and if someone say us together it could cause some issues. 

I'm torn, I don't know what to do, Id love him as a friend, but also in a relationship as in Ireland it's next to near impossible to be in a gay relationship in anywhere but Dublin.

He has no assets other than his brand new car. His primary expenses (housing and groceries) are covered by his wife, whose own assets are separate from him and in a trust. He has a business where he sells his art, but his art business is hitting it's 2nd or 3rd year of not being profitable. The main things he spends money on as far as I know are getting coffee to get out of the house, personal care items (diapers, clothes, deodorant), and fishing stuff. He gets a monthly social security payment. With all of that said, he has a lot of credit card debt that he is only paying minimums on. 

He has no plans to finance any large purchases in the future, so I don't see a need for him to attempt to maintain good credit. His wife and I have been pushing him to get rid of his car, and he has been amenable to the suggestion, as his wife and him can share a car at this point. His wife is financially independent and does not need him financially for anything. If he needs long term care in the future, he will likely immediately qualify for Medicare and the family has been prepared for that eventuality for a while. 

My questions are - is there a way I can maximize his CASH flow at this point in time to where he is able to pay for his little ancillary items (coffee, deodorant etc) as opposed to putting it all towards credit card minimums? Additionally, If these credit cards are under a business name (which I don't know the answer to as of yet), is there a point where he can stop paying the minimums on them without it mattering - like if he stops his business due to lack of profit without filing for bankruptcy? Would it be worthwhile to look into renegotiating his credit card minimums to make his monthly cash flow a bit better? How much should I be worrying about his cash flow as he becomes less and less active in the world (and spends less and less money because he can't really leave the house)? 



Here are the specifics that I know for certain:

Social Security Income: $2,616

Credit Card Minimums:

Capital One Card 1: $525

Capital One Card 2: $175

Capital One Card 3: $119

Capital One Card 4: $163

BOA Minimum: $270 

Chase Card: $335

Discover Card: $204

Phone Bill: $142.93 (I'm working on convincing him to get with another cheaper phone plan, but he is \*still\* paying off an old phone he no longer has that he financed, which is a large portion of the bill)

Car Payment: $536 (his wife pays for car insurance for them both)



\*\*TLDR: My retired dad is (assuming he gets rid of his car) netting about $682.07 a month (which, no, isn't that bad!) in cash from his Social Security after paying credit card minimums. Any suggestions on how/if I can assist him in improving that?\*\*

1i8kru8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i8kru8,Slight discolored tooth and sensitivity to heat,"Non-smoker and non-drinker but I do drink coffee and as you can see the tooth that's circled is between two teeth that sort of pin the tooth in question. I've had TMJ for about 5 years but this issue is very recent as of 3 days ago after switching from sensodyne to perodontax. The tooth is only sensitive to hot, and I'm concerned about the discoloration, which I think is new but I can't say for sure. Gums are fine, no swelling or abscess.

Any guidance on this?",1,1737684866.0,askdentists,2,1.0,False
