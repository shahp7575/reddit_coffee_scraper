I got it at a stressful time after a covid infection, when I took oral prednisolone, ibuprofen and iron supplements to manage asthma, period pains and anemia.

The symptoms started exactly one year ago and I was in incredible pain for months. I could barely eat anything, lost a lot of weight. I changed my diet, it took a while to figure out what worked and what didn't. I really thought I would never feel better but I do! For me it helped to avoid stress and this subreddit, and just try and be more patient. Because even if I did everything right, the effects were always a bit delayed. I took PPIs for 3 months, famotidine and antacids for a while but didn't exactly feel a positive effect long after I stopped.

I'm not a 100% healed, I still wouldn't touch any alcohol or too much spice, and I still experience reflux sometimes but overall I live an almost normal life again. I can even drink coffee a few times a week without any discomfort. I eat a regular amount and if I experience discomfort I eat more of my safe foods to give my stomach a break.

*In the Fallen Groghorn Inn, there are plenty of patrons enjoying their food and drink, and plenty of frost trolls make bets on arm wrestling. Yet, in on corner table sits a hooded figure armored in Kafnez steel. His hands well jeweled and as dark as spruce wood, a desert elf. He frowns as he notices his coffee has gone cold, so he holds on finger over the mug and within seconds the liquid begins to steam from extreme heat, he then grins as he takes a sip. Around this time, a familiar looking frost troll walks through the door, a scarred left eye as white as snow, a three clawed scar across his left pectoral muscle, and a bite make on the back of his neck. The elf, at first, ignores the troll, believing who he looks like to be long dead.*

Borris: ""1 gallon of barrel brew, please.""

*Yet the elf never forgets a voice, he stands from his seat as a mystic aura fills the room. He approaches and rests one hand on Borris's shoulder and grins as Borris looks up to see an old friend.*

Borris: ""Dang Hai!?""

*Borris thrusts from his seat and lifts Dang in the air with a hug, and anyone could easily hear something crunching.*

Dang Hai: ""Yep, that would indeed be a Borris hug. Put me down, please.""

Borris: ""oh, sorry. Forgot how puny you were. Hey, you know where Billy Joe is? We should get the old group together.""

Dang: ""Last I heard, he's in Star gaze all the way in Nevernight, taking care of some business. I really went my own way to study history.""

*The two exit the building, where Geo has been waiting.*

Borris: ""Oh yeah, Geo this is Dang Hai. Dang Hai the is Geo.""

Geo: ""Greetings...""

Dang: ""Fascinating, a machination this far from any Humanoid run settlement. Now, I suppose we should all head to Nevernight...""

Geo: ""My scanners indicate that Nevernight is over 40,000 miles away on the other side of Nuberen, and may I remind you that we are here for 2 weeks...""

Dang: ""Don't worry about that, I got a few tricks up my sleeve. I can promise at least half of you will make it.""

*Sidgles form on the ground ground below every one's feet as magic begins to fill the air.*

Geo: ""Hold!""

*Dang Hai snaps and the group is sucked into three vortexes that appear and shut behind them.*

*Meanwhile, over the Hurricane sea, Loui and many other snow elves are being flown to the North Pole by reindeer and sled, of course, the reindeer are Nuberen reindeer, meaning they can fly naturally. The frozen island in the distance can be seen, heavily guarded by Nutcrackers and attack turkeys. The snow elves are loaded of the sled and registered one by one.*

Nutcracker: ""Next.""

*Loui steps forward.*

Nutcracker: ""Place your hand on the device and state your name.""

Loui: ""Berry Overpine.""

*Loui needs to use an alias to remain unnoticed long enough to find the next heir and map out any weaknesses in the security*

1haiukp,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancun/comments/1haiukp/trip_retrospective_paradisus_cancun/,Trip Retrospective: Paradisus Cancun,"Hey everyone! I searched a lot on this subreddit when picking an AI and Cancun, so I thought I'd return the favor by posting a trip retrospective on what I thought of Paradisus Cancun for any future travelers. I'll be as detailed as possible!

Dates: Early December

Price: A little over $500/night for the reserve presidential suite (it was a 50% off Black Friday sale)

Clientele: Mostly 50+ year olds during this time (we were a young couple in our 20s); however there were some younger groups and many families in the main pyramid with young kids

What was included: Transportation to and from airport; all meals/room service; 2 days Bali bed; alcohol/drinks; sunset boat ride on lagoon; one dinner at Sal's

Retrospective:

Before we arrived, a concierge reached out to us over email asking what our favorite drinks are and they reserved restaurants for the first three nights as well as the cabanas for the second and fourth day. They also arranged free transport with Otium where we got an email about where to meet them and were told that we have 40 minutes from when the first passenger from our arrives to get to the van when we land.

**Day 1:** We arrived around 3pm at Cancun International Airport on a Sunday. It wasn't busy at all - we probably got through customs and our bags (Alaska Airlines forced us to check them even though there was a lot of overhead space left) in about 30 minutes. We then walked outdoors to the Otium stand, and waited about 10 minutes for a driver to arrive. We were the only ones going to Paradisus, so we left immediately. The driver was nice and handles our luggage. We tipped about 100 pesos. We then got to Paradisus in about 25 minutes.

At Paradisus, we were told to walk inside to the left from pyramid three through pyramid 4 to arrive at the reserve pyramid. It smelled great and the checkin desk had no line. They sat us down, got us water, and within ten minutes gave us our bracelets to the room.

We headed to the presidential suite which was incredible (3700+ square feet!). They had fruit and wine on the table waiting for us, and the mini bar was stocked with I believe 8 different kinds of tequila and vodka as well s other drinks. The fridge was also stocked with water, soda, juice, mixers, champagne, Oreos, fruit bars, nuts, and chips.

After a nap, we headed down to our first reservation for dinner in the main central pyramid at Lemon Fish. We were a bit confused about how to do the all inclusive thing since there were prices on the menu, but they explained the prices are only for non hotel guest, so we a leave whenever. The food was pretty good, but not filling. So we headed to the buffet after, which we surprisingly liked even more (they have lots of unique fruits).

We then had a night stroll around the premises. It was a bit windy due to the hotel zone's location, and not as lush or tropical as what you might find in Hawaii. The pools close at night, but the premises are still nice and large.

We then met our concierge at the reserve lobby after adding him on WhatsApp and he recommended scheduling a sunset tour of the lagoon in two days. They no longer include the cenotes tour, but the lagoon tour was excellent.

**Day 2:** As recommended, I got up early to go to the cabana checkout by the pool. My cabana had been pre reserved with a great location by the pool since it's the presidential suite. They also offered an exclusive ocean front cabana since we were presidential, but since it was windy we opted for poolside.

We spent much of the day by the pool with consistent pool service, tipping around 40-50 pesos each drink. We were also joined by a cute resort cat. I don't think the pool was heated and it was a bit chilly from other resort pools I'm used to.

We tried to get lunch at 11am but unfortunately nearly all the restaurants were closed then. We spent a while walking around trying to find out what's open. Reception told us the cafe at the reserve section was still serving food, but when we got there they too said they were closed until tomorrow. We waiting a bit and eventually got to the Mexican restaurant blue agave. It was probably one of the better restaurants even though the soup was room temperature. We then booked a Cenotes tour for the following day with Aquaworld, who have a cabana on premises. It was about $220 total for two people for a 7 hour day with 5 hiplines and 3 cents.

For dinner we ate at Sal's. Even though it's the only restaurant you need reservations for and can only eat once without paying, it was probably the most disappointing. They seemed to prefer the non-inclusive guests over the inclusive ones, and almost seemed a little annoyed we were there. The food was pretty good, but not for the price we would have had to pay if it wasn't included. A lot of the menu and their cocktails are also not included if you re an inclusive guest, which was a bummer since our options were limited.

When we got back to our hotel, our concierge had arranged some more wine and delicious chocolates to be left in our room. It was very kind. We got late night room service at around 1am which was surprisingly really good (nachos and pasta).

**Day 3:** We woke up early to go to aqua world across the street for the Cenotes tour. Even though they told us to arrive at 7:15 am, we had to wait until closer to 8:15 am since apparently the other guests the driver picked up were late. We left our waterproof phone cases in the room and definitely had time to go back for them, but they recommended buying them there, and they were over $30. Despite the rough start, the Cenotes tour was beautiful with zip lining into a cenote, cave swimming, and cliff jumping. They had a tequila tasting at the end that was unfortunately soiled by a disguised time share pitch from an outside company (luckily it was only about 5 minutes) where we filled out their forms with fake info since they didn't mention that sort of thing would be part of the tour, but the buffet afterwards was delicious.

Back at the hotel, we had dinner at the Italian restaurant Cappella. We heard great things, but unfortunately this too was underwhelming with small portion sizes and it took forever. We again went to the buffet afterwards since we were disappointed by the restaurant.

We then went to the main lobby to meet our concierge who led us to the group on their way back to aqua world for the sunset catamaran on the lagoon. There were probably about 100 people, free drinks, and live music. It was beautiful and a blast -- lasted about 1 hour.

We tried to watch Netflix back at the hotel but the main living room TV was so confusing to use (I'm young and good with tech, but we had to switch out some batteries and bring in the remote from the bedroom to actually get it to work). Still, it's a nice TV.

**Day 4:** We had breakfast at the buffet which was decent -- the American food is generally bad, but the tamales and fruit were great. We opted for an ocean-front cabana, which was great. Though it's windy, it's not too bad inside the cabana, and you can't beat the views. The red flags were out since the waves were rough, but we still swam and felt safe (though a couple of waves took me out).

We then had lunch at Sante (adults only oceanside restaurant), and were surprised that it was actually a bit better than the other restaurants we ate at.

We then had a XCaret Bus pick us up at the main lobby and take us to Xplor Fuego. That was not included in the price, but was probably the highlight of Cancun. The buffet at Xplor is also the best food that we had our whole trip. The bus then took us back to the hotel.

**Day 5:** Checkout day, we had a quick grab and go breakfast at the coffee shop in the reserve section. I again was surprised that their pre prepared sandwiches tasted better than most of the food at the sit-down restaurants. A bellhop collected our luggage from the room and we checkout out at the reserve lobby, and said goodbye to our great concierge.

They let us stay using our benefits past the 12pm checkout, so we ate at Sante again, grabbed some coffee, rested on the interior Bali beds, then got our luggage. We ordered an uber since we were going to the ferry station, and the bellhop informed security so that they allow the uber straight through the gate to pick us up at the main entrance.

**Overall**, for the 50% off price, I easily give it a 4.5/5 and would go again if I needed an AI hotel experience. It was my first AI however, and I learned that I prefer exploring the city more/trying out local restaurants rather than mediocre restaurants, but it's good to try once. Everything, from service to rooms to location, are a clear 5/5. Vibes might be a 3.5/5 just because it sometimes leans more shopping mall than a Bali resort and there are times during peak day hours where it feels like all the restaurants are closed, and the food is a 3/5, but the positives and service far outweigh these slight drawbacks.",1,1733774504.0,cancun,1,1.0,False
1haiu1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamondsreview/comments/1haiu1c/diamond_clarity_guide_expert_tips_for_best_value/,Diamond Clarity Guide: Expert Tips for Best Value,"Diamond clarity grades span from Flawless (FL) to Included (I3), with prices varying by up to 300% between grades that can look identical to the naked eye. Market analysis shows that 80% of engagement ring buyers choose diamonds in the VS2 to SI1 range for natural diamonds, where optimal value intersects with eye-clean appearance.

Recent pricing data reveals that stepping down from VVS1 to VS2 clarity can save 30-40% without compromising visible beauty, as over 80% of VS2 diamonds appear identical to higher grades to the untrained eye for 1.00 carat diamonds and lower. Industry experts consistently recommend prioritizing cut quality over clarity, as brilliance and fire have far greater impact on a diamond's visual appeal.

This comprehensive guide provides expert strategies for navigating diamond clarity grades, including specific price-to-value analysis across different carat weights, and practical tips for identifying eye-clean diamonds that maximize both beauty and budget.

# Bottom Line

When it comes to diamond clarity, understanding the nuances can significantly elevate your purchasing experience. Here's what you need to know:

* Clarity grades range from Flawless (FL) to Included (I3). Most diamonds in the top six grades are eye-clean.
* Graders consider factors such as size, nature, number, location, and relief of inclusions5
* Clarity has minimal effect on visual beauty in higher grades. Eye-clean diamonds often look identical regardless of their exact grade.
* VS2 to SI1 diamonds often offer excellent value, providing beauty without breaking the bank.
* Inclusions: Internal flaws within the diamond
* Blemishes: External flaws on the diamond's surface
* Inclusions can add character to a diamond, creating a unique ""fingerprint.""
* Cut quality is fundamentally more important than clarity for brilliance and sparkle.
* Always seek certified diamonds and communicate clearly about ""eye-clean"" expectations, especially for SI1 grades.
* Recommended Vendors: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing from trusted retailers that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

# Who is this for?

* Diamond buyers looking to make informed decisions
* Value seekers wanting the best bang for their buck
* Those interested in understanding how clarity impacts diamond beauty and price

# Who is this not for?

* Buyers fixated on top-tier clarity without considering overall quality
* Those highly sensitive to any imperfections, even if invisible to the naked eye
* Shoppers expecting flawless clarity on a tight budget

# Recommendations for smart buying

1. Prioritize cut quality over clarity for maximum brilliance
2. Aim for eye-clean diamonds in the VS2 to SI1 range for best value
3. Use magnified videos or images to inspect diamonds, especially for online purchases
4. Consider the diamond's size - larger stones may show inclusions more easily
5. Be aware that different shapes can hide inclusions better (e.g., emerald cuts show inclusions more readily than round brilliants)
6. Always buy certified diamonds from reputable sources like GIA or AGS

# FAQ

Q: What exactly is diamond clarity?A: Diamond clarity refers to the presence or absence of inclusions and blemishes in a diamond.

Q: How does clarity affect a diamond's price?  
A: Higher clarity grades are rarer and thus more expensive. However, the price jump can be significant between grades that look identical to the naked eye.

Q: What does ""eye-clean"" mean?  
A: An eye-clean diamond has no visible inclusions to the naked eye under normal viewing conditions.

Q: Are all SI1 diamonds eye-clean?  
A: Not necessarily. It depends on the size, location, and nature of the inclusions. Always inspect SI1 diamonds carefully.

Q: How important is clarity compared to other diamond qualities?  
A: While clarity is important, cut quality has a much greater impact on a diamond's beauty and brilliance.

Remember, the goal is to find a diamond that looks beautiful to you while maximizing your budget. Don't get caught up in chasing perfection on paper if it doesn't translate to visible beauty in the real world.

My question revolves around the bird behavior. Is it possible they were reacting to what my dog was doing or could it just have been the fact my dog was there? I have never heard them do anything like this before so I am wondering if the 2 events are connected.

Any insights would be greatly appreciated.",1,1733774262.0,birding,0,1.0,False

Doctors say it‚Äôs the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome, or ‚Äòsympathetic pregnancy‚Äô they‚Äôve ever seen. How to prepare for seeing family and our twins‚Äô arrival?","Hi everyone, I‚Äôve been dealing with this extremely bizarre and surreal situation over the past year, and I could really use some advice. With the holidays approaching and the twins‚Äô arrival getting closer, I‚Äôm trying to mentally and physically prepare for what‚Äôs ahead‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs navigating family reactions over Christmas or figuring out how I can be the best partner to my wife once the babies arrive, even with my current size and challenges. If anyone has thoughts or suggestions, I‚Äôd appreciate it.

I never thought I‚Äôd be writing this, but after what‚Äôs happened to my body over the past 9+ months, I feel like I‚Äôm living in a surreal medical case study. My wife and I (both 31) are expecting our first children‚Äîtwins!‚Äîand her pregnancy has been going as smoothly as possible. But for me, things took a very bizarre turn. Early in her pregnancy, I began experiencing symptoms of what‚Äôs called Couvade Syndrome, or ‚Äúsympathetic pregnancy,‚Äù where men mimic some of their partner‚Äôs pregnancy symptoms. At first, it was funny‚Äîme complaining about morning nausea and intense cravings while my wife teased me for being dramatic. But as the weeks went on, the symptoms became extreme.

Within 9+ months, I‚Äôve gained over 130 pounds, and it‚Äôs all gone to my belly.  Doctors have tested me for every possible condition‚ÄîCushing‚Äôs syndrome, hypothyroidism, ascites, insulin resistance, and a laundry list of rare disorders. They ran metabolic panels, hormone tests, and even MRIs to rule out anything that could explain this transformation. Everything came back normal. After countless appointments with endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and dietitians, the consensus is unanimous: this is the most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome they‚Äôve ever seen. My body has gone into a hyper-sympathetic state, mimicking my wife‚Äôs pregnancy so intensely that I now look more pregnant than she does.

Here‚Äôs the wildest part: my belly has grown to an unbelievable 67+ inches in circumference. It‚Äôs perfectly round, heavy, and tight‚Äîso much so that doctors have compared it to an overdue pregnancy with triplets or even quadruplets. I‚Äôve been experiencing cravings, hormonal changes, and even bizarre moments of arousal that have made this entire experience surreal and difficult to process.

The public‚Äôs stares reactions to me have been nothing short of overwhelming. Everywhere I go, people treat me like a walking sideshow attraction. Strangers constantly stop me on the street to ask, ‚ÄúWhen are you due?‚Äù or ‚ÄúAre you having twins‚Äîor is it triplets?‚Äù Sometimes, people assume I‚Äôm joking when I say I‚Äôm not pregnant or assure them that my belly is real, even, and not a costume. One particularly embarrassing encounter happened when a man followed me in his car, yelling ‚ÄúHey, heifer! How‚Äôd you get so huge, fatass!‚Äù and filming me as I struggled to walk. He kept shouting out the window, ‚ÄúWhen are the babies due?‚Äù and even taunted me to run, laughing as I awkwardly waddled down the street. 

Another time, a homeless man trailed me for blocks, loudly asking, ‚ÄúAre you sick? What happened to you? You can still fix this. You look like you‚Äôre about to pop!‚Äù His comments drew stares from others, and the whole experience left me humiliated. Once, at a grocery store, I reached for something on a high shelf, and the movement caused my shirt to ride up, exposing my belly. A woman nearby loudly gasped and asked if I was okay, or pregnant, and when I assured her I wasn‚Äôt pregnant, she looked me up and down in disbelief before walking away, shaking her head.  Thankfully, some guys are entertained or supportive, and say things like ‚ÄúDamn, bro, that‚Äôs the most impressive belly I‚Äôve ever seen. Take care of yourself. That‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù

Our small town caught wind of what was happening to me and even ran a story in the local paper. They did a photo shoot with me and my wife, documenting what they called ‚Äúthe most extreme case of Couvade Syndrome on record.‚Äù The article focused on the medical mystery and included photos of me standing next to my wife, both of us cradling our bellies. At one point, they measured my stomach circumference on camera, which was mortifying. The reporter joked that I looked more overdue than my wife, and the whole experience left me red-faced, especially when people in town started recognizing me from the article and stopping me to ask questions.

Family and friends have been equally baffled. My wife‚Äôs parents were initially concerned and suggested I get immediate medical attention, while my own family didn‚Äôt believe it at first and thought I was exaggerating. Now, it‚Äôs become a mix of humor and genuine concern. Even at work, my coworkers started a playful due date countdown for me, marking it on the office calendar alongside my wife‚Äôs.

Despite the jokes, I feel terrible that my transformation has overshadowed my wife‚Äôs pregnancy. What should have been a time focused on her and the excitement of our twins has turned into a community spectacle about my bizarre condition. She‚Äôs been incredibly supportive and laughs it off, joking that I‚Äôm taking some of the heat off her by becoming the bigger attraction. But I can‚Äôt help feeling guilty‚Äîthis was supposed to be her moment, and instead, I‚Äôm the one everyone‚Äôs talking about.

Meanwhile, I‚Äôve struggled to maintain a sense of normalcy. My shirts don‚Äôt fit anymore, riding up over my belly and exposing the lower half every time I move. I‚Äôve tried buying larger sizes, but even those don‚Äôt last long before I outgrow them. Just the other day, I bent down to tie my shoe at work, and the strain caused a button to pop off my shirt, shooting across the office like a missile. Everyone heard it, and I had to awkwardly laugh it off while turning red. Another time, I stretched to grab something at a 711, and the seam of my shirt tore open right down the side, leaving me scrambling to cover myself. My pants aren‚Äôt any better‚Äîthey‚Äôre so tight under the curve of my gut that I‚Äôve split the seams more times than I care to admit.

At work, I‚Äôm required to wear a uniform‚Äîa button-up shirt, no less‚Äîand squeezing into it has become a nightmare. The buttons pull so tight that I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll pop, and they often do‚Äîsometimes in front of coworkers or even clients, which is humiliating. I‚Äôve started bringing safety pins to hold my shirts together in emergencies, but even those can barely contain the strain. Each week, I‚Äôm outgrowing something else, to the point where I‚Äôm running out of options entirely.

Getting dressed in the morning has become a daily battle. Pulling my pants up under the massive curve of my belly feels like trying to fit into a sausage casing. The waistband digs into me so tightly that it makes my gut stick out even more, exaggerating its size and making me look even more absurdly pregnant. My belt creaks and groans whenever I sit down, and I constantly worry it‚Äôs going to snap. Even sitting in a chair has become a spectacle; I have to ease myself down slowly to avoid bursting buttons or causing the furniture to creak under my weight.

Movement is an entirely different challenge. I can barely bend over to tie my shoes without my belly pressing hard against my thighs, forcing me to hold my breath just to reach the laces. I‚Äôve started wearing slip-ons to avoid the embarrassment. Getting in and out of my car is another ordeal‚Äîit feels like I‚Äôm wedging myself into a tight space, my belly brushing against the steering wheel no matter how far back I push the seat. Walking down the street, my belly bounces and jiggles with every step, drawing stares from passersby. Sometimes, I even catch people filming me.

Everyday tasks that used to be simple now feel monumental, and I‚Äôve stopped pretending I can blend in. Despite my best efforts to maintain normalcy, my transformation has made me impossible to ignore.

Doctors have been fascinated by my condition, describing me as a medical anomaly. They‚Äôve even suggested publishing my case in a medical journal, as they‚Äôve never seen anything like it. While I understand their excitement from a scientific perspective, it‚Äôs hard not to feel like a sideshow. I‚Äôve been poked, prodded, and measured so many times that I‚Äôve lost count.

As for other symptoms/side effects, there‚Äôs a lot more to this experience than just the abdominal growth. Early on, we thought it was kind of adorable how in sync my wife and I were during her pregnancy. I‚Äôd wake up nauseous when she did, I‚Äôd have random cravings, and we joked about how empathetic I was being when I‚Äôd have morning sickness. But as things progressed, it became clear this wasn‚Äôt just harmless sympathy symptoms. My body‚Äôs hormonal changes went into overdrive. Alongside the weight gain, I‚Äôve dealt with intense mood swings, exhaustion, and an unsettling sensitivity to smells. Even little things, like the scent of strong coffee, can send me running for fresh air.  The exhaustion hasn‚Äôt helped with me also not being very active during this time. 

Unlike my wife, I‚Äôm not growing two babies, so everything I eat is turning directly into fat, and unfortunately, it‚Äôs all going straight to my belly. The uncontrollable cravings have been a big part of this. I naturally eat more than her as it is, but the hormonal changes I‚Äôve been experiencing‚Äîlike elevated prolactin and cortisol levels‚Äîhave completely derailed any sense of self-control. It‚Äôs as if my body is craving the transformation itself. There have been times I‚Äôve gone on insane binges, eating until I physically couldn‚Äôt anymore‚Ä¶ Even when I wanted to stop, it felt impossible, I was still hungry, like my body was demanding more fuel to keep growing.

Doctors think my body is in a kind of ‚Äúhyper-storage mode,‚Äù where every calorie is being stored as fat, specifically in my abdomen, almost as if it‚Äôs mimicking a pregnancy. Some specialists believe my fat cells in this area might have become overly sensitive to insulin, leading to the rapid, disproportionate fat accumulation. Others suggest that elevated prolactin levels, typically associated with lactation and maternal behaviors, might be affecting how my body stores fat and retains fluid. Combined with some fluid retention in my belly, it‚Äôs created this bizarre, ballooning effect that feels completely out of my control. It‚Äôs crazy to outgrow a shirt in a matter of a couple weeks. 

One of the more difficult‚Äîand frankly embarrassing‚Äîsymptoms has been this bizarre hormonal arousal.  Sorry if it is TMI to share all of this, but it‚Äôs such a large part of the psychological side effects I‚Äôve been dealing with that it would be hard not to include it. My doctors have explained that the surges of prolactin, cortisol, and other pregnancy-related hormones in my system seem to be ‚Äúconfusing‚Äù my body, tricking it into thinking this transformation is something I‚Äôm meant to desire or enjoy. It‚Äôs almost as though my body is trying to gaslight me into embracing the changes so it can continue expanding. They‚Äôve told me that this is likely part of a feedback loop‚Äîmy body experiences embarrassment or awkwardness from how big I‚Äôve gotten and the trouble I have maneuvering or drawing attention, and that stress triggers a hormonal response that leads to an unexpected surge of arousal. That sensation then clouds my judgment, making me crave situations where I feel even more self-conscious, which leads to choices‚Äîlike overeating or not avoiding tight clothes‚Äîthat exacerbate the growth.

This feedback loop is one of the hardest aspects to navigate. It‚Äôs created a cycle where I feel like I‚Äôm feeding into my own situation, literally and figuratively. The arousal itself feels like my body‚Äôs way of pushing me to keep going, even though I logically don‚Äôt want to get bigger or draw more attention. And yet, I‚Äôve found myself leaning into these situations, almost unconsciously seeking out moments that leave me even more embarrassed or humiliated. It‚Äôs such a strange and difficult headspace to be in because I know it‚Äôs my hormones playing tricks on me, but in the moment, it‚Äôs hard to fight against. The doctors are optimistic that these reactions should subside once my wife gives birth and my hormones stabilize, but until then, I‚Äôm doing my best to stay mindful and not let this cycle get even more out of control.

At the end of the day, I‚Äôm still at a loss. My body feels alien to me, and every day brings new challenges. I‚Äôve started wondering if this condition will reverse after my wife gives birth‚Äîor if this is something I‚Äôll be living with for the rest of my life.

Now that you‚Äôve read all that, you can probably imagine how overwhelming this has been‚Äînot just for me, but for my wife and our family as well. Christmas is coming up, and it‚Äôll be the first time many family members see me in person since this transformation. I know they‚Äôre already shocked by the photos, but I have no idea how to handle their reactions when I walk in the room. Do you think I should try to diffuse the awkwardness with humor, or just brace myself for the comments and move on? I‚Äôd love to hear how you think I can prepare for that emotionally.

Also, with the twins on the way, I‚Äôm worried about how I‚Äôll physically keep up with helping my wife care for two newborns. Even simple tasks like getting up quickly or bending over are incredibly difficult now, and I don‚Äôt want her to feel like she‚Äôs doing everything on her own. Has anyone here dealt with physical limitations while caring for babies? What are some ways I can make sure I‚Äôm still present and helpful despite my size and lack of mobility?

Finally, I‚Äôd be curious to hear if you‚Äôve ever come across a case like this, or if you have any ideas I haven‚Äôt thought of about how to better manage the reactions, logistics, or even just the emotional toll. Thanks for reading and for any advice you can offer!

(in the Buddhist way),"I'm making a system to recalibrate my center and cultivate growth and wellness on a day to day basis. A big part of this goober project is the dimension of Inner Morale. So I'll have to check in daily and see if I have positive morale, negative morale, or if it's tilting towards negativity or tilting up towards positivity. When my morale meter gets too low I want to have a list of practices to boost it towards being positive. The things that work for me with the least drawbacks are exercise, coffee, going for walks outdoors without my phone, and meditation. Then there is the adjacent Pleasure-seeking category of boost - that comes with some drawbacks - such as video games, watching stand up comedy (seeking laughter), and recreational drug use. (These have their utility so I don't want to dogmatically deny them. Yet I also want to recognize their ultimately unsatisfactory nature.)

What does Buddhism have to say about the maintenance of one's inner morale? Are there any additional practices that may be worth trying? And what do you think about my project to come up with a system to course-correct my life and recalibrate it periodically? Is this folly or a healthy thing to write out (I'm literally writing out a system in a notebook).

Oh I should probably say that 'Social' is it's own dimension I will need to monitor and it has tie in's with Inner Morale but I haven't worked out how they intersect precisely yet. The gist of it is that I need to make sure I'm socializing a proper amount during my week to generate life satisfaction.",1,1733773718.0,Buddhism,2,1.0,False

While I won't die from eating sugar once or twice, I aim to consume zero sugar and as little non-natural sweeteners as possible everyday because sugar gives me severe migraines. 

I recently made a really good friend and we hang out ALOT. The problem is she has a massive massive sweet tooth. As in ""needs to order a dessert after every meal out"" and ""always seen carrying some sort of cute coloured drink"" level sweet tooth. She also has an insane metabolism and is perfectly healthy which is sooooo disgusting. 

Anyway, I'm getting sick of sitting in restaurants watching her eat a whole slice of cake by herself while I drink a black coffee or a whiskey. And I really want to share in the sweet treats experience with her, which means places that offer normal sugar options alongside, or at least makes stuff that tastes good to everyone, not just diabetics lol 

My dietary requirements:
Non-negotiable - sugar free 
Preferable - natural sweeteners only, unrefined/wholewheat, keto or low carb 

Looking for any sweet treat imaginable, liquid or solid. From all types of cuisines and cultures. Open to try anything. 

But I particularly love French patisserie and desserts (Chou √† la cr√®me and anything involving meringue) 

Bonus points for fun alcoholic drinks or alcohol infused anything. 

Let me know all your go to places and tips + tricks for orders and special requests from the diabetic crowd.

My bf(36) is not interested in working. He has a good-paying full-time job but only because I made him get one after not working for a few months about a year and a half ago. (I literally fixed up his resume and sent it out to places from his e-mail address). And the job he held down before this one was one I got for him. He gets paid a little more than I do now which is just about 6 figures. Which to me is a lot of money. But he just has no desire to work. The only reason he does go in is because I make him. I wake him up and make him coffee and do his laundry and dishes etc. He does miss a lot of work and doesn't get paid when he isn't in. He's lucky we live in a place with tons of jobs and not enough workers so they let it go. But they do often tell him he has to start showing up more. 

He doesn't want to cook or clean. I do most of the manual labour between the two of us. I do almost all the shovelling and I usually change our car oil and tires by myself (although sometimes he helps).
He has expensive habits too. He likes to drink a lot, he gambles, smokes cigarettes, chews tobacco, and eats a lot of junk food. And he's so bad with money. Once he gets paid it's usually gone in 48 hours. He tries to pressure me to give/lend him money too. I sometimes give him money but try not to because I have 2 jobs and take courses in the evenings to always progress my skills/job/hobbies. I have a lot of drive to work, make & save money. I have a lot of goals and I like to get a lot done each day. Plus I don't want my money going to things I think are stupid like cigarettes and gambling. 
When I bring up these issues he says things like he's depressed, and he's sorry, and he wants to be better for me. But he doesn't try to change much. He refuses to try therapy. He spends most of his free time playing video games. I feel like he's only with me to use me for food/money/maid service/etc.

We've been together for almost 10 years now and have 4 frozen embryos together but I don't like the idea of being his mommy for another 30+ years just to have a child of my own. But I do very much want to have a child. I'm 35(f) btw.

A great point he does have is that he is a very loving attentive father of 2 (17 & 12 now). He has for the most part been the only present parent to them. And I would love for him to be the father of my child if I can have one. I love his kids too.

And when we started dating I thought he was a huge winner. That's one of the things I liked most about him. I wanted someone to win with me. Like get things done and acheive our goals together. He came first in everything. He was always winning first place in different sports tournaments, poker touraments, and even got first place in a Call of Duty tournemant. He excels at a lot of things. But lacks interest. In the last 10 years together I've done so much and he's just slightly gotten worse in my opinion. 
He's bilingual. And is great at both languages. I want to raise our kid speaking our heritage language if possible. 
And he has a lot of skills/knowledge that I don't have. He's great at hunting, fishing, and well a lot of outdoorsy things that I like. 
His family is great too. They are large and close. Something I never had with my family. They are very loving and love getting together and are very nice to me. It's nice to be loved and accepted into their family. 
Also he's great in bed. BUT we have way different sex drives. I'm a 2-3 times a week kind of person and he's a 1-2 a month type of person. 

So yeah. Am I hanging on to a mirage of 'what could be'. My therapist suggests I might have a problem with control so maybe I'm trying to control him too much? 
I don't want to take care of a jobless bum though. It might be worth mentioning that I have 2 older brothers who are in my opinion total bums as well. My parents are also retirees that need a lot of help financially. My mom wants me to take over paying my brother's rent when she is gone. So I have multiple man-children to think about already. 

I wonder if I should just end it now and get on with my life or keep him around to be my sperm doner in exchange for being his mommy too. I'm a bit older now so I feel like it's my last chance to have a child of my own but I could always adopt or foster someday by myself or with someone else.. 

Yeah this all sounds stupid to me too. Like I'm a walking wallet for the men in my life. but then I think something like damn maybe I'm just a selfish person who is greedy and doesn't want to help other people and just wants everyone to do what I say. ",1,1733772892.0,venting,2,1.0,False

1hai4yq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dairyfree/comments/1hai4yq/anxiety_gone_my_story/,Anxiety gone - my story,"Just wanted to quickly share my story.

My whole life I had episodes of anxiety and depression. When I started building my muscles (around that time), I started experiencing panic attacks which I blamed on alcohol. I work from home but would get short of breath whenever my turn on the call would come. I wondered what happened - I was much more social and way less risk-averse in my 20s and could not understand what happened in my 30s. Anxiety I experienced was of a general type. Whatever was on my mind - job, health, family, finances would trigger obsessions and anxiety.

I knew there was a problem with milk, yoghurt because everytime I had it, I'd end up with diarrhea and unbeliable gas issue.

I tried meditation, lots of different anti-anxiety meditation with no luck. My anxiety was so random that I did not know what to deal with in terms of working out traumas or childhood events (I don't recall any). I lived in a constant fear of something bad happening - accidents, health whatever.

I quit caffeine thinking that it was the cause of my anxiety which actually helped (because I always drank lattes).


2 weeks ago I got stomach issues and got sick. I had no food for 3 days and weirdly started to feel better than when I was eating. I was so calm, positive. I started introducing food slowly - started with some nuts. Next day - avocado and egg. Then chicken rice. I felt amazing. Then one evening walking back home I got an ice cream. I had only a bit and went to work a bit to finish off some stuff. 15 mins later, I got jittery and my mood just went straight down. I could not believe what just happened, then I thought, what did I just have? Icecream diary..... then I remembered that I always get sick after it anyway. And I wondered why when I met my gf, I was the most depressive period in my life... Relationships not for me? No, I was the cup of ice cream every evening while we had for Netflix 

2 weeks later, I'm a new person. Anxiety gone, I love small talks with strangers, positive. I can had 3 coffees (plain) and get no anxiety. 180 degrees change. All I can say is... Try it for 3-4 days and see yourself ",1,1733772738.0,dairyfree,0,1.0,False
1hai4k8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hai4k8/the_shadow_over_newfoundland/,The shadow over Newfoundland,"It would be a lie to say I grew up wanting to be a priest. My father would take my sisters and me to church every Sunday, whether it was snowing or blisteringly hot, we always went. While my sisters were off finding their husbands, I was growing in the faith and spent more time praying than socializing. However, I was still hesitant when my father told me I should attend a seminary school after graduation. It was not exactly the most thrilling prospect as a seventeen-year-old kid, but after some thought that summer, I decided to give it a shot. It would be the best and worst decision of my life.

Once I was fully ordained, I chose to spread my wings and spread the gospel to those places that had been neglected. After some searching, I settled on a town on the Atlantic coast of Newfoundland called Blythe. It was a small, isolated fishing town whose main claim to fame was the rumored existence of a nearby Viking landing site. I knew it was my calling when I learned that it had previously been host to a catholic church. However, after it burned down in the early 1800s with the priest inside, there was never any attempt to rebuild it.

On my first visit to Blythe, I found the remains of the old church buried deep in the woods outside of town. There was barely anything left besides the cellar and some large logs still blackened by flames. It would be easy to clear the rubble and build my new church atop where the old one once stood.¬†

The locals were leery of me initially since not many outsiders came through their neck of the woods. On this first visit, I tried my best to introduce myself to as many people as possible, but sadly, my trip ended before I could make any real progress. I did, however, get a group of workers to begin constructing the new church before I left.¬†

On my second trip, the locals were more receptive to my presence. Several people approached me, asking about the church, faith, and me personally. Frankly, I wasn‚Äôt expecting this kind of reception after my last visit, but there was one encounter that stood out.¬†

I was visiting the construction site. The sun was getting low and the workers were packing up for the day. Most of the framing had been done and I took great pleasure walking through the hollow interior imagining what it would look like finished. That was when one of the workers approached me.

‚ÄúExcuse me, Father?‚Äù He asked, taking off his hard hat.

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

I would come to find out his name was Johnathan Heathstead. He stood there and scratched his head like he wasn‚Äôt sure what to say next.

‚ÄúDo you‚Ä¶Do you believe in demons?‚Äù He asked.

‚ÄúYes, I sure do.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut do you *believe* in them?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre asking,‚Äù I said.

Johnathan paused for a long second before speaking.

‚ÄúNever mind.‚Äù

At the time, I didn‚Äôt think too much about this interaction. Looking back I should have.¬†

On my third visit, I brought two suitcases and my cat Spots. I was finally moving to Blythe. The church was finished, at least as finished as a church in the backcountry could be. I was proud of it. In fact, I was so excited that I opened the doors to all visitors that first day. I was already greeting nearly two dozen people before I even had a chance to unpack. While that might not seem like many, every pew was filled in that small church.

There was one man, however, who wasn‚Äôt sitting. He was standing in the back watching me as I gave my little sermon and invited the crowd to attend that Sunday‚Äôs mass. After everyone filed out, he approached me.

It was Johnathan. I could hardly recognize him. He looked tired, with dark bags under his eyes and a long, disheveled beard. His clothes looked two sizes too big and it took me a moment to recognize they were the same clothes he was wearing the day I had met him.¬†

‚ÄúFather,‚Äù He croaked, his voice harsh and dry, ‚ÄúDo you have a moment?‚Äù

I paused, unsure how to react.

‚ÄúI need help,‚Äù he said with tears welling in his eyes.

While I was ready to listen to him talk about losing a loved one or going through a nasty divorce, I wasn‚Äôt ready for what he ended up saying. I ushered him to the first row of pews and we sat for a few minutes before he started talking.

‚ÄúFather‚Ä¶Do you believe in the Devil?‚Äù He asked.

‚ÄúYes of course.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you believe he walks among us?‚Äù

‚ÄúSadly I do. He exists in the hearts of men everywhere.‚Äù

Johnathan paused, more tears spilling down his cheeks. I became acutely aware of the smell of fresh lumber at that moment. Strange what you notice in the silence between words.

‚ÄúI believe the Devil has his grip on me,‚Äù he whispered.

‚ÄúWhat makes you think that, my child?‚Äù

Johnathan took a long, steadying breath before he spoke again.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why, but I‚Äôve started to‚Ä¶do things.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat things?‚Äù I pressed.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I black out sometimes. Sometimes only for a few minutes, but other times for whole days. When I wake up‚Ä¶When I wake I‚Ä¶Sometimes I come to and I‚Äôm waist-deep in the ocean on the brink of the abyss. Others‚Ä¶others I am barechested and covered in b-blood. Normally I am outside, on a rock, or up a tree. But, sometimes I am in the basement of my house scribbling like a madman with chalk and blood.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhose blood is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI-I-I don‚Äôt know. Sometimes I swear it is fish blood, others I am not too sure. Our dog went missing a few weeks ago‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

Johnathan broke down. Sobbing into his hands. I noticed they were slightly stained red.¬†

‚ÄúFather, I need help. Please!‚Äù

Now, the Church has had controversy with mental illnesses being conflated with possession, so to say I wasn‚Äôt exactly reaching for my cross and bible over what this man was telling me would be an understatement.¬†

‚ÄúLet me consult with my acquaintances,‚Äù I said, patting him on the back, ‚Äúthey will surely know what the best course of action is.‚Äù

‚ÄúFather, I need help now!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes I know, but I am limited in what I can do right now.‚Äù

Johnathan‚Äôs face immediately sobered up and a flash of rage shined in his eyes. Tears still rolled down his cheeks as he stood up and stormed out of the church.¬†

‚ÄúGo in peace!‚Äù I called out after him, ‚ÄúGod protects all of his children and gives us strength!‚Äù

Johnathan paused halfway through the door and turned back to me.

‚ÄúThen I am no child of God,‚Äù He said before slamming the door shut.

I sat there in the empty church for a while, considering what just happened. My welcome to the town had gone smoothly so far but I was afraid, after how that confession went, that I might not be up to the task. Spots jumped up on my lap and started purring. It put me at ease and the rest of the evening went smoothly.

I had no way of knowing that that night, Johnathan would enter his basement and never emerge again.¬†

It was a closed-casket funeral. A small, intimate affair even though I am sure half the town showed up. It was there that I met Marie, Johnathan‚Äôs widow. A few days after the funeral, I decided to stop by the new widow‚Äôs home. I didn‚Äôt feel it was appropriate to crowd around her at the funeral or to simply ignore her. My motivation wasn‚Äôt entirely altruistic, a selfish part of me wished to wash my hands of the guilt that had weighed on me since I got the news.¬†

When Marie answered the door, it was obvious she‚Äôd been crying. Her eyes were red and puffy and her nose was almost rubbed raw.

‚ÄúGood evening Father, what can I do for you?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúI just wanted to stop by and offer my condolences,‚Äù I said.

She opened her mouth and closed it several times.

‚ÄúWould you like to come in?‚Äù She said, biting back tears, ‚ÄúI would appreciate some guidance.‚Äù

Marie led me inside to a small, two-person dining table in the kitchen.¬†

‚ÄúCoffee?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúThat would be great.‚Äù

Her hands were shaking as she grabbed two mugs from the cupboard.¬†

‚ÄúFather,‚Äù she started, ‚Äúdo you believe in demons?‚Äù

Now, I like to believe I am a rational man, but I would be lying if I said that question didn‚Äôt immediately make me feel sick to my stomach.

‚ÄúYes, of course.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan they make a sane man do what Johnny did?‚Äù She asked, placing the mug of old coffee in front of me before sinking into the opposite chair.

‚ÄúWhat did Johnathan do?‚Äù

‚ÄúI-I don‚Äôt know. He told me he was having nightmares but I didn‚Äôt think they were all that serious. I mean who would? What was I supposed to do?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy child,‚Äù I placed my hand on her wrist, ‚Äúwhat did Johnathan do?‚Äù

Marie wiped at her nose and looked at the basement door.

‚ÄúHe came home late and he was sweating like crazy. I got him water and he seemed to settle down. We went to bed and‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶‚Äù she broke down but quickly composed herself, ‚ÄúI found him down there that morning. The sheriff took his body and some photos but it was clear it was self-inflicted. The door was locked from the inside. He told me I got to be the one to clean it up but I haven‚Äôt opened that door since that morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy, Father, why did this happen?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat should I do?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I sheepishly said.

Marie stood up and walked over to the window.

‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt touched the basement?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNo. No, not yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me help, it‚Äôs the least I can do.‚Äù

Marie led me to the basement door. She didn‚Äôt open it, only nodding towards the doorknob before shuffling back to the dining table.¬†

The door whined as it swung open revealing nothing but a curtain of darkness just past the threshold. I rolled up my sleeves and whispered a quick prayer. Each step creaked as I descended into the darkness. I didn‚Äôt know what to expect but it wasn‚Äôt what was down there.¬†

I pulled on the light cord. It was an unfinished basement with low beam ceilings and concrete floors, a desk was pushed to the side with a rug rolled up and stored on top. It made a clearing in the middle of the basement.¬†

It was Red. Red everywhere. Streaks and drops. Smears across the floors and on the walls. The tinge of rusting iron hung in the air. Among the streaks, there were broken fingernails and scraps of skin, it made me feel weak.

At first, there was no pattern to the madness. Just intersecting lines and circles, hard angles, and jagged scribbling. My head was spinning and I stumbled back to the stairs. I sat for a while, staring at the self-inflicted carnage when it finally started to form.

It was a single, massive rune, or at least something like a rune. It was surprisingly intricate, with large smears making up the border with smaller drops and streaks for finer details. I took several pictures of the rune from every possible angle. I don‚Äôt know what I would do but I felt I needed to document it. It took a few hours to clean up the blood. Even after cleaning the floor was still stained red.¬†

‚ÄúGod be with you,‚Äù I said standing on the house's front step, ‚Äúit always gets better with time.‚Äù

Marie didn‚Äôt say anything as she slowly closed the door.¬†

Several months passed and I had settled into a routine. The buzz around the new church had died down and there was regular attendance during mass. While it wasn‚Äôt the most exciting place to be, Blythe and the surrounding countryside had started to grow on me. With the coming of fall and the changing of leaves, I found myself outside more and more.¬†

The forests behind the church could have well been endless. The locals had carved hiking paths through the trees and several fallen logs made excellent benches. I hadn‚Äôt seen or heard anything about Marie since I visited her house that night. Rumor was that she had secluded herself and was living as a hermit, barely leaving her house. Who could blame her?

Since that night, I haven‚Äôt looked at the photos I took. There was no need to, they were seared into my memory. I thought about that night regularly on my walks through the woods. There was one tree that was my turning point for my walks. It was a massive oak that was likely a remnant of the old-growth forests. I say this as a man of God, I understand why ancient peoples believed these great things to be gods themselves.

It was after one of these hikes that I found a note folded up and slid under the door. It was written in handwriting so heavy it pierced the page a few times. It simply read:¬†

*Help.*

While it was a bit of a stretch, I presumed the note was from Marie. After all, who else would it have been from? She just needed help after Johnathan passed away. Oh how wrong I was. It was getting late but I made the trek out to her house that night. The house sat on the outskirts of town overlooking the ocean.¬†

Once I reached the front door, the sun had already set and the insects had started singing their tunes. I was about to knock when I realized the door was already open.

‚ÄúMrs Heathstead?‚Äù I called out.

Nothing but the darkness of the house answered. The door let out a low creak as I pushed it open.

‚ÄúMrs Heathstead? Are you here?‚ÄùNo response.

I stepped inside, the floorboards moaning under my feet.¬†

‚ÄúMrs Heathstead are you there?‚Äù¬†

I was about to turn back when I heard a faint sobbing coming from the basement. The basement door was slightly ajar, inky darkness on the other side. I took a step closer. The sobbing suddenly stopped.¬†

I heard whispering coming from the basement.

‚ÄúWhat did you say? Mrs. Heathstead?‚Äù

The voice that responded was raspy and almost indiscernibly quiet

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a man at the top of the stairs.‚Äù

I took a step closer, my heart pumping in my ears as the voice spoke again.

‚ÄúAnd another in the basement.‚Äù

Screaming echoed from the basement. The inky darkness was dispelled as orange flames burst from the basement. I fell back, barely avoiding a burst of flames that licked at the place I was just standing. Scrambling to my feet, I barely got out of the doorway before the door slammed shut. By what force I don‚Äôt know.

It was only for the briefest of moments, but for a second I thought something was staring at me from the window. As I blinked the windows exploded in flames sending shards of glass firing in every direction.

The Heathstead house burned down in less than 5 minutes. It took nearly double that for the first men carrying hoses to respond. I stared at the flames, my clothes and hair singed.¬† The flames swirled and licked the night sky.

The Sheriff seemed just as confused and disturbed as I was when I gave my statement. Whether that was because he believed me or didn‚Äôt I don‚Äôt know. I was still an outsider after all. A couple died so soon after I arrived. Even the most trusting man would be suspicious.

It was eventually ruled as self-inflicted. There was no evidence pointing to me and it was clear the fire started in the basement. And, it is easier to believe that a grief-stricken widow would choose to end her pain than for it to be the work of the devil.

I don‚Äôt know what I saw in that window. If I saw anything in that window. I like to believe I am a reasonable man as much as a holy one. But after that night I find myself struggling for answers.

Saul was dead.

Not ‚Äúdied‚Äù, he had been dead for‚Ä¶about a year now?

He had went on this whole thing about finally accepting that he was Jimmy McGill, and apologizing and repenting for the crimes he committed, but that just wasn't good enough for some people!

He was shanked to death by a former client, unhappy with his defense.

He went back to the Goodman persona in hell, probably as a defense mechanism of sorts. But good news!

Good lawyers were very easy to come by down here, for obvious reasons.

His appearance had changed in death, like all sinners.

An lanky anthropomorphic weasel‚Ä¶well, can't say hell didn't have any irony.

Around the afternoon, Saul was in his office. 

Playing desk golf.

‚ÄúOh! Oh! C'mon, c'mon c'mon!‚Äù Saul commented on his own desk golf game. 

The marble sized ball rolled right around the hole‚Ä¶and slid back.

‚Äú...dang it.‚Äù Just then the lawyers phone began to ring.

What in the-

‚ÄúHera! I told you I was busy!‚Äù Saul yelled on the phone.

‚ÄúYeah, well it's important and I didn't want to hear the brat anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you-‚Äù Saul was cut off by a panicking avian voice.

‚ÄúGoodman!? Y-You‚Äôre Saul Goodman!?‚Äù Oh shit-uh-uhhhhh

Now, Saul had fallen deeply into his vices ever since he went to hell. But this reminded him of a better time‚Ä¶when he tried to take moral clients. When he tried to do what was right‚Ä¶when he was working with Chuck.

‚Äú... Alright, alright! Fine! Location, now!‚Äù 

‚ÄúSatan‚Äôs courthouse! It's the big‚Ä¶SATAN‚ÄôS COURTHOUSE!‚Äù

‚ÄúI got it, alright!?‚Äù Saul was immediately pulling up directions to it.

‚ÄúOk! So I don't know the specifics but- mom what the-no! Mom we have to do-‚Äù Octavia‚Äôs phone cut out.

‚Äú...Miss Goetia? ‚Ä¶Great.‚Äù 

Ok. So Saul: 

Did not have any up front pay, or confirmed pay.

Didn't know the charges.

Didn't know anything about the client, except that he was an imp.

He would begin his defense, MID TRIAL.

And-He would be interrupting Satan.

‚Ä¶Saul had this! After all, he did once convince a woman he was Kevin Costner! 

‚Ä¶

‚Äú-Why don't you keep fucking yourself, ya big asshole!‚Äù Bee insulted Mammon, adding in a middle finger for good measure. 

‚ÄúWhy don't we-‚Äù Satan interrupted the bickering Sins, but ended up getting interrupted himself.

The offender swung open the court doors.

‚ÄúSorry! Sorry, everyone! Hey, hi, hello! Oh, lovely outfit there Ozzie! Apologies about my tardiness, but hoo boy! You would not BELIEVE what the roads are like. I expected the fire, but the traffic is the real hell. Am I right?‚Äù Saul Goodman ladies and gentlemen! 

He wore a Cyan suit, with a lovely green tie. He carried a dark brown briefcase with him, filled with various random papers from his office.

Upon opening the doors, he simply fast walked in. Giving a wink or point at the people in the stands. Upon reaching the defense desk he placed his suitcase on the table and began shuffling papers, giving an aura of actually knowing what the fuck was going on.

‚ÄúWho the-WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU!?‚Äù Satan slammed his fist on the ground by his side and growled at this fool who DARED to interrupt HIM!

Even for a man who had died before, Saul was shaken. 

‚ÄúHey umm-uhh yeah, do you mind if I just butt in here? Hey Satan! How about we take a deep breath, and go to our happy place.‚Äù Yogirt calmed Satan, being one of the only people allowed to do something like this.

‚ÄúWHY THE-...Yeah, yeah happy place.‚Äù Satan took a deep breath‚Ä¶he did literally hire the Yogi, and it meant nothing if he never did what he said. 

Saul had taken some deep breaths, and resumed his air of understanding. Wasn't the first time something like this had happened, the trick was to remain calm and confident. If you give them a hand, they'll take the whole arm.

‚ÄúSaul Goodman, Attorney at Law of ‚ÄúGoodman and Associates‚Äù! This is my client, and this is thereby my trial! Now on that note, why the hell are they gagged and bound?‚Äù Satan breathed deeply. Saul had the edge here, he could feel it.

‚ÄúThey were being mouthy.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMouthy? As in they were talking? What else are they supposed to be doing, your honor?‚Äù Satan breathed deep again. Happy place‚Ä¶happy place‚Ä¶

‚ÄúI would like to respectfully ask that the gag‚Äôs are removed, so that my clients may have a fair chance.‚Äù ‚Ä¶damn it, this lawyer was good.

With a snap of his fingers, the gag's came off.

‚ÄúFucking finally!‚Äù Blitz yelled out in anger.

‚ÄúYeah! Fucking finally!‚Äù Loona yelled the same, as Saul put his finger up.

‚ÄúCould-Could you both just let me handle this?‚Äù Without waiting for a response he continued ‚ÄúThank you, thank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, your honor. Now I wish to know the exact crimes that my client is being accused of.‚Äù Goodman inquired.

‚ÄúAssault, robbery, attempted murder, and traversing the mortal realm without proper credentials.‚Äù ‚Ä¶Oh.

Ooohhh‚Ä¶

Ohhhh this was bad.

‚ÄúWell, that is-‚Äù

‚ÄúAll of these crimes were committed against a Ars Goetia.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo it fuckin-‚Äù Blitz was shushed by Saul.

‚ÄúJust shut up and let your lawyer talk okay? Okay. Your honor, where is the accuser?‚Äù Andrealphus spoke up here.

‚ÄúI am speaking on their behalf, due to their lack of presence here today. It would be invariably damaging to his mental health to have to face this VILE DISGUSTING imp who ABUSED him!‚Äù Andrelphus played it up.

‚ÄúYour honor that's conjecture!‚Äù Saul stood up and objected to this.

‚ÄúYeah! He's fucking right! Whatever that is!‚Äù Blitz flipped off Andrealphus, not helping his case at all.

Satan rubbed the bridge of his snout. The fun part of these trials was the punishment and power, not legal mumbo jumbo! 

‚ÄúSi! This entire trial so far has been a mont√≥n de mierda! Hell, Stolas isn't even here! Or Stella!‚Äù Vassago ranted, and Saul perked up.

‚ÄúWait a minute, if I'm hearing this correctly the accuser is not present? And the accuser is accusing on behalf of the victim? Your honor there are far too many degrees of separation here to conduct a fair trail.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my Lucifer‚Ä¶okay. What do YOU suggest that WE do?‚Äù Satan was barely hanging onto his calm facade. Yogirt was rubbing his shoulder, trying to keep the big man relaxed.

‚ÄúI believe that a recess is in order. You keep the accused in custody, and we reconvene in‚Ä¶a week?‚Äù Saul shrugged.

‚ÄúThree Days. Three days and we have our final verdict. Am. I. Clear?‚Äù 

‚ÄúThree days! Perfect your honor! Thank you so much!‚Äù Saul bowed, the ball was in his court here. 

People sighed at having to continue this stupid trial, and Saul went to his clients.

‚Ä¶

Later, in an interrogation room.

‚ÄúAlright, so thanks for helping‚Ä¶I guess? But why the-‚Äù Saul cut him off.

‚ÄúErr! Let's pump the brakes here, alright? First of all, my payment.‚Äù He took out a pen and business card. 

‚ÄúFor a case of this magnitude, you're gonna have to pay for premium. $500,879. I'll write it down on the back of the card so you don't forget, Five Zero Zero Eight Seven Nine. Then you'll call your boyfriend or husband or ex or whatever the prince is to you, and have him write it out to ‚ÄúIce Station Zebra Associates‚Äù, that's my loan out totally legit. Money order please, and then we can discuss Sinza or Mammoncard. But not Greed Express, so don't even try.‚Äù Saul knew this whole spiel by heart. The only difference was the numbers, and in this case the credit cards.

Before he could continue, the door once again burst open. Why was there so much door interrupting going on?

‚ÄúBlitzyyyy!‚Äù Stolas ran in and hugged the imp.

‚ÄúWhy the-are you okay!?‚Äù Blitz rolled his eyes and feigned uncare.

‚ÄúYeah, yeah, I'm fine‚Ä¶just that your asshole brother in law is effing everything up.‚Äù Blitz bemoaned.

Before he could continue, Saul interrupted the on and off again lovers.

‚ÄúOh, so you're Stolas? ‚Ä¶Thought you would have been taller.‚Äù Saul then gave the same spiel he gave Blitz, and tucked the business card in Stolas‚Äôs cape necklace thing. ‚ÄúNow, assuming you don't want to be beheaded or whatever other form of execution the big fella‚Äôs thinking, you have to tell me EXACTLY what happened.‚Äù 

So, after a lengthy explanation, Saul sighed and face palmed.

‚Äú...whew‚Ä¶alright we are-we are not in a good spot here. Okay?‚Äù Saul almost defensively put his hands up.

‚ÄúBut let me tell you this. You are going to get the best criminal, criminal defense attorney money can buy. Alright?‚Äù Saul packed up his things.

‚ÄúYou three-‚Äù He pointed at M&M and Loona. ‚ÄúAre gonna be fine. I'll send a email to Satan right when I get outta here, he won't wanna do extra paperwork. Now me, the boss, and the bird are gonna meet here right after morning chow to discuss a battle plan and strategy. Alright?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat!? I'm not staying in this damn joint all night! I'm busting outta here fucking AS-fucking-AP Bitch!‚Äù Blitz protested.

‚ÄúHuh. Aren't you classy? Well too bad, because I need time to talk to my people and get things ordered together. Alright? Look, I'm a lawyer okay? A GOOD lawyer taking this case with ZERO knowledge of what's going on. If bird brain‚Äôs kid here didn't call me, I'd be reheating last night‚Äôs casserole by now. Sit down, stay quiet, and try not to shank anyone in the chow line alright?‚Äù 

‚ÄúHell-No! Busted outta a joint before, I can do it again.‚Äù

‚ÄúUgh, Blitz! Just-Please? For me?‚Äù Loona pleaded.

‚Äú...Fffffffffffucking fine.‚Äù Blitz shrugged, and got escorted out by the guards. Saul‚Äôs email went through, and the other members of IMP were let go.

While Saul was walking down the steps of the courthouse, Stolas huddled with him.

‚ÄúLook, Mr Goodman? I-I have an idea okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright? Shoot.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon't these things have like‚Ä¶plea deals?‚Äù Stolas remembered a scene in his Hell-o-Novella.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶yes but-!‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat if I confess in exchange for immunity for him?‚Äù Saul put his hand up dismissively.

‚ÄúNot a chance. First off, only reason I took this failure of a case is cause your daughter has a convincing voice. You think she'll be happy that her dad is a prison wife to Buffalo fricken Bill? Second off, if you get canned where am I gonna get my pay? Not from Mr Assassin, I can tell ya that much!‚Äù 

‚Ä¶

Saul, Blitz, and Stolas sat in the interrogation room. 

‚ÄúHey there, Andy. How's jail been, huh?‚Äù Saul asked Blitz, making a reference the convict didn't understand. 

‚ÄúShitty, how do you think?‚Äù Blitz made the obvious known. He was understandably unhappy at his brand new Orange Wardrobe, and at the cuffs on his wrists.

‚ÄúYeah, well my chi ain't exactly flowing either. Okay, so you cash that check yet eh princy?‚Äù 

Stolas stiffened, and rubbed his right arm.

‚ÄúI uhh‚Ä¶don't‚Ä¶have the money.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Saul interrogated.

‚ÄúI do not have the money.‚Äù Stolas finished.

Saul threw his hands up.

‚ÄúReally‚Ä¶Welp, we're done for then.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat? No, no! You-Didn‚Äôt you promise Octavia you'd do this!? I-I can pay you with my stuff!‚Äù Blitz hated being forced to beg, but he wasn't crazy about execution either. 

‚ÄúThis isn't just about feeding my greed, alright? I got guys to pay, overhead. We don't get the money, we don't have much of a chance!‚Äù Saul explained.

‚ÄúIt's with my ex wife, so-so it's not gone!‚Äù Stolas hung on to the only life line he had here. 

‚ÄúJust-Just right now. How much do you have on you?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶the only income I still get is the $5000 monthly allowance from my father‚Ä¶‚Äù No way.

‚ÄúBut uhh‚Ä¶after paying all my things‚Ä¶rent, food, employee salaries‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHow. Much?‚Äù Saul demanded, and Stolas took a deep breath.

‚ÄúAt the end, I have $327 dollars left for luxuries.‚Äù Saul threw his hands back.

‚ÄúOh, okay then! So we're fucked!‚Äù Blitz bemoaned. 

At most, if he spent all of IMP‚Äôs budget and managed to sell all those collectible plates at full price he'd still only be at like‚Ä¶not enough. What? Moxxie was the one who did numbers!

‚ÄúAhh that's just‚Ä¶great. This case just keeps getting better and better, huh? Alright, so how much does your ex wife have?‚Äù 

‚ÄúAt least $2 million, Mr Goodman.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAlright, so we gotta get the cash from your wife‚Ä¶and that's not even mentioning the other issues. Stella and Andrealphus‚Äôs interviews came in. Both claim that they saw you acting nervous and a lot shakier this past year, when the divorce happened she began noticing you with bruises and cuts which you claimed happened from falling down the stairs, finally she claims that she saw Blitz beating Stolas on the 18th, and immediately called Andrelphus. The phone records might have been altered, but nevertheless they show a 17 minute call from Stella‚Äôs phone to his. 4:00 to 4:17.‚Äù Stolas paled, and Blitz slammed his head into the table.

‚ÄúGreat. I'm getting executed. Saul, you need to make sure all my stuff goes to Loona.‚Äù Stolas spoke now.

‚ÄúOh just‚Ä¶just shut up, okay!? That's not how will‚Äôs work, and we are NOT going to give up that easily!‚Äù Stolas scolded his boyfriend as the imps head hung low. 

‚ÄúWhat he said. I gotta plan‚Ä¶‚Äù Saul huddled with his clients, and began to explain one of the greatest schemes Slippy Jimmy's concocted.

‚Ä¶

Striker missed his cave hide out. 

He was having to live in a small adobe shack on the outskirts of wrath. 

At the very least, it had cable so he could watch his westerns and a stable for Bombproof. 

He sighed as he walked outside.

‚ÄúOhhh Bombproof~! Who wants a tasty cactus fruit with no Benadryl in it~?‚Äù Bombproof wanted the tasty cactus fruit with no Benadryl in it! 

But.

The tasty cactus fruit he chewed on and swallowed, did in fact have Benadryl in it.

Striker hated having to do this, but Bombproof gave him no choice but to do so. It was the only way Striker could administer a shot.

But, his phone rang. The cowboy checked the caller id, unknown.

He answered it.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes? Hello? Is this Striker?‚Äù A greasy voice spilled out of the phone.

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶how you know my name?‚Äù 

‚ÄúThis is uhh, Gene Takovic at B.N.M? Well, first of all I just wanna say I am so sorry for your loss.‚Äù

Striker was confused. He hadn't had anyone close to him die recently‚Ä¶just a benefit of not being close to people.

‚ÄúWhat? Ain't no one died near me.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? Your great uncle Earl?‚Äù 

‚ÄúMy who? I don't have a great uncle. Or know anyone named Earl. Ain't got no family no more.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh really? I just-assumed you and him were close. Well, anyway his estate's in your name now. You're his last living relative.‚Äù 

That caught Striker's attention.

‚ÄúReally now? Well, ain't that something.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I sent the $250 or so dollars to you already.‚Äù 

Ah. So that's what that package was. Striker just thought it was a tip from a client or something.

‚ÄúGot it. Was that all?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo, uhh there is a small issue at hand. Just some issues with changing hands and all. We just have a few security questions for you, nothing personal.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, shoot!‚Äù

The lawyer asked Striker the question‚Äôs. What was his Email, his Password, mother's maiden name, all that stuff.

‚ÄúThat it?‚Äù

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúYes. Thank you very much sir, we‚Äôll send you a check ASAP.‚Äù Saul hung up the phone.

Goodman looked across his desk at Mike. 

Mike was a sinner demon. By death, he had turned into a rhinoceros with facial hair made of cattails.

‚ÄúAlright, where did you want the meet again?‚Äù Saul asked his private eye. 

‚Ä¶

Stella was pissed. 

Granted she was usually pissed, but now it was worse. 

First her Husband isn't executed, then she has to spend an hour getting coached by Andrealphus on what to say in the interview, and then she had to actually do the interview!

This was all bullshit!

Unfair, stupid, bullshit! 

Oh, and to top it all off!? Striker just HAS to have a meeting immediately!

And it can't be over the phone, can't be at any good coffee shop, it HAD to be this ratty motel! 

Her anger was interrupted by a knock on the door. 

She waited for a butler to open the door as there was another knock.

‚Ä¶Oh yeah, she was alone here.

She sighed loudly, and went to open the door. Letting the cowboy in.

Wait no, that's not striker. That's some Rhino.

‚ÄúWhat in Lucifer's-‚Äù But Mike already pushed his way in, shutting the door behind him.

‚ÄúWho the hell are you!?‚Äù Stella was somehow even more pissed off. 

‚ÄúThat doesn't matter. Here's what‚Äôs gonna happen. You're gonna reach in ya cummerbund, and take out your checkbook.‚Äù Ehermantraut ordered before Stella laughed.

‚ÄúOh! That's a good one. I bet Andrelphus hired you. You can go now.‚Äù Stella shooed with her hands. Even Mike was taken aback at her cluelessness.

‚ÄúNot a performer. Here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna reach in your cummerbund, left side, and take out your checkbook. I saw you take the checkbook out 12 minutes ago to buy those earrings.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHow fucking dare you! You stalker son of a bitch!‚Äù Stella picked up a lamp and was about to chuck it at Mike.

‚ÄúYou're not gonna do that. Considering that this room was prepaid, you have not interacted with any staff so far and there is zero proof that you were ever here. Adding onto that if you throw that, you will have to write a check to pay for it. Otherwise, you will be tried under vandalism. Same thing with if you kill me.‚Äù Mike knew how to deal with spoiled brats. The trick was to remain firm and constant.

‚ÄúAn Ars Goetia should not be found in a seedy place like this. If you throw that, attack me, or kill me, then you will be forced to explain why you were here to everyone. Exposing your scheme. Understand?‚Äù Stella was shocked and taken aback, dropping the lamp on the bed.

‚ÄúThat's-That‚Äôs not fair!‚Äù She hung to one of her only lifelines.

‚ÄúIt is. Now you're going to take out your checkbook.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut-But-‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are going to take out your checkbook.‚Äù 

Stella huffed. She didn't have a choice‚Ä¶one of the only times in her life where yelling, hitting and screaming wouldn't solve anything.

She slowly took out her checkbook‚Ä¶

‚ÄúNow you are going to write out a check. $500,879. That's Five, Zero, Zero, Eight, Seven, Nine. Made payable to Stolas Ars Goetia.‚Äù Stella halted her pen.

‚ÄúThat-That damn Imp fucking bastard!? Like hell I'm giving anything to him! He is a idiotic crybaby adulterer! He-He is loud and annoying and he just cries like ALL the time! Oh and he sings these just horrible songs! The tone deaf idiot! He is a imp fucking, lower class roaming, disgusting, wimpy, failure of a man and person!‚Äù 

‚ÄúHmph. Is that so? Well, you're gonna continue writing that check. Five, Zero, Zero, Eight, Seven, Nine. Made payable to Stolas Ars Goetia. Need me to spell it for ya?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo I-I will call Andrelphus when I'm out of here! Yes! Mhhm! He-He‚Äôll find you!‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou don't know my residence, you don't know my occupation, you don't even know my name. Besides, do you really wanna get chewed out by him?‚Äù 

No! No that was‚Ä¶Stella was backed in a corner‚Ä¶

‚ÄúThere we go‚Ä¶Thank you.‚Äù Mike took the check out of her hands and walked to the door.

‚ÄúOh, and by the way. If this check bounces, or doesn't go through? We're gonna have another talk. And I don't think you want that, do you?‚Äù 

‚Ä¶

Great. Andrealphus‚Äôs day was just going perfect. Yesterday Stella spends $500,000 dollars on jewelry, and the day before that he had to spend HOURS coaching Stella on what to say in the interview!

Now, Stolas call‚Äôs him and he just HAS to talk in person. This tea had BETTER be good. Oh who was he kidding? Pringles made some damn fine scones. Especially with that Cinnamon glaze‚Ä¶mmm‚Ä¶

‚ÄúHold on a second sir.‚Äù A rhinoceros sinner demon by the Castle‚Äôs front doors held up and hand and stopped him.

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù Andrelphus said, almost aghast at this tomfoolery.

‚ÄúI'm the new security consultant. Everyone who's not Octavia Ars Goetia, or Stolas Ars Goetia are to be searched.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat? I'm Andrelphus Ars Goetia. Stolas‚Äôs brother in law? Octavia's Uncle? I should be allowed in.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry sir. Only two people allowed in without a search are Octavia and Stolas Ars Goetia.‚Äù

‚ÄúUghhhhhhhhhhghghghhhhhhhhhhhhghhhhhhhhhghhhhhhhh!‚Äù Andrelphus drew out his annoyed groan and began opening his pockets.

He didn't have many pockets, so he also carried around a purse. It was a dark blue leather, with a snowflake design at the top.

The security consultant looked everything over, opening the purse and picking up some items in the process.

‚ÄúAlright, sorry about this sir.‚Äù He handed everything back to the Goetia. 

‚ÄúYou better be.‚Äù Andrelphus yanked his items back, and went to go talk to Stolas.

When he arrived on the patio, Stolas happily poured him a cup of tea and handed him one of those heavenly scones.

‚ÄúAndre! So glad to see you.‚Äù The Jack Frost wannabe took his own seat with a scowl.

‚ÄúConsidering that we are currently at odds, your graciousness is more than a little suspicious.‚Äù Stolas waved his hand.

‚ÄúOh, it's all just water under the bridge as far as I'm concerned! I was just uhh, wondering if I could talk to you about colleges for Octavia?‚Äù This peaked Andre‚Äôs interest.

There was not much he loved more than having his ego stroked, and having Stolas come to him for expertise? That was great. After all, Andrelphus‚Äôs branch of the family had been alumni and donors to several of the most prestigious colleges in all the seven rings.

‚ÄúWell now! Isn't that interesting‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Ä¶

Right when Andrelphus was out of sight, Mike took the planner he stole and walked to a nearby trash can. 

‚ÄúGot it Goodman. Time to get to work.‚Äù Said Lawyer began to rise out of his hiding spot.

‚ÄúYeah, yeah, oww‚Ä¶it's my knees alright? Making a man with bad knees hide in the garbage, I'm not charging these people enough.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou got your check, and I got my money. Now get to work.‚Äù Saul took the tracing paper and pencil out of his pockets.

‚ÄúI'm working on it! Whew, Miss Cawolski‚Äôs 2nd period art don't fail me now!‚Äù Saul first opened the planner to the 18th, seeing it was blank. This meant that Andrelphus‚Äôs story checked out‚Ä¶

Saul then began to go through the planner, placing the tracing paper over the letters and numbers he needed to copy. 

When it was all said and done, it was said that on the 18th a dinner party was held at Stolas‚Äôs Mansion. At exactly the time the call was supposed to take place. 

And it said this, in the bird‚Äôs own hand writing.

In fact, Saul finished it just in time to pass it to Pringles.

When Andrelphus got tired of his ego being pumped full of hot air, said butler then took Andrealphus bag to carry, and slipped the planner back in.

‚Ä¶

Satan‚Äôs courthouse, Pride Ring. Mid afternoon, 

This would be the trial that decided the fate of Blitz√∏ Buckzo.

There was a dark air in the room, and the only conversation‚Äôs held were hushed. 

Stolas was present today, and so was Octavia. Both in the Goetia‚Äôs section.

Satan sighed. He hated when a trial had to be an actual trial.

‚ÄúAll rise for the trial of Blitz√∏ Buckzo V Ars Goetia. Oh also, this had better be quick.‚Äù Satan sat down, and Andrelphus stood up. 

‚ÄúOn behalf of my, beautiful, sister. I accuse that DIRTY imp of abusing, harming, stealing from, and attempting to kill my brother in law! As well as traversing the Mortal realm without any proper cause!‚Äù He yelled with a point.

‚ÄúWe already had the assassin come forth, right? So I mean, what's even the point anymore huh?‚Äù Mammon said, getting a chorus of agreement.

‚ÄúWell-I would say that you should hold that thought, sir.‚Äù Saul held up a finger, silencing the crowd.

‚ÄúIf I may, your honor, I would like to call the Assassin to the stand.‚Äù With a huff Satan honored his request, and Striker was brought up. 

Striker realized that Saul and Gene were the same, and snarled at his own lack of foresight. His own greed did tend to blind the cowboy.

He'd shoot Saul. Not now, but definitely in the near future. Or stab him.

‚ÄúMr Striker, around 29 minutes ago a dear friend of mine shook your hand.‚Äù Striker remembered the elder who he talked about horses with outside the courthouse.

‚ÄúYeah? So what? I ain't allowed to meet people?‚Äù Striker shrugged.

‚ÄúHe noticed a ink smudge on his hand after shaking yours.‚Äù Andrelphus stood up aghast.

‚ÄúSo!? He probably just got it on his hand before he even met him!‚Äù Andrealphus defended.

‚ÄúWell, then why don't you just raise your hands Mr Striker?‚Äù Saul countered.

‚Äú...No.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh? Why is that?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI uhh‚Ä¶I gotta-a thing about it. Childhood trauma, you know?‚Äù Striker sheepishly shrugged, looking for any form of defense. In response, Saul changed his assault tactic.

‚ÄúPhew! You, my friend, have a lot more guts than I. Not many people would be willing to lie to Satan in front of his face!‚Äù Thankfully, Satan took the bait Saul layed. 

‚ÄúOh my Lucifer-JUST RAISE YOUR FUCKING HANDS!‚Äù Now Striker was a rebel. He had always been a rebel. But when Satan himself tells you to do something, you don't really have a choice. 

With a groan, Striker raised his hands. Revealing the notes Andrelphus had him scrawl on his hands.

‚ÄúHah! Sins and Goetia, I think you can see that it is obviously plain that this witness was tampered with! As his testimony is the only thing connecting my client to the attempted murder of Stolas, and the theft of the grimoire and it's usage, I ask that these 3 charges be thrown out!‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah bitch! How you like them apples you cloaca having fuck face!?‚Äù Blitz said, in Andrelphus's direction, cussing as much as he always did.

‚ÄúReally? I just filed all the‚Ä¶I suppose that all makes sense. But there's still the assault charge.‚Äù Satan waved his hand while waiving the charges.

With this decision, Saul had already talked Satan down from the death penalty to at most 50 years. 

‚ÄúYeahhhhh! Daddy's coming home baby!‚Äù It was unclear if Blitz was yelling to Stolas or Loona. Though both shared the same expression of embarrassment.

Saul debated asking for the gag to be put back on Blitz. But decided against it helping his case.

‚ÄúHeh, what a wordsmith huh folks?‚Äù Saul appealed to the crowd. 

‚ÄúDo any of you see this!? With how VILE, RUDE and CRASS this imp speaks how can he be anything BUT an abuser!?‚Äù Andrelphus was grasping at straws here, and it failed miserably. 

‚ÄúThe fuck are you talking about?‚Äù Satan asked.

‚ÄúSi, ¬øqu√© carajo?‚Äù Vassago swore in his native tounge.

Right before Blitz was about to unleash his own stream of obscenities Saul put his hand over his mouth.

‚ÄúJust-Just shut up and let me handle this! Eww, why'd you lick me!?‚Äù Saul pulled his hand back, wiping it on his suit. 

‚ÄúOkay, so uhh‚Ä¶50 years? Yeah? That f-‚Äù Satan tried to deliver a verdict.

‚ÄúWe have more to say your honor!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my-Fine!‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, your honor. We would like to call to the stand, Andrealphus himself!‚Äù Said Goetia was aghast! 

‚ÄúWhat!? You-That is not allowed!‚Äù 

‚ÄúI'm uhh, I'm pretty sure it is.‚Äù Satan spoke.

‚ÄúWell it-it shouldn't be! This compromises the integrity of the trial because it uhh‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúGET ON THE FUCKING STAND!‚Äù Yogirt had to come in again.

‚ÄúHey Satan, remember to ground yourself~! You know, ‚Äútwo feet on the floor‚Äù?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah, yeah.‚Äù The frosty prince was brought up. He would have been sweating, but it probably froze.

‚ÄúSo, Andrealphus. When exactly did Stella call you again?‚Äù

‚ÄúOn-On the 18th. It was around 4? I had just finished chapter 8 of ‚ÄúThe collected history and Anthology of Ice Spells (Vol 19)‚Äù. It was the chapter about, I think, making weapons frosted?‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, ok‚Ä¶do you have a PDA? Or some other way of marking your schedule?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. I always tend to have my planner with me.‚Äù

‚ÄúCould you please open it to the 18th, and show it to us?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes. I-‚Äù Andrealphus took it out, and opened it to the 18th before stopping abruptly.

This-This was all wrong! He wasn't anywhere on the 18th! Sure he didn't get a call, but he was home all day!

‚ÄúMr Andrelphus? Could you please show it to us?‚Äù Saul continued, his scheme succeeding.

‚ÄúI-I-‚Äù 

‚ÄúJUST SHOW THE DAMN THING!‚Äù Almost all the sins said in unison. Not Satan though. He was finding his happy place. And not Lucifer. He was busy making duckies.

Slowly, Andrelphus brought up the planner‚Ä¶clear as day, in his own handwriting, it read ‚ÄúDinner Party at Stolas's Mansion. 3:00 pm-6:00 pm.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell-I didn't feel well that day so I didn't-‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh shut up, you were there!‚Äù Stolas yelled out with a point. A bit dramatic, but Mike coached them well.

‚ÄúYeah! I was also there! He ate like, 7 scones.‚Äù Vassago added.

‚ÄúProbably forgot it because of how much he drank‚Ä¶you got really drunk uncle Andre.‚Äù Octavia added her own section to the script, but it worked.

‚ÄúI didn't do a thing!‚Äù Andrelphus slammed his hands slammed his hands on the stand, ice emanating from the strike.

‚ÄúThere wasn't any party! I wasn't there! I didn't eat any scones, and I certainly didn't get drunk! I didn't write this in my planner! Some-Someone else did! This is-it was a spell! It must have been! I'd never get that drunk! You all know I wouldn't get blackout drunk! I've never done it before! This is all-this is a conspiracy! I won't stand for it! This-this chicanery!‚Äù Andrelphus's freak out ended with another desk slam. His pupils had shown and snow fell around him. 

‚ÄúDamn‚Ä¶‚Äù Loona was aghast.

‚ÄúOh my Lucifer‚Ä¶‚Äù Beelzebub was also surprised. 

Seeing a prim and proper man like him lose it was always a strange sight.

‚ÄúI-I mean‚Ä¶what I meant to say was-‚Äù Satan cut him off.

‚ÄúGreat. So now it's revealed that this ENTIRE THING HAS BEEN A IDOTIC WASTE OF MY TIME!‚Äù Satan slammed his fists down, lava splashing where he hit.

‚ÄúIF YOU EVER ATTEMPT TO PLAY ME LIKE THAT AGAIN, I WILL BURN YOU TO A CRISP AND GRIND ANYTHING THAT REMAINS INTO YOUR SISTER'S FACE!‚Äù 

‚ÄúY-Yes sir! I am-I don't know what-‚Äù 

‚ÄúBlitzo Buckzo is freed from any and all charges! But you had BETTER NOT SHOW UP HERE AGAIN!‚Äù Satan got down near him, snorting out steam. Saul wasn't afraid. It was like he was looking through the devil.

‚ÄúYes sir! You won't ever see me again!‚Äù Blitz smiled as Stolas and Loona ran over and hugged him. Millie and Moxxie followed soon after.

‚ÄúThank you Goodman. I-...He wouldn't have been okay without you.‚Äù Octavia told the lawyer, who remained still.

‚ÄúYes, thank you very much Mr Goodman.‚Äù Stolas bowed, showing his father's teaching held no meaning.

‚ÄúSaul, you get a permanent 50% discount on any IMP assassinations! ...Goodman? GOODMAN!‚Äù At Blitz‚Äôs yelling, Saul finally got out of his mind fog.

‚ÄúHuh? Oh, oh yeah we won‚Ä¶hooray.‚Äù Jimmy straightened his tie.

‚ÄúYep, told ya you'd get your money's worth! I-I uhh‚Ä¶got-got business to be doing.‚Äù He handed out business cards to everyone around him. 

‚ÄúRemember, D.U.I? Sue? Anything? You get locked in jail, you ‚ÄúBetter Call Saul‚Äù!‚Äù Saul posed with a point. The memories of Chuck being buried again.

Saul then left the courthouse, brushing off any thanks, Andrelphus's threats, and Mike's debrief.

Saul walked back to his apartment, a seedy place in the entertainment district of Pentagram City. 

He chose this because it was close to a lot of potential clients, including the Vee‚Äôs.

He walked into the apartment, tossing off his jacket and pouring a whisky.

He turned on the TV, watching some random show. He saw one of his own commercials.

When it finished, he paused and rewinded. 

As he rewatched the commercial, he realized why he helped that girl.

It felt like he was redeeming himself. Saving another family.

It made Saul feel ok again‚Ä¶no.

It made Jimmy feel ok again. For a second, he forgot.

1hahvkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1hahvkk/my_girlfriend_does_not_want_me_drinking_at_all/,My girlfriend does not want me drinking at all. ,"My girlfriend and I have lived together for almost 2 years. Over that time, she‚Äôs brought over her three younger siblings one by one to live with us, because her parents are very toxic/abusive. I agreed to this although I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be ideal. They were 16, 17, and 18 at the times they each came to live with us. My girlfriend and I are 21 and 24, respectively. 

I graduated college at 20 and have been working for almost 3 years in a stressful office job, making good money. I pay most of the bills (my gf works a couple nights a week) and it‚Äôs tough sometimes I‚Äôm not going to lie. The siblings weren‚Äôt raised with the best role models and are often rude to me, although I think they do it without thinking. I do not like the city where I live and the only reason why I am still here is my girlfriend. On top of this I have for a long while believed myself to be some sort of neurodivergent, probably ADHD. Stimulants or depressants of any kind immediately have me feeling more stable and so I‚Äôve been medicating with coffee and alcohol for a few years. I know it‚Äôs not the healthiest or safest way to do this but it works fairly well for me. When my girlfriend met me I drank much more, but she got me down to 1-2 days a week pretty easily. My safe place is feeling comfortable in my own home and right now that is difficult, considering I don‚Äôt want to live in this town even. At my age I want to start experiencing other places with my girlfriend and start working up, FOMO is eating me alive. 

Recently my girlfriend has told me she doesn‚Äôt want me drinking at all, and when I asked her why she said it‚Äôs because she feels scared and alone when I do drink, because it feels like a different me. This was a surprise to me because I‚Äôm not sure how I could be scaring her, I‚Äôve never raised a hand against her (she‚Äôs hit me before though) and given her no indication that I would. She also has no bad history with alcohol, her parents never drank. When I drink I love to listen to music, read, play video games, or watch a movie. I am at my most passive when I drink and always invite her to be with me. As for being alone, SHE is the one who brought almost her whole family to the house, people that I don‚Äôt particularly care for. I feel like I am entitled to my safe place and a little booze to block out some of the negativity that life in general is filled with. She admits that my relationship with alcohol has gotten better, but last Sunday night, after spending the rest of the weekend taking her on dates and spending time with her, I asked if I could get some beers since I was feeling a little overwhelmed and wanted to relax before work in the morning. She said flat out no and that‚Äôs when i started feeling how unfair this was. If I ever bring up how I am not the happiest in this situation she tells me immediately just to leave if I am unhappy. I feel like drinking some nights should be a good middle ground but she does not seem to think so. 

What do you think? Does alcohol really hurt my partner or is she being overly controlling about something that shouldn‚Äôt be an issue? ",5,1733772094.0,LifeAdvice,19,1.0,False

He gave me his real name which made me suspicious because why he would give me his name so quick? He said he trusted me but he didn‚Äôt even see me. Anyways, he stopped texting me for a while and then i thought he doesn‚Äôt want to meet anymore. 

He lives in another city which is 2 hours with car and today he suddenly said he is in my city and staying at a hotel tonight. I suggested to meet for coffee tomorrow but he asked if I‚Äôd like to get dinner tonight. I will go meet him tonight at his hotel‚Äôs restaurant but I‚Äôm a bit scared, what if he is a human trafficker or something. I will just meet for the dinner and not go to his room even though he suggested to eat there, but I declined. 

And he asked me to stay over for few days without even meeting first which gave me big red flag. But I will meet and see tonight I guess.

I'm not a sophisticated reviewer, so no notes of fruits etc., but a bare bones review.

I recently saw the Tamdhu Quercus Alba Distinction Batch 02, and thought that Tamdhu probably got it right (like with the rest of their range, which is quite good), and bought it. It's also at 48%, so should be better (so I thought).

So I opened it, and here is what I found (I tried it straight upon opening, and again at 3/4 full):

Nose: Very good, smells like a strong sherried whiskey (think Glendronach 12).

Taste: Cheap slightly-sweetened room-temperature vodka. All you taste is the ethanol with some sweetness.

Throat Burn: High. The same vodka notes.

Aftertaste: If you wait long enough, until the alcohol evaporates, then you get some sweetness.

However, once it's mixed in (into coffee, my favorite mixer), then it shines through quite nicely. Suddenly you taste much more of the quality of the whiskey.

Every week for the past three years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...
___
**STAT OF THE WEEK:** According to¬†Amazon Web Services: ‚ÄúToday, developers report they spend an average of just one hour per day coding. They spend most of their time on tedious, undifferentiated tasks such as learning codebases, writing and reviewing documentation, testing, managing deployments, troubleshooting issues or finding and fixing vulnerabilities.‚Äù I can definitely relate to that one! Sometimes writing the actual code is the easy / quick part. It's like that old story about the electrician who charged $2,000 for a minute of his time. With coding, it's all the work that goes into knowing what to write for that hour.
___
A three-judge panel in Washington, D.C. unanimously upheld the new US law last week that will require **TikTok** to divest to an American owned company or face a ban, ruling that the law did not violate free speech protections under the First Amendment. Today (Dec 9th), ByteDance and TikTok filed an emergency motion with the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, requesting a temporary halt to the law's enforcement pending Supreme Court review. The timeline for the Supreme Court to decide whether to hear the case remains uncertain. If the Court agrees to take up the case, it could issue a stay on the law's enforcement until a final decision is made. However, if the Court declines to hear the case or does not issue a stay, the January 19, 2025, deadline would remain in effect, potentially leading to a US ban on TikTok if ByteDance does not divest its ownership.
___
After stepping down as CEO three years ago, **Jeff Bezos** has re-emerged at Amazon, focusing 95% of his time working on the company's AI initiatives. Speaking at the DealBook Summit on Wednesday, Bezos said, ‚ÄúMy heart is in Amazon, my curiosity is in Amazon, and my fears are there, and my love is there.‚Äù One of the cornerstone projects under Bezos‚Äôs watch involves building a cutting-edge supercomputer in partnership with Anthropic, which is expected to power a multimodal AI model capable of analyzing images, video, and text, further enhancing Amazon‚Äôs AI capabilities.

The reports are in ‚Äî this year's **BFCM weekend sales** set records around the globe! Anecdotally, my clients and I also set personal bests this year. Just how big of a weekend was it? I've rounded up reports to find out. Cyber Monday was officially the biggest online-shopping day ever, according to fresh data from Adobe and Salesforce. US shoppers spent $13.3B (per Adobe) or $12.8B (per Salesforce) on Monday alone. Approximately 197M Americans shopped during the Thanksgiving weekend, surpassing the National Retail Federation's anticipated 183.4M shoppers, but was still lower than the 200M shoppers in 2023. Consumers on average spent $235, or $8 more than 2023, with top gift purchases being apparel and accessories, followed by toys and personal care. Check the comments for additional stats. 
___
**Washington, D.C.'s Attorney General Brian Schwalb** is suing **Amazon** for allegedly excluding certain predominantly Black zip codes from speedy Prime delivery. According to the lawsuit, Amazon relied on UPS and USPS carriers to make deliveries to these neighborhoods, which resulted in longer delivery times. Schwalb claims that beginning in 2022, Amazon stopped using its in-house delivery systems for Ward 7 (83% Black) and Ward 8 (82% Black), while still charging those customers the same amount for a Prime subscription ‚Äî even though only 24% of packages to these Wards were delivered within two days. Schwalb also alleges that Amazon didn't notify any of these customers about the changes. Amazon responded by saying there have been ""specific and targeted acts against drivers delivering Amazon packages"" in those areas, and that it has nothing to do with discrimination. 
___
**The European Union** is preparing stricter measures to address the surge of low-cost packages entering the region from Chinese e-commerce platforms like **Temu** and **Shein**. With nearly 4B low-value parcels expected in 2024‚Äîtriple the number in 2022‚Äîthe influx is overwhelming customs checks, allowing the entry of dangerous goods, such as toxic toys, and counterfeit products. Most packages shipped from China to the EU fall under the region's ‚Ç¨150 customs duty threshold and bypass scrutiny. The EU is proposing a new tax on e-commerce platform revenue and an administrative fee per package, potentially eliminating the ‚Ç¨150 customs duty exemption, and stricter enforcement to reduce the flow of unsafe products like toys and cosmetics. 
___
In September, I reported that **Shopify** and **Roblox** teamed up to pilot Shopify's checkout within Roblox's virtual worlds, marking the first platform commerce partnership for Roblox. At the time, the integration with Shopify was in a pilot phase, with a broader rollout planned for 2025. As of last week, the platform has entered a closed beta test, allowing a select group of developers to gain access to the integration tools, including the creators of the Roblox experiences ‚ÄúCatalog Avatar Creator,‚Äù ‚ÄúTower Heroes,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCreatures of Sonaria,‚Äù with more experiences expected to launch their stores over the next few weeks. Digiday reports that some of the store operators are already reporting a significant boost in sales as a result.
___
While BFCM weekend was record setting across the board for most retailers, the behind-the-scenes winners of the weekend were **buy now pay later** providers. **Splitit** told Business Insider that order volumes were up 62% during Cyber Week compared with last year, and that average order value was about $800, up from $650 last year. **Affirm** data showed that BNPL represented 7% of e-commerce sales this year, up from 2% in 2020. **Klarna** said it saw a 26% increase in orders from Black Friday to the following Sunday. **Afterpay** said it saw a 10% increase from Friday through Monday. **Adobe** said BNPL use reached a record high on Cyber Monday, accounting for almost $1B in sales.
___
In a new report, **GroupM** projected that the advertising industry will surpass **$1 trillion in total revenue** for the first time this year and grow 7.7% to $1.1 trillion in 2025. More than half of that trillion dollars will go to the top five digital advertising companies: Google, Meta, ByteDance, Amazon, and Alibaba. Digital advertising is expected to account for 81.7% of revenue in 2025. 
___
**Bing**¬†is¬†testing¬†an e-commerce shopping card panel at the top of its search results, which looks strikingly similar to Google's recent tests. The¬†screenshots¬†captured show a three column card layout that shows a product grid in the first column, followed by buyer guide tips, popular brands, and related searches in the second and third columns.¬†
___
**The European Commission**¬†is¬†stepping up its monitoring¬†of TikTok's compliance with its Digital Services Act in response to recent election interference in Romania that led to CƒÉlin Georgescu, an independent, far-right, pro-Russian nationalist, as the lead candidate in the first round vote in the country's presidential election last month. TikTok¬†admitted to allowing¬†10M fake accounts to push disinformation in the two months before the election. The Romanian Constitutional Court ordered a recount due to concerns over potential foreign interference from Russia and China, however, the recount revealed no significant discrepancies, so the court certified the results.¬†
___
**X**¬†added a new image generator¬†to its Grok assistant called Aurora that appears to have very few restrictions. Aurora can generate images of public and copyrighted figures like Mickey Mouse without issue, as well as graphic content ‚Äî just no nudes. The image generator excels at photorealistic images, showcasing example images of Ray Romano and Adam Sandler on a sitcom set together.¬†
___
**Wix**¬†integrated¬†its TWIPLA session recording toolkit into its analytics reports, enabling users to replay actual customer journeys through the site to better understand their behavior. Wix says that this is one of the most popular tools it offers to help clients make tangible improvements to their websites, particularly because the granular filtering system makes it easy to find session replays that match specific visitor segments.¬†
___
**TikTok**¬†is¬†moving closer¬†to testing Mini Apps in-stream, similar to what it already has in the Chinese version of the app called Douyin, where third-party developers are able to integrate smaller, more lightweight versions of their own applications directly within the app. App researcher Radu Oncescu found a new reference to ‚ÄúTikTok Minis‚Äù in the app, which could indicate that although TikTok isn't testing the feature yet, they could be on the way. Snapchat launched its own version of Mini Apps back in 2020 called ‚ÄúSnap Minis,‚Äù but eventually shut down the project in 2022 amid broader cost cuts and lack of user interest.¬†
___
**Alibaba International**¬†released a new solution¬†called Pic Copilot, an AI-powered e-commerce design tool designed to streamline photography and design for merchants on its platforms. Pic Copilot features 12 one-click AI design tools that make tasks easier like swapping image backgrounds, editing images and videos, conducting virtual try-ons, and generating ads.
___
**PublicSquare**, a West Palm Beach-based online marketplace that connects consumers with businesses aligning with conservative values,¬†named¬†**Donald J. Trump, Jr**¬†to its board of directors. Trump, Jr. has been an investor in PublicSquare since before the company went public via a SPAC in July 2023. The company's stock nearly quadrupled following the announcement, but has since leveled out at double the price it started prior to the announcement.
___
**Vietnam**¬†suspended the operations¬†of¬†**Temu**¬†after it failed to meet a government deadline to register the company by the end of November. The suspension comes after the ministry had raised concerns about the authenticity of Temu's cheap products and their impact on Vietnam manufacturers. It is unclear if Temu will be allowed to resume its business after it registers.
___
**Amazon**¬†completed its first drone flight test¬†in Italy using its MK30 drone, which can carry up to five pounds of packages through light rain, and in the US, is licensed to operate Beyond Visual Line of Sight. Last year the company announced its plans to expand its drone operations to Italy and the UK pending regulatory approval. In the US, Amazon's drone deliveries are up and running in College Station, TX and Phoenix, AZ.
___
**Shopify**¬†and¬†**Weezer**¬†collaborated¬†to build a shoppable arcade game to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the group's triple-platinum ‚ÄòBlue Album'. The game blended the nostalgia of a classic arcade game with a modern twist ‚Äî players could unlock Weezer merchandise in the Shop app based on their scores. Very cool!
___
The¬†**FBI**¬†warned¬†Android and iPhone users to stop sending unencrypted texts to users of the other operating system after the Salt Typhoon hack of several major US telecommunication providers. Apple's iPhone and Google's Android smartphones have encryption between devices with the same operating system, but messages between the two operating systems aren't encrypted. This sounds like a commercial for WhatsApp, doesn't it?
___
In 2012,¬†**Facebook**¬†printed¬†a¬†**Little Red Book**¬†‚Äî a 148 page mishmash of pop art, corporate e-mails, and aphorisms that were meant to distill the ethos of the company. The book was produced by Ben Barry, a designer working at Facebook who ran an internal print shop called the Facebook Analog Research Laboratory. Bits and pieces of the book have appeared online before, but now an¬†entire high resolution copy¬†of the entire thing is available for your enjoyment, courtesy of Matthew A Parkhurst, who tracked down a physical copy on eBay and shared it with the world.¬†
___
**Speaking of books‚Ä¶**¬†**Taylor Swift**¬†is¬†on track¬†to be this year's best selling author with her self-published The Eras Tour Book, which has sold over 814,000 print copies. Swift opted to sell her book without the aid of Amazon, Walmart, or Barnes & Noble, selecting Target as her exclusive distributor. This isn't Swift's first exclusive collaboration with Target. She's previously launched multiple exclusive albums with the retailer.¬†
___
**Snoop Dogg**¬†launched¬†a new e-commerce site called SWED-com that builds off his brick-and-mortar dispensary in Los Angeles and coffee shop in Amsterdam, which opened earlier this year. The Shopify-powered store features a curated selection of authentic Snoop Dogg and Death Row Records branded products, accessories, and merchandise.
___
**OpenAI**¬†hired¬†Kate Rouch as its first chief marketing officer, nabbing the executive from Coinbase where she led global marketing and public relations. Prior to that, Rouch spent 11 years at Meta, including a role as global head of brand and product marketing for Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Facebook. OpenAI historically hasn't prioritized marketing, yet still manages to reach 250M weekly active users and boast over 1M paying customers.
___
**commercetools**¬†appointed¬†Matt Tuel as chief operating officer, where he will oversee global operations with a focus on enhancing operational efficiency. Tuel was recently COO as Profitero, a SaaS commerce company that was acquired by Publicis Groupe.
___
**Former top Amazon exec Dave Clark**, who recently raised a $100M Series A round for Auger, his AI-powered software startup that aims to transform the global supply chain sector,¬†hired several former Amazon leaders¬†to help bring his vision to life. Among those hires include Amazon's longtime chief scientist Russel Allgor, lead developer of Amazon's ‚ÄúJust Walk Out‚Äù technology Sanjay Dash, and former executive Alex Ceballos who helped oversee Amazon's acquisition of Kiva. All but one of the startup's 11 senior hires previously worked at Amazon, with the majority having spent at least a decade at the company.
___
**Etsy**¬†is having a¬†major executive shakeup¬†next year. The newly created positions of President and Chief Growth Officer will be filled by Kruti Patel Goyal, a longtime executive at the company who currently serves as CEO of Etsy-owned Depop. There will also be a new Chief Financial Officer and Chief Marketing Officer. Etsy's current Chief Operating and Marketing Officer, Raina Moskowitz, is stepping down to become CEO of The Knot.
___
**PayPal**¬†is¬†raising fees¬†for sellers on PayPal Pay Later (its BNPL solution), Alternative Payment Methods, Advanced Credit and Debit Card Payments, and Virtual Terminal. EcommerceBytes noted that PayPal sent an e-mail to customers alerting them to ‚Äúsome changes to our legal agreements,‚Äù but never mentioned in the e-mail notice that the changes involved fee increases.
___
**Meta**¬†is¬†facing up to a ¬£3.1B class action lawsuit¬†in the UK over claims that it exploited 46M users‚Äô personal data through unfair practices stemming from its market dominance, after failing twice to have the case dismissed. The Competition Appeal Tribunal has certified the claim, allowing it to proceed to trial, with affected users automatically included unless they opt out.
___
**Temu**¬†officially launched¬†in Nigeria, now reaching the country's 200M population, which is Africa's largest consumer base. The Nigerian e-commerce sector was valued at over $12B in 2019, and market projections suggest it could reach $75B by 2025, with digital payment systems playing a crucial role in the country's rapid e-commerce growth in recent years.
___
Plus 9 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Zopa**, a UK-based neobank that provides loans, credit cards, and savings accounts to around 1.3M customers, raising ‚Ç¨82M in a round led by A.P. Moller Holding, at an over $1B valuation.

Approximately 197M Americans shopped during the Thanksgiving weekend, surpassing the National Retail Federation's anticipated 183.4M shoppers, but was still lower than the 200M shoppers in 2023. Consumers on average spent $235, or $8 more than 2023, with top gift purchases being apparel and accessories, followed by toys and personal care. Check the comments for additional stats.

**Washington, D.C.'s Attorney General Brian Schwalb** is suing **Amazon** for allegedly excluding certain predominantly Black zip codes from speedy Prime delivery. According to the lawsuit, Amazon relied on UPS and USPS carriers to make deliveries to these neighborhoods, which resulted in longer delivery times. Schwalb claims that beginning in 2022, Amazon stopped using its in-house delivery systems for Ward 7 (83% Black) and Ward 8 (82% Black), while still charging those customers the same amount for a Prime subscription ‚Äî even though only 24% of packages to these Wards were delivered within two days. Schwalb also alleges that Amazon didn't notify any of these customers about the changes. Amazon responded by saying there have been ""specific and targeted acts against drivers delivering Amazon packages"" in those areas, and that it has nothing to do with discrimination.

**The European Union** is preparing stricter measures to address the surge of low-cost packages entering the region from Chinese e-commerce platforms like **Temu** and **Shein**. With nearly 4B low-value parcels expected in 2024‚Äîtriple the number in 2022‚Äîthe influx is overwhelming customs checks, allowing the entry of dangerous goods, such as toxic toys, and counterfeit products. Most packages shipped from China to the EU fall under the region's ‚Ç¨150 customs duty threshold and bypass scrutiny. The EU is proposing a new tax on e-commerce platform revenue and an administrative fee per package, potentially eliminating the ‚Ç¨150 customs duty exemption, and stricter enforcement to reduce the flow of unsafe products like toys and cosmetics.

**TikTok**¬†is¬†moving closer¬†to testing Mini Apps in-stream, similar to what it already has in the Chinese version of the app called Douyin, where third-party developers are able to integrate smaller, more lightweight versions of their own applications directly within the app. App researcher Radu Oncescu found a new reference to ‚ÄúTikTok Minis‚Äù in the app, which could indicate that although TikTok isn't testing the feature yet, they could be on the way.

1hahqkd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ok_Raisin8747/comments/1hahqkd/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_husband_for_sending/,AITA for getting mad at my husband for sending memes to his female co-worker?,"Hello Reddit. I (32F) have been married to my husband (35M) for 11 years. We have had a wonderful marriage no big issues just small fights like any other couples. Well the other day we were on on way to an amusement and we stop by to get coffee. While he was inside he left me his phone to let our youngest daughters watch videos. That's when a msg on his IG came in from woman I did not know asking WYD . I got curious an went to check and that's when I notice their conversation of memes. She will sent him memes like "" I don't care you have a wife , if she cant pleased you I can"" or like "" If someone has not told you today you are hot looking"". While my husband will just like the memes and reply something like ""that's funny"" or ""your dumb"". He also will sent her memes like ""When you get a fresh hair cut and she's all over you"". One I saw this I began to cry and felt like someone punch me in the gut. He came back to the car and I eminently confronted him and he was surprise and told me right away that there was nothing there and he will never cheat on me and he only has eyes for me, that's when he told me that was his coworker and she worked at the office (mind you my husbands is a tech so he works out in the field and the office is 1 hour way from where we live and he only goes there when they have meetings). Since we where on our way to the amusement park I told him we will talk later since I did not want to ruin the day for my kids. Once we got home we talk he told me this was dumb that it was just dumb memes and that there was nothing there. I asked him if he saw that type of conversation of me with a male co-worker would be okay with that? Of course his answer was a ""no"". Then he goes on saying that he sends those memes to the guys not just her. I told him that guys is different compare to the a FEMALE co-worker. Then I told him to stop gaslighting me and if he thinks if was so innocent that I will show these to his mom and sister and they can be a judge of it , he just keep quiet. He then proceed to tell me that he call his coworker before at the office and told her stop msg him those things cause he is married and happily married. Which then I reply then why not block her completely on you social media? I had enough and walked away. It been 2 days and he has yet apologize or try to talk to me about. He has deleted his IG but I feel the damage has been done. I feel he has cross that line and he disrespected me as his wife. I don't mind that he has friend that are girls, but like I told him when someone crosses that line that's on us to stop that person. So AITA for getting mad at my husband, what should I do?

1hahq1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thankyoucards/comments/1hahq1e/basis_and_introductions/,Basis and introductions ,"‚ÄìOnce upon in a time long ago a world was born. They say the serpunus has the power to warp the creator‚Äôs imagination to their will. And thus many came after it. But the writer hold the power and fate with his mind. As long as that is intact nobody can take from what they haven‚Äôt earned. (Also if you are wondering Detroit Lakes is a real town situated far north.

1. I had a dream that I was at this garden place. The reason why I walked in the garden was because the kids had walked out of the classroom with the teacher . As if I was a threat to them. I walked the garden peacefully until I saw a familiar figure watching me towards the name of Santiago. I looked out and saw the giant garden separated into four smaller squares or accompanied by one large square.¬†
2. I had a dream that Chance‚Äôs parents were thugs and gang members I met them at the middle school in Jimmy Carter for some reason I angered them and they chased me up a tree.
3. I had a dream that someone shot up our school. I ran outside of MAS looking for coverage but only found the densely poorly put together string of sewage pipes and water pipes converging with each other. The killer chased me deeper into the mess of pipes. I arrived at my house and ran inside my bedroom to be brought up by an alien sitting in my desk chair. I asked the alien how much smarter he was than me and he said 10,000. I woke up in a sweat desperately running to my school downtown. I asked my chemistry teacher Mr. Ricter about the alien and he explained by asking me a question.
4. I had a dream that a local businessman got arrested and was brought to the ruins of a highschool. Years before the highschool shut down. But it got reopened and turned into a mall. But the mall got turned down and abandoned. From what I get from the dream¬† is they go down there in order to get something. Like something is hidden deep inside.
5. I had a dream that at the Detroit Lakes High School we had to have a race with cockroaches. I was picked and passed out.
6. I had a dream that Shane and I went to a school. It was a fortress in the middle of the plains. We spent time in the pool talking to each other as a prince outside of the school pool inside of the golden wheat field watches his dad blind his girlfriend.
7. I had a dream that a childhood friend of mine played in the snow in our neighborhood. A little neighborhood that curved like a wishbone neatly tucked below the Peak of a lake shore. I played a little longer with her until I got called inside my grandma's house. I go to bed upstairs and just as Nana tucks me in I. But I see a monster looking through the window and scream. The next day I confront the monster with my childhood friend but it turns to cardboard. Papa congratulates us and tells us that this is all just a test.
8. I had a dream that I was with a friend. He showed me a place deep beneath his bunker and introduced me to his mother and sister. He was fiddling with a machine until he broke something. The ground shook beneath us and a giant tornado tore apart the house. I got on my motorcycle getting the hell out of there. After the craziness of it all I soon discovered that the tornados not only destroyed¬† the city but also changed the weather forever. Me or technically Maxwell Boit, my old friend from Detroit lakes went to an orphanage to see if any help was needed. The nanny kindly declined but set us up with one little favor giving us our oath that we would kill whoever did this to their city. Max promised and set off to go to the beach. The broken land was swarming with clouds and dusty water droplets poisoned the remaining swept up clean water reserves. Max does well in the school he is at and excels in the math department so he gets a scholar trip to cancun. But his mother and family stop him from achieving his dreams. So he stays behind giving up everything he worked so hard for and becomes a fisher.
9. I had a dream that a woman lived with her grandma on a highly populated island. It was right by Petlio.¬†
10. I had a dream that we were being tested in a laboratory in an underground disclosed area. Most likely the same island that the woman lives on with her grandma.
11. I had a dream that we were on this cargo ship.¬† Everything started to sink so I had to evacuate the area. But not without leaving everything and everyone behind. I was the only one that was able to come out of the shithole of a life I liked and you can‚Äôt guess it. In petlio!!
12. I had a dream that Chance was at the MVCC community center. We talked a bit from a bit in side the game room. Also known as Parkeys because somebody or kid got his head shoved in a toilet and drowned in the room. Enough to make anyone reconsider a place for discussion and talk.
13. I had a dream that this guy sent me to this hotel full of magical creatures. And being not seen to the public eye this was a top secret mission. I came across an abandoned schoolyard?? No way it couldn‚Äôt be. The monsters living inside of the school are the same as what the police boy and businessman came here for? To find monsters?¬†
14. I had a dream that I was in a pizza plex. I looked around until I came across Freddy. I asked him to help me get out of this wall and he seemed only capable to help to the point of protecting me from whatever these monsters hold. Welp well here we go. A kid helps me get out of the vents as I head for safety. We manage to break Freddy out of there too. I then run to the nearest car but he gives us on intel in whatever fairyland we are in. Uh what?
15. I had a dream that I lived in the coastal city that was in the edge of a mountainous swamp. The ground raised up from the sea to the land expanding towards the skies clouds so fast it hurt to look at the sharp peaks. The city was large though and managed to work its way around the challenges the region presented. A rich man sitting on top of his penthouse talked to me at the white balcony about how he wanted to expand his control across the continent.¬†
16. ¬†I had a dream that I was looking at a wondrous colorado. The only problem was that people were entering the country illegally and sent to these massive concentration camps and death marches similar to the trail of tears on the golden wheat field.
17. ¬†I had a dream that we traversed a giant mountain and went inside to find a massive cavern with a stronghold inside the jemez. There were a few people inside with me but I don‚Äôt recognize why or who they are.
18. I had a dream that I went up to Albuquerque or behind it to find an tranquil like state of mountains. The morning dew set on the green grass. Colorful waterfalls only colorful because of the reflected buildings around them. Chance‚Äôs nanny invited me to a playdate. I arrived at his mansion in the village as we played with his dinosaurs. I heard his parents arguing behind my back. He looked sorry for me and even said it to my face.¬†
19. I had a dream that I went to the Sandia mountains again to find myself traversed in a savannah like area. I went back home to talk to my parents and we both went to the top of the peaks. I remember a skier telling me to look at the other mountains beyond where I lived at. How I shouldn‚Äôt be limited to what I perceive to be my home. There are many other homes out there. You just have to find the right one.
20. I had a dream that I went to the zoo like place up inside of the mountains (Jemez) all the animals were pinned up small cells for experiments the lady who lived here did to them. I backed her off and she angrily responded by ending this little feud between us with a chess like board game.
21. ¬†I had a dream that I was in a giant trampoline park. I climbed up one and saw Anahi and Chance. I talked to them.¬†
22. I had a dream that bugs came out of this guys eye.

25. I had a dream that I got arrested at Jimmy Carter.
26. I had a dream that a city was about to go underwater because of a curse on the land. The prince worried for his people tried to find the issue but none arose. Until the walls failed to materialize and the entire ocean collapsed on them.
27. I had a dream that I was in this hut. It was dark, dusty and stormy outside. As we looked over the grim castle. A man to my right told me his plan as beau to my left also told me what he was going to do. We made it inside of the castle and negotiated with the priest.
28. I had a dream that we were in a small. Courtroom.¬†
29. I had a dream that we were in Alaska. With a couple other residents. For some reason we left Isabelle and her Sister Sophia somewhere in China. I slept by the cozy fireplace in this tavern by the frozen sea.
30. I had a dream that we were going to take a trip to chicago with Nana and Papa. Chicago looked different because the buildings were made out of red brick.¬†
31. I had a dream that Mr. Murphy came in and opened up the vents in our classroom. But the people complained as the vents showed their true size. Impossibly big in such a small area.
32. I had a dream that we were spies in a war biddered country. I arrived at the capitol with its tall futuristic buildings crawling out of the dead ground like hands of zombies.¬†
33. I had a dream that during my spy years I lived at a mansion near the mountains. The greenery didn‚Äôt match up with the pale walls of the building. It looked almost like the forest resented what man has built here. I saw kids going through a parkour course as the old man looked at them. He talked to me a little. I went back towards the city and confronted a woman who barfed all over the floor of her expensive hotel room. It started to snow outside.
34. I had a dream that I was in this murder case with a girl in a desert town. We arrived to a secret lab and knew he was the murder. Later I said my goodbyes to her. I probably told my parents and freaked out they transferred me to live in the city.¬†
35. I had a dream that it was Jolean‚Äôs last day. I also recall this girl living inside of my attic. Meanwhile Rhea and Jolean talk to each other during their prom.
36. I had a dream that I was back in Detroit Lakes and we were all in the Detroit Lakes school. I stepped in and we all had been waking up at least 4 flights of stairs. The rest of the school was the same except the added two floors.
37. I had a dream that we were all back in Detroit Lakes playground. But instead it was a tower game where you had to knock out the other person‚Äôs tower. The only two standing was Beau and I. I talked with him.
38. I had a dream that we were in papa‚Äôs mansion. A friend and I tried to find something worth exploring but instead while at the wooden gazebo got a threat from one of the maids living there telling us to leave.¬†
39. I had a dream that at the Roosevelt school I was walking down the front stairs when a guy with a gun came. Thankfully somebody arrested him before anything could happen.
40. I had a dream that I was at nana‚Äôs house and came out to go get a fish, when I saw a girl already doing the same thing. She had a map in her hand and encouraged me to follow her around the city. We ran through the tall reed grass of the swamp in mud lake. I arrived at the town's main shop center. Neatly placed buildings sitting along the edge of mud lake. A massive guy challenged us to a game of volleyball and the girl accepted.
41. I had a dream that I was in the Detroit Lakes High school and we played a game of kickball with a floating ice sphere beaming like a disco almost touching the roofs of the gym. Brynn amazed by my ability to move swiftly asked me to join her team as I got ready to leave the city heading towards the airport.
42. I had a dream that I was back in Detroit Lakes but in a different neighborhood. I had lived in this house but the rooftops peaked until the twirled downward like a slinky.
43. I had a dream that I went to the DLCCC on a rainy evening. I arrived and saw a huge swimming pool. I swam some laps and tired sat as I watched others do the same thing. But the weird part is that it felt like I was on a spaceship like the entire l shaped brick building got engines and skyrocket upwards to the blackness of space. I felt like I was floating and free to do anything space would allow me to do in this dreary area.¬†
44. I had a dream that I was in this Olympic sized track and field. I had to move this giant boulder across the moving arena. I somehow was able to make this and move on. From there I met the rest of my competition.
45. I had a dream that this huge swampy area in nana‚Äôs lot. Inside of it was this huge mansion, emblazoned with white pearls on its staircases and pointed wooden roofing sticking out like a soar thumb managing to look like a witches house painted white and rolling with neatly trimmed grass. I met the daughter. Inside of her room is a aquarium. A wife and the aunt are making pea soup in the kitchen. They tell me about her daughters father and the monster he became. I come across a enslaver shackling children and telling them to find something. One of the tree forest kids help me get out of the area and flew me up. I met the leader and he flew me up hundreds of feet from the ground.
46. I had a dream that I lived in the Detroit Lakes countryside and outskirts. Were my grandparents and I would drive up to this post office. This rockstar dude also had delivered our packages and letters. We went back to our house. The town looked different though with giant pillars coming out of it and rock cliffs shaped like sticker thorns. My first destination was at the barbershop. The barber happy to see me congratulated me on something about upcoming prom. I went later to the elementary school. I saw the boy scouts leader.
47. I had a dream I was in painted sky elementary school. The school curled like a one story tall horse shoe. It was cloudy outside and inside of the horse shaped¬† school was the playground. I saw the arts and crafts room and -
48. I had a dream that the events of dreams 47 are now being continued. I opened the arts and crafts room and heard a bus coming. I went outside of the school to see what the hassle¬† was. The bus driver told me to get on and I did. As I sat awkward in a flying school bus it finally landed in a small town. The houses looking like they would collapse at any minute because of their unsturdy foundations in the rocky wrapping around in a birds eye view. I stopped at the school and pressed the elevator as I went spirling downwards. I saw the doors open and show me the atrium area. Large arches supported the ground below us and the middle sections of the underground roof showed us the outside. The windows were at ground level. We must of been at least 60 meters below. I saw a kid drinking coffee and joined him.
49. I had a dream that I went to Duluth with a couple of friends. They asked me how I got here so quickly because I flew when they had to trek through the forests of the north. They scratched it off though and I found out that duluth was not a lake. It was a bay area widened out, suffocated by the two different mountains barreling down to the size of a river then widening out, dipping back into the ocean.¬†
50. I had a dream that I was in this wild western town with a corrupt banker. I stopped the banker and in the present the desert ghost town resurrected into a blooming oasis overflowing in size and people.
51. I had a dream that we were in a building competition. I won and was invited by the owner of the new house.
52. I had a dream that my cousins and I went on this trip to the plains in this large wooden house. I woke up and saw flors mom cooking and talking to her.
53. I had a dream that I saved chance from a school bus. We landed in the parks water probably downtown chicago. I met these robots but only two that I very distinctly remember Rover. A robot with something metallic and circular in the middle of it. Originally I was going to say that rover was to be a part of mars but he probably is from a different world altogether. This robot guy had a floating drone that had copied whatever personality he had felt or saw. The drone seemed to have a mind of its own and only copied on instinct to what it wanted to do not what its owners wanted. The coding was physically present sent into a holographic displayer. We all saw this young child running away from these large dogs. I wanted to help but Chance and the robots stopped me. The child fell down as the dogs tore the clothing apart. The crowds around the scene looked just as terrified as me but the child instead shapeshifted into a teenaged girl beautiful my mouth fell wide open. Chance saw me and gave me a nudge. She greeted chance and he and her talked as we went to the zoo. Chance had to go to the bathroom so I was left with her. My first impressions were nowhere near excellent as she asked me what I was handling and I told her it was a platypus. She looked at it and screamed like I was killing her. I could tell we both embarrassed each other. And she was not happy with the performance.
54. I had a dream that something was chasing us out of the outskirts of a coastal city. We were in the plains and I took off towards the gleaming city skylines.

1. I had a dream that I moved into Oklahoma City which eventually looked a lot like the Chicago I had dreamed of earlier. I saw Jesus and Alma. One day I had an argument with my mother about being here on the phone and told her I wasn‚Äôt going to move back with her ever again.¬†
2. I had a dream that I was back in Detroit Lakes and inside of Nana‚Äôs house. I went upstairs and found a little door half the size of me go somewhere. As I climbed inside I realized I was inside of the elfs letter storage capital. The place where all the letters in the world where sent to and distributed. I climbed out and headed towards the airport. From there I met tristan and talked to him a little before he handed me a golden ticket and offered to take me to some city.

1. I had a dream that I was on an airplane with several other people. We started going off and into the air where I saw mont Rainier and several other mountains. They were separated by the mainland but only by a hair and a string of cheese shaped land the mountains occupied. It was barely large enough for them and looked as if the mountains were oversized for the land sloping into the water. The airplane I was on malfunctioned and crashed into the cheese mountains. After that with the rest of the remaining survivors instead of working together we all started to fight about something.
2. I had a dream that I was at Nana‚Äôs house for some reason I was living with a stuffed animal dog that could predict the future. But this time he did it wrong and told me that my friends airplane was going to crash and explode in the air. I didn‚Äôt know that airplanes could crash in the air but ok. Anyways the point being he was wrong thank god.
3. I had a dream that I was going on this airplane. This girl kissed me before getting off telling me about sofia. When I got off and landed in Fargo it felt like I was inside a portrait of a painting. The colors the artist splashed on the painting where absolute and masterfully welldone.¬†

But not only that rumors where going on that the husband threatened to kill his wife and that was why he tried to burn the house down. He was then arrested as my mother pinned and locked the front of the entrance door so I wouldn‚Äôt be able to escape.
6. I had a dream that we lived in front of a landmass that resembled Alaska. It looked like a steampunk version of Anchorage and the locals asked me what I was looking for. I told them I wanted to go to the tops of the maps at the top of the world and they looked at me confused. They only told me that dangerous magic looms there where witches use it to keep out any outsiders.
7. I had a dream that we were riding jaguars in the colorado mountains. Later I was in a downtown shopping place. I went outside to try and warn elijah of the blade that went through his head but by then it was already too late. He died and I went back to the shopping district. Seeing the prices of everything go up made my heart sink knowing deep inside this would drive away any customers in such a desolated part of of the world. I was surprised people still heard of us.

1. I had a dream that we were in a forest with some kids. One kid died and the others died in the cabin. So I went out and ran as fast as I could away from the crooked forest. I vowed to kill whatever that thing was. But it looked like a cat that could stand on its two legs.

Afterwards I arrived at this house. With a core memory shaped like a mini carousel where it glowed bright red. Then I tried to destroy but this person wouldn‚Äôt let me so I just left it there. I tried to go to its default memory. It was snowing outside as well. Gavin and this kid also where running away from this other kid that tried to shoot them down. He got one kid and eventually did get Gavin.
8. I had a dream that how a friend and I were making something in nanas garage. Afterwards we arrived at his empty house which for some reason had the shape of a disfigured foxy. Afterwards I tried to warn him not to go running in the facility but he didn‚Äôt listen to me. I also met slenderman to in his house. I found the city broken but mine to live in. Something I‚Äôve never felt. It was almost like it was ok to be broken and in a place that you hate. I tried to \*\*\*\*\*\*\* all over myself. I came to farmington with my parents and with the girls. I picked out the cutest wooden carved out sculpture they were selling.¬†
9. I had a dream that a massive tornado hit Oklahoma City. We were driving in downtown where the time was midnight and it was dark, stormy and wet.

Later or fast forward I am in Colorado Springs I met these boys and I am invited to their house to play. I look out it was covered to the tops on a very steep spikey landscape. It had looked so beautiful and wonderful and very snowy on the tops we played video games up until late at night. We all cuddled up in our beds in the same bed for some reason I had to leave for. Crack came to us and said goodbye. I talked to snape about the power of dreams before departing. I arrived at this sacred underground place where Crack showed me. It was a mysterious dungeon¬† a his parents chased after us we arrived at a deep into the sewage systems into some laboratory of some sorts. Intrigued I looked into it before waking up at 9:10 in the morning.
13. I had a dream that a monster lived in the sewers. I went up into the land to find a youtuber talking about¬† how his minecraft world had changed. He showed me the strange base and pipes that crawled to the tops of the sky. Water was drizzling inside of them as well. I also remember Fit telling me about how the mods had a hard time dealing with hackers on a daily basis. He in response took me to the other side of the hilltop where his base used to be. Much of it was intact and ready to be lived in but I do suspect that he must of been afraid somebody had the chance to raid the dam thing.
14. I had a dream that I was in this house up north inside it was victorian styled furniture. The small house was set in the snowy plains of the northern slopes. Endless snow drifts down the dark rolling clouds in the most loneliest town on earth. I called it barren and all the residents of the town knew each other well. They all talked about stuff as I hosted the party. I‚Äôm pretty sure this connects to some other dream I had about the core memories. Interesting how it all connects like its some sort of spider web.

27. I had a dream that I was in a strange school shaped to be the most fitting castle in the world. It had fancy chandeliers the richest would be jealous of.

The junkyard being everything in the vicinity to the northern slopes of the town. Here young teenagers would mess with policemen hoping they wouldn‚Äôt get caught in the act.

37. I had a dream that I was walking with Vincent and Samantha down a street in Albuquerque. At first he started walking in font of me but kept on going faster and faster until we were all practically racing. I could never catch up to Vincent because he was running to fast and ironically was frustrated with himself for not going faster then what his potential would allow him.¬† Afterwards I went to bed at night to only be awaken by a swarm of UFOs. One large UFO in the sky kept on attacking the other UFOs and swallowing them whole. They came to my house and for some weird reason made a celebration for me.
38. I had a dream that I was at this house. I knew we were near Albuquerque because of the mazonono mountain range. Being there and all. Afterwards I looked outside to find a giant dark storm and wanted or felt like something was off about it. I wanted to go explore it as we were in this house and all but just could not. Later in the house nana came to us and told that if we do not use our toothbrushes correctly then bugs would go into our eyes. Next I saw Maxwell and another boy walking the path the lonely road.
39. I had a dream that a young girl was screaming outside of my window at night. I looked out and saw two men pushing her inside of a van. They soon to drove away. Later in my dreams I had these two nice asian people as we ate stuff they gave me their small house to live in. I asked them if they could teach me to speak their language but they said no saying it was dangerous to even talk about it. I eventually got them to agree but only because I knew a little bit of it from a different world. Also a vampire met miguel and they played a game of the sun.
40. I had a dream that It was really hot. Especially in places like sedona. I went inside of the high school, met celeste but realized quickly that her body was mangled like a twisted coke can thrown out. The school went on lockdown and Joel was put as the prime suspect for it. I snuck inside of the school and on the fourth floor found Vincent playing basketball. I wanted to jump off but didn‚Äôt because I was deathly afraid of heights. I met Luke inside the school while spying on the authorities and their meeting at the top floor of the school. He showed me along with a black girl what exactly was in this school. LIminal spaces that would contract on size if felt threatened. I went to the ball pit.
41. I had a dream that I was in a house. I went back and pulled the blankets over my face after realizing that a monster arrived in my house. I tried to pull the monster back but it never worked and the monster saw me dragging me to the small shed in the backyard. I arrived a giant library in a strange school. As I walked around I discovered things about the world and the harsh propaganda it endured from its leaders. Finding a radio I put the batteries in and noticed a talking voice inside of it. It was another person more intelligent about the nature of this world and what it brought along with it. In other words it was the soul of my drive and willpower. (potentially to free whatever shackled these people or beings down in the world in the first place?)¬†
42. I had a dream that Jan showed me the school in the water or in the middle of the ocean. The winds grabbed out like a thousand hands pushing me in different directions as I tried to walk across the schools confusing maze. It was also divided by the japanese and the filipinos.¬†
43. I had a dream that I was at Detroit Lakes community school. I looked around the place as I saw Mr. Castro get arrested. There was people at the movie theator also.¬†
44. I had a dream that I was in this secret looking laboratory where I met this girl. She was nice until I heard her brother telling us to pack our bags and leave the plants inside of the laboratory he worked so hard on. So we did just that. He enrolled his sister in a special private school in exchange for the laboratory and the plants inside of the labatory as well. How weird and strange. Why would they want these plants in the first place? He told me he couldn‚Äôt be there for her all the time and wanted me to look out for her wellbeing so I also enrolled and lied telling the people I got picked by the highest lord in all the lands. I actually forged it. I followed her around the place making sure she wouldn‚Äôt get into crazy trouble. Meawhile in the downtown city the boy sought out the love of his life as he and her kissed under the skylight moon.¬†
45. I had a dream that I was with Chance at this strange hill. We and Anahi talked about looting the nearest place the top of Tlano hill. But as we got there whoever owned the hill kidnapped Anahi and held her for ransom. Leaving no real choice as I hid on top of the shaft going upwards to the top of the floor I saw that this was a bomb factory and wasting no time lit the match sending shock waves all over the place. I do not know if any of us survived but I think I‚Äôm giving it the benefit of the doubt.
46. I had a dream that Cottonwood classical was actually a large mansion that was generously donated by someone rich. So that was me of them. I got in I think. Unless of I don‚Äôt actually know. But I do know the last dream for this entry to conclude Serpunus.
47. I had a dream that a weird cat creature was standing outside of my doorway. I went on the school bus as usual but something was off. I looked outside to realize that here was a true monster. Somebody told me that everyone in this world has two beetles inside of their bodies to accommodate for the lack of something else they did not have. I walked the path into the future. I noticed several things like how the majority of people did not know how to read. I wonder if this had to do with the way the old couple did not want me to read or write in their language. How they thought that the languages would hurt society rather than help them.

Can we just meet and fall in love already ? And settle, move to our home and start making plans to travel the world, make some weekend-get-away plans, read books, play games, watch stuff together ? All the great stuff.. But first, we gotta get to know each other.. I'd like to walk around your mind and I'd also love to know that you're walking around mine, not leaving me alone in my own world.

I'm having quite hard time keeping my cadence up for this faaaaast moving, quick-changing and extremely impersonal world, so therefore I've realized that apps are not my thing.. I can actually explain more about myself here. So yeah, let's give this another chance :))

I'd say I'm a funny, energetic, sarcastic, and yet chill, calm, and sometimes depressive type of guy (see. winter sadness lol ). I care about my looks, I know what I want from life, partner, work... I'm quite confident I'd say as much as one can be.. I have my matters in order. I know this sounds very disciplined and rigid but I have sooo much leeway for anything and everything.

I like to spend my time with loads of stuff like having a pint with friends every now and then, going to the gym 3 times a week, playing games (currenly playing POE 2 but also a fan of BF series), watching movies/series (drama,sci-fi,comedy you name it I love all and I'm a movie buff I'd say :D ), playing guitar, reading books, lying down on the rug watching the ceiling while listening to Pink Floyd... Idk there's loads of stuff :D

I enjoy deep chats quite a lot, philosophy, and endless banter especially no-holds-barred type of banters are fun... honestly any no-holds convo can turn into something funny :lol :D

I'd say I'm quite caring, protective, solution-oriented, open to communicate, and quite straightforward guy... but as you might've guessed already those just don't come from day one... feelings are feelings because we can't control them, right?

Maybe we can walk in the parks holding hands talking about the movie we watched yesterday and about the characters? We can read poems to each other and maybe learn different things every other day and share them? We can prank each other, come up with weird jokes to see others reaction :D... all those lovely stuff... live in a wee village outskirts of a big bustling city but not in it and have late-night drives together? We can go for an ice cream at 3 am and settle for a terrible garage coffee LOL...

What I'm looking for?

I'd say someone who has her life in somewhat order, who's in touch with her emotions, who's honest or should I say blunt (in a nice way :D), who's loyal, and who's curious about things in life... who knows what she wants, someone who's giving, caring and good at communication. we don't want to play guess games right ?

I'd say I'm an ambivert so I like going out for gigs, stand-ups, pints with peeps, but also need my alone time and indoors time so I love to have a cozy nights in so would prefer someone who'd be okay with this kind of cadence. But I should say I'm more leaning into spending time at home.

Things I think could be deal-breaker for some people:  
\- I'm Atheist. But I do respect religions as long as the respect is mutual and it's not your total personality.  
\- Got 4 tattoos.  
\- I'm Turkish originally. Apparently the least sophisticated thing about me is quite important for some.. so if you care about it there you go :))

Other stuff:  
188cm (6'2"") tall, 90 kg (200 pounds), fit but no abs LOL \*crying in distance\*, green eyes, Caucasian, brown hair, beard, and mustache.

I'm looking for something long-term, something meaningful, deep and strong. I know it takes time and effort to build so I'm here to give that time and energy .. hope you are too !",1,1733771518.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I recently got into pourover and started experimenting a lot. I did many side-by-side comparisons and found the following.

1. Beans make a big difference (duh!). I can clearly taste differences between different beans. Just to get that out of the way before I continue. 
2. ‚Å†I find differences between different ratios (60g/L vs 65g/L vs 70g/L) very noticable. 
3. The difference between coffee brewed with Volvic and the same coffee brewed identically with super hard tap water is noticable to me. In a side-by-side comparison, I can tell that the tap water mutes acidity a bit, though overall the difference isn't big and I really only taste the difference in acidity. Although I only tested this with a highly processed natural. 
4. ‚Å†I tried grinding quite a bit finer brewing with the V60 and couldn't tell the difference at all in a side-by-side comparison. I tested this with a Sumatra natural and a Colombia washed, both light roasts. I did taste a difference when grinding very coarse or espresso-fine, but everything in a reasonable range tasted the same to me.
5. ‚Å†I tried brewing the Sumatra natural with water straight off the boil and with water cooled down for a minute (without lid) and couldn't tell a difference either. 
6. ‚Å†This is where I thought either I'm crazy or all of you. I brewed with the same water, grind size and ratio in a French press and a V60, and even there I couldn't tell a difference side by side. I tried with both beans. The only difference I could find was sediment in the last sip of the French press cup.
7. ‚Å†I also brewed a V60 cup with the Colombia washed and brought it in a thermos to the roaster's caf√© around the corner where I compared to their Kalita with the same ratio. I could taste a noticable difference there. I think theirs was more extracted, maybe a bit too much for my taste. They're using their own water and an EK43 while I have a Kingrinder K6. 

What is going on here? I feel a bit stupid not being able to taste the difference between FP and V60.",3,1733771378.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

There you go, asking me that again,
You made me afraid to grow up because ignorance is bliss and I'm blissfully in love with you.
You say I never listen, that I'm blind to your affection and ambitions, I'm also blind to your flaws, your weaknesses, your insecurities and your need to control me.
There's an irony there, you control everything else around you except yourself and that's tragically poetic.
You break my dreams and use the pieces to build your own, I love to build onto you, and you love to see me in pieces.
When I'm shattered you get to play doctor, when I'm broken you then are my phycologist, when I want to invest in my dreams you become my financial advisor, ofcourse advising against, youre right, dont waste good dreams on someone like me, yet you trust me with yours.

The day it all starts making sense will become the day you have to go, its irony, you always hated our apartments and houses, I was grateful for shelter, yet you want me to leave, it shows me you really only hate the space we share, you really only hate me.
What?
There you go asking me that again,
You said you wanted me out, needed me away, and so I confine myself in blissful solitude and you show up crying, shattered and drunk.
I put on coffee, I wipe your tears, I hold your hair as you release sorrow, wine and bad decisions all over my bathroom.
You hold me closer to avoid looking at my face, you don't wanna see the disappointment and hurt, yet you want me to hold you until your pain and self disappointment subsides.
You trust me enough to mend you, but not enough to be without you, and you expected there to be a replacement of you when I opened the door, you expected me to be laughing and happy with someone else, but you didn't care about first impressions, thats ironic.
In your mind this person was gonna look better than you, fuck better than you, cook better than you, be everything you wasn't, yet, you show up in the worst way, broken, crying, and belligerent.
I slept on the floor so you can have the couch, you hold the blankets tighter to hide your feelings of being rejected, it's ironic, you used to make me out to be a monster, yet you disturb my peace, you wreak of vomit and depression, you corrupt my safe space, you destroyed my friendships and shattered the fragile relationships I had with my family, you made me feel small so that I could be more comfortable for you to step on or over, but I guess the difference between us is that you cry more and I feel less.
Actually 
I feel a lot, I just find it pointless to explain myself to a hypothetical brick wall, then I really would look crazy, I find it pointless to tell you my feelings, or allow you near my dreams, I'm not weak, I'm just more humane than you and you hate that, 
You hate anything that I refuse to sacrifice for you, that includes my self respect, integrity and peace.
In my head, I say fuck you, but out my mouth I say I'm sorry, I'm sorry because I can't grow up enough to be honest with you, to tell you that if I never see you again I hope you prosper, but that I would be ok with that.
That I would rather keep our good memories and end it here, than keep you around and let you destroy every good thing we ever built, id rather say goodbye than watch you destroy our legacy just because we've grown apart.
It's ironic, you run out of another person's bed in the middle of the night to try and catch me with someone else, you're right, that does make sense, you text me while you're with someone else to argue about why we're not together, you're right, that does make sense.

Everything you do is magic, it's ironic, you flourish as long as you can keep up the illusion of happiness and self control, needing only that everyone around you live in the same delusion and never tell your secrets.
I guess I lack imagination, it's ironic, I grew to a point where I can't imagine living a lie because it's killing me inside, while you kill off everything we loved because then you feel more alive, because then you...feel.
You're right, we do feel like strangers, maybe we should've left it as to ships passing in the night, it seems when I cared less, you tried more, yet when i came as a knight in shinning armor to save you with no judgement, you hold up a mirror to show me I'm the only one who needed saving.
It's ironic, you were right, so allow me to do that now.

1haha6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bettermetips/comments/1haha6t/betterme_the_definitive_guide_to_intermittent/,BetterMe: The Definitive Guide to Intermittent Fasting for Men Over 45,"Intermittent fasting is all about timing your meals. It involves alternating between eating and fasting periods. By giving your body time to rest and repair, IF encourages fat burning, boosts metabolic health, and helps maintain muscle mass‚Äîcrucial for men over 45 as metabolism slows and testosterone drops. Here's a quick review of the main IF tips and patterns.

**The Best IF Methods for Men Over 45**

* **16:8 Method:** Fast for 16 hours and eat within an 8-hour window‚Äîone of the most popular and effective methods.
* **5:2 Method:** Eat normally for 5 days, and cut calories (500-600) for 2 non-consecutive days.
* **12:12 Method:** Start with an easy 12-hour fast overnight to ease into it.

**Why Does IF Work?**  
Fasting helps reduce calorie intake, jumpstart fat burning, and boost energy levels. It‚Äôs less about restriction and more about giving your body the time it needs to reset. With a combination of healthy eating and fat-burning exercises, like strength training, IF can help men over 45 see lasting results.

**What Can You Expect After 1 Month of IF?**  
After a month of consistent fasting, you‚Äôll likely notice a decrease in belly fat, better mental clarity, and improved sleep. Plus, it helps your body switch from burning carbs to using fat as fuel‚Äîresulting in better metabolic health!

**Maximize Your Results with These Tips**

* Stay hydrated (water, herbal tea, or black coffee is your friend).
* Focus on high-protein meals to maintain muscle.
* Pair IF with fat-burning exercises like strength training and HIIT.
* Be patient and listen to your body‚Äîsuccess comes with consistency!

IF isn't a quick fix but a lifestyle change that can help you feel leaner, more energized, and healthier‚Äîwithout the complicated rules of fad diets. Ready to give it a try? Start small, be consistent, and enjoy the benefits!

‚ùî‚ùî What‚Äôs your experience with intermittent fasting? Have you tried it before, or are you considering giving it a go?

A guide for what to do and what not to do. My (25) ex-GF (24) asked to have a break or open the relationship after two and a half years and I broke up with her,"So, this is a pretty long post explaining my last relationship for the good people of reddit who are confused and don‚Äòt have enough courage to handle hardship at the end of their relationships.¬†

To give you some insight,¬†you can find the previous post I made [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/s/l5EYwlHqti), before breaking up with her during last summer.

**After about 24 hours of no sleep, spending the whole time reflecting, analyzing every word we‚Äôd said over the phone after the original post I've made on** r/Advice **, I called her the next day and ended the relationship. It was incredibly painful. She cried like a helpless child, and I cried like a helpless child after hanging up. I canceled our planned vacation and we went no contact for two weeks.**

Now, this is where I want to share some hard lessons learned, to help anyone going through something similar‚Äîor who might in the future.

Two weeks after the breakup, she texted me asking to set a date to pick up her things. We‚Äôd both be in my city after the summer break. Instead of just answering with a date that worked for me, I called her, and we ended up talking for three hours. **DON‚ÄôT DO THAT.**

I asked if she‚Äôd slept with anyone since the breakup. She said no. I asked if she had cheated on me during the relationship. Again, she said no. I told her how much I missed her, how I couldn‚Äôt understand why everything had fallen apart, and that she meant a lot to me. I even suggested we could stay friends. She told me similar things, and the conversation spiraled in that way for hours. **This was a huge mistake.**

What you‚Äôre really missing is not the person, but the space they occupied in your life. By doing what I did, I opened a wound that had begun healing, and the healing process had to start over. **Don‚Äôt try to stay friends with your ex.** It only causes more confusion and chaos in the long run.

Fast forward a couple of weeks. We met in person at my flat to exchange our belongings. She left her luggage at my place, and we went for coffee and a walk. We updated each other on our lives, and eventually, the conversation turned back to the end of our relationship. She said she didn‚Äôt understand why it happened and apologized. I asked a lot of questions, but her answers were vague, and she kept saying, ""I don‚Äôt know.""

At this point we were out for more than two hours and talked about hard stuff, so we were both very emotional. It was time to go back to my flat for her to pick up her luggage and say goodbye. As we prep things up she kisses me and says she is sorry for everything. We kept kissing for a while and I was like what the hell, if that is the case we might as well have one last nice day and that is it. **DON‚ÄòT DO THAT.**

I was still thinking I could be friends with her at this point. As we walked back to my flat, heading toward what was clearly going to be our break up sex, something felt off. I had this nagging feeling that there were still things she wasn‚Äôt telling me, so I confronted her.

That‚Äôs when she admitted: **""I lied to you. The night we broke up, I was so devastated, I got really drunk at a party with my colleagues and slept with one of them. I just needed attention.""**

I was crushed hearing this, but I told myself, ‚ÄúWhatever, we might as well have one last nice day together.‚Äù

I asked if it was at least good. She said no.

We went back to my flat, had sex‚Äînothing special, certainly not the best‚Äîand afterward, she cuddled me and apologized for how everything had turned out. She got dressed, packed her shit, and left.

I was emotionally numb, confused. I didn‚Äôt feel bad right away‚Äîin fact, I even felt some strange satisfaction. **DON‚ÄôT DO THAT.**

A few days later, I felt like absolute shit. The reality of it all hit me hard, and the regret set in.

After more than a month of no contact, the universe threw me another curveball. I had to have a business trip to her small city and give a performance with her (we are both in the same line of work) As you can imagine she texted me a week before, saying how much she is looking forward to see me, if she forgot this or that in my place last time and if I would be up to have coffee with her etc. to cut short I replied some form of why not let‚Äòs see.

But then I really started to think about it. I was making progress since I saw her last time. I was hitting the gym, eating better, focusing on my work, meeting new people, and rediscovering myself. So I asked myself: *What would I gain from meeting her for coffee?*

The last time I met her, we ended up in bed, all emotional, and she had lied to me about something important. I still wasn‚Äôt fully over her. Everything was so fresh, so how could I trust her again, even as a friend?

This was 6 weeks after we‚Äôd slept together and 10 weeks after the breakup.

I went to her city, did my job, fulfilled my contract, and kept my distance. I saw her around but didn‚Äôt meet up. She got more distant with each day I was there and even texted me one night at 1 AM, asking if we could still have that coffee. I replied that it was clear where we stood now in life, and I didn‚Äôt want to engage any further. **This was the best decision I made since the breakup.**

It doesn‚Äôt benefit you to stay in contact with your ex, especially when you‚Äôre the one who is the dumpee and are trying to move on. In an extreme case even if she was sorry and wanted to get back together, how could I trust her again? How could I trust her in a long-distance relationship? I wouldn‚Äôt trust her living in the same city or under the same roof after everything. What guarantee is there she wouldn't  do the same again in a couple of months?

I ran into her one last time about a month ago by chance, in my city. She seemed sad when she saw me, and we exchanged a brief, awkward small talk. I went on with my day.

**Am I still angry with her?** A little, yes but it is getting less every day. I wish her the best and that she finds happiness in her life. That is the key to heal fully when you are in the acceptance stage.¬†

So, if you‚Äôre going through something similar‚Äîcut contact, and don‚Äôt look back. I know it‚Äôs incredibly hard. She still comes to my mind every day, but less and less with each passing day. Accept that it hurts, allow yourself to feel it, but don‚Äôt fantasize about how things could have been different. **Those memories are dead, and so is the relationship.**

And whatever you do, don‚Äôt try to fill the void with one night stands or rebound relationships. I‚Äôm grateful I didn‚Äôt go down that road. Focus on improving yourself‚Äîmentally, physically, emotionally‚Äîand don't look for another partner.

If you focus on becoming the best version of yourself, when the time is right, you'll meet someone who‚Äôs worthy of being in your life. But for now, the most important relationship is the one you have with yourself. **DON‚ÄôT BE A CLINGY FOOL LIKE I WAS.**

If you have any questions or need more details, feel free to ask.

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1hah4c7,https://i.redd.it/q3tfl5m2dv5e1.png,My book launch,"Well yesterday (12-8-24) was my official book launch. It was nerve-wracking but nice. It was a very intimate group of people. I had planned for 30 and only about 1/2 that came. So that was really nice. And the out pour of emotion that came from the few group exercises that I had and the interpersonal conversations between strangers was amazing. 
Now I've got to wait for KDP to send me my Author copies so I can pass them out to people. But all in all an amazing feeling of accomplishment and being 2 steps from the finish line is a great feeling. Everything will be full circle once in able to hand deliver the copies to those who ordered them. I figure hand delivering them, adds an additional touch of personalization and allows for conversations to be had that might not have been appropriate for the launch party. 

I'm feeling rather greatful right now... and never want to do another book (as I've got the start of 3 manuscripts sitting on my desktop) ü§£ 

This morning as a self celebration, I went to my favorite little mom and pop Cafe and had some coffee and a big homemade sourdough cinnamon roll with gobs of frosting and just spent some time in quite reflection. ",3,1733770242.0,selfpublishing,2,0.71,False

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1hah2js,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hah2js/the_siren_of_south_beach/,The Siren Of South Beach ,"In the late summer of 1987, Miami pulsed with neon lights, sweaty bodies, and the ever-present stench of desperation. I‚Äôd been a detective on the force for twelve long, bloodstained years, chasing the American Dream one coke deal at a time. But the city wasn‚Äôt the same anymore. Miami had always been a city of masks, but now, even I couldn‚Äôt tell the difference between the monsters and the men.

It started with a call on a sweltering Tuesday night. A girl had gone missing from a seedy South Beach club called Eclipse. The owner, some hotshot named Marco, claimed she was last seen leaving with a man nobody could describe. Blond hair? Maybe. A leather jacket? Maybe not. People‚Äôs memories get fuzzy after four drinks and a line of powder.

Her name was Teresa Alonzo, 19, a dancer from Hialeah. The kind of girl who thought she‚Äôd come to Miami to make it big but wound up slinging drinks in a bikini instead. We found her car parked three blocks from the club, but no sign of her. That wasn‚Äôt unusual‚Äîpeople disappeared in Miami all the time. But then the second girl vanished, and the third. All of them were last seen at Eclipse.

Marco swore up and down he didn‚Äôt know anything, but the fear in his eyes said otherwise. He told me about rumors. Whispers about a woman who‚Äôd show up every few months, always in the same black dress, always alone. Men would approach her, drawn like moths to a flame, but she never left with anyone. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs bad luck,‚Äù Marco muttered, wringing his hands. ‚ÄúEvery time she shows up, someone disappears.‚Äù

The city didn‚Äôt believe in bad luck; it believed in deals and debts. Still, I decided to keep an eye on Eclipse.

The first night I sat outside the club, I didn‚Äôt see much‚Äîjust the usual parade of tourists and wannabes. But on the second night, I saw her.

She was stunning in a way that felt wrong, like a painting with colors that didn‚Äôt quite match. Her black dress clung to her like smoke, and her eyes glittered under the streetlights. Men turned to stare as she walked by, their conversations dying on their lips.

I followed her inside. The bass thumped through my chest as I watched her glide through the crowd. No drinks, no small talk. She just stood there, swaying slightly to the music, as if waiting for something.

I watched her for hours, but she didn‚Äôt approach anyone. Then, just as I was about to leave, her gaze snapped to mine. For a moment, I couldn‚Äôt move. Her eyes were dark, endless, like the deep ocean at night. And then she smiled.

I don‚Äôt remember leaving the club. One minute I was standing there, and the next, I was outside, drenched in sweat. My watch said it was 3 a.m., but it felt like no time had passed at all. My head throbbed, and I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôd narrowly escaped something terrible.

The next morning, a fisherman found Teresa‚Äôs body washed up on the shore. Her face was bloated, her limbs twisted, but her expression‚Ä¶ it was peaceful. Like she‚Äôd fallen asleep and drifted away.

The medical examiner said drowning, but the coroner‚Äôs office was backed up, and I never got to see the full report. By the time the second body turned up, I knew it wasn‚Äôt a coincidence. Both girls had the same serene look on their faces, like they‚Äôd seen something beautiful before they died.

I went back to Eclipse every night for a week, but the woman in black never returned. Marco told me she only came around when she was hungry.

It wasn‚Äôt until two weeks later that I saw her again. This time, she wasn‚Äôt at the club. She was standing at the edge of the pier, her dress fluttering in the breeze. She turned when she saw me, her smile soft and knowing.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting for you,‚Äù she said. Her voice was like a melody I couldn‚Äôt quite place, haunting and familiar.

I should‚Äôve walked away. Called for backup. Anything but what I did next. But her eyes‚Ä¶ they drew me in, and before I knew it, I was standing next to her.

‚ÄúYou want to know what happened to those girls,‚Äù she said, tilting her head. ‚ÄúI can show you.‚Äù

She reached out, her fingers brushing mine, and suddenly I wasn‚Äôt on the pier anymore. I was underwater, surrounded by darkness. Her face was the only thing I could see, her eyes glowing like twin lighthouses in the abyss.

‚ÄúThey wanted to be free,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúAnd I gave them that.‚Äù

I gasped, water flooding my lungs. Panic set in as I thrashed, but her hands were on my shoulders, holding me still. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fight it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beautiful if you let it be.‚Äù

I woke up on the beach at dawn, coughing up salt water. My lungs burned with every breath, my head pounding like a bassline from Eclipse. The first thing I noticed was my gun and badge were gone. The second was the black feather clutched in my hand, slick and damp like it had been pulled straight from the ocean.

For a long time, I just lay there, staring at the sunrise, wondering if I‚Äôd lost my mind. But madness didn‚Äôt feel this sharp, this real. The memory of her voice‚Äîsoft, sweet, and just wrong enough to chill my bones‚Äîclung to me like the salt on my skin.

When I finally stood, my legs felt unsteady, like they didn‚Äôt belong to me anymore. Every instinct screamed to leave it alone, to let the ocean keep its secrets. But Teresa, and the other girls, didn‚Äôt have that choice.

I walked back to my car, dripping water onto the leather seats, and headed for the station.

The station buzzed with the usual chaos: radios squawking, phones ringing, rookies running errands for veterans who hadn‚Äôt left their desks in decades. Nobody even blinked as I walked in, soaked to the bone and looking like death warmed over.

Lieutenant Perry glanced up from his paperwork. ‚ÄúJesus Christ, Knox. You take a swim on the way in?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething like that,‚Äù I muttered, heading for my desk.

I dropped into my chair, the springs groaning under my weight, and stared at the feather. It was longer than I‚Äôd thought, sleek and dark with an oily sheen that caught the light in strange ways. It didn‚Äôt look like it belonged to any bird I‚Äôd ever seen.

Perry wandered over, coffee in hand. ‚ÄúYou look like you‚Äôve been through the wringer. What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

I hesitated. How the hell was I supposed to explain any of this? ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been following a lead on the missing girls from Eclipse,‚Äù I said finally.

‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I think there‚Äôs something we‚Äôre missing.‚Äù

Perry raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething‚Ä¶ not normal.‚Äù

His expression soured. ‚ÄúKnox, if you‚Äôre about to tell me you‚Äôve gone full ghost hunter, save it. We deal in facts, not fairy tales.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen explain this.‚Äù I held up the feather.

Perry frowned, leaning closer. ‚ÄúWhat is that, from a seagull or something?‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I found it this morning, after‚Ä¶‚Äù I trailed off. There were no words that wouldn‚Äôt make me sound insane.

‚ÄúAfter what?‚Äù

‚ÄúAfter I followed her.‚Äù

Perry stiffened. ‚ÄúHer?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe woman in black. The one the club owner keeps talking about.‚Äù

He sighed, rubbing his temples. ‚ÄúKnox, you‚Äôve been chasing shadows ever since this case landed on your desk. Maybe you need a break.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need a break,‚Äù I snapped. ‚ÄúI need answers.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen find me something solid. Something I can put in a report. Otherwise, you‚Äôre just wasting everyone‚Äôs time.‚Äù

I wanted to argue, but what could I say? That I‚Äôd been dragged into the ocean by a woman who might not even be human? That I‚Äôd felt her pull me into a darkness so vast it made the Miami skyline look like a toy? Perry would‚Äôve had me on mandatory leave before I finished the sentence.

Instead, I tucked the feather into my pocket and stood. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get you something solid,‚Äù I said.

I spent the rest of the day combing through the case files, looking for patterns, anything I might have missed. Every victim had been last seen at Eclipse, but their lives before that were unremarkable. Students, waitresses, tourists. None of them had anything in common, except where they died.

The ocean.

By the time the sun set, I had a new theory, one I didn‚Äôt like but couldn‚Äôt ignore. Whatever this thing was‚Äîthis woman, this predator‚Äîshe wasn‚Äôt hunting at Eclipse because it was convenient. She was hunting there because it was close to the water.

I drove back to the club that night, parking in the same spot I‚Äôd used before. The neon sign flickered overhead as I stepped inside, the bass rattling my ribcage. The crowd looked the same as always: young, reckless, and oblivious.

Marco spotted me from behind the bar, his face pale. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be here,‚Äù he said when I approached.

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt like people who ask questions.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. I have plenty.‚Äù

Marco glanced around, lowering his voice. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get it, man. She‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ normal. She‚Äôs something else. And if you keep poking around, she‚Äôll come for you, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe already did,‚Äù I said, pulling the feather from my pocket. ‚ÄúWhat is she?‚Äù

Marco stared at it, his hands trembling. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. A demon, maybe. A curse. All I know is, she always gets what she wants.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what does she want?‚Äù

His eyes met mine, haunted. ‚ÄúSouls.‚Äù

Before I could press him further, the air in the room shifted. The music seemed to fade, the crowd parting like the tide. And there she was, standing in the middle of the dance floor, her black dress shimmering under the lights.

She turned, her gaze locking onto mine, and smiled.

This time, I didn‚Äôt look away.

Her smile was the kind of thing that promised comfort and destruction all at once. It was disarming, like the pull of a riptide‚Äîgentle at first, then inescapable. She took a single step toward me, and the room seemed to contract, the air growing heavy, the lights dimming.

Marco grabbed my arm, his grip surprisingly strong. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù he hissed. ‚ÄúIf you go to her, you‚Äôre done.‚Äù

I shook him off and stepped forward.

Her eyes glinted with something between amusement and hunger as I approached. Up close, she was even more otherworldly. Her skin was flawless, her hair impossibly black, and her presence felt larger than her body, like she was barely containing something vast and ancient within.

‚ÄúDetective,‚Äù she said, her voice smooth and musical, cutting through the ambient noise like a blade. ‚ÄúI was wondering when you‚Äôd find your way back to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been expecting me?‚Äù I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

She tilted her head, studying me. ‚ÄúOf course. You‚Äôve been chasing me, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been chasing the truth.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what do you think you‚Äôve found?‚Äù

I pulled the black feather from my pocket and held it up. Her smile widened, and for the first time, I noticed her teeth‚Äîperfect, white, and just a little too sharp.

‚ÄúInteresting,‚Äù she murmured. ‚ÄúMost men wouldn‚Äôt have made it this far. You‚Äôre stubborn. I like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here for compliments,‚Äù I said, my voice firmer now. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for answers. What did you do to those girls?‚Äù

Her laughter was soft, almost pitying. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do anything to them. I gave them what they wanted.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt want to die.‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt they?‚Äù she asked, her tone turning sharp. ‚ÄúThey came to me, every one of them. They wanted escape. Freedom. And I gave it to them.‚Äù

‚ÄúFreedom?‚Äù I scoffed. ‚ÄúYou dragged them into the ocean and killed them.‚Äù

Her smile faltered, just for a moment, and the temperature in the room seemed to drop. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand, Detective,‚Äù she said, her voice colder now. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt kill. I release. The ocean is vast and eternal. It‚Äôs mercy.‚Äù

‚ÄúBullshit,‚Äù I snapped. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt choose this.‚Äù

She stepped closer, so close I could feel the chill radiating off her. ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre so different, don‚Äôt you? But I see it in your eyes, the weight you carry. You‚Äôve seen the worst of this world, and it‚Äôs hollowed you out. Tell me, Detective‚Äîwhat‚Äôs keeping you tethered?‚Äù

My breath hitched. For a moment, I couldn‚Äôt answer. She wasn‚Äôt wrong. Miami had chewed me up and spit me out long ago. The only thing keeping me going was a stubborn refusal to quit.

She leaned in, her voice a whisper now. ‚ÄúI can make it all go away. No pain, no fear, no emptiness. Just peace.‚Äù

For a split second, I considered it. The weight in my chest lightened, and her words wrapped around me like a warm tide. But then I thought of Teresa, her lifeless body on the shore. The girls who‚Äôd come before her. And I realized what this was: a lie wrapped in beauty.

I stepped back, breaking whatever spell she‚Äôd cast. Her eyes flashed with something dangerous, and the room seemed to shudder.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre stronger than I thought,‚Äù she said, her voice low and dark. ‚ÄúBut strength only delays the inevitable.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that a threat?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a promise,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll come back to me, Detective. They always do.‚Äù

Before I could respond, she turned and walked toward the back of the club. I followed, shoving my way through the crowd, but by the time I reached the door she‚Äôd disappeared into, it was empty. Just a narrow hallway leading to a locked emergency exit.

I stood there for a long time, staring at the door, my pulse hammering in my ears. She was gone, but her presence lingered, like the scent of the ocean on a stormy night.

When I finally left the club, Marco caught me at the door.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not done with you,‚Äù he said, his voice shaking. ‚ÄúOnce she sets her sights on you, it‚Äôs only a matter of time.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see about that,‚Äù I said, but the truth was, I wasn‚Äôt so sure.

As I drove away, the black feather sat on the passenger seat, glinting in the faint glow of the dashboard lights.

I told myself I‚Äôd fight her. That I wouldn‚Äôt give in.

But deep down, I knew she was right.

They always come back.

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night. Instead, I sat at my kitchen table, staring at the black feather and nursing a bottle of whiskey. Her words echoed in my head, a seductive melody I couldn‚Äôt shake.

What‚Äôs keeping you tethered?

By morning, the feather had dried completely. It felt brittle, lighter than it should have been. Against my better judgment, I drove to the department‚Äôs evidence lab and had it tested. No one asked questions‚Äîanother perk of being a veteran detective with a reputation for being unapproachable.

Two days later, the results came back.

The lab tech, a wiry kid named Ruiz, handed me the report with a confused expression. ‚ÄúWe ran every test we‚Äôve got,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis thing‚Äôs weird, Knox. The structure doesn‚Äôt match any known bird or animal. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ synthetic, almost, but not exactly. Like it was made out of something we don‚Äôt have a name for.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot possible,‚Äù I said, though the pit in my stomach told me otherwise.

Ruiz shrugged. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought, too. But here‚Äôs the kicker‚Äîit‚Äôs emitting trace amounts of electromagnetic radiation. Barely detectable, but it‚Äôs there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù

He shook his head. ‚ÄúI have no idea. You‚Äôd have to ask a physicist. Or maybe a priest.‚Äù

I left without saying another word.

That night, I sat in my car outside Eclipse again, waiting. But she didn‚Äôt show. For weeks, I kept going back‚Äînight after night, always hoping, always dreading. She was gone, but her shadow hung over me like a storm cloud.

The city started to feel different. Colder, quieter, like it was holding its breath. People still went missing, but not from Eclipse. Not from the places she‚Äôd haunted. It was as if she‚Äôd moved on.

Or as if she was waiting.

A month later, I found a black feather on my doorstep. It wasn‚Äôt like the first one‚Äîit was longer, sharper, its edges almost metallic.

I picked it up carefully, feeling a faint hum beneath my fingertips. It was warm, pulsing faintly like a heartbeat. And I knew, in that moment, that she hadn‚Äôt forgotten about me.

Her voice whispered in the back of my mind, soft and insistent.

They always come back.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do when she calls again. Maybe I‚Äôll fight. Maybe I won‚Äôt.

But if you ever find yourself walking alone at night, near the water, and you hear a voice singing softly on the breeze‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt follow it.

Because if you do, you won‚Äôt come back.

And if you do come back, you won‚Äôt be the same.

1hah24g,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1hah24g/its_been_2_decades_since_ive_cruised_a_few/,It's been 2 decades since I've cruised.. A few questions about an upcoming cruise,"We're sailing on Brilliance out of NOLA to Cozumel, Porta Costa and Grand Cayman.

I vaguely remember what cruising was like (I *think* I was on Navigator-- it was in the southern caribbean)

Neither of us (40's) are really big drinkers... on an agressive night out we'll have 4 or 5 drinks if we're really going hard.  Usually 1-2 if we do a date night out. I cannot imagine that the drink package (x2? really?? we HAVE to buy both?) is worth it at something like $700.  We DO love a cup of coffee in the morning, but as I understand there are several places to get a cup of coffee or tea included.  I can drink water all day and be happy, we really don't do soda.

Question 1: if we grab a bottle of wine at a duty free (or whatever--local) shop during excursions... first off, can we do that? would we be allowed to bring it back on board?  I'm thinking that a bottle of wine is MORE than enough to get us through a day, or at least a dinner. Secondly, do they charge ridiculous costs at the local shops because tourist?

Question 2: I'd assume water is free... can I use a refillable bottle? is bottled water free? if not, is the water onboard ok to drink without giving me the trots?

Also.. I'd REALLY like to unplug completely while we're there, so I can't imagine wanting a WiFi package, especially at the prices. I could BUY a starlink for less (nearly).

Question 3: will there be cell service at the ports? updates/backups would be nice to do, especially if we need to download a new Kindle book, or album to listen to, but not so needed that I can't just live without for that price.

Question 4: If I do NOT purchase a data package... can cell calls be made? We have daughters, granted they are adults, but just in case anything happens, it'd be nice for them to be able to reach us.

And lastly, we're doing this on a bit of a budget... actually that's BS... we're on a shoestring... Health care in the US, don't get me started... anyway, if you had to pick ONE (or even 2) excursions, what are the ""don't miss"" ones along this route?  We like museums, historical sites, tours of distilleries, great views of nature.. not huge on shopping, getting hammered or partying. Some swimming would be ok, but extremely physical things we'd probably steer away from.

THANK YOU!!!!



EDIT TO ASK:

How much would I expect to pay for a ""starbucks"" style coffee (more than just cream)?

Same question for a non-alcoholic drink (like a smoothie), and for a basic cocktail or Old Fashioned?

1hah0cg,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1hah0cg/central_texas_wedding_cost_breakdown_18000_for/,"Central Texas Wedding Cost Breakdown. $18,000 for 100 guests. This includes a beautiful venue, 2 wedding coordinators, all rentals, decor, florals, a violinist, DJ, full service buffet style catering, full service latte bar, photographer & videographer, and my wedding dress and his suit. ","We are estimating just under $18k for 100 guests. We will be married Spring of 2025. ‚ù§Ô∏è 

This forum has been so helpful as we‚Äôve planned our wedding and hopefully this helps someone else. Here is a breakdown of our costs and an explanation of each cost and any money saving tips that I used.

We are paying for everything ourselves and with the exception of me DIY‚Äôing our centerpieces, we are using a professional for all other services. Though we had a goal of staying around $15k, we are very pleased with the deals we‚Äôve gotten. The $18k includes everything except rings and the honeymoon. With the price of everything increasing in our current economy, I‚Äôm even more pleased with the cost of everything.

Venue: $5,500 for a 48 hour rental. We booked for a Wednesday & Thursday with the ceremony to be held Thursday night. Our guests live within a couple of hours for the most part, so a Thursday worked for us. The cost of a Friday & Saturday was $19,000!!! We had major savings by doing a weeknight. The venue includes all tables, chairs, cottages for the bride & groom for 48 hours (or two nights during the  event) and a day of event coordinator which is a game changer. All setup and cleanup is included in the package. 

Venue insurance & security: $600

Officiant: Free. Family friend.

Marriage license: $100.

Rehearsal dinner: $200. Chick-Fil-A!

Wedding day brunch for wedding party: Charcuterie boards, coffee, & fruit. $200 from H‚ÄëE‚ÄëB. 

DJ: $850. We found a great deal on a local DJ who gave us a discount for paying in full. 

Violinist: $775. She will play the ceremony and cocktail hour. This is a splurge for us. 

Linen rentals: $950. We went to the next town over (a smaller town than the one we are in) and saved HUNDREDS of dollars. The $950 includes satin tablecloths, flatware, chargers, glasses, and napkins. It also includes delivery and pickup. I really encourage getting multiple quotes. Our first quote from the rental place in town was nearly $1k and only included tablecloths and napkins. By going to a smaller town, the rate was so much better. We also got 10% off of this rate. I‚Äôm not sure how we got the discount, but it was a nice surprise!

Caterer: $3,200. This was a STEAL! Other quotes were double this. This rate includes non alcoholic drinks, passed appetizers, salads, rolls, entree with two sides, and a full dessert bar. We are using a caterer who does catering on the side instead of full time. The owner has her own venue in another city so she‚Äôs very familiar with the industry. Once again, we got a great deal for paying in full and she included free salad, rolls, and a dessert table. The dinner is buffet style and the price includes servers, acrylic plates and plastic ware, and table bussing. Our caterer is from a different part of the state and we saved a lot of money by looking outside of our region. 

Coffee bar: $600. Full service lattes for 100 guests with a customized menu and customized cups with our wedding logo included! Two baristas included for two hours of service. We are huge coffee lovers and this was a sweet idea for us. Again, by looking in a town about an hour away, I saved hundreds of dollars as some of the local for this were nearly $1,000 and didn‚Äôt include any extras.

Florals: $800. I am DIY‚Äôing part of this. Kroger is doing my floral arrangements for the wedding party and I‚Äôll be doing the centerpieces. Kroger is doing our arrangements and boutonni√®res for only $300! This includes my bouquet, three bridesmaids bouquets, and four boutonni√®res. The remaining $500 will be used table arrangements and baby‚Äôs breath to line the aisle.

Photograpy and Videography: $2,300. We got another great deal on this one. This includes our engagement session, 9 hours of photography on our wedding day, and 3 hours of videography for the ceremony and part of the reception. Our photographer threw in the videography for free for paying in full at the time of booking. 

Decor: $250 for signage, table numbers, etc.

Suit for him w/tailoring & dress shoes: $500 (got the suit on a Black Friday sale!)

My dress: The biggest splurge for me. $1,000. It retailed for $1,300 but I got it on sale for Black Friday. Tip: David‚Äôs Bridal has a 10% sale on all dresses more than $1,000 right now. You can layer an additional 15% off when you sign up for a free account and make your first purchase. It saved me $300 for my dream dress. I had no intention of spending more than $500 on my dress but fell in love with it!

Alterations: I‚Äôm budgeting $500 for this but haven‚Äôt had my first appointment yet.

That‚Äôs everything! I know it‚Äôs not under $10k but I‚Äôm very proud of how it‚Äôs all come together and the deals we‚Äôve managed to find for such great prices. We have friends who‚Äôve been married in the past year or so who‚Äôve spent much more than this for the same size of event. Their weddings were GORGEOUS but there was no way we could shell out the $30k-$40k they spent.

1hagt9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/1hagt9g/persona_5_royal_a_review_from_someone_who_doesnt/,Persona 5 Royal - A Review From Someone Who Doesn't Like Anime ,"A well-told story has a funny ability to worm its way into your heart, leaving an impression on your pysche that can last a lifetime. Endearing characters, impossible obstacles, thought-provoking moral quandaries and an emotional bond that draws you in. These are the things that make a good story. These are the things that make you feel real emotion for a fictional character. These are the things that make you sit back and reflect on a journey you didn't even take. And these things are present in spades in Persona 5 Royal.

I don't like anime styles of storytelling. Not that I haven't seen any good anime - far from it. But when I compare the methods of storytelling used in anime and other Japanese media compared to Western media, I tend to prefer Western media. The literal interpretation of emotional or subconscious elements. The over-explanation and spelling out of a character's thought process, compared to Western's preference to infer and study faces. The long monologues between protagonist and antagonist. The fanservice. The anime grunts. All of that is present in Persona 5 Royal. And at first, I really didn't think I liked it.

I also don't like JRPG's, specifically turn-based combat. I've played two I thought were good (Undertale and Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door), but I've found everything else, even Earthbound and Omori, to be far too boring and tedious. I like strategy and tactics, but I also like having feedback for my actions. There's something very unsatisfying about pressing a button to do an attack and then watching the attack. I'd rather just perform the attack myself. Not to mention the annoying amount of grinding normally required to level up so you can actually progress. Sometimes I'll see a game that looks cool, and then I realize it has turn-based combat, and be sad because I know I won't like it.

Persona 5 Royal proved to me that there is no such thing as bad gameplay - just bad execution. Because I loved the gameplay. I sunk my teeth deep into the turn-based combat. I spent dozens of hours grinding in Mementos to make super powerful personas that could one-shot anything I wanted. I got into the card system to customize them into whatever I wanted, making efficient use of alarms and incense. I loved riding around in my Morgana car slamming into enemies, hearing the satisfying popping sound of a character leveling up, studying movesets carefully to figure out combos between my party.

Here's the catch though: none of that would have been interesting without characters I cared about. If the characters are bland, basic and couldn't make me feel anything deeper than ""dang that's cool,"" then I'm not going to care if the enemy one-shots them. But if I feel emotionally invested in a character because they're trying to accomplish their dreams? ""NOOO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE YOU KILLED RYUJI!?!?!""

Some concepts of storytelling are so fundamental they transcend mediums, so whether it's Japanese or Western media they're still impactful. Atlus perfected the fundamentals. The characters in P5R are some of the most well-realized, human, true, vulnerable, and grounded characters I have ever had the joy to get to know in any video game. Ryuji, Ann, Morgana, Makoto, Futaba, Tae, Kasumi, Haru, Sojiro. These characters have more depth, heart and soul than just about anything I've played in the last ten years. And I know their stories will stick with me for another ten years.

If you're reading this and, like me, you don't like anime or JRPG's. Play it anyway. Give it a chance. Get through the Japanese weirdness so you can meet those characters, hear their stories, learn their dreams. Latch onto the turn-based mechanics, push them to their limits, tinker with movesets and combos. You'll come to see what a special little game this is.

And above all else: don't rush it. The game is a slow burn, so let it burn. Waltz your way through the calming streets and melancholy melodies of Japanese cityscapes. Ponder over a cup of coffee in a quiet caf√© as a clock ticks soothingly in the background. Watch the hustle and bustle of everyday folk rushing here and there in the underground subways. The game wants to take your hand and lead you on an adventure, so let it. Don't be afraid to take your time.",0,1733769485.0,patientgamers,8,0.42,False

Curious to know what you think about the relationship between coffee and meditation? I have a sense that it's taking the edge of my meditation practice and life in general. Find myself being easily distracted, procrastinating and don't get stuff done in time but also being more anxious in various situations and less joyful and less in the moment.

We both recently graduated college, I‚Äôm working back at home while she‚Äôs doing a grad year at school (so we‚Äôre away from each other). I‚Äôll provide some context on our relationship. (Long post, sorry).

We were in the same friend group but didn‚Äôt know each other well until we had a few classes together. Through that, we became super close really quickly and practically became inseparable. If anyone saw me around on campus odds are she was with me. We spent a lot of time together just us two - watching tv shows, grabbing lunch, getting coffee, etc. She instantly became one of my best friends. But, I started to develop strong feelings for her and I couldn‚Äôt tell if she felt the same. She was flirty with me and very touchy and would say stuff to me that made me think we might be more than friends. Plus, everyone around us just assumed we were dating and her own friends thought we eventually would.

So, I ended up asking her if she saw us as more. She said not really and that she doesn‚Äôt have the mental headspace for a relationship in college. So, that was that. Things were a little weird between us for a while but eventually we got past it as if I never asked.

But now, since we‚Äôve been away from each other, I feel like we‚Äôve gotten very close again. We ft every few weeks and I know I‚Äôm the only guy she‚Äôs talking to. Plus she‚Äôs been the one to say we have to meet up when she‚Äôs home for breaks, which usually I‚Äôd be the one to initiate that. We met up a week ago because she was home for a few days and it was so much fun. It made me realize how much I missed her. She kept emphasizing how much she missed me and kept suggesting things to do when she‚Äôs home again in a few weeks for winter break. I mean, she met up with me instead of her home friends or roommate who was around. So now I‚Äôm starting to wonder if she still just views me as a close friend or more? It‚Äôs just very unlike her to suggest meeting up so often as she always relies on others to make plans with her.

Do you think she maybe is starting to like me as more than a friend? I have heard that distance can sometimes create desire, so I guess it‚Äôs possible? Or am I reading too much into it?",1,1733769019.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

I (26M) met this girl (26F) last month who I was really interested in. She was the one the made the first move at the coffee shop and came up to me to talk. We had a brief but entertaining conversation so we exchanged numbers and told her that I would like to see her again. We texted almost everyday between when we met and our first date. A week later we go on a date which went great, we pretty much spent the whole afternoon together. She told me that she was interested in getting to know me better and that she would like to go on a second date, which i agreed. The week after our first date we barely talked which was fine cause I was busy and so was she. I messaged her later in the week to set up our second date, that day she left me on read pretty much all day and when she did replied she completely ignored the text I had sent her and only apologized for not getting back to me and told me that work was really busy and that she was stressed about a business trip that she had coming up. I told her it was fine and wished her an easier week, i didn‚Äôt bring up the second date again.

She was traveling for work for the next two weeks so the day she left I wished her a good trip and we had brief convo thru text, which i think went well. She was very responsive and seem to take it well that I texted her. I wasn‚Äôt expecting her to reach out during her trip cause i knew she would be busy etc but i was expecting her to reach out after she got back. At this point she had never initiated a convo once, it was always me who was texting first. Anyways, at this point its been a week since she got back from her trip and still no text so I chalked up as that we lost momentum during those 3 weeks of not talking and she moved on. But she actually messaged me this morning (its been two weeks now since she got back) telling me to have a good week and that we should see each other soon. 

Im conflicted cause my friends are telling me she pretty much ghosted me for a month and now she‚Äôs trying to rekindle the connection. And while I agree, i do remember her telling me that these next two months are always really busy and she doesn‚Äôt really have much time to do anything else besides work. Ive been thinking about giving it another shot cause she was a really nice girl but then again she did mentioned that she was an avoidant so maybe she was playing me all long?

1hagfla,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hagfla/travels_in_tanzania/,Travels in Tanzania,"I had a really hard time finding trip reports from Tanzania on thos forum. I'm sure they exist but I mostly only found people posting questions, so here's mine!

I left for Tanzania on September 12th from Houston, TX and returned on September 23rd. It was a terribly long flight with really long layover in Doha, overall took about 36 hours in each direction. The flight is really cool though, you go right past the summit of Kilimanjaro, it was amazing to see.

I booked a tour, I had never been to Africa and I was very worried about safety, especially with my camera. In hind site this was unnecessary, it was very safe and they are VERY protective of tourists.

I was basically only interested in animals, so I booked the whole tour as safari. Entrances to the national parks are expensive so this included some side trips to tribes and some areas to hike with Rangers, which were very interesting. They also all love birds and animals and it was great to get local knowledge.

I felt like I was in Lion King the entire time I was there. The parks are beyond gorgeous and the VARIETY of animals is just outstanding. Unbeatable. I was also lucky that though I booked a group tour, I was the only one on it so it was a private tour. I could take as long as I wanted with each animal, which was usually quite a while.

I think Tanzania is an absolutely perfect travel destination for a solo female traveler. Everyone was friendly but not overly friendly, they were perfectly happy to let me do my own thing and chat in Swahili while I photographed birds. The food was great, the coffee was outstanding and the beer was cheap and tasty.

Compared to most people on this forum, I definitely spent a bit extra to have the best experience. It was probably about 10k total, including things like visa and clothes and shots, but I had a private tour and stayed in luxury lodges and just felt amazing every minute of the trip. You could do it a lot cheaper with camping safari, or a LOT more expensive with flying between locations rather than driving. 

It was a lot of driving but I enjoyed that too, you see the people's daily lives and some very rural locations. You also see where the tribes like the Massai live which was really interesting, and there are animals along the road as well. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the serengeti to anyone who loves animals and has a tendency towards anxiety, they handle everything. I would warn that it's hard to do Tanzania truly cheap, entrance to the parks can be 500$ a day and neither the souvenirs or the food is particularly cheap.",25,1733768577.0,travel,27,0.91,False

Hey all!

I just came back from one week in Madeira with my girlfriend and I thought I'd do a trip report. Hopefully you'll find this useful if you're also planning a vacation to this beautiful island.

Now, let's start from a bit of context: we are a couple in our early 30s, no kids, quite active and outdoorsy (at least I am, the missus mostly comes along), wouldn't call us ""foodies"" but we like to eat good food, not really into nightlife.

We live in the cold and damp Netherlands so every year we make it a priority to visit some place warm for a week in winter. First it was Lanzarote, then Morocco, this time it's Madeira!

First things first: total cost of vacation. I did not keep a strict budget, but I can see from my bank account that overall this week cost us around 2k for 2 people, for 1 week. This includes the rental of a car for 7 days, full insurance, accommodation, fuel, parking, snacks/groceries and one meal at a restaurant every day. I'd say that it's not the cheapest place I've visited, but still perfectly reasonable considering the quality and service that we received. Your opinion might be different, according to your expectations and past experiences. Anyway, I'll add more details in the ""Price"" section below.

# Itinerary

* Day 1: Arrival and general getting acquainted with the place.

* Day 2: PR 6/6.1, Fanal Forest & South coast road trip (Cape Gir√£o, Ribeira Brava, Ponta do Sol, Cascata dos Anjos).

* Day 3: PR 8 & Santana.

* Day 4: West coast road trip, with stops at Miradouro da Boa Morte, Miradouro do Ponta da Ladeira, Porto Moniz and the natural swimming pools, Seixal and the black beach, Sao Vicente. Additionally there are other viewpoints along the road (Miradouro Ilheus da Ribeira da Janela, Miradouro da Eira da Achada, Miradouro do V√©u da Noiva that might be worth a stop.

* Day 5: PR 1 & Garajau beach.

* Day 6: Sightseeing in Funchal & Funchal Botanical Garden.

* Day 7: Little bit of souvenir shopping and returning home.

My original itinerary was more packed and a bit more efficient with the routes, but I had to be flexible and leave room for changes to accommodate for bad weather conditions and general tiredness/happiness of my partner. I believe that if you‚Äôre alone and like to have intense vacations, you could squeeze the above itinerary in 5 days.

We had originally planned to do PR 9, PR11 and PR 1.2 as well, but unfortunately a mix of bad weather (and a rock fall/landslide for PR9!) prevented us from doing them.¬†

# Hikes, also known as levadas and veredas

Madeira has a great network of trails, divided into levadas and veredas. Levadas follow water canals used for irrigation, and are usually surrounded by forests. Veredas, on the other hand, are more similar to mountain and cliff trails you might find in other places in Europe. We did 4:

* PR 1: Vereda do Areeiro. Vote 9/10, only because it‚Äôs currently closed. If it was open all the way, this would easily be a 1010.
* PR 8: Vereda da Ponta de S√£o Louren√ßo. Vote 8/10. Spectacular hike, but way too crowded around lunchtime.
* PR 6/6.1: Levada das 25 Fontes - Raba√ßal - Levada of Risco. Vote 6/10. The 2 waterfalls are gorgeous, but the hike is incredibly boring.¬†
* Vereda do Larano - Boca do Risco. Vote 6/10. Basically same as above: beautiful views, but very boring hikes. No elevation, no challenge, mostly a single line trail in a forest.

I‚Äôm a passionate hiker so I could write a lot about our experience. If I have to summarize, I‚Äôd say: the hikes are easy, safe and well indicated. They are easily accessible so they get very crowded around midday. We always went in the morning and left at lunch. Some of them are so accessible that you‚Äôll find hundreds of people, of all age and fitness, on the same path. Elevation is usually minimal and they can become quite muddy, which happened in our case. Trail runners or approach shoes are recommended.

If I have to give a vote go hiking in Madeira, I‚Äôd say 7/10. The views and landscape from the hikes are spectacular, but unfortunately they can get so crowded that you really miss the feeling of wilderness and nature. Furthermore, there‚Äôs very little challenge in the terrain, so the walking can get a bit boring and repetitive. If you find excitement in a physical challenge, you'll not find it here. They are a pleasant walk in the woods, not really a hike with lots of ascent and fatigue.

In case you‚Äôre interested, I‚Äôve written a review for each hike on AllTrails in details.

# Food

I vote the food quality as a solid 8.5/10. We liked some places more than others, but we never actually disliked any place we went to. My girlfriend had mostly fish and seafood, I also tried some meat. We tried:

* Bela 5 Snack Bar (Funchal): good food, big portions, super friendly owners. We were crazy for their maracuja cheesecake, which tastes more like panna cotta than cheesecake, but you won‚Äôt hear me complaining, as it was really good. I also had their Prego 5 special sandwich, which I could have easily eaten every day for how good it was.

* Restaurante Londres (Funchal): canteen-style restaurant. Friendly service and huge portions. I had the pepper steak which was pretty good, but overall we were not super fans of the rest.
* Snack Bar A Pipa: really good food. I tried both their prego sandwich and espetada. Huge fan of both. My girlfriend had fish, mussels and prawns. We actually came here twice since we liked it so much.
* Restaurante Marisqueira O Barqueiro: decent food. Slightly more expensive than the rest. I‚Äôd say 6/10, you can find much better on the island.

Since my girlfriend really wanted to eat seafood every day, we skipped Central Grill and Santo Antonio, but if I were alone I would have definitely tried them.

Madeira also has absolutely fantastic fruits. We tried maracuja, local madeiran banana, mango, papaya, melon, dragon fruit, monstera deliciosa, etc. Easily a 10/10 for me.

You cannot miss their sweets as well. I had at least 2 pasteis de nata and queijada everyday.

Don‚Äôt skip their Brisa (a local passion fruit soft drink that tastes like fizzy ACE juice) and Coral (very light local lager beer).

# Accommodation

We stayed in Calheta. If I could go back I would probably stay around Funchal, since basically all of the places that we wanted to visit on our itinerary were on the east side of the island, which meant almost 1 extra hour of driving every day. Unfortunately, when I booked the accommodation, I had not done the itinerary yet. Then life happened, I got busy and I was not able to change hotel to better suit our plans. Well, you live and learn.

# Driving

Let me preface by saying that driving in Madeira is not as bad as you might have heard.¬†

If you‚Äôre used to 6-lane highways you might find it a bit challenging, but if you‚Äôve driven anywhere in the Alps then you won‚Äôt see much difference. Think of the roads in Scotland, only steeper and with better road quality.

We rented a car from a local rental agency. We spent 200 euros for the weekly rental and the full insurance for peace of mind. That way, I did not have to leave a deposit. A quick search on google showed that most car rental agencies in Madeira required 1 to 2 thousands euros of deposit, and I did not want to leave that.

We ended up with a 2023 (or 2024) Ford focus ST-line. I was quite happy with it: the car had enough juice to go uphill without a problem, and it was not too big to be an issue while parking or going through the narrow roads. I would not go with anything bigger, like a proper SUV.

In Funchal, paid parking is cheap and available, mostly paid by coins (but there‚Äôs also an app you can download). Free parking exists, but it‚Äôs usually inconvenient and far. There are a lot of underground paid parking lots in Funchal, which are more expensive than the ones outside, but it‚Äôs also much easier to find a free spot. Beware, some of them can be quite narrow. When hiking, parking is sometimes free and sometimes paid. Be careful when driving, as often people park on one side of the street, and magically a 2-way street becomes suddenly a 1-way street.

Traffic is not terrible but I noticed that people have a tendency to be pretty aggressive at the wheel. Just live and let live and you won‚Äôt have any issues. Gas has a reasonable price (1.55 e/l gasoline right now).¬†

# Prices

Prices were overall slightly higher than I expected to be honest, at least when compared to Lanzarote. But let me make a huge disclaimer: if you consider the gigantic portions of food, then suddenly prices become quite cheap. An appetizer costing 16 euros is not an issue if it feeds 3 people. Drinks and coffee were usually pretty cheap as well.

Overall, we usually spent 25 to 40 euros per person per meal, but ate so much that we only had 1 proper meal a day. So considering that, the per capita expenditure was actually quite low. Main dishes also usually includes 1 to 3 sides in the price (boiled vegetables, fries and rice).

# Locals

The people we met were extremely open, friendly and relaxed. We spoke mostly with service workers, but we always had a great experience. Everybody spoke great English.

# Weather & temperature

We were a bit unlucky with the weather, as it was quite variable. Sunny weather was quite warm (>25 C), but then you could be in 10 C if the rain decided to show. Just keep in mind that you‚Äôll have to bring some rain gear.

# To summarize

* What we liked: Food, friendliness, services, roads are (mostly) in excellent conditions. The landscape is out of this world, straight from Jurassic park. Overall, prices are reasonable. Shops are open until late at night (coming from a place where shops close at 5pm).

* Neither like nor dislike: Didn't see a lot of nightlife, but also didn't really look for it. Driving a car is more or less a must. Not a lot of free parking. Porto Moniz and Seixal were unimpressive. Not much to do besides outdoor activities, which can be a problem if the weather is particularly bad.

# What I could have done better

* Not stay in Calheta, but in Funchal instead.
* Visit another time of year for better weather, also to appreciate Porto Santo and whale sightings.
* Better pacing in my itinerary.",4,1733768442.0,travel,2,1.0,False

1hag9c9,https://www.reddit.com/r/doctorsUK/comments/1hag9c9/med_education_in_the_uk_why_consultants_dont/,Med education in the UK: why consultants don‚Äôt teach medical students?,"Ready to be downvoted but hear me out‚Ä¶. And hopefully share your thoughts. (Long rant coming)

I recently got some med students on the ward and taught them few bits here and there. It quickly transpired that for any procedural skill the most they could do is introduce themselves, wash hands, put gloves on, get patient consent‚Ä¶. And that‚Äôs pretty much it. They could barely talk me through any of the procedures, so I quickly left my hopes there and then and was basically explaining everything like I would to a lay man.

Then we got coffee and I started asking them about their med school and how things  are arranged there. [note I graduated abroad].
Turns out, all procedures are taught by nurse educators (I never knew these existed), who work full time at Uni, so don‚Äôt practice any longer. Their lectures have some prof‚Äôs name on them but they got taught by some other staff (?!). All the profs they know are honorary, i.e. not paid. One student knew only one prof paid by Uni due to their research interest and that prof was only supervising PhD students and doing research but not teaching med students.

When I started asking more and more it turned out these poor souls rarely get any practicing clinicians to teach them. So, my question is‚Ä¶ who teaches them???

Why nurse educators on 60-70k/yr teach students instead of clinicians? It would be even cheaper!

Get an NHS cons to teach students 2 days/week and 3 days/ week clinical. Instead my bosses are buried under shitty admin and whatnot. You can easily get semi-useless Karen to do the admin for bosses rather than teach future medics.

You can even get the retired ol‚Äô school surgeon to teach anatomy, or the retired anaesthetic cons to teach physiology. 

Why is it the case that Karen who once got signed of for canula, now teaches med students when she can barely put a canula on a dummy? But rather forces students to learn like mantra how to wash hands and introduce. 

Am I missing something here? Or what‚Äôs the deal with UK med schools?",65,1733768141.0,doctorsUK,44,0.89,False

I'm a 26 year old guy from Florida, here in search of a special connection! 

If you're looking for someone to talk to about your day, or your hobbies, or your special interests, or the things that grind your gears, or just to babble about nonsense at nonsensical hours, you've come to the right place! I want someone I can share everything with, from thoughts to feelings to experiences to coffee. 

So a lil bit more about me, I work in retail management, it's not exactly a blast but it keeps me fed for the time being. Still searching for my true passion in life, although the exploration process is kind of fun in and of itself. I am neurodivergent and quite a goofball, and I tend to get a bit anxious from time to time. I am mostly introverted but I love going out with close friends. I am a pretty big Nintendo fan, and I would love to find someone who loves Pok√©mon as much as I do. Major points if you tell me who your favorite is in your message heh. I enjoy a variety of hobbies from gardening to baking to juggling. I adore animals and I have a very round cat. I am super into tattoos and piercings and have some of each. I have reeeeeally long hair.

Some of the things I value most in a person are kindness and empathy. If you're a sweetheart who loves seeing people feel happy, you should absolutely send me a message!
