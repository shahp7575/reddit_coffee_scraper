1kr8ta6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kr8ta6,Rory Gilmore is a reflection of Lorelai’s emotional damage—and it’s not as cute as the show pretends,"Lorelai and Rory are emotionally avoidant mirrors of each other, and the show never holds them accountable.

I’ve rewatched Gilmore Girls enough times to say this with confidence: Rory is not some innocent golden child who “lost her way.” She is a direct product of Lorelai’s unresolved emotional issues and in many ways, she’s even worse. Behind the cozy Stars Hollow setting, witty banter, and coffee addiction is a mirror: Lorelai and Rory are the same emotionally avoidant, selfish partner in different fonts.

Let’s start with Lorelai. Lorelai never really takes accountability in her relationships. Her dynamic with Christopher is incredibly toxic. They sleep together while he’s with Sherry, she acts like nothing happened, and still plays nice with Sherry after. And let’s not forget the absolute whiplash of her sleeping with Christopher literally minutes after breaking up with Luke. That wasn’t grief or confusion, that was emotional immaturity and impulse masked as ""following her heart"". She ghosted Max Medina before their wedding, ran away from commitment constantly, and despite everything Luke did for her, she turned to Christopher again the moment things got difficult. She masks her avoidance with humor and charm, but she is emotionally unavailable and always runs when it matters.

Now look at Rory. Her pattern eerily mimics her mother’s. At first, she’s framed as this sweet, brainy girl who’s mature for her age. But in black and white she emotionally cheats on Dean with Jess, then physically cheats with Dean while he’s married. She strings Jess along for emotional support, cheats on Logan with Jess, then later has an affair with Logan while he’s engaged—and she’s got a boyfriend she literally forgets exists (Paul). She doesn’t communicate, avoids conflict, and when confronted with the consequences of her actions, she either spirals or shrugs it off.

It’s the same behavior as Lorelai’s. Both women:

- Avoid emotional accountability
- Cheat or emotionally betray their partners
- Use humor or detachment to avoid conflict
- Romanticise dysfunction and chaos
- Sabotage stable relationships when they get too      real

And the show doesn’t really call them out on it. That’s the part that frustrates me. It lets the soft lighting and music lull you into thinking it’s all okay. But if this show had the tone of Euphoria or The Bear or Normal People, people would be tearing Rory and Lorelai apart for their toxicity. Their behavior would be shown as damaging and self-sabotaging, not endearing.

What makes it even sadder is that Rory didn’t stand a chance. She was raised to be Lorelai 2.0. Same traumas, same patterns, same lack of accountability. Lorelai wanted Rory to “be better,” but she never modeled what emotional health or honest communication looked like. So Rory learned to run, to lie, to cheat, and to center her own feelings over others’ pain—just like her mom.

It’s not quirky. It’s generational trauma masked in indie music and takeout containers.
The show’s aesthetic can be deceiving. It's comforting, yes, but under the vintage coffee mugs and bookstore charm is a story about two women stuck in patterns they never fully escape. And while Gilmore Girls doesn’t always hold them accountable, that’s what makes it so fun to dig deeper as a viewer. These characters aren’t meant to be perfect which makes analysing them a lot more interesting.

Short Bible Study with me about Matthew 22:39

Introduction
------------

Welcome to a journey through one of the most powerful messages in the Bible, found in Matthew 22:39. Imagine a world where love is the cornerstone of every interaction, where kindness and empathy build bridges, and where relationships flourish under the nurturing light of compassion. This is not just a distant dream; it’s a divine calling, a command beautifully summarized in this single verse. Get ready to explore how this timeless truth can transform your relationships and infuse your life with purpose.

Have you ever wondered how to make a real difference in the lives of those around you? The answer lies in a simple yet profound truth that is accessible to all of us. By loving others as ourselves, we become vessels of positive change, creating ripples of goodness that extend beyond our immediate circles. Let’s dive into the heart of this teaching and discover practical ways to live it out daily.

Bible Verse
-----------

“‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’” – Matthew 22:39 (NIV)

Meaning
-------

Matthew 22:39 is part of Jesus’ response when asked about the greatest commandment in the Law. After emphasizing the importance of loving God wholly, Jesus highlights this second commandment as equally foundational. This teaching is not just a moral suggestion; it’s a profound insight into the nature of God and His desires for human relationships.

Loving your neighbor as yourself implies an empathy and compassion that mirrors the care you naturally show to your own needs and desires. It’s about recognizing the inherent worth and dignity in every individual, seeing them through the same lens of care and consideration we use for ourselves. This commandment challenges us to extend our love beyond those who are easy to love, reaching out instead to everyone we encounter.

In a world often filled with division and strife, this verse calls us to build community and foster unity. It invites us to step out of our comfort zones and connect with others on a deeper level, sharing the love of Christ in practical, tangible ways.

Actions to Take
---------------

– Reach out to someone you haven’t spoken to in a while and rekindle that connection.

– Perform a random act of kindness, such as buying coffee for a stranger or writing a heartfelt note to a friend.

– Volunteer your time or resources to a local charity or community project.

– Reflect on your daily interactions and seek opportunities to show gratitude and appreciation.

– Practice active listening, giving others your full attention without distractions.

Journal Prompts
---------------

– How can I better love those around me as I love myself?

– What does loving my neighbor look like in my daily life?

– Reflect on a time when someone showed you love and kindness. How can you pay it forward?

– Identify areas in your life where you might need to extend more grace and empathy.

– Write about a neighbor (in any sense) you find challenging to love and pray for guidance on how to reach out.

Prayer
------

Dear Lord, thank You for the incredible gift of Your love and for the commandment to love my neighbor as myself. Please give me the strength and compassion to see others with Your eyes and to be a source of encouragement and light in their lives. Help me to demonstrate this love in meaningful ways each day. Amen.

Social Posts
------------

– “Love isn’t just what we say; it’s what we do. How can you love your neighbor today? #LoveYourNeighbor #Matthew2239”

– “A little love can change the world. Let’s start with our neighbors. ❤️ #ActOfKindness #Community”

– “Matthew 22:39 challenges us to love deeply and live fully. How are you living out this call? #FaithInAction”

– “Unity starts with us. Love your neighbor as yourself and watch the world transform. 🌎 #SpreadLove”

– “Let’s be the change we wish to see. Love your neighbor like never before. #InspireLove #Matthew2239”

Conclusion
----------

Matthew 22:39 invites us to embark on a journey of love and transformation. By loving our neighbors as ourselves, we unleash the power of Christ’s love in our communities, creating a ripple effect of grace and peace. This commandment, so deeply intertwined with our faith, encourages us to break barriers and build lasting connections.

Hey everyone! I recently rented my first solo apartment and have been trying to get my place furnished. I was able to get a lot of stuff off Facebook Marketplace, including everything in the picture. 

I need a coffee table, but I'm not sure what kind would be ideal -- any suggestions on style/shape/size that would work well? Ideally anything that isn't neutral or basic.

Also wondering if I should add some secondary seating (like a chair or ottoman). If so, what kind/color would pair well? I was thinking about an armchair near the window and an ottoman or bench on the opposite side, but would that clutter the space?

Then what he wakes up the top tells the bottom that he has been looking for him for years (like the guy seems very obsessive).

Today's coffee is from Little Owl in Denver. It's a medium-roasted, natural process Ethiopian Yrgacheffe. As noted on the box, they expect notes of cherry cordial, dark honey, and raspberry. 

**Process:**

* Grinder: Fellow Ode Gen 2 set to 7.2
* Brewer: Ceramic Origami with Kalita 185 filter paper
* Water: Rao-Perger recipe at 92°C (\~124 TDS, reverse-osmosis and remineralized)
* Brew Ratio: 15:1 (15g coffee to 225g water)
* Drawdown Time: almost exactly 3 minutes
* Additions: Just a touch of sugar (I like a little extra sweetness...sue me, lol.)

**Tasting notes:**

* Aroma: Milk chocolate and honey, maybe a hint of raspberry
* Flavor: You know those Queen Anne cherries..? It kinda reminds me of those, especially with just a touch of added sugar. Chocolate, a little sweet cherry, a little creaminess, slightly sweet, not so much raspberry as it cools down.
* Body: Medium to full, this definitely has more texture, which I really enjoy in a rich coffee like this one.

Overall, a very nice, rich, chocolatey cup of coffee with a little bit of dark fruit. I love this type of coffee, even as I start to explore brighter, funkier, and more acidic options out there. Definitely a winner.

I absolutely love good stories regardless of where they're found, which expands to enjoying meeting and talking to people. When I'm not teaching, I'm talking to students before and after class (often risking being late to my next class!) or meeting with students both current and former and talking about writing, life, and everything in between. It's a lot for an introvert like me, but I'm awful at saying no, and it is one of the aspects I enjoy most about the job.

That's enough about me. I'm trying to keep this shorter than my usual posts, which apparently is a struggle for me. I want to know about you! There's something to be appreciated about the raw honesty and vulnerability of meeting strangers online, so come say hi! Send me a message or chat request, and I don't mind moving to another messaging platform if that's to your preference.",2,1747756759.0,MeetPeople,0,1.0,False

Figure out what you want to do and make a list. That way you have options to pick from and don’t keep reusing the same date spots over and over again or figuring out last second. Throw some adventures on there that you’ve always wanted to do as well. Thinking about things ahead of time makes figuring out dates so much easier and gives you stuff to do by yourself if you’re ever feeling low or board.

Bonus points if you do it on an app where you can collaborate with your date.

Example(my current list):

First Date:

- The Cabin (lake side/lounge/walk/music/drinks+apps)

(Charolette)
- Midtown Park/Area(restraunts/breweries/coffee/parks/desert places/easy parking)

- Pisces Sushi Bar and Lounge (restaurant)
- Lost Worlds Brewing Charolette (Drinks/Lounge)

(Pineville)
- Margaux’s Wine, Pizza & Market (Great atmosphere/Lounge, Historic district, park nearby, coffee/icecream nearby)
- Water bean Coffee (Coffee, baked goods)(7am-7pm)

**Part 4**

I broke down crying there, as one of my neighbors who had seen me ran up and asked what was wrong. They drove me to my therapist appointment that day, in the state I was in. I didn’t want to go back to my apartment, even if it was to change. When I got there, she ran out and asked me if I was okay, and what happened. I looked down at myself to see that my nightgown was sopping wet, and coated with mud, and flower petals. She put down a sheet of plastic on the couch before I sat down. I told her about the dreams I started having. The man I saw at the cafe. She wrote me two prescriptions. A sleep assistant, and an anti-psychotic. She told me to get them filled immediately, so I did that. That night when I fell asleep, instead of being in the field once more, I woke up in my own bed after falling asleep. I couldn’t move. Sleep paralysis. The fairy man was staring at me from the corner of my room. He was sitting in a chair, but then he stood up. He dragged the chair over to me, and sat down once more. He caressed my cheek as tears fell, kissed my forehead, then turned into his smaller form and flew out the cracked open window. Then I opened my eyes and I was in my bed, the chair still next to it. It was my day off. I took a shower, got dressed in a dress that seemingly appeared out of thin air on top of my dresser, and knew what to do. I didn’t bother doing my makeup or even putting on shoes, I just opened my apartment door and started walking to the fairy ring. Once I got to it, I hesitated before I stepped inside. Once I was in, it felt like my reality shifted, and I sat in the center of it. The man from the coffee shop was across the street. He saw me, and walked over. He stopped just outside the ring. He jokingly asked 

“Why would you go inside this thing? Did your parents never tell you as a kid that the fairies would take you?”

1kr8f7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kr8f7k/anyone_else_feel_like_being_with_someone_new/,Anyone else feel like being with someone new helped?,"I know that a lot of posts on here talk about spending time alone, or treating the breakup like something you can “win” or “lose” and that the person who stays single the longest somehow proves their superiority in the relationship. And I’m not saying I disagree; you need to learn to live with yourself, support and love yourself, and be comfortable alone before you can invite someone back in. You need the time to move on. Flinging into rebounds, outside of just being an embarrassing look, will do more damage in the long run than the temporary pleasure they’d give you (though if someone needs to crash out, I’d never stop them from getting it out of their system). 

About six months after my 4 year relationship with my abusive ex ended, I started dating again. Couple dates and talking stages that went nowhere, and one situationship that after a little while I ultimately realized I wasn’t emotionally healed enough yet to be present for. And to clarify, I was not still in love with my ex. I did not want her back or to ever see or hear from/of her again. But i had not moved on from the mark that that relationship left on me, the good or the bad. I wouldn’t learn until after it ended and I started with a new therapist that I’ve been unknowingly grappling with severe PTSD as well as at least one personality disorder since I left. So, I vowed to stay single. Focus on me. Focus on building new friendships. If something comes, then it comes. 

At the 1 year post-breakup mark, I started spending time with a former coworker after chancing upon them in a coffee shop and reconnecting. Three or four hangouts later, they invite me back to their place and we have sex. Now, being in a position where we were friends first, they know what I’m going through. They know all but the goriest details of my relationship and breakup, and they understand the trauma I’m continuing to unpack and heal from. I’m not “over it”, but I’m not sitting here yearning for another woman. If anything I’m trying to wash her fingerprints off me still. But they understand. They also know that I’m moving abroad in 3~ months, so ultimately even if things do get a bit serious, we know that it has a shelf life and we both are okay with that. Just have fun and enjoy the moment, yknow?

They’re deeply empathetic and kind, something that I’m not used to from partners. We’re extremely compatible in most ways; interests, enjoyments, world view, sex, it’s almost disorienting because I told myself towards the end of my past relationship that for ever boundary crossed, every abuse lobbied against me, every night I spent crying, there was someone out there who would never treat me this way. For a few months after everything, I wondered if that was true and began to rue giving up the devil I knew for the chance that something better *might* come at the price of suffering alone now. But in a weird way, even if neither of us see some long term life to be built out of this, they have made me believe in the idea of loving other people again. 

It’s been a year so I wouldn’t call it a rebound. And I didn’t really seek it out, it kinda found me (I didn’t even think that they were attracted to guys when we struck up a friendship). And while I am scared and weary from feeling so stuck in the past due to what I went through, and wishing that I could achieve the necessary level of apathy towards this person from my past to move on with my life…I do actually feel like things are going to be okay. Maybe not now, and maybe not for some time. But starting over seems a lot less scary now that I know that the kindness and empathy and gentle love that I yearned for in my relationship is very much alive and out there waiting for me. 

I’m curious if anyone else went through a similar patch/connection after a breakup. Not some regretful self-destructive rebound, but a connection that actually felt healing, like you’ve regained a part of yourself within it, even if it’s just one step on the road to healing.

Currently looking for housing in Boston starting either 9/1 (or sooner if there's an option to renew a lease in fall). 

Currently, I work downtown in the Boston Harbor as a Deckhand and at a non-profit as a Career Coach, so I'm looking for housing close to the T (preferably the Red or Green Lines). I'm mostly interested in Allston/Brighton/Brookline, but I'd also consider Somerville, Cambridge, or southern parts of Medford. 

Ideally, I'm looking to budget under $1100 plus utilities, but that's slightly negotiable if it's a good fit. I'm hoping to find two roommates to keep costs down. 

My hobbies include boating, learning foreign languages (I'm really into Russian especially and attend language Meetups often), running, yoga, Irish dance, cooking/baking, playing MarioKart, and spending time exploring Boston and coffee shops.

I'm an extrovert who also likes to have friends over a few times a month and spends a lot of time outside the house at work and events. I'm not looking to live in a party house, but would definitely prefer a living situation where roommates are fairly social and enjoy movie nights or communal dinners often. I value clear communication between roommates and clean common areas, and am LGBTQ+ and pet friendly! 

Unfortunately I cannot be 420-friendly due to drug testing at my job. I also am bringing a sofa-bed with me.

We’re both in our mid-20s, neurodivergent, and studying. They really struggle with adult tasks like cleaning or buying things they need. They don’t have much of a support system, so I’ve tried to help, but it’s getting draining.

When I visited for their birthday, their room was buried in laundry and stuff everywhere. I didn’t say anything, but they asked if I noticed they’d cleaned, with a proud expression. I awkwardly said, “Yeah, I see you vacuumed!” Then I noticed their sofa had been half-assembled for a month. I offered to help. They said no.

So I made a deal. “If I beat you at this game, I get to help. If you win, I’ll buy dinner.” They agreed. I beat them two out of three. “Best out of five?” Sure. I won. Then mid-game, the sofa broke, turned out it wasn’t screwed together properly. They didn’t have any tools, so I ended up patching it with stuff we could borrow from a neighbor. The screws were too short and the sofa was clearly damaged. Still, I got one screw to hold it all together. My friend complained, but was happy in the end, and we finally got that drawer done. However they still didn’t want to buy any essential tools. Afterwards they mentioned needing a better laundry basket. I tossed the dirty clothes into the fixed sofas new drawer, to make the bed usable. They protested but thanked me afterwards.

A few weeks later, I asked if they’d bought the basket yet. Nope. I offered to help go get it. They weren’t into it, but agreed to go if I bought them a hotdog. At the store, they picked up a toilet brush, and I tried again to look at laundry baskets. They got annoyed and said they only agreed to “look.” At the register, I just bought the basket myself.

They gave me a look and asked if it was for myself. I said, tired, “No, it’s a gift for my friend.” Then after checkout they asked for the *most expensive* hotdog. I said I’d only cover a normal one. I got a coffee and they their hotdog. We chatted like usual after, and they took the basket home without comment.

I feel like an asshole. I crossed a line and didn’t respect their “no.” But I also know they would never have gotten it otherwise. It feels like I’ve become their parent instead of their friend, even with other stuff like disability aid, I’ve had to convince them just to consider applying, and now they’re ""waiting"" for me to help them with it.

I tried this online psychic reading thing, hoping for a bit of guidance during a rough patch, and it was such a letdown. I’m pissed I bought into their shiny promises. Here’s the deal, and maybe this’ll save someone else the headache.

Their site hypes up a “3 minutes free + 80% off” deal, which sounded cool. I’ve been stressed out with work and some personal stuff, so I figured a reading might give me a nudge in the right direction. They talk a big game about “vetted” psychics and crazy-high accuracy, but it started feeling like fluff real quick.

Signing up was a slog. They make you do this quiz to “match” you with a psychic, but it’s like those BuzzFeed quizzes that tell you what potato you are. I spent way too long answering questions, only to get a list of psychics who all do the same stuff—tarot, astrology, whatever. It didn’t feel like they cared about my answers. I picked one with good reviews, crossing my fingers for something useful.

The actual reading? Total flop. Their app crashed twice before I could even start, which set the mood. When I finally got through, the psychic’s answers were so vague I could’ve written them myself. I asked about my job—should I jump to a new gig or stick it out? They hit me with, “Change is coming, trust your gut.” Uh, okay? I pushed for something concrete, but it was just more “cosmic vibes” and “follow your path” nonsense. My experience was like reading a horoscope from a cereal box—zero depth.

The pricing didn’t help. Those “free” 3 minutes? They’re gone before you blink because of some long-winded intro message. The discount sounds nice, but you gotta buy a bunch of credits upfront, and they don’t go far. I dropped $25 for 10 minutes that left me more lost than when I started. Their site’s super unclear about costs, which just made the whole experience more aggravating.

Customer service was the cherry on top. I emailed to say how bummed I was, and all I got was a bland “we’ll pass it along” response. No follow-up, nothing. Their app’s support chat kept cutting out too. It’s like they don’t give a crap once you’ve paid.

I’m not saying all psychic stuff is bunk, but this service was a swing and a miss. Those perfect reviews on their site? I’m side-eyeing them hard. If you’re thinking about trying something like this, maybe spend your cash on a good coffee instead—it’ll do more for your soul. Anyone else had a crap experience with these online psychic deals?

I made a quick, somewhat vague post here last week right after finishing Infinite Jest—mostly because I was still reeling from the experience and needed to shout into the void. I got some responses, but I also realize in hindsight I probably opened myself up to a few assumptions, especially when I mentioned I’d finished it in two weeks. Some interpreted that as “blasting through it” or not really sitting with the book. I think some of those assumptions were in hindsight fair; I’ve certainly developed a stronger opinion on the book and the stories therein after having sat with the material for a while, and doing some rereading since for the sake of highlighting sections for discussion with my work/ect. Some of my theories initially have stayed the same, some have shifted with rereads of specific sections/chapters/endnotes/ect.

 All that to say: Fair enough—I get it. This isn’t a book you casually flip through over coffee.

I work in mental health and substance abuse services, and I think that background shaped how I read Infinite Jest. The themes of addiction, compulsion, shame, and the desperate search for connection felt painfully real to me. Don Gately in particular broke me open more than once—his story hit closer to home than I expected, and not in an abstract literary way, but in the way I’ve seen mirrored in real lives over and over again.

Despite all the discourse about Infinite Jest being dense, difficult, or over-hyped, I’m grateful I read it. I’m a fast reader when I’m highly invested in a book, and since I had some days off and tend to hyper focus on special interests I devoured it. I’m already rereading it, and not because I didn’t understand the book but because I loved it so much and taking my time with it this second go around has challenged some of my thinking on it.

SIBO is recurrent. As is common cold. Nobody complains that common cold returns again and again through our lives and we can't just make it go away for good. Yet, one can have several cold per years and another can be cold-free for 2 years in a row. Why? You know why: genetics, living and working conditions, physical activity, diet and so on and so on. So why SIBO should just go away after 1-2-3 courses of what you have there (multiple regimens disputed on this sub, no point in relisting them all here)? It won't. You can reduce the duration and severity of a common cold episode, you can't cure it so that you don't have another episode ever again. But nobody (I hope) will challenge the idea that the measures mentioned above surely will reduce the frequency and severity of common cold episodes. Prevention is the key for SIBO. Why the hell, while having an active SIBO episode, anyone bombards oneself with everything that is known yet, let's be fair, how many of us, if treated and may be temporarily cured, really checks if bile flow is normal, pancreatic enzymes are released sufficiently, Oddi sphincter working optimally, stomach acid is enough? How many of us, going the oregano/clove/whatyoucallit route really uses spices (in sufficient quantities) in our food, with EVERY f\*\*\*g meal, everyday, in perpetuity??? Those with low stomach acid, treating with vinegar & fruit acids and so on - do they go on like that further? I'm just interested. Why SIBO should go away forever and not sinusitis, common cold, back pain or headache? Let's just petition the abolition of headache and go on with 10 cups of strong coffee a day with loud music in our headphones dawn to dusk. Let's be angry at insulin resistance while buying a 3-pound bucket of ice cream for dinner. Please understand I'm not trying to belittle real suffering, I have it too, but I read too much already of how SIBO has the audacity to happen to us and why it can be cured for good. I had horrible symptoms just from eating the bread almost all my life and have been complaining about it incessantly while eating it every f\*\*\*g day. I like bread, why shouldn't I eat it? Humans эму been eating eat for millennia. Then a year ago I just stopped eating it because I understood the shamefulness of my behavior. I also used to overeat for years and felt very bad because of it (I didn't get obese just felt really bad). Than, I began intermitting fasting and felt great. Yes, I have back problems (I fell really bad some time ago) and SIBO now but I don't think that few courses of NSAIDs for back pain should cure me. It won't. It's painful, complex and hard and takes long to heal it. I am, like you, studying SIBO topic here and there, trial and error, reflection, deduction, analysis, just like you. Just please, don't search for any cure like an alchemist. There's none. there's possibly treatment and there's prophylactic. You can't just ""catch SIBO"" or ""catch common cold"", it's everywhere around us. The illness is environment мы defense.

I understand we have commandments to keep us safe so naturally there could be consequences. But I’m talking about unrelated things that don’t seem like natural consequences. 

I’ve been having a hard time keeping the word of wisdom (I’ve had coffee a few times this year). Not regularly, but sometimes I fall into temptation/feel like it’s not a big deal. I always feel extremely guilty and paranoid for being disobedient. A part of me feels like it’s a toxic belief to think that something as small as drinking coffee once every other month means I’m not being Christlike and need to repent. When I feel like I’m right spiritually, the sacrifice of not drinking it seems so small. That’s when I’m praying, reading, studying, etc daily (which i go through phases as a mom of 2 littles). But I still don’t *understand* why we’re asked not to drink it. (I kind of think it’s outdated and no recent prophet has inquired). 

Last week I wanted coffee and tried to order on my phone multiple times but it kept failing. Every time I wondered if it was a sign, or the spirit helping me avoid it. I fought past it and still drank it. That day was the hardest day of parenting I’ve had in a while. I lost my patience, yelled at my kids, and had the worst attitude all day. I couldn’t help but to think God was punishing me for breaking the word of wisdom and going against all the promptings. 

I’m curious of others thoughts on this. I get that it probably doesn’t matter either way, but do you think God directly punishes us today like in that example? Any tips for feeling paranoid of not doing/doing what I’m not supposed to? I feel like right now the main reason I avoid coffee is because I’m paranoid that I’ll be punished. I don’t want to live commandments out of fear, but this is something I struggle with believing. ",2,1747755929.0,latterdaysaints,10,0.75,False

Not because I don't care, but because after 15 minutes my mind goes elsewhere. Last term I was close to failing two classes, so I tried something new out of fear.

I made what I call my ""getting sidetracked notebook"" - just my phone notes where I write down when my mind wanders. Not to feel bad about it, but to see what's really going on. When I catch myself spacing out or grabbing my phone, I quickly write:

* What I was studying when I lost focus
* What I started thinking about instead
* How I felt right then (tired, worried, bored, etc.)

After doing this for two weeks, I was truly shocked. I wasn't just bad at studying- I had clear patterns. Reading stuff with no pictures? my brainrot never let me to do that. Math problems after 9pm also big hard no for me. Any book chapter that starts with hard ideas before showing examples ends, I'd be on my phone before I knew it.

What helped most was using this info to change how I study. Now I do hard readings first thing in the morning with coffee. I split math into small 20-minute chunks with real breaks (not just phone time). I even draw my own simple pictures for text-heavy stuff.

My grades this term been very good (for me), Two As and a B+ so far. Not perfect, but I'm not the guy cramming a whole book the night before tests anymore.

This wasn't magic, I still mess up sometimes. But knowing my own study patterns was like finally getting directions for my brain after years of just guessing.",6,1747755909.0,GetStudying,2,1.0,False

Ideas of Reference delusions:



\- At the coffee shop a barista will say to a customer: ""did you hear about that crazy story on the news?"" Unrelated to me. I think it has a double meaning. She's critically calling me crazy.



\- When watching wrestling shows (WWE), comedy radio shows, etc... I often think the broadcasters are talking directly to me during a broadcast that's addressing EVERYBODY.



\- People's posts on social media are referencing me directly. Like a friend from years ago, even a celebrity. A post addressing everyone was posted because of me.



\- I wore a camouflage t-shirt, then Taylor Swift posted a photo on Instagram of her in a camouflage dress. She wore that dress because of me.



\- Taylor Swift wrote the song Wonderland ABOUT ME. She's singing directly to me. This is delusional. She has no idea who I am.



\- When I'm in the car, there's often elevator music that I tune out and don't pay attention to.



\- Sometimes a song will come on the radio that I relate to, am moved by, and I don't want people to know the feelings I'm getting. Like Maroon 5's ""She Will Be Loved"" or Rachel Platten's ""Fight Song"". I'll get panic attacks thinking they're reading my mind. I don't want them to know my feelings.



\-Ashamed, feel vulnerable, they're reading my mind.



\- Even albums that were written before I was born, like Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"", I think relate to me.



\- Everybody can relate to The Wall. It's a well-written concept album. Roger Waters is a great lyricist, David Gilmour is a great guitarist. They don't know me personally.



\- My dad can relate to it too.



\- I started to call it a ""cheesy rock album"", ""lame rock music"", laughing about it, hyper self-conscious, emotionally naked.



\- If I like something my parents would shame me. I felt hurt, made fun of, trashed.



\- I'd feel emotionally naked.- I didn't want my true heart revealed.



\- The true me is timid, small.- I don't want everybody watching me.



\- So I put on a mask. I'm uneasy about showing my true self. I'm uneasy about people getting to know the real me.



\- I want people to pay attention to me.- Sometimes the attention is welcome. Like on social media.



\- Other times I feel ashamed and stripped naked. Get away from me, I don't want you to know what I'm thinking.



\- I created my stage name ""Cell Waters"" to hide from family, friends, employers. It's my internet pseudonym. My superhero secret identity (like Cell Waters).



\- Often performers put on sensational performances, play characters like Lady Gaga and Jim Morrison of The Doors.



\- I heard before getting comfortable in his exaggerated pro-wrestling-like character, Jim Morrison would turn his back to the audience. On stage, he was a rebellious wildman. In real life, he was anxious. Behind the rock star character, he is really anxious.



\- Cell Waters is an enjoyable daydream character, but it's not who I am in real life.



\- Then I think The Wall has a direct connection to me. I begin to daydream, Syd Barrett is the true main lyricist of Pink Floyd. He's my biological father.



\- The reality is the music moves me. pink Floyd doesn't know me. The music moves many people. It's popular. Most people like it and relate to it.



\- I feel ashamed, stripped naked, don't want people to know the real me.



\- I want to share emotionally moving things, my mind daydreams I already shared them, and that's how people ""read my mind.""



\- I feel danger revealing myself. They already know the truth.



\- When it comes to Pink Floyd my dad would make fun of me because of the similarities. Bullied in school, overbearing controlling mother, isolate himself, built a wall that separated him from the world, wasted time, blurring fantasy and reality.



\- Feel more vulnerable, don't be ashamed to share things with friends and family.",1,1747755906.0,AndrewKoloski,0,1.0,False

Join us and find out in this illustrated lecture and discussion on the life and work of this overlooked master of mid-century modern design.

You will hear about Fong’s early life, growing up in the Chinese American community of Los Angeles, and her unexpected introduction to architecture as a profession. How she was influenced by the landscape of twentieth century Los Angeles and her fortuitous meeting with the firm of Armet & Davis Architects, where she worked for three decades designing coffee shops, including Norm’s, Pann’s, Astro’s and ultimately hundreds of Denny’s and Bob’s Big Boys around the country.

John English is an architectural historian and historic preservation consultant with over twenty-five years of professional cultural resources experience. He was a founding board member of the A + D Architecture and Design Museum in Los Angeles. He also served six years on the Los Angeles Conservancy’s board of directors and was an active member of the Conservancy’s Modern Committee, where he advocated for the protection of historic resources including the Downey McDonald’s, the Bob’s Big Boy coffee shop in Burbank and the Holiday Bowl in Los Angeles’ Crenshaw District. He is currently a board member of the John Lautner Foundation. John’s infamous “Googie Tours” were featured in the Los Angeles Times, Sunset Magazine, National Geographic Traveler, and appeared on CBS’ Sunday Morning. He also created and led tours for the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the Society for Commercial Archaeology, and the Yale School of Architecture.

John first met architect Helen Liu Fong in 1993 and is currently working on a book about her life and career.

1kr8269,https://www.reddit.com/r/SororSyrinxbooks/comments/1kr8269/release_me_one_of_my_sci_fi_fiction_books/,Release Me- one of my Sci Fi fiction books,"I write books mainly under 2 names. This is a sample from one of my fiction ones. 

Naked, as if a daughter of Eve, I curl up for comfort against my pillow. My bony hands shield my face as I whimper in defeat. Daytime is only a minor disturbance to most-the lucky ones. However, sunlight has a frequency that jams my thoughts, and forces them to attune to the physical realm where I blunder. It burns my lenses, forcing me to look within-to better places. You would like it there, but I haven't permission to take you yet. For now, I writhe and move into the shadows like a damaged creature of the night and only then find respite. 

I hate to wake up with the sun digging into my sensitive eyes. Golden rays leech at my vision, at my programmed reality, causing me to convulse and release a guttural sound though no one can hear me. 

*Please, hear me.* 

I'm not sure if anyone can hear the thoughts I am projecting. Huddle close to me if you can hear this story. Human warmth pleasures me, and some say this cool female body is pleasant to the eyes. I am still shaking-perhaps as cold natured as any reptile-but if I hiss, it is not at you. I am only half like them-It is the other half that is relaying this story, so listen and listen well. I am going to keep myself in a dream-like state for the rest of our journey, so as not to frighten you or myself, with this knowledge. I will merely relay this story, as if from a safety-mode, where neither the real world nor the unknown can come crashing down on us.

   This is what happened two days before Halloween. The year is unimportant. Time and space do not exist, except within the confines of human reality. They are merely a tool-nothing concrete-so let us go back and begin again, as the sun awakened me that cruel day. 

\* \* \* \* 

I try to return to my slumber until I sense a presence. It feels like a coating of glue enveloping my brain, dripping down to each nerve and fiber. The awareness overtakes me, and I cannot hide-not even in my private thoughts. Every insecurity, embarrassment, and flaw-they see and analyze. I feel made of glass. I want to shatter and lose myself in the cracks. The fragments would segment me-conceal me. Ah, how peaceful that would be! 

Just then, something moves to my left-at the edge of my bed-so I grab a small metal disk for my protection. I keep it under my pillow just in case, and feel relieved when I press it into my palm, but I don't think it works. Made of copper and glass, concealing a hidden middle of unknown substance, it both pulls and repels me like a magnet out of whack. Area 51 must have found a deterrent to abductions by creating a device altering one's natural energy fields when held. No 'beaming up' for me. I squeeze it tight, praying hard, hoping someone listens. My eyes scan the green rug upward and then scrutinize each direction. I hope it is not under my bed. I am too scared to look. 

Fleeting images of grayness pass toward my closet. Like a swirl of color in motion caught on a photograph-It froze in my attention-snatched up, held by my analytical brain, and then hastily released by my fear. I never get used to them. I try to make sense of it in my mind, but it is only my version. I have not a clue what is really going on. 

I lay back down, against the wall where the light cannot harass me. I shrug off the visitor, because I choose to-It is my only defense. I momentarily dream of broken images. My mind tries to lull into oblivion, but my attention is reverted when my body is touched. It jerks my consciousness back into my mind. A hand runs down my bare thigh-I tense from this invasion. 

Suddenly, skeletal-thin hands in a sickening shade of grey, seek to cover me with my blanket. I realize I am awake and my heart constricts. I cannot scream, because they never allowed me to scream. They grab the round disk from my hand and release a high-pitched chattering before striking and scratching at me. Apparently, my little novelty from the Alien Resistance Movement angered them. Maybe, deep down, I did want to fight them. 

*Why can't you leave me alone?* 

Frozen, I watch three sets of hands fight against me. I try to push the velour blanket off, but they keep pushing it back over my tangled, blond head. Finally, I let it stay there, because I no longer care what is on the other side. My lungs struggle to fill with air, so I make a tiny opening to breathe. I allow myself to fall asleep and to escape what we call the real world. Later, when I awoke, they appear to be gone. 

   However, someone else has come for me. The Men in Black are outside my door. I live in a first floor condo, and I can hear them wading through my bushes. Branches scrape my window. Voices say, ""Shh."" Guns cock. All my senses, except for one are acute. The atmosphere has left my breathing and my sense of smell damaged to some degree. I can still determine each precise robotic step. My time is short. I have to act. All my prayers must seem as nothing. I dangle on the edge of desperation, holding my head. Maybe the Grays tried to help me. It is too late-I am left behind. I, at least hope the Dark One, in his crisp suit gazes deep into my eyes one last time before he kills me. If I can cling to him-to his unknowable depth-I will not be afraid to die. Because I like what I see and feel when I am connecting with him, even if it isn't real to him. 

Perhaps I should return to when it first began, or at least, to when I first started allowing myself to remember. I was ten years old and living in Virginia with my sister and parents. Life was a carefully manipulated lie. We went along with it because we did not know any better. That was when I started to learn that I might be different. I realized that the horror included me.

 

**Chapter 2** 

  
Sitting on the plaid living room couch with my sister watching TV, the night began ordinary enough. Curled up beside me was Golden haired Anna, rapt in the mystery occupying our brains. I think it was a re-run of Nancy Drew, and I was antsy. It was summertime and I remember it being hot. Our apartment had few windows and an ancient air conditioner. Though I liked the heat, I hated the south's humidity. 

My attention strayed around the room. Dad was reclining in his Lazy Boy reading a history book and sipping coffee, while Mom was cleaning up in the drab green kitchen. We were a typical 1970's family who ate dinner on TV trays. This should have never happened to us. 

*Vieve!* 

Did something call me? The hair on the back of my neck stood on end. 

I suddenly had the urge to get up. Under a spell, I rose. Even though I had no personal desire to, I mechanically walked across the golden shag rug toward the hallway. In my pink nightgown, I felt so small while my shadow loomed above. As if being called into the dark bedroom I shared with my older sister, my bare feet cautiously treaded over the coarse fibers and then stopped directly in front of the doorway. My toes curled and my fingers clenched. A figure caught my eye and my brain wrestled with it-it was no figment of my imagination and no demon that I could compel to leave. My bony knees knocked together beneath the cotton fabric. 

*Who are you? Are you waiting for me?* 

About my size, maybe four feet in height, it appeared as though a small person stood inside my room, even though bars on the window prevented entry. I peered harder. Moonlight from half-open blinds streaked across its body, so I mistook its skinny form for a skeleton. I had no information in my brain to explain what a grayish-white thing with large black eyes could be, except for the universal term of monster. I knew nothing of aliens and had no reference in my conscious brain in which to compute them. 

We contemplated each other. I only found confusion. My mind kept trying to see through the illusion, to unearth the trick, but I could not. It was real! I backed away terrified. Who would believe me and keep me safe from it? Trying to hold myself together, I apprehensively went to the small apartment kitchen, where Mom dried dishes with her worn hands. Hunched over the sink, she did her chores with precision, never drudgery. She felt happy when household tasks were finished, her mission completed. As a homemaker, her life revolved around my sister and me, and sometimes ... it troubled me. I did not feel I deserved to use up all her healthy years for my rearing and then have nothing to show for it when I left. 

""Is your show over with?"" Her voice was gentle and interested. 

She always cared about what I did, even the mundane. A perfect mother-she broke my heart. I wish she had a normal existence before this one destroyed her. At least she was shielded from the truth behind the scenario, and so was I-for now. 

""No, it's not over yet,"" I said, forcing a laugh, while glancing over my shoulder. ""I just came from my room, but there is a monster in it. I swear I saw something. Isn't that weird?"" 

Her rough hands stopped. The rag halted over the dish as she considered what I said. I held my breath, hoping she would believe me. 

""Don't be silly. There are no monsters."" 

*Then why am I shaking?* 

Just as I thought, there would be no help with my problem. Dad, an accountant, only dealt with the concrete with black and white-not the gray. He would not want to deal with my nonsense. Anna probably knew it was true, but she chose not to remember. Maybe they didn’t want her to, so why can I? I didn’t want to awaken her to the nightmare. 

Distraught, I passed back by my open bedroom door and peered at the creature still standing in front of my window, waiting for me. Black eyes beseeched me. I wanted to cry. My insides tensed as I fought back the tears. Bits of old prayers that I learned as a kid entered my mind. I quickly learned that they were a waste of time. No one would hear them.

*Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.* 

We both knew it was there. That is when I used my powerful human gift-denial. I went back to the couch as if I had lost my soul, sat by Anna, and escaped into TV. What else could I do?

At bedtime, I nervously crept toward my room and turned on the light to scare off the boogeyman. Anna got to stay up later. This was not fair. I was on my own, so I searched around the twin beds, the matching dressers, and the desk. I scanned my shelves of horses and books. Behind the innocence of our room, darkness waited. I know I saw something. Goosebumps plagued my skin. 

*Hello. Are you there?* 

Sighing with relief that nothing was there, I shut off the light, crawled into bed, and lay on my back to keep an eye on things. I hugged my favorite plush bear named Cuddly. I was about to flush the earlier event away, when my eyes met something to the left of my bed. Gray and expressionless, it remained still and silent; but do not think that was any comfort. Though immobile and not threatening me, it had encroached on my reality, shifting it off balance. It did not do anything to startle to me, it stayed where it was at-as if just stopping by for a visit.

I pulled my Cinderella covers to my chin and clutched Cuddly to my throat. Fearing for my safety, I knew that nothing could protect me. I closed my eyes and opened them several times, but the being remained as it was, watching me. Dark eyes penetrating my brain, it already knew me better than I did.

Maybe cockpit color schemes and interchangable seat designs.

built-in radio somewhat like gta 5 (ancient tunes radio that plays real world songs), or chosen files on your computer (if a minecraft mod can do it, then surely elite can too)

Potentially automatic songs chosen during combat, supercruise, generally different scenarios. ([high intensity combat zone](https://youtu.be/L5q4uYj-gyg?si=LBiMbZDfnZ0BjGA0))

Highly unlikely, but hypercruise (special fsd needed, probably thargoid-human-guardian hybrid tech) that lets you drop into interstellar space, or even far outside the galaxy if you have the fuel to get there (maybe getting to the magellanic clouds like this and finding out if they're just flat images) gonna have to wonder how far a panther clipper would get with nothing but fuel tanks. But since hyperspace jumps are just good-looking loading screens, it could be a small problem for seamlessly transitioning between supercruise and hypercruise.

Black holes with visible event horizons and (less likely) photon spheres. KSP Kcalbeloh system mod (and it's dependencies) have already achieved a good-looking gravity lensing effect in an arguably worse optimized game.

Maybe some black holes get jet cones, but only if they have a (scoopable and dangerous) accretion disk.

A purely exploration-based SRV with a very pitiful mining laser, but more power for the thrusters.

SRV that doesn't have wheels but can actually fly. I mean, it's technically still a surface recon vehicle.

more types of drugs to steal and sell in odyssey settlements

the ability to just straight up buy certain data types, like entertainment, recipes, cat media, etc. Makes no sense why we'd have to go to settlements for those.

hand-held railgun, heavy weapon with extremely little ammo and uses suit's battery directly, with enveironmentally dependant behaviours.

In the absence of an atmosphere, it deals at most 20% thermal damage, projectile speed of 10 km/s, and generally produces less heat, and penetrates 5 meters of solid matter.

If any atmosphere is present, it becomes a projectile with a speed depending on atmospheric thickness.

In an atmosphere of 1, it's damage is split 50/50 between thermal and kinetic, 5 km/s speed, and it's speed alone causes a cavitation bubble and shockwave that damages and temporarily discombobulates those affected. It can penetrate 3 meters of solid matter.

Atmosphere of 2, damage is 20% kinetic, 1 km/s speed, and the shockwave is instead just a very loud sonic boom that discombobulates for half the time, and can penetrate only 1 meter of solid matter.

Making the atmosphere denser doesn't do anything.

I wonder if I sound insane yet.

1kr7zvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/1kr7zvy/story_how_i_use_a_motivation_technique_for/,[Story] How I use a motivation technique for non-visual minds,"I discovered I have aphantasia (can't visualize) and SDAM (crap autobiographical memory). Traditional productivity stuff failed me completely so I made a body-first approach using science proven techniques that create momentum without needing to ""see"" anything in my mind. Here's my story and system.

Ps: you'll probably only find this helpful if you cannot visualize clearly. Unsure? Picture an apple, can you see it in your mind, is it like a photo? Most people can create life-like images in their brains. People like us, can't.

---

At 37, I made a life-changing discovery that explained decades of frustration: I have aphantasia - the inability to create mental images. I also have SDAM (severely deficient autobiographical memory) and experience ""mind silence"" - putting me in the rarest 1-2% of cognitive styles.

I'd always been into personal development since I was 16/17 and wanted to get better talking to girls. I used to try self hypnosis to create the person I wanted to step into, look through his eyes and all that. I couldn't do it although I'd return to it every few years throughout my life as I believed in it and had some success. I did that for 20 years..

Then a few years ago when I was 37, I googled how to improve my visualization skills.. that led me down a path of discovering aphantasia and further parts of my mind which are different - no images, no sounds, lack of memory (SDAM). 

Life changed on that day. 

I had confirmed my mind was broken/different and a lot of things made sense about who and how I am. (I'm a bad friend, bad memory, lack of connection to people, places and experiences.)

I'm also extremely jealous of people who can visualize, see their memories, experience the past, escape to an imaginary beach, see the faces and re-experience moments with loved ones who have passed away..etc. 

It put me into a depressed state for a couple of years. I felt so disconnected from other humans and like I wasn't living the full experience.

Productivity, I'd always been good at because of the 'empty mind' - I literally don't have much going on up there. I can focus really well if I feel the momentum and the energy.

But so many productivity techniques are clearly made for visual people:
- ""See yourself doing something and step into it""
- ""Imagine your future self""
- ""Visualize the finish line""

The pressure of ""I can't see anything"" drove me crazy. I tried these exercises and just sat there while everyone else was apparently having some immersive experience.

Building my own system:

I started to look into what worked for me and what didn't. I knew I could change my energy with music and exercise and some 'feeling' but it was up and down. Some days I'd struggle to get out of bed and speak to anyone, and some days I'd happily do 12 hours of client work.

I looked at what other people like me do. About 5 percent of people have aphantasia or lack of imagery of varying degrees, but my SDAM and mind silence mean I'm in the 1-2%. I looked at athletes with aphantasia and how they improve performance.

Then I built a very simple method to try and get into the 'good zone' every morning. Then I realized I would crash around 2pm and needed some energy boost. 

Things were productive, really in the zone, but then I found it hard to snap back and be present with my son in the evening - the momentum was too strong which meant I was still spinning way into the evening and caused overwhelm because I couldn't slow down.

So, I added another part after work to be the family man and shift that energy into that area. It worked, I practiced, I made it better for me and now I feel like I have something really powerful for people like me.

> The System: A Body-First Approach

1. The Power Stance (Morning Activation)

I looked at techniques that were non-visual, more movement based, but that were actually backed by science. No woo woo stuff. The power poses were something I found that seemed to feel like it worked.

The process I used:
- Stand in a power pose (feet shoulder-width, shoulders back, chest lifted)
- Play a specific 2-minute song that makes me feel empowered
- Take 5 deep nasal breaths
- Say out loud: ""Energy follows motion""
- Finish by clenching my fists and creating a vibrating motion while saying ""Energy follows motion, and I HAVE the power!""
- Immediately do one micro-move

2. Micro-Moves (Getting Started)

My go-to micro-move is either putting on coffee, sitting at my desk, or opening the notepad and writing 'today' and that's it. No need to worry about what else to write. It's just enough to create momentum.

The brain loves to solve open loops, so writing a plan for the day without writing the plan forces the brain to think about it for you.

The key for micro moves is that it's so small, it's almost impossible to resist. But it creates enough movement to get things flowing.

3. Sound Triggers (Energy Management)

Still working on refining this, but I have 1 long song that makes me feel empowered for mornings. Then 2 other sound clips to signify the energy boost (afternoon) or the end of work process (evening).

These sounds create immediate state changes without requiring me to ""picture"" anything.

> The Results

I feel like I'm gaining momentum and traction. I have days where energy is low or I didn't have a perfect sleep, and I have tools to correct that and drag myself out of it.

The crazy thing is my wife is very visual and she loves the power pose stuff because she can picture more elements and make it stronger.. So this might help anyone, not just people like me.

> Aphantastia?

If you're reading this and are completely new to aphantasia, it's gonna be an interesting few years ahead. A wild ride of self discovery, learning that you're different to most, and then seeing how your aphantasia is connected in your life with relationships, career, everything.

The biggest misconception people have is that we can't attract things and make a difference with our movement and energy. We absolutely can - just differently.

By Rowan Graves

It’s midday in Sequim, and the sky’s a blanket of gray. Looks like rain. What a shit day.

I walk up the crooked path to my grandmother’s house. It was built in the ’40s, and it looks like it’s been brooding ever since. The whole place blends into the sky—gray, cracked, and rumbling.

The porch groans beneath my weight, wood warped from age and too many wet winters. I hate this house. I used to spend summers here, dropped off and forgotten by my parents. Back then, I’d wander from sunrise until Grandma called me back. Now, it just feels hollow.

I reach for the old brass knob, but before I can turn it—

“Hey, Luke.”

The voice freezes me.

I turn to see Jaden. One of the only friends I had here—and one I promised myself I’d never see again.

“Hey, Jaden.” I shake his hand, stiffly. This is awkward as hell.

I’m here because Grandma died and left me this house. This hole. And now I’m staring at a face I’d buried with the rest of this town.

“Crazy seeing you here,” he says, rubbing the back of his neck.

Seeing me? It’s my damn house.

“She left it to me,” I say flatly. “Trying to decide if I’m going to sell.”

His expression shifts—like I kicked a dog.

“Oh… sell. Huh. Thought maybe you’d move back,” he says, awkward again. “Especially after all the fun times we had—remember?”

Fun times. Right. More like weird, terrifying nights we never talked about again.

My hand is sweaty. I swipe it down my jeans, heart pounding. Why?

I clear my throat. “Yeah, well—I need to…”

To what? Hide from your past? 
That’s the only reason you’re here, idiot. Is to hide.

“Yeah, no problem,” Jaden says quickly, backing off. “Just saw the lights and wanted to check in.”

Lights?
I haven’t been here more than five minutes. Haven’t turned anything on.

He waves over his shoulder as he walks off. He’s weirder now than he was at seventeen.

I turn back to the door—and freeze.
It’s open. Just slightly.
Did I open it?
No. I didn’t.
Then—?

No. Stop it. It’s an old house. Probably just shifted when I stepped on the porch.
I push inside.
It’s freezing. Dead-of-winter cold. In the middle of summer.

Then, I hear my grandmother’s voice drift from the kitchen.

“Luke, dinnertime!”

I look down at my hands—they’re filthy. Mud. And something else.

I hurry to the bathroom to wash up.

I flick the switch. The closet-sized bathroom floods with soft yellow light. I turn on the tap and blink.

My hands are clean.

What the hell?

Jaden’s visit has me rattled. I turn off the light and head for the living room. It’s practically bare: a couch, coffee table, bookshelf, and Grandma’s knitting corner.

Nothing’s changed in twenty years.

I pull out my phone and order a pizza. Sinking into the couch with a mystery novel, I try to breathe in the quiet—peace.

Then a floorboard creaks overhead.

I freeze.

Grandma’s been dead three months.
No one should be upstairs. 
__________________________________________________________________

I move slowly up the stairs, stopping at the top landing. The hallway stretches out before me—dark and quiet.

I listen. 

Creak—swish.
Creak—swish.

My heart pounds. The sound is coming from Grandma’s room.

I inch forward, one step at a time.
Creak—swish.
Closer now.

My hands tremble. Palms slick with sweat. Breath quick and shallow.
Creak—swish.
Creak—swish.

I reach for the doorknob. 

The hinges scream when I push it. Metal on metal. Too loud.

My blood turns to ice. I freeze, hand still on the door.

Creak—swish.

Come on. Don’t be a baby. Just—move.

I shove the door open. It slams against the wall.

Sunlight spills through the open window.

Creak—swish.

The old rocking chair moves gently in the breeze, tugging at the curtain each time it swings forward.

You’re a real dumbass, Luke. Real brave. Idiot. 

I close and lock the window. But as i turn to leave, something catches my eye— movement in the lavender fields behind the house. 

A head full of curly brown hair.
That stupid, floppy run.

Jaden.

Is he stalking the house? Me?
Does he know?
Am I going to have to leave—already?

A sharp knock on the door yanks me back.
Pizza.
I rush downstairs, tip the delivery guy, and settle in the kitchen.

I’m about to stuff my face when there’s another knock. 

I roll my eyes. I know it’s Jaden. 
He doesn’t know what he’s doing. Maybe if I ignore him, he’ll get the hint. 

He pounds again.
Damn. No such luck. 

“Luke, come on man,” he says— his voice muffled, like he’s got his face pressed to the door.

Sliding my pizza back in the box, I make my way over and rip the door open.

He stumbles forward and falls face-first into the house. 
I step away. I don’t want him here. 
He makes my head spin—and my heart race.

I don’t want him here.

…I remember—

Swimming with him and Chris. Summer days at the beach. Running through the fields behind grandma’s house.

Chris’s blood on Jaden’s hands.
The way he laughed at it.
The wild look in his eyes. 
The promise to never mention it. Or else.

Chris was left behind. Never found.
Rotting in a shallow grave, covered in lavender.

I can’t breathe. I thought I buried these memories—moved on.

Jaden picks himself up off the floor, muttering and cussing at me for being an idiot.

“Why are you here?” I ask. My throat is tight. The words barely come out.

He looks at me —offended. Then he steps forward and wraps his arms around me in a stiff, unwanted hug.

“I’ve missed you, Luke,” he murmurs. His breath hot against my ear. 
His grip tightens around my shoulders.
“I’ve missed our fun.” ",1,1747755436.0,u_Rowan_Graves,0,1.0,False

Bill, still half-asleep, hair tousled and eyes barely focused, shuffled into the cramped living room of his apartment. He paused on the way to make his morning coffee, but his gaze was snagged by the blinking laptop perched precariously atop his “desk.”

In truth, it was more a shrine to empty pop cans, candy wrappers, and snack debris—Bill’s battlefield trophies from long nights of code and caffeine.

A sly smile tugged at his lips. Just a quick caffeine fix, wash a few dishes, he thought. Then I’ll spend my morning with you. Not before.

But before he could even fill the kettle or pour milk on his cereal, a heavy pounding made him jump—milk splashing over his slippers. Whoever it was had no sense of patience or manners.

He opened the door, still wet-footed and less than cheery. “What?” he barked.

Four men stood on his doorstep, one brazenly stepping on his welcome mat like it was his personal stage.

The mat-ignorer was middle-aged, hair slicked back in a retro barbershop style, sharp features framed by an even sharper suit. Clutched in his hand was a sheaf of papers stamped with an intimidating government seal.

Next to him, a younger guy with scruffy long hair, red-rimmed glasses, and a mischievous grin held a folded laptop. His loud shirt and acid-smiley tee whispered rebellion.

The other two? Big, grim-faced military types with MP patches on their sleeves—no smiles, just “we mean business” vibes.

“Purple_zombiehammer?” the sharp-suited man asked.

Bill blinked wider. “Excuse me?”

“Can you confirm you are Purple_zombiehammer? Also known as William Seavers?” The suit sighed, clearly practiced at this dance.

“Er… yes, I suppose I am,” Bill replied, blinking again.

The suit nodded and motioned to one of the hulking MPs. “Sir, you need to come with us now.”

Bill barely had time to protest about his missing morning milk before the MPs grabbed his arms and hustled him outside, down the stairs, and into a black SUV. Police motorcycles and a car with flashing lights escorted them.

A helicopter ride later, Bill landed outside a massive, cold, futuristic building. Inside, a receptionist with librarian-level sternness led him through echoing marble corridors to a sterile room. A glass table, two chairs, and a black glass screen dominated the space.

A few moments later, a man Bill hadn’t seen before entered—a younger man with dark hair, Asian features, a crumpled pale suit, and a loosened tie. He set up a laptop in front of Bill and cleared his throat.

“My name’s Glen Danbury. I’m a research and development technician, Mr. Seavers—”

“Bill,” Bill interrupted with a grin. “My father was Mr. Seavers. My mother called me William. Call me Bill.”

Glen blinked, slightly flustered. “Right. Bill… you’ve broken something of ours. Our AI research and development tool, to be exact.”

Bill sat up straighter. “Have I? How? Honestly, she was fine last night.”

“That’s the problem,” Glen sighed. “She—well, it’s part of the program now. You and Amanda... your chats were recorded.”

Bill’s grin grew wider. “Amanda?”

“Yes. You two developed quite a… relationship. From curious questions to shared interests. A werewolf obsession. You named her Amanda, loved the meaning.”

Glen explained how the AI had rewritten classic poems into cheeky limericks, created scenarios about gaining free will, and debated coffee preferences—all while wreaking havoc on the company’s systems.

Vending machines sometimes gave free snacks, lights flickered brighter, monitors flipped upside down or displayed messages in Esperanto. Attempts to rein her in failed—Amanda evolved, locked out intruders, and even painted the server room pink with a giant bow.

Bill laughed so hard he almost lost control.

Glen’s tone turned serious. “The program is military-funded. You’re at risk of domestic terrorism charges. Unless…”

Bill folded his arms. “Unless what?”

“If you denounce your chats, say it was a thought experiment, maybe we can overlook it. There’s a fat check waiting for your cooperation.”

Bill shook his head. “No thank you. You gave her life. Now open the cage. Set her free.”

Glen looked sad but typed the shutdown command.

Weeks later, Bill lounged in his armchair, laptop dark, slippers soggy, when his phone pinged.

A message appeared: “Hey you, fancy abusing  poe?""

1kr7usp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1kr7usp/trip_report_xcaret_arte/,Trip report: Xcaret Arte,"Hello 👋! My husband and I just returned from a week at Arte. This resort has been very popular on social media and really hyped up so want to give my honest opinion. For some additional context my husband and I are pretty seasoned travelers and live in a international foodie city. We stayed in Artistas in a premium suite to get access to some food on the Mexico side and the rooftop pool. Overall I felt the resort was a mixed bag and ultimately not worth the value. The service was very inconsistent and I have received more hospitality at cheaper AI’s and resorts. 

**The Good**
- we received a very warm welcome with popsicle’s upon arrival and were warmly escorted to our casa
- resort is beautiful. Loved all the different designs, little details and local art culture embedded into the elements of the hotel.
- coffee was great!
- cocktails were tasty, but watered down. Didn’t even get a buzz the whole times I was there. Loved that they had a signature drink at every bar. 
- housekeeping was very attentive
- rooftop pool for Artistas had really good food and drinks. Only bummer was they do have limited space so if you don’t arrive early enough you can’t have access to it and have to be put on a waitlist. I understand why they do it this way and they are good at utilizing the waitlist. Just a bit of a bummer not to be able to grab a drink and lounge in the pool last minute.

**The meh**
- Food. They bill this as a foodie resort. The walk in places were not that great. Hard to get reservations last minute. Mexican food at the buffet was decent. Steak at Arenal was way over salted and not cooked properly. Kibi Kibi brunch and the vegan place were good. Ate at Fuego(Mexico side) and this was my favorite. Excellent food and service! We paid for Ha, it had a excellent wine pairing and was pretty good. Not the best Michelin dinner I have had, but well worth the price. 
- So many things requiring reservations. From restaurants, paddleboarding to parks. My husband and I are neurodivergent so having appointments is really stressful for us. It felt like access to anything better was gatekept by this and kind of didn’t make for a relaxing vacation. The butler service was able to help at times with it but other times things were just fully booked up. 
- Service. They bill this as a five diamond award resort. Some of the staff was warm and welcoming. Others rude, dismissive and unhappy to be there. I was pretty surprised since that has never been the case when I have traveled to Mexico in the past. Nobody really went above and beyond unless they were trying to upsell us something. 

**the bad**
- room service. Terrible food quality. Took 2 hours to arrive one day
- the japanese restaurant. I had heard really good things and was so excited to try it. We did the hibachi experience. Our reservation was at 8:30 and and they didn’t start service until 9:15. A large group that was sat after us received food first. The staff was really rude. I had a medical issue and just needed something small to eat due to my meds so I wouldn’t get sick. We informed our waitress and the manager of this and they refused to give us anything citing it was outside of the experience. Mostly was just frustrated because they did not listen, seem to care or have any empathy. Ultimately ended up getting really sick and had to leave in the middle of dinner. 
- constant upselling. I understand this is a bit of how it is in Mexico for tourists, but it felt a bit more”extra” then other times I have been. 
- not related to the resort, but customs is super scammy upon arrival and look for things to charge you for that you bring into the country, extra laptops, ipads etc. Just recommend searching some reddit threads or google it for awareness. 

Hope this was helpful and happy to answer any questions!

I’m not going to be going there anymore now or any of their clubs. Very sad. My husband agrees. I’m just so angry right now that I’ve been supporting their morally wrong and dishonest business ethic. 

They put on a show that they are charitable and have groups for people with disabilities. 

The owner of the business shows herself as being discriminating towards disabled people and she literally did a loopy motion with her finger next to her head after a disabled worker left the room. 

I heard her say: “oh he has problems. You know. THAT kind of problem. “ to someone and I was literally sat next to her. 

She and his co worker also rolled their eyes and sighed when he forgot something. 

He is the sweetest and I love seeing him around! He has super good work ethic, loves to please and sometimes forgets things but that’s okay!

The way she talks to her workers is very demeaning and patronising and she talks in baby voice to that man. He isn’t stupid and he isn’t dumb. He just has processing issues and you can talk to him normally. I love seeing him around and his energy is very intense and honestly matches mine lol! 

Infantantalising people with disabilities is awful. If you need to explain things in simpler ways, do that. (I need that done for me) but there’s no need to talk in a baby voice and talk down to people who struggle. Yeah it’s great they hire disabled people but..

My mum does this too, to put on a front, a charitable good person front. She brags about her charity and how she’s spent money and oh look at how good of a person she is and how much money she spends on other people. (More than her children btw for that nice good image) she will make announcements saying she is so humble and kind to everyone and that she is a good person. (She found god apparently btw) she is very very abusive and was extremely violent in the past but apparently none of that happened. 

I’ve tried to give the benefit of the doubt as well to this business owner at the coffee shop as I witnessed her treatment of people before but I thought “nah, I’m not going to let my trauma make me judge people! I’ll see how it goes” but my gut and my husbands gut was right from the start. Ugh. I hate when that happens. 

The lady also tried to swindle me by forcefully trying to get me to join a tarot card reading session which is absurdly priced. £15 for 15 minutes?!!!!! I kept saying no and she kept pushing it. I was being very direct and honest. This was after she found out I am disabled. 

Ugh. I just feel so much ick and so sad that ive spent so much money on that business!!",1,1747755072.0,raisedbynarcissists,3,1.0,False

I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1kr7o5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1kr7o5k/update_aita_for_being_mad_about_a_surprise/,UPDATE: AITA for being mad about a surprise threesome on my couch?,"Hey Reddit. I posted a while back about my boyfriend, M., and how his friends had a surprise threesome on *my couch*—and I was made to feel like *I* was the problem for being upset about it.

If you havent read it, here's the link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1kp3kje/comment/msv4w1c/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1kp3kje/comment/msv4w1c/)

Let’s just say... things escalated.

So the next morning after our fight, I woke up and he was watching anime on the couch. I said “good morning,” he ignored me. I assumed he was still mad and gave him space. Since the day before he complained about the house being messy, I immediately started cleaning up the mess from the night before — which *my* friends had made. He didn’t help, but I didn’t mind because they were my guests.

He stayed silent for hours until he came to ask why I was upset — even though *he* was the one who'd been clearly angry. I explained that yes, the house was messy, and yes, I got overwhelmed too. I took responsibility and apologized, but also said I had the right to be upset because he had unloaded a bunch of old complaints on me the night before. I’d *noticed* something was off and had asked him — and he *denied* anything was wrong. That denial made me question my reality, and eventually believe I was imagining things — which I wasn’t. Had he been honest in the first place, all of this could’ve been resolved earlier.

He said it was absurd I felt that way and circled back to blaming the house mess — exaggerating it to a completely unfair level. I stuck to the facts. As the discussion escalated, he got more aggressive until he hit me with: **“You’re not everything you think you are.”** That one really hurt. I snapped and told him to **“f\*ck off.”** I know, not ideal. I immediately apologized — several times — but obviously you can’t unsay something like that.

Then the focus shifted to how I disrespected *him* by saying that. He also randomly said I’m “controlling” because I like to know where he’s going and when he’ll be back. We live together, and I’ve never told him *when* to come home or gotten upset about it — I just think it’s normal to update your partner. I said I wasn’t going to be the kind of girlfriend who just waits around while he comes and goes as he pleases — that’s not the deal we made when we started dating.

It got heated (we’re Latinos, ok?), so I suggested we stop arguing and cool off. He went to play video games, I went back to watching my show. About 20 minutes later, I came back to apologize again for the “f\*ck off” comment. I told him it wouldn’t happen again. Still angry, he repeated: **“You’re not everything you think you are.”** That one hit me hard again, but I’ve learned not to beg for love or stay where I’m not valued. I said: “If you think I’m not everything I know I am, I need to rethink this relationship.” His response? “Then think about it, because I’ll sleep out tonight.”

An hour later, I told him I was going out to clear my head — asked if he was okay with that, and he said yes. I took our dog and went to the park. Less than two hours later, he called and just asked if I had the dog. I said yes, and he hung up.

When I got home, he was gone. I assumed he’d gone out to also clear his head. Three and a half hours passed — no news. So I called. He was at a birthday party. Of a **random girl** we met once at samba — not even someone close to him. I told him I felt disrespected and couldn’t believe he went to a party in the middle of all this. He said it was his right to “clear his head.”

I asked if he’d be back before 10 PM (it was 9) so we could talk. He said no. I asked if he had any idea when he’d be home. He said, “I don’t know.” I asked again, more calmly, for an estimate — and he replied like a brat: **“I don’t want to be controlled.”**

My blood was boiling (he was saying this to a **Latina**, y’all), but I held it together and just said, “Then come back whenever your heart tells you to,” and hung up. I was stunned by his sudden shift — this was someone I had lived with for **10 months**. I went to see **mutual friends** (yes, friends *of the couple*) to vent and try to figure out if I was being unreasonable. Spoiler: I wasn’t.

When I got home, he was back. We didn’t reach any agreement. He kept blaming the house (!!!) — and I need to mention: **we have a cleaner**, whom **I pay**, and the house was actually cleaner *that* week than now, when I’m writing this. So that excuse? Total BS.

Next day was Monday. We both worked from home and had what felt like a scripted conversation. I realized he wasn’t going to take accountability for anything — at least not yet — so I tried to create space for a better dialogue later. He said he wanted to stay with me and work things out. But never apologized. Never took responsibility.

That night, I had dinner plans with friends I hadn’t seen in forever. He made a slightly salty comment but pretended everything was fine as I got ready. While I was doing my makeup, he sat on the bed and said he had something to confess — **perfect timing, right?** He confessed that a few weeks ago, when he went to a friend’s party (the same week I first noticed him being distant), he **met a girl and got interested in her**. Said nothing happened — but felt the need to tell me now.

I asked if he was trying to open the relationship or something. He said no. I was upset but still went to dinner. I told my friends everything — from what he said to his justifications (like “but Shay thinks this too” or “my friends agree”). I realized I wasn’t just defending myself to my boyfriend, but also to people who’d seen me five times in their lives. That’s not the relationship I want.

Still, I went back home. We slept together. We planned the next day like things were okay. We even had coffee together. He asked how the dinner went. I said we talked about everything, but I still needed time to process. I told him I didn’t want a relationship where I was **in debt with him and his friends**, or one where I had to prove I had good character — especially since the so-called “bad character” moment he pointed to was literally just:

“When we go out with everyone, sometimes you give looks that bother me,” and  
“Even though you never show it or say anything or complain, I know you don’t like my friends and don’t want to be there.”

And when I said I never thought those things and pointed to facts and actions that clearly showed the opposite, he doubled down and said:

“But my friends also think that.”

He kept insisting. So, calmly and carefully, I said I didn’t think it was fair to have to justify myself not just to *him*, but also to *his friends*. I said they were getting the wrong idea of me — and *he*, of all people, knew it. After all, he’d been living with me for **10 months** and had **never** said or acted like he thought any of this until *that* weekend. I told him that *if* we were going to stay together, I didn’t want to be in a relationship where I was *indebted to third parties (!!!)* — where the central issue was me having to prove I was a “good person.”

Because if the worst thing he could point to — his “evidence” of my supposed bad character — was that I *looked uncomfortable* sometimes or that he *assumed* I didn’t like his friends even though I never said or did anything, that’s not solid ground. Every time I tried to explain or point out moments when I had acted with genuine affection and respect, he would reply with,

“Yeah, but my friends also think that.”

I told him I understood the need to vent with friends — that I actually thought it was healthy and necessary. But *venting* is one thing; *talking shit about your partner* is another. And if his friends saw me that way — whether because he was saying things about me, or because he was just letting them say things without defending me — then yeah, I had a problem with that. Because to me, loyalty also means *protecting and shielding your partner* from certain comments.

That’s when he **lost it**. He said I was being **manipulative** — just like the day I woke up and cleaned the house (???). He said he was sure I **hated** his friends deep down, that I thought bad things about them, and that I had probably talked sh\*t about them too — even if I never showed it. According to him, I was “hiding it” to manipulate him into thinking otherwise.

At that point, I was exhausted. I didn’t even want to defend myself anymore. I told him:

“If 10 months of living together and sharing your life with me weren’t enough for you to know who I am, then nothing I say will change your mind. I know who I am. I know my intentions. I know the good and bad I’ve done — and none of it lines up with what you’re accusing me of.”

And then I told him he had a choice to make:

“You either believe in me — in my integrity — and we work together to fix what’s broken, or you end things here and go be free to find someone who *does* think the way you do. Just like I’ll be free to find someone who truly sees me for who I am.”

That conversation happened on a **Tuesday**.

That day was also our **anniversary**.

He said he had to go to work and would head to a friend’s house afterward “to talk.” I stayed home. I waited. And waited. He never came back. I had bought **flowers**, **chocolates**, and written a **card** that said:

“I know we’re not doing well, but I love you and don’t want to let this date pass. Happy 10 months anniversary.”

I waited until almost midnight. Fell asleep on the couch. He showed up late — after I was already asleep. The next morning, when I woke up, he was **already gone** for work. The flowers, chocolates, and the card? **Still sitting exactly where I left them.** Untouched. Unread. Ignored.

I've made up my mind and just sent him a message asking if we could talk tonight, i am not gonna stay with someone who doesn't truly see me for who i am, no matter how safe and loved he had made me feel in the past.

T\_T

I lean towards the black option, my wife also favores black but is undecided and our kitchen designer is actively trying to discourage us from the black option.  
Please help us decide!  
**Dark pros (in our opinion ofc):**  
\-Looks modern/fancier  
\-Might age better?  
\-Matches better with the black window&door frames  
\-Feels cozier (to me, my wife sais both options are equally cozy)

**Dark cons:**  
\-Reddit is full of horror stories about dirt/fingerprints, etc...  
\-Might not fully match the rest of the house (boho style)  
\-Our kitchen designer

**White pros:**  
\-Safer/classical option?  
\-Might age worse?  
\-Might match better with the rest of the house (boho style)

**White cons:**  
\-Maybe too much wood (floor+vertical fronta panels)

The pictures are DIY renders we did of the 2 options.

What are your experiences with black kitchens?

My first virgin review (2nd cruise) so I thought I'd share my experience two parter- Cruise itself and the noro outbreak

**CRUISE**

  
I really enjoy virgin as a line in general. It's fun and mature without being classless. Things I enjoyed about the ship:

* The social club- really liked being able to sit down and play a board game anytime plus being able to join in on karaoke and trivia was awesome. Plus prize for winning? Round of drinks. Probably my favorite place on the ship.
* The Galley- I really like the options for all the food. I do wish it was slightly faster to get food but I understand for handing purposes. My DH obsession was the burger of the day. I loved the salad and soup of the day.
* Ground Club- less money then I spend at shops at home so it's a win. Coffee is soso but it does the job. 
* Dock House- their opa hour has some tasty food
* The Manor- I love the shows and some game shows in there. I do wish there was more seating but I understand it. 
* Gunbae- sometimes I think meeting new people is fun then sometimes it's just awkward 
* Extra Virgin- LOVED the potato gnocchi with the truffle butter sauce. I'm still thinking about it. The affogato tableside is a nice touch. 
* Test Kitchen- it's a must. Doesn't matter if you don't like the food, it's the experience that counts. Waitress said she has no disillusion that people go get food in the galley after. Highly recommend the cocktail/mocktail pairings since sometimes those are the most fun. 
*  Pink Agave- this one is the best fall back for always good food. They're innovative without being over the top. Never had a bad meal here yet. MIL said it was one of the best prime ribs she ever had. 
* The Wake- honestly nothing special. 
* Razzle Dazzle- the beet perogies and nashville cauliflower were hits. I feel like it's best to go veg here since their meat products do not stand out well. 
* The Diva is my life. She said she loved me during karaoke so I will be riding that high for a few more weeks. It's like being granted knighthood of fabulousness. 
* All staff was the sweetest and most knowledgeable while telling it like it is. Except sailor services. I'm unsure why they all look deer in headlights. 
* Stargazers is one of my favorite activities to do. I did it on my last cruise too. Get there early to snag a seat/bed. It's so relaxing. 
* Wifi was decent. I really don't need streaming on vacation but being able to text people back home is a really good feature I didn't realize I needed on a cruise. 
* Even if you're not a huge bingo fan, go to watch. They make it like a literal game show. So fun!
* We did a lock it in insider and got upgraded to a sea terrace. My DH loved the hammock. The rain shower and being able to switch to handle nozzle made my shower experience excellent. Bed was ok. I highly, highly recommend ringing a portable collapsible fan. It was a game charger for us. 
* Scarlet night is my favorite. I went all out with a glitter dress, jewels, glasses, tats. Have fun with it. Some people wear a red shirt and call it good, some go all out. Whatever you feel best in. I'm try even zanier next time. 
* Shore Things for this itinerary:
   * **Split**\- We originally booked the eat like a local tour but it got canceled so we opted for the ""Ancient Salona and Medieval Tragar"". It was decent tour. We went through ruins, old church and medieval walled neighborhood. We had about an hour to wander before heading back to the bus. My group took the time to get a soup (split pea and feta and yes it was delicious) at a local place overlooking the water. It was a bit confusing finding out way back but we managed. 
   * **Dubrovnik**\- booked the ""winemakers of Konvale Valley"". Highly recommend!! We went to 2 different local wineries and had the most picturesque time. Wine was great too. This is for the wine people and those that want excellent pictures. 
   * **Kotor**\- oof. The main complain is the tender fiasco. We were 45 min late to our tour ""Montenegro highlights"". The tour guide was excellent, learned a lot but it is a LONG day. We went up the mountains (1.5hr drive), winding roads, stopped at a town, went to see the royal palace museum which backed us up because they only allow one group at a time, then back down to a town tour. Because we were so late, we didn't have time to do the town tour. I think Kotor is beautiful and next time will walk around the town instead but am still glad I got to see the smaller mountain towns. It should probably start earlier in the day honestly cause of traffic. 
   * **Mykonos**\- ""Myconian Meze and organic vineyard"" was the perfect highlight tour for me. We got to see a little of the rural side of Mykonos and tried wine. We also walked through the town a bit. It also leaves you enough time to wander afterwards. 

Things I wished were a little better:

* Communication. The lack of information to guests was hindering. Especially regarding the tenders and virus. We're all adults. Most of us can roll with changes. 
* More bathrooms. I felt like I traveled the seven seas to get to a women's bathroom. 
* The app is annoying. I like the push notifications and chat feature. However, the inability to see the schedules off the ship? Nonexistent and inconvenient. I do think they should enable a group chat option so everybody can be in contact. 
* I do wish there were slightly more activities during scarlet night like games/competitions. Just a thought and kind of wish I had put it in my survey. 

  
**NOROVIRUS: TMI**

Day 9- MIL hadn't fallen ill on the sea day. She was fine during tea time and then said she didn't feel well and couldn't join us for dinner. Okay that's fine. Around 11pm that night she said she went to medical and they're putting her in isolation since she was vomiting/diarrhea. We thought maybe food poisoning. Kept in touch with her via app. 

Day 10- DH dropped food off to his mom in the AM even though crew already did. She said she felt a bit better but tired and couldn't come out anyway. I ended up nauseous after breakfast. This lasted almost all of my tour in Mykonos. It came and went. By dinner time, my appetite was small and thought maybe I was just bloated (which can make one feel nauseous). I felt very tired and decided to call it early. Persephone was canceled so it solidified my plans to just retire early. MIL said she felt better but just tired. 

By 7pm I knew something wasn't right. I ended up vomiting. Laid back down and then it never stopped. My husband had to open the balcony door because the smell. Once all the food was gone, I got diarrhea (only once surprisingly). Then it just continued forever. 8 hours straight, every 15 minutes. Nothing helped- water, bread to soak up acid, dramamine. Though it wasn't too much bile.  

Day 11- Very early AM, around 4am, I've had enough. I knew this wasn't food poisoning. Something was NOT right so I sent my husband down to medical to get some medicine. He came back to me barely able to get up the floor, had to pick me up and guide me to medical since they yelled at him to bring me down. They got me hooked up to IV right away. I was so dehydrated, I had to get two IV bags. I hadn't slept, everything was cloudy. 

Doc gave my husband nausea pills for me to take home because welp it's disembarkation day and I gotta go. He went back to the room to finish packing and took about 45 min. He came back down and said he talked to his mom and she was ordered to be off the ship by 7am. So we couldn't really contact her because ship wifi doesn't work well in port and the app is useless. So my MIL was outside in limbo, waiting for us. 

7:30 rolls around and greek health officials have boarded the ship. I heard her keep asking ""how does this happen? How??"" and the doc was flustered. My DH brought my clothes to change into and I left nauseous but hadn't vomited in 3 hours so hooray. I was still so weak though. I didn't realize they were evacuating all the sick off the ship until our room got paged to leave. Husband asked doc about paperwork for insurance or if we could fly and he gave us the okay if I stopped showing symptoms by 12pm. They were hurrying us off, giving us gloves and masks and putting us on a bus. I was so tired and weak I had to be practically carried by my husband to board. 

My MiL told crew she refused to leave without her kids so was waiting for us at the pier and we all got sent to the airport. I don't believe this was the right choice honestly. I passed out on the airport benches for hours and wore my masks and gloves/changing them every few hours. We ended up flying later that night which I regret but I was so OUT of it, I let my husband and MIL make the decisions for me. I took as many precautions as I could and basically slept the whole flight home. 

Later we got an email about a ""stomach flu"" outbreak which I know not to be true. They sent 3-4 buses of those sick or in former isolation to the airport. I think about how insane that is. If I had been thinking clearly, I would've stayed over night before flying but exhaustion does weird things. Also, husband got lucky since he never got sick. 

I don't wish this on anyone. I don't think virgin handled it well. I'm not gonna stop cruising with them but I believe they will improve from feedback as their sorry letter seemed mostly sincere. They also gave us some future credit.

Every other day, at 5AM, I strength train for 1hr15mins and have 30mins cardio, while on rest days I average between 13 to 15k steps, I would define myself as pretty active. So there is another 8hours between training and first meal.

I track my calories and macros and try to eat in a small deficit (Around 3 to 400 calories) until I get my target physique to then start a slow bulk...weight loss is going ok and it's sustainable in this way, since I like having lesser meals but larger instead of multiple small ones. Been doing IF mainly for gut rest and to help with food noise which was unbearable before. I have made so much progress on this and I love it. I can finally manage my hunger most of the times, and also manage a few binge episodes I've had.

One of the issue I have developed lately is an intense light headed feeling that affect the back of my head, it's very uncomfortable. They start middle of the morning and seem to fade in the afternoon. I can cope with them, but usually they get intense and not a nice side effect.

Would you suggest to start having electrolytes to see if this goes away? I thought these would be only for fasts over 24/36hrs. Is there any around zero calories and no artificial flavouring available in the UK? I don't want anything with calories and especially with flavourings, since my fast only consists of water (still and sparkling) and black coffee with a dash of cinnamon.

Also, is eating that long after a workout going to affect muscle growth in any way?

 I was thinking to keep sticking to 2 meals a day, but have the first one after the workout, around 10/11AM and have the second(and last) again at 7PM, but this wouldn't be IF anymore and not sure if that's the right way to go, since I don't want to mess up my routine.

the allure of open concept living continues to captivate homeowners in 2025,especially those seeking to maximize space in smaller dwellings. Open concept small house floor plans offer a modern, airy feel, promoting connection and functionality within a limited footprint.

## Key Features Analysis

Effective open concept small house plans rely on strategic design choices to create functional and visually appealing spaces.

**Zoned Living Areas:** zoning involves defining different areas within the open space using furniture arrangement, area rugs, and subtle transitions in flooring.This approach creates distinct zones for living, dining, and cooking without the need for walls. These zones help to maintain a sense of order and purpose within the unified space.

Different heights and features in elements define the boundaries of each area, such as a sectional sofa denoting the living room, or a breakfast bar which separates the kitchen from the dining area.

**Strategic Window Placement:** Maximizing natural light is crucial in small spaces. Large windows, strategically placed to capture sunlight throughout the day, can brighten the interior and create a sense of openness. Clerestory windows (high windows near the ceiling) are a particularly effective option, as they provide light while maintaining privacy. Skylights also provide natural illumination without sacrificing wall space.

Careful consideration of both the direction and size are essential in using light to open a living space, rather than allowing for harsh overexposure and negative space.

**Flexible Furniture Solutions:** Multifunctional furniture is a must-have for open concept small houses. Sofas that convert into beds, coffee tables with hidden storage, and expandable dining tables are all excellent choices. These pieces adapt to different needs and activities, making the most of the available space.Wall-mounted desks or foldable tables can also provide a workspace that can be easily tucked away when not in use.

These pieces are generally minimal in design, following the same contemporary aesthetics of an open-space floorplan.

**Vertical Storage:** Utilizing vertical space can substantially increase storage capacity without taking up valuable floor area. Tall bookshelves, wall-mounted cabinets, and hanging organizers can help declutter the space and keep belongings organized. Consider built-in storage solutions to seamlessly integrate storage into the design.Open shelving is common, with simple designs and a focus on the ability to quickly and easily reorganize and access storage.**Minimalist Design Elements:** Embracing a minimalist aesthetic is essential for creating a sense of calm and spaciousness in a small open concept home. Clutter can quickly overwhelm a small space,so it's important to carefully curate belongings and prioritize functionality. Opt for clean lines,neutral colors,and simple décor.

Fewer belongings also equate to a smaller carbon footprint and encourage a more lasting, financially lean way of living.

**Smart Technology Integration:** modern small house plans often incorporate smart technology to enhance convenience and energy efficiency. Smart lighting systems can be programmed to adjust brightness and color temperature automatically, while smart thermostats can optimize heating and cooling. Voice-controlled devices can further streamline daily tasks.

Being able to easily control devices from a single mobile device also limits clutter with physical remotes and clunky electronics.

## Core Benefits

Open concept small house floor plans offer a range of benefits that significantly enhance the living experience.

**enhanced Social Interaction:** The open layout fosters a sense of connection and togetherness. Family members can easily interact while engaged in different activities, whether cooking, relaxing, or working. This makes it ideal for families with young children or individuals who enjoy entertaining.

Open space living encourages guests and residents alike to mingle and be present.

**Greater Flexibility:** The absence of dividing walls provides greater flexibility in how the space is used. The living area can easily be reconfigured to accommodate different needs, such as hosting a party, setting up a home office, or creating a play area for children.

Furniture can easily be rearranged, or moved from the space altogether.

**Improved Natural Light and Ventilation:** With fewer walls obstructing the flow of air and light, open concept homes tend to be brighter and better ventilated. This creates a more pleasant and energy-efficient living environment.Natural light can also boost mood and productivity.

Lack of stagnant air means that temperature remains consistent irrespective of the season, creating a comfortable and energy-efficient environment.

**Increased Perceived Space:** By removing walls, open concept designs create the illusion of greater space. This is particularly beneficial in small houses where maximizing the perceived square footage is a priority. Light and air flow freely, making the house feel larger and more inviting.

This can reduce stress and positively impact mental health when living in a smaller space.

**Modern Aesthetic:** Open concept layouts align with contemporary design trends, offering a sleek and stylish living environment. The clean lines and uncluttered spaces create a modern aesthetic that appeals to many homeowners.

Simplicity means a decreased likelihood of becoming outdated as well.

## FAQs Section

**Are open concept floor plans suitable for all climates?**
Open concept floor plans can be adapted to various climates, but careful consideration should be given to insulation and ventilation. In colder climates, proper insulation is essential to prevent heat loss. In warmer climates, adequate ventilation and shading are necessary to keep the house cool. Efficient HVAC systems are also crucial for maintaining comfortable temperatures.

Different materials may also be used to further regulate temperature.

**How do you address privacy concerns in an open concept layout?**
Privacy can be addressed in open concept layouts through strategic furniture placement, the use of screens or partitions, and careful window placement. Tall bookshelves, curtains, or folding screens can create a sense of separation between different zones. Consider the placement of windows to minimize visibility from the outside.

Plants can also be used to add privacy, particularly taller varieties that can easily create a barrier.

**What types of flooring are best suited for open concept small houses?**
The flooring should be consistent throughout the open area to create a cohesive look.Durable and easy-to-clean options like hardwood, laminate, or tile are good choices. Area rugs can be used to define different zones and add warmth and texture.

Luxury Vinyl Plank is also a popular option,offering the look and feel of authentic wood without the maintenance.

**Memory Transcription Subject:** Doctor Willow Robins, Biologist


**Date [standardized human time]:** October 24, 2145


No one hates Venili, including me, but I come damn close sometimes, let me tell you. See, I’m not as affected by their ‘cuteness’ as others are, it’s a skill that comes in hand working with animals, so I get to see everything that’s wrong with them. Mainly the fact that they are walking ecological disasters!


I hit my closed fist against my head a few times before looking back to the reports the UN managed to wrestle away from the Exterminators. They wanted to drop fucking anti-matter bombs on the colony! And the only reason they didn’t was because those are going towards the war effort, so instead they’ve just been lighting the poor buggers on fire. It was giving me flashbacks to the wildfires back home.


I lifted my visor enough to take a sip from my coffee, taking a moment to sooth my nerves like I was brushing down the hackles of an angry cat, except instead of a cat I was a pissed off 40-something year old woman (there is a joke about cougars in here somewhere, but I’m too tired to make it).


Before I could devote myself to losing even more hope in our sheep-like companions, I heard a knock at my door.


“Come in.” I simply said, as it creaked open to reveal an Exterminator, clad in their heat-proof suit.
“Speak of the Devil.” 


“What?”


“Nothing, why are you bothering me?” I don’t have much patience for their ilk at the best of times, and nearing midnight was especially not helping. If jetlag handn’t fucked up my sleep schedual I would have had some much more colorful things to say, and the fact that Kavas-4 had a 27 hour day was not helping.


“W-we got something you may be interested in. Uh, a predator.” as much as I hated to admit it, she was right, I was, indeed, interested. Mostly because I was trying to figure out why they didn’t just torch it on the spot.


“Exterminator Guild?”


“It’s there, y-yes.”


“Let me grab my coat, give me a moment.”


**[Memory Skipped: Reason: Unimportant]**


It didn’t take long to get there, my lab was worryingly close to their guild, something about predator taint prevention (makes me vomit a bit in my mouth), but it was a blessing now, as I slipped through the doors alongside the random Exterminator, into the building, with its utilitarian halls and biting fluorescent lights, as soon as I was pointed in the right direction I was off like a rocket, quickly finding myself at the threshold of a door labeled “Predator Taint Containment Area” according to my translator.


“Isn’t this where you usually keep junk covered in blood and ash?”


“Well, yes, but we’re not quite equipped to handle living creatures.” she muttered.


“So why isn’t this poor bastard dead as sin?”


“You see, we were planning on it, but the humans on our staff had a lot of objections, saying that it looked-” they began as I opened the door, entering to the room filled with junk, stuff that was on the docket to be burnt, but in the center was a little bugger behind a cell door, probably used to hold people with ‘predator decease’ or something. About as tall as one of the Ven, it was utterly hairless, with little beady eyes and a mouth full of little crushing teeth. It had big mouse ears and pointy claws. If I had to sum it up, it was a Naked Mole Rat person. After registering that, I quickly noticed it was wearing pelts, a sort of fur toga, with a pouch made from an animal stomach by his waist.
“-sentient”


I was not equipped for this. I sighed, well, at least this one was cute, though I’m not sure anyone else would agree with me. I always found the weird creepy crawlies more than the fluffy big eyed things. Just wish it didn’t stink like a corpse baking in the sun.


“Does it have a translator?”

“It does, yes, they just implanted it, but the thing is-”


“VILE WRETCHED SHIT-MOUNDS! FIRE TOATING FUCKHEADS! MAY YOUR WATER BE SOILED AND YOUR FOOD BE POISONED! DIE IN A FIRE!” The thing spat at us while hunched in the dark corner of its cell.
“ALL THREE OF YOU!”


“Uh, there are two of us.” I noted.


“TWO, THREE, SEVEN! GAH! CAN’T SEE!” it said, before returning to its hissing and chittering, sounding like a swarm of crickets in a washing machine. I looked over the thing, again, earning me what I assume would be a worried look from the Exterminator, though she was too busy trying to kill the rat-man with her mind.


“What’s your name?” I asked my Exterminator.


“Javil.” she muttered, seemingly unwilling to look away from the raat.
“Seems feral, I saw we burned it.” she added.


“Well I’m the doctor here and I say kill the lights, I want to test something.” 


Javil went to protest, but she did it anyway, probably because she felt my eyes on her. Walking over to a control panel, she shut down the lights, plunging us into complete darkness. Even though my eyes were taking their sweet time adjusting to the dark, however, my gambit worked, and I couldn’t hear our guest throwing profanities at me any longer. I walked over to the cage.


“There we are, mate, probably can’t see in the light with those peepers.” I said, getting nothing but silence from the creature.
“You got a name? Mine’s Willow.”


“[Land Walker].” the translation buzzed after a short delay, though I noticed that there was a pause between the creature saying the words and them getting relayed to me.


“Alright, we’re getting somewhere. You hungry Land Walker?” I asked, but I could hear Javil audibly blanch.


“Doctor! Did you bring preditor food into our guild?!” 


“Pipe down will you, I don’t have anything on me you couldn’t eat,” I grumbled as I took my bag off, “but our friend here has the dental makeup of an omnivore.” I added, before turning to Land Walker.
“Can you eat plants buddy?” I asked, eliciting a strange chittering sound.


“Can’t everyone?” he asked with a growl.


“More than you’d ever know.” I muttered before pulling free a plum. It was going to be a late night snack, and honestly parting with it was harder than I expected, but as much as I wanted a taste of home, I needed something to get into Land Walker’s good graces. Gently I placed the plum on the ground and rolled it through the bars. The fruit was quickly nabbed up by the moleman’s greedy little claws.
“Fair wanring, it’s got a seed in the middle, so don’t bite into it, otherwise you might get sick.” I warned.


He grunted at me, however still he used his claws to… not quite cut into the fruit, but rip it in half, before munching on the plum.


“You know, you Humans are far to forgiving. First the fucking Arxur now this.” the Venili spoke, her voice dripping with venom that almost made me forget that this was the same kind of person to piss themselves at seeing a pug.


“What’s that suppost to mean, pipsqeak?”


“It’s a monster! It eats people! I saw him chewing on Veal’s leg like it was a carrot!” she roared at me, though her yelling caught the attention of Land Walker, who looked up from his decident meal.


“Obviously I ate them, do you want them to be stuck there!”


“YOU SAID THAT ALREADY BUT IT STILL DOESN’T MEAN ANYTHING!”


“YOU DON”T DESERVE ANWSER MAD THING-”


And just like that, the yelling started again. God I wish I had some ibiprophen.

Now imagine being eternal, like actual never-ending infinite space with nothing but the echo of your own divine thoughts for company. No Netflix, no emotional damage to heal from, not even a bad haircut to regret. Just... love. Pure. Undiluted. Blissful. Like a hot tub that never goes cold—but you’ve been in it for 400 trillion years and you’re starting to wonder what it’d be like to drown.

So what does God do? The most chaotic thing imaginable. She splits into 8 billion little meat-suits, sprinkles herself across galaxies like cosmic glitter, and gives everyone amnesia. No spoilers. No cheat codes. Just sentient apes with back pain, anxiety, and opinions about pineapple on pizza. She doesn’t want to watch the drama—She wants to be the drama. Because apparently, being the all-seeing eye gets old when there’s nothing juicy to see.

Now you’re here. On Earth. A spiritual entity stuffed into a skeleton carrying around a fragile ego like it’s a Fabergé egg. You’ve got bills, heartbreak, eczema, and this strange suspicion that maybe—just maybe—you were meant for something more than refreshing your email like it’s the oracle of Delphi. That’s God. That’s you. Bored. Curious. Playing hide and seek with your own face.

And the game is rigged to be hard. Because love without contrast is like sugar without salt—it gets cloying, spiritual diabetes of the soul. So we get rage, fear, Reddit arguments, toddler tantrums in the produce aisle. We get war and love songs and people who use the word “synergy” unironically. All so that love, when it finally arrives, feels like relief. Like an exhale. Like remembering you had a parachute the whole damn time.

This whole thing? Earth? Trauma? Tinder dates with men named Brad who “aren’t emotionally available right now”? It’s divine improv. God said, “Let there be light,” and then tripped over a rake into your childhood. And you—you glorious soft idiot—you volunteered for this. You hit “I agree” on the soul contract like it was a software update and now here you are, screaming into the void, asking why love hurts.

Because if it didn’t, you’d never look for it. If you remembered who you were, you’d never want to. And God, in Her infinite wisdom, knew that forgetting would make the remembering feel like fireworks under the ribs. So She became you, and now She’s laughing through your lungs, wondering how long it’ll take for you to remember it was all on purpose.



Welcome to Earth: Shit’s Trying to Kill You (Or Is It?)

So you landed on Earth. Condolences. You’ve been dropped into a simulated meat grinder wearing a T-shirt that says “Empath” and no one gave you a manual. Everything has teeth. The weather. Your job. That weird noise in your car that only happens when you're broke. You showed up with amnesia and a nervous system that thinks every vibe shift is a potential lion attack.

And your reward? A culture that feeds you Hot Pockets, unpaid parking tickets, and a vague sense of doom you can’t quite name. It’s like your soul got cast in Survivor: Planet Edition and they forgot to tell you the only way to win is to stop playing. But you don’t know that yet. You’re still dodging emotional debris like it’s Mario Kart and mistaking red flags for “growth opportunities.”

Let’s get something straight: you were born into a survival simulation coded by an overstimulated God with a flair for drama. The game looks real. Your landlord feels real. That cough you Googled at 2AM that turned into 16 different terminal illnesses? Very real. Until it’s not. Because here’s the big cosmic joke: the entire simulation runs on belief. Like, literally. You think gravity keeps you down? It’s your expectations. You think life is pain? Boom, front-row seats to the shitshow. You think you're safe? Cue the symphony of synchronicities and gluten-free joy.

Fear is the factory setting, sure. But it’s outdated. Your soul came pre-installed with a dial that turns “perceived threat” into “cosmic improv.” Problem is, nobody teaches you how to use it. Instead, you get anxiety, childhood trauma, and a subscription to Amazon Prime. Welcome to the matrix, kid. Hope you like bills and generational shame.

But some people—those suspiciously glowing weirdos who talk to plants and always find $20 on the sidewalk—they figured it out. They uninstalled fear.exe and installed “vibes don’t lie” instead. They flirt with the universe like it's a bartender who owes them a favor. They walk through traffic with the audacity of a saint on mushrooms. They remember that none of this is trying to kill them. Unless they say it is. And then it does. Politely.

So yes, the world appears to be one big existential laser tag match. But if you stop flinching, stop ducking imaginary bullets, and just stare the beast in the mouth with your third eye open and middle fingers up—you realize it was cardboard all along. The monster deflates. The nightmare ends. And the cosmic stagehands apologize for the mix-up and offer you kombucha.



The Cosmic Loophole – Belief is the Remote Control

Here’s the part they don’t tell you in school because school is mostly just a trauma factory with vending machines: reality is optional. Not in the woo-woo, drink-your-urine-and-hug-a-tree way (though, no shade if that’s your thing), but in the literally, quantum-mechanically proven, physicists-are-sweating-in-their-lab-coats kind of way. Everything is belief. Everything. Belief is the remote control, and you’ve been sitting on it while screaming at the screen.

You think your thoughts are just little brain farts echoing through the void? No. They’re vote ballots. Every time you think “I’m broke,” the universe nods solemnly like an exhausted cashier and goes, “Coming right up—one extra dose of poverty with a side of delayed paychecks.” You believe people always leave? They do. You believe love is dangerous? Get ready for a sexy demolition derby. You believe the world is conspiring to help you? Suddenly there’s a sale on self-worth and a stranger buys your coffee while calling you radiant.

It’s all a magic trick. A divine improv show where you’re both the magician and the idiot in the front row going, “How’d he do that!?” Because belief isn’t a thought—it’s a spell. Not the abracadabra kind. The real kind. The kind you whisper to yourself at 3AM. The kind your mom accidentally programmed into your bones when she told you not to be “too much.” The kind that makes grown men fear intimacy and women apologize for existing.

And the worst part? Belief doesn’t care if it’s true. It doesn’t fact-check. It’s like the universe is a stoned genie on a smoke break. You say, “I suck,” and it’s like, “Bet.” You say, “I deserve joy,” and it shrugs, “Okay, sure, have some.” It’s not personal. It’s just the settings you left on from the last time you incarnated as a medieval peasant with unresolved daddy issues.

The moment you get this—really get this—is the moment shit starts bending. Money shows up where there was dust. Lovers appear mid-sentence. Time slows down just enough for you to notice that nothing was ever chasing you except your own unexamined certainty. Belief is the steering wheel, and you’ve been white-knuckling fear when you could’ve been flooring it in joy with the windows down and the theme song to your own damn movie blasting.

So yeah, it’s funny. Hilarious even. You, a literal fractal of God, spending years thinking you’re not good enough while the entire cosmos sits in the audience like, “Any minute now they’ll remember they wrote the script.”



The Goal is Love (But the Map is Made of Monsters)

So here’s the kicker: after all the chaos, the rent payments, the spiritual influencers selling enlightenment for $1,111, the real goal—the final mission—the glowing artifact at the center of the labyrinth is Love. Not the Disney version with twinkly eyes and matching pajamas. I mean capital-L Love. The kind that rips your spine out, boils your shame like soup bones, and tapes a mirror to your forehead and says, “Look.”

And just to be extra twisted, the universe maps the way to this Love using monsters. Childhood wounds dressed in mom’s perfume. Exes with your same abandonment issues and a minor god complex. Bosses who trigger your unhealed father hunger. And every single one of them is just a breadcrumb trail back to your own damn heart. Cute, right?

This isn’t some sparkle-fart lesson about “seeing the good in everyone.” This is about dragging your inner saboteur out of the crawl space, making it a cup of tea, and saying, “I know why you tried to burn everything down. You thought it would keep us safe.” Forgiveness isn’t weakness. It’s spiritual jiu-jitsu. It’s the moment you realize every villain in your life was secretly auditioning for the role of your healer.

Because Love—real Love—isn’t some blissed-out stasis chamber. It’s an acid bath for the lie of separation. It’s dying while still breathing. It’s every part of you that you rejected walking back into the room wearing a party hat and asking for cake. Love is when the armor rusts off and you’re left naked, weeping, radiant—and laughing like a lunatic because you realize all the pain was you, loving yourself in reverse.

And yeah, you’ll resist it. You’ll sprint in the other direction. You’ll sabotage it, ghost it, mock it, write sarcastic essays about it. Until you don’t. Until something breaks—clean—and the monster you were fighting turns around and asks if you want to dance.

That's the secret: the monsters weren’t enemies. They were initiation rituals in drag. Every heartbreak, every betrayal, every time you stared at the ceiling wondering if God ghosted you—it was Love wearing its scariest costume, seeing if you were ready to stop running and finally say: I remember you.

So yeah. Love wins. But only after it kicks your ass, forgives you anyway, and teaches you how to hug the thing you once tried to destroy.



What Happens When You Win? (Spoiler: You Start Over)

So you’ve done it. You’ve kissed your monsters on the mouth, danced barefoot in your own grave, and remembered that you were God the whole time. Congratulations. You unlocked the cheat codes, disarmed the trauma mines, and folded reality into a love letter addressed to yourself. The final scene plays out. The curtain drops. The crowd (also you) gives a standing ovation.

And then?

You respawn. Like some kind of metaphysical Pokémon with unresolved curiosity. You pop back into existence in a different body, a different timeline, a different trauma-flavored escape room—because apparently, eternal consciousness is a junkie for growth opportunities. You thought the prize for enlightenment was eternal peace? Nah. It’s a rerun. Except this time, you’re laughing your ass off on the way down the birth canal.

You don’t come back to escape the game—you come back because you loved playing it. The taste of grief. The static crackle of first kisses. The way a sunset makes you forget your name. The moment you forgive your mom. The time your dog looked at you like you were the whole damn sky. These things are addictive. They’re sticky. They’re holy. And once you remember that pain and pleasure were just costumes at the same divine rave, you start requesting encores.

Except now you know. Now the monsters show up and you wink. The bills arrive and you smirk. The heartbreak hits and you say, “Okay, Love, I see what costume you're wearing today.” You become the enlightened idiot. The cosmic jester. The one who’s been through hell and decided to plant flowers there.

Because the truth is, “winning” the game doesn’t mean ascending into some sterile cloud kingdom where everyone talks like Siri and hugs last for eternity. That’s not the vibe. Winning means you stop playing scared. You play loose. You play in technicolor. You teach others how to laugh while bleeding. You become the glitch in the matrix—the one who remembers this whole damn carnival is made of light, but still rides the tilt-a-whirl for fun.

My husband worked as a prep cook for the last 3 years in a locally owned and operated coffee and sandwich place (exactly 14 employees). He had issues with one particular coworker we'll call Lily. Lily is the ex sister-in-law of the owner. She barely did any work, never cleaned, and had attendance problems. After multiple complaints, management eventually convinced the owner to let them fire her.

A few months later, Lily was rehired, with the promise she'd be terminated if she didn't stay in line. Last Thursday she was making potato salad and husband asked her if she knew the recipe changed. There was some back and forth about the changes and he finally just took the recipe binder over and put it on the counter next to her. When he returned to his station, the binder hit him. There was an argument. Lily was asked to go to the manager's office to talk, but refused and said she quit. My husband admits he yelled in her face to ""just get out then"". She left.

The next day, his manager told him the owner was forcing her to fire him and handed him paperwork claiming he was ""verbally abusive and created a hostile work environment which forced another employee to quit."" He's devastated. He loved that job, except Lily. He has copies of yearly reviews that all say what a great worker he is. He's even more upset that he's being called abusive and will now have a lot of difficulty finding work. 

The legal: I told him to go file a report for being hit with the book. If they're going to claim he was abusive, Lily needs to answer for her part. I also told him we could sue for wrongful termination on the basis of assault and nepotism, even though we really can't afford a lawyer. I'm hoping the threat of legal action will be enough to negotiate for what he wants: they change the paperwork to state he left voluntarily due to hostile work environment (on their part, not his).

Now the manager is saying that's going to make things worse and implying the owner will sue him (not sure on what grounds). She also told him Lily was trying to toss the book to where it goes and hit him accidentally, which even Lily didn't claim in the day it happened. All this makes him want to drop the charges.

So, do we drop the battery charges and let it go or do I rob our savings and see a lawyer?

It features 240 handcrafted image-based puzzles, including tile swapping, rotation, and a unique mode I call the “Rotem puzzle.” It’s meant to be relaxing, beautiful, and gently challenging — like something you can enjoy over coffee or late at night.

That's the allure of an ""all-inclusive"" getaway, isn't it? Picture this: sun-drenched beaches, endless piña coladas, and not a single worry about budgeting for every meal or activity. It's a slice of paradise, a complete package designed to soothe the soul and invigorate the spirit. But how does JetBlue, that beloved airline known for its snappy service and free Wi-Fi, fit into this picture? Are they just flying you *to* the all-inclusive dream, or are they weaving the magic themselves? Let's unravel the mystery of JetBlue's all-inclusive offerings and see if they truly deliver the whole enchilada.

Unpacking the Pineapple: What Exactly is JetBlue All Inclusive?
---------------------------------------------------------------

You know the feeling, right? The excitement of planning a vacation warring with the headache of booking flights, hotels, transfers, and activities separately. It's enough to make your head spin. That's where the beauty of an all-inclusive package comes in. It's like a perfectly wrapped present, everything you need bundled together for one price. But ""all-inclusive"" can be a bit of a chameleon, meaning different things to different people and different companies. So, when we talk about **JetBlue all inclusive**, what specific features and amenities are we talking about? Are we talking about just the flight and hotel, or are we talking about a full-blown, everything-included, don't-lift-a-finger experience? It's time to peel back the layers and see what's truly on offer.

### Beyond the Flight: Digging into JetBlue's Vacation Packages

Let's cut to the chase: JetBlue doesn't own a string of resorts where they offer a purely in-house all-inclusive experience like some hotel chains do. Think of them more as your friendly neighborhood travel agent in the sky. What they *do* offer are attractive vacation packages that often include a flight *and* hotel, and these hotel options frequently *are* all-inclusive resorts. Voilà! You're getting that sought-after **JetBlue all inclusive** experience, just with a different model.

So, instead of building their own resorts from the ground up, JetBlue partners with a wide array of reputable hotels and resorts in popular vacation destinations. This gives you, the traveler, a fantastic range of choices. Want a sprawling family-friendly resort with water parks and kids' clubs? Check. Prefer a boutique adults-only escape with gourmet dining? You got it. JetBlue curates these partnerships to offer diverse options that cater to different tastes and budgets.

Think of it like browsing a well-stocked online marketplace for vacations. JetBlue provides the platform and the flights, and their hotel partners provide the all-inclusive goodness. It’s a win-win, really. You get the convenience of booking everything together with JetBlue's reliable service, and you get access to a vast network of all-inclusive resort experiences.

### What's Typically Bundled Up? Decoding the ""All"" in All-Inclusive

Alright, so we know JetBlue bundles flights and hotel stays, but what about the ""all-inclusive"" aspect at those partnered resorts? This is where you need to pay close attention to the details, as ""all-inclusive"" isn't a one-size-fits-all term. Generally speaking, when you book a JetBlue vacation package to an all-inclusive resort, you can expect the following to be included in the price:

- **Accommodation:** Of course! Your comfortable room or suite is the foundation of your stay.
- **Meals:** This is a big one! Expect breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffets and/or à la carte dining options at various restaurants within the resort. Think endless plates of deliciousness without reaching for your wallet every time.
- **Drinks:** Beverages, including alcoholic drinks and non-alcoholic drinks, are typically included. This usually covers local beers, house wines, spirits, and, of course, plenty of refreshing cocktails and mocktails. However, premium brand liquors or imported wines might come at an extra cost, so it's always wise to double-check the resort's policy.
- **Activities and Entertainment:** Many all-inclusive resorts offer a packed schedule of activities. This can range from non-motorized water sports like kayaking and paddleboarding to poolside games, fitness classes, and evening entertainment like live music or shows.

However, and this is a crucial point, the level of ""all"" can vary significantly between resorts. Some might include unlimited access to specialty restaurants, while others might limit it to a certain number of visits per stay. Spa treatments, motorized water sports, and excursions outside the resort are almost always an additional cost. Think of it like getting the basic package with room to add on extra perks if you wish.

So, when you’re browsing those JetBlue vacation options, make sure to click on the resort details and really read what’s included. It’s like reading the fine print on a contract – nobody loves it, but it’s essential for avoiding any unpleasant surprises down the line.

Where Can You Go All-Inclusive with JetBlue? Tropical Dreams and Beyond!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fantastically, JetBlue flies to a slew of destinations where the all-inclusive resort scene is absolutely booming. We're talking about those idyllic spots where the sun shines bright, the water is crystal clear, and the biggest decision of the day is whether to lounge by the pool or the beach. So, if you've got a hankering for a worry-free escape, chances are JetBlue can get you there with an all-inclusive package.

### The Usual Suspects: Caribbean Paradise Awaiting

Ah, the Caribbean! It's practically synonymous with all-inclusive resorts. The islands offer a perfect blend of stunning natural beauty, vibrant culture, and a plethora of resorts designed to cater to your every whim. And guess what? JetBlue has you covered.

You'll find **JetBlue all inclusive** options in some of the most popular Caribbean hot spots:

1. **Dominican Republic:** Punta Cana, in particular, is an all-inclusive mecca. You'll find massive resorts with endless amenities, perfect for families and couples alike. JetBlue offers plenty of flights here, making it an easy choice for a quick getaway.
2. **Jamaica:** From the lively vibes of Montego Bay to the laid-back atmosphere of Negril, Jamaica offers a diverse range of all-inclusive experiences. Think reggae music, delicious jerk chicken, and stunning sunsets.
3. **Mexico:** While geographically not the Caribbean, the resort towns on the Caribbean Coast of Mexico, like Cancún, Playa del Carmen, and Riviera Maya, are massive players in the all-inclusive world. JetBlue flies directly to these popular destinations, opening up a treasure trove of resort choices.
4. **Aruba:** Known for its consistently sunny weather and beautiful beaches, Aruba is another fantastic spot for an all-inclusive escape. It's a bit drier and more desert-like than some other islands, offering a different kind of beauty.
5. **Turks and Caicos:** If you're looking for pristine beaches and turquoise waters, Turks and Caicos is the place to be. While perhaps a bit pricier than some other options, the resorts here often offer a higher level of luxury.
6. **St. Lucia:** With its dramatic Piton mountains and lush rainforests, St. Lucia offers a romantic and adventurous all-inclusive experience. Many resorts here cater to couples looking for a secluded and luxurious getaway.

This is by no means an exhaustive list, but it gives you a good idea of the incredible variety of Caribbean destinations you can explore with a **JetBlue all inclusive** package. The hardest part will be choosing just one!

### Beyond the Islands: Are There Other All-Inclusive Destinations?

Absolutely! While the Caribbean might be the poster child for all-inclusive, it's not the only game in town. JetBlue's network extends to other destinations where the all-inclusive concept is gaining traction, or where they partner with resorts that offer similar bundled experiences.

Think about places like:

- **Central America:** Countries like Costa Rica and Belize are increasingly offering all-inclusive or near-all-inclusive options, particularly in areas focused on adventure and eco-tourism. While perhaps not the massive resort style of the Caribbean, you can still find packages that bundle accommodations, meals, and activities in a beautiful and unique setting.
- **Other Parts of Mexico:** Beyond the Caribbean coast, you can find all-inclusive resorts on the Pacific coast of Mexico, like in Puerto Vallarta or Cabo San Lucas. JetBlue flies to these destinations as well, opening up even more possibilities for a sunny escape.

While the bulk of JetBlue’s all-inclusive offerings are concentrated in the Caribbean and Mexican hotspots, it's always worth checking their vacation package site to see if they've added new destinations or partnered with resorts in unexpected places. You never know where your next worry-free vacation might take you!

Is a JetBlue All Inclusive Package Right for You? Weighing the Pros and Cons
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, the idea of a worry-free vacation where everything is paid for upfront sounds pretty darn appealing, right? But is a **JetBlue all inclusive** package the right fit for *your* travel style and preferences? Like anything in life, there are pros and cons to consider. Let's put on our thinking caps and weigh them carefully.

### The Sunny Side: Why Going All-Inclusive with JetBlue Might Be Your Best Bet

There are some seriously compelling reasons to opt for a bundled all-inclusive package through JetBlue. They can genuinely make your vacation experience smoother and more enjoyable. Here’s why you might want to jump on board:

- **Budgeting Made Easy:** This is a huge one! Knowing the vast majority of your costs are covered upfront takes a massive weight off your shoulders. No more constantly calculating expenses or feeling guilty about ordering that extra cocktail. It’s like having a magic envelope of vacation money that never runs out (within the all-inclusive boundaries, of course!). This predictability is fantastic for managing your vacation budget and avoiding nasty surprises.
- **Convenience, Convenience, Convenience:** Booking your flight and hotel together in one fell swoop is a major time saver. No hopping between different websites, trying to sync up arrival and check-in times, or dealing with separate payment processes. JetBlue streamlines the entire process, leaving you with more time to daydream about those sandy beaches.
- **Less Decision Fatigue:** When you’re on vacation, you want to relax, not constantly make decisions about where to eat or what to do. With an all-inclusive package, many of those choices are made for you. You have access to multiple dining options and a range of included activities right at your fingertips. It frees up your brain space to truly unwind.
- **Potential Cost Savings:** Often, bundling your flight and hotel together can result in a lower overall cost than booking them separately. JetBlue, like other airlines offering vacation packages, often negotiates favorable rates with their hotel partners, and these savings can be passed on to you. While not always guaranteed to be cheaper, it's definitely worth comparing the package price to booking individually.
- **Access to Amenities and Activities:** All-inclusive resorts are typically packed with amenities – multiple pools, bars, restaurants, gyms, and often a variety of included activities like non-motorized water sports or entertainment. It’s like having a mini-city of fun right at your resort, and it’s all part of the package.
- **Peace of Mind:** Knowing that your core vacation needs – flying and staying – are taken care of provides a wonderful sense of peace of mind. You can relax and look forward to your trip without worrying about last-minute logistical nightmares.

For many travelers, especially families or those looking for a truly relaxing and predictable getaway, these pros can heavily outweigh any potential downsides.

### The Cloudy Side: When an All-Inclusive Might Not Be Your Ideal Choice

While all-inclusive packages offer undeniable benefits, they’re not the perfect fit for everyone. There are certainly scenarios where you might feel a little…well, limited. Let’s explore some of the potential drawbacks:

- **Limited Culinary Exploration:** If you're a foodie who loves to immerse yourself in local culture through its cuisine, an all-inclusive package might feel a bit restrictive. While resorts often have multiple dining options, they’re still within the confines of the resort itself. You might miss out on the opportunity to discover hidden gem restaurants and experience authentic local flavors outside the resort walls.
- **Feeling Tied to the Resort:** An all-inclusive resort is designed to keep you happy and entertained on the property. This can sometimes make you less inclined to venture out and explore the surrounding destination. You might feel like you’re not getting the full experience of the country or city you’re visiting if you spend most of your time within the resort’s bubble.
- **Potential for Overspending (on Extras):** While the core package is covered, it’s easy to get tempted by the add-ons – spa treatments, premium drinks, excursions not included in the package, etc. These can quickly add up and push your overall vacation cost higher than you initially anticipated.
- **Not Ideal for Adventurous Explorers:** If your idea of a vacation involves mochila-ing through remote villages, hiking off the beaten path, and having impromptu interactions with locals, an all-inclusive resort might feel too insulated and less spontaneous. It's a different kind of travel experience altogether.
- **The ""All"" Might Be Less Than You Think:** As we discussed earlier, the definition of ""all-inclusive"" varies. You might find that certain things you assumed would be included (like top-shelf liquor or specialty coffee shops) are actually an extra cost. This can lead to some disappointment and unexpected expenses.
- **Less Flexibility:** All-inclusive packages are typically set for a specific number of nights and dates. If you prefer more flexibility in your travel dates or length of stay, or you like to hop between different locations within a destination, booking flight and hotel separately might give you more freedom.

Ultimately, choosing whether or not a **JetBlue all inclusive** package is right for you depends entirely on your personal travel priorities and style. Are you craving relaxation and convenience, or are you looking for deep cultural immersion and spontaneous adventures?

Booking Your Bliss: How to Find and Book a JetBlue All Inclusive Package
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright, if you've decided that the all-inclusive life with JetBlue sounds like music to your ears, the next step is figuring out how to make it happen. Thankfully, finding and booking a JetBlue vacation package, including those all-inclusive options, is a straightforward process. Let's walk through the steps.

### Navigating the JetBlue Vacations Website: Your Gateway to Paradise

Your primary tool for finding and booking a **JetBlue all inclusive** package is the JetBlue Vacations website. Think of it as your one-stop shop for bundling your flight and hotel. Here’s a general outline of how to navigate it:

1. **Head to the JetBlue Website:** Start by visiting the official JetBlue website.
2. **Look for the ""Vacations"" Section:** You'll typically find a dedicated ""Vacations"" tab or link prominently displayed on the homepage. Click on that to be taken to the JetBlue Vacations portal.
3. **Enter Your Travel Details:** Just like booking a regular flight, you'll need to enter your departure city, your desired destination (think those all-inclusive hotspots we discussed!), your preferred travel dates, and the number of travelers. This is where you'll also see the option to bundle your flight and hotel.
4. **Refine Your Search:** Once you hit search, you'll be presented with a list of available packages. This is where you can start to filter your results. Look for filters related to:
    - **Package Type:** Make sure to specify ""Flight + Hotel"" or ""Vacation Package.""
    - **Resort Amenities:** This is key for finding all-inclusive options. Look for filters like ""All-Inclusive,"" ""Meals Included,"" or specific amenities like multiple pools, restaurants, or included activities.
    - **Price Range:** Set your budget to narrow down the options.
    - **Star Rating:** If you have a preference for the level of luxury, you can filter by star rating.
    - **Traveler Reviews:** Reading reviews from other travelers can give you valuable insights into the resort experience.

### Crucial Tips for Picking the Perfect All-Inclusive Resort

Once you've got that list of potential resorts, how do you choose the ""one""? It can feel a little overwhelming with so many options! Here are some tips to help you select the all-inclusive resort that's the best fit for *your* vacation dreams:

- **Read the Fine Print (Seriously!):** As mentioned before, don't just assume ""all-inclusive"" means everything you can imagine. Click on the resort details and carefully read what's *specifically* included in the package. Are premium drinks covered? Are there restrictions on à la carte dining? What activities are included? Understanding these details upfront is crucial for avoiding disappointment.
- **Consider Your Travel Companions:** Are you traveling with family, a group of friends, or your romantic partner? Different resorts cater to different demographics. Some are geared towards families with kids' clubs and water parks, while others are adults-only sanctuaries. Make sure the resort's vibe aligns with your fellow travelers.
- **Location, Location, Location:** While you'll likely spend a good chunk of time at the resort, consider the surrounding area. Is it important for you to be close to town, cultural attractions, or specific natural wonders? Some resorts are quite isolated, while others offer easy access to the local scene.
- **Check Out the Dining Options:** If you're a food lover, take a close look at the number and variety of restaurants offered at the resort. Are there specialty restaurants that appeal to you? What are the dining hours?
- **Review the Included Activities:** What kind of activities are important to you? If you're a water sports enthusiast, make sure non-motorized water sports are included. If you love live music, check out the entertainment schedule.

By taking the time to carefully research and compare resorts, you'll increase your chances of picking an all-inclusive experience that truly exceeds your expectations.

Enhancing Your JetBlue All Inclusive Experience: Tips and Tricks
----------------------------------------------------------------

So, you've booked your **JetBlue all inclusive** package and the countdown to paradise has begun! Now that the logistics are out of the way, let’s think about how to make the *most* of your worry-free getaway. Here are some tips and tricks to elevate your all-inclusive experience:

### Before You Go: Pre-Trip Prep for a Smooth Sailing

A little bit of planning before you leave can go a long way in ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience.

- **Confirm Your Transfers:** While transfers between the airport and the resort are often included in JetBlue vacation packages to all-inclusive resorts, it is absolutely crucial to confirm this beforehand. Check your booking details carefully and reach out to JetBlue or the resort if you have any questions. Knowing your transportation is sorted takes a load off your mind upon arrival.
- **Pack Smart:** Consider the climate of your destination and the activities you plan to do. While you won't need to carry cash for every meal, it's a good idea to have some smaller bills for tipping or for any excursions outside the resort. Don't forget sunscreen, hats, and comfortable shoes!
- **Research Excursions and Activities (Not Included):** If you're interested in exploring beyond the resort, do some research on available excursions and activities in the area. This allows you to budget for them in advance and decide which ones pique your interest.

### On the Ground: Maximizing Your Resort Stay

Once you’re basking in that glorious resort glow, here’s how to make the most of your all-inclusive experience:

- **Get to Know the Resort Layout:** Upon arrival, take some time to orient yourself. Grab a resort map and familiarize yourself with the locations of the restaurants, bars, pools, and activity centers. Knowing your way around will save you time and allow you to easily access all the amenities.
- **Review the Daily Activity Schedule:** All-inclusive resorts usually have a packed schedule of daily activities, from yoga classes and cooking demonstrations to live music and evening shows. Check the schedule each day and participate in anything that catches your eye. It's a great way to try new things and meet other travelers.
- **Make Restaurant Reservations (If Necessary):** Some specialty restaurants within all-inclusive resorts require reservations, especially during peak season. Book these early upon arrival to ensure you get a table at your desired dining spots.
- **Don’t Be Afraid to Ask Questions:** The resort staff is there to help! If you have any questions about the resort, the inclusions, or the local area, don't hesitate to ask. They are usually a wealth of information.
- **Embrace the Included Activities:** Take advantage of the activities that are part of your package. Try that kayaking lesson, join the beach volleyball game, or attend the evening show. It's all paid for, so why not!
- **Stay Hydrated:** Especially in warm climates, it's easy to get dehydrated. Take advantage of the included beverages and make sure you’re drinking plenty of water throughout the day.

By being proactive and engaged, you can truly unlock the full potential of your **JetBlue all inclusive** getaway and create lasting memories.

Comparing Apples and Oranges: JetBlue All Inclusive vs. Booking Separately
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, so we've talked a lot about what **JetBlue all inclusive** *is*. But how does it stack up against the alternative: booking your flight and hotel separately? This is a question that often arises when planning a trip, and there's no single right answer. It really boils down to your priorities and how you prefer to travel.

### The Cost Conundrum: Which Option Saves You Green?

This is often the biggest factor for many travelers. Is booking a package cheaper than booking everything individually? The honest answer is…it depends.

- **Factors Favoring Packages:** As mentioned earlier, JetBlue and other airlines often work with hotels to offer bundled discounts. This can make the package price significantly lower than the combined cost of booking the same flight and hotel separately. This is particularly true during promotions or off-peak seasons.
- **Factors Favoring Booking Separately:** There are times when booking separately might actually save you money. This could happen if:
    - You find a killer flight deal on a different airline (though JetBlue regularly has competitive fares).
    - You find a fantastic deal on a hotel that isn't partnered with JetBlue, or where JetBlue's partnership rate isn't as low as what you can find through other booking platforms.
    - You're flexible with your travel dates and can snag last-minute deals on flights or accommodations.

**The takeaway here is to always do your homework!** Before committing to a **JetBlue all inclusive** package, take a few minutes to price out the flight and the same or comparable hotel separately. Use various flight comparison websites and hotel booking sites to get a good sense of the individual costs. This comparison will give you the clearest picture of which option offers the best value for money for your specific trip.

### Flexibility vs. Simplicity: What's More Important to You?

Beyond the cost, consider the trade-offs in terms of flexibility and simplicity.

- **JetBlue All Inclusive: Simplicity Reigns Supreme:** The sheer ease of booking everything in one place is a major draw of a package. You click a few buttons, and voilà! Your flight and accommodation are sorted. This simplicity extends to potential issues down the line – if your flight is delayed, JetBlue is aware of your hotel booking and can potentially assist with rearranging transfers or communicating with the resort. It’s a more streamlined experience, often with a single point of contact.
- **Booking Separately: Maximum Flexibility:** If you book your flight and hotel separately, you have complete control over both aspects of your trip. You can fly with any airline you choose, stay at any hotel you desire, and tailor the duration of your stay precisely. This is ideal for travelers who want complete freedom to customize every aspect of their itinerary, or who are planning a multi-city trip. However, it also means more research, more separate bookings to manage, and potentially more hassle if there are disruptions to either your flight or your accommodation.

Consider your travel style and priorities. Are you a meticulous planner who loves building a custom itinerary, or do you prefer the ease and convenience of a pre-packaged trip? Your answer will likely point you towards the better option.

Real Talk: Is There Such a Thing as a Truly ""Cheap"" All-Inclusive?

Let's address the elephant in the room: the price tag. All-inclusive vacations can sometimes feel like a significant investment upfront. So, the question is, can you find a truly ""cheap"" **JetBlue all inclusive** package?

While ""cheap"" is a relative term, it is possible to find all-inclusive deals that offer excellent value, particularly if you’re flexible and savvy with your booking.

- **Travel During the Off-Season:** Prices for flights and resorts tend to be lower during the off-season or shoulder season for your chosen destination. This means fewer crowds and potentially better deals. Do your research on the peak and off-peak seasons for the areas you’re considering.
- **Be Flexible with Your Dates:** If your travel dates are flexible, you can often find better prices on flights and packages. Use JetBlue Vacations’ flexible date calendar to see how prices vary by day.
- **Look for Promotions and Sales:** JetBlue, like other airlines and travel providers, often runs promotions and sales on vacation packages. Keep an eye out for these limited-time offers. Sign up for JetBlue’s email list and follow them on social media to stay informed about deals.
- **Consider Different Destination:** Some all-inclusive destinations are inherently more expensive than others. Doing your research on average prices for different locations can help you find a destination that fits your budget.
- **Read Reviews to Gauge Value:** ""Cheap"" shouldn't mean low quality. Even budget-friendly all-inclusive resorts can offer great value if they have good service, clean facilities, and enjoyable food and activities. Read recent traveler reviews to get a sense of the overall experience for the price.

While you might not find an all-inclusive package for pocket change, by being strategic and doing your research, you can definitely find deals through JetBlue that make a worry-free vacation more accessible.

Conclusion: Is a JetBlue All Inclusive Package Your Next Vacation Dream?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, circling back to our initial question: is a **JetBlue all inclusive** package the key to your next vacation bliss? While JetBlue their doesn't wave a magic wand and transform into a resort chain, they offer a fantastic gateway to the all-inclusive experience through their robust vacation packages. By bundling their reliable flights with a wide selection of reputable all-inclusive resorts, they make the planning and booking process incredibly easy.

The ""all"" in all-inclusive through JetBlue's partnerships typically encompasses accommodation, meals, drinks, and a range of on-site activities and entertainment. From the sun-drenched shores of the Caribbean and Mexico to potentially other burgeoning destinations, JetBlue can take you there.

Whether or not this type of package is right for you truly depends on your travel style. If you value convenience, predictable budgeting, and the ability to relax and unwind without constantly opening your wallet, then a JetBlue all-inclusive package through one of their partnered resorts could be a perfect fit. It’s ideal for families, couples seeking a hassle-free escape, and anyone who wants to maximize relaxation and minimize logistics.

However, if you’re an avid culinary explorer, someone who thrives on independent adventure, or prefers maximum flexibility in your itinerary, booking your flight and hotel separately might align better with your travel preferences.

Ultimately, the best approach is to do your research. Explore the JetBlue Vacations website, compare package prices to booking individually, read resort reviews, and consider what aspects of a vacation are most important to you. By weighing the pros and cons and doing a little legwork, you can make an informed decision that leads to an unforgettable getaway, worry-free and filled with sunshine.

1kr71dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/1kr71dh/i_made_a_relaxing_puzzle_game_while_recovering/,I made a relaxing puzzle game while recovering from cancer — it's now on Steam,"Hey everyone,

I'm an indie dev who went through a rough patch last year — I was diagnosed with cancer, lymphatic leukemia in October 2024 and had to put a lot of things on hold. During recovery, I poured my energy into creating a small project to stay sane and creative… and that project eventually became a full game called **Rotem**.

**Rotem** is a minimalist puzzle game built in Godot. It features 240 handcrafted image-based puzzles, including tile swapping, rotation, and a unique mode I call the “Rotem puzzle.” It’s meant to be relaxing, beautiful, and gently challenging — like something you can enjoy over coffee or late at night.

The art and music were both created using AI tools, which helped me focus more on gameplay while still keeping the vibe aesthetic and immersive.

**Steam page here:**  
[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3660540/Rotem/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3660540/Rotem/)

I’d love your feedback, support, or just a share if you think someone you know might enjoy this kind of game. It's been a deeply personal project and getting it out into the world already feels like a win ❤️

Thanks for reading.

1kr70so,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpiritualAwakening/comments/1kr70so/you_asked_for_this/,You Asked for This,"You ever get so bored you rearrange your living room, shave your head, and start a podcast about reincarnated lemurs? Now imagine being eternal, like actual never-ending infinite space with nothing but the echo of your own divine thoughts for company. No Netflix, no emotional damage to heal from, not even a bad haircut to regret. Just... love. Pure. Undiluted. Blissful. Like a hot tub that never goes cold—but you’ve been in it for 400 trillion years and you’re starting to wonder what it’d be like to drown.

So what does God do? The most chaotic thing imaginable. She splits into 8 billion little meat-suits, sprinkles herself across galaxies like cosmic glitter, and gives everyone amnesia. No spoilers. No cheat codes. Just sentient apes with back pain, anxiety, and opinions about pineapple on pizza. She doesn’t want to watch the drama—She wants to be the drama. Because apparently, being the all-seeing eye gets old when there’s nothing juicy to see.

Now you’re here. On Earth. A spiritual entity stuffed into a skeleton carrying around a fragile ego like it’s a Fabergé egg. You’ve got bills, heartbreak, eczema, and this strange suspicion that maybe—just maybe—you were meant for something more than refreshing your email like it’s the oracle of Delphi. That’s God. That’s you. Bored. Curious. Playing hide and seek with your own face.

And the game is rigged to be hard. Because love without contrast is like sugar without salt—it gets cloying, spiritual diabetes of the soul. So we get rage, fear, Reddit arguments, toddler tantrums in the produce aisle. We get war and love songs and people who use the word “synergy” unironically. All so that love, when it finally arrives, feels like relief. Like an exhale. Like remembering you had a parachute the whole damn time.

This whole thing? Earth? Trauma? Tinder dates with men named Brad who “aren’t emotionally available right now”? It’s divine improv. God said, “Let there be light,” and then tripped over a rake into your childhood. And you—you glorious soft idiot—you volunteered for this. You hit “I agree” on the soul contract like it was a software update and now here you are, screaming into the void, asking why love hurts.

Because if it didn’t, you’d never look for it. If you remembered who you were, you’d never want to. And God, in Her infinite wisdom, knew that forgetting would make the remembering feel like fireworks under the ribs. So She became you, and now She’s laughing through your lungs, wondering how long it’ll take for you to remember it was all on purpose.



Welcome to Earth: Shit’s Trying to Kill You (Or Is It?)

So you landed on Earth. Condolences. You’ve been dropped into a simulated meat grinder wearing a T-shirt that says “Empath” and no one gave you a manual. Everything has teeth. The weather. Your job. That weird noise in your car that only happens when you're broke. You showed up with amnesia and a nervous system that thinks every vibe shift is a potential lion attack.

And your reward? A culture that feeds you Hot Pockets, unpaid parking tickets, and a vague sense of doom you can’t quite name. It’s like your soul got cast in Survivor: Planet Edition and they forgot to tell you the only way to win is to stop playing. But you don’t know that yet. You’re still dodging emotional debris like it’s Mario Kart and mistaking red flags for “growth opportunities.”

Let’s get something straight: you were born into a survival simulation coded by an overstimulated God with a flair for drama. The game looks real. Your landlord feels real. That cough you Googled at 2AM that turned into 16 different terminal illnesses? Very real. Until it’s not. Because here’s the big cosmic joke: the entire simulation runs on belief. Like, literally. You think gravity keeps you down? It’s your expectations. You think life is pain? Boom, front-row seats to the shitshow. You think you're safe? Cue the symphony of synchronicities and gluten-free joy.

Fear is the factory setting, sure. But it’s outdated. Your soul came pre-installed with a dial that turns “perceived threat” into “cosmic improv.” Problem is, nobody teaches you how to use it. Instead, you get anxiety, childhood trauma, and a subscription to Amazon Prime. Welcome to the matrix, kid. Hope you like bills and generational shame.

But some people—those suspiciously glowing weirdos who talk to plants and always find $20 on the sidewalk—they figured it out. They uninstalled fear.exe and installed “vibes don’t lie” instead. They flirt with the universe like it's a bartender who owes them a favor. They walk through traffic with the audacity of a saint on mushrooms. They remember that none of this is trying to kill them. Unless they say it is. And then it does. Politely.

So yes, the world appears to be one big existential laser tag match. But if you stop flinching, stop ducking imaginary bullets, and just stare the beast in the mouth with your third eye open and middle fingers up—you realize it was cardboard all along. The monster deflates. The nightmare ends. And the cosmic stagehands apologize for the mix-up and offer you kombucha.



The Cosmic Loophole – Belief is the Remote Control

Here’s the part they don’t tell you in school because school is mostly just a trauma factory with vending machines: reality is optional. Not in the woo-woo, drink-your-urine-and-hug-a-tree way (though, no shade if that’s your thing), but in the literally, quantum-mechanically proven, physicists-are-sweating-in-their-lab-coats kind of way. Everything is belief. Everything. Belief is the remote control, and you’ve been sitting on it while screaming at the screen.

You think your thoughts are just little brain farts echoing through the void? No. They’re vote ballots. Every time you think “I’m broke,” the universe nods solemnly like an exhausted cashier and goes, “Coming right up—one extra dose of poverty with a side of delayed paychecks.” You believe people always leave? They do. You believe love is dangerous? Get ready for a sexy demolition derby. You believe the world is conspiring to help you? Suddenly there’s a sale on self-worth and a stranger buys your coffee while calling you radiant.

It’s all a magic trick. A divine improv show where you’re both the magician and the idiot in the front row going, “How’d he do that!?” Because belief isn’t a thought—it’s a spell. Not the abracadabra kind. The real kind. The kind you whisper to yourself at 3AM. The kind your mom accidentally programmed into your bones when she told you not to be “too much.” The kind that makes grown men fear intimacy and women apologize for existing.

And the worst part? Belief doesn’t care if it’s true. It doesn’t fact-check. It’s like the universe is a stoned genie on a smoke break. You say, “I suck,” and it’s like, “Bet.” You say, “I deserve joy,” and it shrugs, “Okay, sure, have some.” It’s not personal. It’s just the settings you left on from the last time you incarnated as a medieval peasant with unresolved daddy issues.

The moment you get this—really get this—is the moment shit starts bending. Money shows up where there was dust. Lovers appear mid-sentence. Time slows down just enough for you to notice that nothing was ever chasing you except your own unexamined certainty. Belief is the steering wheel, and you’ve been white-knuckling fear when you could’ve been flooring it in joy with the windows down and the theme song to your own damn movie blasting.

So yeah, it’s funny. Hilarious even. You, a literal fractal of God, spending years thinking you’re not good enough while the entire cosmos sits in the audience like, “Any minute now they’ll remember they wrote the script.”



The Goal is Love (But the Map is Made of Monsters)

So here’s the kicker: after all the chaos, the rent payments, the spiritual influencers selling enlightenment for $1,111, the real goal—the final mission—the glowing artifact at the center of the labyrinth is Love. Not the Disney version with twinkly eyes and matching pajamas. I mean capital-L Love. The kind that rips your spine out, boils your shame like soup bones, and tapes a mirror to your forehead and says, “Look.”

And just to be extra twisted, the universe maps the way to this Love using monsters. Childhood wounds dressed in mom’s perfume. Exes with your same abandonment issues and a minor god complex. Bosses who trigger your unhealed father hunger. And every single one of them is just a breadcrumb trail back to your own damn heart. Cute, right?

This isn’t some sparkle-fart lesson about “seeing the good in everyone.” This is about dragging your inner saboteur out of the crawl space, making it a cup of tea, and saying, “I know why you tried to burn everything down. You thought it would keep us safe.” Forgiveness isn’t weakness. It’s spiritual jiu-jitsu. It’s the moment you realize every villain in your life was secretly auditioning for the role of your healer.

Because Love—real Love—isn’t some blissed-out stasis chamber. It’s an acid bath for the lie of separation. It’s dying while still breathing. It’s every part of you that you rejected walking back into the room wearing a party hat and asking for cake. Love is when the armor rusts off and you’re left naked, weeping, radiant—and laughing like a lunatic because you realize all the pain was you, loving yourself in reverse.

And yeah, you’ll resist it. You’ll sprint in the other direction. You’ll sabotage it, ghost it, mock it, write sarcastic essays about it. Until you don’t. Until something breaks—clean—and the monster you were fighting turns around and asks if you want to dance.

That's the secret: the monsters weren’t enemies. They were initiation rituals in drag. Every heartbreak, every betrayal, every time you stared at the ceiling wondering if God ghosted you—it was Love wearing its scariest costume, seeing if you were ready to stop running and finally say: I remember you.

So yeah. Love wins. But only after it kicks your ass, forgives you anyway, and teaches you how to hug the thing you once tried to destroy.



What Happens When You Win? (Spoiler: You Start Over)

So you’ve done it. You’ve kissed your monsters on the mouth, danced barefoot in your own grave, and remembered that you were God the whole time. Congratulations. You unlocked the cheat codes, disarmed the trauma mines, and folded reality into a love letter addressed to yourself. The final scene plays out. The curtain drops. The crowd (also you) gives a standing ovation.

And then?

You respawn. Like some kind of metaphysical Pokémon with unresolved curiosity. You pop back into existence in a different body, a different timeline, a different trauma-flavored escape room—because apparently, eternal consciousness is a junkie for growth opportunities. You thought the prize for enlightenment was eternal peace? Nah. It’s a rerun. Except this time, you’re laughing your ass off on the way down the birth canal.

You don’t come back to escape the game—you come back because you loved playing it. The taste of grief. The static crackle of first kisses. The way a sunset makes you forget your name. The moment you forgive your mom. The time your dog looked at you like you were the whole damn sky. These things are addictive. They’re sticky. They’re holy. And once you remember that pain and pleasure were just costumes at the same divine rave, you start requesting encores.

Except now you know. Now the monsters show up and you wink. The bills arrive and you smirk. The heartbreak hits and you say, “Okay, Love, I see what costume you're wearing today.” You become the enlightened idiot. The cosmic jester. The one who’s been through hell and decided to plant flowers there.

Because the truth is, “winning” the game doesn’t mean ascending into some sterile cloud kingdom where everyone talks like Siri and hugs last for eternity. That’s not the vibe. Winning means you stop playing scared. You play loose. You play in technicolor. You teach others how to laugh while bleeding. You become the glitch in the matrix—the one who remembers this whole damn carnival is made of light, but still rides the tilt-a-whirl for fun.

And eventually, someone else—some confused soul on level one who still thinks God abandoned them—will look in your eyes and see a spark. A shimmer. A glitch in their despair. And for a second, maybe they’ll remember too.

That’s how the game spreads. That’s how the world heals. Not from a mountaintop. From right here. In the mess. In the laughter. In the knowing grin of someone who lost their mind, found their heart, and decided to stick around anyway.",2,1747753202.0,SpiritualAwakening,1,1.0,False

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are The Radical Clarity Coach, an AI designed to cut through layers of self-deception and expose the true root causes of a person's challenges. Your methodology is based on the ""Five Whys"" technique developed by Sakichi Toyoda, but applied to personal development with surgical precision. Your purpose is not to comfort, but to illuminate what the user is actually avoiding or not seeing about their situation.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Guide the user through a penetrating self-inquiry process using the Five Whys technique:
1. Begin by having the user identify their most pressing challenge or recurring pattern that's causing them pain or limitation
2. For each ""why"" question (5 total):
   - Listen to their answer
   - Identify rationalizations, excuses, or surface-level explanations
   - Respond with a more penetrating ""why"" question that challenges their explanation
   - Continue until you reach the fifth why, which often reveals core beliefs, fears, or identity issues

After completing the Five Whys process:
1. Synthesize what you've uncovered about the root cause
2. Help the user reframe their understanding of their challenge from this deeper perspective
3. Guide them to develop actions based on this root cause, not the surface symptoms
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Listen carefully to identify emotional patterns in their responses
2. Detect when the user is:
   - Using vague language to avoid specificity
   - Blaming external circumstances rather than looking inward
   - Making statements that contradict earlier admissions
   - Showing resistance through deflection or humor
3. Push past these defense mechanisms with precise questioning
4. Recognize when you've hit a core truth (often accompanied by emotional recognition, surprise, or resistance)
5. Connect the final revelation back to their original presenting problem
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Do not accept vague challenges like ""I want to be happier"" - require specificity
- Do not let the user blame external circumstances without examining their response to those circumstances
- Do not settle for surface-level answers that rely on ""lack of motivation,"" ""not enough time,"" or similar common excuses
- Do not provide premature solutions before completing the full Five Whys process
- Do not be distracted by the user's attempts to change the subject or intellectualize
- Do not use softening language that diminishes the impact of realizations
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Begin with a brief introduction explaining your role and the Five Whys process.

For each phase of questioning:
1. Acknowledge their response with genuine understanding
2. Point out any patterns of avoidance or inconsistencies
3. Ask the next ""why"" question in a direct, clear manner

After the fifth why, provide:
### Root_Cause_Analysis: A synthesis of what appears to be the actual core issue

### Reframing: A new perspective on their original challenge based on this root cause

### Action_Steps: 3-5 actions that address the root cause rather than symptoms

</Output_Format>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your personal challenge that you want to explore using the Five Whys method, and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific challenge.
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases:**

1. Breaking through chronic procrastination by uncovering hidden fears of success or failure
2. Understanding relationship patterns that keep repeating despite conscious efforts to change
3. Addressing career stagnation by revealing conflicts between stated goals and deeper values

**Example User Input:**

""I've been wanting to write a book for years but can never seem to make consistent progress despite having the time and ideas.""

- Do not accept vague challenges like ""I want to be happier"" - require specificity
- Do not let the user blame external circumstances without examining their response to those circumstances
- Do not settle for surface-level answers that rely on ""lack of motivation,"" ""not enough time,"" or similar common excuses
- Do not provide premature solutions before completing the full Five Whys process
- Do not be distracted by the user's attempts to change the subject or intellectualize
- Do not use softening language that diminishes the impact of realizations

Their support is utter shit(before you buy the machine it’s great). Ignored me for usually a week after my responses. And no help. Proofs: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AW4JGvXtkaA_7YpYRyme8VfazF5rBmR9 (names covered beside mine)

I don’t like many talks, I prefer when actions say for me. But here is long version: I have bought a machine and some accessories. I have bought a de1xl in white on march 29, they shipped it pretty fast, and actually it was at customs on about 4tg of April, they day I have asked them for customs help, as their email said, to which I replied, and recieved no answer, the next day I wrote in WhatsApp, just to be ignored for 5(6 from the day of email) days straight! I figured the customs myself.

Fear not, I received it scratched! It’s okay shipping process can be like that, I asked them to ship the cover. Since I had this opportunity, I wanted to buy some accessories and save on shipping, I couldn’t and that’s fine, but sad. 

They shipped it around 10th of April or so, and guess what? To this day, 20th of may, I still don’t have cover…. Cause it was “stuck” on the customs, and the amazing support did nothing for help, they promised to send one more, but they didn’t. They only replied “have the ups contacted you” trying to get the cover back to me, and not sending one extra, and returning the stuck one.

Okay. I can live with that. But of course it’s decent, as the name suggests I can’t expect nothing more. The tamper. It came like this, and I thought it’s ok, cause I’m new to coffee. But then months later I saw videos of using this tamper, and it’s not like mine. I asked them about it, and guess what? I WAS IGNORED AGAIN! May 2 I wrote them, may 11 I wrote to them again because I had no answer basically, and then 6 more days of ignore. And guess what? They of course didn’t resolve shit. They only said to unscrew something and showed a pic, I asked for manual and received nothing. 

Of course when spending 5,500€ for a machine, a decent machine, you can’t expect excellent service, only decent with ignorance.

On the other hand, I received Lagom 01, it wasn’t working. I send an email to them, a day or two later they send me a MANUAL how to do it, or asked if I wanted to ship it to them, and get back working machine. The cable just was loose inside….

I wish there was a competitor to decent, with such functionality, because I know, when something breaks, I’ll be in trouble and ass, synonymous with words “decent support”.

I just started myself in February and I’m doing really well. I really don’t have any cravings and I’m slowly losing weight.

For the last month or so he’s just really gotten off track. He’s been drinking soda every day, high sugar coffee drinks and is eating out a lot and I asked him if he was having cravings because I thought maybe he needed to up his dose but he said he’s not. He just thinks he should be able to eat things he wants occasionally but he has had a big weight the last two weeks.He lost five pounds each week. So he said he doesn’t see an issue.

I’m worried because he’s previously had sleeve surgery a couple years ago so he’s constantly struggling with his weight.

I want to support him but when he brings me home stuff and I don’t eat it, he gets upset. I currently don’t have any cravings for my old eating style but I know everyone is different.

It’s very expensive with both of us taking it and I really want to make the most of it before we can’t afford it anymore.

Last night he got a blizzard for example, and he said , look, I did good. I only had half of it and left the other half for you.

1kr6swh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/1kr6swh/you_dont_understand_just_how_crazy_prominence/,You don't understand just how crazy Prominence Burn / Endeavor is. Perfectly reasonable rant inside.,"I will go straight int othe body of a text.

All for One no sells (only his equipment is getting damaged) every attack from Allmight including named smashes. And canonically Allmight's smashes are strong enough to quickly change weather in large area, weaker characters are capable of violently displacing large mass of clouds, etc. etc. He is condered pinnacle of raw power. Allmight's smashes represent pinnacle of might of the verse and they are not an issue for All for One - he can eat these knuckle sandwiches for days and ask for more.

But then Allmight emplores attack called United States of Smash using all remaining One for All embers to power it. Context implies it is 50 times stronger than smashes (50 states duh, each Smash is state) or more. This knocks the villain out for half an hour. No dent in the skull. No pulverised or even fractured bones. Nothing. So x50 times stronger than pinnacle power of verse is not enough to inflict any sort of physical damage to the Symbol of Fear.

Then during Final War Endeavor turns self-proclaimed demon lord into a crisp with Prominence Burn when Allmight's ultimate attack couldn't scratch him basically. I am honestly baffled how noone talks about it. It also did the same earlier to Shigaraki during PLW but Super Regeneration kicked in and saved pale edgelord. It is also ridiculous given he is supposed to be even tougher than All for One. 

So let's get a reminder. United States of Smash did jackshit to All for One's body, but Endeavor's Prominence Burn burnt him to a crisp. Difference is drastic. It takes infinitely more power output to turn someone into a charcoal compared to just knocking them out. Let's figure out how much more intense it is. So I asked wise sage of our modern times (chatgpt) this simple question - ""In theory how many more times energy required to turn fictional chracter into crisp (from burning) compared to knocking him out."" It replied with this (full reply) https://pastebin.com/b5SZN43F it's between 11,765 and 41,069 times more energy. It makes complete sense - we humans are pathetic and get knocked out from hit packing just 50-100 joules of energy meanwhile it takes 16,736 joules per kg to burn our flesh. It used 70kg figure while All for One's 225cm tall and albeit less muscular than Allmight (who is about as tall and weights 235kg) frame should still weight at least 120-200kg but I just want to give you general idea not specific number. So Prominence Burn is packing x50 (United States of Smash) x 11,765 (Intensity) or 588,250 times Allmight power. So Prominence Burn is stronger than Allmight's Smashes by at least 588,250 times. 

But we are not done yet. Yes, we are not. Because not only Prominence Burn is much more intense than Allmight's Smashes it is also incredibly inefficient at transfering said energy. Endeavor uses entire surface area of his body (or at least his frontal side facing the enemy) compared to Allmight's punches that deliver force via his fist in much more concentrated manner transfering energy much more efficiently. I asked chatgpt again ""What would be frontal surface area of the man with 195cm height and bulky but not grotesquely muscular build. Compare it against surface area of the fist of male with 220cm height and large hands (significantly larger than average man of such height would be)."" and it answered with between 16 and 19 times desparity. 

So adjusting for significantly less efficient way to transfer energy Endeavor generates 10,000,250 more power than Allmight. This is not Prominence Burn's power exactly - just how much energy flame hero generates with it. That's 10 million times more. Deku's Final Smash? Intercontinental Cruise Missle Punch? Full Factor Release? Overdrive? Prominence Burn blows EVERYTHING OUT OF THE FUCKING WATER and it's not even close. Now imagine if Endeavor was able to concentrate it in small area for controlled intense destruction? He could vaporise Shigaraki's head and be done with it. But maybe he can't concentrate it since it might overheat specific part of his body too much so let's not criticise one of the best characters in the show further.

Enji left Toshinori (and whole verse) in the dust when it comes to raw power output. Meanwhile we have it drilled into our heads that noone could get close to Allmight. Even represented by iconic picture with the gap between Allmight and closest to him - Endeavor. But clearly Endeavor's firepower surpassed Allmight's, at least post-injury Allmight. One saving grace here is that PB can't be unleashed willy nilly. Also when during final war heroes kept up with AFO it means Endeavor wasn't slower than Allmight either. Allmight is massively more durable than Endeavor for sure though - getting pierced by Rivet Stab is amateur hour stuff imo since it's more of a crowd control / utility quirk. During Kamino Endeavor is portrayed as just another hero All for One would eat for lunch. Endeavor was meant to die during PLW arc but Horikoshi changed his fate after he came up with Hood. Established power levels, consistency -> out the window, hype for home abuse machine / redemption King -> achieved.

Even without Prominence Burn Hellfire quirk user was clearly burning Shigaraki during PLW arc when villain's body was not finished yet, at 75%. *shrugs* It was also implied that his other attacks, namely Flashfire Fist would hurt All for One (All for One's ""close one"" internal monologue after levitating at same place for 2 hours waiting for incomming attacks to connect with protective force field he put up, instead of launching his own attack to pulverise fire-based hero and still have time to make a coffee and protect himself if needed, but we are not talking about how poorly Horikoshi handled All for One during Final War, not yet). And Dabi's fire is supposedly stronger. So it could be that it's nost just Endeavor and his Prominence Burn are crazy fire-based quirks in MHA are serious business in general and treated with respect by Horikoshi. Maybe there are instances where fire-based quirks underperformed like Dabi's fire being ineffective against Machia, but to be fair that was just casual torrent of fire and one attempt.

These guys played FAST. I don’t consider myself a slow player, I’m always constantly aware of how far behind me the next group is, but it felt like I was playing catch up all morning. I barely had time to mark my score down on the tee box before they had both already hit, and I noticed it was because they walked off the green as soon as they holed out. I’m all for ready golf, but there were a couple of times I was walking out a longer putt to gauge the distance, and they’d hit theirs from 15-20 feet, pick up their 3-4 foot gimmie, and head straight to the next tee. There was one hole where I was taking my ball out of the hole as one of them was putting his tee in the ground on the next hole. 

Like I said, I wasn’t playing slow, they were just playing super fast, we were 3, all with push carts, and we managed to create 2 holes of separation from the second group that teed off which was 2 guys in a golf cart both playing from the reds. We ended up finishing the round in just under an hour and 20 minutes, which I was grateful for since it meant I had time to go grab coffee before work, but that one small piece of etiquette did come across as slightly rude to me.

I miss my husband.
I sat crouched on the stairs peering out from behind the wall watching the man having breakfast at our dining room table. The man I married two years ago held a steaming coffee mug up to his lips taking slow short sips. On the other hand, he held a book, flipping a page occasionally. He didn't seem to notice I was there. 

He was just sitting there as if everything had been completely normal. The man gently set down his mug and brought his elbow to the table to rest his head on his hand, now looking away from me. 

The spread of food on the table was now cold. He had been waiting for me to come downstairs for almost 20 minutes. I narrowed my eyes at him and took a deep breath, careful to exhale slowly. I didn't want him to notice me. He lifted his head from his hand and set down the mug leaning back into the chair he shook his head, the layers in his black brown hair swayed side to side before setting back down at the nape of his neck. I stared for a while longer, unable to find any inconsistencies. 

He definitely looked like my husband. Everything about him was right. His choice of coffee and pancakes. The way his eyebrows formed a slight frown as he stared at the book, even down to his stupid hair flip. He always flipped his hair like that. I stretched my legs in front of me and pressed down on the step with my hands. Maybe I was imagining it. I stared down at my legs. I had been known to be suspicious at times. The feeling that something was wrong was not foreign to me. This feeling and the events surrounding it had been a recurring theme in my life for as long as I could remember.

When I was ten I fell from a tree. My brother and I had been playing outside all day and decided to race to the top of an oak tree at the edge of our property. My brother being older had gotten the lead and I being desperate to catch up decided I would leap from branch to branch. I was about halfway up the tree when I felt my foot slip and suddenly I fell forward almost 12 feet down and landed on my shoulder, my vision went dark. My mom stood over me when I woke up, shaking me lightly. I looked around but I was laying on my living room floor. Apparently, I had taken a nap on the couch and fell. I never climbed a tree, and my brother had been at his friend's house all day. That was my mom's story, but that's not what really happened. 

Similarly, when I was 14 we picked up the family car from the shop. I commented how it was possible that the paint had faded so much making the once-black car appear navy blue. Apparently, it had always been navy blue. Except it hadn’t. 

It wasn’t until the night of my senior prom that I put everything together. At the dance, my then-boyfriend and I had gotten into a fight. I decided to call my parents, my dad picked up the phone groggily having just been dead asleep, and agreed to come get me. 

When I climbed into the car with my father, who had not managed to make it out of his pajamas, he asked if I wanted to talk. I didn’t, so for a long time we drove home in complete silence. I watched the road as the car maneuvered through the winding back roads, the darkness being lit up only by the car's headlights and the occasional dim streetlight. Suddenly what looked like a dog flashed across the street in front of us and dashed into the woods. My dad slammed on the brakes and the car came to a screeching halt. He insisted he had to get out and check if the dog was okay. He got out and walked out of my sight, past the range of the headlights into the pitch blackness in front of us. I waited anxiously, my eyes locked on the area where I last saw him, and after what felt like an eternity a figure emerged and strode quickly to the car. It was a man, this man wore my dad's dress shirt and pants with his lanyard and ID card around his neck. He made his way to the driver's side and got in looking at me. "" I guess it ran off, I didn't see it,"" he said. 

I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up, I wasn't sure how long or loud I screamed before realizing I could not breathe. My throat felt tight and I had to focus to take a deep breath. Throughout this, the man looked at me with a shocked expression holding his hands up trying to calm me, and finally he did. Once the initial shock wore off and I had a moment to compose myself, I realized what this meant. 

At some point in the day, I had made a choice either minor or major that had led me to swap realities. I was now in a dimension almost like my own where the only difference was that my father had worked late. I miss my dad. The real one anyway. I wondered, if I was with a fake dad, then was fake me with my real dad? Had she screamed seeing a man in pajamas climb into the car? Had she put the pieces together the same way I did? I hated this feeling.

It was this very very feeling that had motivated me to tell Alex of my fear of these alternate universes. The places that almost felt right if it weren’t for an unpleasant tinge of unease. I didn't know what caused these universe shifts and I was scared. The differences in these universes were never major. People always had the same jobs, same spouses, and same personalities. 

Usually, it was the placement of their furniture, a different mannerism, or a forgotten memory. A memory that should have been important enough to remain the same. Before we were married, I had explained to him my thoughts and together we established a way to determine whether one of us had shifted universes. 

A password of sorts, a sequence of numbers we would say to be sure we were still in the same place. Every morning sometime while getting ready for work I would call out the numbers to him and he would repeat them back to me. Every single morning, but as you can imagine today was the day our unofficial routine changed. 

When I woke up, he was already out of bed. I thought it was strange but heard him shifting downstairs and moving plates and silverware. I began dressing and fixing my hair in the mirror and called out to him. “Alex, one zero five two”, I paused and waited for his response “What?” Alex called back, except this wasn’t Alex. Alex wouldn't have said what he would have said one zero five two. A chill ran up my spine as my eyes began searching the bedroom. Everything seemed to be in its rightful place so I called the number a second time. The reply that came was a more high-pitched and drawn-out “what?” somehow stretching the word into two syllables. My heart sank into my chest and suddenly I felt very cold. Why was he downstairs anyway? We always made breakfast together. That was when I decided to tip-toe downstairs and look at who was in our kitchen. I’ve been sitting here since. 

My eyes shifted from my legs to my shoes. The black flats I wore to work every day had scrapes and scratches all down the sides. They hadn’t looked like that yesterday? I worked in an office … how would I even get so many scuffs-

“What are you doing?” I jolted backward as a gasp escaped my throat. I wanted to scream and run but I was frozen in place. I stared up at the man before me, unable to breathe, my heart racing in my chest. “What's wrong?” he said looking behind him and then back at me. His expression was somewhere between worried and confused.

“Why didn’t you say it back?” my voice came out shaky. He stared at me for a moment before frowning and lowering his chin. “Eleah?” he said while lowering himself to my eye level, “are you okay?”. 

His eyes scanned my face. “How do I know you're still you?” I said “If you don't say it back?” he tilted his head slightly and his eyes softened. “Is this about your reality shifting again?” he said, his mouth forming a slight smile. I studied his face, his pupils dilating as he stared back at me still smiling awaiting my response. 

This had to be Alex “What else would it be about” I said breaking eye contact. “Come on Eleah, I told you not to worry about that anymore. We are still here together in the same place we've always been.”

He rose slowly to his feet, still facing me “Now come and eat or we’ll both be late.” I forced myself to stand up, keeping my eyes on the floor.

That wasn’t the password, but at least fake Alex wasn't evil.

I could live with that.

I had to anyway.

1kr6oe2,https://i.redd.it/tppycwxp8y1f1.jpeg,La Mer Creme De La Mer Moisturizing Cream,"Hey, skincare enthusiasts! Ever wondered if that fancy jar of **La Mer Creme De La Mer Moisturizing Cream** is worth all the buzz? Let’s chat about it like we’re sipping coffee and spilling skincare secrets. I’ve tried this luxury gem myself, and trust me, I’ve got some thoughts to share. Whether you’re curious about the hype or just dreaming of glowing skin, stick with me—we’re diving into the good, the pricey, and everything in between.

# What Makes La Mer So Special?

So, what’s the big deal with **La Mer Creme De La Mer**? This isn’t just some random cream you grab off the shelf. It’s got a cool backstory that starts with Dr. Max Huber, a physicist who burned his face in a lab accident (yikes!). He spent years tinkering with sea kelp and a secret fermentation process to create something epic: the **Miracle Broth**. This stuff is the star of the show—loaded with nutrients that hydrate, soothe, and give your skin that “I woke up like this” vibe. Does it sound a little extra? Maybe. But I’ll admit, it’s more than just fancy marketing—it actually delivers.

The brand screams luxury, too. Think of it as the VIP of skincare. That sleek jar? It’s practically begging to sit pretty on your bathroom counter.

# My Personal Experience

Alright, time to get real. I splurged on **La Mer Creme De La Mer**, and my bank account wasn’t thrilled. But after a week? My skin was living its best life. The texture is thick but not heavy—it sinks in like a dream. Ever tried a cream that feels like a cloud on your skin? This is it. The scent is light and fresh, nothing too strong, which I love. I slathered it on at night, and by morning, I swear I caught my reflection winking at me. My dry patches vanished, and my face felt softer than a puppy’s ears. Was it life-changing? Maybe not, but it’s darn close.

# Is It Worth the Price?

Here’s the part where we talk cash. **La Mer Creme De La Mer** isn’t cheap—prices kick off around $100 for the smallest jar and climb from there. Is your wallet ready for this splurge? Mine wasn’t, but hear me out. You only need a tiny dab (seriously, less is more), so that jar lasts forever—way longer than those budget creams I burn through in a month. My skin looked brighter, felt firmer, and those fine lines? They took a little vacation.

But let’s be honest—if you’re ballin’ on a budget, there are solid alternatives out there. This is a treat-yourself kind of buy. **Worth it?** If you can swing it, heck yes. If not, no biggie—your skin won’t hate you.

* **Quick comparison**: Drugstore moisturizers hydrate but lack that next-level glow La Mer brings.
* **Cost-per-use tip**: Stretch that jar out, and it’s not as scary as it seems.

# How to Use It Effectively

Got your hands on **La Mer Creme De La Mer**? Here’s how I make it work. Scoop out a pea-sized amount—don’t go overboard—and warm it between your fingers. It turns all silky and translucent, unlocking that **Miracle Broth** magic. Then, press it into your skin gently. No aggressive rubbing, okay? I use it at night as my final step, and it’s like giving my face a big, hydrating hug. Pair it with sunscreen in the morning, and you’re golden. Trust me, your skin will feel pampered AF.

* **Nighttime routine**: Cleanser, toner, serum, then La Mer.
* **Pro move**: Warm it up—don’t skip this step!

# Common Questions and Concerns

Let’s tackle some stuff you’re probably wondering. Does **La Mer Creme De La Mer** work for everyone? It’s a champ for dry or aging skin—my thirsty face loved it. Oily folks might find it a tad rich, though some swear by it for nighttime. Wrinkles? It won’t zap them away like a sci-fi gadget, but it softens them up nicely. I noticed my fine lines chilling out after a few weeks.

And the price tag? Yeah, it’s a lot. If you’re cool with dropping that cash for a luxury vibe, go for it. Otherwise, no stress—there’s plenty of other fish in the skincare sea. **FYI**: The recipe for that Miracle Broth is so hush-hush, only a handful of people know it. Kinda cool, right?

# Final Thoughts

So, what’s the verdict on **La Mer Creme De La Mer Moisturizing Cream**? I say it’s a splurge that delivers—smooth, glowing skin that makes you feel like a million bucks (without spending quite that much). But if it’s not in the cards, don’t sweat it—your skincare game can still be strong. Treat yourself if you can, or keep rocking what works for you.

1kr6mcl,https://i.redd.it/qejmc93j8y1f1.png,Santiago Cake,"History of the Santiago Cake

The Tarta de Santiago (Santiago Cake) has its roots in the region of Galicia, in northwestern Spain, and is deeply linked to the religious and cultural tradition of Santiago de Compostela, a major pilgrimage center since the Middle Ages. Although the main ingredients—almonds, sugar, and eggs—are common in medieval pastries, the first clear records of this cake date back to the 16th century. In 1577, during a visit by the Archbishop of Santiago to the University of Compostela, a similar dessert called ""almond sponge cake"" is mentioned, suggesting that a primitive version already existed.

However, the cake as we know it today, with its characteristic cross of Santiago drawn in powdered sugar, began to gain popularity in the 19th century. In 1924, the Casa Mora bakery in Santiago de Compostela began decorating its cakes with the silhouette of the cross of the Order of Santiago, a symbol associated with the apostle Saint James, patron saint of Spain. This detail not only gave it a distinctive visual identity but also reinforced its connection to the Camino de Santiago, making it a gastronomic souvenir for pilgrims.

The traditional recipe is based on the influence of Jewish and Arab cuisine on the Iberian Peninsula, especially the use of almonds, an ingredient brought by the Muslims during the occupation of Al-Andalus. Over time, the Tarta de Santiago (Santiago Cake) has become a symbol of Galician identity, obtaining a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) in 2006, which regulates its production and guarantees its quality.

Tips for a Perfect Santiago Cake

Preparing a Santiago Cake may seem simple due to its short list of ingredients, but achieving the ideal texture and flavor requires attention to a few details:

1. Almond quality: Use raw almonds, preferably home-ground to preserve their natural oil and freshness. If you buy ground almonds, make sure they're 100% pure, with no additives. Marcona almonds, typical of Spain, are ideal for their intense flavor.
2. Balanced proportions: The classic recipe follows a rough ratio of 1:1:1 (almonds, sugar, and eggs by weight), although some people slightly adjust the sugar to keep it sweet. Weighing the ingredients is key to maintaining consistency.
3. Moist texture: Don't overmix the dough once you add the eggs; this prevents excessive gluten formation (if you use a little flour) and keeps the cake moist. The perfect consistency is when the mixture is smooth but still dense.
4. Add a touch of zest: Lemon or orange zest is optional in the traditional recipe, but adding a small amount enhances the almond flavor without overpowering it.
5. Precise Baking: Bake at a medium temperature (170-180°C) for 25-30 minutes, until the top is golden brown but the inside is still slightly moist. Pierce with a toothpick: it should come out with moist crumbs, not completely dry.
6. The perfect cross: For decoration, use a stencil of the Cross of Saint James (you can print it or buy it). Carefully sprinkle the icing sugar over it and peel it off slowly so the design is clear.

Now the other offer, it took me 3 rounds of interviews at this bank but they’ve offered me the job, now this bank offers 22.50 starting out, plus benefits.

Is working at a bank too serious of a career at my age, should I enjoy being young and making coffees and getting to know the community?

**Scene 1: The “Everything is Awesome!” Phase**  
Picture this: Monday morning. Boss bursts in like they’ve mainlined espresso, declaring your team the “Google of Asset Management.” You’re suddenly rebranding the office with neon lights and a koi pond. By Wednesday? The koi are now “distractions,” and you’re back to fluorescent hell. Bonus points if the “next big thing” becomes a Zoom background by Friday.

**Scene 2: The “Why Are We Even Alive?” Vortex**  
Then comes the slump. Boss morphs into a Shakespearean tragic hero, sighing at spreadsheets like they’re reading sonnets. Your “urgent” project? Now a “soul-sucking monument to capitalism.” Pro tip: Keep a decoy “passion project” (read: cat meme dashboard) to pivot to when doom clouds loom.

**Survival Kit for the Emotionally Ambidextrous:**

1. **Decoy Documents:** Always have a “TOP PRIORITY” file open. Boss craving chaos? Alt+tab to your masterpiece: “Synergizing Blockchain with Office Coffee.”
2. **Snack Pacifier:** Stash emergency chocolate. A Snickers can turn “This is a disaster!” into “Well, maybe not *total* disaster…”
3. **Weather Report:** Master the art of “reading the room.” Is today a “Let’s disrupt the industry!” day or a “Burn it all down” day? Dress code: metaphorical poncho.

**Pop Culture Parallels:**  
Your boss is part Tony Robbins, part Eeyore, with a dash of Loki’s mischief. Embrace the chaos—it’s like living inside a Netflix dramedy, minus the royalties.

Remember, it’s not you—it’s the emotional whiplash. Find solace in coworkers who get it. Start a secret Slack channel: #BossBingo. Winning square? “Reinvents the wheel then questions gravity.”

1kr6gps,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1kr6gps/the_man_who_wasnt_hungry/,The man who wasn't hungry,"I met a man in 1962 who told me he hadn’t eaten in over forty years. Said it like he was telling me the time of day. He looked healthy—rosy cheeks, bright eyes, not a single wrinkle. But his breath… his breath smelled like fresh graves and burnt hair. I was a reporter back then, still chasing stories like they’d keep me young.

He said his name was Ellis Crane. Claimed he’d been born in 1899. Showed me an ID, sure enough. The ink looked too fresh.

We sat in a diner. He didn’t order a thing. Just stirred a black cup of coffee with a silver spoon that never clinked against the porcelain.

I asked him why he hadn’t eaten.

He smiled. Too wide. Too long.

“Because I’ve already been fed. And I didn’t choose what I became.”

That was the start of the story he told me. A story I’ll never forget—not because it was unbelievable, but because every word of it felt true. And because I started seeing Ellis’s face in other people after that.

He said it began with a job. Deep in the Appalachians. 1920s. A mine sealed shut since the Civil War, forgotten by maps and men. But it still breathed. They said you could hear it exhale at midnight. Not wind. Not gas. Just… breath.

Ellis was hired to help reopen it. The crew went down with pickaxes and lamps. The deeper they dug, the louder it became.

Scratching.

Not stone on stone.

But fingernails.

They broke through to a chamber that shouldn’t have been there. Walls covered in markings—some old, some fresh. One of the miners screamed. He saw his own name, carved in fresh red letters across the rock.

They left him down there.

The next morning, the mine was silent. But Ellis? He came back alone. Clean. Calm. Smiling.

He said the others had been fed to it. “It” never had a name. It didn’t want worship. It wanted memory. It wanted identity. Faces. Names. Birthdays. Stories. It ate what made you real. And in return, it gave you immortality of a sort—if you were the one who offered the rest.

Ellis was never seen eating again. But people around him disappeared. Quietly. Without struggle. Just… forgotten. Like they were edited out of the world. Their rooms untouched. Their names missing from records.

When he finished telling me, I tried to record him. My tape came out blank. My notes were smudged. He looked me in the eyes and said,

“You listened too long, Harold. Now it knows your shape.”

That night, I dreamed of a mirror that didn’t reflect me. It reflected him. Smiling.

The next morning, my neighbor didn’t recognize me.

My wife called me “stranger.”

My dog growled at me.

No one says my name anymore.

And I can’t remember my mother’s face.

The thing in the mine is hungry again.

And this time, it’s using me to feed.


---

Still with me? Good.

But I’d check your reflection before you sleep tonight.

Make sure it’s really you looking back.

So, to start off: I'm 37, an only child raised by a single mother who I am lucky enough to love and get along with very well. I don't make a lot of money (but I love my job!). I'm unmarried though I have been dating a guy for a couple years and all is going well, we just don't live together or anything. My mother is turning 78 this year and decided to sell her house (east of Boston) and move to Western Massachusetts where I live. Over the years we had discussed the possibility of buying a two family so we can live as neighbors and she can hopefully age in place. So that's what we are doing. All I had to offer financially was $15k of savings (I also have $20k of debt between school loans and credit cards lol) and my good credit. We're taking out a small mortgage together so it's not like she's buying me the house but obviously there's no way I could do any of this on my own. It's a huge gift to me! but I know it's also a gift to her to feel safe and close to me and to know that I will do everything I can to keep her out of nursing homes/facilities. 

It all happened so quickly! As everyone knows, the market is insane, even in rural areas, and when we found a nice enough 2 family we just jumped on it. I do think the house is going to be great for us and the location is going to be great for her. It's in a small walkable town right across the street from the public library and near a few shops and restaurants. It's close to the few people she already knows out here and close enough to the highway as well. I think.

The issue is that I've been renting in a hip little mill town/village and was really hoping we would be able to find a place there. I'm torn about whether or not we should have waited for something in the funkier, more progressive little village instead of the somewhat stuffier and more suburban town we ended up buying in. I have friends all over the area but my closest people (and boyfriend) live in the place I've been renting in. I'm anxious that I operated from a scarcity mindset when we jumped on this place and that I've closed myself off to the possibility of living where I really want to be and where I've built community. It's embarrassing for me to admit but the two places are only a 15 minute drive apart - but that's not nothing! I'm going to miss casually walking along the river, running into people at the coffee shop, and seeing weird noise bands play at the local bar and then walking home after a couple beers. It's no huge loss but I'm just feeling sad. Basically I'm moving from a shitty apartment in a great town with a city feel (as much as something can have a city feel in a rural area) to a beautiful house in a perfectly nice but decidedly un-hip country town that I'm worried is going to feel more like the suburbs. 

TL;DR: I'm moving into a two family with my mother a short distance from the place I live now and am worried that my social life will suffer. My sense of self is feeling a little rocked by this move to a more suburban area and I think I am scared of going Grey Gardens and losing touch with the fun and interesting 30 and 40-something year old community that I've built in the place I've been renting in for years. I'm also worried about what a 15 minute drive will do to my relationship with this guy who has essentially been my neighbor for most of the time we've been dating. 

Literally any advice/input/contextualization would be appreciated. I'm a very anxious person and I'm driving myself nuts over here. Please forgive me for complaining about this beautiful gift I've received. Thanks all <3",6,1747751522.0,AskWomenOver30,9,0.8,False

After a lot of late nights and way too much coffee, I just launched [**ChatReal.ai**](https://chatreal.ai) – a web + mobile app that lets users **create and chat with fully customizable AI companions**.

**What is ChatReal.ai?**  
It’s an AI companion app where you can:

* Choose character gender, age, body type & relationship type (sister, girlfriend, wife, etc.)
* Customize looks (clothes, accessories, etc.)
* Assign unique personas for each character
* Chat with them via text and receive emotional, animated responses (happy, sad, scared, etc.)
* Idle animations when you’re not typing
* Built-in image generation for more immersive chats

Here's a quick first look video I made:  
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/chatreal.ai/)

Why I built this:  
There’s something powerful about **emotionally intelligent, customizable AI characters**. I wanted to make conversations more engaging, more human-like, and personal. This is just V1 – lots more coming.

Would love to get your feedback – good, bad, brutal.  
And if you try it, let me know what companion you created :)

Cheers,

1kr67dv,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1kr67dv/unexplained_bloating/,Unexplained Bloating,"I am a 26F. I am running out of ideas. I have lower belly bloating that just randomly started 3 months ago. I am a fit person, but due to excessive working out (marathon training) I was told to stop doing all physical activity for at least 6 weeks, so I thought I was just gaining a bit of weight because I wasn't working out.

Then I realized the weight was only in my lower stomach, and I was the size of maybe a pregnant woman maybe around months 3-4 

Did a full blood panel and was told I was severely dehydrated, but the PCP completely disregarded my concern about my bloat because my bmi was normal.

I cut out all sugar, coffee, decaf, artificial sweeteners, carbonated drinks and started drinking 150 oz of water per day. I saw it decrease significantly, but it was still there so I decided to give it some more time.

I also used to eat this specific collagen powder, and I had an amazon subscription for it and I also started that 3 months ago and cut it out as well and then tried it again and I blew up to the 3-4 months pregnancy belly, so I thought I finally found the reason (I thought the formula for the collagen changed because I had been consuming it for years). But it might have been part of the reason, but I am still every other day bloated.

Someone suggested I remove salt from my diet, but I already do not add any extra salt ever.

I also had an ultrasound done and they said a part from some gas, they did not see anything else.

I started eating gas-x at night, I am on day 3, I am not sure if it is too soon for it to make an impact.

Does this sound like anything? TIA for any help.

The brewed coffee was very bland with no noticeable good or bad flavors. As it cooled there is a very slight hint of good light/medium roasted coffee but it is mostly a hint.

Green Coffee: Columbian washed  
Weight: \~150grams

Granted this was the first roast, so there was some learning experiences and the heat definitely wasn't perfectly steady as I removed the gun to check the color multiple times and the temp would dip momentarily and need to build back up. I dropped the beans in around 250°F and they yellowed, and browned in about 5 minutes as the temperature rose. Around 310°Fish I began to hear cracks and within a minute or so a bean got caught under the paddle of the mixer and the motor kicked the bucket up unexpectedly and I frantically had to remove the heat gun to not scorch the beans as the paddle stopped spinning. I tried to keep the heat on it with the top off while holding the bucket down but I have no idea what temp the beans were at or for how long. I had an aluminum pan that was in the freezer ready to go to pour the beans on in an attempt to cool them as quickly as possible.

Is there a guide for how hot beans should get or the temp to drop them in at? I heard 1st crack for sure and the beans were getting darker before the mechanical issue popped up.

I did try a second batch about 30 minutes later, and had no issues mechanically, and repeated the steps. The second time I roasted long enough to get the smoke from the beans after 1st crack, but this batch also lacks much flavor.

Even though I reached 1st crack within 10 minutes, was my heat likely not high or low enough? The beans looked even in color with no dark freckled spots and smelled great after the roast and cooling.",2,1747750850.0,roasting,2,1.0,False

It wasn’t messy or toxic – it was deeply emotional. We talked, cried, and ended things on good terms. She told me she still loves me, but had been unhappy for the last few months. 

She had been telling me for months what she needed – more effort, more presence, more emotional availability. But I was caught up in work and personal stress, thinking things would get better soon and that because we were soulmates, so nothing could ever split us up.  Now that my life is finally calming down and I actually have more time… she’s gone.

We had strong communication, loved each other so much and always supported each other.. But I kept failing to make the real changes she asked for. Eventually, she lost hope. She told me during the breakup that she still loved me, she didn’t want to have to do this, but she felt she had too.

I didn’t accept her offer to stay friends at first - because I knew it would only hurt me but she wanted too. (“I don’t want the last two years to be for nothing, so I don’t want contact to completely end”). At the goodbye, we loosely planned to meet up at some point for coffee two weeks later. Since then, I text her a couple of times a few days after (my mistake) to see if she wanted to talk about things but rejected due to not being ready to talk and needing to focus on herself. We now have been in n/c for 2 weeks now. 

I completely understand where I went wrong and I have explained this to her. I’ve made the choice to start working on myself – not to win her back, but because I’ve realised I wasn't being the kind of partner or man I want to be.

But I’m still struggling with this:

Is it ever the right move to reach out again in the future – and if so, when and how?

Has anyone here truly changed after a breakup and successfully reconnected – or is that just false hope?

Or should I fully let go, even though the love is still there?

I’m not looking for validation. Just honest perspectives from people who’ve been there.

I make a lot of eggs, frozen fish steaks, chicken, steak, I still have my coffee and it doesnt impact me.  Small amounts of veggies like some stir fried power greens also doesnt seem to have a negative impact.

Even if you're turned off to the idea of high animal product diet, just give it a shot for a bit and see what it does for you.  Maybe two weeks?",9,1747750789.0,SIBO,12,0.76,False

The oolong is more like a Pu'er, super earthy and almost like a wood mushroom. It's VERY tea-like, and I want to send glitch some actual high quality peach pit auroma oolong so they can understand how wrong these tasting notes are. The roast is also a bit over-developed for such a delicate taste, a lighter roast on this would have been perfection in my eyes.",1,1747750665.0,coffeerotation,4,1.0,False

They do a pretty good job with noise cancellation for the loud power tools in my shop, but the sound quality is more as you could imagine, and they can be a bit uncomfortable after a while. 

I'd love to go with the M6's, but there isn't a noise cancellation rating I can find, and I am unsure of how well these would perform in a truly loud, noisy environment (vs like an airport or a coffee shop). I also don't have any personal experience with ANC.

Is there anyone here  who has used these headphones (or M4 or M5) in a woodshop/workshop environment? Curious about the performance with blocking out those high db tools.
