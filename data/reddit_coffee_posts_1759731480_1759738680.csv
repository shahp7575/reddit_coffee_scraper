1nzd3yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nzd3yj/steve_the_spider/,Steve the Spider,"Dad says, the grass isn’t greener on the other side.
I nod.
Maybe I’m just negative,
maybe I’m ungrateful,
maybe I could never cope on my own.

There’s a spider on the side of the painting.
Big one.
I think — he could take that one out.
He walks past with blindness.
He doesn’t need to worry —
I clean the cobwebs.

Next day, I say,
“Hey, could you take that spider out?”
“Sure,” he says.
Next day —
Oh, hi spider.
You’re still there.
I text, thanks for taking the spider out.
No reply.

I tell Dad again, I’m tired.
He says, you’ve got a good man, the grass isn’t greener.
And I think maybe he’s right.
The car’s not right, I’ve said it for a month.
“It’s your anxiety,” he says.
Then one morning the phone rings —
it’s broken down.
“Do you have AA?”
Yes.
I sort it, between toast crumbs and the school run,
our daughter half-singing to herself in the back seat.
He comes home.

“It’ll be three and a half grand to fix.”
He asks if I need a car,
could I take the bus?
I stop.
This is more than just the car —
it’s another way I owe him.

He earns eighty, I earn thirty.
We split everything even.
Where’s the rest?
The car’s for our daughter, not for me.
I ask, “Can you afford this?”
He says, “I don’t know.”
I realise — I’ve lived with him six years
and I have no idea what’s in the bank.
If we’re a step from broke
or sitting on thousands.
I don’t even know.

He says he’ll pay for it.
It’s a surprise, he sorts it all.
I should be grateful.
But I’m not.
Why?
I don’t know.

Weekend.
I wake sick — probably my period — shake it off.
Saturday, he’s made breakfast,
I’ve had a lie-in,
coffee waiting.
Why am I so angry?

I sit in the unfinished dining room,
like most other rooms in this house.
Coats on the floor, shoes out.
I can’t afford a shoe rack or a coat rack.
I wonder if he could.
I look at the unfinished hall threshold,
nagged a hundred times.
I leave the room.

He asks what’s wrong.
I don’t want another weekend of moaning.
“I just feel upset at the dining room.”
He says, “Go out, I’ll fix it. Take her.”
Of course —
he can’t work when she’s home.
I wonder who takes her when I wash,
clean,
cook.

I take her out to buy the coat I can’t afford.
We have fun.
I’m feeling more positive.
I come home.
He says he hasn’t stopped.
I’m excited.
He’s cleaned up the drive,
picked up the leaves in the garden.
I walk into the dining room.
Exactly as it was before.

“Oh, but I did the drive, the garden — it took ages.”
I should be grateful, I guess.
But the drive and garden could’ve been done
any time,
with her home.
The dining room will never be finished.
“I’ll do it tomorrow,” he says.
Oh, the tomorrows.
They never come.

Next day, sickness hits hard.
I get up, make her breakfast,
pass out on the sofa.
He takes her out —
ducks, soft play, McDonald’s.
Lovely.
I wish I could just focus on fun.

I’d asked him to print photos for her school project.
He did —
after I asked.
I always have to ask.
I should be grateful.
I’m not.
I lay in bed waiting
for love, attention —
it doesn’t come.
At eight, she kisses me goodnight.
I ask if they’ve had dinner.
Yes.
He’s put pasta in the fridge for me.
Dry and old.
But I should be grateful.

I need water.
I need the light off.
I need medicine.
I need a hug.
Those things don’t happen.

I text — “Can you sort her school bag?”
I wake the next day, fever still.
The bag’s not done.

I walk downstairs.
The spider’s still there.
Hi, spider.
Guess you live here now.
I’ll name you Steve.
You can be my friend.

Because at least you stay
where I can see you.
And you don’t promise
you’ll change

1nzczn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nzczn3/i_cut_people_of_my_life_and_im_upset_because/,I cut people of my life and im upset because theyre spreading unnecessary false information about me,"So a month ago I shifted my place, I used to sit with my friends and we were a group of 4, so its a, b, c and d(me) so when college started it was a and b and these 2 called me and initiated conversation and asked me to come hangout with them.  
today I feel like I made a huge mistake with regards to this. Because a, and b are very bad and c is my close friend. And in the beginning a and b used to despise c and used to be like dont hangout with him and etc but I made him come and hangout with us because c used to be on his own and not hangout with anyone, I just didnt like it when people are on their own.  


So moving on im in year 3 right now and since 2nd year, a and b are close and they would leave me alone and go sit by themselves behind and not call me back with them, I felt this was odd because they would always call me and slowly slowly as time went by they started drifting apart. This was very strange. Year 2 finally got over and it’s year 3 now and it’s been a month and I shifted my place and im sitting on my own now.  
  
in year 2 A asked me to sell something which is precious to me and give him money, I felt this was kinda extreme because if he wanted money he could’ve asked me but asking me to sell something which is important to me just for him? No way!  
  
And after a while that precious thing was sold because of my financial difficulties I was facing. So since then I started believing in evil eye.  
  
and a and b used to make jokes about me having this thing like, sell it, why do u have It, how come ur dad gave it to you, and etc so one day I snapped at B not once but many times.  
  
and like I said I shifted my place a month ago and I feel at peace but at the beginning I used to suggest these fine dinning places for lunch hand etc thinking we would split the bill together but I was wrong, b couldn’t afford it and a and c were not that strong money wise, neither was I. So I just adjusted and went with the flow. And hangout at a local eatery.  
  
and he says that I am very egotistical and I only show off and etc.  
look I believe in eating good will make me be healthy. By eating at the place where I used to adjust, I got gastric.  
Was it really worth it? Now I regret it. And the other day they said we will go to the local eatery but I said no let’s go here because I wanted coffee, and he commented on that saying see bro he has money and etc. basically calling me a  **Show-off**, **FlashyPretentious, Braggart Ostentatious. Flamboyant** , **New money, Materialistic**  who even does that? Because the local eatery does not serve COFFEE. just because of these incidents. theyre dragging my name down, end of the day it doesn't matter to me but it does affect me to some extent.

1nzcye8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1nzcye8/i_felt_let_down_by_my_husband_on_our_big_day/,I felt let down by my husband on our big day,"My husband and I got married in a very intimate ceremony. We chose to do this so we could remain present throughout the day, and then had a celebration that following weekend with close family and friends of around 50 people at our home. We had 4 families flying in for this.

My husband and I agreed that we’d do a lot of the decorations etc. ourselves to save money and noted there would be a lot of running around that morning. I’ve been with him for almost 5 years and there’s been multiple occasions where he has dropped the ball, particularly for social events. I had conversations with him prior to the day letting him know that I would really need his support that day. I would also like to preface that I did 95% of the wedding planning and decision making alone, as well as paid for the entire wedding as I earn more than my husband, and he planned to give me back his share when he got his bonus.

My husband had three jobs:
- buy the beer
- mow the lawn
- put up the festoon lighting

I took a whole week off work in preparation for the day (picking things up, buying things etc.) and he chose to work the day before the party, even though I’d suggested against it. I told him I really needed the lawn mowed ASAP because the furniture was being dropped on the Friday morning. The furniture was then dropped off and put on the unmowed grass. I’m irritated but OK at this point. At 9pm the evening before the party, the lawn still isn’t mowed and he’s gone out to get the beer. Again, irritated, not surprised, but still trusting him to get everything done. I’d also like to mention that he called me on the Thursday afternoon saying that one of his friends will come around to mow the lawn but I’d need to be at home to get him the mower in the garage. I was in the city running errands at this point and unable to do this. He’d even said the morning of the party, “does it really need mowing? Looks alright to me”.

Morning of the party, I’m up at 6am as we are already behind. The lawn isn’t mowed, so I know we’ll have to move the furniture off the lawn so it can be mowed, and then move it back on BEFORE I can organise the tablecloths, table decorations, bar etc. 
I’m begging him to get up out of bed.. he finally gets up just before 9am and sits out on the out on the balcony sipping his coffee. Our guests are arriving at 2pm. At this point, I’m really starting to stress out as I have a hair appointment at 10.30am and I’d planned to use the time after the hair appointment to get myself ready and do any final touches. I am begging him to put his coffee in a take away cup and head to the shops to get a couple of last minute things as we have someone coming to organise the flowers on the tables. He finally leaves at 9.30am and gets home before 10.30am. The flowers are not able to be put on the tables as we still have to remove the tables from the lawn area, so he can mow. I told the flower girl she could leave (she was sat on her phone waiting to put the flowers on the tables and had another party to go to) and I’d do it myself. By this point we’re approaching 11am and my husband is telling me that the chairs are sinking into the grass a bit. I told him multiple times “it’s fine, we don’t have time for this, please, listen to me”. I was begging him to stop talking about these bloody chairs as we had less than 3 hours until guests arrived, the lawn wasn’t mowed, there were no decorations or festoon lighting up and I’m 30 minutes late to my hair appointment. 

At this point, I think I’d almost gone into a state of shock because my husband was practically arguing with me about these chairs and explaining how unsafe it was. I told him to call his uncle and ask him to come over as soon as possible to help him with the festoon lighting, I needed to get to my hair appointment (thankfully, I know my hair stylist and she knew the day would be a bit hectic). I got home at 12pm and thankfully the festoon lighting was up. I helped move the furniture off the lawn (hair all done up!), so my husband could mow. He was mowing until about 1pm. I hastily put the decorations together in about 20 minutes. At this point, the photographer arrives and I need to get in the shower. It’s 1.30pm. People start arriving at 1.43pm and I go into complete panic. I quickly put some make up on my face. I could have cried at this point but I held it together. It’s like I was in a heightened state for the entire celebration. I acted happy but I was absolutely devastated. The first lot of photos that the photographer took, had my foundation not even rubbed in properly. I felt awful and completely not done up for what was supposed to be a really wonderful day. I can’t even bring myself to look at the photos. There were so many decorations and bits and pieces including the Photo Booth props that didn’t even go out, because I didn’t have the time to put them up. I’d planned this day for 9 months down to every last detail. I even bought personalised camera wraps for the disposable cameras.

I’m heartbroken and can’t stop thinking about that day. I feel completely let down by my husband and I feel like I can’t rely on him at all. He knew how important this day was and given there’s been so many balls dropped in the past, I really thought he’d make an effort this time, even after multiple conversations prior to the day. 

I am fine and I have compartmentalised this so I don’t let it consume my every day life. There are certainly worse things to dwell on and by all accounts, it was a good night. I know not everything goes to plan at weddings, but I can’t believe I was let down by the one person I thought would be there to support me.",3,1759737145.0,wedding,9,0.8,False

Today was a busy day starting off with the usual, getting some coffee, then bug testing the Ameeba Chat app. The team is doing a good job, but there's a few persistent bugs that we need to fix in order to grow. The grind is real. Not ready to scale. We did secure a lucrative partnership with a University and their Cybersec students. Had a meeting with their Cybersec director, went well, their students will be working with us. I've also started reaching out to cybersec professionals via other channels. There's a group of 5-10 working on pen testing and auditing Ameeba chat platform. Another 3-4 working on an AI stuff, I'll get to that in a bit, and another working on a proprietary LLM model that is in it's infancy, 4GB RAM GPU needed to get a response. We're tinkering to make it more light.

Another member from reddit reached out to me to help with our noncustodial lightchain wallet integration and Ameon coin, looks like we will have that ironed out, which again will function as fuel for the chat app. i.e free tier vs. subscription.

Meanwhile, I am personally starting to hone in on firmware and hardware security testing, looking to create an assembly line of sorts for our OEM barebone minimalistic smart phones hardened for security. Our plan is to create AmeebaOS and flash it onto the OEM's then test the whole device for any malware, backdoors.  We want to create the most basic, minimalistic, closed loop ecosystem and harden it for ultimate security and privacy. A huge endeavor.

Finally I figured I'd give this sub more attention now that we got this far. I spoke to a newcomer who we approved the other day and they suggested slowing down and building trust here. Great advice, thank you for that feedback.

I am glad to have you guys here and your support goes a long way especially right now. Would love to get to know you as we progress. It's a difficult and challenging endeavor but worth it if it means giving the future generation hope. Can't give up.",1,1759736758.0,ameeba,0,1.0,False

So, I designed these to solve one of those small, daily frustrations.

Here's what makes them special:

* **The satisfying 'Click' of Zero Clutter:** The strongest feature! I embedded powerful magnets in both the coasters and the holder so they **snap instantly and neatly back into place** when you stack them. No more crooked piles or rummaging for the last coaster!
* **Modular for Sharing:** Perfect for when you have people over. The magnets let you easily **combine two or more coasters** to create one big, stable base for a *yuanyang* pot, a wine bottle, or a large serving dish. So useful!
* **Weighted & Solid:** They have a nice, heavy density, so they feel premium and won't stick to the bottom of a cold, sweaty glass when you lift it up (a lifesaver in our humidity!).

I'm super excited to share this with the community. Would love to know what you think of the design.

I need some honest opinions on something that’s gotten complicated.

I’m 24 and my English teacher, who’s 27 and I have been involved for a few months now. She first started teaching me back in my second semester and over time, we got closer through casual talks after class, shared interests and late-night conversations that slowly turned personal.

One evening, I took her out for coffee. We ended up sitting there for hours, talking, laughing and just getting lost in the moment. There was this mutual understanding between us, a connection we couldn’t ignore. She made the first move and we shared a kiss. From there, our bond only deepened.

As months went on, we started seeing each other more privately. We’d talk late at night, go out on quiet weekends and spend time together away from campus where we didn’t have to hide. Eventually, we crossed that line where our relationship became both emotional and physically intimate as One night she called me and after talking for abit the things got dirty and we started playing with ourselves on the call and DAMN it was something I've never experienced before.

Fast forward, when I was in uni she texted me to meet her and she said that we both should have something physical. The same weekend, she booked a room and I picked her up in my car and I was literally shaking as I'm an introvert, we both went into the room and after talking for abit, we started making out and damn she was hotter than ever.

From that day, we go to different hotels on weekends and It’s been passionate and real and we both care for each other deeply.

Recently, she mentioned wanting to make our relationship official, even talking about getting engaged once I graduate. I was surprised but also touched by how serious she feels about us.

Still, I can’t help but worry about the long-term consequences, the power dynamic, the fact that she’s my teacher and how others might see it. I genuinely love being with her but I’m not sure if it’s right to move forward or if emotions have clouded our judgment.

I’ve been diving into pour-over coffee for the past 4 months, usually making 1 to 3 cups a day. But no matter what I do, my brews always come out bitter and lacking the clarity or flavor I get from coffee shops.

Here’s my current setup and routine:

* **Grinder:** Timemore C2S
* **Grind size:** 18–22 clicks (fairly coarse)
* **Water temp:** \~88–92°C
* **Water:** Using bottled water (someone recommended a specific brand, but even that didn’t help)
* **Gear:** Started with a regular V60, now using a V60 Switch + Mugen
* **Brew method:** Tetsu’s hybrid method (Switch closed for bloom + immersion, then open for drawdown)

Despite all this, the coffee still ends up tasting consistently bitter. I’ve tried diluting with more water after brewing, but that doesn't fix the flavor either.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Could it be my grind size, water, or technique? I feel like I’ve tried most of the common fixes but still can’t get a clean, balanced cup. The beans are premium single origins from different roasters, yet they taste mediocre.

# Manufacturing Process

# 1. Ingredient Preparation

* **Dry Mix:** Wheat flour, corn starch, and cocoa powder are precisely blended for consistent texture.
* **Wet Mix:** Sugar syrup, emulsifiers, and vegetable oil are prepared separately to ensure uniform moisture and binding.
* **Cream Base:** Cocoa mass, sugar, milk solids, and vegetable fat are mixed and refined to form the [smooth chocolate filling](https://www.unwraphappiness.in/collections/wafer-rolls).

# 2. Wafer Batter Formation

* The dry and wet ingredients are combined to create a thin, pourable batter.
* The batter is filtered to remove any lumps ensuring a fine, even spread.

# 3. Baking

* The batter is poured onto **rotary baking plates** or **wafer roll baking drums**.
* The thin sheets are baked at a controlled temperature (around 160–180°C) until crisp and golden.

# 4. Rolling

* While still warm and flexible, the baked sheets are rolled into tubular shapes using precision rollers.
* The diameter and thickness are calibrated for uniformity.

# 5. Filling

* Once cooled, the hollow rolls are [filled with chocolate cream](https://www.unwraphappiness.in/products/le-classico-choco-rolls) through a high-speed injector.
* The filling temperature and viscosity are closely controlled to maintain smoothness and prevent cracking.

# 6. Cooling & Curing

* Filled rolls pass through a **cooling tunnel** (10–12°C) to set the cream and stabilize the structure.

# 7. Cutting & Inspection

* Rolls are cut to desired lengths (commonly 80–100 mm).
* Defective or broken pieces are removed through visual and automated quality checks.

# 8. Packaging

* Rolls are flow-wrapped in **moisture-barrier films** to retain [crispness and flavor](https://www.unwraphappiness.in/products/le-classico-choco-rolls).
* Packaged in cartons or tins for enhanced shelf life and premium appeal.

And where's the aroma that everyone talks of? The aroma stays within the mug itself, it does not bloom in the air as advertised everywhere. Even by neutral reviewers on this sub. 

(Note that if you purchase 100 gm bottles, both coffee come at the same price. Nothing luxe about the Davidoff one. In fact, the Davidoff will be less expensive.)",2,1759735516.0,SnacksIndia,3,0.75,False

And the next day i couldn't stop thinking about not being able to sleep again that night. I didn't sleep till 6:30 and 8:30 i woke up. Luckily the next day i slept and i thought my problems were over bc it didn't happen again.
Like 2 weeks ago it happened again, i lied awake in bed with my eyes closed and i didn't sleep AT ALL, just 30 minutes. The next day i was really scared again, and it was so hard to sleep but i ended up sleeping like 5 hours. It didn't happen again. Until last night. I was in a family reuning, i had pepsi, and at like 12am a little coffee so maybe that was too much cafeine? I went to sleep at 2:30 after being with my phone but i just couldn't sleep. I think i ended up sleeping in total maybe 2 hours. I had a nap in the afternoon i think, but im not sure.

Now its 4:21am and i can't sleep. I swear im not thinking about sleeping but i just can't sleep. And now i'm afraid of tomorrow also not sleeping at all.

Since I started attending we have had  15 people join who are now catechumens including myself. Unfortunately none of the baptized members are willing to godparent. I don't want to sow discourse in the parish but I have subtly asked the others how their searches are going and we all seem to be in the same boat.
 At the end of liturgy yesterday the priest announced to all of us that we need to really be praying to find someone and the search continues. I hate to say this but I just feel like our priest and Matushka are uninterested in the whole thing. They are an older couple and our priest also announced that he missed the opportunity to have our newly elected bishop visit. It feels really disheartening. I know he's a busy guy but maybe he would have been able to help us in some way, IDK.
 So what can one do in this situation? I really just want to get my younger children baptized most of all. Living in the US, things feel a little scary right now so their baptisms feel so important.

**Chapter** 1 

On my son Marvin Gardner’s third birthday, my mother–in–law Margaret Webb had one drink too many and wouldn’t stop smothering him with kisses. 

She pinched Marvin’s chubby cheeks while slurring to my husband, Tommy Gardner. 

“This boy is something else. His eyes and brows are just like yours, but his nose and mouth…” 

She paused, squinting at my younger sister, Jessica Walsh, who was peeling an apple beside me. 

“His nose and mouth look exactly like hers!” 

Everyone in the room froze. 

The only sound left was the cartoon blaring from the television. 

Jessica’s hand jerked. 

Tommy’s face turned dark in an instant. 

He jumped up and snapped at Margaret, “Mom! You’re drunk. Stop talking nonsense!” 

I sat on the couch, watching them, and smiled. “She’s not wrong.” 

I tilted my head toward the pale–faced Jessica and Tommy, who couldn’t meet my eyes. 

“I’ve always wondered why Marvy looks so much like Jessica.”

He practically lunged forward, snatching Marvin from Margaret’s arms as if he were afraid I would look too closely. 

“Don’t listen to her,” he said stiffly with his back to me. “She’s old and confused. Everyone looks alike to her now.” 

Jessica scrambled to her feet, forcing a smile. 

“Annie, Margaret was just joking. Kids change every day. No one can say for sure who they look like yet.” 

Really? 

For three years, I had buried a thought too terrifying to admit, but in that moment, it came rushing back. 

Marvin was the child I carried for ten months and nearly died bringing into the world. 

But from the day he was born, he never resembled me. 

Everyone said he took after Tommy. I repeated that to myself too, until I almost believed it. 

But as Marvin grew, his features sharpened, and the shadow of Jessica appeared clearer on his face. 

The same almond–shaped eyes, the dimple that showed in the same spot when he smiled, even the little pout when he slept–it was all her. 

I once convinced myself it was just family resemblance. After all, she was my sister. 

But with one careless remark tonight, Margaret ripped away the illusion I had been fooling myself with.

“Alright, that’s enough. Everyone, sit down.”

My tone was soft, but my gaze lingered on her ashen face.

Relieved, he hurried into the bathroom with Marvin. 

Dinner was unbearably quiet.

I, on the other hand, played the perfect hostess–serving Marvin food, pouring soup for Tommy, even asking Jessica about her work with a smile. 

The calmer I acted, the more uneasy they became.

1nzcgci,https://www.reddit.com/r/EternalEvolutionSF/comments/1nzcgci/purpose_of_human_life/,"purpose of human life,","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

**Chapter** 1 

On my son Marvin Gardner’s third birthday, my mother–in–law Margaret Webb had one drink too many and wouldn’t stop smothering him with kisses. 

She pinched Marvin’s chubby cheeks while slurring to my husband, Tommy Gardner. 

“This boy is something else. His eyes and brows are just like yours, but his nose and mouth…” 

She paused, squinting at my younger sister, Jessica Walsh, who was peeling an apple beside me. 

“His nose and mouth look exactly like hers!” 

Everyone in the room froze. 

The only sound left was the cartoon blaring from the television. 

Jessica’s hand jerked. 

Tommy’s face turned dark in an instant. 

He jumped up and snapped at Margaret, “Mom! You’re drunk. Stop talking nonsense!” 

I sat on the couch, watching them, and smiled. “She’s not wrong.” 

I tilted my head toward the pale–faced Jessica and Tommy, who couldn’t meet my eyes. 

“I’ve always wondered why Marvy looks so much like Jessica.”

Chapter 1 

Tommy panicked more than I expected.

He practically lunged forward, snatching Marvin from Margaret’s arms as if he were afraid I would look too closely. 

“Don’t listen to her,” he said stiffly with his back to me. “She’s old and confused. Everyone looks alike to her now.” 

Jessica scrambled to her feet, forcing a smile. 

“Annie, Margaret was just joking. Kids change every day. No one can say for sure who they look like yet.” 

Really? 

For three years, I had buried a thought too terrifying to admit, but in that moment, it came rushing back. 

Marvin was the child I carried for ten months and nearly died bringing into the world. 

But from the day he was born, he never resembled me. 

Everyone said he took after Tommy. I repeated that to myself too, until I almost believed it. 

But as Marvin grew, his features sharpened, and the shadow of Jessica appeared clearer on his face. 

The same almond–shaped eyes, the dimple that showed in the same spot when he smiled, even the little pout when he slept–it was all her. 

I once convinced myself it was just family resemblance. After all, she was my sister. 

But with one careless remark tonight, Margaret ripped away the illusion I had been fooling myself with.

“Alright, that’s enough. Everyone, sit down.” 

I stood calmly, took a tissue from the coffee table, and walked over to Jessica. 

I gently pressed the tissue to her bleeding hand. “How did you get so careless?” 

My tone was soft, but my gaze lingered on her ashen face. 

She avoided my eyes, stammering, “I… I’m fine, Annie.” 

Tommy stood frozen, clutching Marvin like a shield.

I smiled and turned to him. “Dinner’s ready. Wash his hands and let’s eat. 

My voice was so even, it was as if nothing had happened. 

Relieved, he hurried into the bathroom with Marvin. 

Dinner was unbearably quiet. 

Margaret seemed to realize she had said too much and kept her head down, eating in silence. 

I, on the other hand, played the perfect hostess–serving Marvin food, pouring soup for Tommy, even asking Jessica about her work with a smile. 

The calmer I acted, the more uneasy they became. 

The meal felt like a silent execution. 

Afterward, Tommy rushed to wash the dishes, while Jessica muttered something about urgent work and hurried to leave. 

“Wait,” I said.

She froze at the doorway. 

I pulled out a bag and filled it to the brim with cherries from the fridge before handing it to her. 

“Take these. You’ve always loved them.” 

Her hands trembled as she accepted the bag, eyes lowered. “Thanks, Annie.”

“You’re welcome.” I brushed a strand of hair from her face, leaning close enough for only her to hear. 

“Jess, next time you come over, don’t wear perfume. You know Marvy is allergic to that one. 

Her body stiffened, pupils tightening in shock. 

I straightened and patted her shoulder with a smile. “Drive safe.” 

When the door clicked shut, the smile on my face faded. 

From the kitchen came the sound of running water. 

Tommy was at the sink, washing dishes, his broad back familiar and comforting. He was the person I had always felt safest with. 

I stared at him for a long moment before speaking. “Tommy.” 

He froze mid–motion. 

“Do you remember when I had Marvy? When I hemorrhaged so badly that 

the doctors issued a critical alert?” 

He didn’t turn around. His voice was low and strained, “I remember.” 

I continued. “I was lying in that hospital bed, thinking I was going to die.

“Stop it!”

He spun around suddenly, his face etched with pain, eyes red–rimmed. 

“Angeline, you’re not going to die! We’re a family. We’ll be fine!” 

I looked at him and, unexpectedly, smiled. 

“Tommy,” I asked, carefully, word by word. “Is there something you’ve been hiding from me?”

I’m deep researching into Nano vs Link. It’s a $1.3k price difference between them ($1600 AUD vs $2900 AUD).

Trying to understand if it’s worth the price difference, how simple they are to use.

My bean composition is attached, not sure if it needs the customization of the link or if it’s easier with the link because of the app?

I like the ability to go larger batch sizes with the Nano.

1nzcbzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1nzcbzh/an_ode_to_us/,An ode to us,"October 5th, 2024

The day began like so many lately, quietly sorting through the pieces of my old life to make room for something new. In the middle of clearing out, I had one of my clumsy moments and ended up in the ER with a suspected foot fracture. While I was waiting, I decided on a whim to download Bumble.

I had been talking with a friend earlier that day about how online dating often felt like a revolving door of ghosting and shallow connections. I had already tried Hinge and felt disappointed. A few people were kind, some only wanted something casual, but nothing felt like what I really needed.

I told myself Bumble would be my last try. And then I saw your profile.

There was something in your eyes, soft, gentle, and kind, and that big, slightly cheeky grin. My daughter was actually telling me to go back and look at a fireman’s profile, but I clicked on you instead. I answered your prompt, “What are you most looking forward to?” and thought maybe, just maybe, something would be different this time.

Looking back now, I had no idea what I was walking into. All I knew was that I wanted someone to talk with, someone to share ideas and laughter with, someone who felt like more than just another message on a screen.

When we started talking, you were instantly the easiest person to open up to. Smart, self-aware, funny. Even when you teased me about my decaf coffee, it felt natural. I asked for a phone call just to be sure you were real. That first night, after we spoke, I went to bed excited to meet you.

I remember feeling nervous as the day of our first coffee/dinner approached. I almost talked myself out of it. But then I saw you walking towards me in a white shirt and blue jeans, curls in your hair, and that smile, and I felt at ease. You were handsome, yes, but more than that, you were warm and steady.

That night ended up being one of the first times in my life I truly felt taken care of. You were reassuring, polite, attentive, making sure I was okay every step of the way. Since then, you have continued to be that same polite and reassuring man when we are together. With you, I have felt safe both physically and emotionally.

This past year has been a journey of learning and growing for me. You have been a part of that. You have given me someone to talk to about dreams, hopes, goals, and also the hard stuff. I have had my moments of doubt and fear, but even then, you have never raised your voice or shut me down. You have let me find my footing and heal in ways I did not expect.

They say a good connection acts as a mirror, showing you what you most need to see in order to grow. You have been that mirror for me.

You have also let me love you, cherish you, and discover emotional and physical closeness I did not know I could feel. Those moments we have shared are precious to me, and I hold them close.

I do not know what the future holds because none of us do. Life is unpredictable and often messy. But right now, life with you is fun, safe, and full of moments I treasure. There is no one else I would rather share my highlights with at this point in my journey.

So this is not meant to feel heavy or full of expectation. It is simply me honouring what you have given me in the last 12 months, the connection, the safety, the laughter, and the learning.

Here is to everything we have both achieved individually and together this past year.

* Normally, **adenosine** builds up in your brain during the day, making you feel sleepy.
* Caffeine **blocks adenosine receptors**, so you feel alert and awake for a few hours.

# 🧠 2. Adenosine Keeps Building Up

* While caffeine blocks the receptors, adenosine doesn’t stop forming—it just can’t attach.
* Once caffeine wears off, **all the stored adenosine floods your brain**, causing a sudden wave of tiredness — often called a **“caffeine crash.”**

# ❤️ 3. Stress Hormones Drop

* Caffeine triggers the release of **adrenaline and dopamine**, which increase focus and energy.
* As caffeine fades, these hormones drop, leading to **fatigue, irritability, or low mood**.

# 💧 4. Possible Dehydration and Blood Sugar Dip

* Coffee is mildly **diuretic**, which may dehydrate you slightly.
* It can also cause a **temporary rise and then fall in blood sugar**, contributing to tiredness.

We’ve been doing some research and brainstorming, but before we dive in headfirst, I wanted to ask the community that have more experience here. 

I know these are general questions but: 

What are some things we should be aware of before getting started? 

Some specific questions in mind:
1. Are there any common pitfalls or rookie mistakes we should avoid? 

2. How do you go about finding good locations for machines? 

3. Any tips on choosing reliable vending machines or suppliers? 

4. Is it better to start with pre-made coffee & tea? 

5. If I use a brand like Milo or Nestle, into our machines, will there be any infringement in branding legally speaking?

From caffeine-loaded thermogenics to herbal blends promising “miracle” results, each brand claims to be the best. But where does [Trimtone ](https://us-testogen.com/)stand among them? Let’s break down what makes this women-focused fat burner different from the rest.

# 1. Specifically Formulated for Women

Unlike most fat burners designed for both men and women, **Trimtone** was created with women’s metabolism, hormones, and lifestyle in mind. Many women struggle with slower metabolic rates, food cravings, and fluctuating energy throughout the day. Trimtone’s formula supports fat loss gently but effectively—without the harsh stimulants or extreme crash often experienced with unisex fat burners.

Its ingredients help boost thermogenesis (the body’s natural fat-burning process) while supporting energy and appetite control—key factors in sustainable weight loss.

# 2. Natural, Transparent Formula

One of Trimtone’s biggest strengths is its **clean, transparent ingredient list**. Many fat burners hide their formulas behind “proprietary blends,” leaving users in the dark about dosages. Trimtone, however, clearly lists each ingredient and its quantity, so you know exactly what you’re putting in your body.

Its five active ingredients include:

* **Caffeine** – Increases metabolism and energy.
* **Green Tea Extract** – A natural source of antioxidants that enhances fat oxidation.
* **Green Coffee Bean Extract** – Helps regulate blood sugar and supports fat metabolism.
* **Grains of Paradise** – A thermogenic spice shown to activate brown fat for calorie burning.
* **Glucomannan** – A natural dietary fiber that promotes fullness and helps control appetite.

This minimal yet powerful blend avoids fillers and synthetic additives found in many other fat burners.

# 3. One Capsule a Day Convenience

While other supplements require multiple doses throughout the day, **Trimtone simplifies fat-burning** with a single daily capsule. Taken in the morning with water, it jumpstarts metabolism early and helps keep appetite under control all day. For busy women, this one-step routine is easy to maintain long-term.

# 4. Balanced Energy—No Jitters or Crashes

Many fat burners overload the body with caffeine, leading to anxiety, jitters, or an afternoon energy crash. Trimtone contains **a moderate 120 mg of caffeine**, enough to enhance alertness and calorie burn without overwhelming the nervous system. It provides smooth, sustained energy—ideal for both gym workouts and daily productivity.

# 5. Appetite Control and Sustainable Results

What truly sets Trimtone apart is its inclusion of **glucomannan**, a clinically backed fiber that expands in the stomach to reduce hunger. This helps women manage cravings and stick to calorie goals more easily. Most fat burners focus solely on energy and thermogenesis, but Trimtone supports long-term weight management by addressing appetite—the root cause of overeating.

# Final Thoughts

Trimtone stands out for its simplicity, transparency, and focus on women’s needs. It’s not overloaded with stimulants or hidden ingredients—it’s a clean, natural, and convenient fat burner that helps you feel in control of your fitness journey.

While no supplement can replace proper diet and exercise, **Trimtone** can be a powerful ally in accelerating your fat loss results safely and sustainably.",1,1759734205.0,u_Ancient_Parfait_5219,0,1.0,False

Here is Part 12 of Our Reality, which follows Yuri. The Literature Club has a night in, sharing a meal and how they are feeling after a few days in the real world. Natsuki shares an idea with Yuri, and Monika's nightmare continues to haunt her. 

[A Night In for the Literature Club](https://i.imgur.com/Jx702HQ.png)

  
**Part 12: Our Night In (Yuri)**

Yuri put her phone down and sat back on the fabric-upholstered couch in Sayuri’s living room.

“I have informed MC and Natsuki that our dinner has been delivered. I expect they will arrive here shortly.”

“Sounds good,” Sayuri replied, leaning her head out from the kitchen, “Do you mind if we open that bottle of wine you brought?”

Yuri nodded and stood to retrieve the bottle from her bag. “Yes, I think it would be a wonderful accompaniment to the dishes that we have selected.”

*I do hope that I made a good choice in selecting that bottle.*

“And unlike the last time you brought a bottle to a club activity, we can actually legally drink this wine,” Monika reminded her from the other end of the couch with a smile.

Yuri blushed with embarrassment. *Indeed, this is a much more positive situation wine-wise.*

She walked to the kitchen, placed the bottle on the gray granite counter, and opened it using a corkscrew as Sayori placed two wine glasses on the counter next to the bottle.

“Here you go! I’ll get a few more down for everyone else.”

Yuri smiled as she poured the deep garnet-colored pinot noir into the glasses Sayori had provided. She picked one up and took a small sip.

*Lovely. And even more lovely to share such a nice wine with my best friends.*

As Sayori placed more glasses down next to the bottle, Yuri handed her the other full glass.

“Cheers, Sayori.”

“Cheers, Yuri!”

Sayori took a large gulp from her glass.

“Ooh…that’s really good, but really strong!”

Sayuri looked over at her cousin with amusement. “Sayori, I don’t think you’re supposed to drink it that fast. Follow Yuri’s example and just sip it.”

Sayori smiled sheepishly and took a smaller sip from her glass. “I guess I still have a lot to learn about wine.”

Before the discussion of wine drinking could be furthered, there was a knock on the door.

“I’ll get it,” Monika called from the living room.

She opened the door and MC and Natsuki entered.

“Hey everybody, the party’s here!” Natsuki announced.

“Yay!” Sayori exclaimed, throwing her arms around Natsuki, “We’re all here! Time for a club night in!”

“Hey there,” MC said with a smile.

Sayori let go of Natsuki and embraced MC. They shared a quick kiss as Natsuki made a face of mock disgust.

“Get a room, you two!”

MC stuck out his tongue at Natsuki. “Maybe we will.”

Yuri giggled as she observed their banter.

*Their interactions are so amusing. I admire how naturally they can playfully tease one another. I would like to take part in that…but…I’d just say the wrong thing.*

“You all have arrived at the perfect time. Sayuri and Monika are setting up the food, and I have poured glasses of wine for us.”

“Awesome. Thanks everyone!” Natsuki said, “The food smells great.”

She stepped closer to Yuri to talk privately. “And hey…when you have a minute, there’s something I want to chat with you about.”

Yuri looked startled. *Oh no. Did I do something wrong?*

Natsuki smiled reassuringly. “Don’t worry, it’s something good. I was talking to MC’s bosses over happy hour, and we came up with a business idea that I think would work well for both of us.”

Yuri’s expression changed to a smile. “Oh? That sounds quite interesting. I believe that I may also have an idea that would play to both of our strengths. Perhaps we can discuss it over a cup of tea?”

*I wonder if she has imagined the same bakery and tea house that I have. Though…I should not get my hopes up.*

Natsuki nodded. “Sounds like a plan. Let’s talk more tomorrow about it. We’ll probably all be too tired after club time tonight.”

The group filled their plates from the trays of food in the kitchen and sat down on the couch and chairs in Sayuri’s living room, catching up on each other’s days as they ate.

“Thanks for hosting us tonight, Sayuri,” Monika began.

Sayuri waved her hand. “No problem. I’m glad to have all of you over. I think we all kind of needed a night in like this.”

“For sure,” Sayori agreed, “I’m definitely really tired after everything today. We got a lot done and found so many cute outfits though.”

“Sorry again about disrupting the medical checkup,” Sayuri said, still somewhat embarrassed about her earlier actions.

“You have nothing to apologize for, Sayuri,” Monika reassured her, “Everyone has their fears.”

“I know, and I appreciate what you’re saying,” Sayuri replied, “But…I still feel like I let all of you down today by interrupting things and making you worry about me.”

“Look on the bright side, Sayuri,” Natsuki offered, “Your panic attack meant we didn’t have to sit through those scans. I heard they each take at least half an hour. BORING!”

Yuri nearly choked on a noodle as she joined the rest of the group in laughing at Natsuki’s blunt remarks.

*Natsuki makes such pointed statements, but they seem to fit the situation perfectly. I admire her timing and delivery.*

“Thanks, Natsuki,” Sayuri said with a grin, “I needed that.”

“Any time,” Natsuki replied, returning the grin, “How’d your afternoon shopping go?”

“So good,” Sayuri declared, “I found a few more casual outfits, several pairs of shoes, and a really cute strapless one-piece swimsuit.”

MC turned to Sayori. “Did you find any ultra skimpy bikinis?”

Sayori rolled her eyes. “In your dreams, MC.”

“I concur with Sayuri,” Yuri chimed in, “I can now say with certainty that I have a wardrobe for all occasions.”

*Though I’m not entirely sure about my choice of swimwear. Did I choose something too revealing?*

“It really was a great shopping trip,” Monika agreed, “There are so many great stores around here between the underground mall and the department store next door.”

“We even stopped through the car showroom in the lobby of our building,” Sayori added, “We didn’t buy anything yet, but I’ve decided that I’m getting a convertible.”

“Nice,” MC said approvingly, “Car shopping is about the only kind of shopping I’d enjoy.”

Monika rolled her eyes. “Yeah, yeah, we know. You’re such a guy, MC.”

MC smirked and took a sip from his glass of wine. “Yes. Yes, I am.”

Sayori turned to her boyfriend. “How was manga time?”

“The library was really crowded,” MC explained, “So we had to walk around the mall for a while. We checked out the bookstore for a bit and then we eventually found a place to sit. We ended up finishing a whole volume of the series we’re reading.”

“Yeah we really ripped through it,” Natsuki continued, “I need to go back to the bookstore and pick up volume two tomorrow.”

“Do you think you will speak again with that guy you mentioned previously?” Yuri asked.

Natsuki sighed. “He was working there when MC and I stopped in. He…um…thought that MC was my boyfriend and walked away.”

“Wow, your luck with this guy is flat out terrible!” Sayori declared.

Yuri shook her head.

*There is far more to this situation than can be explained by luck.*

“I do not believe that poor luck is solely the fundamental cause of the difficulties that you have been facing, Natsuki,” she began.

Natsuki prepared to issue a retort but thought better of it and tried to cover her change in plans by shoveling a large bite of rice into her mouth.

“Since you are an attractive young woman, young men who find you appealing may make the not unreasonable assumption that you already have a boyfriend. You have previously rebuffed an invitation and compliment from the young man in question. In today’s encounter you were accompanied by MC, who is an attractive young man.”

Yuri paused and blushed slightly as she realized what she had just said.

*Oh no. I do not want to create the impression that I personally am interested in MC.*

“Please continue, Yuri,” MC said encouragingly, “I’d like to hear more about how girls find me attractive.”

“No, please don’t continue, Yuri,” Natsuki interjected, “His ego will pop if it gets inflated anymore.”

“And besides,” Sayori added, grabbing MC’s arm with a possessiveness that was not entirely facetious, “You’re mine. But seriously though, why did the guy in the bookstore think you two were together?”

“It wasn’t just him,” Natsuki continued with exasperation, “The person we talked to at the jewelry store thought we were together too!”

“It really should not be that surprising,” Yuri continued, “Not only were you with a man who is not unattractive, since you and MC are close friends, an individual observing your interactions and banter could easily come to the conclusion that you are in a romantic relationship.”

“Hold it,” Sayori interjected, “What were you looking for at a jewelry store?”

Monika giggled, “Sayori, I suspect MC was looking for a present for you. You don’t want to ruin a potential surprise by asking too much.”

“Yeah, what Monika said,” MC agreed, trying to quickly change the subject, “You’ll find out soon enough, Sayori. On a not so related topic, would tomorrow night be good for date night?”

Sayori nodded enthusiastically. “Of course! But now I’m not sure whether I want you to tell me what you have planned or for it to be a surprise. How about…can you tell me how dressed up I should get?”

MC thought for a moment, running through his plan for the date in his mind. “Nice but not overly formal,” he answered, “I’ve picked out a restaurant that’s pretty intimate that I think you’ll like, and then we’ll go for an after-dinner drink and some dessert.”

Sayori gave MC’s arm an approving squeeze. “Sounds wonderful. I think I have just the dress for that!”

“I ran through MC’s date plan with him this afternoon,” Natsuki explained, “It’s solid. I wanted to make sure that anyone who takes a member of the Literature Club out on a date plans something that is worthy of us.”

Yuri smiled as she observed the exchange.

*Natsuki definitely looks out for us…we may not always see eye to eye, but I have very much come to respect and admire her spirited way of seeing the world.*

“Speaking of which,” Natsuki added as she turned to Sayuri, “A very nice date has also been planned for you. I think a little more formal than what MC has planned for Sayori, but every bit as good. Just a little different.”

Sayuri sat back in her chair, visibly pleased. “I’ve already got my outfit picked out. I’m going to wear the short purple dress I got this morning.”

“Sounds like you both will have busy evenings tomorrow,” Monika observed, “For those of us who don’t have dates tomorrow night, how do we feel about all going to see a movie? When we walked by the movie theater in the mall today, I saw that there is a new romantic comedy film out that looked funny.”

Yuri looked at Monika with surprise. “So, in the absence of romantic entanglements tomorrow, are you suggesting a ‘girls’ night out’ for us?”

Monika smiled and nodded. “Exactly. I think it will be a fun time for all of us. We can go watch a movie, grab some dinner, and maybe a drink or ice cream. Just a relaxing night out.”

“Sounds good to me,” Natsuki declared, “I’d rather spend my evening with you girls. It’s not like I really wanted to go out with that guy anyway.”

Yuri frowned. *She continually denies her interest. I suppose this is a defense mechanism for hiding her disappointment. If I were to point that out, she would likely become unhappy. Perhaps the best course of action right now is to say nothing.*

“So, it’s decided then,” Monika concluded, “We can discuss more tomorrow.”

The group continued to eat in silence for the next several minutes, enjoying their meals and each other’s company.

Sayori finished her last bite of orange chicken and sat back on the couch with a satisfied sigh. “That was really good. And it felt great to not have any social pressure for a change. Staying in tonight was the right call. Now, what’s for dessert?”

Sayuri gestured towards the kitchen. “I picked up a tray of assorted baked goods at the supermarket this afternoon. There are cookies, brownies, and a few other things.”

Sayori grinned at the prospect of sweets. “Great! I’ll go grab it and bring it in here for everyone.”

She stood and walked into the kitchen.

“Okay, everyone,” Monika said, “While we eat dessert I wanted to have a little club check in time. We’ve been here for a few days now and this is some private time just for us, so I wanted to talk about how we’re adjusting to this new world.”

“How do we want to go about doing that?” Sayuri asked, “Just open floor or maybe go around the room and each share?”

Monika nodded. “I like the idea of going around the room. Let’s each give an update on how we’re feeling about our new living situation, any challenges you want to share, and any thoughts on possible careers. And since you’re next to me, Sayuri, why don’t you start?”

Sayuri looked briefly startled but quickly composed herself. “O-okay. Well…I’m still happy to be here so far for sure. I feel incredibly lucky but completely undeserving…I mean, were it not for a couple of mistaken keystrokes I wouldn’t even exist…”

She trailed off for a long moment, her eyes seeming to stare off into space, before shaking her head.

“Sorry. I kind of freak myself out whenever I think too much about how easily I could have not existed or ceased to exist. But anyway, I’ll start with the positives. I love my new home, I got to go shopping with my best friends today, and I’ve got a date tomorrow. Still haven’t figured out what I want to do for work, but I’m thinking about going into business. Maybe go back to school for an advanced degree. I’m really happy to have all of you in my lives and so thrilled to have family in Yuri and Sayori. I think without you all I would be overwhelmed to the point of being unable to function. Thank you all for being so supportive after I freaked out today.”

Sayuri glanced down at the floor. When she spoke again, her voice was quiet.

“When we were all trying to leave our digital reality…you all could have abandoned me and left as a test subject for Metaverse…but you didn’t. You fought for me. I had a nightmare about being left behind last night. Of being stuck in a digital world knowing that my friends were on the other side and that I was the only real thing left in my world and just a plaything for engineers to observe.”

Monika visibly shuddered at Sayuri’s words, while Sayori leaned over and gave her cousin a big hug.

“Sayuri, I’m so glad you’re here,” Sayori whispered, “What would I do without my cousin?”

Sayuri nodded slowly and smiled as her cousin continued to embrace her. “I’m glad I’m here too. I guess to summarize I’m still dealing with a lot of challenges and some self-doubt, but I feel like I can be myself when I’m with you all. You know I can come off as emotionless to new people, but here I feel like I can let it all out.”

“We are all still learning together,” Yuri observed, “We are having experiences the likes of which none of us could have ever dreamed just a few days ago.”

She frowned as she fought back memories of her past.

*I thought it was over for me…my mind betrayed me as if all my darkest impulses overrode all rational thought. I confessed to MC in the manner of a crazed yandere. As I told Monika, what should have been a nice literature club turned into a yandere simulator.*

“Yuri, are you okay?” Natsuki asked, waving her hand in front of Yuri’s face.

Yuri blinked. “My apologies. I believe I was lost in my thoughts for a moment.”

“Sayori, why don’t you go next?” Monika suggested.

Sayori nodded. “Okay! Well, like Sayuri I’ll start with the positives. We all made it here safely, we have a wonderful place to live, and friends and family that care about us. Oh, and a boyfriend who loves me and actually got a job. You’ve come so far from the NEET that I had to drag to the literature club, MC.”

She paused, and her face took on a contemplative expression.

“I also want to share an update on my…condition. The rain clouds are still here, but now that I know I’m not facing them alone it makes it less scary. How did you put it, Sayuri?”

Sayuri smiled. “Let us be your raincoat.”

Natsuki grinned. “That’s a great metaphor. I really like it.”

“All that said,” Sayori continued, “There are still times when I get really dark thoughts. I mentioned my thoughts…of not wanting to exist…to the doctor today, and I’m going to try to schedule an appointment with a therapist.”

“That sounds like a good idea,” MC said supportively, “We’ll help however we can, but I know there are some things that are just beyond our ability.”

Sayori nodded. “I also think I’m going to explore career options where I can help people like me. Maybe I’ll become a therapist myself someday. But for now, I need to work on my mental health.”

MC gave his girlfriend a tight hug.

“MC?” Monika prompted.

“Oh…well I guess I’ll echo a lot of what Sayori and Sayuri said,” MC began, “This building is really cool and I’m really glad we’re all here together. Work is going well, and I even played video games with my boss during the workday yesterday.”

Monika gave MC a look of exasperation. “You’re getting paid to play video games?”

MC laughed. “Not really…but my boss does say that it’s good to take breaks from coding every now and then and that video games can be a good way to clear your head. But I’ve been getting ready to go out to Metaverse HQ next week for a few days so I’m excited but also a little nervous for business travel.”

Sayuri held up a hand.

“Speaking of such things, please bring the Music Club home. They agreed to help out with the Metaverse project, but they are going to need someone looking out for them. I’m counting on you and everyone else at FXI to get that done.”

MC nodded. “I’ll do everything I can. And I won’t be going this one alone. My boss is coming along on this trip as well.”

Sayuri smiled gratefully. “Thank you, MC. We all got to fly home for Christmas. They should too.”

The entire group nodded in agreement with Sayuri’s sentiment.

“Okay,” Monika said, “Natsuki, how about you?”

Natsuki sighed. “You’ve pretty much heard everything from me already. I got asked out, I handled it poorly, and now everyone seems to think that this dummy that I read manga with is my boyfriend. But…I will also say that the manga selection here rules, the library is one the most relaxing places I’ve ever been to, and I’ve decided that I’m going to start studying the French language with the goal of going over there to learn to be a pastry chef.”

“That’s a great goal!” Sayori said supportively, “Then you can make us all kinds of great desserts for club time!”

“At first I thought it was a wacky and silly idea,” Natsuki continued, “But as I’ve shared it a bit with you all, you’ve helped me realize that it’s something that I think I can do.”

“Perhaps someday we’ll all come visit you in Paris or Marseille,” Monika suggested, “I’d love to sit at a café and enjoy a coffee and fresh croissants.”

“I’d be disappointed if you guys didn’t come visit,” Natsuki replied, “We need to take opportunities to see the world. Alright, who’s next?”

Yuri raised her hand. “I suppose that I would be next in line.”

*Everyone else is being vulnerable and sharing their hopes and fears. You can do it too, Yuri.*

Yuri took a deep breath. “I believe that having my own space here provides tranquility when I desire it. Sometimes I just sit and stare out at the city and wonder about all the stories it has to tell. On the other hand, having the absolutely spectacular library downstairs means that I get to spend quality time with my best friends reading literature. All in all, a ‘win-win’ one might say.”

*That’s a good start. Now I must share my deeper feelings.*

She rolled up her sleeves and showed her forearms to her friends. “As you are all aware, I have at times suffered from thoughts of self-harm and have acted on them in the past. Before I was brought here through the use of Metaverse technology, I specifically requested the removal of my scars from the body model. Not because I wish to erase my past, but rather to symbolize the new start that I, and we all, have been given.”

Her voice became stronger as she continued to speak.

“It was my choice to remove the scars from my body. I wanted to convey the message to my dark thoughts that I will not let them control my actions. I cannot change what happened to me, or what I have done. I can, however, choose how I move forward. I still have thoughts of harming myself, and I still am in shock at how my story originally ended. That story is over, and now I am going to write my own.”

The room was silent for a long moment. Yuri looked around at her friends, trying to gauge their reactions.

*Perhaps that was too much. I always overdo it. I can never find the right balance of passion and conveying information…*

Natsuki spoke up, interrupting Yuri’s thoughts.

“That’s…amazing, Yuri. I’ve always admired how thoughtful you are, and it’s clear you gave this a lot of consideration.”

Yuri nodded.

*Perhaps I did not overdo it after all.*

“Thank you, Natsuki. I’ve always admired your wit and honesty as well.”

“I really like your vision of a fresh start,” Monika added, “I think that’s something that we all needed in our own ways. Thank you for sharing that.”

Yuri smiled. “I will admit that I did fear I was oversharing. But I am always reminded by this group that the Literature Club is a place where we all can show ourselves for who we really are.”

She held up a hand. “And as far as my plans for the future, I have a business idea which I am not quite prepared to share at this time. I am also thinking about writing a novel that will be not so loosely based on our experiences.”

MC’s eyes lit up. “Ooh. That gives me an idea, Yuri. One of my side projects I’m working on is a concept for a visual novel based on our club. What if your novel was the basis for the visual novel’s script? It would be like a companion project: read the novel and then play the novel.”

Yuri considered. “That is an interesting idea, MC, particularly considering our original nature. Let’s discuss further as these ideas develop.”

“Don’t forget the manga adaptation!” Natsuki added.

Yuri sat back on the couch, smiling happily to herself. *That absolutely went well. And MC’s idea for a visual novel is quite interesting.*

“I guess that just leaves me,” Monika said, “Seeing everyone here smiling, laughing, sharing a meal together…it’s all I could have hoped for and more. We actually, really, made it to the real world. And I’m so glad to see everyone doing so well. Today I got to wear something other than my uniform for the first time. I literally cried.”

She paused for a long moment and looked down at the floor, trying to choose her words.

“I also woke up screaming early this morning.”

The group looked at Monika with surprise.

“What happened, Monika?” Sayori asked, “Did you have a bad dream?”

Monika swallowed and looked at Sayori with a miserable expression.

“I guess you could say that my nightmares are me getting what I deserve for what I’ve done. Like I said, I really like Yuri’s belief in a fresh start, but I don’t know if there is such a thing for me.”

“What makes you say that?” Sayuri asked, concerned, “Yuri is right. It’s a fresh start for

Monika shook her head. “Sayuri…you weren’t there for what I did.”

She paused again, and when she spoke next her words came out in a tone of pure anguish.

“I don’t know that I’ll ever be able to be anything other than a monster who did completely unforgivable things to her friends in pursuit of a completely insane fantasy.”

“But…,” Sayori said quietly, her expression pained at the memory of events that she tried not to think about, “We forgave you. You made things right. We’re all here now.”

Monika looked at Sayori, her eyes red.

“I know, Sayori, and you will never know how much that means to me. It was only by remembering your words that I was able to get back to sleep after the horrible nightmare that I had. But no matter what, I will always be the girl who caused her friends’ tragedies. I made those choices. It’s all my fault.”

“But if it weren’t for you contacting the FXI guys none of us would be here, right?” Natsuki said supportively, “Monika, you’re not a bad person.”

“Yes, I am!” Monika replied, her voice shaking, “If we had started the simulation over again it would have ended the same way!”

Yuri frowned, looking at Monika who sat back on the couch silently sobbing with her hand over her eyes.

*What could I possibly say? I once hated Monika for turning my mind into some kind of horrid yandere simulator. But I don’t hate her now. Perhaps we should discuss this further.*

“Monika, I continue to concur with Sayori,” she began, “We have forgiven you for what happened, but it is clear that the events that took place in our simulated world continue to deeply trouble you. But I believe we are all too fatigued tonight for a deep conversation regarding forgiveness. Would you like to discuss this further tomorrow?”

Monika looked up. “I…y-yes, I would, Yuri. Thank you. Maybe we could go for a walk around the lake outside the building in the morning.”

“Count me in, too,” Sayori added, “The Literature Club was built on support for each other.”

“That’s so incredibly kind of you, Sayori,” Monika replied, a brief hint of a smile returning to her face, “You all really are the best friends I could ever have.""

“We try,” Natsuki said with a smirk.

MC looked at his phone. “As much as I absolutely love spending time with all of you, I do have to work in the morning. I’m afraid I’m going to have to call it a night.”

Sayori yawned. “Yeah, I think I’m getting tired too. Let’s all clean up so we don’t leave Sayuri with a bunch of dirty dishes and then head to bed.”

“I’m sorry to end our night in on a downer,” Monika said apologetically as she downed the last of the wine in her glass, “I didn’t plan to come here and dump all of my feelings and fears on you all.”

“It’s okay,” Sayuri replied encouragingly as she stood to take her plate to the kitchen, “I think it was a good idea for all of us to check in. We’re all figuring out this crazy world and these new lives that we have. There’s so much to do…we haven’t even really left this building yet. Speaking of which, I’m going car shopping this weekend. Who’s coming with me?”

MC raised his hand. “I’m down. I need to go drive that Toyota Supra I saw in the lobby. What kind of car are you thinking about, Sayuri?”

“I’m not sure yet,” Sayuri replied, “I really liked that M5 that we rode home from airport in, but I think it might be too expensive.”

“I, too, would like to procure a vehicle,” Yuri added, “I will plan to join you.”

*Having my own means of transportation would be wonderful.*

“Speaking of transportation,” Monika chimed in, “We should also all go get subway cards from the station in the basement. Taking the train may sometimes be easier than driving.”

The other members of the Literature club nodded their agreement as they continued to clean up from their meal. With all of the members working together they made short order of the dishes, and soon had gathered at Sayuri’s front door to head home.

Monika held up a hand. “I like Sayuri’s idea of doing this weekly. What do you all think? Maybe we rotate among all of our homes.”

“Sounds good to me,” Natsuki concurred, “We need some time just for us. There are things that we can’t talk about with pretty much anyone else. Could you imagine trying to explain how we came into existence to someone who isn’t aware of our origins? We’d sound like crazy people.”

MC, Sayuri, and Yuri, and Sayori all added their agreement with a weekly meeting.

Sayori yawned again. “Okay…time for sleep. Thanks for hosting us tonight, Sayuri!”

Yaar, imagine this: it's a bustling Sunday morning in your Lahore flat, the aroma of fresh parathas wafting from the kitchen, and you're juggling chai cups while trying to grab that elusive masala dabba from the overhead cabinet. One wrong stretch, and bam – either you topple the spices or bang your forehead on the swinging door. Sound familiar? That's the daily drama of outdated cabinets, but enter the game-changer: [Cabinet Lift Up](https://anwerhardware.com/product-category/cabinet-lift-up/) systems. As of October 2025, these nifty mechanisms are the talk of every home renovation chat, blending German engineering with desi practicality to make your modular kitchen a true jannat. No more ladder acrobatics or dusty corners forgotten forever – these lifts promise smooth, silent access that feels like magic. Drawing from the latest buzz in hardware hubs like Hall Road and online forums, this guide spills the chai on everything from types to tips. Whether you're revamping a tiny Gulberg apartment or a sprawling Johar Town villa, a good **Cabinet Lift Up** isn't just an upgrade; it's your ticket to kitchen zen. Let's lift the lid on why these are the must-have for modern masti.

# The Rise of Cabinet Lift Up in Pakistani Homes

Gone are the days when cabinets meant clunky hinges and endless frustration – 2025's **Cabinet Lift Up** scene is all about smart living, yaar. With urban spaces shrinking faster than monsoon puddles, homeowners are ditching traditional swing doors for these upward wonders. Picture a kitchen where the upper shelves glide down to eye level, no sweat, no strain. According to recent surveys from local interior mags, over 70% of Karachi and Lahore folks swear by them for that extra ease, especially in multi-story homes where space is gold. It's not just about function; these systems add a sleek, minimalist vibe that screams 'Instagram-ready.' Brands like Blum and Häfele are flooding markets with affordable kits, starting at PKR 5,000 per unit, making it asaan even for budget builds. But why the hype? In a country where family feasts mean stacked shelves of atta and achaar, a reliable **Cabinet Lift Up** turns chaos into calm, letting you focus on the real hero: that perfect aloo gosht.

# Exploring Types of Cabinet Lift Up Systems

Diving deeper, the world of **Cabinet Lift Up** is as diverse as a bustling Sunday bazaar – from basic mechanical lifts to high-tech servo-driven stars. Let's break it down, step by step, so you can pick the perfect fit for your setup.

First up, the classic Bi-Fold Lift-Up: These darlings split the door into two panels that fold and rise like a well-rehearsed nautch girl. Ideal for narrow kitchens, they hug the ceiling without stealing counter space. Brands like Ozone offer soft-close versions with auto-holding shutters, so no slamming mid-reach for the turmeric jar. Pros? Super compact and whisper-quiet. Cons? Might need a sturdy frame for heavier loads – think 10-15 kg max.

Then there's the Stay Lift or Parallel Lift, where the entire door panel floats up parallel to the cabinet top, like a magic carpet. Perfect for wide shelves stocked with pressure cookers and pickle jars. Häfele's Stay variants use gas struts for that buttery smooth motion, and in 2025, they're touting anti-drop tech to prevent mid-air mishaps. If your kitchen's got that high-ceiling vibe in a new Islamabad build, this is your go-to – full access without the fold fuss.

For the tech-savvy souls, enter Servo-Driven Lift-Ups: These electric beauties respond to a gentle tap or wave, gliding open with zero effort. Casta's 2025 models integrate with smart home apps, so you can 'Alexa, open the spice cabinet' while your hands are full of dough. Battery-powered and whisper-silent, they're a boon for elders or anyone with back woes, but watch the price tag – PKR 15,000 upwards.

Don't sleep on Up-and-Over Systems like Blum's AVENTOS HS Top: The door arcs gracefully overhead, vanishing into a slim rail. Catalogue fresh for 2024-2025, it's all about that seamless glide for corner units, maximizing every inch. Vertical Flip-Ups round out the roster, shooting straight up for quick grabs – Cut2Size swears they're space-savers extraordinaire in tight galley kitchens.

Each type whispers a different story: bi-folds for the cozy cook, servos for the gadget guru. Measure your cabinet width (aim for 30-90 cm) and load, then match – it's that simple.

# Unpacking the Benefits: Why Go for a Cabinet Lift Up?

Ah, the real juice – what does a **Cabinet Lift Up** bring to your daily daawat prep? Let's count the wins, one by one, with a dash of real-talk from desi kitchens.

Ease of Use tops the list: No more tiptoeing like a thief in the night for that forgotten atta packet. These systems lower contents to waist height, making it asaan for kids, aunties, and everyone in between. In a 2025 Decor Cabinets report, 85% of users ditched step-stools post-install, freeing up floors for more flooring flair.

Safety First: Swing doors are notorious for head-knocks – ouch! Lift-ups eliminate that risk, keeping pathways clear and little ones safe from swinging surprises. Plus, soft-close hinges prevent finger pinches, a silent guardian in busy homes.

Space Mastery: By hugging the ceiling, they reclaim counter real estate for your coffee maker or that beloved tawa. In compact Rawalpindi pads, this means turning dead-air zones into dynamic storage – think pots, pans, and pickle pots, all within arm's reach. Aesthetics? Sleek lines and hidden hardware scream modern minimalism, ditching the dated downdraft look.

Durability and Eco-Vibes: Built with powder-coated steel and gas pistons that last 50,000 cycles, they're tough as nails. 2025 trends lean green – Blum's recyclable parts mean less waste, aligning with our push for sustainable swag in Pakistan's building boom. And for the wallet? ROI is quick – less clutter means less stress, and energy savings from efficient layouts.

One Lahore homemaker shared online: ""Installed a bi-fold last Diwali, and now my kitchen feels like a five-star setup – no more cursing the cabinets during iftar rushes!"" It's that transformative, yaar.

# Step-by-Step Installation: DIY or Call the Carpenter?

Fret not – fitting a **Cabinet Lift Up** isn't rocket science, but it does need a steady hand. Here's your no-nonsense guide, tailored for the average Pakistani DIY-er with basic tools like a drill and spirit level.

Start with Prep: Empty the cabinet, measure twice (height, width, depth – standard uppers are 30-40 cm deep). Check weight capacity; overloads spell disaster. For bi-folds, mark hinge points 5 cm from edges.

Hardware Hunt: Grab your kit from a trusty hardware store – struts, brackets, and screws included. Blum's universal mounts fit most MDF or plywood cabinets common in local mods.

Mounting Magic: Fix the lift arms to the cabinet top with screws, ensuring they're level – wonky means wobbly. Attach the door linkage, test the gas strut tension (loosen for light loads, tighten for heavy). For electrics, wire to a low-voltage adapter; no electrician needed for basics.

Final Finesse: Rehang the door, adjust stops for full open/close. A quick lube on pivots, and voila – smooth as silk. Total time? 30-60 minutes per unit. If cabinets are particleboard specials from your neighborhood carpenter, reinforce with L-brackets first.

Pro Tip: In humid Karachi climes, opt for rust-proof models. Newbies, watch YouTube tutes from Mr. Cabinetry – their April 2025 guide is gold. Or shell out PKR 2,000 for a pro install; peace of mind, after all.

# Top Picks and Trends for 2025: What's Hot in Cabinet Lift Up

October 2025's hardware scene is buzzing with innovations, so let's spotlight the stars lighting up shelves from Saddar to Blue Area.

Blum AVENTOS HK Top: The up-and-over king, with XS version for slim fits. Smooth glide, tool-free install – PKR 8,000, a steal for premium feel.

Häfele Bi-Fold Stay: Soft-close nirvana for 60 cm doors, load up to 12 kg. Their 2025 chrome finish resists fingerprints like a champ.

For smart homes, Casta's Wave-Open Servo: Gesture-activated, app-linked for inventory tracking – imagine 'low on zeera' alerts! At PKR 18,000, it's luxe but future-proof.

Local fave: Ozone's Auto-Hold Shutter – budget bi-fold at PKR 4,500, with that desi durability for monsoon-proof kitchens.

Trends? Integration with LED strips for night foraging, and modular kits for renters. George Construction predicts a 40% uptake in lift doors by year-end, thanks to open-plan kitchens.

# Maintenance and Troubleshooting: Keeping Your Lift Smooth

Like any good rishta, a **Cabinet Lift Up** needs TLC to thrive. Dust pivots monthly with a microfiber cloth – no WD-40, it gums up gas struts. For squeaks, a dab of silicone spray works wonders.

If it sticks? Check alignment; loose screws are culprits. Overloaded? Redistribute – max 10-20 kg, depending on type. In dusty Lahore lofts, vacuum vents yearly to dodge grit jams.

Battery woes in servos? Swap every 2 years; most last 5,000 opens. Warranty? Blum's 10-year cover is legend – keep receipts from your hardware wala.

One quick fix: If the door drifts down, tweak the tension cam – easy peasy, per Tallsen's guide. With care, these babies outlive trends, serving up storage smiles for decades.

# Wrapping Up the Lift-Up Legacy

From bi-fold basics to servo smarts, a solid **Cabinet Lift Up** isn't just hardware – it's the quiet revolution easing everyday epics in our homes. As 2025 unfolds with its smart-home surge, these systems stand tall, promising kitchens where function flirts with form. Whether you're a spice-hoarding auntie or a minimalist millennial, embracing one means bidding adieu to the old stretch-and-strain routine. In the end, it's about crafting spaces that flow like a well-brewed doodh patti – effortless, enduring, and utterly you.",1,1759733756.0,u_Born-Break1049,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1 - The Final Straw

Five years into our marriage, rising starlet Gianna Morrison dropped a bombshell on Instagram:

[After all the drama, it's still you! 💖]

The accompanying pic? Her and my husband, Lucas Ferguson, clinking glasses on a cruise ship, looking all kinds of cozy. The internet absolutely lost its mind that night.

Naturally, I gave the post a like, just to show I was the bigger person. Then, my DMs blew up with a tidal wave of ""OMG, are you okay?!"" and ""Sending hugs!"" from friends and family.

Shortly after, Lucas called. His voice was colder than a forgotten cup of coffee. He warned me to keep my mouth shut, that this was ""just a company thing,"" and I shouldn't read into it.

I just listened, calmly. No hysterical accusations like I used to pull, the kind that only made everyone uncomfortable.

This time, though? I was officially over him.

…

The next afternoon, Lucas finally sauntered home.

I was sprawled on the sofa, eyes closed, feeling like a zombie.

Yesterday was our anniversary. He’d promised to be home for dinner, so I’d gone all out, prepping a feast and waiting like a good little wife.

But the food got reheated until it was practically fossilized, and he never showed.

If Gianna hadn't made that whole very public spectacle, I'd probably still be playing the fool, waiting.

Lucas slumped onto the couch, sighing. ""Last-minute company thing yesterday,"" he mumbled, like it was no big deal. ""Didn't have time to tell you.""

""It was just to give Gianna some press. Don't overthink it.""

In the past, hearing his flimsy excuses would have made my heart ache, made me want to understand.

But now? I was just…done. Bone-tired. I couldn't be bothered to fight anymore.

Noticing my blank stare, Lucas frowned and pulled out a gift box.

""Didn't you say you loved that Tiffany necklace last time?""

""Got someone to pick it up for you. Try it on.""

Every time we fought, he'd pull out a gift, and I'd fall for it, thinking it meant he still cared.

This time, I didn't budge.

A flash of anger ignited in Lucas's eyes. He snatched my right hand. ""Cecelia, my patience isn't infinite. Are you done with this charade?""

I struggled to lift my head and meet his gaze. When I tried to speak, my throat felt like sandpaper, and my whole body was heavy.

Only then did Lucas register my lethargy. A fever, maybe?

His anger softened, just a smidge. Impatiently, he stalked to the kitchen and returned with a glass of water.

""Cecelia, if you can't even take care of yourself, what's the point?""

Just then, his phone on the table buzzed. The screen read: ""Gianna.""

All these years married to him, and it was always ""Cecelia."" Never anything sweet, never a pet name.

Lucas glanced over, saw me looking at the screen, and slammed the water glass down before snatching up his phone.

The gift box went flying, its contents spilling across the floor.

He shot me a suspicious look, then backed away to answer the call.

""Lucas, I’m so scared—someone’s been banging on my door nonstop.""

""Can you come check it out?""

Chapter 2 - The Unlit Hallway

Gianna's voice cracked, a delicate, tear-choked sound.

Lucas's expression did a 180. His tone softened, a quick promise to be there ASAP, a stern reminder to keep the door locked. Watching his worried face, I couldn't help a bitter laugh.

My own husband, rushing off to comfort another woman. How pathetic was I?

He hung up, turning to find me looking like a wilted flower. Guilt flickered across his face before he barked, ""Gianna's in trouble. I gotta go. Stop making a scene and take your meds.""

He probably expected me to beg him to stay. Instead, I said, ""Okay, go.""

My indifference to Gianna's plight clearly threw him. He stared for a beat, then asked, ""So I'm leaving?""

""Mm-hmm.""

I closed my eyes. His hesitation was grating. My head throbbed, and I had zero energy for this drama.

Seeing I was serious, Lucas scowled. Before he could unleash more, another call buzzed. He grabbed his stuff and bolted.

The click of the door echoed. I opened my eyes, staring blankly at the ceiling, a dull ache of disappointment settling in my chest.

I dragged myself up, downed my medicine, and crashed in bed.

Hours later, the fever had broken, but Lucas was still MIA. No appetite, so I whipped up some basic chicken noodle soup.

After washing up, I was scrolling through my phone in bed when the front door creaked open, followed by a series of ungraceful thuds.

Lucas stumbled into the room, his gait wobbly. He looked annoyed. ""Why didn't you leave the light on tonight?""

In my delusion, I used to wait up for him every night, a lamp burning just in case he tripped in the dark. Often, I'd pass out on the couch and wake at dawn.

But that was ancient history.

""Didn't I say I'd be back tonight?"" he pressed.

I glanced at him, a shrug in my voice. ""Didn't notice. Plus, why would I leave the living room light on when I'm in my bedroom?""

My attitude clearly riled him. He strode over, towering above me. ""Cecelia, pulling this 'hard to get' act won't work on me. Were all those nights you waited up just an act?""

So he knew. He'd watched me groveling for his attention, all for his amusement.

I pressed my lips together, mustering my last shred of dignity. ""Yep. I'm done pretending. You can be with whoever you want. It's not my circus, not my monkeys. If it bothers you that much, I'll happily make way for your precious Gianna.""

As a public figure, Gianna's every move was under a microscope. Her rumored involvement with Lucas, the Ferguson heir, was front-page news. Just moments ago, my feed had lit up with pics of them at a gala, fans drooling over their ""perfect match"" vibes and whispering about an engagement.

And me, his actual wife? Besides our parents and a few of his buddies, who even knew I existed?

Lucas blew up. He swiped everything off a nearby table, sending glass and ceramic shattering across the floor. ""Cecelia! I told you Gianna and I are just friends. Don't project your own insecurities onto others. Besides, you'd really give up being Mrs. Ferguson?""

""If that's what you believe,"" I said calmly, ""there's nothing I can do.""

A flicker of panic crossed his eyes before he adopted that condescending tone. ""Just behave yourself, and the title of Mrs. Ferguson will always be yours.""",1,1759733571.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Only then did Lucas register my lethargy. A fever, maybe?

His anger softened, just a smidge. Impatiently, he stalked to the kitchen and returned with a glass of water.

""Cecelia, if you can't even take care of yourself, what's the point?""

Just then, his phone on the table buzzed. The screen read: ""Gianna.""

All these years married to him, and it was always ""Cecelia."" Never anything sweet, never a pet name.

Lucas glanced over, saw me looking at the screen, and slammed the water glass down before snatching up his phone.

The gift box went flying, its contents spilling across the floor.

He shot me a suspicious look, then backed away to answer the call.

""Lucas, I’m so scared—someone’s been banging on my door nonstop.""

""Can you come check it out?""

Chapter 2 - The Unlit Hallway

Gianna's voice cracked, a delicate, tear-choked sound.

Lucas's expression did a 180. His tone softened, a quick promise to be there ASAP, a stern reminder to keep the door locked. Watching his worried face, I couldn't help a bitter laugh.

My own husband, rushing off to comfort another woman. How pathetic was I?

He hung up, turning to find me looking like a wilted flower. Guilt flickered across his face before he barked, ""Gianna's in trouble. I gotta go. Stop making a scene and take your meds.""

He probably expected me to beg him to stay. Instead, I said, ""Okay, go.""

My indifference to Gianna's plight clearly threw him. He stared for a beat, then asked, ""So I'm leaving?""

""Mm-hmm.""

I closed my eyes. His hesitation was grating. My head throbbed, and I had zero energy for this drama.

Seeing I was serious, Lucas scowled. Before he could unleash more, another call buzzed. He grabbed his stuff and bolted.

The click of the door echoed. I opened my eyes, staring blankly at the ceiling, a dull ache of disappointment settling in my chest.

I dragged myself up, downed my medicine, and crashed in bed.

Hours later, the fever had broken, but Lucas was still MIA. No appetite, so I whipped up some basic chicken noodle soup.

After washing up, I was scrolling through my phone in bed when the front door creaked open, followed by a series of ungraceful thuds.

Lucas stumbled into the room, his gait wobbly. He looked annoyed. ""Why didn't you leave the light on tonight?""

In my delusion, I used to wait up for him every night, a lamp burning just in case he tripped in the dark. Often, I'd pass out on the couch and wake at dawn.

But that was ancient history.

""Didn't I say I'd be back tonight?"" he pressed.

I glanced at him, a shrug in my voice. ""Didn't notice. Plus, why would I leave the living room light on when I'm in my bedroom?""

My attitude clearly riled him. He strode over, towering above me. ""Cecelia, pulling this 'hard to get' act won't work on me. Were all those nights you waited up just an act?""

So he knew. He'd watched me groveling for his attention, all for his amusement.

I pressed my lips together, mustering my last shred of dignity. ""Yep. I'm done pretending. You can be with whoever you want. It's not my circus, not my monkeys. If it bothers you that much, I'll happily make way for your precious Gianna.""

As a public figure, Gianna's every move was under a microscope. Her rumored involvement with Lucas, the Ferguson heir, was front-page news. Just moments ago, my feed had lit up with pics of them at a gala, fans drooling over their ""perfect match"" vibes and whispering about an engagement.

And me, his actual wife? Besides our parents and a few of his buddies, who even knew I existed?

Lucas blew up. He swiped everything off a nearby table, sending glass and ceramic shattering across the floor. ""Cecelia! I told you Gianna and I are just friends. Don't project your own insecurities onto others. Besides, you'd really give up being Mrs. Ferguson?""

""If that's what you believe,"" I said calmly, ""there's nothing I can do.""

A flicker of panic crossed his eyes before he adopted that condescending tone. ""Just behave yourself, and the title of Mrs. Ferguson will always be yours.""",1,1759733381.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

However, I’m not really sure where to start. I’m not certain if platforms like SurveyMonkey are widely used in Japan, and I’ve tried checking Facebook and LinkedIn, but haven’t had much luck finding organic leads yet (Im based in Seoul btw) 

For my part, I’m handling a survey related to IoT pay-per-use outlets (for example, secure charging stations for electronics).  
We’re looking for two full-time corporate employees from companies such as Komeda Coffee, Doutor Coffee, Tokyo Metropolitan Library, Haneda International Airport, JR East, Tokyo Metro, Narita International Airport, Mitsui Fudosan, AEON Mall, Tokyu Land Corporation, Tokyo International Forum, or any similar organizations. The participation fee is $100.

We also have another survey targeting employees working in IT firms, focusing on the use of cloud-based systems (paid ofc) 

Does anyone know any efficient platforms or communities in Japan where I can find potential respondents — ideally English-speaking (since the survey is in English, and that would save me a lot of time translating it into Japanese)?

Also, if anyone here is interested in participating, feel free to let me know — I’d be happy to check whether you qualify and can join as a respondent!",1,1759733218.0,JapanJobs,1,1.0,False

I've always gotten along better with people older than me, and we're just friends. We've known each other for several months at this point. He spends a lot of time sitting outside the coffee shop near my house. I'd seen him around a lot so I scoped him out for a while and then introduced myself to be friendly because we ran into each other often. I was not looking for a relationship or being flirty, and I don't think he ever took it that way. I just struck up a conversation to be friendly with a neighbor, basically. He has been nothing but kind to me, and has never said or done anything to make me feel uncomfortable or like he was hitting on me, etc. He's a little loud and a little socially awkward, which is fine because I'm also socially awkward, and we get along great and like to sit at the coffee shop and talk when we have time.

  
However, there is *something* about him that makes me uncomfortable. For the life of me, I can't tell you what it is, because like I said, he's been the perfect gentleman the whole time I've known him. But that little niggling feeling in the back of my brain won't go away, and it leaves me with an uncomfortable feeling every time I leave from hanging out with him. Over many years, I've learned to trust my gut on these feelings, so I'd like to distance myself from him, but I don't want to just be like, ""hey dude, you're giving me creepy vibes, delete my number, bye."" Obviously.

  
The problem is that the coffee shop is at a shopping center, right next to the grocery store that I go to, so if I ghosted him, I'd constantly run into him anyways, and that would be super awkward. I also don't really want to ghost him anyway because that's a shitty thing to do. I'm not scared of him or anything, like I don't think he's gonna hurt me, but I just hate confrontation and... how do you even explain to someone, ""Hey, it's not you, it's me, but you give me weird vibes?"" That seems so mean.

Hey folks,

Posting here again because, let’s be honest, Reddit hasn’t exactly been the most helpful cupid either, but I’m still not giving up on something meaningful.

I’m 31, 6’ tall, bearded, and slightly on the heavier side. Born and raised in Delhi, now based in Andhra Pradesh for work. I run my own HVAC spares business and am currently pursuing my degree again after dropping out of engineering years ago. Life got in the way back then, but I’ve always believed in finishing what I start.

About me:
• Emotionally intelligent, soft-spoken, ambitious, and a bit of an overthinker.
• My playlist swings from Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin to old Hindi classics and Sufi — music runs deep in me.
• I play drums, love anime, coffee, deep conversations, and quiet confidence.
• I’m an atheist but respectful of belief systems, value kindness, curiosity, and self-awareness.

What I’m looking for:
Someone funny, emotionally mature, and curious about the world. Someone who values slow conversations, consistency, and connection over performative flirting. A monogamous, meaningful bond built with patience and laughter, not pressure.

Not desperate, not rushing, just here hoping for something real.
If this resonates with you, say hi, and if not, we can just blame the algorithm 😄

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

Hey everyone 👋

I’m Rishi 23M, working as HR, currently living near Hosur but spend most weekends around Koramangala. Thought I’d give Reddit a try to see if anyone here’s looking for some genuine new friends.

I’m a bit of an introvert, so it usually takes me a little time to open up, but once I do expect long conversations, random jokes, and deep talks about life, work, and memes 😄

Not really into clubs or loud parties I prefer peaceful cafés, long drives, exploring food places, or just sitting somewhere and talking about anything and everything.

If you’re someone who’s also tired of surface-level connections and wants a real friendship, maybe a weekend coffee or a chill hangout, I’d love to connect.

No pressure, no weird vibes just good conversation and maybe a new friend in the city 😊

DMs are open!

1nzbnyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/artcollecting/comments/1nzbnyg/was_i_unreasonable_at_the_gallery/,Was I unreasonable at the gallery?,"As I was browsing in a gallery I came across an etching I was interested in.   Spoke with the gallery owner about the piece.   Ultimately I ended up in a place where I was interested in buying, but couldn’t quite shake the feeling it was a bit overpriced.   Excused myself and stepped out to get a coffee down the street, think about it, and research it a bit.  

First things that comes up is a listing at another gallery:

Same etching, #71 in the limited run (vs #132 in the gallery I was at), listed as no defects, for sale from a gallery that’s been around for 50 years and has a good reputation in this field and they only stock quality stuff.   What they describe is what you get, no questions asked return policy, etc.   I’ve bought from this gallery before, only reason I'm not at this gallery is they're about 2,000 miles away.   Overall though pieces seem very similar.  No museum curators are coming for either of them, they’re not super lower numbers n the series, etc.  They’re probably interchangeable assuming the online gallery isn’t misrepresenting condition.   

Number 71 is also 47% of the price.   1,400 vs 3,000.  Well 1,475 with shipping vs 3,000.

Also looking at this artist’s work in general, things are transacting in the 500 to mid 2,000s range depending on the piece.  While size is an imperfect comparison to use, most other etching in this size are selling in the low 2,000s.   This one is more experimental and a different subject matter which I assume is why the online gallery has it sub 2,000.

For the pricing delta my assumption was one of three things is true:

1. The gallery I am at unfortunately overpaid for this etching and cannot match the price of the other piece.
2. The gallery I am at is just pushing a high markup on the item (or when it came in they had no good comps, guessed at what to charge, have never bothered to check the market and reprice since) but there may be a number that works for both parties.  End of the day I'd rather buy local and the one I saw in person.
3. The gallery could sell it for much less and make money but they’re willing to sit on it until they get closer to 3,000.


Bonus Option ( but I doubt it): There is something clearly superior at the one in this gallery and this will be explained me when I cite the other piece and its price.  As far as I can tell this guy and the other gallery are the only two galleries currently selling any copies of this etching.  I assume if he’s consciously pricing his above the other one for reasons he’ll share those reasons.

Even so I almost don’t go back because walking and going “Hey let’s talk almost half off” to someone I’ve never done business before isn’t a great start.   But also this is a fairly apples to apples comparison in terms product.  Also for what it’s worth, the gallery I’m at mostly has stuff in the 500 to 4,000 range, with plenty of items in the high 1,000s.  Ending up in that price range would big discount for this particular item, but plenty of other items in the gallery are priced in this range.  It’s not that the 2,900 item is the cheapest one in the gallery and yet I still want a big break.

So I return and outline the basics to the owner.  I give the gallery’s name so he can pull the listing, justify his price if desired, etc.  While I’m not about to negotiate against myself I do make it clear this isn’t 1,400 or I walk out the door deal.  This is if the price can start with a 1 let's talk, if not that’s fine, it’s just business.

Guy starts walking me out the door telling me if I want to go buy a piece of art I’ve never seen before online I should just go do that and there is nothing he can do me.   Acting offended that I’d even consider the two pieces comparable, I’m an idiot at art collecting, and all but directly telling me to get out of his gallery.   

I’m curious as to thoughts on if returning and asking for that much off was a mistake to the point of being insulting and I should have just never tried.  I'm honestly torn on if I insulted him or if it was something else.  The something else being reopening an old wound by indirectly reminding him he overpaid and now either has to take the loss or sit on it until the price comes up, or he decided the best way to defend his high markup was to get offensive.",2,1759732211.0,artcollecting,1,0.6,False

The first red flag was recovery: after surgery, cats usually wake up in 2–3 hours. Coffee took almost 9 hours. We were sent home at 9 p.m. and told ""she'll wake up eventually"". and I sat with her until 3–4 a.m., checking her temperature and keeping her warm with heat packs. When she finally woke up.

We went back a couple of times for suture cleaning and medication. On 1st Oct Wednesday, I noticed discharge from her incision and rushed her back. They found pus, rinsed the wound, patched it with antibacterial gauze, and said they’d give her antibiotics and injections, but since it was 11 a.m. and posting for UG's were ending, they told me to go home and let her rest and come some other day. We trusted their word and left.

Wednesday to Sunday she was laying down and resting, but things had worsened. she was in pain every time we touched her stomach, she was drooling and peeing in a yellow colour.

I took her back on Sunday, they said it had worsened, she went back into surgery, they reopened the incision, cleaned it, and re-sutured her. I told them about the drool and the pee colour and how she had taken a long time to wake up last time. They shrugged it off, saying “it’s different for each individual. and her pee is probably since she was dehydrated”, the gave her fluids on IV and multiple injections. This time, she was under even longer: the surgery ended at 12 p.m., but she stayed unconscious until 2–3 a.m. today morning. she finally moved, but was trashing and she was crying out in pain. By 6:30 a.m., she was gone. I tried CPR and I rushed her back to MVC in 15 mins, but it was too late. 

They guessed it was multiple organ failure.

**This was medical negligence on my part** ***and*** **their part.**

I should not have waited Wednesday to Sunday, but I did not want to take another leave from work, but I was also not properly informed there and each day a different under grad student would be assigned to us asking for the history.

I want others to know free care probably means corners cut and no accountability. If you can possibly manage it, **do not go to government hospitals for surgery.** Use them for vaccines or minor checkups, not anesthesia or major procedures.

Money is tight, and I’m living paycheck to paycheck. But losing her like this hurt far worse than any bill would have. Please learn from my mistake.",150,1759731909.0,Chennai,35,0.99,False

I woke up at 5 a.m. with a severe migraine and vomited several times in the morning, including by the roadside and even at my office desk. Luckily, I had a plastic bag with me.

I went to the healthcare center at my university, where they gave me a CAFFOX tablet. I've been taking it, but it hasn't helped much. Yesterday, I visited another clinic, and the doctor there suggested directly blocking the pain. I forgot the exact name of the procedure (might be SPG). He asked me to lie down with my head hanging and used an injection and a nasal tube to administer drops through my nose. He said this method is quite effective nowadays and mentioned that he's a trained neurologist and anesthetic surgeon. He also gave me CAFFOX (which he said works better for migraines) and Celebrex.

My migraine attacks are most severe in the morning. For example, I had three episodes today, each time I woke up. The pain was more acute than ever; I don't think I've experienced anything like this before.

I used to get migraines once every 3–5 years, but when they came, they would last for weeks or even a month. I suspect it's related to climate or weather changes. I don't drink alcohol, but I do have coffee daily, at least one cup in the morning.

I tried acupuncture yesterday, but I didn’t feel much relief. I'm considering going for another session tomorrow to see if it helps.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.
