She said it makes her intolerable, and that my life would suck. I was able to talk her down and assure her that we can find a way through it, or should at least try. Yesterday she then broke up with me due to wanting space and time to figure out who she is, what she wants, etc. We were happy before this happened, and she even told me that I didn't do anything wrong. 

That being said, I'm heartbroken. I didn't text her today, but did run into her while she was heading to an exam and walked her over and had a nice conversation. I asked if she'd be willing to get coffee and sit down and talk next Friday (I think the 22nd) and she said maybe. My new plan is just to text her then so that I am not encroaching on her space as much but still contacting her. Until then, no contact.

If it wasn't obvious, I'm really hoping to get back with her, and was wondering how I should go about it. Everyone in my life says give her space and she'll come back, but at what point do I initiate contact? What else can I do? ",1,1741666255.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I recently adopted a 65lb 4m11y/o male Hound mix. He has a new-patient vet appointment on Wednesday, but after coming home from my 6 hour shift today I noticed this on his tummy.

https://imgur.com/a/uwwSFWH

https://imgur.com/a/SDihBmX

I have absolutely NO idea what it could be. My home doesn’t have many loose objects, so in my mind the only thing that would make sense would be if he jumped on the coffee table and slipped? My other thought is that he seems to be excessively itchy, so perhaps it’s an allergy - I’m planning to ask about allergy testing during his appt on Weds!

He does have separation anxiety & is on 30mg fluoxetine daily & 2 trazodone both morning & night. 

My partner is moving in shortly & he shouldn’t be alone for more than 2 hours at a time after that. In the meantime, I’ve been trying to leave him with plenty of stimulation. My shifts are never longer than 6 hours and generally range around 4 hours, and he’s seemingly okay afterwards. He’s such a sweet little angel.

I’ve been taking wellbutrin for 3-4 months now, I started with 150mg XLand by the 3rd month I started on 300mg XL.

I’ve tried SR, in the past and it made me feel like i was on adderall. I was super stimulated for a couple hours and would have a tremendous crash by the afternoon. Hence why I switched over to XL.

When I started 150mgXL, I felt it slowly making me more stable. i was still depressed, but anxiety had decreased so much so I felt normal. I wasn’t feeling very happy or motivated, but just rather average, It also helped me finish my studies and focus my attention by 40%, which to me is more than enough. I had lots of anxiety and my adhd would have me wanting to do things that brought me joy(dopamine). But with 150mgxl i can say that i felt normal.

After 3 months I decided to up my dose to 300mgXL.
I told my psychiatrist I was ready for this change because I was feeling some positive effects but not enough to really feel motivated. 
I had taken wellbutrin 2 years ago, i was on both 150mg xl and also made the switch to 300mgxl. I had to come off of it back then because I had really bad insomnia and anxiety. But I think this was due to the fact that I was drinking alcohol on weekends and having coffees. 

So this time I’m free of both alcohol and coffee. I’ve been sleeping on 150mgxl so i thought let’s try 300mgxl. I’m about 1 week and half in on 300mgxl and the first week was a charm as if nothing was happening. The second week. Now that’s where I almost quit. I started experiencing crazy anxiety or energy through my body. almost like nervous energy, i had so much of it it overwhelmed me and made my heart beat a million times faster everytime i moved. I remember that in order to calm this down, I would have to eat more. One time I barely ate and I experienced the side effects X10. I almost felt out of it, and full of anxious overwhelming anxiety and panic almost. I would walk circles around my living room to help this extra energy release. What also really helped calm it down, was magnesium. Wow, magnesium is a god given. pop 2 of them and my body would stop shaking and trembling like crazy. 
I remember regretting bumping up to 300mg because i was clenching my teeth and having face tics and i could feel my body twitching. It’s so scary. It lasted for 2 days, on the second week. By this time it was like a snap of a finger, I started to lighten up out of nowhere, and started making light hearted jokes after nervously walking around in a panic drinking gallons of water and eating bread to calm it down. I started to feel happy like a switch came on, and i was fully focused on watching a documentary about hawaii. I was contemplating going to the ER like 45 minutes ago, and all of a sudden I felt okay and my heart rate was back to normal. 

I just hope and pray I can sleep, and not have to deal with insomnia. I think that it’s very difficult to hold on and get through these insane side effects. But wow, the end of a tunnel is there if you can make it. I was about to give up. 

I made an appointment to see my psychiatrist in two days from now, to lower my dose but now i’m left with a new feeling of happiness and I want to see if I have a chance to be able to continue on it and still get my 7-8 hours of sleep. Because the past day i only slept 3-4 hours. ",1,1741665939.0,Wellbutrin_Bupropion,0,1.0,False
1j8ibim,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianstartups/comments/1j8ibim/im_trying_to_understand_the_indian_marketare/,"I'm trying to understand the Indian market—are people willing to pay a bit more for genuinely healthy and premium food products? Do you prioritize quality and long-term health, or do price concerns take precedence?","I’d really appreciate it if you could take just 2 minutes to share your thoughts.  
  
I’ve been working on a premium food product line that is 100% natural, free from artificial ingredients, and packed with real health benefits. The base ingredient we use is naturally sweet, creamy in texture, and rich in monounsaturated fats—known for heart health, weight management, and overall well-being.  
  
Since this base ingredient is expensive, my products are priced slightly higher, but they offer genuine nutritional value without compromising on taste. Here’s what I’m offering:  
  
1.\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ Protein Waffle (40g) – ₹65-70 (12g protein, vegan, no sugar, no artificial fats)  
  
2.\_ \_ \_ \_\_ \_ Nut & Peanut Butter (1kg) – ₹900-950 (30g protein/100g, completely natural)  
  
3.\_ \_ \_\_ \_ \_ \_ Chocolate Twigs (7g) – ₹20-25 (super healthy, no sugar, great taste)  
  
4.\_ \_ \_ \_\_\_ \_ Coffee Powder (12g) – ₹25-30 (strong, creamy texture, premium quality)  
  
5.\_ \_ \_\_ \_ \_ \_ Brownies (40g) – ₹120 (healthy calories, good fats, no artificial sweeteners)  
  
With healthcare costs rising, investing in good nutrition now can prevent future health issues. I’m curious to know—are Indian consumers open to paying a premium for genuinely healthy and tasty products?  
  
If you liked these products after consuming them, how often would you buy them? Would you accept them as part of your daily routine, or would you purchase them only occasionally?  
  
Please , I would love to hear your thoughts!

Let's get this over with, I say
What's wrong
Nothing
You seem off
No, let's do what I came here to do. Don't act like you care about me. 
But I do-.
No. You objectify me. I am an object of pleasure for you and you started that the day you had sex with me. When you block me, when you text me only to talk about sex. I am just here fulfilling your sexual fantasies because I want to feel praised and feel like I do something good for once. We're just using each other for our own lustful pleasures..... we're not friends. And dont pretend to be, all I am is your doll to play with. I hope after tonight I'll finally feel satisfaction and not the need to please anyone anymore because I don't think I can do this for much longer..... I just hope you remember me as the crazy girl who could sexually satisfy you. 
I... 
*Sit in silence and look at each other* 
Did you even want sex? 
No, not from the start, I had a gut feeling that it was wrong, but I did it anyways because I went for you. I know you backed off at one point, but I didn't want to make it seem like I couldn't do it. 
Did Dylan ever -?
Force me? No. But I put up with a lot for him. He was never horny so at the time that he was, I really wasn't but hey, I got sex at least, right? Even if I didn't feel like it or want to, I had to lie to myself that I was lucky to even have sex, so be grateful. 
Ash, you don't have to do that for me, if you wanted regular sex, we can have regular sex. 
Can we? After all we've talked about can we really Bailey? 
Look at me
No, you look at me and tell me you respect me, a woman, as I am, for who I am, because I know you don't. We don't even know each other. 1 night of questions doesn't count for anything. 
What do you want?
A shower.... can you..... come shower with me please? 

*guides me to his bathroom* 
I start to take off my pants, he helps by taking off my shirt. I look in the mirror in disgust of my body. I unhook my bra, he takes the rest of his clothes off and turns on the shower. 
He doesn't say anything, I tell him I gotta grab towels and he points over to the closet in the hall. I come back in and he's in the shower.
I hop in next to him 

Do you want the warm water? 
Yes, I say. I turn the dial all the way to hot. 
Why do you like it hot? 
I like to feel numb sometimes and this helps. 
Ash-
Bailey, it's okay. I'm not mad at you or anything. 
No, im sorry for making you feel the way you doing didn't mean to objectify you or anything. I like sex and I like you, but you know we gotta keep this under wraps for my relationship. 

That's the funny thing, why be in a relationship with somebody you don't love? Cause if you loved her, you wouldn't be hurting her like this. Betraying her trust, lying, sneaking around, it's not something someone would do if they loved them. 
Do you just need someone to help pay the bills ? 
What? No. I just like having someone around. 
Me too, I don't blame you. Are yall just sexually incompatible? 
Kinda, im sure she wouldn't agree to half the stuff I ask you. 
Well that's why I'm here, make sure you enjoy sex. 
 do you enjoy sex though? 
I do sometimes. Other times I do it recklessly with no thought, no care in the world. 
Has Dylan pleased you? 
Yes. 
Has he satisfied you? 
Sometimes, yes. 
Have I pleased you? 
You can try to. 
Okay, well I need to know what you like and where you want to be touched. 
I think there needs to be passion for that to be discovered. 
What do you mean?
I mean get hot and heavy with each other and then grab/kiss each other like we're never going to fuck again kinda sex. I'll tell you what I like, but I'd like you to try and figure out my ticks. 
I can try Ashley. 
*leans in to kiss me* 
I kiss back with pressure and then his mouth opens and we interlock 
As he's kissing me, he grabs my waist and pulls me closer to him. 
He pulls back, ""do you want to kiss some more?"" 
Yess.... Please....  I whisper

We soap up. Wash off and hop out the shower to his room. The rooms clean. Nothing on the floor, everythings organized. 

Why dont you lie back for me? 
I crack a smile and do as I'm told. 
He opens the bed sheets and I get in next to him. 
He props himself up on his side and kisses me. 
""You're beautiful, Ashley"" 
Thank you
Kisses me harder and touches my back lightly, I let out a moan. 
""Oh so you're sensitive, huh?"" 
Maybe ?
Mm, let's try that again. 
He kisses me like before and grazes his fingertips along my back, I moan again this time smiling while I kiss and he just leans back and says
""I knew you were a good girl"" 
I get wetter just hearing that but he stops and says
""I'd like to do more, but I want to respect you and keep you around. I like you Ashley. We don't have to have sex tonight, let's cuddle and watch a movie.""
He pulls out two hoodies and we each wear one and he puts on a halloween/fall movie. 
Im on his chest and just hear his heart beating and feel comfortable and safe.  I end up falling asleep. 

I wakeup and he's holding me. Looks like he'd been crying or something but I just look up at him and he looks down at me. I put my hand to his face and his kiss cheek. 
You don't have to tell me why you're crying, but if you want to I'll listen with no judgement or advice. 
Im okay. 
Okay. I'm here for you after all..  we are cuddling. 
Im feeling guilty and horrible. 
Okay
I dont want to lose either of you. 
I know. But you can't have both.  
But I like you both. 
I know. Shallow words fall from my mouth 
You don't have to worry about any of this right now Bailey, it's okay. Let's order some food and play some games, how's that sound? Want to take your mind off things?
Sure. 

We get out of bed and head to the kitchen. 

Can I make coffee or hot chocolate? 
Sure, it's in the pantry.

1j8hwo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingHawaii/comments/1j8hwo3/looking_for_feedback_on_kauai_honeymoon_itinerary/,Looking for feedback on Kauai honeymoon itinerary 5/7-5/14,"Thank you in advance for anyone willing to help / give feedback.  My wife and I will be in Kauai for our honeymoon 5/7-5/14 (And then Maui 5/14-5/21)  We're staying in Poipu at the Koloa Landing Resort, and definitely want to get some relaxation time in, but we also want to have some great experiences.  Here is the rough itinerary that we have for now.  I believe that I've taken into account all of the days that certain places are closed:

Weds 5/7 - Arrive, pick up rental car, hit costco for groceries / supplies, check in.  We're flying from East Coast USA, so will probably be exhausted

  
Thurs 5/8 - kalaheo cafe and coffee company for breakfast, then drive up to to the following places to wander: Koke'e State Park, Pu'u Okila Lookou, Kalalau Lookou, Waimea Canyon State Park, Waipo'o Falls Lookout, (Red Dirt Waterfall quick stop?) - **Any idea approximately how many hours to expect this to take from when we leave breakfast to when we'd head out?** Trying to figure out if we should plan more for this day. Puka Dog for dinner  


Fri 5/9 - Breakfast in our kitchen, lounge at the pool in the morning. Koloa fish market for poke, then Allerton & McBryde best of both worlds guided tour. Makauwahi Cave short hike. Is there another good area for a relaxed hike around here? Clean up at our room, stop at koloa kenji burger for dinner, then check out hanapepe art night sometime in the 5-8 window.  Hypothetically, if it was a long day and we got to hanapepe art night close to say 7pm, would it be winding down heavily at that point?

Sat 5/10 - Breakfast in our kitchen, Kauai backcountry adventures mountain tubing (already booked, 9am-1pm), kauai juice company / find somewhere for lunch if we're still hungry after what the tubing trip feeds us. Back to room. Make a reservation at beach house restaurant a few weeks out for a dinner at sunset?

Sun 5/11 - North Shore Day.  **This is what I'm the most unsure about, because I want us to make the most of our one day driving up to the north shore.**  Kalalea Juice Hale for breakfast when we get up there 8:30ish am.  Is it realistic to hope to both snorkel in Hanalei Bay, and also make 11 am reservations at Ha'ena state park with plans to hike the 2 mile kalalua trail to Hanakapi beach to take in the sights before turning around?  Is it even realistic to snorkel on the north shore in May, or would it likely be too rough?  Not sure what else we should plan to do or see in Ha'ena state park, especially if the Kalalua trail is not safe that day because of rain.  We also had a stop by the Maniniholo dry cave on our list for this day.  Dinner at Tahiti Nui Bar.  Are we missing any must see or do things in the North Shore?

Mon 5/12 - Morning snorkel at Poipu beach or another nearby beach, or lounge at pool if conditions aren't good. 12pm ukulele lesson at our resort is booked, but we can nix this if necessary.  (I'm a musician and would love to jam and chat with the teacher) After ukulele lesson, head to old koloa town, koloa fish market for lunch, shops at kukui'ula, Lappert's ice cream and coffee.  HoloHolo Grill (Resort restaurant, we have resort credit to use) for dinner. 

Tues 5/13 - Wailua River Kayak to secret falls, thinking this would take 4-5 hours? Jojo's shave ice at some point. No plans for dinner.

Weds 5/14 - Early flight to Maui, waking up and leaving

Any recommendations on snorkel gear rental?  Any recommendations on the kayak rental for wailua river.

A few things that just didn't seem to fit logistically into our itinerary in a way that made sense and allowed us to relax and take advantage of the pools at our resort:

\*Renting bikes and riding the Ke ala Helen Makalae Path  
\*Mark's place for a lunch  
\*Kauai Bakery for desserts

\*We are not looking to do a helicopter tour or a napali coast boat tour

Any and all feedback is welcome, as are recommendations for activities and good food / poke.  Seems like the Koloa Fish market gets mentioned a lot for the poipu area.

Ramadan Kareem, I hope everyone’s Ramadan has been going good so far and may all your fasts and dua’s get accepted. 
I’ve had made this certain dua for years and it is for my dad. He has the most negative mindset he won’t barely let us do anything besides go grocery shop. What do I do to make this dua come true??? I’ve tried everything, sometimes I think I’m just praying wrong or Allah doesn’t want to listen to this specific dua. 

I’m a 20 (F) turning 21… whenever I want to leave the house I almost never go by myself I always tell my dad I’m taking my younger sister or my 19 yr old brother with me. Over the years, he’s just gotten worse and worse with going out, it feels like oppression. I’m trying so hard to fight for my brother to have him go to our local mosque’s boy gatherings, lectures. They’re having suhoor this weekend at a restaurant that’s 5 min away from my house. When my mom and I were talking about he was like there’s food at home we can eat anything. I was like sometimes it’s not about the food. It’s Ramadan, the boys want to gather, chat, hang out , socialize. He was like yeah it’s so dangerous someone can just come and shoot up the place like that, I was like you have to stop thinking that way and he responds with yeah mhm not think that way huh, so when something bad happens you guys yell al-wayl… he then proceeds to bring up an very minor car accident from 2 yrs ago how i used to skip Fridays at school and that one Friday I went I got into a car crash. Another thing is my siblings and I got invited to a Iftar at my college, 5:30- not dark, we asked and he proceeded to say no. Ik other people have it worse and I’m thankful I have my parents alive but I’m just so sick and tired of living this way. I wish my mom and us had the chance to go out, see the world. In my 20 yrs of living I’ve never been to the most well known city in our state besides ONCE, people think I’m crazy when I say that. I have prayed over and over, forget me I’m a women so I can’t go out , can’t hang out….. but my brother… he turns 20 this year!!! Shouldn’t he have the right to go out and socialize every now and then. He’s literally not maturely developed and he doesn’t speak well like boys his age. He sounds like a 14 year old sometimes because he only goes out like every now and then and barely socializes with people. I know marriage isn’t the way to freedom but as much as I hate the idea of it, I honestly think that is the way to freedom. I literally try so hard fighting and talking over and over again. I literally get scared I can’t lie I can’t go out and say I have school to hangout with my Muslim friends say at a coffee shop because he implemented the idea of “if your somewhere you shouldn’t be and you get a car accident, than this this and that.” I understand parents’ fear upon their kids, but i know a lot of people that have the most religious parents, they fear, but they don’t cross the line, they allow them to live a life, enjoy school events, allow them to participate in like a school club or sport.

I understood who she was, and we had a casual chat about her studies, my career that sort of stuff. 

After a few minutes she said she was feeling sleepy as she was fasting and it was early in the morning, I was also feeling tired from not sleeping the night before so l let her rest and then put on my headphones and drifted into sleep listening to music. 

Both of us slept through the entire train ride and once it reached kottayam we both deboarded.

That evening I opened instagram and searched for her name but couldn't find her ID. I even searched through my sister's followers, but couldn't find her.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I see that most recipes for coffee, chocolate, and other ingredient named bitters tend to be somewhat complicated recipes that include spices and bittering agents such as gentian. 

Are there important reasons to avoid making purer flavor extracts, for example just coffee and a spirit, instead of including spices and gentian? Must things such as coffee and chocolate bitters/extracts include bittering agents such as gentian and chincona for balance or some other reason?

This whole thing is really revealing my ego - but it's just been so rapid - it's shocking.

  
For me it started with a painful / itchy scalp. A TON of stress in my life, very little sleep, stuck in fight / flight 24/7. Hair started shedding, then itchiness / pain became more transitory. Over time all of my healthy thick hairs have been replaces with thin brittle strands - hairline has receded too.

  
Now if I drink too much coffee, my scalp will start to itch and hairs will fall on my laptop.

Symptoms:
Dizziness 
Nausea 
Anxiety 
Tingling on left hand middle finger & ring sometimes
Heart palpitations
Cough
Tingling on sides of head but not really any headaches
Funny feeling on left side of chest (mostly while anxiety is happening or shortly after)
Stuffed nose at night (kinda normal for me)
Diarrhea off and on been fine the last few days 

Health conditions 

Asthma (mild)
-Lacoste intolerant
-Moderate allergies to dust mites 
-Stubborn ingrown toe nail that's been bugging me for a year left big toe

Backstory:

Relatively healthy 31 year old so far other than back pain under the shoulder blade the last 10 years. Didn't follow through with chiropractor and put it off (got another referral im going through with it this time)

Age 31
Height 5'7 
Weight 235 
Smoker - No
Drinker - Yes usually 2 times a week 6 beers for roughly the last 5 years 1 year sober 2020 and heavier drinking from 21 to 25.

I've had some health problems the last 6 months starting with accidently inhaling e6000 glue on a Halloween mask for a few minutes. I went to the hospital that night with high anxiety thinking the worst but my blood and urine were fine as well as a EKG. Felt better after a few days and no more anxiety which before this I rarely got. 2 months pass by and while driving out of town I felt dizzy and a bit anxious so my pregnant wife had to take over later on in the day I felt fine driving. Then after just after new years I was diagnosed with Pityriasis Rosea which was very itching mostly on my chest. Jan 9th my son was born I was still itchy but it went away after 3 weeks. Then Feb 1st I got regular sick with a mucus cough that was producing a lot of phlem that a few times had a little red in it. Feb 7th went out of town again for dinner while still coughing a bit and again dizzy with anxiety while driving my wife had to drive us back home after dinner. Felt fine the next day. Feb 14th went out of town for Valentine's Day dizzy again with anxiety we stayed (2hr drive) the night at a hotel was fine the next morning and I drove home fine. The day after Feb 16th I went to a store while in the store I felt lightheaded and had to carefully drive home then that night felt anxiety dizziness and nausea into the next day this time getting worried so I went to the hospital Feb 18 at 1am. They  did the same tests again every fine. The next morning I scheduled a DR appointment got in the same day and they said my vitamin D was low and my EKG the night before showed a heart palpitation. The only other thing not normal was a little high cholesterol and slightly elevated liver enzymes.
Dr ordered a CT scan on my head and wanted me to have a holter monitor just to rule stuff out (CT was clear with just Moderate mucosal thickening right maxillary sinus I'm currently having trouble getting the holter monitor). I have a Nival extra cranial bilat scheduled for tomorrow afternoon. I was prescribed a high amount of vitamin D I take once a week for 8 weeks. I was also prescribed atarax for anxiety and zoftan with mezicline for nausea dizziness. The nausea and dizziness went away after a week then I was mostly fine from Feb 22 to 28. On the 29th I started having moderate anxiety mostly at Night and bad insomnia with loss of appetite at dinner time. The loss of appetite at night lasted 3 days at now it's fine. Went to the DR again this last Friday let him know the dizziness and nausea mostly is gone but now I have anxiety at mostly night and insomnia. Was prescribed buspar which helps a bit and trazodone which I've only taken once so far since it said I can't mix them but it helped a bit when I took it for insomnia. Said to check in with him in two weeks and we'll go from there. Still have a cough since the first of February but now its dry. Side note Dr said my cholesterol is a little high for my age but weight loss and better diet would help (I want to lose weight but only after I figure out what's wrong with me so it doesn't get masked as a potential sickness for anything else where weight loss is a symptom). I stopped drinking alcohol and coffee since Feb 14th. Another possibility is celiac disease my sister has it and I did a blood test for it on Friday but the results havent come back yet. Not sure if this is relevant but my house gets mold frequently we try to keep up on it. I know this was a long post but any help would be greatly appreciated as I want to get back to normal it's been really stressful on me but also my wife dealing with our newborn she goes back to work in a month and i feel like I'm letting her down because I'm not able to help as much as I would like because if I get up at night I won't go back to sleep from insomnia or anxiety so she's been shouldering the load at night and she's amazing it's making me a bit depressed. I've explained all this to her and she is a huge support but gets upset that I look on here at syptoms and get my self worked up with anxiety thinking the worst which gets me worried about my wife losing me and  my 3 beautiful kids losing their father I love them all so much and want to see them grow up and have children of their own.

1j8hglx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1j8hglx/girlfriend_spending_too_much/,Girlfriend spending too much,"I (36m) have been dating my (35f) girlfriend for almost a year. She has a 10 y/o daughter from a previous relationship and I spend a lot of time with them both. I've even taken the daughter out for ice cream etc while my girlfriend gets her hair/nails done. 
For context, my girlfriend lives at home with her parents, though they are hardly home as they both work a lot. 
I have my own place but need to move soon, and we are considering living together, though we need to be engaged before that happens, as she wants a certain degree of commitment before living together, due to her daughter. 

Since we started dating, I've noticed my girlfriend spends a lot of money. She spends money on things for herself, such as makeup and other beauty products, getting her hair and nails done, clothes for herself, designer things like purses, wallets, perfumes etc, and buys a ton of stuff on Amazon. Since we started dating, I've assembled two long nightstands, two shoe racks, two dressers, a TV stand for a new TV she bought, a coffee table for the TV, an exercise machine amongst other stuff. In addition, she has bought a bunch of stuff for her daughter, including clothes, gifts, an air hockey table, etc. She also spends a lot of money on ordering food through food ordering services like GrubHub, as well as subscription services. 

I don't know exactly how much she makes, but I can make a guess based on her occupation. And she does work two jobs, albeit the second job is only on weekends. 

While I do acknowledge that she lives at home and pays cheaper rent and also doesn't have a car payment, and I do give her credit for being a hard worker and providing for her daughter, and doesn't ask me for help with that stuff, the spending does concern me. 

When we first met, she mentioned prior to us dating that she was talking to a realtor about buying a house for her and her daughter. She said that would change if we started dating because the house she was in the market for wouldn't be big enough for the 3 of us. 

A little bit of background about me.
I don't make a lot of money and am in the process of trying to pay off credit card debt. She also mentioned the last guy she dated made a lot of money (like $200,000 a year) and always bought her nice things, took her out places, took her on vacation etc... which obviously makes me feel insecure and inadequate. 

I have no idea how to approach this with her. I know she's an amazing woman. She's gorgeous, smart, hardworking and a great mother, and I know that she loves me very much. And I know that her finances are not really my business. Although I'm very upfront and open with her about my finances, and she knows about my credit card debt, she isn't as open with me about hers. 

My concern is that I don't want to become more serious and get engaged or even married and have financial problems down the road. I don't make enough money to support the two of us and her daughter and allow her to spend the kind of money she does and not contribute. 

She has mentioned in the past that she doesn't believe relationships should be 50/50 especially when you factor in things like cooking, childbirth, childcare etc. 

Ultimately, I'm just looking for advice on how to approach this in a way that doesn't sound like I'm  being nosey, condescending, judgmental or any other negative way. 

I would like to discuss this with her in an open, positive and constructive manner, where she understands my concerns and will be receptive to me and work together toward a solution. I want her to know that she and her daughter are both important to me, and I love them both very much. And I just want to have a healthy relationship. 

My therapist mentioned I should write down my concerns and try to organize my thoughts before speaking with her, but I think I really could use some advice from people who may have been in a similar experience. 

I'm sorry for the very long post, but it's hard for me to get my thoughts organized and concise. Thank you all in advance, I really appreciate the time and consideration. ",3,1741663051.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1j8heye,https://www.reddit.com/r/brandnew/comments/1j8heye/for_the_folks_coming_to_the_newport_ky_show/,"For the folks coming to the Newport, KY show","For the folks coming to Newport, KY for the show:

I live a hop, skip, and jump away from Megacorp and while my wife, my two cousins, and I unfortunately couldn’t score any tickets, I did want to at least share some recommendations for those who did and are visiting this lovely part of Kentucky.

Of the three cities Brand New is playing in, I reckon Newport is by far the least known. You could easily stay for the weekend and find a ton to do. Newport itself may not have a whole weekend’s worth of things to do, but the surrounding cities, namely Cincinnati, definitely do.

Here are some things to do while in town:

### Try Cincinnati style chili
This is a given. Every “what to do in Cincinnati” article ever written since the internet existed will mention this. It’s a local favorite, most people will recommend Skyline, but you really can’t go wrong with most spots that serve it. I personally think folks coming to town should hit up the Dixie Chili on Monmouth Street about a half mile from Megacorp. It’s open until 2am and gives that old school diner feel. Try the Alligator with chili, be nice to the late night folks working, and enjoy yourself.

### Check out the riverfront
Megacorp is about a Joe Burrow throw from the Ohio River. The bridges and riverside walkways are some of the most pleasant places to walk. Newport has the levee, and the Purple People Bridge that crosses into Cincinnati. The 4th Street bridge into neighboring Covington is admittedly a little sketchy (tight paths, broken concrete), but cross it and you get to check out some of the most historic homes in the region along the riverfront. Cross the Roebling, aka the Brooklyn Bridge’s predecessor, into Cincy and check out the riverfront there. Lots of green space, benches, etc. Some folks may enjoy the Banks area, it’s more of a college kid scene. If you’re an old millennial like me, you may be more apt to check out either Mt Adams in Cincinnati (Blind Lemon might be the coolest bar in a 20 mile radius), or just stay on the KY side and check out one of the many hole-in-a-wall joints in Newport and the neighboring KY cities. 

### Hit up the local record stores
Jet Age Records is on Monmouth in Newport, also about half a mile from Megacorp, and has a selection of local acts, and serves coffee. Shake It Records in Northside (about 15 minutes north of Newport) is my personal favorite, and is next door to one of my favorite diners, Blue Jay. If you want to explore a bit more around town, Everybody’s Records and Morrow Records are all within about a 15 minute drive of Newport.

### Enjoy a stein and pretzels at Hofbrauhaus

This spot is also a half mile or so from Megacorp. If the weather is nice, they have a ton of outdoor patio seating. Beer is delicious, pretzels are great. Even if you’re not into beer, the vibe there is usually pretty laid back and easy going. Mix of families, college kids, older folks, etc. all hanging out drinking lagers in steins and enjoying Bavarian grub.

### Explore the surrounding cities

There’s a ton to do in the surrounding cities. Cincinnati obviously has loads of things to do - free art museum, tons of little neighborhoods with their own character, the Union Terminal which was the inspiration for the Hall of Justice, OTR and the bar scene, dozens of breweries. Google is your friend for Cincinnati. On the KY side, the immediate surrounding cities of Covington and Bellevue have their own thing going on but your mileage may vary depending on interests. Bellevue is a charming town, mostly frequented by locals, but out-of-towners may enjoy hitting up an underrated brewery Darkness Brewing. Covington has a lot more variety, Google is your friend there too. If you’re looking for a view of the city, then Devou Park in Covington is your best bet.

I hope this helps someone’s trip! NKY is a neat little spot, generally unlike the rest of the state with exception to maybe Louisville. It’s still wild to me that Brand New somehow ended up here on this mini-tour. I hope all the folks coming in from out of town enjoy themselves! My wife and I might check out the scene outside the venue on the day of the show to see if anyone has some tickets they’re willing to part with so we can join y’all :)",10,1741662903.0,brandnew,2,0.92,False

It also makes me feel like an imposter sometimes because Vyvanse doesn’t seem to work for me the way it does for others. Everyone talks about how it helps them focus and function better, but for me, the experience is rough. The going up phase is horrible, and when Vyvanse is at its peak, that’s actually when I feel the worst—more anxious, unsettled, just not right. But weirdly, as it starts to come down, I feel a little better. There’s this sense of peace and even a bit of hopefulness that I don’t get during the peak.

If you’re on a very low dose, how do you manage it? Do you split your dose, take breaks, or use any strategies to balance the effects? I’d love to hear your experience!",2,1741662461.0,VyvanseADHD,3,1.0,False
1j8h9av,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDoctorSmeeee/comments/1j8h9av/help_need_answers_for_my_symtoms_high_anxiety/,Help need answers for my symtoms (High anxiety),"Hello all,

31 year old male seeing if anyone has similar symptoms to me and trying to find the cause.

Symptoms:
Dizziness 
Nausea 
Anxiety 
Tingling on left hand middle finger & ring sometimes
Heart palpitations
Cough
Tingling on sides of head but not really any headaches

Backstory:

Relatively healthy 31 year old so far other than back pain under the shoulder blade the last 10 years. Didn't follow through with chiropractor and put it off (got another referral im going through with it this time)

Age 31
Height 5'7 
Weight 235 
Smoker - No
Drinker - Yes usually 2 times a week 6 beers for roughly the last 5 years 

I've had some health problems the last 6 months starting with accidently inhaling e6000 glue on a Halloween mask for a few minutes. I went to the hospital that night with high anxiety thinking the worst but my blood and urine were fine as well as a EKG. Felt better after a few days and no more anxiety which before this I rarely got. 2 months pass by and while driving out of town I felt dizzy and a bit anxious so my pregnant wife had to take over later on in the day I felt fine driving. Then after just after new years I was diagnosed with Pityriasis Rosea which was very itching mostly on my chest. Jan 9th my son was born I was still itchy but it went away after 3 weeks. Then Feb 1st I got regular sick with a mucus cough that was producing a lot of phlem that a few times had a little red in it. Feb 7th went out of town again for dinner while still coughing a bit and again dizzy with anxiety while driving my wife had to drive us back home after dinner. Felt fine the next day. Feb 14th went out of town for Valentine's Day dizzy again with anxiety we stayed (2hr drive) the night at a hotel was fine the next morning and I drove home fine. The day after Feb 16th I went to a store while in the store I felt lightheaded and had to carefully drive home then that night felt anxiety dizziness and nausea into the next day this time getting worried so I went to the hospital Feb 18 at 1am. They  did the same tests again every fine. The next morning I scheduled a DR appointment got in the same day and they said my vitamin D was low and my EKG the night before showed a heart palpitation. Dr ordered a CT scan on my head and wanted me to have a holter monitor just to rule stuff out (CT was clear having trouble getting the holter monitor). Was prescribed atarax for anxiety and zoftan with mezicline for nausea dizziness. The nausea and dizziness went away after a week then I was mostly fine from Feb 22 to 28. On the 29th I started having moderate anxiety mostly at Night and bad insomnia with loss of appetite at dinner time. Went to the DR again this last Friday let him know the dizziness and nausea mostly is gone but now I have anxiety at mostly night and insomnia. Was prescribed buspar which helps a bit and trazodone. Said to check in with him in two weeks and we'll go from there. Still have a cough since the first of February but now its dry. Side note Dr said my cholesterol is a little high for my age but weight loss and better diet would help (I want to lose weight but only after I figure out what's wrong with me so it doesn't get masked as a potential sickness for anything else where weight loss is a symptom). I stopped drinking alcohol and coffee since Feb 14th. Another possibility is celiac disease my sister has it and I did a blood test for it on Friday but the results havent come back yet. Not sure if this is relevant but my house gets mold frequently we try to keep up on it. I know this was a long post but any help would be greatly appreciated as I want to get back to normal it's been really stressful on me but also my wife dealing with our newborn she goes back to work in a month and i feel like I'm letting her down because I'm not able to help as much as I would like because if I get up at night I won't go back to sleep from insomnia or anxiety so she's been shouldering the load at night and she's amazing it's making me a bit depressed. I've explained all this to her and she is a huge support but gets upset that I look on here at syptoms and get my self worked up with anxiety thinking the worst which gets me worried about my wife losing me and  my 3 beautiful kids losing their father I love them all so much and want to see them grow up and have grandchildren.

Kids:

2 month old boy (my little mini me)
8 year old girl (my princess)
13 year old girl (my drama queen)

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j8h351,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1j8h351/dont_get_discouraged/,Don't get discouraged,"Last year, I struggled to find a job for a while. Eventually, I took a seasonal contract at a warehouse/distribution center for three months, from October to December. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. Even now, I still feel the echoes of that experience in my legs. But that job changed me. It taught me that I have nothing to complain about, whether in life or work. No matter what struggles I face, there are always people in tougher situations. That realization broadened my perspective, made me more grateful, and humbled me in ways I never expected.

While working that seasonal job, I never stopped applying for security positions. Rejection after rejection came, but I refused to quit. Then I saw a casual security position open up and applied. I always tailored my resume and cover letter for every job, and this time was no different. When I got the offer, I had no idea where I was about to work. The moment I stepped in, I realized I had entered a completely different world, a high-status company with a breathtaking view of the city, top-tier lounges, coffee machines on every floor, and an atmosphere of excellence.

I didn’t try to impress anyone, I just worked. I stayed alert, made it my mission to lighten my coworkers’ load, and focused on bringing value. And people noticed. My work ethic spoke for itself. Even though I was just a casual employee, I knew deep down that I was meant to be there. Sure enough, they saw what I brought to the table and offered me a full-time position. I’ve been working here for a month now, and the environment is completely different, my coworkers make me laugh all day, something I never thought I’d find in a job. My situation did a complete 180, and now I’m in a position that, for now, feels like a dream job.

People call it luck. They think opportunities just fall into your lap. But that’s not how it works. There’s no magic wand that hands you the perfect job. It’s about willpower, the will to keep going no matter what, the will to push forward even after endless rejection, the will to rise even when you feel broken. And I know what that feels like, whether in a job search or in life.

When a glass shatters into a thousand pieces, some see it as broken. But to me it's not broken, it becomes sharp, dangerous, something not to be messed with, you are never broken, it's just a steping stone to becoming who you are meant to be. Fortified and reforged.

1j8h2cl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1j8h2cl/my_bestfriend_and_my_girlfriend/,My bestfriend and my girlfriend,"Heyy everyone I am 26 (M) and my gf 23


This is a 3 year long story and I don't believe I will be able to put it all up here but I wanna paint the closedt picture possible.
I had a bestfriend that I used to consider like a brother to me and one day I ran into him when I was having coffee with a female friend which led eventually to a group of friends forming and he grew closer to that female friend of mine which a month or so later became my girlfriend and that was the beginning of the chain of dedtruction.

It was her first serious relationship so I cut her some slack thinking that I would be able to explain myself to her and we will adjust to be fine but the problem. She was, let's just say too comfortable with my bestfriend to the point she would hug the guy infeont of me, they had a marriage backup plan infront of me ( if they aren't married by the age they are 30 or 35 they'll marry each other).

She was making all of these things and more which I kept making just remarks about at first without making any scene because she just says "" yes I understand perfectly I am really sorry about that"" So at first I didn't feel the need to be persistent but I kept seeing her doing the same things and when I bring them she tries to manipulate facts like no that's not how it happened etc...and then says sorry I understand and I will stop doing this or that but I kept seeing her having him as her to go to guy with every problem every subject she's just calling him sharing to him and when I had a fight with her about this subject the moment we hang up she just went to him to talk about it

Things just kept going south with the main themes being and I addressed the subject with him, he didn't back off and neither did she and eventually I left the group of friends we had I stopped going, I left club cinema cuz' they were both in it( I understand that it was a dumb thing to do since I loved that club ama these ppl meant alot to me and I hoped that such drastic decision menny would make them understand that I am not comfortable with the situation which I kept saying ) it didn't work... 


Things kept getting worse she was meeting him behind my back( I didn't know that at the time... believe it or not I am still discovering things that happened two and three years ago) so I gave her the ultimatum..he's not my friend anymore, he's your bestfriend now it's either me or him.. I am old school and I want your emotions more than anything I can't be in a relationship in which u r choosing a different guy to be your safeplace and this guy is being fake I swore to her that I know he doesn't have good intentions since he is the same as me, ri9 guy bestfriend w female bestfriend ma net9ablouhesh but she didn't believe me. She thought I was just trashtalking him to get her to stop talking to him. 
Eventually she said I choose you after a month or so of intense fights.

After that I had a feeling that something is off especially that I know she's been lying to me for a year or so so I didn't believe her.
We didn't get any better with him out of the picture.. same old problems same old lies. She never cheated me with any guy I am sure but she keeps doing stuff that is too close to that situation. For instance, she had tinder installed on her phone and she actually started up a conv with a guy and they moved the conv to messenger but she came clean a month later or so saying that she just did that cuz' she wanted to make new friends( yeah...why make friends on tinder? Ena bidi menish fehm)


Such things kept happening with the intensive amount of lies and I had became this angry guy with trust issues and ""over""thinking every single thing she says does or implies and guess what I am almost always right at my conclusions but I never have actual proof so she denies it tooth and nail and we have fights for weeks over one subject until I have no fight left in me and months later I discover one way or another that she was lying. A few months later I was already filled with this gut feeling that she isn't being honest with me and so I went through her phone it was squeaky clean no weird convos no nothing but one thing in a conv with a girlfriend of hers she sent her a picture 3 months prior of her with the bestfriend she told me she stopped talking to a year before in which she was redting her head on his shoulder...At this point I was blamed by everyone that I am being an angry guy with her so I was really calm sat her down showed the pic in the conv and asked what's this and she was acting as if it's not a big deal "" chfiha tasswira menish fehma"" she kept repeating that and the calm guy tapped out leaving the angry guy...an ugly one sided fight followed by a week of slience followed by a meet up I requested in which I broke up with her and during which SHE asked to remain in touch in any way even as fwb and I refused saying that I don't wanna do that to her.. we eneded it there. 

A few weeks after that she reached out just saying heyy did u delete our ""pics"" I said no I didn't and she kept saying I have to delete them to which I kept saying no I will delete them when I want to which she kept blaming me of blackmailing her with those pics ( keep in mind I refused to be fwb...why would I blackmail her for :) ) and then she blocked me...I couldn't get over her we weren't talking but I was thinking about her daily until she reached out a month or so later and we got back in touch and got back together...

 And I discovered that since the day she told me she stopped talking to the guy she had a fake account made just to talk to him that's why her phone was squeaky clean( keep in mind she wasn't cheating she just insisted on keeping touch with the guy because, and I'm quoting her he's like the brother she never had and he sees her like his sister )...


For the millionth time she says she stopped talking to guy but I didn't believe it...it took alot more of her lying and plotting with HIM to fool me into believing that they did stop talking that I saw through bla bla but eventually I found out that she actually stopped talking to him cuz' he finally decided to make the move and ask her out...

the story with him is over now but at what cost I am drained and unable to trust her word..she keeps asking for a chance and I keep providing her with them and she keeps lying left and right and when she has this great ability to take a simple conversation that has the purpose of seeing what went wrong and avoiding it in the future and turn it into this 3 week long fight cuz' she would rather keep lying and twisting events and I don't know how to deal with this.

She blames me for her lies sometimes saying that she's scared of losing me that's why she never can be honest and other times she's scared of my reaction znd how it would make her feel...تبا

There are more instances and wayyyyy more details but this the short story of a 3 year relationship and the problem is I still love her and I hate myself because of it...

I never got to this point before and the amount of lies and the plotting behind my back that happened that killed the trust, I have never lived them before with anyone and never allowed anyone the room to mess up this much w nab9a m3aha but here I am asking for fresh pov's..what is left to do? What other approach should I try knowing I tried everything from straight controlling ( u will do this end of discussion) to giving her the space by seeing a lie and having proof and giving her time to come clean by herself and weeks maybe months later decide that enough is enough and go ask her to be 100% honest and promising her that I will definitely forgive anything she will tell me and won't even blame her for it and she tells me 30% of the story with some modifications to make herself look better...

I know the best option for both of us is to end this once and for all and get on with our lives and I know it should have happened a long time ago ..it didn't 

I am tired...any advice on what I or we could do to make things work better would be welcome

I said something on the lines of ""if ur ever in nyc, coffee on me"" and man goes ""I'm straight but thanks for the offer"". BRO WTF why did u think I was flirting with you. I was so confused for like 5 whole minutes. We literally had a convo about maintaining a bulk over the summer. At what point did he think I had any interest in him. He then just ghosted my text lol. 

Stuff like this makes me feel like shit as if I did something wrong or made someone uncomfortable. I think I was taken aback because I have mostly straight male friends and they've never acted weird like this. Do influencers think everyone wants to fuck them? Bruh

Update:

I sent him this:
""bro I'm a fan of ur stuff but the fact you think all ur followers are horny gay guys is low-key weird on ur part. Just don't act like that to other people that respond to ur stories. Just saying lol""
He responded with:

I’ll try to make it short but I really need answers or ideas about my condition it would be much appreciated :)
20M and I live in Canada.
When I was 2 years old, I got infected by a bacteria called fusobacterium which gave me issues in my ears and I got prescribed antibiotics for 3 months long.
Then, no issues since 13 when I started to suffer from halitosis or even before but that’s probably at this age things got worse. I did not make a big deal of it since I got 18 when it was just too much for me to live with. I had post nasal drip so the doctor gave me corticosteroids and it helped me a bit about my halitosis and my sleep but the problem was still there. And I tried with different medications again and again without any good results. I got a sinus scan which revealed nothing important except a little inflammation in my sinus. Then, my family doctor tried to make me pass a breath test for the bacteria h pylori which I had in apparently a big amount in my stomach. Got under antibiotics (amoxicillin and tetracycline) with ppi. The huge relief on my halitosis was shocking. Not perfect but much much better. I stopped taking antibiotics and everything got bad again about my breath and I felt like I had real stomach issues like a burning sensation or even huge pain in my gut going down to my testicles. I got ppi’s again (dexlansoprazole) and it definitely helped which gave me the opportunity to keep working and having a kind of life but I couldn’t eat any tomatoes, sugar, greasy food or having alcool or coffee which gave my huge lpr and stomach aches. And I had diarrhea every vegetable (fibers) I would ate. There I am now after 3-4 months of ppi everyday after a gastroscopy I just got. Results are several ulcers in my stomach and my duodenum which I got a biopsy for. The thing is that apparently an ulcer should disappear after a maximum of 2 months of ppi and it’s already been 4 months i am taking them. 

Other symptoms if that can helps:
-dandruffs (hair, eyebrows and beard)
-redness around my nose with kind of skin that falls off from there
-acne 
-fart odour significantly different and body odour significantly different from time to time
-migraine

So here’s everything, tell me everything you think of. Even though it seems to make no sense, I’m trying to get into medicine school and I love that field so I’ll read everything with pleasure.

I stumbled upon Ascaso machines when deciding between Lelit machines and I feel in love.

I’d like to understand the difference between the machines that would help me make a decision based on my workflow.
My budget is 1800 for a coffee machine + grinder. I don’t want to single dose. I prefer to use the hopper and make the process as streamlined as possible for me and especially my partner (with weight under espresso cup ofc). We mostly drink milk based drinks, 1 or 2 at the same time. Medium-dark roast.

As for my questions:
- Is the steaming power in Uno that bad as people on YouTube say? Making it worth spending extra few hundred euros on Duo?
I don’t mind waiting a minute for heating to the steaming mode as I’ll do the cleaning and prep work.

- is the PID in a thermoblock machines worth the €250 in price increase? 
(I’m asking because the money save would go towards eureka mignon libra over specialita, as it’s less hassle do dial in).

I went the ""traditional"" route first, and I did everything right. 

I picked the girl who, honestly, was not a Victoria Secret model but who had an amazing smile, was religious and stable. We agreed that she would stay home, and she did. We had the standard two kids together with a white picket fence. 

Mind you, I was a white guy working in tech in the 90s and early 2000s. I did find more than reasonable amounts of success, but it was not for many years. 

In the meantime, we were just your standard, middle-class family. We were worrying about how to pay for the kids college. I was working too much. 

I was 49 when I found out about my wife's emotional affair. I tried to make the marriage work, and we tried everything. I even went to extensive couples and individual counseling. The woman sitting across from me was no longer the loving, warm, kind woman I knew. She was someone I could not trust. 

I imagined dying with her, and now, I felt as though I was dying to be away from her. Ironically, one of the investments I made early in my career took off at the same time, and we went from middle-class to part of the 1%. Quickly. 

I bought a house as far as I could from her and planned to spend half my time there and half my time at home to keep a stable home environment for the kids (who were now mostly grown) to have Christmas, etc. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I was five years into this. Then I met Kate. Kate is, I can say, truly, my soulmate. I did not believe in soulmates before I met her. I do now. It was casual. A coffee shop. She comments on my comic book, yes, I a 55 year old man was reading a comic book. Which is exactly what she commented on. 

We ended up laughing the better part of the day, and honestly, I haven't stopped since. 

Everything that was lacking in my marriage came from Kate... well almost everything. My ex-wife did not drink. Kate did. My ex-wife did not understand my Machiavellian side, Kate did. My ex-wife did not seem to understand my ""quirks"" which Kate just calls ""stimming"" because, as she has taught me, we are both autistic. 

Kate loved nothing more than understanding and playing with peoples minds, something I loved too. Something I never thought I would share with anyone. 

The only line Kate, and frankly I drew, was that Kate was ""not cut out to be a mistress"" -- so nothing romantic. She would say this teasingly, especially as we both acknowledged romantic feelings growing between us. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I got a divorce. It wasn't for Kate, per se, but it was because of her. I had hope. Joy. The divorce was terrible, and I would have left me, but through it all, Kate stayed by my side.  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Something else I love about my now-wife is that we can talk about anything. It was only after I met her I realized how seriously and throughly I had been censoring myself. Just tonight, when I decided I was going to make this post, in preparation for the""Gold Digger"" comments, I asked 

""There's no prenup, so is it about the money?"" Kate smiled at me the way she always has and walks over, 

""If it was about the money, I would be fucking ten of you wealthy, old, white guys and charge for it."" She smiles like we both know a secret ""It's the power."" 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

She knows, and acknowledges she only exists because of a mid life crisis, but she is so much more now. She asks if she is my ""do-over"" and sometimes I think she is. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Kate works her own full-time job that requires a doctorate degree and earns more than I did when I was her age, even accounting for inflation. 

She is also one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen in my life. Yes, she is physically gorgeous. I see how other men look at her, but it is more than that, she will be even more beautiful at 40 and 50 and 60. Her beauty makes my chest ache. It is like the feeling of air right after it rains, or remembering a song you had forgotten about. She is happiness so potent that you almost have to dance. 

I try my best to treat her well, we now have a semi-full staff. Someone makes breakfast and dinner, except for the weekends. We have people who clean, do laundry. I have never lied to her or manipulated her. I would never dream of cheating on her. I just love her, much like you guys love your SO's. 

I believed the phrase ""no one can be all things to someone else"" it is how I survived the years in my marriage before her. I no longer believe that. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Kate is kind and giving. She has made a genuine effort with my kids and has honestly supported them through so much. She is especially respectful of my relationship with my daughter. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Still, I get backlash from old mutual friends of my ex-wife or neighbors. Sometimes, people post mean things on our door.

Dear {Agent},

I’m writing to seek representation for TETHERED, a 105,000-word adult contemporary fantasy romance. My book features a protagonist who battles intrusive thoughts like in *Phantasma* by Kaylie Smith and has the horror, gothic vibes from *The Year of the Witching* by Alexis Henderson.

In Salem, Massachusetts, falling in love is dangerous…perhaps even a curse.

Plagued with whispering voices and intrusive thoughts, Dahlia is desperate for peace, for normalcy. She just wants to enjoy her newlywed life with her husband, Dean. But when they move into a Victorian home, the whispers and thoughts worsen, manifesting into tangible beings. Still, she ignores it like she has all her life. What’s one more haunting, anyway? 

Yet circumstances intensify when Dahlia meets Adam. A man she finds herself inexplicably drawn to against her will. Forced to uncover the darkness surrounding her, Dahlia learns that a centuries-old curse is real and intends to rip apart her marriage and world by demanding she leave Dean for Adam—or stay and risk Dean’s life. Racing against time, she must break the curse before Dean dies, or the connection between her and Adam becomes so persuasive she can no longer resist. But as Dahlia unveils pieces of Salem’s tormented past, she discovers secrets far darker than the curse, threatening everything she knows about herself.

 I’m a homeschool mom of three from Washington State. You can find me on my fourth cup of coffee, curled up in a book or writing make-believe stories in my free time. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Best,

 Erin Apple

1j8grc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1j8grc9/my_husband_often_makes_significant_decisions/,My husband often makes significant decisions without consulting me. What is going on?,"I’m a 39-year-old woman, married to my 44-year-old husband. I tend to be laid-back and usually don’t comment on much. We’ve been married for almost three years. However, I’ve noticed that my husband often makes purchases or does things without discussing them with me. For example, he might go to the movies alone or buy the latest iPhone—activities I initially thought were harmless. We maintain separate accounts; he pays most of the household bills, such as the mortgage and electricity, while I cover my personal expenses, including my cell phone, car payment, insurance, and credit card bills.

After I had our baby boy, he encouraged me to stay home to avoid sending him to daycare. Currently, I’m a student working towards my doctorate, and I have substantial savings that help cover my expenses. He sends me money weekly via Zelle to buy groceries, but I don’t know anything about his finances.

As time has gone on, I’ve noticed that he hardly communicates anything with me. For instance, one Saturday, he left around 8:30 AM and didn’t call or text to explain what he was doing. When I called him at 4:30 PM, he didn’t answer. He returned my call about an hour later, saying he was at work. Less than an hour later, he pulled up in a new car without even coming in to tell me about it; instead, he went straight to his office. I checked the garage, saw a different vehicle, and asked him whose car it was. He casually replied, ""Oh, I got a new car."" I was shocked and exclaimed, “What? Why did you lie about being at work?” This was my first major concern, and it happened in our first year of marriage.

Now, it has happened again this year! It feels like déjà vu; he repeated the same pattern. He even bought a huge customized arcade machine, which I assume was quite expensive, but he wouldn’t tell me the price. He didn't mention it until it was on its way for delivery. Additionally, he fails to share important events in his life, like a Christmas party at work or significant family news, such as his sister getting engaged. I feel like I’m always the last to know about everything, and I end up feeling like a stranger in my own marriage. 

He was getting something repaired one early morning and I came out the bedroom with my really short nightgown on to make some coffee and fix the baby breakfast, and there was this weird man in the house that he never even once mentioned someone was coming over. Even the man looked shocked when he saw me!!!

We both love Apple products, yet he literally lay next to me in bed and never once mentioned that he got the new iPhone 16 Pro Max. He went to the movies on Valentine's Day and didn’t mention it until last weekend. It doesn’t matter if it’s something small or big; he doesn’t share anything with me.

These are just highlights; there’s so much more. I’ve expressed my concerns about this behavior to him, but he doesn’t see anything wrong with it. Am I overthinking this, or is this strange behavior for a marriage? I need opinions because it's getting worse and now I'm feeling uneasy!!",2,1741660852.0,Marriage,16,1.0,False

I did not experience anything the first two nights and on the third night I was making a lot of involuntary movements, I yawned a lot and made snoring sounds.

I found it interesting that I was making these sounds considering I had sleep problems but I had no idea what any of it meant and I went back home with more questions than answers.

Fast forward a month later and I noticed that my sleep had improved. I was waking up at 5am ready to conquer the world! I had so much energy that I was going to the gym twice a day.

I decided to stop taking my sleep meds and I was still able to fall asleep. I even reintroduced morning coffee and I still was able to sleep.

My sleep is still trash but it is significantly better than the misery I had been living with.

In my case it seems like it takes a month before I feel the benefits of the healing that took place and I was wondering if there are others who experienced the same?

We’re using a reputable local contractor and pulling a permit. Trying to decide between using Techo Bloc concrete pavers over crushed stone and sand base or going with outdoor 2cm porcelain tile. The patio will have a free standing wood burning fireplace and some couches and a coffee table. Mostly used for just hanging out and the occasional party.

I like the tile because it’s non permeable so it won’t stain and it’s easier to clean, which is a big plus because we have small kids. Plus i understand it’s more durable and less likely to chip or crack if something is dropped. I’d go with a brand like Milestone or [Architessa](https://architessa.com/products/frontier20-slate-look?variant=44309555380385).

The install instructions say you can put it over crushed stone and sand but contractor is skeptical because they weigh less than the pavers and he’s concerned they are more likely to shift. So he recommends a poured concrete slab and using thinset mortar. I’m not opposed but concerned that this will make replacing any tiles that get damaged over time much harder.

I’ve been following this conflict and the arguments. This idea that Rwanda and M23 exist to funnel Congolese resources to the West makes 0 sense to me. First of all the smuggling of minerals from Congo to Rwanda would exist with or without M23, for example M23 financed itself early on not by taking control of mines but by taxing the already existing smuggling routes. Why would Rwanda incriminate themselves in this way for no reason when that was already going on fine?

The spike in smuggling from Congo to Rwanda really started after the U.S. passed Dodd Frank. A law that placed extreme regulations on minerals obtained from conflict-zones, this was an attempt to curb the funding of the conflict, but it instead just decimated Congo’s mining sector, which led to US companies simply choosing to not do work in Congo, they instead switched to Rwanda because it also had coltan and had developed traceability systems for its minerals, something Congo didn’t do, and even if they did probably would not have fixed their situation due to corruption. This happened in 2010, meaning the reason the West isn’t in Congo, isn’t because it doesn’t want to or is unable to access its resources due to the Congolese government. So, why prop up Rwanda if they’re feening so much for Congo’s resources? They could just repeal such laws and implement similar deals to what the Chinese are doing.

The Chinese own a stake in 70% of the mines in the DRC, this is due the collapse in the legal mining sector in the DRC following Dodd Frank. The Chinese do not have such laws and while they would prefer to ethically source their minerals, they are not losing sleep over this. So you would think the story goes, China dominates DRC’s mining sector and Rwanda serves the West by being a transit for smuggled Congolese mineral they need, right? WRONG.

The West depends more on China for coltan, and China has the largest control of the supply chain. Around, 70%+ of coltan exported from Rwanda in 2023 went to China, around 60% of all exports from Rwanda to China, excluding other minerals, is Coltan. Most of the West gets its Coltan after it is processed from China and it is shipped to Western countries. Like I said, China controls the entire supply chain, owning most of the mines in DRC and importing most of coltan in Congo and Rwanda to be used in its own processing plants. Rwanda’s exports to China alone was worth more than its export to Europe and the U.S. in 2023. And this is excluding other Asian countries. 

The vast majority of Rwanda’s exports then you would think to the west is of Coltan. Nope that is not the case, the vast majority of Rwanda’s exports to the West are agricultural, things like Coffee, Tea, legumes, vegetables. Rwanda’s biggest export partner is UAE, which took in like 100% of Rwanda’s Gold in 2023. Gold accounted for 65% of Rwanda’s exports and Coltan 7.5%, maybe less. 

Which begs the question, why is the chosen narrative that Rwanda is a tool for the West? To me, at this point it feels like a convenient scapegoat. If anything it makes more sense to say Rwanda is a tool for the UAE or China, but those simply do not hit/resonate as hard given Congo’s history of colonialism, and if I was the DRC it’s simply not smart to incriminate your biggest economic ally, being China. 

Overall, Rwanda’s economy is very much non-dependent on Coltan, and whatever Coltan they have is not sent to the West. In fact in 2023 Rwanda exported more Coltan to South Africa than all of Europe, $210 worth, thus it makes 0 sense that Rwanda would engage militarily for the sake of securing minerals for a Western power. At this point for me, that narrative makes 0 sense to me.

I stepped on the scale this morning, and for the first time in years, I saw a number I’m proud of: 71kg (156 lbs). A “normal” BMI. Body fat at 17%. Two years ago, I was obese (BMI 31), living off pizza and cookie dough ice cream like it was a personality trait. I ruined my 20-year-old body, and I hated looking in the mirror. But today, I feel different. Lighter. Healthier. Not just physically, but mentally.

I wasted so much time on dumb fitness trends, pointless supplements, and ""magic"" diets that never worked. But when I finally cracked the code, everything changed. Losing weight wasn’t about suffering through endless workouts or cutting every carb - it was about getting smarter with my food and training. 80% diet, 20% exercise. And these were the foods that made it possible:

**- Oatmeal - basic but undefeated. Filling, healthy, and fixed my digestion.**

**- Chicken breast - obviously.**

**- Vegetables (tomatoes, etc.) - eat them, they matter.**

**- Protein shakes - easy, convenient, and great mixed with oats.**

**- Black coffee & tea - appetite control and energy boost in one.**

**- Protein bread - if you love bread but hate the carbs, this is the hack.**

Of course, food alone didn’t fix my mindset. Losing weight was just as much a mental battle as a physical one. My biggest breakthrough? Therapy. I didn’t want to admit I needed it, but my anxiety around food, exercise, and self-worth wasn’t going to solve itself. Here’s what actually helped me rewire my brain:

\- **Your thoughts lie to you. The fear of “failing” a diet is worse than actually messing up. One bad meal won’t ruin you. Obsessing over perfection will.**

**- Willpower is overrated. Habits and environment matter more. If you have junk food everywhere, you’ll eat it. Make your default choices healthy.**

**- Food guilt is pointless. You’re not “bad” for eating a cookie. The key is consistency, not punishment.**

My therapist also threw a bunch of book recs at me, and honestly, reading these changed everything. If you are in the same situation, these books are the next best thing:

**-** [**Grain Brain**](https://befreed.ai/book/grain-brain-by-david-perlmutter) **by David Perlmutter (Your brain might be addicted to the wrong foods)**

This book made me question everything I thought i knew about carbs. The author talks about how processed grains and sugars can mess with your brain, mood, and weight. If you’ve ever felt like your cravings are controlling you, this is a must-read.

**-** [**Burn**](https://befreed.ai/book/burn-by-herman-pontzer) **by Herman Pontzer (You can’t outwork a bad diet)**

This book completely changed how I see calories and metabolism. Pontzer, an evolutionary anthropologist, studied hunter-gatherer tribes and found that our bodies adapt to burn a set amount of calories no matter how much we move. It explains why exercise alone isn’t enough for fat loss - and why diet is king. Insanely eye-opening read.

**-** [**Built to Move**](https://befreed.ai/book/built-to-move-by-kelly-starrett) **by Kelly & Juliet Starrett (Make fitness sustainable)**

 A practical guide on how to move better, feel stronger, and prevent injuries. Helped me fix my form and mobility issues.

**- The Joy of Half a Cookie by Jean Kristeller (Stop emotional eating)**

If you’ve ever felt out of control around food, this book is a must-read. It teaches mindful eating techniques that actually work (no, it’s not just “eat slower”).

**- The Diet Fix by Yoni Freedhoff (Ditch all-or-nothing thinking)**

This book is for anyone who’s ever felt like they “failed” a diet. It’s all about breaking the cycle of restrictive eating and learning how to eat in a way you can sustain forever.

Looking back, I wish I had figured all this out sooner. The weight loss industry thrives on confusion, but the truth is simple: eat mostly whole foods, move consistently, and fix your mindset. If you’re struggling, I promise you’re not alone - but you have to take the first step. And if you don’t know where to start? Read. Learning about nutrition and psychology made all the difference for me. Hope it helps you too.",61,1741659632.0,1200isplenty,5,0.95,False

Here are my tips. I'd love to hear what you're doing to stay sane.

Last week I hit a breaking point with the noisiness of American news and people panicking. After processing some of my stress in therapy, I decided to take some steps for my mental health:

**I uninstalled all social media apps** from my phone. It's been 5 days, and I don't miss it at all.

The next morning, **I emailed a handful of** **people I love & respect** in my church and friend group. This is what I wrote:

*Hi friends, Sorry in advance for a long email.*

*The past couple of months in our country have been chaotic, to say the least. I'm reaching out to you as I consider you part of my local ""sisterhood"" and I've been thoughtfully considering how to navigate our world and engage in conversations about tough topics while being informed but mindful of my media consumption. I'm constantly being bombarded by troubling news and hot takes, and have a feeling you may be, too. Being open and listening are two of my core values. But the division and polarizing nature of news information right now certainly has me questioning:*

* *Where are they \[fill in any name of a loved one or friend\] getting their information?* 
* *Can I trust the sources I've been listening to?* 
* *What is the ""other side"" saying?*
* *Am I losing my mind?* 

*I feel strongly that it's important to stay informed, and also that I need space in my life for peace. I've stepped away from social media for Lent even though there are many friends that I enjoy connecting with in those spaces. So part of my reaching out is an effort to maintain real connection—not knowing what it needs to look like exactly, but an open invitation to disengage in consumption that is making our anxiety rise and engage in thoughtful discussion—with a safe community. Let me know if you're interested and we can keep the conversation going.*

Sharing this because I've been deeply moved by the responses I've gotten. Some just replied, ""Yes. I'm in."" and others really opened up and were vulnerable in meaningful ways. I've had coffee/lunch with a few of them since. Some haven't replied, which is also okay. 

**I subscribed to a few Substack authors** that I respect and who do a good job with research and fact-based reporting. (I also get a few free email newsletters from media sources to stay informed.)

That is all. These things are helping me. Maybe these could help you too. Or, feel free to share steps you've taken to stay sane.

After three years of radio silence, I have emerged from the digital abyss to bring this subreddit back to life. No, this isn’t a coordinated comeback. No, I don’t have a team. It’s just me, armed with a keyboard, an unreasonable love for FOSS, and a desperate attempt to stop this place from becoming a digital ghost town.

🔄 What’s Changing?

✅ App Posts That Actually Tell You Something – No more “Here’s an app. Use it.” Expect full descriptions, sources, and direct download links. Basically, less mystery, more usability.

✅ Finding Apps Won’t Feel Like a Pointless Side Quest – I’m working on a proper tagging system (flairs, pinned lists, guides) so you can actually find what you’re looking for instead of scrolling aimlessly and questioning your life choices.

✅ Taking Suggestions… Within Reason – Yes, I’m open to user-suggested apps. No, I will not review 15 different “open-source calculator” forks unless you personally compensate me in coffee.

✅ Expanding Beyond Android – Open-source is everywhere, not just on your phone. I’m looking for people who can help post about Linux, Windows, and macOS apps. Because let’s be real—I can’t carry this entire subreddit on my back.

🛠️ What’s Next?

📌 Cleaning Up Old Posts – Some of the apps posted years ago may no longer exist. Others may now be owned by questionable companies. I’ll be updating or removing them accordingly.

📌 Fixing Flairs & Categories – Because “Calendar” and “App Store” as post flairs just aren’t cutting it.

📌 Trying Not to Burn Out – If anyone wants to help moderate or just keep me from losing my mind, DM me before I disappear into a FOSS rabbit hole forever.

🛑 So You Want to Be a Mod? READ THIS FIRST.

Listen, I’m all for community involvement, but if you want to be a mod, you must DM me first. No rogue moderators will be tolerated. This isn’t a chaotic startup where people randomly declare themselves CEO. If you get mod powers and immediately start banning people or renaming the sub to r/FREE-VBUX-OPEN-SOURCE, I will find you.

Tell me why you want to mod, what you can contribute, and most importantly, whether you know the difference between GPL and MIT licenses. That last one won’t make or break your application, but it will determine how much I trust you with the subreddit.

I want to make this the best open-source app hub on Reddit. It’ll take time, but I’m doing my best. So drop your suggestions, send some encouragement, or just sit back and enjoy the chaos.

Why are we discontinuing tried and true flavors like blueberry and peach and introducing weird ass off the cuff niche shit like Juneberry, Apricot and Grapefruit???","Before anyone dismantles my oppressive establishment board by board, i like Juneberry, SA and Grapefruit. That's not my point.

My favorite redbull flavors have always been: 

#1 Peach
#2 Tropical
#3 Blueberry

So in just this season, im losing (if blueberry rumor is true) 2 of my favorite flavors and flavors that are basically staples of *any* mixed flavor line of literally almost anything and for what, berries i've never heard of before and Iced Vanilla Berry which is basically sweet tarts in liquid form?

Why does Monster get a line up of like 10 different flavors, and then a juice lineup *and* a coffee lineup but everytime a new flavor gets introduced we have to say goodbye to one that we've grown accustomed to being able to get?

Rant over im truthfully just pissed about Peach Nectarine that shit was like sent from jesus christ himself, hopefully white peach tastes similar and if it does that shit better stick around if wild berries gets to which literally tastes like a bed bath and beyond smells like honestly fuck watermelon as well it gets to always stay despite always sucking balls ive runon this sentence on purpose.",2,1741659402.0,redbull,2,0.75,False

I took a bus the other day and while I was there a person came in and their attempt to tag on failed. The bus driver said there was not enough money on their card and the person looked upset and embarrassed and started doing something on their phone, probably trying to top up but the problem is the online top up is not instant. 
I know at this point it’s almost impossible to implement, but what do you think in general? Would it be a bad idea to suspend bus trips for people who can’t pay or simply forget to top up which can happen to anyone?",0,1741659246.0,auckland,10,0.33,False
