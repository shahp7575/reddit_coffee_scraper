I got the same one, same price during last year's holiday period and I love it. It was a replacement for a ""better"" model that we had had for four years but it was a lemon, bought as an open box, and the brew unit never slid in and out right, and it was no longer worth the $200 repair. 

We like this one better even though it only comes in black (kitchen is all light color) and is louder when it grinds and brews. It is way more functional, and just better I think. It has been trouble free for a year. We just bought one as a gift for the in laws who love our coffee and had been using a nearly broken Keureg. 

We decided not to spend the money when ours broke last year and went to a good drip machine, and it was just a major hassle when we were rushed in the AM.

1pgj7my,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1pgj7my/what_do_you_think_of_the_book_im_currently_writing/,What do you think of the book I'm currently writing?,"I already know the direction I want it to go in, but I want to see what the reader's initial thoughts are about this story. Here's the start of it: 	It’s been eight years. Eight years, three months, and twenty five days since I’ve seen my mom. I last remember her lying in my arms, her eyes cold, body stiff. Her face was pale, nose bloodied, and bruised up.



I lost her to my classmates. A group of teens, looking to take revenge on me. I was only seventeen at the time, working two jobs after school to try to provide for my mom and I to live in such a harsh economy. My mom was fresh out of jail and no job wanted her working for them, so she laid around in our cramped apartment unit drinking all day. I was a bad kid, got into lots of fights outside of school during my freshman year, but I stopped that during my sophomore year. These kids though, they still held a grudge against me till our senior year, when they beat my mom up and left her out in the snow. 



I was working my first shift when that happened, so she stayed there for hours till my second shift ended. I found her lying on the snowy pavement outside of the apartment building. She was all bruised up. Her lips were turning blue from the cold, fingertips purple, holding a broken beer bottle in her hand, and her skin turned pale. I picked her up and held her in my arms, checking for a pulse…. None. She died to the cold, left out for hours and no passerbys had noticed. I don’t remember what I did after, probably cried if I had to guess. 



I was taken in for interrogation shortly after my mom’s death. I told them about the group of teens, told them they were out to take revenge on me. They questioned them too but I guess the kids weren’t really taking the situation as serious. Afterall, they weren’t the ones who had lost their mom that night. I could’ve taken them to court that time, I could’ve, but I was barely making ends meet as is, and a lawyer would’ve cost a fortune.



They beat me up every day of my life after that. They wanted to make sure I remember my mistake and never tell on them ever again. But one day, something different happened. 



“YOU RAT! Why would you tell?” they yelled as they kicked me around. “This is your lesson for messing with us, you bitch!”



“Stop.” Their group leader ordered them and they ran out the way like dogs. He ran his fingers through his red hair, swooping it to the side before kneeling down to my level. “ Why don’t you ever fight back? Are you a pussy?” 



“I’m not a pussy, I just know what you guys are capable of doing to one’s mother. You guys are assho-”



“Hey!” The fat one of the group tries to swing at me, but the group leader stops him.



“Did I order you to do that? No. So leave. NOW!” He hurried away down the streets like a lost puppy. “Now back to you, what can I do to get you to fight back? I never see you do so.”



“You can leave me alone and stop beating me up every day.” I reply, smirking back at him.



“I’m Kai. Once you’re ready to stop whining like a little girl, tell me and I can help you. Now you guys can go back to what you were doing.” He walked away and went on his phone, completely ignoring his surroundings. They went back to beating me up, it’s almost as if they are the pussy ones, only listening to instructions. All I knew at the time was, I’m not letting them get away with it. 



Present day-



“Connor, someone’s here to see you!” Jessica yelled down to me from her office chair.



“Already? This early in the morning? Send them down already.” I scoff, gulping down a large sip of coffee. “Come in and take a seat.”



“Hi Detective, I just wanted to check in on my son’s case. How's that going?”



Right. This is my job now. Investigating murders is way different than being a grocery store cashier. “Well I found out your son has been murder-”



“Yes, I already knew that detective. Stop making me wait around!”



“I wasn’t done ma’am. You see, your son has been murdered by your sister.” Here it comes.



“NATALIA? Natalia would never do such a thing! I’m never coming back to this place!”



“I hope not. May god prevent any murders around yo-”



“I’m leaving and I’m leaving a terrible review on yelp!” she yells as she storms out the station. I hate giving bad news but it’s part of my job. Afterall, I chose this job. I chose to help people who know someone close to them that has died. I was in that situation once and I know how it feels to not have anyone there to help out with that, so I want to help these people out. But some of them just don’t appreciate my help.



“Connor! My man!” Oliver walks straight into my office, slamming the door behind him. In his hands were two hot chocolates. 



“You got me hot chocolate? Let’s go! It’s cold out and I could definitely use one right now!”



“Nah bro this for my girl, but I need your help.” His tone became serious. He grabs into his pockets and pulls out a stack of money. “Come on bro, just do it.”



“I’m sorry but you have to let go, Oliver. It’s been six years!” I say, trying to comfort him.



“Listen, she’s my sister. I’m not letting go till I find out who’s behind it.” He leans into my desk “It’s your job, isn’t it? I’ll pay you extra!” He says, pulling out another stack of money. 



You can’t really say no to that much money. I mean, nothing bad will happen if I try? “Fine, but any information you get is what you’ll take. And then you’ll finally let go. Deal?”



“Deal.” He enthusiastically replies before skipping out of the room. “It was nice to see you man! Now I have to get to my girl before these get cold.”



Oliver is only a young boy. He’s eighteen, freshly an adult. I met him when he lost his sister. I was 19 at the time. His parents were neglecting, so his sister was the only person he had to rely on. I knew what that felt like, so I decided to be there for him when his sister died. We grew closer over the years, now best friends. I don’t know what I would do without him, so it’s only fair I decided to investigate his sister’s death for him.

1pgj7gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Adorable_Reading_609/comments/1pgj7gf/genz_against_government_corruption/,Genz against government corruption,"Nepal fixed there corruption, why shouldn’t we??

I woke up today an saw a post which is proven to be true on how the department of homeland security’s twitter page was ran from Tel Aviv…that alone should say enough. But what really baffles me is how we have the numbers, an how we’re letting this country go to complete shit. Chaos/destruction always brings creation. How many more times will we allow our government to betray an make life harder for us. Physical oppression, financial oppression, spiritual oppression. Something has to be done realistically.
Things to note: The federal reserve was not supposed to be a thing. The titanic is then announced in 1912 an alot of the worlds financial leaders were supposed to be on there(some opposing to the federal reserve) or in simple terms opposing to the NWO. “Several prominent people, including J.P. Morgan, Milton S. Hershey, and George Washington Vanderbilt II, were scheduled to sail on the Titanic but canceled their trips and did not go” Take into account they weren’t the richest men at that time. There were wealthier righteous men who opposed the federal reserve. An I don’t mean righteous as in they are saints. I mean righteous in terms of, they weren’t in cahoots with the other side which is why they never got the opportunity to magically cancel there trip. Instead they were lured an baited on a boat that was meant to sink. The opposing side who wanted the federal reserve played chess an knocked off the previous kings/queens/bishops off the board. Ultimately resorting in them rising into power(things being under their control) Then peep how the federal reserve was not a thing until 1913, shortly after 1914 to be exact; World War 1 is started. How is this not looked at as suspicious or something to question better yet how is this not seen as a setup for the American people to purposely crash the economy/keep people distracted. 
- 1912 Titanic Sinks with people on it who had the power and wealth to fight off the evil people. 
- The people who were targeted to parish when the titanic sank were opposed to the federal reserve.
 - 1913 The aftermath of titanic, leads to the federal reserve being created. One year is all it took. Seems odd…
- 1914 to 1918 World War 1… seems staged or forced better yet. To avoid people asking questions or digging deeper as to why the titanic sank then the reserve was created a diversion is then created. So they(the evil people) start a war. 
Simply just a distraction but also as a test to see there control/how easily manipulated the American people are. 
- Shortly after buy now pay later is created(credit) I know for a fact that some soldiers questioned if that war was worth fighting. So to avoid people from thinking or seeking the truth or real answers/ to prevent any top of rising the government then throws another bone(distraction) an credit becomes a thing with two purposes to be served. Purpose 1 distract the people by allowing them the fancy things they want but could never really afford, that’ll make them not see the corruption or bad things the evil people were doing.
A purpose 2 drive the wedge between each financial class/create debt for the common folk to bury them while boosting their own financial status. Shortly after the roaring 1920’s of everyone splurging having a blast being ignorant as to why America went to war…or why something that was opposed was in effect. We see a rapid decline in the economy leading to the Great Depression(1930) meaning 10 years was all it took for the higher ups to drain and liquidate the pockets of the American people ultimately setting them(the American people) back, an the economy back but boosting the financial status of the evil ones who wanted the federal reserve. Something needs to be done. Someone else has to see the pattern or see through the lies/setup an plights our government has set. 
Key thing to note: The wars were never won. They were won on the forefront but on the backend they weren’t. 
Revolutionary war- American Patriots fighting for independence against British rule, but also against fellow colonists who remained loyal to the Crown (Loyalists)
Civil war- The United States (Union) against the seceded Confederate States (South)
Those victories were hard fought but at the same time they were given with a bigger agenda at hand. The wars were simply distractions. An a time period for the evil ones to conspire. Rome was not built overnight is a saying for a reason…the plotting of tearing down a country took time for the evil ones. So false progress was given to keep the American people comfortable, an we all know there is never growth in comfort.  “Winning”the revolutionary war simply was a front we won but at the same time it made them plot an sent the loyalist in hiding an obviously they would think of a bigger plan to take over. Then the civil war. Now Americans fighting amongst themselves…first we fought against threat but then against ourselves which would obviously give opportunity for the loyalist from the revolutionary war to recruit people that were within our own country…some who would eventually grow into power one day…recruiting young or better yet being in cahoots with Americans who lost during the civil war an want to rise to power by any means but can’t necessarily do it right away. So they play the long game. Ultimately winning. This country was built off the backs of the common people, a lot of death, an deceit. With destruction comes creation. An the evil higher ups have destroyed on many occasions to create a tighter grip/grasp upon the common folk. 

We have to take some type of stand because we gotta really think, how will our children’s circumstances be…or our grandchildren. We are in an era where we have the resources an information to easily gain the truth but also to fight for the truth. Our generation is nothing like the last because we are the wake up call for this country. An eventually it’ll be in our hands. But if we don’t take a stand or start fixing things corruption will always run this country. An we will always be sheep. To some extent we gotta wake up an smell the coffee a realize is it worth slaving a being oppressed by a bunch of old evil non spirit having greedy men. A change needs to come or we’ll eventually end up under control by a whole new country or better yet we’ll all end up dead. Because with the type of government we have they’ll try to trap us before they let us out. An better yet they’ll try to kill us before truth can come out. The rabbit hole gets real deep. But all the higher higher ups are in cahoots. The president’s really hold no power because there are people in the background that fund it all. An it’s a common saying but big bank takes little bank. People need to wake up. 
Me knowing how my generation is there’s a chance you probably haven’t read this whole thing but if you did. It shows your concern an initiative to wanting better for this country an for yourself/future generations to come.

I didn't have high expectations but I was hoping for a little more than I received being the first of a new brand.  To start, the rooms were mildly renovated. Yes, there's new carpet and furniture and the lobby looks fresh but overall that's about it. Same old junky air conditioner and heat units in the rooms and a raggedy grinding scary elevator. They took out the bathtubs and made it a platform shower which looks weird because the faucet is very low to the new floor. They have these very annoying new light switches they installed that are very bright LED lights, so at night you have to find something to cover them up if you like sleeping in the dark. Breakfast was a waffle bar, egg bites, mini fridge with yogurt and hard boiled eggs in it, and a juice and coffee machine. The coffee was equivalent to brown water. Hyatt Place breakfast was better in comparison. I realized the reason they have a market - so you can buy your own frozen breakfast and microwave it in your room. It's not ALL bad though. The bed was actually comfortable so that was a bright spot. Having a desk and sofa in the room was nice, and the front desk staff were also very friendly which I appreciated. Appears if you're a Hyatt member at any level you'll get free bottles of water at the front desk, even if you aren't a Globalist (that's what the front desk told me anyway).

Adrian



I failed my first CCNA attempt with a score of 58%. But the exam itself was only part of the disaster. This is the story of my preparation, my mistakes, and what happened in that testing room that still frustrates me to this day.

The Third Time Starting

Summer 2025. I was staring at Jeremy's IT Lab CCNA course for the third time. The first two attempts? I stopped around video 15 or 20. Out of 125 videos. Something always got in the way - work, life, or just the overwhelming feeling that this mountain was too high to climb.



But this time I made a decision. I wasn't going to let myself quit. Without any real preparation, I purchased the CCNA exam with a Safeguard voucher (which gives you a free retake if you fail) and scheduled it for the beginning of September. Then I did something that felt brave at the time - I took two weeks of vacation right before the exam.



I had about 3-4 weeks total to prepare. Was that enough? I had no idea. But mentally, I was ready for any sacrifice.



The Reality of ""Full-Time Study""

Exhausted studying at computer

The reality of CCNA studying: exhaustion wins, no matter what time of day.



Week one: I sat in front of my computer, headphones on, watching Jeremy explain networking concepts. It went okay. I was focused. I was learning.



Week two: I moved the computer to the kitchen. Why? So I could smoke while studying. I noticed I was going from one pack a day to two. Eventually I bought a vape just to manage it.



Week three: The kitchen wasn't working anymore. I couldn't concentrate on the computer screen. So I moved to the living room and cast Jeremy's videos to the TV. That's when the real problem started - sleep was coming upon me no matter what time of day it was. Jeremy's calm, methodical voice became like natural sleeping pills. I'd wake up and have no idea what video I was on.



Falling asleep while studying

Falling asleep to Jeremy's videos became a daily routine. Even the cat gave up.



The Concept Chaos

Here's the thing about CCNA - there's a LOT of material. By the time you reach Day 50 of Jeremy's course, you've forgotten what Day 10 was about. I was watching videos, but the concepts were mixing together in my head like soup.



Spanning Tree was getting confused with OSPF. Designated Routers mixed up with Root Bridges. NAT blurring into DHCP. And the automation section? Every time I saw ""REST API"" my brain just screamed ""I NEED SOME REST!""



I bought the ExamTopics question bank hoping it would help, but without clear concepts, the questions just made me more confused.



The Final Week of Desperation

With one week left before the exam, I finally finished watching all the videos. Now I had to actually learn this stuff. I started grinding through practice questions - 12 to 14 hours every single day. I swear I'm not exaggerating.



Three days before the exam, my vacation ended. I was back at work during the day and studying at night. Running on coffee and anxiety.



Exam Day

Sunny morning, beginning of September. I walked into the testing center trying to feel confident. An older woman was supervising - she checked my ID, did the security protocols, and sat me down at my station.



The exam started, and I quickly realized the simulation labs were going to destroy me. I got four of them. FOUR. Each one was like a mini-nightmare where I second-guessed every command I typed.



By the time I finished the labs, I looked at the clock: 71 minutes remaining. 68 questions still to answer. And I desperately needed to use the toilet.



The Incident

I raised my hand. The supervisor acknowledged me. I went to the bathroom - no more than 2 minutes, I swear.



When I came back, the old woman was at my computer. The screen was locked (standard security procedure when you leave your seat), and she was frantically typing, trying to unlock it.



She couldn't type the @ symbol.



The keyboard was set to a different language layout. She was pressing Shift+2 expecting @, but getting "" instead. For 10-15 minutes, she struggled with this while my exam time ticked away.



Finally, I stepped in, figured out what she needed to do, and unlocked the station myself. My 71 minutes had become 56. I had 68 questions to answer in under an hour.



The Result

58%

I failed.

CCNA Failed Score Breakdown

My actual score breakdown. Security Fundamentals at 47% hurt, but losing 15 minutes to a keyboard issue hurt more.



That afternoon, as the initial shock wore off, I started thinking. Yes, my preparation wasn't perfect. Yes, I struggled with the labs. But those 15 minutes lost to a keyboard language issue? That wasn't my fault.



Fighting the System

For the next two and a half months, I tried to get answers. First from Pearson VUE, then from Cisco directly. I explained the security incident. I asked them to review the video and audio recordings from the testing room - recordings that should clearly show what happened.



The testing center's response? They claimed I was the one who changed the keyboard language.



But here's what they don't understand: the testing computers are locked down. You can't change system settings without administrator rights. It's literally impossible for a test-taker to do that.



Cisco didn't care to investigate. The case was closed.



The Hardest Part

You know what the worst part was? It wasn't the failed score. It wasn't even the unfair circumstances. It was the terrifying thought that I had to start ALL OVER AGAIN.



All those videos. All those concepts that had already started fading. All those hours of study. I had to do it again, knowing that the exam was even harder than I'd imagined.



But that's exactly what I did. And the second time, I did things differently...",1,1765116331.0,ccna,0,1.0,False

Also considering the 2025 Architecture Competition book. Has anyone bought a competition-yearbook like that before — is it useful inspiration or more like a coffee-table piece?

Open to all suggestions (German or international mags available in Germany). Thanks in advance! 🎄",1,1765116199.0,architecture,0,1.0,False

I’m 22 and had just landed my first real job at an IT company. At the beginning, it felt like I’d won the lottery. My boss was friendly, the team was amazing, we helped each other out, laughed together – honestly one of the best workplaces I could’ve imagined.

Then I started noticing wierd stuff going on in the company.

My boss would bring me coffee every morning without me asking. He’d show up with chocolates, pastries, once even a bouquet of flowers “just because.” I thought he was just being nice… until it wasn’t nice anymore.

One ordinary afternoon I came back from lunch and found a beautifully wrapped gift box on my desk. I opened it in front of half the office. Inside? Black lace lingerie. And a handwritten note:

“Be at my place tonight. Wear this for me ”

My stomach dropped. This man was married. He had two little kids – I’d seen the family photos on his desk a hundred times.

I marched straight to his office, shaking with rage, threw the box on his desk and told him loud and clear: “This is disgusting. I’m not sleeping with you. Ever.”

He went pale, snatched the box, and with the fakest laugh I’ve ever heard said, “Whoa, calm down! This was actually for my wife – total mix-up!”

I turned around and walked out. Everyone heard it. The room was dead silent.

And that’s when the real hell began.

The next day the entire team froze me out. People I’d had lunch with for months suddenly wouldn’t even make eye contact. He had spread lies that I was a snitch, that I was secretly reporting everyone to HR, that I couldn’t be trusted. No one was allowed to help me with anything. He started writing me up for things that didn’t exist – being “two minutes late,” “incorrect tone in emails,” random fines taken straight out of my salary.

One day he screamed at me in front of the whole floor over a typo. I burst into tears, grabbed my bag, and walked out. I never went back.

I quit that same week.

But before I left… let’s just say I left a little “going-away present” on his computer that he’ll never forget

If you want to know what I did (and trust me, it was glorious), drop a comment and I’ll make a separate post about it.

Thank you for letting me get this off my chest. Some workplaces aren’t just toxic – they’re dangerous. Stay safe out there",1,1765116147.0,BadBosses,0,1.0,False
1pgj25z,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1pgj25z/aita_for_exposing_my_90k_in_family_support_at/,AITA for exposing my $90K in family support at dad's funeral after being cut out of his will?,"My father died three weeks ago and I'm the one everyone's calling selfish.

For fifteen years I sent my parents $500 every single month. Started when I was 23 and got my first real job. Dad had a stroke that year, couldn't work anymore. Mom was trying to keep their house afloat on her part-time grocery store income. I didn't even think about it, just set up the automatic transfer.

My older brother never sent a dime. He's 41 now, makes decent money as a regional sales manager, has a nice house in the suburbs with his wife and their two kids. But according to my parents he was ""building his future"" and ""had his own family to support."" I was single for most of those years so apparently my money was just free for the taking.

I never threw it in anyone's face. Never asked for thank yous. Just kept sending it because they needed it and I loved them.

Dad's funeral was last Saturday. The will reading happened the day before. I sat there in the lawyer's office with my brother and his wife, expecting maybe we'd split things down the middle. The house, dad's life insurance payout, his retirement account he'd barely touched. It wasn't a fortune but it was something. Maybe $180,000 total.

The lawyer read it out. Everything to my brother. The whole amount. Not a fifty-fifty split. Not even a small token to me. Just ""I leave my entire estate to my son because he has a family to provide for and needs it more.""

I sat there feeling like I'd been punched. My brother looked uncomfortable but his wife had this little smile. She squeezed his hand.

After the reading my brother pulled me aside. ""Look, you know how dad was. Traditional. He just thought since I have kids..."" He trailed off. ""Maybe we can work something out later.""

I didn't believe him for a second.

The funeral reception was at my aunt's house. About forty people. Everyone eating casseroles and talking in quiet voices about what a good man dad was. My brother gave this touching speech about dad teaching him to fish, dad coming to his baseball games, all that stuff. People were crying.

I'd brought something with me. A folder I'd put together the night before. I didn't sleep, just sat at my kitchen table printing out fifteen years of bank statements. Every transfer highlighted. Every $500 with the date right there.

When my brother finished his speech and people were clapping, I stood up.

""I want to say something too.""

My mom looked at me. ""Sweetheart, maybe now isn't-""

""I sent dad and mom $500 every month for fifteen years."" My voice was shaking but I kept going. ""I started in June 2009. That's $90,000 total. I have every single bank transfer right here.""

I opened the folder. Started reading. ""June 15, 2009. $500. July 15, 2009. $500. August 15, 2009. $500.""

""Stop it,"" my brother said. His face was red.

I didn't stop. I read louder. ""January 15, 2010. $500. February 15, 2010. $500."" I flipped pages. ""June 15, 2015. $500. November 15, 2018. $500. March 15, 2021. $500.""

People were staring. My aunt tried to grab my arm but I moved away.

""April 15, 2024. $500. That was seven months ago. Two months before dad died, I sent the last one. June 15, 2024. $500.""

My brother's wife stood up. ""This is completely inappropriate.""

""You know what's inappropriate?"" I looked right at her. ""Taking $180,000 from a man who never put in a cent while his sister paid for fifteen years of their mortgage, their medical bills, their groceries.""

I held up the folder. ""I have copies for anyone who wants them. Every transfer. Every dollar. All $90,000 of it.""

""You're making a scene at your father's funeral,"" my mom said. Her voice was breaking.

""Yeah. I am."" I looked around the room. ""Because apparently the only inheritance I get is everyone thinking I'm the selfish one. So here's what I'm taking instead: the truth. Everyone here now knows exactly what happened. They know who actually took care of you and dad. They know who got rewarded for it.""

My brother stood there with his mouth open. His wife grabbed her purse and walked out. Just left him standing there. I heard her car start in the driveway thirty seconds later.

I put the folder down on the coffee table. ""Anyone wants to see the receipts, they're right there. Consider this my inheritance.""

Then I left.

My phone's been blowing up since Saturday. My brother called me a vindictive bitch. My mom says I ruined dad's memory. My aunt says I had every right to be angry but the funeral wasn't the place. Half my cousins are on my side, half think I should have kept it private.

My brother's wife hasn't come back. I heard from my cousin she's staying with her sister and talking about how she ""didn't know what kind of family she married into."" My brother's been calling me nonstop but I'm not answering.

I keep thinking maybe I should have just let it go. Dad's gone. The money's gone. Maybe I should have been the bigger person.

But then I remember sitting in that lawyer's office hearing I got nothing after fifteen years and I don't feel sorry anymore.

We recently upgraded from a blade grinder to the Breville Smart Grinder Pro and that has been an immense upgrade. On the weekend we use an Aeropress XL as our primary source of coffee making, however during the work week we prefer to set up the coffee maker the night before as I typically wake up and am out the door quickly. 

We currently have a Cuisinart coffee machine which I know is not the best. So we are on the market for a new machine. I have been doing some research and like the Breville Luxe Brewer but with it being a couple hundred dollars I wanted to hear others thoughts. 

Requirements:
-Must be able to set it up to brew at a specific time
-Thermal carafe (Minimum of 40oz)

I can say that I’ve pretty much gotten most men I’ve wanted in the past, and even though the number isn’t high, in my mind it’s proof that social and romantic relationships are not as complex as we overthink them to be.

So, I started being involved with this group of friends that I met while attending a pottery course. I do pottery, and these group of friends had signed up for the same course as me. They’re 10 people, and one of them is this guy who is 4 years younger than me.

He is very extroverted and fun, but also passionate when it comes to social issues. He made friends with everybody in our course (a total of 25 people in each session + 3 pottery teachers) and is very comfortable with everyone. He talks about anything and everything very smoothly, doesn’t feel social anxiety at all, except when he is with me. The first day, we locked eyes as soon as I entered class, and I felt right away that there would be some feelings between us.

He is always, always staring at me, and we sit in a way where we’re facing each other, but there’s a couple of meters between us. I try to give him a smile when we meet eyes, but it doesn’t always come out as warm as I want it to be. He is always around me, and there’s a palpable energy between us that other people are able to feel. I’ve had multiple people tell me that he’s interested in me, and I observed that he feels stressed whenever he speaks to me. He has certain mannerisms that he does when he’s stressed, and they are all present when we interact, but again we don’t interact much because the talkative outgoing guy becomes mute when he’s around me.

The thing is, I’m absolutely sure that he likes me, and I like him too. In the past, I messaged him to help him with something, and he left me on delivered for a full day before leaving a single emoji on my messages. Weeks later I messaged him again for a different thing and even invited him for coffee, to which he replied by saying that he was busy that day, but he would love to get coffee the next week. However, next week I couldn’t show up at the course due to health reasons, and he didn’t contact me at all.

So, this man who I know likes me, is absolutely non-existent when it comes to messaging, and whatever I do, I can’t seem to break his shyness. I have playfull held him by his arm a couple of times, made jokes, and as I said I try to give him smiles as much as possible. I try to make it as clear as possible to him that I like him, but he either doesn’t get it, or I’m reading him wrong.

I understand that there’s high social risk if he showed me interest and I rejected since we’re in the same course and will be continue to be for a couple of months, but I’m ready to take this risk, in his place too. I have always been able to interact with men romantically without much stress, but I don’t know what I can do with this guy at all. I’m afraid of scaring him away since I’m quite intense and probably a little too direct for him, so I’m in need of some advice…

So, my question is, how can I help him break through his shyness? How do I know that I’m reading the situation correctly? What clear signs can I give him to show that I’m interested in him?",2,1765115960.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

Vito Dambrosio, 30, stands accused of two counts of murder in the first degree, according to the Nassau County Police Department.

The incident occurred early Thursday at A&A Italian Deli and Pizza on Hicksville Road in Bethpage — a small, census-designated place located within the town of Oyster Bay — the police department said.

That day, Angela Pulisciano, 62, the defendant's mother, and Antonio Dambrosio, 70, the defendant's father, were working at the deli when their son started a fight, authorities allege.

At some point, the argument turned violent, according to the police department's homicide squad. The defendant's mother was pronounced dead at the scene of the crime; the defendant's father was rushed to a nearby hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.

At around 9 a.m. that morning, officers responded to reports about a man with blood on his hands and clothing who was standing in the parking lot of the beloved local eatery, according to law enforcement sources cited by New York City-based Fox flagship station WNYW.

The defendant, soaked in telltale splotches of carmine and crimson, was arrested outside before officers entered the business.

""He had blood on his hands and blood on his clothing,"" Nassau Det. Lt. George Darienzo clarified during a press conference on Friday, according to Newsday, Long Island's major daily newspaper.

There, police found both victims behind the counter. Each had been stabbed in the throat, according to law enforcement.

The younger Dambrosio is said to have stabbed his mother first before turning the knife on his father, police say.

At the time of the incident, the alleged killer was estranged from his family following a domestic dispute with a sibling who took out an order of protection against him in November, according to police sources cited by New York City-based ABC flagship station WABC.

The deli itself is a staple of the community, having been owned and operated by the couple for three decades.

A loyal deli customer relayed a chilling message.

""I stabbed my parents,"" Vito Dambrosio allegedly said with a casual air as he walked out past the devoted patron cited by the newspaper.

""I've been coming here for 30 years, and this is the worst thing in my lifetime and I'm 97 years old,"" the Massapequa resident said.

The double murder quickly scandalized residents of the neighborhood and other longtime clientele, according to WNYW. Residents soon began gathering outside the deli to express their sorrow.

""They would give you the shirt off their back,"" one mourner told WNYW. ""If you didn't have money for food, they'd say, 'Pay me tomorrow, pay me next week.' I'd walk in sometimes and say, 'Man, I've got no money,' and they'd just wave it off. They made great food and they were just happy-go-lucky people. I can't see this happening. It's awful. It's really heartbreaking.""

The exact contours of the argument that led to the fatal stabbing are unclear as of this writing; however, police said the defendant has a history of violence and other interactions with law enforcement, according to New York City-based The CW flagship station WPIX.

At around 8:50 a.m. the same day, Vito Dambrosio allegedly went to a coffee shop in the area and slapped a worker's backside, police say.

The stabbing itself unfolded in the deli's back room, police say.

""I just seen him sitting by the car, just standing there, sitting there, like nothing happened,"" another witness told WPIX. ""But when they cuffed him, and he turned around, you see all the blood and stuff on his hands and everything.""

The online fundraiser reads, in part:

For more than 30 years, Tony and Angela devoted their lives to serving all of us. Straight from Italy, they built their deli with love, humility, and pure dedication. They never overcharged, never complained, and never treated anyone as just a customer. To them, we were all family.

Their English was broken, but their love spoke perfectly.

Every cup of coffee, every egg sandwich, every warm smile — all of it came from their hearts.

The defendant himself was also taken to a hospital in the area; he was arraigned on the murder charges from his bed on Friday. He pleaded not guilty during the virtual proceeding and was ordered held without bail, according to the Nassau County District Attorney's Office.

I have been going to the same dentist (a friend who I graduated high school with) for a while. She then had a baby and stopped seeing patients. I also got new insurance and her office says they don't take it (she took it especially for me and/or gave me cash discounts for invisalign). I have pretty good teeth, but I grind because other people do not parent their children (teacher here). Suddenly, yesterday, I noticed a sensitive spot that I poked with my finger (spot #1 in the cartoon), and looked in the mirror and brown spot on my back left molar near the gumline. I emailed every dentist I could find and had no luck getting a dentist who takes my insurance (UFT for NYC teachers). Tomorrow I am going to email one and hope she can take me same day or next day. BECAUSE I woke up this morning to ANOTHER BROWN SPOT (#2 in the cartoon) on the tooth next to it! Same place! I brushed like mad with 5000 flouride and nanohydroxyapatite, and have been going without my night guard because I feel like no matter how much I clean it, it never smells completely clean. Yes I floss either every day or every other day since I've had the invisalign put in which was 6 years ago.

I recently cut milk out of my 2 cups of coffee because it gives me tonsil stones that never stop for 72 hours, they upset my stomach above all else (I get a stomach churning feeling, nevermind when they pop out when I'm speaking \[they're also stinky\]). Could this be why? See image. I have also signed up for NYU Dental and praying they can take me. Went to a new place out of desperation last month for a regularly scheduled cleaning \[again, nobody takes my insurance and they lied and said they did\] and it was the worst dentist appointment and cleaning I have had in a while, I left feeling my teeth were still dirty and paid $50 for no reason >:\[.

It rains, it's grey and windy and my neighbourhood is filled with people who seem miserable.

I hate staying at home on the weekends so I got myself to my local coffee shop. I dressed casually: jeans, an old Star Wars t-shirt and a warm pink cardigan. I decided to put on my old gazelles coz they're pink, so they match the cardigan and they're not yet entirely worn out.

And boy was I wrong. Now I'm sitting in the coffee shop, my favourite table next to the floor-to-ceiling glass wall (or just a window? What is it?) and a Christmas tree, and I'm drinking my favourite bitter coffee (had better ones tbh, but for this place it'll do), and my feet are completely soaked from the rain. I did not step in any puddles on my way here.

I suppose this is the last day of my good old gazelles. Or at least the last *rainy* day, coz it's just so difficult to throw away shoes until the holes in them are gaping and more than just tiny.

Shes driving in what seems like some countryside area and she is driving really erratically. Eventually she goes into a little town and attempts to park in I think a coffee shop parking lot but ends up getting t-boned by another car. The woman driving the other car stumbles out and the young girl throws her into the trunk of her car, grabs a bystander and also throws him into the passenger seat and speeds off leading to a part 2 I think.

I am doing OMAD with 2 caloric beverages and that means:  
\- At 8 and 11 - low caffeine coffee with 50g butter and 25ml MCT c8 (more or less - I have never measured exactly - just by eye) and small spoon of organic cocoa  
\- At 17 full meal - usually grounded beef (1.2-2.2g/kg of body mass) or fish (sardines in olive oil or doradas from owen) always few eggs, some raw milk cheese on top, everything sprinkled with good quality olive oil. For veggies raw organic sauerkraut, water salt cucumbers, olive oil garlic.

For exercise I do it always by the trigger - for example - going to the toilet - 10 pushups, going to living-room - 5 pull-ups, waiting for coffee to brew 20 slopes, stuck in a call - 50 dumbbell reps. (atomic habits xD )

With this I was able to go to 4.5 ketones (blood) If I do one full day of fasting, but usually it hangs between 1,5 and 2,5.

Blood-work looks good (since I did it I have increased B12 and D3 intake with ADEK), a bit higher cholesterol, I am adding more omega3 now into diet. 

HPLC - 12,49 umol/l  
Cholesterol overall - 316 (triglycerides 65, LDL 238, non-LDL 250)  
Insuine 4.4 mU/I  
Testo O41 - 539

Supplements:  sodium, potassium, magnesium, B complex + B12 and lots of water during the day. I use a pinch of mined raw salt for each glass of water during the day - trying to keep it consistent - every 1-2 hours. Potassium and magnesium (glycinate) in the morning and evening.  
I have also started supplementing copper biglycinate 2mg/day  
My approach - I suplement 1 week, then 1 week off.  
When I feel low on energy - pinch of salt with glass of water solves the problem.

Results that I have observed - most came within 6 months from starting, the it improved with time:  
\- brain fog completely gone - I feel like I am 20yo again - while on MCT-C8 - even better  
\- body inflammation - non-existent anymore (I had few broken bones and inflammation in those areas)  
\- sleep improved dramatically, I sleep 7-9h, before I could do 5-6 and was always tired  
\- stress levels decreased - I feel much more calm, can focus on meditation easily  
\- motivation and learning capabilities - increased  
\- some digestive issues I had dramatically decreased, I had recurrent diarrhea for few years before I started, now I have perfect poo and do the toilet business in 2 min, not 15 like in the past - also I withdrew hemorrhoids I noticed those started appearing before my journey. (Also the Squatty potty helped a lot)  
\- my body type went from weak to muscular due to regular short training sessions - t-shirt size from loose L to tight XL with lean muscular - my wife is overwhelmed xD

I am a software dev who pivoted from electronics engineering (couldn't land a chip job after graduation, sadly). Been obsessed with semicon since I was a kid watching Nvidia and AMD tear it up.

**Why I'm here:** After talking to 10+ fabless engineers, two problems kept coming up: verification hell and foundry coordination nightmares. The verification issue fascinates me most.

**My understanding (correct me if wrong):** Chips need testing against billions of scenarios pre-manufacturing. One missed bug = millions wasted on scrapped batches. I've heard designers spend \~70% of dev cycles on verification using tools like Cadence/Synopsys that are expensive and surprisingly manual.

**Questions for you all:**

1. Is verification really 70% of your time? What makes it so tedious?
2. What's the most manual/repetitive part you wish a tool could automate?
3. How's your actual experience with Cadence/Synopsys? Do they live up to the price tag?

Bro. I’m not trying to be dramatic but WHY is it ALWAYS one cashier at peak hours and WHY is the one person in front of me acting like they just unlocked a new questline in Skyrim???

I just watched a grown man:

Forget his pump number

Walk back outside to check

Come back in

Decide he actually wanted DEF

Then remembered he also wanted to use points

Then the card declined

Then he switched cards

Then asked about a receipt from LAST WEEK


Meanwhile there’s 12 of us in line just trying to grab a coffee and a hot dog before our clock nukes our whole day.

I swear some drivers hit the register like:
“Yeah let me refuel three trucks, solve my loyalty rewards, negotiate peace in the Middle East, and maybe grab a roller dog while I’m at it.”

And the cashier? SOLO. Just out here fighting for their life. No backup. No reinforcements. Just vibes and a barcode scanner.

Like damn man — have your pump number ready, have your card ready, have your life together for 45 seconds. This is not the time for memory loss and financial planning.

Truck stop checkout should be: ✅ Beep
✅ Pay
✅ Get out

Not: ❌ Beep
❌ Confusion
❌ Side quest
❌ Flashback episode
❌ Manager called
❌ Time dilation

If you take more than 90 seconds at the counter during rush hour, I’m mentally revoking your CDL. 😤

End rant. I’m going back to my truck before I lose it over a taquito.

Main symptoms were bloating, constipation, gerd, stomach pain, extreme fatigue - etc.

I did a round of neomycin and rifamixin first. It helped but didn’t cure. Then I tried antimicrobials including Fc cidal and Dysbiocide with the same result. Then we did two rounds of 250mg Flagyl, that made a HUGE difference for me. 

Along with using low fodmap, consuming a lot of fiber, prioritizing probiotics like kefir and kimchi and making my own L reuteri yogurt from Super Gut, I got my motility really moving and symptoms have gone down. I still have flares so I know I still have some bugs in my gut but I am so much better than just a year ago.

I’ve pretty much figured out myself that the root cause was -

Extremely high cortisol from overtraining and stress - I do HIIT frequently and work a manual labor job. 

Overconsumption of coffee and low stomach acid (used to drink two pots or more a day - I’m a truck driver lol) 

I also had food poisoning twice (back to back) a few years ago and my doc thinks that’s what started this whole party. 

Digestive enzymes, betaine hcl and apple cider vinegar with meals help so much along with a low fodmap, high protein and fiber diet. But I still occasionally have symptoms if I go off my diet, overtrain or drink too much coffee.

Now my plan is to take a break from any heavy lifting or HIIT training and quit drinking coffee for 6 weeks, and do the carnivore diet again - beef, butter, salt and water for 30 days. Then reintroduce kefir, kimchi and add one vegetable a week to repopulate my gut biome with pre and probiotics moving forward from there. 

I’m hoping this will finally fix it once and for all. What do you guys think?",2,1765114908.0,SIBO,2,1.0,False

Then I was diagnosed with autism a year ago and it made sense. 

I ironically work in an autism center for autistic children. 

I used to like my job. My boss hired her younger cousin to work there and everything changed.

She’s befriended a few other women there, and she’s super nice to them. But despite how nice I am to her, always offering to help out, she just doesn’t like me. It’s the same vibe I get from the mean girls in middle school who didn’t like me because I’m nerdy and socially awkward. When I’ve mentioned liking Harry Potter or things like that, she’ll get this smirk on her face and say “I never understood people liking that.” We like different things and that’s fine but she puts down things I like. 

My bosses all love her. The other staff love her. I’m the only autistic person working there, and I’m the only “nerdy” person working there. All the other women are into coffee, shopping, bars, normal stuff that I wish I could be into but I’m just not. 

I wish I could ignore her but she seems to have it out for me. Any time I don’t immediately do something she tattles on me. Like my kid spilled some crumbs and ended up crying, so I took him to his room to help him calm down before we cleaned up. The only other person in the room was her, and then minutes later my boss is scolding me for not cleaning up. 

My old friend who quit, she caught her and the boss shit talking her for calling out one day too. 

I’m just tired of this. It feels like I’m in middle school again. I know I can be unnerving because of my lack of facial expressions, monotone voice, but I try my best to fake it. I really think I do a good job, I mean my bosses argued with me that I’m not autistic at first, but my main boss gets on me about it, saying I’m not faking good enough for the kids. I just feel like nothing I do is enough to be liked. I wish I could change my perspective and just not care or be confident despite the pushback. 

My director (boss of my boss) told me I deserve to be more confident. But how can I be with all of this going on? I feel so unliked and I feel like I can’t see anything good about myself. 

I wish I could just start over at a new job but that’s not an option financially, this job pays almost double of any job in the field and I’m living paycheck to paycheck. I have a year before I can move into a cheaper living situation so I have to stick it out for now. I just don’t know how to get through this not feeling like the weird unliked girl all over again.

I don't think I even need to put on another 21mg nicotine patch. We'll see as the day progresses. But as of right now, this 2mg lozenge is plenty. I'll probably spit it out.
It's 2007. I'm 16 and after a couple of after school parking lot cigarettes with my ""cool art friends"" I've instantly transformed into an old French lady chainsmoker. I smoke inside. I have a full sized glass ashtray fused to my dashboard. Cigarettes are my entire personality. After 15 years of that, I can't breathe when I wake up. I quit with the help of a very strong magic mushroom chocolate bar. I watched myself light cigarette after cigarette while I was tripping and became so disgusted with myself. It was like I had a mouth full of ashes. Weeks later everyone in my house is still smoking A LOT. Stress at work starts to stretch me thin, and, in an effort to stay away from cigarettes I buy myself a vape. Of course, quickly after I finally get used to it, my vaping is completely, hopelessly, ridiculously out of control. Since I could still breathe, I figured it was fine. A few instances of losing it, breaking it, running out of juice at inopportune moments, and I can't stand the hold this thing has over me. Plus I'm considering trying for a baby, and would prefer to have this quit out of the way before I deal with all those physical changes. First few days of wearing the patch I still had INTENSE cravings I swear every single minute. When I fell asleep all I could dream about was CIGARETTES. Me, smoking cigarette after delicious cigarette (only actually delicious in dream world lol). I've been sleeping about 10-11 hours a night which is INSANE and I've definitely been eating a bit too much. This morning, I woke up early like my usual self before quitting, having slept a normal amount. I didn't have the empty nagging to hit the vape immediately when I woke up, or during my entire cup of coffee. I just drank it???? I listened to that Allen Carr thing yesterday but didn't finish it all the way, a few points really hit home. Anyway, I just wanted to say just not putting any vape like thing in my mouth for five days, and telling myself over and over ""I'm free"" every time I have a craving, appears to have actually done something wonderful. I've never felt this way in my life, always deprived or longing... I feel like... A nonvaper. When the cravings return, I'm going to cling to this feeling, remember how wonderful the freedom felt this morning, and keep going. We can do this!!!!! ",3,1765114867.0,QuitVaping,2,1.0,False

One night, I opened the app, chatted with this guy, and we ended up doing it in his car. After nun, we strolled around UP and honestly, nagulat ako how good our conversation was. As in “hindi lang to pang hook-up” vibes. We exchanged soc meds prolly for a 2nd meet up). It was raining pa, so he literally waited with me until I booked Angkas before niya ako iniwan.

We didn’t talk regularly after that, but one random night, we suddenly had this really good, open, honest conversation. Then tuloy-tuloy na. Days of natural, effortless talking. Eventually, we met for the second time. Nakakatawa pa kasi it was supposed to be a quick meet pero pag-akyat ko sa car… tinakas ako sa work ko. 🤡 Out ko is 5pm, 4:30pm pa lang nun, so ayun. Hahaha.

And siyempre, as you’d expect from two consenting adults… naganap ulit. Afterwards, I told him I had to get back to the office to finish something, so he dropped me off.

Then one day, I jokingly asked, “Uy baka may jowa ka ah?”

When he said “yes,” kinilabutan ako. As in legit. Hindi ko alam maffeel ko kasi I never dreamed of being a kabit nor destroying a relationship.

I asked where his partner was.
He said La Union.
He admitted he struggles with LDR so he seeks comfort from people who are near.

We spent the whole night talking about it. He even said he’s willing to break up with his boyfriend for me. But I told him no. I don’t want to be Marian Rivera in a world full of Karylle. Char.

He didn’t want me to let go. He even said “wait for me.” I told him that’s unfair to me and unfair to his partner.

What shocked me more is when he said he’s doing this because he once got cheated on, and now he wants to experience what the other side feels like.
Sabi ko na lang na he can’t justify his actions just because it happened to him.

And yes, you can hate me for this, but I agreed to a third meet-up. We had a coffee.Wholesome naman. We talked properly about everything: him, his partner, their set-up. He said hindi niya mahihiwalayan yung partner niya because the guy threatens to unalive himself if ever hiwalayan siya.

At that point, I told him na I cannot live with this kind of set-up. Hindi na rin siya makapag-salita nun. Kawawa lang din partner mo kako. 

He dropped me off somewhere easy to book. And yes, this was the bad part, we kissed. A long, hard kiss. Tinutodo ko na kasi I knew that was the last time I’d see him.

After that, days passed. Minimal chats. Until I finally got the courage to say it directly na

I don’t want this anymore.
It’s unfair to me, unfair to his partner.
Hindi ko deserve ‘to.
And most of all, hindi rin deserve ng partner niya.

He’s a messed up guy right now, but I really hope he pours all that energy into fixing his relationship, not finding comfort from strangers.

To the LGBTQ brothers out there:
It’s already rare to meet someone serious. Please don’t cheat. Don’t microcheat. Don’t middle-cheat. Don’t cheat at all.

And yes, I also made mistakes by continuing even after I found out. Inner me wanted to fight for him because for me, the connection was real but my principles won. I refuse to steal someone’s place.

I’m ready for judgment if ever. 🙇‍♂️

I’ve lived in London for 10 years and he recently spent a month here so I’m thinking of more quirky, unique, hidden gem experiences as opposed to the classic London must see spots. He will be arriving on the morning of the 11th around 10am and will have to leave for the airport at around 7am on the 12th.

I am keen on some good food recommendations, especially spots that are cosy with beautiful and eclectic interiors, also maybe some reccomendations for live music (jazz or a nice listening bar kind of vibe), LGBTQ friendly suggestions too! Of course it’s the festive season so I feel like the visit wouldn’t be complete without a visit to a Christmas market. And finally, any beautiful arts & culture spaces, I recently came across a place called Ibraaz, which is a new arts and culture space with exhibitions, a cafe, a bookshop and library, and that seems like a beautiful and interesting spot. Coffee is very important to both of us, we are Ecuadorean and Kenyan, so coffee suggestions are very welcome! I think we will be looking to visit spots mostly around Central and East, simply so we can get the most out of the short time together (but still open to suggestions from all over as I’ll add them to my list for the future!)

I’d really appreciate the help but also I think it would be really fun and interesting to know how my fellow Londoners would choose to spend 24 hours in this vibrant and beautiful city, and of course how you would choose to share it with a loved one!",1,1765114705.0,visitlondon,2,1.0,False

1pgijfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1pgijfl/eternal_lease/,Eternal Lease,"Things had been rough ever since my mother passed. I fell into a deep depression; I wouldn’t eat,  couldn't sleep, and I wouldn’t even watch television. My phone became obsolete as I just sat in my room, disassociated. Stifled cries from my brother's room and the strong scent of alcohol that had overcome my poor father drove me to the brink of madness. At the funeral, my dear old dad was astonishingly intoxicated. No one wanted to say anything to him because he was a grieving man; it’s not like people didn’t have a process, you know. It was different with my dad, though. Before my mother's passing, he was stone-cold sober, hadn’t even touched a drop of alcohol since his teenage years when, even then, he rarely drank. He had met my mom back then, too. She was the love of his life; every ounce of effort he put into his life following their meeting was entirely for his queen. He bought her their first home with his own money, ensuring and promising my mother that she would never work again. 
.
 With my mother's love and father's support, my brother and I made it through school with perfect attendance and excellent grades. Well, *I* made it through school. My brother was only in the 7th grade when she passed. In the months that followed her death, I think we all just sort of…stopped caring, and I think that took a real toll on the attendance and grades for my little brother.  We were all hurting. 

That’s the thing, though, I can’t say I felt pain. All I’ve felt since her passing is emptiness. A deep, gripping void that screams at me that my mother is no longer here. Don’t get me wrong, I spent countless nights crying and screaming at the sky to please just give me my mom back. “Why did you take her?” “Please just kill me so I can have her back.” You know the spiel.    Never once through my grief did I feel the support from what was left of my family. I got some scattered hugs and condolences at her funeral, along with the days that followed, but those quickly faded. In the times that I needed it most, I had no one. My father didn’t care to talk to me, and my brother hardly even came out of his room. The boost that a simple hug from my dad would’ve given me is unimaginable. If I could’ve just had a measly conversation with the man, I could’ve forced myself not to be so weak. I would’ve had more of a reason to stay, hell, my brother was only 12 years old- he should’ve been the reason for me to stay, but I was weak. 
	
I tried to be strong, though. I tried to be a support beam for my younger brother, and I know just how much my father needed me at a time like that, but fuck me, man, I needed support too. Every time I tried to talk to Dad, it’d turn into an argument and would end up with him drunkenly storming out of the house, further traumatizing my already broken brother, further pushing me to my decision. I am so unbelievably selfish for what I’ve done. 
	
I just couldn’t do it anymore. I couldn’t deal with the inky black cloud hanging over my household. So I did the only thing I could think of in my fragile state, and left. I spent countless nights searching the internet for a place to live, and it was so damn tedious that I almost gave up. I mean, I was barely graduating high school and grieving over the loss of a parent, who wouldn’t be having a hard time, right? I’d looked at every regular posting I could find and even drove around for a couple of hours scanning neighborhoods and apartment complexes for a place I could afford. As you can imagine, I had no luck with that. I persisted, though, and eventually found an apartment on Craigslist. Of course, I was going to have a roommate, but 2 bedrooms and 2 baths for a mere $650 a month? Are you kidding me? I responded to the listing as soon as possible. I wanted to be smart. I wanted to make sure that whatever I was getting myself into was something I’d be capable of handling. I was going to be smart, and damn it, I was going to grow into the man my mom knew I could be. 
	
I began to get a little nervous when, after 5 hours, I still hadn’t gotten a response to my inquiry. I started to think that it had been too good to be true or that another tenant had responded before I’d gotten the chance to. Those thoughts quickly diminished, however, when I got the chime of a Craigslist notification on my cellphone. The message was… odd to say the least. They hadn’t bothered to respond to my original question: ""Hey, is this room still available? I’d love to rent.” 

Instead, the response I got was a date and time for me to meet with them and tour the home. That’s all the information that was given to me; the message just read, “Meet with me tomorrow at 8. We’ll get you a tour of the house and see if you’re the right candidate for the position. Have a blessed day.” I don’t know what I was thinking, not questioning the whole “candidate for the position” thing. At the time, it just seemed like the normal thing a landlord would say. I guess that was just my dumb teenage brain not fully being able to process when something was suspicious, and looking past it has proved to be the worst mistake I have ever made. 
	
But alas, tensions were building in my family, and I had no intention of sticking around my old house any longer than I had to. I went to sleep that night with a slight feeling of confidence. I was on the path to putting my life together and growing up and into the adult world.  I was a bit nervous, admittedly, and scared, even, for that matter. But I knew that this step I was about to take was my first step towards fixing myself. 
	
The next day, I eagerly waited for the time to come for me to go and tour the listing. The day dragged on because of how excruciatingly long I had to wait to meet up with this person. 7 o’clock finally rolled around, so I hurriedly left the house. I mean, I didn’t want to so much as chance being late, so I figured I’d get there at around 7:30 and sort of scope the place out, I guess. I imagined it wouldn’t be too much of a bother because I figured that since the owner wanted to meet at such a late hour, it must be because that’s when they’d be off work, so I shouldn’t be intruding on anything. 
	
As I made my way over, I couldn’t help but think about my mom. She would be so proud if she saw me right now. She’d know that her son was raised right and had grown into a man making “adult moves” as she’d call it. The thought of her smile put a slight smile on my face. I got lost in the thoughts of our happy childhood memories and had almost completely zoned out, making the drive feel like it lasted a mere 5 minutes. 
	
Upon arriving, I couldn’t help but feel a slight sense of disbelief; the house was impressively well-kempt for the part of town it was in. A quaint little townhouse painted a deep oceanic blue with a budding flower bed expanding from porch to porch. The lawn was cut perfectly, and a waist-high white picket fence hugged the property's perimeter. It was nice. One porch was lined with potted plants and had a nice little welcome mat in front of the door, while the other was completely bare. That’s the one I assumed I’d be renting. I know I said that I was gonna be getting there early to be scoping the place out, but the truth is all I did was sit in my car and play around on my phone until it was time for the meeting. 8 o’clock came around, and I didn’t spot any new vehicles pulling in. Nobody was roaming the sidewalk, and I didn’t even see a light on throughout the entire street. My initial thoughts were that he was just running a bit late and that he’d be pulling in at any second, and those thoughts held me over until about 8:30.
   
 Once 8:30 came around and there was still no sign of the renter, I made the decision that I was going to just leave. My conscience was already eating at me about my brother and dad, and I figured that maybe this was a sign to go back to them. A chance for a second chance, if you will. 
   
 I threw my car in drive and began to pull off when a man stepped out from *inside* the empty side of the home. He was waving me down, beckoning me not to drive off just yet. So I put my car back into park and stepped out. 
   
 “Hey, man, how’re you doing? I was wondering when you’d finally come knock; didn’t expect you to try and leave,” he said with a slight chuckle. “I thought the entire place was empty, man, what the hell?” 
 
“Welp. I can see why you’d think that, with how the place is shaped up, but no, we’re here, buddy. Come on over, let’s have a look at the place.” 

He had a kind of confidence about him, a draw that created a sort of underlying comfort. He reached back behind him and flipped a light switch, and the entire porch became illuminated. I could finally put a face to the voice, and that face was *made* for that voice. Picture every cool grandpa ever. That’s this guy.  Or at least how he looked, deep down, this guy was an absolute masochist disguised as a civilian. 
    
However, as of this moment, he was nothing more than a simple landlord who preferred to meet his clients after sunset…for some reason…? You can see what I meant by “I let my mom down” with my absolute lack of survival skills on this one. Anyway, I stepped up onto the porch and shook his hand. He had a..wildly impressive grip. 
     
He introduced himself as “Bal” and the only thing I could think was, “wow..that’s a crazy name for a white guy.” 

“My friends just call me B, and I suppose with us being new neighbors and roommates, we may as well get acquainted as friends,” he said. “Come on, let me show you the place.” 
I stepped inside, closely followed by the old man who came in, hands in his pockets with a sort of, “This is it. What do you think?” look on his face. 
      
“Welp. This is it. What do you think?” he asked, bringing meaning to his expression. “I think it’s perfect,” I replied, truthfully. Because honestly, it was perfect. It was tight, sure, but it was a kind of coziness that embraced instead of smothered. “You got the washer and dryer there,” he said, pointing to the enclosed space to the far left of the room. “Hope you don’t mind, we’ll have to share that. Oh, but don’t worry, I won’t be too much of a hassle, and I’m fine with a trip to the laundromat every now and again.” 
     
“And obviously right there’s the kitchen. The bedroom is your living room and dining room.”

    .
It was a bit of a strange premise, having to let B come in whenever he needed to wash his clothes. I just figured it was a price to pay for a good deal, so whatever the matter, I was okay with it. 
      
 “Oh, hey, B,” I announced. “When I asked about this place on Craigslist, I was told this meeting would determine if I was ‘the right candidate for the position.’ What’s the deal with that?”
     
 His charismatic eyes darkened, but the warm grin that had been pasted on his face this entire time didn’t move an inch.
    
 “Well, we had to make sure you weren’t just some lunatic junky off the streets, now didn’t w,e son? We can’t have just anybody coming in here thinking they can use it as their next place to get high and party like it’s 1999. But don’t worry, you haven’t done *anything* that makes me think you may not be worthy of these keys.” I stared at him blankly, as he stared at me. “Unless you’ve killed somebody… Have you ever killed anyone before Jacob?” 
       
The question hit me like a slap in the face, so much so that I sort of had to shake my head to make sure I was hearing him right. 
      
“Uhh..no...?” I replied, shakily. 

The old man continued to stare at me for a moment. His appearance was almost wax-figure-like. I could’ve sworn I saw sweat beads form right at the edge of his hairline.

 Suddenly, he snapped back into his body with a, “Ahhaha, I’m just messin with ya, boy. C’mon, take a joke, here look; I knew you were coming tonight, so I grabbed us a 6 pack so we could get acquainted if you so happened to want to rent. But that’s the thing, you gotta let me know- do you really want this place? Plenty of other lookers out there that would swoop this deal up in a heartbeat.”
    
 “I uhh..” I thought back on what it was like in my family home. All the misery that was swirling around the atmosphere like a bad storm waiting to crack open. “I can always visit them,” I thought to myself.
    
 “Yeah. Yeah, I think I’m gonna take it.”  


B’s eyes lit up as he clasped his hands together, “Perfect,” he shouted. “Now come on let’s sit out here and have a few cold ones, what do ya say,” he asked as he slapped me on the shoulder
   
 B and I sat out on that porch for about three solid hours just shooting the breeze and chatting it up. Very interesting guy, he had all sorts of stories to tell. His eyes had such an ancientness about them that was well beyond his years. When he spoke, it was like he was staring out over a meadow of the earth's finest flowers and reminiscing on how he used to pluck them for his long-since-forgotten first love. 
     
I let him know about what life was like for me and how things had been looking for me back home, and he listened very intently. “So is life, son. So is life. You can’t stop it, and if you try to, God shows you why you shouldn’t have.” 
     
I honestly had no earthly idea what he meant by that. “Let me ask you, though; you mentioned how you felt empty after her passing, and that’s why you’re here, maybe your brother and dad could’ve been feeling the same way. I mean, what’s being drunk constantly if not a cry for help? And your poor ol’ brother, God bless his soul, I can’t imagine what he’s going through.” 
      
Those words struck me. It was like I felt the full weight of my family's grief in my chest, and I fought to hold back tears, but I think he noticed. “Yeah, well, I mean- sure, when you put it that-” he cut me off.  “Ah, come on, buddy. There’s no need to get all upset now; it’s not the end of the world- look, I’ll tell you what. How about tonight you get a good night's sleep- well..” he paused, making an “ehh” gesture with his hand. “As good a sleep as you can. I noticed you didn’t really have much of a bedding situation when you pulled up here.” 
     
He was right. I left home with nothing more than the clothes in my drawers, a backpack, my laptop, my phone, and my car. I was honestly more ill-prepared than I’d thought I was. “I’ve got an air mattress I used to use on camping trips a few years back; wouldn’t mind letting ya borrow it for a while. Tonight you can get ya some sleep, and tomorrow you can go visit your brother and dad, how’s that sound?” 
     
 It sounded like a good way for me to have a real heart-to-heart with the two of them. I could sleep on my feelings for the night, then tomorrow I could go and explain to them the reasons why I’m having to step away like this. 
    
 “Good,” I replied. “That sounds good.” 

“Well, alright then. Let's get ya settled in for the night.”

He got up and disappeared into his side of the house, and I could hear him rummaging through boxes or whatever for a few minutes. 
    
 As I waited, I couldn’t help but feel a tad bit excited for myself. I was in my own process, but I was making the absolute best I could out of it. I was excited to actually connect with my dad and brother again, as jarring as that felt, but I was excited to really get what I needed off my chest. I stared at the bottle in my hand, and a slow smile crept across my face as a deep feeling of warmth settled in my chest. 
    
 B returned holding a wadded-up ball of rubber in one arm and a manual air pump in the other. “Well, there you have it.’ He proclaimed. “Now let’s get this sucker blown up.”
    
 I slept that night smack dab in the middle of the room. I say “slept” but, truthfully, I was up for a good portion of the night. First night jitters mixed in with anticipation kept me awake and aware. Aware enough to think clearly, to come up with plans on what to do next, and above all I was aware enough to *hear*. 
   
  At around 3:30 A.M., I heard what sounded like B…scolding someone. I couldn’t hear exactly what he was saying, but I could hear ferocity in his voice. It was a mixture of anger and desperation, if I had to guess, and what was off-putting to me was, in response to the scolds, I heard childlike giggling. Now I had just sat out on that porch with B for hours, and not once did I see or even hear a child, but now here it is almost 4 in the morning, and he’s screaming at one who’s, in response, laughing in his face. 
    
 “Oh geez,” I thought to myself. “Kid must’ve secretly stayed up way past their bedtime. The disrespect of that little brat laughing like that; no wonder B sounds so pissed.” 
     
After a while, the pulsing giggles came to a slow stop and were replaced by what sounded like sobs. “Must’ve put some sense in them,” I pondered, my eyes growing heavy. “Good. I hope they weren’t too bad on his nerves.” 
     

 My sleep was brief but effective, and I woke up the next morning feeling rejuvenated and ready to tackle the day. I remember having these sorts of dream flashes that were all convoluted and frantic. They were all broken, but what I remembered was incredibly vivid. I saw my mom and heard her voice again, for one. That one wasn’t really new. I’ve dreamt of my mom a lot since her passing, so I’m sort of used to it by now. I also dreamt briefly of an ocean. Looking out and seeing such profound emptiness, knowing the world that lay beneath the surface.
 
The third dream was something I’d never experienced before. You know when you’re asleep and you wake up remembering only blackness, and taking this as you not having any dreams? That’s what it was like. Only the blackness was the dream. I remember feeling the ground beneath my feet and having walls to bump into, but as I walked, they became few and far between. Eventually, it was nothing. Just sheer darkness that I could maneuver through without making any progress. It was surreal, that’s the only way I know to describe it. 
I try not to dwell on these things, though. I’ve always seen dreams as just the subconscious's way of creating visuals for emotions that you’re bottling up. 
    
I hopped in the shower, making sure the water was steaming hot as I enjoyed the feeling of having my own personal bathroom. My own personal living quarters, man, it was an amazing feeling while it lasted. 
     
I threw some clothes on, brushed my teeth, and the whole “let’s get out there and make a difference routine.”
     
As I stepped out the front door, I found B sitting out on his front porch in a lawn chair, gazing into the morning sky as though embracing the blessing that is another day. 
     
He greeted me with a dip of the pipe he was smoking, “Howdy neighbor,” he smiled. “Headed off to see your people?” 
     
“Yup. Figured now's a good a time as any.” 
    
 “Well, you have yourself a good time, then. And hey, tell your brother and paw I said hello.” he said with a nod of his head. 
    
 “Oh, you already know they’re gonna hear about you,” I said, more awkwardly than charmingly. 

    
 As I drove, I kept getting this repeating sense of dread. I’ve always had anxiety, and with my mother's passing, that was amplified by 10. I’d been learning how to shake these feelings as they come, but this one just would not budge. I broke into a cold sweat. My hands became clammy, clasped around the steering wheel. I subconsciously pressed my foot further down on the gas as my speedometer rose. 60. 70. 85. I topped out at 100 on the expressway in a hurry for some reason unknown to me.
     
I finally approached the opening to my neighborhood and felt relief wash over me. Once I made it to my house, I hopped out of the car immediately and damn near sprinted up the front steps and into the house. 
     
There was an eerie silence as I entered. The whole house had been silent for a long time, but this silence was gripping, the kind of silence that whispers everything that’s about to go wrong. 
    
“Dad,” I called out. No response. “Andrew?” Still no response. I descended further into the house, curious and anxious. There was no sign of anyone anywhere, which doubled my fear. 

“Dad, where the hell are you?” I cried out desperately. 
    
I began getting flashbacks of my mother's death. The heartbreak, the grief, the whole reason we’re in this mess to begin with, and tears welled up in my eyes. 
“Dad, come on, please tell me where you guys are,” I choked out in muted tears. Suddenly, I heard the front door fly open, followed by the absolute last thing I would’ve expected in this situation: Laughter. 
     
My dad and brother had just casually waltzed right into the house, happy as could be. Andrew was glued to his iPad while my dad carried in a McDonald's bag, so full that it drooped as the grease pooled and seeped through the bottom.

“Oh, Jacob, hi, didn’t expect you to be dropping by today,” my dad said.

“Dropping by today? Dad, what do you mean? I only just left yesterday. Is that McDonald's? You guys went and got McDonald's?”

I was astonished because we had never gone out, just the three of us, and gotten McDonald's since my mother's passing. It used to be damn near tradition: we’d load up the van and go grab a milkshake before heading to the-

“Went to the movies, too,” my brother added, looking up from his iPad.  

“Really? It’s only 12 o’clock and you guys already had time for McDonald’s *and* a movie?”

“Well, technically, the McDonald’s hasn’t been eaten yet,” Andrew remarked. 

“What exactly are you getting at here, Jacob?” asked my dad. 

“What am I getting at? Do you realize this entire process, me moving out, me working to find a way through all this sadness and grief, is because of how alone I felt in my own household? Now here you guys are, not even 24 hours after I leave, getting McDonald’s and going to the movies? Dad, you’re sober as a rock, and Andrew, since *when* do you have an iPad?” 

“Alright, Jacob, now you just need to calm down, okay? It’s not a crime for me and my son to go out for McDonald's and a film. Now I know you took your mom's passing particularly hard, but this nonsense about you leaving just yesterday needs to stop. It’s been months of me and your brother doing what *we* can to process *our* grief and sadness after you left us back in October last year.” 

I paused. It was April. I had literally *just*  set off with my measly belongings, hell, I had screamed at my dad I was leaving the night that I left, and all he responded with was a drunk grunt of acknowledgement.  What the hell was going on here? 

“Dad..are you feeling okay?”

“Just peachy, son. Are *you* feeling okay?” he asked with a glare. 

I was at a loss for words for a moment. 
“Dad, you know I left before 8 o'clock yesterday, right?” 

He and my brother both stared at me, confused. 

“No, you didn’t,” they said in unison, making me uneasy. They played it off as they glanced at one another and giggled. 

“Look, are you guys gonna keep messing with me? Because I came over so we could reconnect. I miss you guys. I wanted us to rekindle our relationship, maybe start a coffee routine or something. Heck, I like the movies,” I laughed nervously. 

“Well, I’m glad that you missed us, Jacob, but I can assure you, we haven’t seen nor heard from you since last October. I honestly thought that you were done with us, thought you had packed up and moved halfway across the country. Tried calling a number of times, but the line died every single time.” 

I pulled my phone from my pocket, demanding he call.
The phone began ringing in my hand as my dad's smiling face popped up on the screen. 

“Doesn’t seem like it’s going dead to me,” I sneered.

“Well, that’s odd,” he gawked. “That’s the first that’s happened.” 

“Alright, whatever, dad, listen; I just wanted us to work something out here. I want us to start functioning as a family again. Could we meet up sometime? Maybe on a day where you guys haven’t already gotten full on McDonald's?”

“You’re welcome to rejoin anytime you see fit, Jacob. We miss ya around here. Isn’t that right, Andrew?” 

My brother looked over with a quick nod before returning to the iPad. 

“Okay then,” I surrendered. “Well, I guess we’ll do this..Friday then?”

“Friday sounds good to me, buddy,” my dad smiled. 

“Well, I guess I’ll get back then. I love you, Dad. I’m so sorry all of this is going on. I really hope that we turn things around big time,” I said, opening the front door to leave. 

“Oh, wait, Jacob, before you go; I got some things for ya.” 

He started toward his bedroom, and I called out behind him, “Things? What things?”

I heard shuffling and rummaging come from beyond the bedroom door before my father returned, a stack of beautifully wrapped gifts in his arms.

“Your Christmas and birthday. You weren’t around for it, so I just saved it all for you. You don’t gotta open it here, I know you’d probably think that’s lame or something,” he said with a weak smile. 

I was absolutely dismayed. I stood there with my mouth agape as my father lugged the gifts into my arms, before patting me on the back and walking away with a, “Love you, son.” 

I remained glued to the floor outside my dad's room, unable to move. I felt a leering panic attack forming, and I hurried for the front door. Tossing the gifts in the backseat of my car, I got in the driver's seat and *immediately* drove to the hospital, demanding they run tests on me.

That’s where I stayed all day, getting bloodwork done along with X-rays and CT scans. Astoundingly, everything came back clean as a whistle. No grey cloud in my brain, no hallucinogens in my bloodstream. Everything was perfectly normal. 

Feeling my mind crack and fracture like a splintering board, I sat in the car dumbstruck. How could this even be possible? I had been away for one night and somehow missed 6 months of healing with my family. This had to be some sort of joke, some kind of cosmic prank being played on me in the time of my numbing grief. These thoughts rattled and circulated within my mind so loudly that before I realized it, the sun was setting, and the sky was being painted with a blazing coat of orange and red. 

Starting my car, I began my journey back to the townhome. 

When I arrived, B was in the same exact place as this morning; pipe in hand as he watched the sunset. 

I pulled into the driveway and started lugging the gifts out one by one. 

“Evening, neighbor,” B chirped.

“Oh, uh, hi B.”

“Christmas come early this year?” he laughed.

“Yeah- I mean no- I mean- Ugh, it’s a long story. Hey, would you mind giving me a hand with these?”

Without me even noticing B was already by my side, staring down at the pile of gifts on the cement driveway.

“Didn’t tell me it was your birthday, Jacob, I’d have gotten ya a gift myself.” 

Shooting him a tired look, he threw up his hands to say, “my bad, my bad”

“Some weird shit’s been going on. I think I need to settle in for the night I’ve had a bit of a crazy day. I’m sorry, I don’t mean to sound rude.” 

“Hey, hey. Not rude at all, my friend. Oh, shoot, that reminds me,” he snapped.”I actually *did* get ya a little something on accident.”

Distracted as I attempted to bundle up all the packages I could carry I responded with a disengaged, “Yeah? What’s that?” 

“Well, I just couldn’t stand knowing I left ya sleeping on that lousy air mattress last night. So, I went out to the storage unit and I brought ya a real bed that’s been locked in there for a couple of years now.  I ain’t no use for it, so figured I’d get ya off that damn inflatable.”

That was…actually quite a nice thing to do. I stared at him for a bit, eyebrows raised. 

“A bed? Like a whole bed?” 

“No, half a bed, ya dummy,” he laughed. “Of course, a full bed. C’mon, I’ll help ya inside, you can take a gander at it.” 

Taking half the gifts out of my arms and following me up the stairs, the old man waved me off as I fumbled my keys from my pocket. 

“Oh, don’t worry about that, it’s unlocked,” he said, blankly

“Oh. Well, alright then.” 

Pushing the door open, I was greeted with a twin-size bed. A matte black metal headboard and a teakwood bedframe lifted it 8 inches above the ground. The same blue comforter with black stripes and the same grey pillow cases as the first bed I’d ever slept in outside of my crib. 

“It’s not much, but hey, it’s a place to sleep,” B remarked.

His words snapped me out of the trance I was in, as my words began to stumble and falter. 

“I- this is- how’d you even,” 

B cut me off with an, “Ahh, quit your blabbering and accept the gesture, son. Now look, I’ve gotten ya one step closer to a fully furnished room, haven’t I? Looks cozy, don’t it?” 

I didn’t know what to say. Everything about this bed was exactly the same as my bed from childhood. Before I grew 3 feet, and dad insisted on my getting a new one before my 14th birthday. All I could stammer out was, “Yeah…thanks, B, this means a lot.” 

“Well, you’re welcome. Should be at least somewhat of a step up from that damn air mattress.”

“Yeah, I’m sure it will be; Look, Bal, I’m incredibly tired. It’s been a long day, I hate to shoo you off like this-”

“Like I said, son, no trouble at all. You just get your rest and do what you gotta do. Holler if you need anything.”

With that, B waved goodbye, and I shut the door, relieved.

Staring at the pile of gifts that lay carelessly on the floor, I let out a deep sigh before lugging them onto the bed to examine them. 

Each one had been wrapped so carefully, and each one bore the words, “for my son, whom I love very much,” written in black Sharpie. 

Peeling back the paper on each gift one by one, I made my way through clothes, a new pair of AirPods, a gas card; practical dad gifts. Making my way down to the last two packages, I noticed that one wasn’t wrapped like the others. It was wrapped in brown packing paper and kept together with string rather than tape. The note on this one read “To Jacob: Happy Birthday, buddy.” 

Not having readily available scissors, I pushed the box to the side and grabbed the second-to-last package. The apple-red paper glistened under the dim light that illuminated the room. 

“To my son, whom I love very much,” written across the front in black Sharpie. 

Peeling the paper back, I was greeted with a framed picture of my dad and me that my mom had taken back when I was 15. We stood there together, gazing out over the Grand Canyon, and the picture captured our amazement perfectly. 

Tears welled up in my eyes and fell onto the glass, fuck, it was a painful thing to see. 

“Don’t worry, Dad,” I thought aloud. “I’ll make things better.” 

Standing the picture up on the kitchen counter, I grabbed a knife from the sink and began cutting the string that wrapped the last package. Tearing back the paper and opening the box, I was greeted with a newspaper. 

November 6th, 2024.

I wanted to throw up. I wanted to scream, I wanted to roll over and die right there on the spot. 7 months could not have passed- there was no possible way. This had to be fake; it had to be some kind of joke. 

Grabbing my keys and attempting to storm out the door, I was dismayed to find that the door would not budge. I pushed and pushed and nothing. My shoves turned into kicks that left the door stained with black shoeprints. 

Suddenly, B came drifting in from the doorway that connected our two spaces. 

“Evening, neighbor,” he said casually with a nod. 

He carried his basket of laundry over to the washer and dryer while whistling to the tune of Andy Griffith. 

I stood horrified, noticing the crimson liquid that stained his basket of clothes. 

“B, what the fuck?! What’s going on here, man? Did YOU know about this?” I asked, waving the newspaper in his face.

Without taking his eyes off the washers opening as he shoveled in wad after wad of blood-soaked clothing, he responded with a flat and drawn-out, “yep. I knew about that.”

He continued with, “Been here a long time, Jacob. Seen a lot of people just like you come and go.”

I stood there in utter shock and awe. My feet were glued to the floor, but rage burned in my heart as I debated tackling B to the ground and hammering away at his face with my fists.

He finally put his laundry basket down and turned to face me, a twisted grandfatherly smile pasted on his face. 

“Your mom never died, son, c’mon now, use that brain of yours. You remember what got you here.” 

As if on cue, memories came rushing back to my brain with a migraine-inducing ferocity. 

Intense arguments with my parents led to my being kicked out of their house. I couldn’t get my drug problems under control, and it ended with my mother in tears as my father demanded I get off their property. I saw images from my perspective of me stealing hundreds of dollars from my mom's purse; raiding my brother's room for anything of value that I could sell for my next hit. I saw myself lying on a street corner, shivering, with a syringe sticking from my veins. 
The vivid memory showed my shivering become violent and sporadic as foam and vomit filled my mouth, and it showed that suddenly all movements stopped, and I lay stiff as a board, lifeless.

I felt dizzy. I tried to take a seat and ended up falling on my back, my vision spinning. B came into view above me, his grandfatherly grin still present across his face. The room faded to darkness, and I blacked out. 

I awoke in my bedroom. 

Not the room that I had rented, but my childhood bedroom, surrounded by my family. 

They all wore a look of grief and regret as they stood around my bed, roses in hand—my mother, as sorrowful as ever. My father shook his head at me, disappointedly, and my brother asked my mom in a curious voice, “Mommy, when will Jacob wake up?” 

B stepped in from the shadows, joining the grieving family members. 

He laughed a deep, demonic laugh, and my family's faces distorted into malice; into looks of pure hatred for me, and the roses they held morphed into sharp, pointy syringes, filled to their full capacity with a black, tar-like substance. 

Chains sprouted out from the mattress, restraining me and cutting off circulation to my arms. 

One by one, my family took turns sticking their needles into my cephalic vein and pushing down on the plunger, and filling my blood with their poison. 

I vomited repeatedly, choking and feeling like I was drowning as the bile filled my throat and lungs. I never died, though. B continued to laugh as needles kept reappearing in my family's hands, bursting with the substance. 

His face transformed, and his skin melted away. Warts and pus-filled wounds began appearing all across his body, and horns sprouted from his head.  His maniacal laughter grew more and more crazed until it reached deafening levels. 

The door to the room had long disappeared, and I was left, trapped in a room with B and his laughter, along with my family and their never-ending supply of syringes. 

Black tar has begun to seep from my pores, and I live in a constant state of overdosing.
The room has shifted as I remain chained to my bed. It started out as a perfect replica of my childhood bedroom, but as the years have dragged on, it’s morphed into a dark scape of nothingness. A single overhead light illuminates my bed, and my family circles with each passing minute, injecting me with more heroin. B’s laughter is the only thing that escapes from the darkness. A booming thunderous laughter that morphs into childlike giggles and snickers. 

The cruelest joke of it all, is that about every 10 years or so, I wake up from this nightmare. Back at home with my dad and brother, processing the death of my mother. Every single time, the grief of my mother's passing leads me back to Craigslist. To a two-bedroom, two-bathroom townhouse, where I’ll have a roommate. Watching my phone light up with the notification from Craigslist, reading, “Meet me tomorrow at 8. We’ll get you a tour and see if you’re the right candidate for the position.”",1,1765114627.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

Profile: 9/7/8 GNEM Fresher 

CAT: 96.53 %ile

Specialization: Marketing Slot: 9:45am, 5th Feb 2025

ID verified by 9:45

A case study at 10:10am was given the sheets for 20 minutes. The case study was about living with your parents as a mid-20s working individual, pros and cons. 

G1 started at 11am

Panel: P1 (Older guy, extremely lovely) and P2 (Younger guy, had a strong presence)

Candidates: F (Marketing specialization, BCom

 graduate, family business)

M1 (me)

M2 (Finance + BM specialization, BCom graduate, 30m workex in insurance)

M3 (Finance specialization, BCom graduation, fresher)

The interview started with banter, the panelists asking us to be human and let go of tense behaviour indoctrinated by coaching institutes

Asked us what they should ask to put us at ease,

F replied hobbies, and I agreed, while the rest didn't reply. 

P2 joked that only F and M1 had hobbies, and the other two didn't because they didn't say anything. So yeah, that paints the picture for the whole interview. Very chill and casual.

Another thing adding to the friendly banter is that, due to pure happenstance, M3 got rejected in G1 last year by the same panelist (P1), which he thought was his fault because he couldn't answer some finance question last time, and so the panelist joked that seeing him must've ruined M3's day (it probably did lmao)

Actual questions:

TMAY, but not in your form

F: Talked a bunch about things already in her form

M1: Talked about my passion for things and love of working with people

M2: Talked about things in this form

M3: Talked about his interests, but also things in his form

I think they should've taken the liberty to talk about things not in the form more.

Actual questions started with F, who was asked about how a company would go about measuring brand awareness.

She initially struggled to get to the point of the question, but the panelist helped her find her flow, and eventually she answered well.

Then P2 asked me about how biology would influence consumer behaviour (he initially assumed I had biology in undergrad, but I didn't, so he told me to answer what knowledge I had).

Initially, I answered with generic ideas, but he encouraged and guided me in the direction of talking specifics (particular brain parts, pathways, hormones), and I answered well.

M2 was asked about his job profile, what he does, the tools he uses, and some generic questions about implications of his insurance work, which I think he fumbled a little in answering

M3 was asked to give his views on the questions, and he didn't add that much new info, so the panelists were generally a little dissatisfied

M3 was asked some specific finance things that I have absolutely no idea about (pardon me for financial illiteracy).

Questions moved back to me, I was asked how a coping mechanism could be used in marketing, I gave some examples of guerrilla marketing and talked about creating association of peace and serenity through meditation booth in a showroom (not quite happy with it, and I think the P2 wasn't quite happy either).

F offered to add marketing tactics of Zomato, which notify you things like ""if you're lonely, why not have a sandwich?"" etc, which I think was a smart answer, and the panelists shared my feelings.

M2 was asked about his hobby of cricket, but he didn't quite answer very well (they were technical things).

F was asked about her hobbies, and P1 asked what dystopian books she read (she mentioned she was interested). She also mentioned Asura and how Ravan's perspective was presented.

The discussion grew to the whole panel with P1 talking about how anything contrary gains popularity with the new generation. We were asked to give our views on the matter. I said it was more of a matter of perceptions (how people perceive contrarian views as inherently informed, even if it isn't true), and others were asked if they agreed.

P1 remarked he would only be convinced with Asura if Ravan himself was there telling his story, to which M3 rebutted that Ram didn't write Ramayan either, which we all agreed with and laughed. I commend his wit on that one.

Then we were led to the waiting room with snacks and coffee. I'm writing this while waiting for the results.

G1 lasted for 50 mins give or take.

Verdict: The Entire group selected for G2 (After 50 mins of waiting)

It was more waiting for G2 to start, but the adcom member guiding us around was nice, and we talked for 15-20mins about the interviews, life at SPJIMR, and such, which was fun.

G2: New panel, P1 late 40s P2 mid 40s, both women, had a strong presence.

My group was F (Finance, Fresher), M1 (me), M2 (Marketing, work experience in Career Launcher)

First question: You're in an elevator with Bill Gates, you have 30 seconds to introduce yourself and tell him why you admire him

I fumbled a bit here and didn't introduce myself, mostly talked about what I like about him.

F took it in the direction of Mahakumbh (was Bill Gates in India for Mahakumbh? Idfk), so we discussed the stampede for a little bit.

M2 gave an example of a Coldplay concert, so the discussion went there. Asked about what the hot news is about Coldplay (Panelists were looking for something specific, none of us had any clue about it)

P1 asked me about my favourite new psychologist, and I didn't remember his name, but I talked about the guy behind social constructivism and the postmodernist movement. They wanted to know far more details about social constructivism, so I went on a monologue for like 5-6mins. Not sure what they thought of it.

Then we were asked our key takeaway from the case study and our stance. That's it.",2,1765114146.0,CATiim,0,1.0,False

Some people ask how I survive, how I keep going, how I still have any hope left.
It changes you. Completely.
Life gets stripped down to the absolute basics: somewhere dry to sleep, enough food to stop the shaking, staying safe, and the occasional bit of human connection.
For years I lived on £4 a day – sometimes less. That £4 had to cover food, something hot to drink, rolling tobacco, and whatever tiny comfort I could find.
I learned every trick:
Which supermarkets reduce stuff at exactly what time
The warm spots nobody talks about
How to sleep rough when it’s minus degrees and not lose toes
How to look “normal” enough that security leave you alone
How to stretch one phone charge for three days because a dead phone can mean no money and no help
Every single day is uncertainty. You wake up not knowing where you’ll sleep that night or whether you’ll eat properly. And you carry that weight 24/7.
But something weird happens after a while.
You get strong in ways housed people never understand. You learn what actually matters and what’s just noise. You stop giving a fuck about designer clothes, big TVs, or “career progression”. You realise freedom tastes better than any salary ever felt.
I’m still out here most of the time, still walking, still choosing this over going back to warehouses and rent I can’t pay.

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

I’m HCP and would really appreciate some advice, not sure if this is a right subreddit? For the past couple of months, I’ve been getting to know a doctor at work who is a few years older than me (I’m 29F). We get along well, and he’s been a bit flirty with me in a friendly /professional way.  Recently, while we were discussing medication etc., I mentioned that I really like coffee and he asked if I’d like to go out for a coffee with him. I got a bit shy and didn’t answer straight away. We then realised a senior nurse was in the room hidden behind computers so we stopped, and after he left, she commented that she has been “observing us” and that dating/flirting  with a colleague is very unprofessional in the workplace which made me very uncomfortable. Today, he messaged me again asking if I’d still like to grab that coffee, and I said yes. We’ve also texted before, so his message wasn’t anything new or unexpected. I do like him and I’m definitely interested, but I’m just not sure where the line is when it comes to professionalism. We’re both single, there’s no power imbalance, and we’ve always been respectful, friendly and professional at work, not sure how she came up with flirting ? So I’d really appreciate some guidance  is this genuinely unprofessional, or is it okay as long as we keep things appropriate in the workplace?

She had a few bags of groceries with her and went to the kitchen. She cast a glance towards Bowsette, still laying on the couch, and thought better of pestering her just yet. If what Phage had told her was true, she was part of the problem now. She busied herself with putting things away on the counter, in cabinets, and in the fridge and freezer. It helped distract her from her own self doubt and invasive thoughts and* [memories](https://youtu.be/sNJZyQ68-3c?si=wjqzhOi6wEZShMEN)*.*

*The feline woman sat on a chair in the dining area and drummed her fingers on the table. She felt restless. She'd always had a bad habit of poking her nose into situations that weren't hers, and had usually been lucky enough that they never wound up going poorly for her. This was out of her depth, though.*

*She pushed away from the table and went outside to her workshop inside a large shed. She began to tinker with the devices and technologies inside. She kept herself busy, and at first she wasn't sure what to work on, but seconds turned to minutes and she found her pace. Then those minutes turned to hours.*

*Deciding it was time to make something to eat, she went back inside to check on Bowsette. The Koopa was still laying on the couch, but had rolled on to one side and faced the back of the couch. Her braced ankle still rested on its pillow on the end table.* ""I'm going to make some dinner,"" *she announced. Bowsette didn't move, so Courser assumed she was sleeping. She headed into the kitchen and started working on getting some food prepared. In an hour she'd gotten some food made and set Bowsette's plate on the coffee table in the living room. She could eat it when she was ready, Courser supposed.*

*She slowly picked at her own food while her thoughts spun in the same circles. It was frustrating and maddening for her brain to be stuck turning its rut into an inescapable ditch, but she did her best to try and redirect her thoughts as needed. After she'd managed to finish her own plate of food, she went to check on Bowsette. She didn't seem to have moved, but her plate was empty which brought a small smile to Courser's face. When she reached for the empty plate, a sudden voice startled her.*

""Why are you helping me?""

*Courser made a small jump at the sudden question. Bowsette's head turned to look over her shoulder. Her usually vibrant sapphire orb was dim and lightly glazed over. She lacked vitality she normally would have had.* ""Do I need a reason?"" *Courser countered.*

""Yes,"" *Bowsette retorted.* ""Nobody ever helps me for no reason. Kamek raised me to be his weapon to rule the world for him to live vicariously though me. The Mario Brothers helped me so I could destroy our mutual enemies. And regardless of what Nicole thinks, I'm not stupid. I know she's not helping me out of the goodness of her heart. I'm being used by her the same as everybody else."" *Her head turns back away while she waited for Courser's answer.*

""Look, I'm not some grand schemer that needs to take over the world or save it. I just do what I can with what's in front of me. My reason for helping you is because it's the right thing to do."" *Courser couldn't help but feel a little frustrated by the accusation, but she knew that Bowsette wasn't in a good headspace at the moment.* ""I'm going to keep helping you. I don't want anything. I don't need anything."" *She turned to take the dishes back to the kitchen. She could hear a soft shuddering sigh from Bowsette, but said nothing.*

*The days passed much the same. Every meal Bowsette had questions for the feline, and every answer followed the same pattern. Nothing seemed out of place, which put the Koopa Queen on guard. It was too honest. It was too selfless. She'd only ever met one other who was kind like this, but he was weak and depended on others in the extreme. He didn't have the power or resources to shake the world, at least not yet, and it let him be genuine. Why did this blasted cat get to enjoy that? She knew why she didn't; her karmic scales were pretty tilted in the direction of the universe telling her 'get fucked' and it was her own fault. Had Courser really just... lived? Did she really have power that existed only to be used when necessary?*

*The sun rose more than a week after Bowsette had literally crashed into Courser's life and the Cheetah found the couch vacant. Out the window and in the front yard she could see Bowsette standing in the grass staring at the sky, and just over the trees she could see the glittering crack that Dark Bowsette had fallen through. She stepped out onto the front lawn and saw that Bowsette was standing on her bad ankle. She started to say something, but Bowsette lifted a hand and cut her off.* ""I need to do this,"" *the giant woman said softly.*

*She bounced gingerly from one foot to the other, testing it at first before she moved on to walking around, then running and jumping. She launched herself high into the air and landed with a crash, making sure to land with most of her weight on the bad ankle to see if it had properly healed. As far as she could tell, her injury had fully recovered. So why was she so nervous?*

""How do you feel?"" *Courser asked as she sat on the edge of the porch.*

""Not great. Not bad, but not great."" *Bowsette made a few experimental martial arts kicks with her left leg, then her right, and back and forth to gauge the differences. Each kick was accompanied by a deep thump as her foot tore through the air. She took a long, deep breath and let out another sigh.* ""I'm not used to this feeling of uselessness. I've never been beaten this badly before. I've never had a fight where I was so mercilessly torn apart. It makes everything up to now seem..."" *She paused while she remembered all the fights she'd ever had with Mario and others.* ""It's like it was all just fun and games. Like I was just pretending and we, as grown ass adults, were more or less playing cops and robbers and I was always happy to be the robber because it let me do whatever I wanted.""

*She walked back to the house and sat beside Courser with her tail in her lap.* ""Every step here has shown that this place uses different rules. This place plays for keeps."" *She takes another breath and another pause. She begins to fidget with her tail, picking at the scales and spines. Her mouth opened and closed several times while she organized her thoughts. She was silent for a long while and Courser sat there beside her patiently waiting.* ""I'm... sorry. For how I've treated you. It wasn't right or fair.""

*Courser hadn't expected that, but she smiled up at Bowsette.* ""Don't worry about it. You were going through a rough time. I wasn't going to judge you too harshly.""

*Bowsette suddenly wrapped her arms around Courser and gave her an almost crushing hug.* ""Thank you."" *She suddenly let go and hopped away like nothing happened.* ""I need to go home,"" *she blurted out.* ""I need to figure out how to fix the problems of my past."" *Her words came out quickly and in a jumble. She quickly sprinted into the forest leaving a confused Courser behind. Was Bowsette... blushing...?*

*Courser shook her head. That was weird. She climbed up to her feet and went back inside the house. It felt emptier than before without Bowsette there. The stack of neatly folded clothes from when Bowsette first arrived was still there, which Courser found odd. Maybe she meant to come back for them later? Time would tell.*",2,1765113828.0,WorldOfMobiusMerged,1,1.0,False

1pgi6cz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMallWorld/comments/1pgi6cz/anyone_been_forced_to_take_strange_tests_within/,Anyone been forced to take strange tests within Mallworld?,"Last night I dreamt I was in an area of the mall that looked like half a food court and a bunch of small shops. There was a lot of neon signs.  The signs seem to be in Japanese, I think.  I was a with a group of people and it seemed like we were all on a tour. A  blonde man in a business suit showed up and told us that we were all finally there and it was time to get to business. Right there in front of my eyes, a section of the mall opened up. There was nothing there but a solid grey wall. But when the man pointed towards the direction we were going, the wall vanished with some kind of pixelation effect.  Like an old video game.  This new wing of the mall had stores with lots of neon.  But I couldn't tell what they selling in them. We went outside and got into a limo.

The limo didn't drive very far as it took us around a circular path to another building.  When we got down the blonde man told us to get inside. I looked back to mall but instead up and above the building.  I could see a very tall tower in the distance. Not too far. But close.  The area we were in was enclosed. Building on every side. We had come from the mall, but now we were outside the hospital. I don't know what the other buildings were. There was also no way to get out of this place.   We entered the building and went through several glass doors and then down a hallway. The man told us to enter a room.

We went into the room and found ourselves in what looked like a conference room.  A large wooden table was in the middle.  At the far back of the room were two smaller rooms. one appeared to be filled with pastries and coffee.  the other was  like a small waiting room. there was also a small hallway between the two that led to a door.  various potted trees were here and there in the room. On one side were large windows that looked out to the other buildings. I could see the mall and I could see the large tower. It was dark, gloomy. But I could see people looking out the windows. they seem to be working in labs or computer rooms.  Looking out these windows was impossible. Since outside in the hallway,  it appeared there had been other rooms along the way. Yet, here there were windows looking to the outside.

The blond man then told us all to sit down. We were all going to be taking tests.  He never told us what the tests were. I never found out myself. It was like the dream prevented me from seeing the tests or even remembering them.  But he told us he would be leaving us alone for now. He walked out the door and locked it from the outside. We were stuck here. In the center of the table was an old timey radio. We were all angry about being here. Suddenly a man's voice came through the radio and it sounded robotic.  It told us that if we wanted to get out we had to pass the tests within the room. It was like an escape room or something.  Suddenly we heard a commotion outside in the hallway. The man was yelling at a woman to try and stop them from coming in and killing us.  It seemed like there were some kind of military group trying to get to us.  the man sent the woman away to deal with them and slow them down. But he still would not let us out. i started to look around the room for these tests but see a thing.

we could hear gunfire outside in the hallway and it was getting closer.  We were all panicking. There was this beautiful woman sitting several chairs away from me. She had long light brown hair and brown eyes. But she seemed to want to do something about all this, but she couldn't. Like she couldn't move. AT that point I got up and basically yelled ""F this"". I ran to the hallway in the back and tried to open the door but it was locked.  i then noticed something that was not there before. It looked like a podium but with various buttons and what looked like two large rectangular metal plates on the wall above it.  The woman came up next to me and we somehow both figured out that we need to make one of plates hot and other cold.  I don't remember how we did it but we solved it and opened the back door.

But that's when the blonde man came back and congratulated us for solving the first puzzle.  Well he congratulated me and the woman. The others were just confused.  The man told us the attack was fake. It was just their way of making us scared.  They were testing us to see how we would deal under pressure and fear.  Then he said he was leaving again. He went out the door and locked it and wished us good luck in solving the next test. That's when I looked around the room again and noticed it had changed. the two rooms at the far back were now in a different location. A voice on the radio told us that this time around the threat was real and if we didn't solve the test some of us would be killed and the rest would stay there forever.

Once again I decided to look for some kind of clues. I went into the pastry room...nothing. Then I went into the small lobby. There was a safe there with a large dial on it. It was high up on a red painted wall. It was the only red wall in the whole place. I stepped on a sofa to reach the safe.  But I didn't know how to open it.  Once more the woman that helped me tried to help me again.  And again we found the answer.  We found the combination for the safe.  But how? I don't remember.  It was as if it wasn't in the dream. Suddenly a voice on the radio said we only had 5 minutes left to solve the test.  One of the other people sitting down ran over to me and grabbed it and took it to the safe. everyone else ran to the safe too. The woman and I stayed outside the room watching them go crazy trying to open this safe. this tiny room had small windows that allowed us to see inside. they were fighting just to open it.

The voice on the radio said we had just a few seconds left.   then the people got the safe open. inside they found a note. I didn't read it. I was nowhere near the note. But they all read it and looked scared. The door to the room shut and locked up. Then the people rushed to it to try and get out. the door wouldn't open.  After a while the people all fell to the floor. WTH?  The blonde man came back in and congratulated us again.  According to him, we had solved the test and that we had figured out that the answer was to kill the other people.  I didn't understand what this guy was saying. It made no sense. I mean it's a dream right.  But he told us that we could leave. That was enough to let him know what he needed.  Then he told us they do these tests to everyone.  he then said that the people that died didn't really die.  that they would just come back and fail again and again.  he then threatened our lives if we didn't get out of the building that very moment.  So the woman and I left.  When I got outside again, there was no sign of the woman anywhere. She was gone. I was left alone and I had no idea where to go.  I saw what looked like an entrance and beyond that I could see what looked like a flea market.  it ws kind of dark in there. 

I think I started to head towards the direction of the mall. But I could still see the huge tower up above.  There were also dark clouds in the distance and what looked like what every one calls the tsunami.  But I recently saw a nature show about weather and maybe it's not a tsunami but something called a roll cloud.

In our article, we explore the rich and eventful history of the New York Cafe from its beginnings to the present day. We present the birth of the palace, the vibrant literary life of the Golden Age, the decades of decline and rebirth, and we learn about the legends that have forever inscribed the place into the public consciousness of Budapest. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and authentic picture of this historically significant institution, which still proudly holds the title of ""The Most Beautiful Café in the World."" Prepare for a journey through time, where marble, bronze, and glittering lights transport you to a lost but eternally living world.

# The Birth of the Palace and the [New York Café](https://capitalshooting.eu/history-of-new-york-cafe-legends-and-the-spirit/) (1894)

The construction of the New York Palace, home to the New York Cafe, began at the initiative of the Hungarian representation of the American-based **New York Life Insurance Company**, after the company decided to build a worthy, representative headquarters in Budapest. The design competition was initiated by **Dr. Miksa Arányi**, the company's general manager in Hungary, who had previously met the insurance company's director in Paris.

# The Architect and the Style: The Masterpiece of [Alajos Hauszmann](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauszmann_Alajos)

The tender for the construction was won by one of the most recognized architects of the era, Alajos Hauszmann, in collaboration with Flóris Korb and Kálmán Giergl. The four-story, historicist-style palace opened its gates on October 23, 1894, at Erzsébet körút 9–11, as one of the most imposing buildings on the Grand Boulevard. Italian Renaissance elements dominated the design, and renowned sculptors and painters, such as Károly Senyei, Miklós Köllő, and Gusztáv Mannheimer and Ferenc Eisenhut, worked on the exterior and interior decoration. The palace originally included insurance company offices, rental apartments, and commercial premises on the ground floor.

# Point of Interest: The 14 Bronze Devils

# Did you know...?

The facade of the New York Cafe building, above the entrance, is decorated with 14 bronze satyr figures (commonly known as **""devils""**) symbolizing **El Asmodai**, the ancient figure of coffee and contemplation, holding lanterns in their hands. These figures, the eternal guardians of thoughts and inspiration, immediately caught the eye of the bohemian Pesti writers and contributed to the mystical, intellectual aura of the café.

# The Golden Age of the New York Café: The Workshop of Hungarian Literature

The New York Café itself opened two days after the palace's inauguration, on October 25, 1894. The luxurious interior, the marble, the bronze, and the glittering crystal chandeliers immediately captivated visitors. The establishment soon outgrew the role of a simple ground-floor room in the insurance company headquarters and became the literary and artistic center of Budapest at the turn of the century. At that time, cafés were not only meeting places but intellectual workshops where modern ideas, literary magazines, and political newspapers, discovered in Western Europe, were born.

# The Nyugat Generation and the Regular Tables

The **New York Cafe** became the regular haunt of the writers, poets, and editors of the Nyugat literary magazine. The works of Endre Ady, Mihály Babits, Dezső Kosztolányi, Frigyes Karinthy, and many others were created on the gallery, which today operates as the **White Salon**. The waiters in the café knew exactly which table was the ""workplace"" of a particular writer, and often served the daily black coffee, ink, and writing paper without a word.

# Fun Fact: Ferenc Molnár and Café Work

The world-famous story The Paul Street Boys (A Pál utcai fiúk) was also born from the pen of Ferenc Molnár on the legendary gallery. The New York Café provided not only inspiration but also a kind of ""office"" for the creators, which often replaced the living quarters and overnight accommodation for poorer writers of the era.

# The 'Little Literary' and the 'Dog's Tongue'

The management of the café showed special care in supporting the artists. This high level of expertise and commitment to culture is best demonstrated by the special services:

* **The 'Little Literary' (or 'Writers' Platter'):** Since most writers and poets lived in cramped financial circumstances, they could not afford to order food. In response to this problem, the café management created the famous 'Little Literary' platter, which was cheap—often free—and contained ham, salami, and cheese, thereby helping the creators to survive.
* **The 'Dog's Tongue':** This phrase referred to the A/4-sized paper sheet, folded lengthwise and cut in half, which was provided free of charge to writers alongside their tray, together with ink. However, according to the narrative of Gyula Krúdy, the use of the dog's tongue was eventually banned because Frigyes Karinthy allegedly poured ink over the sofa.

# Following the Legends: Ferenc Molnár and the Key

The history of the New York Café abounds with legends based on real events, yet interwoven with Pesti humor and poetic exaggeration. The most famous and frequently mentioned of these is the throwing of the café's key into the Danube, which is closely related to the main keyword, the New York Cafe.

# Literary Legend vs. Reality

The legend says that on the night after the café's opening on October 23, 1894, Ferenc Molnár and the other bohemian writers of the time (such as Jenő Heltai) stole the key to the entrance door and threw it into the Danube with the aim that the café should never close and remain open day and night for art and creation.

**According to the facts:** Although the story sounds good, Ferenc Molnár was only a 16-year-old high school student at the time, so he was unlikely to have been leading the event. It is more probable that the basis of the legend is an earlier event, perhaps a similar incident that occurred at the Fiume Café, or the assumption that the key ended up in the Danube during the café's reconstruction in 1927, when Ferenc Molnár was already a recognized writer. However, the spirit of the café lives on today: in 2014, the management itself symbolically threw the key into the Danube, ""so that if not permanently, it should remain open for at least another 120 years.""

# Decline and Rebirth: The Era of the Hungária Café

After the First World War, the café remained popular, but the economic crisis and the deterioration of the political situation broke the old splendor. Following the damage caused by the Second World War, the café closed, and the building came under state ownership. The palace served as the office building for the Lapkiadó Vállalat (Newspaper Publishing Company) and housed numerous editorial offices.

The complete decline came in the 1950s when part of the premises was converted into a sporting goods store, losing all its grandeur. Although it reopened as a café in 1954, it was under the name Hungária Café, and it remained only a faint memory of its former self. This period marks the decrease in the cultural role of cafés during the nationalized era, but the social function of the place, albeit weakened, continued to live on.

The turning point occurred in 2006 when the **Boscolo Group** began a comprehensive renovation. Thanks to the Italian investment, the New York Cafe regained its original, stunning splendor. The ornate stucco work, gilded columns, frescoes, and marble shone in their former glory. Since 2020, the building has operated as the [**Anantara New York Palace Budapest Hotel**](https://www.minorhotels.com/en/destinations/hungary/budapest/anantara-new-york-palace-budapest-hotel), but the café has retained its historical name and function.

# The Most Beautiful Café in the World Today: The New York Cafe Experience

# Precision in the Rifle and the Pen

# Master of Focus: Like the Writer, Like the Shooter

Although the Golden Age of the New York Cafe belonged to the wielders of the pen, it also applies to modern Budapest experiences. The two locations – the café and the Capital Shooting range – show common traits in the demand for precision, providing a neat link between the two experiences:

# ""Ink to Target"" Experience

**Did you know?** 20th-century Hungarian writers received the specially cut paper sheet called ""dog's tongue"" at the New York Café to record their thoughts as precisely and space-efficiently as possible. This demand for precision was not limited to using a pen.

When you leave the New York and arrive at the Capital Shooting range, the need for concentration remains, only the medium changes. Using a rifle requires the highest level of mental focus, similar to how a writer tuned out the café noise to create their work.

1pghu34,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeltoiWellness/comments/1pghu34/why_hydration_matters_more_when_appetite_drops_on/,Why Hydration Matters More When Appetite Drops on GLP-1 Medication,"One of the first things people in Northern Ireland notice when they start Wegovy, Ozempic or Mounjaro is:

* “I’m not hungry.”
* “I forgot to eat.”
* “I had three bites and was stuffed.”
* “Food just isn’t appealing anymore.”



It’s brilliant for weight loss, but it has a side effect most people *don’t* expect:  
**Your hydration levels drop.**

And staying hydrated becomes a way bigger deal than you’d think.



# 1. GLP-1s slow your digestion, so you drink less without realising

These meds slow gastric emptying.  
That means food and fluid stay in your stomach longer.

The side effect?  
You feel full faster… *even if it’s just liquid.*

A glass of water can feel like a meal.  
So you drink less throughout the day without meaning to.

Less drinking → mild dehydration → worse side effects.



# 2. Reduced appetite = reduced cues to drink

In normal life, eating triggers thirst.

* You drink with meals
* You sip while cooking
* You take a drink after salty foods
* Tea/coffee breaks revolve around snacks

When GLP-1s remove hunger, they also remove the *habit loops* that tell you to drink.

People regularly go:

“I only realised at 6pm that I’d had one coffee all day.”

That’s dehydration creeping in quietly.



# 3. Dehydration makes GLP-1 side effects 10 times worse

Here’s what dehydration amplifies:

# Nausea

Your stomach is already moving slowly.  
Add dehydration and it’s a recipe for feeling queasy.

# Headaches

90 percent of GLP-1 headaches come from simply not drinking enough.

# Fatigue + dizziness

Low hydration = low blood pressure + low energy.

# Constipation

A big one. Water keeps things moving.  
Without it, GLP-1 patients can get seriously backed up.

# Heartburn

A dry digestive system gets irritated easily.

# Muscle cramps

Especially in the legs at night.

All of these feel like “medication side effects,”  
but they’re usually just **dehydration in disguise**.



# 4. Habits in NI make this worse



NI hydration habits are… let’s say “modest”:

* tea instead of water
* coffee instead of water
* energy drinks instead of water
* fizzy drinks instead of water
* “I’ll be grand” instead of water

GLP-1s don’t fix this, they make it worse because you’re not eating much.

If your diet suddenly shrinks but your water intake doesn’t rise, you’ll feel it.



# 5. Less food = fewer electrolytes

Food supplies:

* sodium
* potassium
* magnesium
* hydration via fruit/veg
* moisture from meals
* salt-triggered thirst

When you’re eating half a sandwich a day, you lose those built-in hydration cues.

So hydration becomes something you need to **actively**, not accidentally, maintain.



# 6. Signs you’re dehydrated on GLP-1s

Patients commonly report:

* headaches
* dizziness when standing
* nausea that feels random
* dry mouth
* constipation
* darker urine
* weak feeling
* “tight” stomach
* craving salty foods
* more side effects after an injection

If those show up, 9 times out of 10 the solution isn’t changing dose, it’s upping water.



# 7. The hydration rule for GLP-1 users (easy version)

You don’t need to chug gallons.  
Just aim for:

# 1.5 to 2 litres a day, in small sips.

Big gulps can feel awful because your stomach is slower.

Think:

* a glass every couple hours
* a water bottle beside you
* small sips instead of huge drinks

Soft, steady hydration > chugging like you’re doing the Belfast marathon.



# 8. Ideas that work well for NI patients

# Electrolyte tablets

Cheap ones from B&M / Lidl / Home Bargains are grand.  
Use them once a day if you’re feeling dizzy or tired.

# Herbal teas / decaf teas

Still count as hydration.

# Protein water or protein milk

Ideal if your appetite is tiny.

# Ice cubes or diluted juice

Easier on the stomach than plain water for some people.

# Soups

Hydration disguised as food. Perfect on GLP-1s.



# 9. The Keltoi approach why we keep banging on about hydration

When patients in NI start GLP-1s, the two things that derail them are:

* **dehydration**
* **not enough protein**

Hydration fixes:

* nausea
* headaches
* dizziness
* constipation
* fatigue
* injection-day side effects
* appetite crashes

Keltoi patients who nail hydration have a *much smoother* experience.

If anyone wants guidance during treatment, Keltoi helps with:

* weekly support
* hydration routines
* managing side effects
* dose progression
* metabolic monitoring
* medication posting if needed

1pghtz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CheatedOn/comments/1pghtz4/i_wasted_3_years_of_my_life_with_a_pathological/,I wasted 3 years of my life with a pathological liar 🫠,"We met during the pandemic and after a couple of months we started some kind of a situationship. Two years in, I asked him if he wants to be my boyfriend, to which he reacted with ""do you want me to be your boyfriend?"" and also what would change. Monogamy, more time together, accountability - that's what I wanted. He said ok.

So from then on, we were ""together"" for a year. Nothing changed, he still treated me the same way, we didn't spend more time together. I communicated my needs, he listened to them and that was it.

At some point, I imagined him proposing to me and realized right after that this is never going to happen. I broke up. He told me ""I figured you'd break up, you've been so distant the last weeks"". I was startled as to why he wouldn't have talked to me about it when he noticed something is off. Didn't get a plausible explanation.

That's the thing - I never got any plausible explanations. I never doubted him either. I'm a goddamn catch, why would he do anything that could put out relationship at hazard? 🤡 

We agreed to remain friends and a month and a half after the break up, he asked me if I could go cat sitting while he is gone for couple days and I agreed.

Went to his house, fed the cat, made myself comfortable, as I was invited to. Walking by his neatly folded laundry, I saw a lacy thong on top of it. Huh. Then I went and opened the drawer that used to be mine - it was full of lacy thongs and bras. Mind you, in the year we were together, I didn't keep more than 1-2 pairs of socks and panties in there.

I felt so stupid. Standing there in his apartment, taking care of his cat. I bet he never asked lacy thong lady for a favour.

I talked to a mutual friend about it and while we were sharing stories about him, we both noticed that he seems to sprinkle a lie in almost every sentence. He'd tell her he's getting evicted from his home soon - I've heard that several times in the 3 years I spent with him. Never got suspicious when he would drive to see his mom in hospice at 9pm. He hated her and she was 2 hours away. Also what kind of hospital let's you visit at this time of day? 

That's when it started to hurt really bad - how could I fall for somebody who seems to have built a whole new persona, telling people things that are going to make them compassionate about this man that is plagued by problems everywhere? How could I trust anyone so blindly and never second guess and brush off any nonsensical story they tell me? And trust me, there were plenty of them. He also has a probably fake chronical illness, that he would use as an excuse to cancel plans last minute.

That underwear has probably always been there, he just hid it better while we were still together. Some friends jokingly said that maybe he likes to wear lacy underwear - it was not his size. 

Ever since I realized how he has played me, I've ignored him anytime we're in the same room. I feel sorry for this worm of a man that is so empty, he has to fake a personality.

Bonus-Story: The Puzzle

For every birthday and Christmas, I would get him a small gift. I didn't get anything, so I stopped buying gifts for him. Then all of sudden, shortly before Christmas he says ""your gift is not going to get her for Christmas, I'm sorry"". Oh shit, now I have to buy a present too! I did. It came on time. 

Around February, I asked where my present is and he sent me a screenshot of the purchase, revealing what it is. A small puzzle. 

Now let me tell you, I know who I am and if any of you spent just 5 minutes talking to me, you'd have a better gift idea than a puzzle. Puzzles were never my interest and it seemed to me like the most generic gift ever made. 

At some point, the puzzle came. Hooray.

Shortly after we broke up, we went for a coffee. He said, he got a small birthday gift for me. I didn't expect that. Then he gives me a puzzle. The same puzzle I got for Christmas.
I laughed and said ""a second one?"". He was embarrassed and just put it back in his pocket.

Let’s parse the odds, invent some absurd team quirks, and crown a winner before the halftime break.

### Parse the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?

The numbers are as clear as a Barcelona fan’s disdain for Madrid: **Espanyol is the slight favorite**, with odds hovering around **2.4 (decimal)**, implying a **41.7% chance of victory**. Rayo Vallecano, at **3.2**, suggests a **31.3% chance**, while the draw sits at **3.1** (32.3%). For context, Espanyol’s implied edge is about the same as your chances of finding a functioning urinal at a soccer stadium. Close, but not *great*.

The spread? Espanyol is favored by **0.25 goals**, meaning they’re expected to win by a margin larger than a single coffee order at a Madrid café. The total goals line is **2.25**, with “Under” priced lower than “Over,” hinting at a match where both teams will spend 89 minutes debating whether to shoot on goal.

As we were leaving an extra large woman is coming towards us. My wife was ahead of me leaving as I was putting my jacket on. 

As she comes towards the large lady she brushed off her sleeve, offers an apology and walks on. Large seems to have taken some sort of offence and said, “stupid cunt” under her breath while standing looking at the table I’m leaving so she can have it. 

I look this unpleasant person straight in the eye and asked her why? She seemed a little confused so I just continued to stare at her, took off my jacket and sat back down.

1pghqqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/RestlessLegs/comments/1pghqqj/iron_absorption/,Iron Absorption,"Everybody says Iron is important here, so I have been taking iron. The problem is, my stool was significant darker after taking iron, which made me suspicious that it wasn’t actually getting absorbed.

I had a free trial of Google Gemini, and while I’m not a big user of AI yet, I thought I’d pose the question and see what it said. I told it I was weening off of Mirapex and wanted to increase my iron absorption. I’ll paste the reply. The TLDR: I’ve been taking iron with vitamin C and lactoferrin IN THE MORNINGS a my stool is back to the normal color.

Here is the Gemini reply:

This is a great specific question. Because your goal is to get off medication, efficiency matters—you want to raise your iron stores (Ferritin) as quickly and effectively as possible so your brain has the dopamine support it needs to handle the drug taper. Here is the breakdown of how to optimize your iron intake for RLS.

1.	⁠Lactoferrin vs. Vitamin C: Which is better? You don't have to choose one; they do different things. However, if you are strictly looking for absorption, Vitamin C is the standard ""booster."" If you are looking for tolerability, Lactoferrin is the ""protector.""

•	⁠Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid):
	⁠•	⁠Role: It increases acidity in your stomach, which chemically converts iron into a form your body can actually absorb.
	⁠•	⁠Verdict: Essential. You should always take iron with Vitamin C (or a glass of orange juice).
•	⁠Lactoferrin (A protein found in milk):
	⁠•	⁠Role: It binds to iron and helps transport it, but its main superpower is reducing the side effects of iron (like constipation and nausea) and lowering inflammation.
	⁠•	⁠Verdict: Optional but excellent. If iron hurts your stomach, adding Lactoferrin can make it bearable. Some studies suggest taking Lactoferrin alongside your iron supplement can improve your blood numbers faster than iron alone.

1.	⁠Timing: Morning vs. Night? For the specific goal of raising Ferritin to get off Mirapex, Morning is significantly better.

•	⁠The Science (Hepcidin): Your liver produces a hormone called hepcidin that blocks iron absorption. Hepcidin levels follow a circadian rhythm—they are lowest in the morning and rise throughout the day.
•	⁠The Trap: Many RLS patients take iron at night because that's when their legs hurt. This is a mistake. By evening, your hepcidin levels are high, blocking absorption. You might only absorb a fraction of the dose compared to the morning.
•	⁠Best Protocol: Take your iron first thing in the morning on an empty stomach (1 hour before coffee or food). Coffee and tea contain tannins that block iron absorption. Summary Protocol for Maximum Efficiency To support your transition off Mirapex, here is the ""Gold Standard"" oral iron routine:
•	⁠Time: First thing in the morning (empty stomach).
•	⁠The Combo:
	⁠•	⁠Iron: (Ideally ""Ferrous Bisglycinate"" or ""Chelated Iron""—these are gentler than Sulfate).
	⁠•	⁠Vitamin C: 250mg - 500mg (to boost absorption).
	⁠•	⁠(Optional) Lactoferrin: Add this if the iron upsets your stomach.
•	⁠The Wait: Wait at least 60 minutes before having your morning coffee, tea, or breakfast (especially eggs or dairy). Next Step When you request the Ferritin test from your doctor, ask them if you can take a copy of the results home. RLS specialists look for a number above 75 ng/mL, whereas many general labs mark anything above 30 ng/mL as ""Normal."" You need to see the specific number to know if your taper will be safe.",3,1765112236.0,RestlessLegs,2,1.0,False

**Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You’ll Actually Enjoy**  
Let’s crunch some numbers like a defender crumbles a crisp pastry. The odds paint a clear picture: **Valencia is the favorite**, with implied probabilities hovering around **66-68%** (thanks to -200/-250 odds across bookmakers). Sevilla? They’re the soccer version of a last-minute Netflix password sharer—priced at +350 to +380, translating to a **22-25% chance**. The draw? A 29-30% shot, which is about the same chance your local barista has of remembering your coffee order.

The spread bets (Valencia -0.5) suggest bookmakers think Valencia’s home form is just good enough to avoid a “Sevilla Escape With a Moral Lesson” narrative. Meanwhile, the Under 2.5 goals line is favored (-115 to -120), implying this might be a tactical duel between a team (Valencia) needing points and a team (Sevilla)… well, not.

Valencia arrives at Mestalla with a **1-1 draw vs. Rayo Vallecano** and a **Copa del Rey win over Extremadura**, which is about as thrilling as a spreadsheet audit but earns them points. Their probable starters? Alexis Sánchez, the veteran who’s seen better days (think of him as a Michelin-starred chef using expired ingredients), and Chidera Ejuke, whose speed could make Sevilla’s defenders feel like they’re sprinting through a honeycomb.

Anyway, ten years later, you're back for Christmas. It's the first time since forever. Literally the first person you see is that guy in a coffee shop. But 30..…and well, 20kg heavier, with muscles on his muscles. Think Terry from Brooklyn 99 muscles. And I'm not working in the Starbucks, I own the business opposite. 

As well as the successful business, the incredible body, fluent in four languages, I'm newly single. 

You barely recognise me when I sends over a coffee. for you. The chat is respectful and fluent. Like you've never left. And you need to see me again. 

Thanksgiving is terrible. Your sister in law is horrible and they have announced their second pregnancy. For the twentieth time she asked when you'll settle down. Then one of the close family members announced that she's got a medical problem. It's all too much. Your phone buzzes.

'So....how's your Christmas? I have to say I'm thankful for having just got these people out of my house. I'm just cleaning up. Do you want to pop round? We never properly caught up. And you looked amazing.'

An hour later, we were in my huge, warm house, laughing about nothing in particular. 

Two hours later, holding hands, discussing our lives to date.

Exactly a year later, it's Christmas again. I smile and look other to my wife and place my hands on your growing tummy. 'Alexis. It's been quite a year....Shall we reminisce?'

1pghmjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1pghmjm/220_days_i_longlasting_symptoms_tips_for/,"220 days i, long-lasting symptoms, tips for management","Hi, I was a Snus and later Velo pouches user for many years. Quit over half a year ago. I don't want write much about symptoms I experienced to not repeat what many of you wrote. It was similar. Anxiety with a peak in 4th month (!), ER visit thinking something wrong with my heart. Anxiety attacks when driving a car. Head pressure, racing thoughts, trouble sleeping, low energy, constant stress, trouble focusing on my tasks. All that coming in waves with some good days in between. Very slowly improving.

What helped me:  
\- this subreddit, really when I got first anxiety attacks it helped me understand it's from nicotine  
\- contact with a doctor - performing all health checks, blood works etc.  
\- reducing stress, having tons of rest (stress could trigger symptoms for days)  
\- reducing caffeine to 1 coffee a day, later went back to 2 cups  
\- 0 alcohol  
\- glycine/collagen supplementation  
\- wearing a CGM (continuous glucose monitor) to learn erratic glucose levels that were triggering symptoms  
\- lot's of movement, also some higher intensity workout

Glycine

Let me elaborate about glycine as this looks like a game changer for me.  
For many months I was taking 100-200mg of magnesium diglycinate that was helping me with sleep. It was giving me some relief.  
But about a week ago I tried 5g of glycine (split into 3 doses during the day), after reading that our diet can be deficient in this amino acid.  
I instantly noticed much more energy, better sleep overall, much better feeling. Then I decided to switch to 20g of collagen which is a glycine-rich protein. (20g of collagen is roughly 6.5g of glycine). My thinking is, that for an active person whole collagen protein will be better than only glycine.  
Before that I was struggling to do 10k steps a day which before quitting was nothing. After starting supplementation I notice I'm doing 12k without feeling overly tired. I'm slowly getting back to my regular exercise routine. Still lot of work to do...

CGM

This device showed me that I was having both high peaks over 180mg/dl after some meals as well as crashes below 60mg/dl.  
During crashes I was experiencing increased heart rate during my walks, chest discomfort/aches. This was apparently triggering a lot of anxiety.  
I'm learning to  
\- avoid meals that spike my glucose  
\- provide enough calories to avoid crashes  
\- working on proper electrolytes intake and hydration

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Aalesund vs. Bryne FK: A Clash of Toaster Reliability and Coffee-Induced Nerves**

Let’s parse the chaos that is Norwegian football odds, where Bryne FK (-205) rolls into this Eliteserien clash as the statistical favorite, while Aalesund (+320) plays the role of the overconfident barista who thinks espresso shots will fix *everything*. The implied probabilities? Bryne has a 48.8% shot to win, Aalesund 31.3%, and a 20% chance this ends in a draw—about as likely as a Norwegian winter without snow.

**The Math: Why Bryne’s Odds Are as Reliable as a Norwegian Geothermal Heat Pump**  
Bryne’s -0.25 spread suggests they’re the team to back, but only if you’re into games decided by penalty kicks or a single deflection off a water bottle. The total goals line sits at 2.5, with “Over” priced slightly lower (1.8–1.85) than “Under” (1.85–1.98). In other words, expect a match as explosive as a lukewarm cappuccino foam—present, but not enough to keep you awake.

**The News: Lillestrøm’s Cup Domination, Aalesund’s… Existence?**  
While Lillestrøm’s recent Norwegian Cup triumph (3-1 over Sarpsborg) makes headlines, Aalesund and Bryne FK are busy being… well, themselves. No major injuries or transfers are mentioned here, so we’ll assume Aalesund’s star striker isn’t “recovering from a hamstring injury after tripping over their own shoelaces” (yet). Bryne, meanwhile, has the form of a man who’s mastered the art of “show, don’t

this movie honestly feels like someone took a genuinely promising idea, dumped it on the floor, stepped on it twice, and then proudly served it to the audience as if it were gourmet cinema. inspired by real operations or not, ଏହିପରି half baked storytelling re patriotism bhi thakijae. the film tries to sound intelligent, but most scenes feel like they were written during a coffee shop argument.

the pacing is a complete disaster. one moment you are in the middle of tense negotiations, the next moment the editor has jumped to a random lane in karachi like he lost the remote. ସତକଥା re mu confusion re sitting re rehi jauthili. it does not build tension, it builds migraines.

the cast includes  and many more talented people who deserve better material than this. most supporting actors are delivering lines like they are auditioning for a school play. but akshaye khanna is the only one who walks in with genuine presence. ମୋଗୋ that man speaks two sentences and suddenly the film feels alive for five seconds. akshaye khanna could read a grocery list and still make it sound like high command intelligence briefing.

sadly, even he cannot save the clumsy writing.

the villains are painfully unconvincing. they scream, they pose, they shoot, but none of them feel dangerous. more like confused uncles who wandered into the set. ଏମିତି dakait dekhile todler bhi hansi debi.

the emotional scenes feel so flat that even background music gives up. there is no emotional core. no depth. just dramatic lighting and people breathing heavily to appear intense. you can almost feel the director whispering action like he is begging the actors to look serious.

the action is worse. the camerawork shakes so much ଲାଗୁଥିଲା cameraman ku dhakka lagila. every fight looks like it was shot by a man who forgot to hold the camera properly. zoom in zoom out blur blur, by the end you are praying for stability the way students pray during exam results.

political messaging is so forced, so obvious, so painfully loud, that subtlety died somewhere in the first fifteen minutes. subtlety ku ଗୋଲି ମାରିଦେଲେ literally. the film wants to show geopolitics but ends up showing google search level knowledge.

and the worst part is that it keeps pretending it is deep and layered when it barely scratches the surface. it wants to be ten things at once gritty, emotional, intellectual, patriotic, stylish, raw, intense, philosophical, dramatic, and historically important. in the end it becomes none of these. it becomes noise.

the supporting arcs feel unfinished, the dialogues feel either too heavy or completely empty, and the world building is thinner than hotel tea. the more you watch, the more you feel like the movie is constantly overestimating its own importance. ଏହିପରି overconfidence re even audience patience bhi parhae jae.

basically, the entire experience feels like a big budget youtube short stretched into a feature film.


and yes, this is my personal opinion before anyone starts fighting. if you loved the film, good for you. but many of the glowing reviews online honestly feel like PR disguised as praise, not genuine reactions from people who sat through this chaos.",0,1765111625.0,Odisha,3,0.44,False

I suffer from CPTSD, abuse (CSA), neglect, then anorexia for 15 years, self-harm, then bipolar disorder always on the depressive side, severe body dysmorphia, then story after story with pathological narcissists, a rape… now I’ve been shut inside my house for 6 years with only medications, going out three times a year, and during one of those outings I caught Covid, it developed into long Covid and now POTS. That is, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, meaning that if I get out of bed my heart shoots up to a thousand and blood doesn’t reach my brain.

My life is now reduced to this: waking up in the morning, drinking coffee, taking about ten medications, having to go back to bed hoping that night comes soon. At night I only have nightmares, always only nightmares. But what’s the point of living like this?

In the spring I had managed to start taking public transport and going for short walks — not much, but a small step. And now I find myself with a physical condition that makes me depend even more on others, including my abusive family. I can’t do this anymore.

Friends? Not even when I was in the ER did anyone bother to call me or tell me they were sorry, except for a guy who, as I eventually realized — fortunately this time in time — was a narcissist. In the days after, I used the grey rock method with a simple boring, neutral reply, and he disappeared. Good.

The fact is that I’ve been left alone, ever since I collapsed years ago. Before, I had a life, people wanted to be around me; then I got sick, and one by one they all vanished. I had a long-distance best friend for 20 years. We laughed a lot, we confided in each other about everything, he wasn’t doing well but together we were a team and we managed to use dark humor even about our tragedies. He got a partner, and he completely disappeared. After twenty years of talking every day. Was I only useful as long as he was unwell and lonely? He, who was my ultimate point of reference?

Imagine the other so-called friends, who all slowly showed themselves to be selfish or narcissistic (and I’m not playing the victim: I had chosen them myself, due to repetition compulsion).

# THE VOICE THAT CHANGED BRITISH MUSIC

If you were a teenager in Britain in 1958, you remember exactly where you were when you first heard **""Move It.""**

The song came on the radio, or maybe you heard it from a friend's record player, or maybe from a shop window on a Saturday afternoon, and it stopped you cold.

The voice was **raw**. Not polished like the crooners your parents listened to. Not safe like the singers on BBC radio. This voice had an **edge**; it had **danger**. It had something that made teenage girls scream and teenage boys want to form bands.

The voice belonged to **Cliff Richard**, and ""Move It"" was the first authentic British rock and roll record. Not an imitation of American rock, not a watered-down version for British audiences. The real thing.

[Cliff Richard at the Granada, February 1959](https://preview.redd.it/y0y98tb3vr5g1.jpg?width=2965&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61ec7aabb28a370893cd4a0df60262f37175144e)

**Within months, Cliff Richard was Britain's answer to Elvis Presley.** Within years, he would become one of the most successful British musicians of all time, with more UK number-one singles than any other male artist, more UK top-ten hits than Elvis himself in Britain, and a career spanning seven decades.

But here's what most people don't know.

**Cliff Richard wasn't born in Britain. He was born in India.**

Not just born there, he spent the first eight years of his life in India. In Lucknow. In Dehra Dun. In Howrah, **across the river from Calcutta.**

He grew up in the world of the **Anglo-Indians**, a community that doesn't really exist anymore, a community that was neither fully British nor fully Indian, a community that lived in a strange in-between space during the last gasping years of the British Raj.

And when that world collapsed, when India became independent, when communal violence tore through Calcutta's streets, when the Anglo-Indians realized they had no place in the new India, his family fled to Britain.

The boy who arrived in England in 1948 was **traumatized**, displaced. Bullied for his dark skin and strange accent. An outsider who didn't quite fit anywhere.

And that trauma, that displacement, that sense of not-belonging, **that's what created the voice that would define British rock and roll.**

*This is the story of those eight years. The story of a vanished world. The story of how Calcutta, in its own strange way, helped create British rock music.*

# THE STORY, A CHILD OF THE RAJ'S LAST DAYS

**OCTOBER 1940: BIRTH IN A CITY OF EXILES**

On October 14, 1940, a woman named Dorothy Webb gave birth to a boy at King George's Hospital on Victoria Street in Lucknow.

She named him **Harry Rodger Webb**.

The choice of Lucknow for the birth wasn't random. Dorothy and her husband Rodger lived in Dehra Dun at the time, but Dorothy travelled to Lucknow specifically because, as she later said, Lucknow had a *""reputable hospital, very British as well.""*

This detail tells you everything about the world Harry was born into.

**The Anglo-Indians didn't trust Indian hospitals.** They wanted British doctors, British nurses, British standards of hygiene and care. Even for something as universal as childbirth, they maintained the separation between ""us"" and ""them.""

(Ironically, Indian doctors make up a very significant portion of the UK's medical workforce today. One estimate suggested that as many as **one in ten** doctors practicing in the UK were from India. Another report noted that the largest non-White-British ethnicity group among doctors was **Indian**, making up **19% of consultants** (the most senior grade of hospital doctor) and **23% of other specialist doctors** in 2024.) [Source 1](https://ehealth.eletsonline.com/2013/11/1-in-10-doctors-practicing-in-uk-is-from-india/#:~:text=This%20means%201%20in%20every,quarter%20were%20trained%20outside%20Europe.)

Dorothy stayed with Rodger's father, Frederick Webb, who lived in Maqbara colony near Hazratganj, one of Lucknow's Anglo-Indian neighbourhoods. After the birth, the baby was baptized at St Thomas Church on Rajpur Road in Dehra Dun.

The baptism mattered. Christianity was one of the key markers that separated Anglo-Indians from the Hindu and Muslim majority. You could be brown-skinned, born in India, speak Hindi as well as English, but if you were Christian, you were Anglo-Indian, not Indian.

# WHO WERE THE ANGLO-INDIANS?

Before we go further, you need to understand what **""Anglo-Indian""** means, because this community barely exists anymore, and most people have never heard of it.

**Anglo-Indians were people of mixed British and Indian ancestry who lived in India during British rule.**

Some had British fathers and Indian mothers. Some had one British grandparent. Some had mixed ancestry going back several generations, making them neither fully British nor fully Indian.

But here's the crucial thing: **Anglo-Indians identified as British, not Indian.** They spoke English at home. They went to Christian churches. They celebrated Christmas and Easter, not Diwali or Eid. They dressed in European clothes. They tried to maintain British cultural practices even though they lived in India.

The British colonial system encouraged this. The Anglo-Indians were useful; they filled positions in the railways, post offices, telegraph services, and customs offices. Jobs that required some technical skill, but that the British didn't want to give to Indians, and couldn't fill with enough actual British people.

[Anglo Indian community at Rangers Club, Calcutta](https://preview.redd.it/b1dipld9yr5g1.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6f7b44ef2cdfcac3345b5cbd6d72268d7e19792)

So Anglo-Indians became a **buffer class**, above Indians in the colonial hierarchy, **but below actual British people.** Not quite colonisers, but not colonised either. Somewhere in between.

They lived in their own neighbourhoods. They had their own schools, their own social clubs, their own churches. In cities like Calcutta, Lucknow, Bombay, and Madras, there were entire enclaves where Anglo-Indian families lived together, maintaining their distinct identity.

By 1940, when Harry Webb was born, there were about **300,000 Anglo-Indians in India**, a tiny minority in a country of 400 million, but a visible and economically important one.

# THE WEBB FAMILY, ENGINEERS OF EMPIRE

Harry's family was typical Anglo-Indian working class.

His great-grandfather, **Thomas Benjamin Webb**, had come to India in the 1870s to work as an engineer for the Indian Railways. The railways were one of the great projects of British India, tens of thousands of miles of track connecting the entire subcontinent, making it possible to extract resources and move troops efficiently.

*Young Englishmen like Thomas Webb were recruited for this work. They were offered salaries far better than they could get in Britain.* They came to India, worked for the railways or other colonial enterprises, married (sometimes British women who'd come to India to find husbands, sometimes Anglo-Indian women, occasionally Indian women, though this was officially discouraged), and raised families.

Thomas's son **Frederick Webb** followed the same path, working as an engineer, moving between different railway postings across India and Burma, eventually settling in Lucknow, where he worked at a paper mill.

Harry's father, **Rodger Oscar Webb**, was born in Rangoon (now Yangon, Myanmar) in 1904. He grew up in the world of railway colonies and Anglo-Indian society. He learned the skills needed for lower-middle-class Anglo-Indian life, good English, basic technical knowledge, how to manage accounts, and deal with both British superiors and Indian workers.

Rodger got a job managing railway station restaurants, the dining rooms at major train stations where British passengers and well-off Indians could eat during their journeys. It was skilled work requiring management ability, but it wasn't prestigious. It placed the family firmly in the Anglo-Indian working class.

# DOROTHY, A WOMAN ABANDONED

Harry's mother, **Dorothy Marie Dazely**, came from a more complicated background.

Her father had served in the British-Indian Army but had abandoned the family to start a new life in Karachi with another woman. This left Dorothy and her sister Olive to be raised by their mother alone, difficult in a society where respectability and family structure mattered enormously.

Dorothy was educated at a boarding school in Sanawar, near Simla (Shimla) in the hills. These boarding schools were crucial Anglo-Indian institutions; they took children from across India and educated them according to British standards, creating a shared cultural identity even though the children came from scattered railway colonies and urban enclaves.

Rodger met Dorothy at the railway institute in Asansol, West Bengal. These railway social clubs were where Anglo-Indians gathered for badminton, tennis, cards, and dances. They were the heart of Anglo-Indian social life, spaces where young people met, courted, and married within their community.

# DEHRA DUN: CHILDHOOD IN A HILL STATION

After Harry's birth, the Webb family lived in **Dehra Dun**, where Rodger managed the railway station restaurant.

Dehra Dun was a **cantonment town**, a military garrison and administrative centre, situated at the foothills of the Himalayas. It had been established by the British as a place to escape the brutal heat of the plains during summer. The town had a distinctly British character, tree-lined avenues, churches, clubs, and cricket pitches.

For young Harry, life in Dehra Dun was sheltered and privileged by Indian standards, though modest by British standards.

[Old British House, Dehradun](https://preview.redd.it/h96xv3svyr5g1.jpg?width=820&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c34003b79a1f79228e24e4cd76971d3319464872)

The family employed **six servants**, a cook, a bearer (head servant), a sweeper, a gardener, a childminder (ayah), and a washerwoman. This wasn't unusual for Anglo-Indian families; domestic labour was cheap, and employing servants was a way of maintaining visible status.

Harry's world was entirely English-speaking and Christian. He attended church every Sunday. He played with Anglo-Indian children. His contact with ""real"" India, the Hindu and Muslim majority, was limited to the servants who worked for the family.

The physical layout of Dehra Dun reinforced this separation. The cantonment area, where the British and Anglo-Indians lived, was physically separated from the Indian bazaar areas. You could live your entire life in the cantonment and barely interact with Indian society beyond giving orders to servants.

This was the world Harry knew for his first few years, a world that seemed stable, permanent, partly British. A world where your place was defined and secure.

***But that world was about to collapse*****.**

# 1943: HOWRAH, INTO THE INDUSTRIAL CITY

When Harry was about three, the family moved to **Howrah**, the industrial city across the Hooghly River from Calcutta.

Howrah was completely different from Dehra Dun. It was not a genteel hill station. It was a working-class industrial city, the site of Howrah Station (one of India's busiest railway terminals), jute mills, engineering works, and factories. The streets were crowded, noisy, chaotic.

The family took a house on **Dobson Road** (now renamed Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad Road) in the heart of Howrah's Anglo-Indian residential area. The street was congested with small shops, heavy traffic, and the general bustle of urban life.

But even in this industrial working-class environment, the Anglo-Indian community maintained its distinct identity. There were Anglo-Indian schools, churches, and social clubs. The community clustered together in specific neighbourhoods, creating islands of English-speaking Christian life in the overwhelming Hindu-Muslim Indian city surrounding them.

# ST THOMAS SCHOOL: EDUCATION IN AN ENGLISH WORLD

[St Thomas School](https://preview.redd.it/0ayc4i24zr5g1.jpg?width=820&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6d361544867f1fd84bb9e4682760ccb5d47d405)

In 1945, at age five, Harry was enrolled in **St Thomas School**, one of Howrah's Anglo-Indian educational institutions.

The school had been established in the 1860s by a British chaplain specifically for ""the education of Anglo-Indian children of Howrah."" By the 1940s, it was one of the institutions that defined Anglo-Indian life, a place where children learned to be proper British subjects even though they had never been to Britain.

The curriculum was entirely in English. The students read English literature, Shakespeare, Dickens, and English poetry. They learned British history, the kings and queens, the Empire's victories, and the glory of British civilization. They sang hymns in church services. They played cricket and football according to British rules.

Harry also learned **Hindi and ""a smattering of Bengali""**, enough to communicate with servants and shopkeepers. *But these languages were stigmatized within Anglo-Indian culture*. Speaking Hindi too well, or heaven forbid having an Indian accent when you spoke English, *marked you as lower class, as too ""native.""*

The ideal was to speak English with a British accent, to know just enough local language for practical purposes, and to maintain cultural practices that demonstrated your British identity.

# CHILDHOOD PLEASURES: TEAROOM AND CINEMA

Harry's childhood wasn't all school and church. There were pleasures, carefully curated pleasures that reinforced the family's cultural identity.

His aunt **Olive Dazely** (Dorothy's younger sister) played a significant role in his life, taking him on outings that young Harry loved.

They went to the **Indian Botanical Gardens at Shibpur**, across the river. These gardens, established by the British in 1787, were a carefully manicured space, nature organized according to scientific principles, orderly and civilized, unlike the ""wild"" Indian landscape.

They went to **Flury's**, the famous European-style tearoom on Park Street in Calcutta. Flury's had been established in 1927 by a Swiss couple and had become the gathering place for Calcutta's British and Anglo-European elite. The tearoom served European pastries, fine chocolates, and tea in an elegant setting designed to evoke old-world European refinement.

[Flury's, Calcutta](https://preview.redd.it/gmhe68aczr5g1.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=acc588acbd647508f1d9e0365d7ef9d55395dd86)

For young Harry, visiting Flury's was an experience of luxury and sophistication. The white tablecloths, the uniformed waiters, the glass display cases full of cakes and pastries, this was ""civilization."" This was what British culture meant.

They also went to cinemas, particularly the **Bangabasi Cinema in Howrah**, to watch ""cowboy films and cartoons."" The movies were mostly American and British, John Wayne westerns, Disney cartoons. These films populated Harry's imagination with images of heroism, adventure, and a world far removed from the crowded streets of Howrah.

All of these activities, the gardens, the tearoom, the cinema, reinforced a crucial message: **you are different from the Indians around you. You belong to a different, superior culture.**

# THE TRAUMA: WHEN THE WORLD FELL APART

**AUGUST 1946: THE GREAT CALCUTTA KILLINGS**

On August 16, 1946, when Harry was nearly six years old, Calcutta exploded in violence.

**The Muslim League had called for ""Direct Action Day"",** a mass political demonstration demanding a separate Muslim homeland (what would become Pakistan). The demonstration transformed into sustained communal rioting between Hindus and Muslims.

What happened over the next four days was horrific beyond comprehension.

**Estimates of the dead range from 4,000 to 10,000 people.** Another 15,000 were injured. Neighbourhoods burned. Shops were looted. Mobs armed with knives, clubs, and whatever weapons they could find roamed the streets, attacking anyone from the ""other"" community.

[Great Calcutta Killing](https://preview.redd.it/k6vvi38nzr5g1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3971ed897bd07fedf8c95556466e648c60ec084d)

**The Hooghly River became choked with corpses**. Literally choked, so many dead bodies were thrown into the river that the water itself was barely visible. The smell of death hung over the entire city.

For the Webb family living in Howrah, just across the river, the violence created immediate terror. Dorothy was at home with small children. The sounds of violence, screaming, fires, and the chaos of mobs would have been clearly audible. The fear would have been overwhelming.

The family fled to relatives in Calcutta proper, trying to find safety. They survived, but the trauma marked them permanently.

Years later, as an adult, Harry's mother would tell him about the Hooghly River choked with dead bodies. She would describe the terror of not knowing if the violence would spread to their neighbourhood, of not knowing if they would survive.

**For the Anglo-Indian community, the Calcutta Killings were a revelation and a warning.**

They had lived under British protection for generations. The British had maintained order, had kept the different communities separated, and had prevented (or at least controlled) communal violence. The Anglo-Indians had felt safe because they were associated with British power.

But the Killings showed that this safety was an illusion. When communal violence erupted, the British couldn't stop it. And more frighteningly, *in the coming independent India, where would the Anglo-Indians fit? They were not Hindu. They were not Muslim. They had been collaborators with British rule. Would they be targets?*

# AUGUST 1947: INDEPENDENCE AND INSECURITY

Less than a year after the Killings, on August 15, 1947, India became independent.

Britain partitioned the country into two nations, **Hindu-majority India** and **Muslim-majority Pakistan**. The border was drawn through Punjab in the west and Bengal in the east, dividing communities, families, and centuries-old shared histories.

*What followed was one of history's greatest humanitarian catastrophes.*

Hindus living in areas that became Pakistan fled toward India. Muslims living in areas that remained in India fled toward Pakistan. In the chaos and fear, terrible violence erupted. Trains arrived at stations carrying nothing but corpses, entire carriages of people massacred. Mobs attacked neighbourhoods. Women were raped, and children were killed. The estimates of dead range from **200,000 to 2 million people**.

Calcutta and Howrah, sitting right on the border between West Bengal (India) and East Bengal (Pakistan), experienced their share of horror.

For the Webb family, Partition created existential uncertainty. They had British ancestry and British cultural identity, but they'd been born in India and had never lived in Britain. *What were they now?*

The new Indian government, led by Prime Minister Nehru, articulated a vision of India for Indians, people who had fought for independence, who had suffered under British rule, who now deserved to control their own country.

**The Anglo-Indians were associated with British rule.** They'd worked for the British railways, the British postal service, and the British administration. They'd been privileged under colonialism. They spoke English and adopted British manners. In the eyes of many Indians, they were collaborators.

The Anglo-Indian community's privileged position began to crumble immediately. **Jobs that had been reserved for Anglo-Indians were now open to all Indians.** **The government prioritized Indians who'd participated in the independence movement.** **The special status** Anglo-Indians had enjoyed vanished overnight.

# AUGUST 1948: THE DECISION TO LEAVE

In August 1948, less than a year after independence, the Webb family made their decision: **they would leave India.**

They boarded the **SS Ranchi** in Bombay and began a three-week sea voyage to Tilbury, Essex, England.

**For Rodger and Dorothy, the decision meant leaving behind the only world they'd ever known.** They were both born in India. All their memories, all their family connections, all their social networks were in India. They were going to a Britain they had never seen, where they had few contacts, where their job skills and credentials might not be recognized.

*For young Harry, then seven-and-a-half years old, the departure was traumatic in a different way.*

He was leaving behind his entire childhood. The servants who'd cared for him. His school friends. The streets of Howrah he'd played in. The botanical gardens. Flury's tearoom. The cinema where he'd watched cowboy films.

[Bombay Dock](https://preview.redd.it/afdleajwzr5g1.jpg?width=681&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=585973096c943201a7c5293e2e811336c537e593)

India was the only home he had ever known. He spoke English with an Anglo-Indian accent. His cultural references were colonial. His entire identity had been formed in the world of the British Raj.

And now that the world was ending. The ship carrying them away from India was carrying them away from everything familiar into complete uncertainty.

The voyage took three weeks, three weeks of transition, of being between worlds, neither in India anymore but not yet in Britain.

# THE AFTERMATH: EXILE IN AN UNWELCOMING LAND

**1948: ARRIVING IN POST-WAR BRITAIN**

The Britain the Webb family arrived in was not the glorious imperial homeland they'd imagined.

**World War II had ended only three years earlier.** The country was exhausted, broke, and struggling. Food rationing was still in effect and would continue until 1954. Housing was in desperately short supply, entire neighbourhoods had been destroyed by German bombing, and millions of servicemen returning from war needed homes.

The British government was trying to rebuild the economy, establish the National Health Service, and create a welfare state, **all while dealing with the loss of colonial revenues and massive war debts to the United States.**

Into this exhausted, anxious, rebuilding nation came thousands of migrants from the crumbling Empire, Anglo-Indians from India, British families returning from colonial postings, and soon, Caribbean migrants recruited to fill labour shortages.

The Webb family initially moved in with relatives in **Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire**, then in 1950 were allocated a small three-bedroom council house at **12 Hargreaves Close, Cheshunt**.

[Sir Cliff Richard, childhood photograph](https://preview.redd.it/en44uy250s5g1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=968fb8d43fbbfea97591e58b502aeddb03aadfbf)

Council houses were government-provided housing for working-class families, small, standardized dwellings with basic amenities. *For a family that had employed six servants in India, living in a small council house where Dorothy had to do all the cooking, cleaning, and childcare herself was a shocking descent in status.*

**For Harry, now eight years old, the move to England meant multiple traumatic adjustments.**

# THE TRAUMA OF DISPLACEMENT

**The climate was wrong.** England was cold, damp, and grey. The perpetual drizzle, the short winter days, the bone-chilling cold, everything about the weather was physically uncomfortable compared to India's tropical warmth and bright sun.

**The food was wrong.** Instead of the spiced, flavourful food he had grown up with (Anglo-Indian food was a mixture of English and Indian cuisines), he now ate the bland, boiled food of post-war British austerity.

**The landscape was wrong.** Instead of wide streets, sprawling railway colonies, and tropical vegetation, he lived in a cramped suburban neighbourhood of small brick houses and tiny enclosed gardens.

**The language was wrong.** Harry spoke English, but with an Anglo-Indian accent. To British ears, his accent sounded **""foreign,"" ""Indian,""** marking him immediately as an outsider.

**His appearance was wrong.** Harry had inherited his dark complexion from somewhere in the family tree (there were rumours of Burmese ancestry on one side, Spanish on the other). In India, among other Anglo-Indians, this hadn't been a problem. **In post-war Britain, it marked him as non-white.**

# THE RACISM

Harry attended **Kings Road Junior Mixed Infants School** in Waltham Cross, then **Stanley Park Juniors** in Cheshunt.

**And he was bullied.**

*""He was even teased about his dark complexion,""* biographical sources record. The teasing wasn't gentle or innocent. Post-war Britain was deeply racist. **Despite having fought a war against Nazi racial ideology, British society maintained its own racial hierarchies rooted in centuries of empire.**

The ""colour bar"", informal but pervasive discrimination against non-white people, was everywhere. **""No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs""** signs appeared in boarding house windows. **Non-white people were refused service in pubs, excluded from certain jobs, and subjected to constant harassment and discrimination.**

Harry's dark skin and Indian origin made him a target. He didn't belong, he was **""other,""** he was “ **inferior**.”

The psychological impact of this racism would shape Harry's entire life. *He would spend years trying to prove himself British enough, white enough, acceptable enough.* *The trauma of being rejected, of being made to feel ashamed of his appearance and background, would inform his later artistic expression and his complex relationship with his own identity.*

# RODGER'S DESCENT

Meanwhile, Harry's father, Rodger, was struggling with his own crisis of displacement and status loss.

In India, Rodger had been a railway catering manager, a position with authority, status, and a comfortable salary. He managed staff, dealt with British passengers, and maintained standards. It was a middle-class position in colonial terms.

In Britain, in 1949, Rodger got a job in the credit control office of **Thorn Electrical Industries** in Enfield, North London.

[Cliff Richard and his parents](https://preview.redd.it/bd2gjjvd0s5g1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2bf4ee93eedf8d6f82cb4c4d439bd6be8cf3899)

**This was clerical work. Low-level office administration.** It paid enough to support the family, but just barely. It placed them firmly in the working class, *not the middle class.*

The family went from employing six servants to living in a council house where Dorothy did all the housework herself. From social status and visible wealth to struggling to pay bills. From being part of a privileged colonial community to being anonymous immigrants in an unwelcoming country.

The psychological toll on Rodger and Dorothy must have been immense. Everything they'd built, everything they'd been, everything that had given their lives meaning, all of it had been taken away by independence and partition.

And they were raising a son in this atmosphere of loss, anxiety, and displacement.

# THE TRANSFORMATION: FROM HARRY WEBB TO CLIFF RICHARD

**1956: THE AWAKENING**

For eight years, from 1948 to 1956, Harry Webb lived in displaced limbo. He went to school. He was bullied, he tried to fit in, and couldn't. He watched his parents struggle with money and status loss. **He felt like an outsider in the only country that was supposed to be home.**

And then, in 1956, when Harry was sixteen years old, something happened that changed everything.

He was walking down the street with friends. They passed a parked car with its windows open. Music was coming from the car radio.

The song was **""Heartbreak Hotel"" by Elvis Presley.**

https://preview.redd.it/g0s6yb6l0s5g1.jpg?width=503&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=708fe48ff4e11f1bb695a2dd5056c231aedb2661

Harry stopped walking. The voice, that raw, powerful, sexually charged voice, ""stirred something primal"" in him, as one biography puts it.

Elvis Presley was unlike anything British teenagers had heard before. This wasn't the polite crooning of Frank Sinatra or the orchestral pop of British radio. This was **rock and roll**, American music with roots in African-American blues and gospel, played with electric guitars and driving rhythms, sung by a young man who moved his hips in ways that made adults uncomfortable and teenage girls scream.

For Harry Webb, displaced, marginalised, traumatised, and angry at a world that had rejected him, Elvis represented something extraordinary: **the possibility of transformation through music.**

Elvis had been a poor working-class kid from Memphis. Nobody special, nobody important. And through music, through performance, through the raw power of his voice and presence, he had become a star. Rich, famous, and adored by millions.

**If Elvis could do it, maybe Harry could too.**

# 1956-1958: THE PATH TO ROCK AND ROLL

That same year, 1956, Rodger Webb bought his son a guitar.

It was a significant purchase for a family with limited money. But Rodger saw something in his son, the passion, the determination, the need to be something more than a displaced immigrant working a dead-end job.

Harry threw himself into learning guitar. He joined a **skiffle group** (skiffle was a simplified folk-influenced music popular among British teenagers, with acoustic guitars, washboard percussion, and simple songs). The Dick Teague Skiffle Group gave Harry his first experience of performing.

But skiffle wasn't enough. Harry wanted to play rock and roll, the real thing, with electric guitars and that driving rhythm that Elvis had.

He formed a band with school friends. They called themselves **The Drifters** (unaware that an American soul group already had that name). Harry played guitar, and Terry Smart played drums. They found other musicians. They started performing at local venues.

[Cliff Richard \(b.1940\) with the Drifters \(later The Shadows\), photo Harry Hammond \(1920-2009\). Photograph. UK, 1958.](https://preview.redd.it/np04r4tr0s5g1.jpg?width=633&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11b12cd223ad07180eced5ac78efe99b2fd8249b)

**And Harry began to transform himself.**

# THE CREATION OF CLIFF RICHARD

In 1958, the Drifters started performing at the **2i's Coffee Bar** in London's West End, a basement venue that had become the centre of British rock and roll. Agents and record company scouts came to the 2i's looking for talent.

One day, a songwriter named **Ian Samwell** came to watch the Drifters perform. He was impressed by Harry Webb's stage presence and voice. On the bus ride home, Samwell wrote a song called **""Move It""**, a response to an article he had read claiming rock and roll was dead.

The Drifters recorded ""Move It"" at Abbey Road Studios on July 24, 1958. The recording engineer was Geoff Addey, who later worked with Pink Floyd and other major bands. The recording director was Norrie Paramor.

During the session, Paramor made a crucial decision, **""Move It"" would be the A-side, the main single.**

But there was a problem, Harry Webb's name.

The band's manager, Harry Greatorex, said ""Harry Webb"" was too ordinary, too forgettable. They needed something with more impact, something that sounded tough and rock and roll.

They chose **""Cliff""**, suggesting a cliff face, something solid and dangerous.

They chose **""Richard""** as tribute to **Little Richard**, the African-American rock and roll pioneer whose raw sexual energy and musical audacity had influenced them all.

On August 29, 1958, **""Move It"" by Cliff Richard and the Drifters** was released.

Within weeks, it was climbing the charts. It reached Number 2 in the UK. And British music critics, who had dismissed every previous British rock and roll attempt as pale imitation, recognized that something genuine had finally emerged.

https://preview.redd.it/3scgarsx0s5g1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41170fc5a6bd340601d4ac6b15c7d60beabbd3b7

**Cliff Richard had become Britain's first authentic rock and roll voice.**

# WHY THIS STORY MATTERS

**THE VANISHED WORLD OF ANGLO-INDIA**

**Today, the Anglo-Indian community that produced Cliff Richard barely exists.**

After independence, most Anglo-Indians left India. They went to Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, anywhere in the Commonwealth that would take them. By the 1960s, the community that had numbered 300,000 had shrunk to a fraction.

https://preview.redd.it/lspb91t51s5g1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e32cec241bcb93c01af65339c5c6c2cc8e5156d4

The neighbourhoods where they lived have been absorbed into modern Indian cities. The schools they attended now educate Indian children. The churches they prayed in are still there, but the congregations are different.

In Howrah, *Dobson Road (now Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad Road)* is unrecognizable from the street where young Harry Webb played. The Anglo-Indian families are gone, the community that clustered there has scattered across the world.

[An Anglo-Indian bride and her family arrive at a church for her marriage. \(Photographs: Arindam Mukherjee\)](https://preview.redd.it/s4ovgtvb1s5g1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=610fb8679b94775998b8c1ee74f12e2fa7ce85e5)

St Thomas School still exists, still educating children. But it's no longer an Anglo-Indian institution. The cultural world it represented, English-medium education for children who identified as British despite being born in India, has vanished.

**Bow Barracks** in Calcutta (now Kolkata) survives as one of the last visible reminders of Anglo-Indian life. Built in 1905 for WW2 soldiers, then converted as housing for British railway workers, it became an Anglo-Indian residential complex. The barracks-style buildings, the narrow lanes, the communal courtyards, **this was classic Anglo-Indian working-class housing.**

[Many Anglo-Indians live in houses like these on Ripon Street.](https://preview.redd.it/f9xsdebi1s5g1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f16567bacb6e7c127e1fc70cb6a7711c7570044)

Today, Bow Barracks still has a small Anglo-Indian population, though much reduced. At Christmas, the community decorates the buildings with lights and stars, celebrating in ways that connect them to their vanished past. But every year, more families leave. The young people go abroad for better opportunities, the old people pass away.

[Community elders still frequent the Calcutta Rangers Club, which is run and attended mainly by Anglo-Indians.](https://preview.redd.it/3bce1x0o1s5g1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=925c2d424cddbda07d5e71244c2890b51b220574)

Soon, Bow Barracks will be just buildings, inhabited by people with no memory of the community that once lived there.

**Overall Verdict:** 4.7/5

# 📘 What Is Anabolic Fasting?

Brad Pilon—fitness coach and probable avocado enthusiast—designed **Anabolic Fasting** to combine **intermittent fasting and muscle gain** with **low-carb eating** and carb refeed weekends.

You eat in a **16:8 intermittent fasting** window. During the week, carbs stay low, fat goes up, and protein keeps your muscles happy. On weekends? Carbs return like a food-loving ex.

It's a mix of **structured carb cycling meal plans** and strategic timing. Basically, it flips your body between fat-burning and muscle-support modes—no wizardry needed.

# ⏰ How It Works: Weekly Format Explained

Here’s the routine: Monday through Friday, you eat low-carb, high-fat meals inside your eating window. **Fasting methods that don’t cause muscle loss** are rare, but this pulls it off.

Saturday and Sunday become **beneficial refeed days**. That’s when your body soaks up carbs, refills glycogen, and gets primed for growth instead of going limp like overcooked tofu.

This **carb cycling to lose fat and gain muscle** helps avoid energy crashes, preserves strength, and gives your workouts an actual purpose beyond survival.

# 🧬 Fat Loss Without Muscle Loss: The Science Bit

During the fasting period, insulin drops and your body taps into fat stores. Then, your refeed restores energy and keeps **testosterone and growth hormones** humming along.

You’re now using **an anabolic-style diet for body recomposition**. One that triggers fat loss while protecting lean muscle—no extreme calorie cuts or dangerous gimmicks.

Unlike crash diets, this **weight loss plan preserves muscle**. Your [metabolism stays intact](https://theworldhealth.org/anabolic-fasting-official), your gym progress doesn’t vanish, and you actually look stronger—because you are.

# 👥 Who Is This For?

If you’re training hard but still struggling to **burn fat while maintaining muscle**, this is probably for you. Especially if you're over macro-counting and food scales.

Busy schedules, work stress, and lifting don’t always blend. This plan fits a wide range of people, from gym rats to weekend warriors trying to **lean out while staying strong**.

Even **cutting fat while keeping your muscle** becomes manageable. Just prep your meals, drink your water, and avoid weekend donut spirals (unless they’re planned, of course).

# 📣 Real Results: What People Are Saying

People in fitness forums rave about this plan. One guy claimed **before and after results from Anabolic Fasting** helped him finally see his abs without feeling like he was in boot camp.

Others love the **recomposition results with intermittent fasting**. They’re dropping fat and noticing better definition in their shoulders, arms, and midsection.

There are mentions of improved energy, easier digestion, and *less guilt*. Especially since weekend carbs feel like a reward, not a cheat. It feels balanced, not extreme.

# 🧪 Tanya’s Experience

One of my close yoga clients, **Tanya D**, is a 38-year-old spin instructor I met at a weekend wellness retreat in Ojai. We bonded over our love for plant-based snacks and our mutual obsession with leg day.

Tanya's a total powerhouse—but even she was struggling to balance her muscle tone with her nutrition plan. She’d vent during our chats about how every time she cut calories, her quads seemed to vanish right along with the belly fluff.

So, she [gave Anabolic Fasting a try](https://theworldhealth.org/anabolic-fasting-official)—mostly because she loved the idea of structure without micromanaging every meal.

Tanya followed the **16:8 intermittent fasting** window, trained five days a week (with my workouts on Tuesdays and Thursdays!), and was surprisingly consistent with her low-carb meals during the week.

By week three, she looked noticeably tighter—her words, not mine—and said she felt more focused during her morning classes.

The refeed days became her favorite part of the plan (she lovingly dubbed Saturdays “Sweet Potato Day”), and she actually looked forward to them instead of dreading diet fatigue.

Her only gripe? The weekday meals got boring fast, especially since she doesn’t love eggs. She got a little creative with tofu and zucchini noodles, but still missed variety.

Still, she stuck with it for six weeks, lost about 9 pounds of body fat, and gained visible definition in her arms and shoulders.

Tanya told me this was the first time she felt like she could **build muscle while burning fat** without feeling like she had to choose one over the other. And coming from someone who lives in Lycra and teaches three spin classes a day? That’s saying something.

""My head feels like it's about to burst from the pain. 

Another night without sleep… I feel like I might collapse if I go one more day like this.

He dragged his tired body out of bed and went straight to the bathroom to wash his face. When he looked in the mirror, the dark circles under his eyes made him look almost like a zombie. He washed up, made himself a coffee, got ready, and headed straight to work.

After reaching his workplace, he sat in his chair, overthinking his life and the decisions that had led him here. While he was lost in thought, he heard some of his colleagues whispering about how William’s wife had cheated on him and filed for divorce, accusing him of domestic violence and demanding a large amount of money to withdraw the case.

Suddenly, his boss walked in and asked William about the situation. William shook his head and said, “It’s going okay.” His boss leaned in and quietly said he could help he knew the judge handling the case and could influence things in William’s favor. But William refused, saying everything was under control and would be resolved soon. His boss simply smiled, tapped him on the shoulder, and walked away.

William made a disgusted face as soon as his boss left. He knew the man never offered help for free and always expected something in return. William could tolerate extra unpaid work if needed, but he also knew his boss’s intentions were far from professional this man had a reputation for crossing boundaries and expecting disturbing personal favors.

After work, he stopped by his friend’s café and talked to her about his problems over a cup of coffee. After spending some time there, he went home, cooked something that ended up half burnt and half raw, ate it anyway, and lay down on his bed, waiting for sleep to take over  but it never came. He lay there like a motionless corpse, unable to relax.

In the middle of the night, he suddenly heard a noise, like glass breaking. At first, he ignored it, assuming it was just a thief trying to steal something. But then he saw a man standing at his bedroom door. Shocked, he froze. He couldn’t see the man’s face because of the darkness. William whispered, “Take anything you want… just don’t bother me,” and After hearing this, the strange man grabbed William’s leg and dragged him out of his house. William tried to escape, but none of his attempts worked.
The stranger slammed him into the ground ,shapeshifted his hand in a gun shoots William directly in his head 

William opened his eyes with a sharp, burning pain running from his skull down his spine. Panic rose in his chest as he touched his head he clearly remembered being attacked, yet there was no wound, no blood, nothing. His surroundings had completely changed. He was in an endless maze of yellow hallways, the damp floor giving off an uneasy feeling, and the constant buzzing of fluorescent lights making his anxiety rise.

William thought he had been kidnapped, and his first suspicion fell on his wife maybe she wanted money. He sat down, leaning against the wall, thinking about his life choices as tears slowly rolled down his cheeks.

Then he heard a sound from somewhere down the hallway. The noise grew clearer, louder After every second he turned his head towards the direction of noise and he froze in fear ",1,1765111319.0,BetaReaders,2,0.67,False

The first week of December at The New York Times is known as “Cookie Week.” Every day, for seven days, our cooking team highlights a new holiday cookie recipe. This year’s batch features flavors that aren’t necessarily traditional holiday ones — or even, for that matter, flavors. Instead, they draw inspiration from family night at the movies, drinks like Vietnamese Coffee, and perhaps most surprisingly, an Italian deli meat.

In this edition of the Sunday Special, Gilbert Cruz talks with Melissa Clark and Vaughn Vreeland from New York Times Cooking about this year’s cookies, and they answer questions from readers about how to navigate cooking and baking during the holidays.

1pghdie,https://www.reddit.com/r/printondemand/comments/1pghdie/how_im_actually_trying_to_start_a_lifestyle_brand/,How I’m actually trying to start a lifestyle brand with POD,"Whenever people search “how to start a lifestyle brand” it always sounds super abstract, but in POD it’s actually a pretty concrete pipeline: idea → niche → designs → POD → sales. Here’s how I’m structuring mine right now. I start with the “lifestyle” angle first, not the products. In Notion I have a board with columns for identity, values, visuals. Example: “slow mornings / coffee / journaling / introvert-but-aesthetic” as the core vibe. Then I run this through Etsy and Amazon search using Everbee or Alura to see what phrases people are actually buying around that lifestyle, and cross-check with Pinterest and TikTok search to see what kind of moodboards and outfits live in that world. If I can’t find at least a few overlapping phrases, communities and existing products that sell, I ditch the lifestyle and pick another one.

Once that’s picked, I niche the niche. Instead of “lifestyle brand for coffee lovers,” I’ll go “soft, neutral ‘slow life’ aesthetic for women 25–35 who like journaling, cats, and matcha.” I write 20to 30 phrases in a Google Doc that this person would actually say, not generic quotes: stuff pulled from Reddit threads, TikTok comments, Amazon reviews. My “tool stack” here is boring but effective: Notion for organizing mini-niches, Everbee for demand, Glimpse or Google Trends for seasonality, and then a spreadsheet with columns for phrase, hook (identity / occasion / emotion), and potential product (tee, hoodie, mug, tote, poster). If a phrase doesn’t instantly map to at least 2–3 products, I archive it.

Design stage: I try to keep it stupid simple and consistent so it feels like a lifestyle brand, not a random sticker shop. Right now my stack is Kittl for typography and layout, Photoshop (or Photopea if you’re broke) for cleanup, and then mockups with Placeit because lifestyle images matter a lot if you’re selling “vibes.” I pick 2-3 brand fonts, 3-4 hex colors, and lock them in for the whole collection. Every design gets exported in a small, reusable system: main logo / text layout, smaller chest print, back print, and a version that works on mugs or totes. I’m not chasing crazy illustrations; I’m chasing scannable, readable designs that look good at 1-inch thumbnail size and still feel on-brand when you scroll the storefront.

For POD + storefront, I’m currently thinking “validation first, empire later.” Etsy + Printify is my base: Etsy for built-in traffic and Printify for flexibility. My POD set-up is Printify connected to Etsy, with one main supplier for apparel (usually a Premium supplier with good reviews) and a backup supplier duplicated in case of stock issues. I use a simple workflow: upload design into Printify, create variants (limited colors that fit the lifestyle palette, not every color under the sun), sync to Etsy, then jump into Etsy to write human titles and tags (identity + occasion + emotion again). I use a tool like Everbee or Alura for keyword inspiration but I always re-write in my own words so it doesn’t feel like AI mush. Mockups: 1 clean flat, 1 lifestyle, 1 close-up of the print that shows the fabric/ink texture if possible.

On the sales part, I treat the first 30-60 days as data collection, not “omg why am I not rich yet.” I keep prices slightly under the market average, bake in “free shipping,” and focus on getting a few products to consistent views by tweaking thumbnails, titles, and tags before I add more designs. The only external traffic I push early is Pinterest and maybe one low-effort IG page that’s basically just my product shots arranged like a lifestyle moodboard. If a design starts getting saves and favorites but no sales, I’ll test micro-variations (color swap, phrase tweak, different garment type) instead of reinventing the wheel. That’s my current stack from idea → niche → designs → POD → sales for a lifestyle-focused brand.

1pghbef,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1pghbef/gastroscopy_uk_with_sedation_reassurance/,Gastroscopy UK with sedation - reassurance!,"Sharing because I was so incredibly frightened beforehand and couldn’t find much to reassure me; the internet is full of horror stories, and it was hard to find UK-based experiences.

Everyone’s experience is different, but here’s mine, I hope it helps someone. I’ll be as thorough as possible, but tl;dr version: it was fine, and I would do it again today if I had to.

I had a gastroscopy yesterday morning (6/12/25) at University Hospital Llandough in Cardiff, Wales, after being on the waiting list for 2 years. I have suffered acid reflux and upper abdominal pain for over a decade and have been on omeprazole long term, but want to stop taking this medication and so I’m keen to find the cause and treat it.

I had a phone call from the endoscopy department on Monday 1st December, the woman on the phone asked me some preliminary questions to confirm my medical history. She offered me an appointment on Saturday 6th, I chose 9am to get it out of the way. She posted out an information booklet with a consent form, patient info sheet and directions to the ward.

I was allowed to eat up until midnight of Friday 5th, and then I could have small sips of water until 7am on the 6th, nil by mouth following that. I did brush my teeth but was careful to not swallow anything! I didn’t take my pills in the morning as I wanted to be sure my stomach was empty, but the advice is to still take your meds unless you are told otherwise, I took mine later in the day.

I arrived at the unit around 8:50am with my mum who was taking me home due to me having sedation, and we had barely sat down before I was called through by a nurse called Carmen. To say I was anxious is an understatement, my apple watch was showing my heart rate was 120, I was in a cold sweat and trembling. Carmen took my mum and I through to an admissions room and she took her time explaining the procedure thoroughly and answering any questions I had. She took my blood pressure and pulse a couple of times as they were both very high due to my anxiety.

I am the kind of person who needs to know exactly what to expect so I had already googled extensively, but she told me the perfect position to lie in which was not mentioned anywhere else (left side, far over almost on your front, head relaxed with your chin on your chest and top shoulder relaxed and drooping - ‘zombie recovery position’. This gives the scope the path of least resistance!) Carmen was very patient and kind and put things into perspective for me. She was honest that it would be uncomfortable, but that I could make it easier by relaxing. 

My mum was sent off to get herself a coffee and Carmen took me to a preparation room where she inserted a cannula into my wrist. This was honestly the most painful part of the entire experience! I asked if the sedative ever fails as I have a high tolerance to drugs and was worried about it, she wrote on my file that I was very nervous and highlighted it so they would give me a bit extra sedative. They want to keep you calm and make it as easy as possible for you and the endoscopy team, so don’t be afraid to be honest if you are very nervous.

Carmen left me to wait to be called through, and after a few minutes a nurse named Dawn collected me and took me to the endoscopy room. The endoscopist himself didn’t actually speak to me, out of everyone I interacted with he was the only person I felt was just doing his job with no interest in the patient, in the nicest possible way! He wasn’t cruel or rude but he just wanted me in and out. Dawn asked me to lie on my back on the bed, and she inserted a nasal cannula for additional oxygen, as well as a blood pressure cuff and a pulse ox on my finger. The endoscopist sprayed the back of my throat with 10 pumps of the numbing solution and asked me to swallow, it tastes like bitter banana, if you’ve ever had a tequila shot you can handle this no problem!

I was asked to roll onto my left side and got into the position Carmen had described. Dawn fitted me with a mouth guard and put a towel under my head at the same time as the endoscopist administered the sedative, I didn’t feel this at all and was concerned it hadn’t been done until my head started swimming a couple of seconds later. The sedation made me feel sleepy and like I had had a few drinks, I didn’t feel elated, and I remember the procedure, just a little hazily. 

I don’t remember the scope entering my throat, my main concern was gagging and I don’t think I did, I was just aware of some scratching and fullness. It was a little bit sore but nothing major (but I remember being surprised it hurt at all since they always just say it’s uncomfortable). The next thing I knew I was burping like crazy from the gas they used to expand my stomach. I remember the endoscopist saying ‘biopsy’ twice, but I felt nothing. They told me throughout that I was doing very well, I think I may have been making some moaning noises but these were involuntary ‘sleepy’ moans! 

In a very short amount of time the scope was removed and i was asked to roll back onto my back, the mouth guard, pulse ox, blood pressure cuff and nasal cannula were all removed and I was being wheeled out to the recovery ward. I remember saying thanks and apologising for burping!

I was rolled into a bay in the recovery ward and again the pulse ox and BP cuff, everything was much more normal now. I was left for a while to rest, maybe half an hour, and then a nurse came to remove my wrist cannula while I sat on the edge of the bed. He asked me to wait a few mins and then I walked with him to a waiting area where he gave me a cup of water to sip and they contacted my mum to collect me. I was a bit woozy and very sleepy. He collected me about 15 mins later and we walked to reception where my mum met me and we walked out.

When I got home, I had a cup of tea and after about an hour had some soft weetabix. I was very tired and had a bit of a headache so I went to bed and slept on and off the rest of the day, and then through the night. I did eat a meal in the evening and had plenty of water and tea. I had a bit of a sore stomach which I think was from being stretched with air, but nothing major. Today my throat feels a bit sore but again, no worse than your average lead-up to a cold.

I hope this play-by-play was helpful to someone who is struggling with their anxiety about the procedure. I know not everyone’s experience is the same, and I personally was afraid that it would be horrendous but the sedative would make it so I couldn’t react, or just couldn’t remember. I saw horror stories about people panicking and being restrained and I was so afraid that would be me. I want to reassure you honestly that it is really not as bad as you are imagining. The discomfort was minimal and very manageable, the nurses were lovely and you CAN breathe and you CAN move. I never felt like I was choking at all, I was breathing completely normally throughout. I would have another one without a second thought. 

I had 2mg Midazolam and 75mcg Fentanyl for sedation, 10 pumps of the numbing spray, and I had two biopsies of my stomach lining that have been sent to the lab for testing. Everything looked normal on the scope so fingers crossed they find something in the biopsies and figure out what is up with me!

*Predicting the 3. Liga’s Most Desperate Derby*

**Odds Breakdown: The Math of Desperation**  
Let’s start with the numbers, because even in a league where teams score like they’re playing *Mario Kart* (see: SC Verl’s 2-2 collapse), math doesn’t lie. Waldhof Mannheim is the favorite here, with implied probabilities hovering around **50%** (per Bovada’s +2.0 line), while Saarbrücken’s chances sit at **32-35%**, depending on the bookie. The draw? A paltry **28-29%**, suggesting gamblers expect a decisive result. The spread (-0.25 for Mannheim) whispers that even a 1-0 win for the home side might leave bettors feeling short-changed, like ordering a “large” coffee and getting a thimble.

The Over/Under of **2.5-2.75 goals** leans toward a high-scoring affair, but given Saarbrücken’s defense (which has leaked 15+ goals in their last five games), it’s less about “scoring” and more about “avoiding a shutout.”

**Team News: Injuries, Comebacks, and One Coach’s Dressing Room Mix-Up**  
Waldhof Mannheim is riding high on the back of Terrence Boyd, their veteran striker who’s scoring like he’s auditioning for a Hall of Fame biopic. Four goals in three games? That’s not a farewell tour—it’s a *farewell address*. Meanwhile, coach Luc Holtz has turned the Carl-Benz-Stadion into a two-time happy place, with back-to-back wins that make you wonder if he’s secretly a wizard who casts spells between substitutions.

Saarbrücken, on the other hand, is a hot mess. Nine consecutive losses? That’s not a losing streak—it’s a *losing marathon*. Their recent collapse against Essen (leading 2-1 and losing) was the sports equivalent of ordering a pizza and getting a slice of cardboard. Interim coach Jürgen Luginger is rolling with “proven” playe

I’m currently planning my next few months of working remotely from abroad, and I’m finding the budgeting part tricky. It’s easy to find the cost of a flight, but estimating the actual monthly cost of living in a new city (Rent + Coworking + Food + Data) feels like a guessing game sometimes.

* Accommodation: Do you rely strictly on Airbnb monthly discounts, or do you have other sources for finding mid-term rentals that don't break the bank?
* Workspace: How do you budget for workspace? Do you just factor in the price of coffee at cafes, or do you set aside $200-$300/month specifically for coworking passes?
* Hidden Costs: What are the costs that usually catch you off guard when you arrive in a new country? (e.g., expensive SIM cards, tourist taxes, visa runs).

1pgh98d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/comments/1pgh98d/dog_greasesmell/,Dog grease&smell,"I used to like dogs. I even HAD large guarding breed dogs my entire childhood until I stopped living with my parents, but they lived strictly outside since my mother was always against having any animals bigger than a budgie or a goldfish in the house and because we had a large yard for the dogs to roam in and do their job as guard dogs. I'm saying this to preface that despite owning dogs, I never actually experienced what it is to actually live with a dog per se, prior to learning to despise most dogs and especially the majority of dog owners.

I have been vehemently anti-dog and absolutely anti-dogs indoors since college because my very close friend at the time had this absolutely unhinged neurotic lab that I have to credit for sparking my dislike of dogs and sheer disgust towards indoor dogs because this animal was INSANE. I would avoid going to their home because I was genuinely afraid of it. Ironically, I was the one who trained and disciplined my childhood dogs who were all very normal, usually passive, chill animals outside of barking at things on the other side of the fence or if anything was suspicious because hey, guard dogs have to live up to their names and earn their living. But this fucking thing was UNHINGED. It would bark for hours on end at NOTHING, lunge at other dogs, bit at least 2 people unprovoked, and they insisted on taking the fucking thing everywhere we went and ruined every experience of going out for lunch or coffee or whatever. 

I had an ex (that I've mentioned in some comments here and there) that had a dog when we moved in together that I ultimately had to get rid of for reasons unrelated to this post. I'm bringing it up because for the time that the dog lived in my house I was absolutely DISGUSTED of being in my own home. I hadn't noticed how bad it smelled because, to their credit, the ex bathed it at least weekly and kept a very clean house, and was also a smoker so the dog stank was covered by the lingering cigarette smell, and scented candles and air freshners that were a constant presence (they moved in with me because I never smoked and I imposed strict no smoking indoors rules which were followed to the letter). I obviously deep cleaned the house, couches, cushions, hell even walls and everything else the dog touched (thank god for at home carpet cleaners, baking soda, and steam cleaners) and my home went back to smelling clean, fresh and pleasant after the dog was gone. 

I had forgotten how absolutely disgusting these things are until recently when I went to a dinner party at some friends' house and they have a dog of their own. I could literally smell it before I even went inside. Everything in their house from the couch to the carpet to the god damn dishes was covered in stinking stomach turning dog grease so I feigned not feeling very well and just ate the finger foods I brought as appetizers and poured myself some wine after washing a glass with just my hands and dish soap when nobody was looking (i was reluctant to use their dish sponge). I picked at the dinner they served me a bit just to be polite because they're otherwise good people and caring friends.

I played nice, pretended to enjoy myself so as not to be rude, and even let the dog sniff me and gave it a pat on the head as it was actually well behaved, to give credit where credit is due and ultimately I can't blame the animal for being what it is. 

But then it all came to a head when I went to the bathroom to wash my hands after petting the dog and literally NO AMOUNT OF SOAP OR SCRUBBING would take the greasy feeling off the hand I pet the dog with. I just couldn't take it anymore. I made an excuse to call it a night since  we were a group of about 10 people so it wasn't rude or awkward and I didn't come across as bailing, and went home. I walked home despite the wind and snow hoping to air my clothes and hair out by the time I got home, but I could STILL smell the dog stank on me. I literally stripped down naked as soon as I got into the house and shoved everything I had on me (coat included) in the washing machine and put it to wash and took a hot shower to wash myself off and re-wash my hair. I literally even flushed my nose out with saline in the shower. 

How can these people live like this??? Genuinely, I can go as far as to accept that they go noseblind to the smell, and I admitedly am sensitve to smells, fine, but the GREASE on literally everything that you can't wash off no matter how hard you scrub??? 

Absolutely revolting.

Five Battalions for Los Angeles:

I

He set his bloodshot eyes on the town that was drawing near. The town beamed with a yellow haze of the sunlight, in his eyes it was his beacon of hope.

 He dragged his feet across the cracking road, manoeuvred through the broken glass on the ground and the skeletons that piled up along with the rusted cars. The man did not avert his gaze to look at any skeleton and figure out its story, he did not care that the blisters and splinters on his feet had grown purple and dirtied his internals with vile bacteria, he only desires sanctuary under a concrete roof and after he obtains that treasure. The wounds and burns, blisters and bug bites will be attended as best as this poor wretch’s mind knows how.

 Stepping off the highway and into the town, he glanced around his paradise for the next week, seeing humble structures that probably house tales worth telling around a warm fire and smoking cups of coffee. The man limps forward with one leg and with the help of both hands, brings the other leg to meet. He continues onto the petrol pump and upon reaching, standing in the middle of the road, he catches a glimpse behind the tall boxes with nozzles that have “88.54/ml” engraved into them, a glinting window that houses pleasant sights of packaged provisions and a row of three refrigerators in the back. (Expand here). *Still could be able to find fifteen till twenty bottles of drinkable liquid.* He thought,(expand thought) calculating how many commodities he may be able to exploit in his stay here.

Hurrying past the pumps and slamming through the glass door, he has atlast, found hydration that is other than his own urine and nutrition that is unique and more tasteful to the tongue than fallen leaves and bark. His heart tells him to flow free, push the valuable cartons of food onto the ground and swim in his pool of paper packages but the mind of this wretch is wise. It halts the heart’s corruption from reaching the skull and instructs the man to care for his wounds and then begin taking inventory of edible things he can enjoy.

He had seen a gauze on the shelf behind the counter on his way in, limping towards it, he steps behind the counter and sees a wide display of stained-brown packets of cigarettes and above a cracked screen that is as black and dark as this room he is in.

 The room smells like a wet-stained carpet but when he ventured a little deeper into the room, the scent there was overwhelming and made him feel his brain detaching from his skull. His wretched heart and broken nose could not bear inhaling it and so he has zoned that he will only occupy the first row of shelves and not trek towards the fridges until he finds a solution against it. (expand and fix)

He stretches out a decent patch of the gauze and leans his arm over the counter-top, swaying against the cold-surface and then pulling open the door into the counter’s mini-fridge. From it he took out a flat beer, “Won’t do much but here it goes.” he said to enclosing dustly-lit silence around him. He poured the contents of the faded bottle over the blister that caused him the most pain. It was a swollen, cruel hive of grime and looked almost as if it were bearing a child right there on his ankle. 

The liquid was like the colour of the autumn leaves outside and most of it slid off and landed onto the filth-ridden tiles beneath. He in quick fashion, wrapped his ankle with the gauze and picked up the roll again. He took out another patch and began working his way up to his knee, sterilizing and patching.(Flow fixes, expand sensory details, a little internal stuff)

This is going to be a long answer because I am going to share my breakup story.

KOTA LIFE:

So it started in Kota and we met through our mutual friend (let say Khushi) . One day I have to return test papers to my friend Khushi, so when I had gone to return papers, I was standing and waiting for her on the side of a road, and suddenly she came with her friend (my ex), and we greeted each other with a simple ""Hii,” and then I had returned her paper, and then I came back to my PG. It was the first time she saw me (my ex), and she developed a crush on me. Now after that, we met at the Diwali holiday.

It was a Diwali holiday, and the whole Kota class went to their home except those whose parents didn't call them (including me). Me, Khushi, and my ex (let her call Shreya) went out for coffee, and we sat at the restaurant and ordered three cold coffees. My ex has her big sister and she told her that she was going out with her friend. But as her sister also lived in Kota, she had a doubt, and she called her frequently to come back to the hostel; that’s why our outing didn't last for more than 30 minutes. After that, I went to a shop to take a chicken role because as all the markets are closed due to Diwali so I have to eat outside. When I was standing and waiting for my chicken role to get ready, I received a WhatsApp text from an unknown number saying,

She: “Hi, Shreya, this side!”

“Sorry vo meri didi thoda chinta kr rhi thi mera vo bhi kota rhh chuki hain to unko sb pta hain yha ka mauhal iss liye mujhe aane ko bol rhi thi.”

(Sorry, my sister was calling me frequently because she knows Kota and she was worried about me.)“

Me: I replied, “Arre koi na! Main samajh skta hu.

(Don't worry, I can understand). From there, the story starts of my relationship.

So from that day on, we started talking to each other over the phone and chat, and since we were in the same batch (by coincidence), we also asked questions of each other and helped each other in studying. One fine day in morning I was sleeping and she texted me,

She: “Mujhe tumhe kuch batana hain. Main ab aur nhi rhh skti meri padhayi barbaad ho shi ye sb soch soch ke.”

I want to tell you something. I don’t want to hide it more because it effects my study.)

Me: “Haan bolo kya bolna hain.”.

Yes tell me what you want to say.

She: “I like you.”

Me: “What??”

She: “Haan main tumhe ye bahut dino se batana chah rhi thi lrkin bta nhi pa rhi thi.”

(Yes, I have been wanting to tell you this for a long time but was not able to tell you.)

Me: “okay!!”

She: “Okay, kya tum nhi bologe kuch.”

(Why won't you say something?)

Me: ”I need some time to answer.”

Another day I agreed to this relationship after that when we were in Kota (we were preparing for JEE) and we were all droppers, so this all happens under 1 month after we met (we met in November or in October during Diwali 2022 and we came into relationship on 5th December) and after one month we have our first paper of JEE MAINS and we have prepared well for that so we went for exam; she has her exam one day before me, and our exams went well as per our imagination. We have planned to go for a bike trip to “GARADIA MAHADEV.” Those who lived in Kota know this place very well. It is famous for it’s perfect view. So we went to a trip after the exams. After the exams, when results came out, I got a higher percentile then her. She was very upset because one of her teachers told her that in drop year you won’t be getting good marks, and she can see it. I motivated her, helped her in every aspect, and prioritised her studies more than mine. We were in video calls for a full day studying with full focus and clearing each other's doubts. Now the dates of the second paper of JEE MAINS came out, and we started studying very hard day by day. We gave our exams, and results came out, and this she got a higher percentile, and me and I really got a very lower percentile because I prioritised her studies more than me. After the results, I cried a lot because of my mistake. She motivated me and after that, we started preparing for JEE ADVANCED. We have around 1.5 month for Advance exam and the time flies and the day came of the exam My centre went to Jaipur, and her was in Kota, so we were not there for each other on the day of the exam. We both talked on the phone before going to the centre. Our exams went well after the exam; our Kota life came to an end as we were not taking more drop If we failed. We have 3 days before going to home and we had a lot of fun during these days and we went to our home with the same train; she live in Patna and I live in Lucknow. We thought that this was the last time we were seeing each other face-to-face.

HOME :

We reached home, and after a few days, results are out of JEE Advanced, and she got selected and got an 11K rank in the Advanced exam, and I went into a trauma because I can see my failure (I can’t even qualify for Advanced). She texted me after the results; she was happy, but after knowing my result, she also went to trauma. We were broke. I got hate from everyone; everyone doubted my skills as I got much better marks in my 12th Advanced exams. I was in trauma for around 2 months and she helped me lot to get me out of trauma. I cried every night for around 2 months, and she was with me every night on a phone call, helping me to get out of this trauma. Parallel to this, our JOSSAA counselling has started. We started filling our choices of college and branch and after the end of counselling, she got IIT BOMBAY and I got NIT ROURKELA Now we are at a distance of 1500 Km.

College (the end of relation part: 1):

We started our college life, and during 1 month of the first semester it went very well, and after mid-semester exams there was a holiday of Dusherra of around 10 days in my college, and I went to Bombay to meet her (yes, we met again). I spent 3 nights and 4 days in Bombay; these were the moments I never wanted to let go of. The day I was going back to Rourkela, she told me to meet her friends, and I agreed. I met them; they were boys and a girl. But one other boy named, let him call “X”, I met and i said to her, stay away from him ( I don’t know but I felt insecure from his behaviour towards her). Now, the story begins I came to Rourkela and our end-sem were near so we started preparing for it and we gave our exams and our results came out at that time Also, I got more CG then her. Now she started blaming me, ” It was because of you We were talking the whole day How can I study then? I wait for your message whole day When you message me, I can talk to you. My whole day went out thinking about you. When will we meet again? She started crying and as always, I helped her in every manner I woke her up for studying I scolded her for studying because she told me I wouldn't study unless you scolded me. “ After that, she fights with me regularly, and I always try to keep her calm. I do everything for her that makes her feel calm, but all in vain. Now she makes excuses that she can't understand math, and there was a boy who knew math very well. I will study with him and will do well in the exam, I agreed (if she can earn a great CGP, I will always be happy). Now she studies with him. Nights when I call her, she doesn't pick up my calls and texts me, “I am studying. I will call you later.”. Now I can understand very well that she was losing interest in me because she was surrounded by the most talented brains of India. Time overflows with this and here came her birthday and I made plan to make her happy. I had written a beautiful shayari for her to feel special. I have also called her 30 minutes ago before 12 AM but all in vain because her friends take her to celebrate her birthday at 11:55 pm and I can’t even wish her happy birthday at 12 AM . After that, I called her 10 times but she didn’t pick my call She called me back at 2 PM because I have to wake up early in the morning so I have slept and can’t pick her call Now here comes the birthday gift. She was thinking that I would order a dress for her that she could wear to celebrate her birthday, but my plan was different. I have ordered a beautiful pendant for her and due to bad delivery service, the pendant came after a day of her birthday. She even did not open the box, and she returned it without even seeing it. Now this time I was so sad and so mad at her because it's not my fault I only tried to make her happy.

SUMMER BREAKS( final chapter) :

Now in summer breaks, one day I saw her story She posted a story on Instagram of his birthday (a guy named X). She was sitting on his laps on a chair, and the hands of the boy were on her chest area but a little above (I don't want to disrespect her), and the story speaks Happy birthday, X. I texted her with a screenshot.

Me : What is this?

She: What?

Me: Where are you sitting, and where were his hands?

She: I was sitting on a chair.

Me : Are you mad or what? You can’t see what you are doing.

She: Yes, it’s normal here; it is Bombay.

Me : Wow ! Now it is normal for that girl who doesn't even know what a relationship is and how boys react to girls. (Plot twist: She knows nothing about relationships about boys feeling about anything when she meets me.). She only knows about the relationship that “Both live together and help each other.” I explained everything to her and taught him how to deal with everything and how to understand anything. She was so immature. I like her immaturity, but I also helped her in every single situation and made her mature enough that when I am not around her, she can tackle every situation. But I didn’t know that, whom I made that mature and told everything about this cruel world, she would cheat me and go away. From that day, separation between us started and one day she told everything to her sister and she came like an enemy in our relationship She told her to leave me and date X and she agreed and left me behind like a fallen leaf.

Now she blocked me from every source through which I could contact her.

Around 3 weeks ago, I saw a reel of salsa night in IIT Bombay. I had seen her in the reel; she was dancing with that X.

Our relationship lasted for 1.7 years.

1pggzx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1pggzx7/the_small_house_atop_the_hill/,The small house atop the hill.,"I am 21 years old and I just moved back home to new zealand. I live in my hometown of rotorua, the place stinks of sulphur and cow shit. so I got comfortable rather quickly on return. Moved back into my childhood neighbourhood, same street, same house. everything identical. the only difference being, the hill I used to sled down in the snow when I was a child that was very barren and empty when I left. now had an old house sitting atop of it. it was obviously new in time, but it just looked, old. the boarding, worn down. the windows, boarded up and shattered. the roof, slightly caved in. and the doors, covered in graffiti and slightly ajar. A real eyesore, and it stuck out like a sore thumb against the sky’s backdrop. 

Once I had moved everything in, It was still early day so I decided to go see if any of my neighbours from my childhood remained living there. One by one, knock by knock. none of them remained. except for one, my good friend Tyler. he was a smaller man now, brittle and obviously tired. a severe contrast to what he was during his younger years. Once he realised who I was, he invited me inside for a cup of coffee, we exchanged pleasantries and I began to tell him of my adventures overseas. Once I was done, I looked up from my cup of coffee to notice him, sitting across from me. staring at me. a singular tear running down his cheek, and his eyes bloodshot. “You okay there buddy..?” I asked him, with a tinge of hesitancy in my voice. he didn’t break eye contact, but the tears came down in the dozens. “You shouldn’t have come back.” I felt the tension in his voice and the fear in his body language. he was terrified. almost like something was behind me, staring at him. “Hey, I think i’m going to leave now. it was nice catching up with you mate.” I said, and then quickly got up out my chair to leave, I covered the space from the chair to the front door QUICK. and I slammed it behind me as I stepped outside. 

I didn’t bother looking back. I didn’t want to. But I could feel it, him staring at me through the window. with that same horrified look. what the fuck could he be looking at me like that for? I didn’t do anything wrong. By the time I had gone over the scenario numerous times in my head I had already made it home on autopilot. I reached the front door of my house, and just as I went to reach for the door handle,
BANG.
The front door of the house on the hill, had slammed shut.
my head whipped around to face the house, almost giving me whiplash at how quickly I reacted. I don’t know why or how but I felt fear and an overwhelming sense of doom. but a slight sense of attraction and curiosity. I wanted to hide but I also wanted to march up that hill and investigate that fucking house just for peace of mind. why did I want to do that? I have no clue. but to my better judgement, I went inside my own house. locking the door behind me and quickly retreating to my bedroom, like a rabbit to its den. I tried sleeping, and I succeeded for all of a couple hours, I then got abruptly woken up to a loud bang again, and when I woke up, I immediately checked my phone. 11PM.

Fuck this, i’ve only been here for a day and this house and neighbourhood has already tormented me. No more. I make haste towards my storage cupboard and grab an old flashlight as well a Swiss army knife. I storm out of my house and up the hill, my bare feet pattering underneath me, and the tension in my body keeping me coiled like a snake ready to strike. except I wasn’t. I was ready to flee.
when I reached the house I tried kicking open the door but I just hurt my ankle and deeply regretted it. once inside, the house was illuminated by tea light candles, the shallow ones that only burn for like 2 minutes at a time. someone was in here, very recently if they were still burning. 
“HEY! IF YOUR PLAYING A JOKE ON ME THIS ISN’T FUCKING FUNNY!”
I screamed down the hallway of the house, hoping something would heed my warning and listen. I prayed this was all just a dream, but in reality it wasn’t. I tried yelling once more. 
“YOU BETTER HOoPe I DONT FIND YOU!”
My voice cracked, fuck. after I finished that pitiful attempt of bravery, I had a very wispy, airy laugh and then all the candles burnt out. along with my flashlight, it was flickering on and off and only illuminated a few feet ahead of me. I scoured this whole damn house. checked every room. every crevice. only to find nothing.

I left the house abruptly, stormed down the hill. and back into my own home. I threw the flashlight on the couch. along with the knife and once again, retreated back to my room. when I laid in bed again, I stared at the room for a brief moment, then I heard it. the door slam shut, again. except it wasn’t the house atop the hill. it was my front door. I leapt from my bed and burst out of my room, when I hit the hallway I noticed the candles, all burning and a very deep black. whatever was after me, I pissed it off. I tried hiding in closets, arming myself. but it always felt like it fell on deaf ears. when I stepped out from the closet with a small knife in hand, there was a figure, a tall lanky one standing at the opposite end of my hallway. it was pitch black. my house was dark but this was an obvious pure black. i could see it’s outline, everything. I watched it take a singular step, and instantly cover the distance between us. it loomed over me like a bully in preschool, and then it spoke. 
“It’s your turn.”
when it spoke, the voice echoed in my head hundreds of times over, like a loudspeaker right next to my ear. it was deafening and painful. and made me wince in pain and fall to my knees. I curl up in a ball on the ground, in pain. as it stared down at me. it just kept looking as I suffered. watching, learning, whatever sick shit it wanted to say it was doing. 

when the pain had gone, I glanced up at it and it had a very wide, toothy grin on it’s face. it’s teeth a very dirty yellow. it just continuously stared and smiled at me. and then it happened, it lunged down at me and sunk it’s hand into my chest. I could feel its hand tighten around my heart and begin to tug gently. then it began counting with each tug, “1….. 2…… 3……” and on the 3rd tug it ripped it out of my chest and held it infront of me to see. and then I watched as this thing bit into my heart. A surge of pain exploding across my body. Then, I woke up. in a puddle of my own piss. terrified of what had just happened. I was so embarrassed and frightened I needed to get up and change my sheets, but was too scared to leave my bed. I had to. I got up, stripped my bed and checked my phone. 11PM. then I hear it again, the door slamming at the house atop the hill. ",1,1765109796.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

I made a post about a concern about a situation with a girl at work and he said he hasn't messaged her back. When I was checking the work phone I saw NO replies from him. I took a photo of her number when he wasn't looking and kindly whatsapped her. 

She sent me ALL the screenshots and told me he came across and single and flirty. He made jokes about having coffee with her and finding another reason to see her cos waiting for a stolen laptop is a long time. ( Cos he attended a scene where her laptop was stolen)

And this morning he doesn't know I have the screenshots so I calmly asked him for the truth and he called me crazy starting speeding and told me he is sick of me asking and he didn't ever message her back!!! Wtf!!!!!!!!! Where do I go from here?? We share a flat and have a child.

Also do I really now believe this is the first incident in the 6 months he supposedly was sober? Doesn't seem like it.

We agreed to meet and had lunch at DTF. I was really surprised by how fine she was, and we even extended our first meet by talking more over coffee. After that day, I messaged her and confessed that I got hooked, and was genuinely interested in getting to know her more better.

Unfortunately, she’s not ready to have someone in her life yet because of past trauma (she was cheated on). Still, I have no regrets putting in the effort to get to know her over the past 3 weeks, even with me sending messages and getting delayed replies, and her never really checking on me how I was doing.

Today, I missed the chance to meet her because I got stuck doing errands and was late for an hour. After driving 13 km, spending on gas and skyway toll, I was simply told to go home. Sorry, P, I was an hour late. Driving back alone made me realize this isn’t for us. But thank you for everything. The time spent with you will always be cherished.
