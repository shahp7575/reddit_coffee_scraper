1p7uzew,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1p7uzew/video_essay_about_porn_addiction_never_once/,Video essay about porn addiction never once mentions the demonization of male sexuality. Plus my thoughts on the “goonicide” incident.,"You can watch the essay I’m talking about by looking up, “the disturbing world of gooning” on YouTube. It has over 1 million views so it’s not that obscure.

I don’t understand how stuff like this gets so popular. A video essay on porn addiction never mentions the need to destigmatize male sexuality or addresses why men and boys are pushed towards porn to begin with. Is it perhaps because, unlike women who are taught to be proud of their sexuality, men are stereotyped as predators and told that having sexual needs is disgusting and a thing to be ashamed of and hidden? No? Oh yeah, obviously it’s entirely social media’s fault that children are increasingly developing their sexuality online and in isolation. It really is a chicken before the egg situation, isn’t it? These problems didn’t start with social media and that never seems to be acknowledged.

What’s even worse is the example used at the beginning: a man is recorded with his pants off in the drive-through of a Hooters-like coffee shop, which is obviously a disgusting, horrible, and unjustifiable action. However, instead of just forwarding the video to the police, the manager decided to post the video online, which resulted in the man getting doxed and him committing suicide. He had a wife and son. What I find ironic about this whole situation is that the same women who make a living profiting off of the sexual repression of men, are angered and disgusted by it when they’re confronted with the inevitable results of their decisions in person. 

I don’t have any problem with sex work and I won’t pretend to know what situations in life led those women to work there, nor will I excuse the discussion actions of the man in that drive-through. However, when you yourself make a living off of men like this every day, either on social media or in person, I think it’s common human decency to extend a bit of empathy to someone who clearly has a problem, or at least his family, and think before l publicly humiliating him, (a form of mob punishment that has become all too accepted in our society)

Coffee quality is profoundly impacted by storage conditions, which must be precisely managed across varying climates and altitudes. High temperatures and humidity accelerate flavor degradation, while altitude influences bean density and moisture stability. Effective coffee storing requires understanding the distinct challenges presented by tropical coffee producing countries versus high-altitude storage points. Specialized coffee packaging solutions, particularly those that control the internal atmosphere, are critical for coffee exporters and coffee manufacturers to preserve the bean's integrity and value from coffee cultivation to the final cup.

1p7uval,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1p7uval/short_and_quick_rejection_or_should_i_explain/,Short and quick rejection or should I explain?,"TLDR: My old best friend and I reconnected a few weeks ago and we both know we are our ideal types in almost everything…He just confessed but weirdly enough I feel nothing. I don’t know what’s the better response.

When we were younger, we described our ideal types to each other.

Back then I had a crush on him badly but he was dating my other best friend at the time and so I kept it a secret until he confessed to me a few days after he broke up with my best friend. It was heart felt and sweet. It made me excited…until I saw my best friend the next day and I felt so guilty I had a huge fight with him and…Cut him off.

A few years later, he reaches out, we get coffee, and catch up. And boom we’re back to friends.

It was always easy with him. I met his family again and they gave me big hugs. I slept over at his place and we actually cuddled til I fell asleep (I have bad insomnia especially without physical contact, supplements, or overworking myself).

It was sweet and I felt relaxed for once.

Anyways, I just got done with my shift today and picked up some ingredients for tomorrow when I get this voice note from him with him texting after it “Listen to that in a quiet place”.

I read the transcript before listening cause I feel guilty that I haven’t talked to him in a few days cause it was busy at work and I had a flare up in my sickness. I thought he was going to tell me off…

 But…well he confessed.

And I don’t…feel anything.

When he confessed in the past I felt the same way honestly, like I am supposed to say yes. 

When we were cuddling, I thought to myself, “Maybe I should kiss him” or “he probably wants more”. 

I feel like with romance I’ve always lacked the “want”. My ex best friend that he dated? She tried to kiss and date me too after the break up as well 💀, the only reason I rejected her was because she was also asking out her other best friends at the same time (she’s poly).

My ‘friends’ have always had a romantic desire for me minus the ones I currently have now after YEARS. And it is so peaceful.

When I hug them or we have sleepovers, I don’t worry about anything else. I feel like I found my found family now without worrying about how I always fail in relationships. 

I broke up with my ex a few months ago as well and it confirmed to me, romantic relationships were…annoying.

I don’t want to date a thousand times to find ‘the one’, I’d rather go hang out with my friends. I do eventually want someone but even if I don’t, I’d rather raise kids with the help of my found family. 

I don’t feel bad rejecting him (respecting someone enough to tell them the truth is something everyone knows about me) but I do feel weird not being relationship fixated like I used to be or not knowing why I’m not interested in him. 

What should I say to him? I know he won’t take it personally but he will be self conscious of the potential reasoning if ‘everything should’ve lined up’.",3,1764224074.0,WhatShouldIDo,0,1.0,False

Six dates - first two short dates getting coffee and a drink, then two long dates ending at my place and then his, then two dog walk dates after work.

Almost two weeks ago we had a phone call as things got serious. He messaged me prior to the call just unsure about our physical/romantic intimacy but willing to continue. I thought this was more a signal to let him know I liked him, was serious, and wanted to deepen the relationship. We admitted we liked each other but I also shared frustration that if we liked each other it shouldn’t feel hard. I was just asking to see each other once a week on weekends to explore whether we could get there. I was definitely extending my schedule to fit in him but didn’t feel like it was reciprocated. 

Essentially since the last dog walk almost three weeks ago, he’s been sick and then went on vacation. At the end of the call two weeks ago, he said he would call later in the weekend but hasn’t. I had been doing a lot of the emotional lift up until then so think his silence is him sharing he isn’t ready, as he’s came out of something involving his ex cheating on him earlier the year. 

Given I was so open about my feelings, sharing that I just needed some reassurance, I’m deeply hurt at the silence. We had similar stable families, both wanted serious or so I thought, homeowners, like comedy and personal finance, just lifestyle compatible. He wasn’t intimated by me and immediately saw what I brought to the table. The silence and lack of closure hurts. I liked that he was not very digital but this is beyond my patience given I was anxiously attached and now really trying to be and find secure partnership. I feel like he never gave it a chance. 

Should I reach out or not? It just feels if he’s not ready, he’s just not. ",1,1764223897.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

1p7usdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorDash_Dasher/comments/1p7usdr/thoughts_from_a_new_dasher_to_new_dashers/,Thoughts from a New Dasher to New Dashers,"A few things that I hadn't read or noticed..

Everyone drives a car. But do you know how to use every feature in your car? Seriously, scan the owner's manual. Things happen, and not knowing how to open something or access the spare will add frustration for no reason. Think of this as learning part of the job. 

Go sit in your car for an hour, the entire hour..lol Learn it.  
Reprogram your radio, or play with your preferred music service, start some playlists. Your going to be in there a lot. If it's a newer car, learn your CAR app, either Apple or Google. I have a newer Honda with a large display that I am used to using. So I'm using the DoorDash app to hand the directions to Google Maps for display on my built-in display made a huge difference to me. Also, use the steering wheel controls if you can. I have a talk button that activates Google, I say ""Take a note."" and talk away. It shows up in the Google Keep app. I rattle off things to check out in town, phone numbers on vehicles, all kinds of stuff, but it keeps me focused on Dashing. Learn to use Google and Siri to your advantage.

Reconsider your phone mount. Mine is OK for daily/distance driving. It is absolutely shitty as something that I have to use multiple times an hour. The Magnetic Case and Magnetic Mount really made a difference. 

APPS kill your battery, a coiled USB cable keeps me connected. I also turned off the wireless connection to my phone. Much better boot-up experience using a cable over wireless. Faster back to my music TBH. When you turn your car off & on multiple times an hour, trust me, you will start to notice. LOL

Get some apps, Gasbuddy was a must-have for me. The cost of gas in my area can vary as much as 50 cents from one side of town to the other. If driving a few blocks off the main roads can save me up to $5 each fillup, I'll do it every time. Don't forget the loyalty programs for those stores. It adds up to free stuff or discounts.

Watch your spending. I wasted a lot of money the first few weeks on stupid impulse buys from the places I was stopping at. Look at your online statement. I identified $100 in the first week, where I could have done better. I realized I had not adjusted my habits.

Payment methods, be aware that Doordash Crimson Cards take about 2 weeks to arrive. Yes you can use it almost immediately using the electronic touch to pay app. I signed up and paid for gas an hour later using my earnings. Cool, Convenient. Could I pick up dog food from Walmart? NO! They do not take tap-to-pay. Thankfully, other groceries take it.  
So until that card arrives, I do not have immediate access to an ATM for CASH or certain stores. Something no one tells you.

This is stupid but it really works. Interact with Dashers & restaurant staff. I talk to everyone at every restaurant (when not busy). I have learned a lot of quirks about other restaurants, delivery methods, free food, free drinks, and discounts on personal orders. Being nice and chatty goes a long way. I dash a local coffee shop several times a day, I talk to the staff the whole time I'm there. Jokes, random facts, join in their conversations, whatever, they're fun.  Owner noticed my interactions with them and hooked me up with Store Merch & full membership to their loyalty program. Told me I was their favorite dasher ever. He said they talked about something I brought up the day before for an hour solid after I left, and that he got a real chuckle from his wife, who joined the conversation as soon as I left. She had been listening from the office..LOL  
I also go to a very busy fried chicken chain daily, the manager is usually up front expediting, I rarely wait long, she will bump my order. The very first time I was in there, it was crazy busy. I had been there 20 min at that point. When she handed me the order, I told her ""You are rocking it tonight, Thanks"". I have the best experience dashing to that location regardless of how busy they are because of her. 

Anyway, just random thoughts.. Happy Dashing!

I wasn’t willing to spend 200$ on a Sworks one, so when Lance mentioned and tested one from Aliexpress I pulled the trigger and bought it. I got the set with the puck screen for 14€. It’s a 58 to 49mm basket. 

I was only able to test ist with a „Italian style“ dark roast from Kaffeemacher:innen (which is quite nice for a dark roast) because I’m waiting for my new order. I’ll give an update once I tested it with lighter roasts. 

What I noticed was that I couldn’t really grind as coarse as I expected. It was only 0,2 steps on my Varia VS3 from 3,8 to 4,0. and when I compared the pucks afterwards I was quite surprised to see there wasn’t really that much difference as seen on the picture. Both are a 18g dose. 

But when I looked at my baskets it kinda makes sense. Depending on the coffee I use my IMS basket which came with the Mara X. As you can see it is tapered towards the bottom, resulting in a higher puck in comparison to my VST basket which is straight walled. 

So the next test will be between the VST and the stepdown basket. 

Taste wise the stepdown did taste a bit „rounder“ but since it’s a dark roast it’s difficult to tell. 

What’s your experience with a stepdown basket ? Did you compare the pucks ? And how much did your grind size change ?

Most robot vacuums promise barefoot-friendly floors, but I’ve been burned before. My old budget bot couldn’t keep up.

My MOVA V50 Ultra was a total game-changer. It vacuums and mops beautifully in a single daily run, and as my primary workhorse, it has been the champion of “no-hassle” automation.

But as I mentioned in [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/1oxs1sj/a_personal_update_and_why_the_z60_review_is/), this new review was shaped by a deeply personal and difficult journey. My beloved dog, the “why” behind my search for a truly automated home, was diagnosed with end-stage lymphoma.

This tragedy turned this review into something I never expected: a multi-month, 43,000-square-foot endurance trial. “Automation” was no longer a hobby; it was a necessity. I needed tools that gave me time back, not ones that created new chores.

So honestly, when MOVA sent me the new Z60 Ultra Roller Complete, their AI-powered smart vacuum and mop (as part of their Reddit collaboration program), I was deeply skeptical. I wasn’t expecting it to be that much better just because it had a roller mop. In fact, living in what feels like a Florida swamp in hell, I was pretty sure the oppressive humidity meant the roller wouldn’t fully dry, leading to gross mildew and negating the whole point.

What I found wasn’t a simple upgrade. MOVA proved me wrong… and right… all at the same time. The Z60 is a robot of brilliant, frustrating contradictions, and it’s not the V50’s replacement—it’s its rival.

# Receiving the MOVA Z60 Ultra Roller Complete:

https://preview.redd.it/mgb0dloxjq3g1.jpg?width=11249&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db199382005eb3ca8696bc9c682fa065b2aafb3f

I received the Z60 Ultra Roller in a fairly nondescript cardboard box, sealed with MOVA-branded tape. Inside was the main retail box, also covered in MOVA logos. It’s even heavier than the V50 Ultra’s box, which is already on the heavy side, so handle with care—I found it easier to lift because the box wasn’t as wide as the V50 Ultra’s. Sliding the main box out of the outer protective box took a bit of effort.

On the box, MOVA proudly lists all the bells and whistles:

* HydroForce mopping: A 10.08-inch (25.6cm) roller mop that MOVA says is a high-pressure deep cleaning mopping system, exerting 3.7lbs of downwards force and 4100Pa of scrubbing pressure. Like most roller mops, it’ll clean the mops in real time with 12 water spray holes as it mops.
* Fluffing roller: This industry-first fluffing roller revitalizes the roller mop’s texture, transforming it from a compressed, flat state due to high pressure to a soft and fluffy one, thereby increasing the surface area of the mop fibers in contact with the ground for improved mopping.
* AutoShield carpet protection: The Z60 Ultra automatically lifts its mops by 14mm and covers the bottom of the roller mop when it detects it is on carpet to avoid wetting it.
* DuoSolution tank: You can add a pet odor-neutralizing solution to tackle that dreaded pet funk, along with a general floor detergent in a separate, larger tank. The detergent mixes with water as it fills the robot’s internal tank for regular mopping, while the deodorizing solution is used specifically to clean the mop for stinky pets.
* StepMaster 2.0 climbing: It can clear small thresholds like small steps, door tracks, furniture legs, and other thresholds up to 3.15 inches (8cm) total—specifically, 4.5cm followed by 3.5cm. It can also cross a single threshold up to 1.89 inches (4.8cm).
* LiftPro Chassis: It can lift its entire body to better cross medium and high pile carpet without getting tangled by the carpet’s fibers.
* 28,000Pa suction: a wildly high number that beats the Dreame X50 Ultra on paper, putting it on par with even some cordless vacuum cleaners.
* FlexScope Navigation: The MOVA Z60 ultra can easily clean in areas with low clearance, as it can lower its spinning DToF to be 3.78 inches (96mm) tall
* MaxiReach cleaning: The side brush and roller mop can extend to reach corners and along walls.
* 80°C (176°F) mop washing: hot water mop rinse to lift grease from the mops.

But as you might already know, I don’t care much for spec sheets alone. I care about what actually adds value to autonomy or cleaning performance in the real world. So here is my in-depth review of the Z60 Ultra Roller Complete — and a closer look at whether these features actually live up to the claims.

# Unpacking it:

The packaging was solid and well-protected. Aside from some minor dents and cosmetic scuffs on the plain outer box (doing its job, really), everything inside arrived intact. The double-boxed design used thick, durable cardboard throughout. No complaints there—though I do wish the unboxing experience felt a bit more premium or luxurious for a flagship device.

Right at the top of the main box is the oversized accessory kit—and it’s stacked. You get:

* Three extra roller mops (enough for three replacements)
* 1L of MOVA floor detergent (the detergent tank holds up to 400mL, so this covers over two full refills)
* 200mL pet odor-neutralizing solution (exactly one full fill of the B tank)
* Three spare dust bags
* Three extra filters (rated for 450 vacuuming hours total)
* Two side brush replacements (designed for easy swapping every 200 hours with a screwdriver)
* A spare pair of double anti-tangle main brushes (rated for 300 vacuuming hours; note: replacing them takes a surprising amount of force to pull out and snap back in, with careful alignment of the hexagonal rods and brush holes)

Just like the V50 Ultra Complete, this is one of the most generous accessory kits I’ve seen bundled with any robot vacuum, especially in this price range. Most brands don’t even include a single bottle of detergent, even after charging this much.

Beneath the accessory kit is a smaller side box on the left, containing the dock’s detachable ramp (handy for cleaning), the power cable, and the robot’s mop pads pre-attached to the magnetic FlexiPress holders. Once that’s out of the way, you’ll see the main robot box with a sturdy built-in plastic handle for easy lifting. Under that, the dock itself is neatly packed inside a protective soft bag.

# Build quality:

https://preview.redd.it/7quz4kzyjq3g1.jpg?width=8064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc37e66e590e215e9356619c1d4fa3901bad9dc4



The MOVA Z60 Ultra Roller Complete and its base station feel impressively well-built. While mostly plastic, the construction is sturdy and durable. It is noticeably heavier than the V50 Ultra. The magnetic top cover feels luxurious and snaps on securely, no issues with weak magnets or misalignment. It seems MOVA has taken my feedback for the glossy cover for the robot, as the lid is now IMD treated for a premium-feeling pattern textured matte finish, which is much more fingerprint and fur-resistant. The brushes also feel solid and well-made. However, I’m not a fan of the glossy plastic finish on the base station’s lid. Since you have to handle it to access the water tanks, it’s a magnet for fingerprints and fur.

https://preview.redd.it/isrtzvqlkq3g1.jpg?width=8064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a041d8bd3d9ba65a78e2266c77583d066fc3dd9

The roller mop compartment is well-built with sturdy plastic, and the water outlets are well-designed, nearly identical to those of some wet and dry floor cleaners, allowing for even soaking to prevent streaks on the roller. The black base station does look more imposing in my home with its glitter-flecked finish giving it an almost sequin-like look. However, I’m more partial to a white robot as it looks nicer in my home and the Z60 Ultra is sold in a white color in South Korea so I’d love to see MOVA sell the Z60 Ultra Roller Complete in white. The dustbin is made from hard plastic, and I’m happy to report I didn’t drop it this time.

# Setting up the robot:

To test ease of use, I handed the setup over to another technologically challenged family member—and they had no trouble. Pairing the robot was simple, and mapping was surprisingly quick. Just like the V50 Ultra, the robot managed to escape my shower’s 3cm threshold using its secondary wheels, part of MOVA’s so-called StepMaster system. Older robots would have gotten stuck in there during mapping. I actually expected to configure this manually in the app, but like its sibling, the V50, the robot automatically recognized the threshold as passable and added it to the map. Nice.

It also recognized that my kitchen cabinets had just enough clearance for it to duck under by retracting its LIDAR, marking the area as low-clearance. That said, it struggled to identify the diagonal toe-kicks of my kitchen counter, which I had to manually fix. (I really wish MOVA would allow us to diagonally tilt low-clearance zones in the map editor). The Z60 is relatively thicker than the V50 at 9.6cm, and I admit I held my breath watching it squeeze under there with a mere hair’s breadth of clearance—but thankfully, it didn’t get scratched.

It mislabeled my bedroom as a kitchen and still didn’t get the orientation of the wooden floorboards right—but otherwise, room partitioning was fairly accurate. My family member noted a slight learning curve when customizing partitions, but once they figured it out, it was smooth sailing. I do wish there were more preset labels (like “Entryway”), but fortunately, you can rename any room manually.

The accompanying MOVAhome app has received a welcome minor facelift. The plugin’s thumbnail now features a cool animation reflecting the robot’s real-time status. A standout addition is the new dark mode which can sync with your phone’s system settings, making it a blessing for your eyes if you check up on your robot at night. The UI feels more intuitive overall; specifically, you can now dismiss “obstacle detected” popup windows just by tapping the empty space rather than hunting for a tiny “X”, which is a very helpful update for fat-thumbed people like myself.

It correctly identified the office rug and most of the carpet under the coffee table. While detection was an improvement over the patchy performance of the V50, it still missed a few spots, requiring manual adjustment to get it perfect. You can mark fully carpeted rooms as such, though finding the setting requires a bit of digging. A welcome new feature is the ability to specify carpet type, allowing you to select between low pile, medium-to-high pile, or a specific material.

After filling the DuoSolution tank with both the general detergent and the pet odor-neutralizing solution, and topping up the clean water tank, it was time to let the robot earn its keep. I didn’t actually have high hopes—so I ran the V50 Ultra a day prior, just in case.

I then ran the Z60 Ultra Roller Complete in CleanGenius mode where it was set vacuum first then to mop in their deep cleaning mode. I wanted to see if it was a CleanGenius… or a CleanDummy.

To my surprise, the kitchen—normally coated in a fine layer of grease that required two passes from my old robot—was squeaky clean in just one. To be fair, the V50 also takes care of grease just as well with one pass, but the tactile difference was undeniable. Walking barefoot, the Z60-cleaned floors felt noticeably more “squeaky clean” compared to the V50.

When I pulled out the dirty water tank, the results were undeniable: not only was the water noticeably darker than what my old robot usually picked up, but there was a visible layer of grease floating on top. The tank was greasy enough that I had to wash it with a sponge and dish soap, suggesting the hot water mop washing was actually doing its job and lifting grease effectively.



[A graph of the measured temperature at the water outlets](https://preview.redd.it/sn1ge2nmnq3g1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=11ad27a8450a05420a18110697c08393a034497c)

MOVA claims the mop washing system reaches 80°C, and I verified it with a thermometer—it consistently hit that mark and even peaked at 87°C. This isn’t just marketing fluff. The hot water genuinely makes a difference in breaking down grease and grime, and it’s refreshing to see a brand actually deliver on their advertised specs rather than inflating numbers for the box.

I do wish the CleanGenius mode gave more insight into what it’s actually doing. It just vaguely tells me “CleanGenius is cleaning” without explaining if it’s increasing suction, adjusting mop speed, or taking a different cleaning pattern. The results speak for themselves, but a little transparency would be nice.

The mopping experience itself is satisfyingly consistent. The mopping is quiet overall, though you can hear a low mechanical whir as it continuously pumps water to the roller. The result is absolutely worth it. There are no streaks, and it maintains a constant wetness level across the floor, unlike the V50, which is wettest right after leaving the dock. It also eliminates that annoying dry gap in the middle that appears when the V50’s circular pads shrink over time. Even after a 5-hour drying cycle, the roller mop remained noticeably fluffy, thanks to the fluffing roller in the robot.

[The original mess](https://preview.redd.it/ty9efgirnq3g1.jpg?width=8520&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d52b8b58e647abdfa527fe48fb153fb1d2421e8)

[After one pass](https://preview.redd.it/b7qjultunq3g1.jpg?width=6426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef09110d968c8c59f68a4d80995300c750fa05c3)

[After two passes](https://preview.redd.it/5e61ynhxnq3g1.jpg?width=4536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8fc25aa1e4502c2ad8f3b915ae1ee1adf1170b65)

[Three passes after, it's as if it never happened](https://preview.redd.it/2xksz8e0oq3g1.jpg?width=3111&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4119930f56ff7d4ada375d5c1b79fc5ec4df1f5a)

Since the Z60 handled the grease with ease, I had to devise harder tests. It tackled a dried mustard stain impressively with the AI obstacle turned off, as it would justifiably recognize it as an “uncleanable stain,” removing most of it in two passes and vanishing it completely with no residue after three.

[Grease from the mustard was effectively removed from the mop with the hot water mop washing](https://preview.redd.it/ud0ldxb3oq3g1.jpg?width=8064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b9291e8bdce0f945b3c783a7bc3e3c5ae1b7f41)

The final test was personal. I’ve been making homemade, dog-friendly strawberry ice cream to spoil my pup a little extra as he navigates his lymphoma battle. He loves it, but he’s an enthusiastic, messy eater. The Z60 made short work of the pink splatters he left behind, cleaning up the majority in a single pass and finishing the job in two. Even after facing these stickier, tougher challenges, the floors maintained that superior, squeaky-clean barefoot feel.

# The Science of Cleaning: Why the Z60 Succeeded

To understand why the Z60 Ultra Roller outperformed my expectations on grease and heavy residue, we can look back at the Sinner’s Circle framework I detailed in my [recent deep dive for Vacuum Wars](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/1netyob/spinning_mops_vs_roller_mops_i_used_a_1950s/). This principle states that effective cleaning relies on balancing four factors: Time, Temperature, Mechanical Action, and Chemicals.

A robot vacuum typically cannot increase “Time” (robots currently cannot soak stains) or “Temperature” (most mop with room temperature water). Therefore, to improve performance, it must significantly increase Mechanical Action.

The Z60 achieves this through three specific mechanisms that differ from traditional spinning pads:

1. Focused Downward Pressure: While standard mops distribute force across large flat pads, the Z60 applies 17N of downward force onto a concentrated cylindrical contact patch. This results in 4,100Pa of pressure directly on the floor surface, mechanically displacing dirt and grime that lighter pressure might simply glide over.
2. Surface Area Regeneration: The system includes an internal “fluffing roller” that spins at 1,000 RPM. Its function is to constantly agitate and reset the mop fibers. This prevents the matting that typically reduces a mop’s effectiveness over time and ensures maximum surface area is always available for absorption.
3. Continuous Debris Extraction: Unlike a pad that traps dirt and drags it along until the robot returns to the base, the roller system uses a scraper to mechanically remove dirty water and solids from the mop as it cleans. This allows the robot to continuously apply a clean solution to the floor, rather than relying on the absorption capacity of a single pad.

**The Chemical Assist:**

It’s also important to note that the Z60 did get some help in the Chemicals quadrant. As it was mopping with detergent, this helped break down the oil and grease by emulsifying it. This chemical reaction prevented the grease from simply smearing back onto the floor, keeping it suspended in the liquid so it could be successfully scraped off the roller and eventually end up in the dirty water tank of the base station, rather than back on my kitchen tiles.

These mechanical advantages, combined with chemical emulsification, explain the Z60’s success with the dried mustard and grease tests. The system was able to physically lift and remove the high-viscosity substances through force and continuous extraction, rather than relying solely on chemical dissolution or absorption.

# The Stress Test: The Physics of Sticky Spills

With the Z60 dominating grease, mustard, and even my dog’s ice cream splatters, I decided to push the mechanics to their absolute limit with a controlled “stress test” involving dried soy sauce and a concentrated 30ml spill of Coca-Cola.

To be clear, the robot worked hard—the onboard dirty water tank collected a significant amount of the liquid. But unlike the grease test, the floor was left noticeably sticky after the pass, and the soy sauce left a smeared residue.

**The “Victim of Its Own Hygiene”**

Here’s the catch: the Z60 is basically a victim of its own hygiene. That active water management system—which makes it a grease-killing machine—is also its Achilles’ heel here. Because the robot is obsessed with constantly flushing the roller with fresh water, the mop arrives at the crime scene already wet.

It’s simple physics. Think of it like trying to mop up a soda spill with a wet mop you just pulled out of a bucket. It picks up what it can, but without it being dry enough to absorb the volume, it just runs out of room for more liquid.

# Context Matters: Z60 vs. The Old Guard

However, I have to give credit where it’s due. I ran this same test with my old robot (a traditional spinning-pad model), and the difference was night and day. Because traditional pads can’t discharge dirty water on the fly, they saturated instantly. Instead of cleaning, my old robot spent the next ten minutes essentially painting my floor with a thin, Van Gogh-esque layer of Coca-Cola.

The Z60 might have hit its absorption limit, but it actually removed most of the liquid. The old robot just painted my floors with it.

# The Verdict?

For 99% of daily tasks, the Z60 Ultra’s mopping system is stellar. However, a good paper towel or a wet dry floor cleaner will be much better suited for much tougher messes and spills.

# Vacuuming Performance

While the Z60 Ultra Roller introduces a lot of new tech, the vacuuming experience is largely solid, with a few trade-offs compared to the V50.

# Carpet & Particle Pickup

On carpets, the “Carpet Boost” mode is incredibly potent—perhaps a little too potent for delicate surfaces. On my cheap medium-high pile carpet, it was aggressive enough to somewhat pull out fibers. For rugs like this, the chassis lift feature is essential. It worked well when engaged, successfully preventing damage, though I did notice a distinct mechanical sound every time the robot lifts its body up.

[The mop cover and the chassis lift feature in action](https://preview.redd.it/1p6h0kpqoq3g1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a44ceffd03b17a20b285c991f918daa533260750)

However, on my low-pile office rug, there were no issues at all. Regardless of the rug type, the results are undeniable: it covers the roller mop sufficiently while vacuuming, leaving the carpet dry and debris-free.

# Pet Hair & Anti-Tangle

https://preview.redd.it/3kq93mdvoq3g1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76db21f79ce3d0a569dfef7883b05cb32964cb98

[The antitangle rollers hold up great too](https://preview.redd.it/30eurxd2pq3g1.jpg?width=8064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5692b2447c746bd8e5708bda1f01b08b71856bf2)

The fur compression feature works well, effectively managing the shed from my corgi and maximizing the small dustbin’s capacity. You can also customize the auto-empty frequency (from every 5sqm to 15sqm), which is great for heavy shedders.

When I popped open the dustbin after a cleaning run, the difference was obvious: my corgi’s fur was visibly compressed into tight layers, making far better use of the limited space. The filter also collects significantly more fine dust compared to my older, pre-V50 robot—evidence that the Z60’s vacuuming performance is genuinely improved, not just marketed as such.

However, after auto-emptying, I often find a few long strands of hair clinging to the dustbin’s auto-empty door. Fortunately, I haven’t found any actual clogs in the robot’s auto-empty chute. Still, I’d keep an eye on it, especially if this is your first time with a robot vacuum and you have pets that shed a lot, as that initial volume of fur can easily clog the auto-empty chute.

# The Coffee Granule Test

To push beyond marketing specs, I simulated a tough mess using freeze-dried coffee—a mix of large granules and fine powder. I set the robot to CleanGenius mode with ""large particle boost"" enabled.

The Z60 performed admirably, but with one quirk. The robot:

* Correctly identified the spill and its size, marked it on the app, and slowed its approach
* Increased suction to tackle the mess
* Made multiple slow, methodical passes to ensure thorough pickup

The catch? On the first pass, the airflow scattered some of the larger granules before the vacuum could catch them. However, the robot persisted, and by the second pass, everything was gone—both the large granules and the fine coffee dust. The Large Particle Boost feature lived up to its name, even if it took an extra moment to corral the mess.

In daily life with normal coffee spills (a few stray grounds here and there), this scattering isn't noticeable. It only became apparent during this extreme stress test with a concentrated pile of instant coffee granules.

# Pet Odor Test

MOVA claims its pet odor neutralizing solution really works, so I put it to the test. I turned on high-frequency mode, which uses the solution every time it washes the mops, to tackle that classic “wet dog” smell after my pup’s adventures in the grass. After just one vacuum-then-mop cycle, the only place I could smell the dog was… well, on the dog himself. Floors? Fresh and odor-free.

# It’s loud, like pretty loud.

While the cleaning performance is stellar, the acoustics are a different story. On average, the Z60 Ultra is noticeably louder than the V50 Ultra—though, to be fair, it is still not as loud as my old robot.

With a clean filter, I measured the Z60 at 53-55 dB on Normal Suction—comparable to quiet conversation. However, in Turbo Mode, it jumps to 65-70 dB, which is noticeably louder and more disruptive.

# The Physics of Noise

I suspect this increased volume is a matter of internal real estate. The Z60’s complex HydroForce roller mop mechanism takes up significant internal volume, likely leaving less room for sound insulation materials compared to the simpler V50.

When it hits Max Suction or Carpet Boost, it is not WFH friendly. My family members frequently turn the robot off while working because the noise is too distracting to talk over. If you work from home, you will want to schedule this one to run while you are out.

# Drying: Silent but Slow

The one area where the Z60 matches the V50’s quietness is mop drying. The drying cycle is negligible—basically silent. However, the trade-off is speed. This is likely due to the design of the roller itself: unlike flat pads, most of the roller is enclosed within the housing, leaving only a small portion of its surface area exposed to the hot air at any given time. Consequently, it technically requires a longer cycle setting than the V50.

# Maintenance: A Daily Driver’s Perspective

After living with the Z60 daily, I’ve developed a maintenance routine that keeps it running smoothly.

**My Routine (If running every day)**

* Filter: Since the Z60 lacks the filter self-cleaning mechanism found on the V50 Ultra, I tap the dust out of the filter once every few cleaning runs to keep airflow strong.

**Bi-Weekly & Monthly Care**

* Mop Fluffer: I strictly follow the app’s reminders (usually every 30 hours) to clean the mop fluffer. If you skip this, fur will tangle around the roller mop, and you’ll quickly see that the fluffing roller is definitely not a gimmick. Because my corgi’s fur wrapped around the fluffing roller, some parts of the mop couldn’t have their fibers fluffed and effectively became matted.

[If your home is full of shedding pets, please do keep an eye on the fluffing roller as this is what can happen if you leave it alone.](https://preview.redd.it/exy4o5hfpq3g1.jpg?width=7680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=623ab62716140d6c3ab2352d155baa91d104b459)

* Onboard Dirty Water Tank: Honestly, I haven’t needed to clean the onboard dirty water tank that much; I mostly just see fine dust sticking to the sides. I clean it perhaps once a month by adding warm soapy water and shaking it, usually after the mop dries so I don’t drip water everywhere when removing it from the robot.
* Mop Washboard: Once every 2-3 weeks, I clean the washboard with good soap, water, and a brush.
* Mop Housing: At the same time, I use a damp cleaning brush to sweep away larger debris from the mop housing and use a Clorox wipe to pick up anything caught in the anti-tangle combs.



# General Smart Robot Care

* Deep Clean: Once every 3 weeks, I rinse the filter and the dustbin and let them air dry for 24 hours.
* Sensors: Like every smart robot with a camera, I just give the camera and sensors a good wipe with a microfiber cloth whenever the app tells me to do so.
* Brushes: The brush compartment is easy to clean as there aren’t many nooks and crannies to get into. I pop the main brushes off the metal axles (which takes quite some force), rinse them or give them a good wipe with a Clorox wipe, and wipe down the side brush.
* I just wipe the robot down to keep it looking clean like my floors.

# Real-World Drying Test

Living in a climate with 85% humidity and temperatures constantly above 90°F, I was skeptical about drying a dense roller mop. I set the drying cycle to the maximum 5 hours, but I found the roller mop and the docking area were actually bone dry after just 3.5 hours (the minimum setting is 3 hours). Even after using the robot for a really long time, I haven’t seen—or smelled—a hint of mildew.

# How Z60 Maintenance Compares to My Old Robot

After living with the Z60 for months, I’ve gained perspective on what “hands-on care” actually means in practice.

# With my old budget robot, my daily checklist looked like this:

* Rescuing it from cables and obstacles it constantly got stuck on
* Tapping dust out of the filter every single day (sometimes twice)
* Picking fur off the washboard after every cleaning run
* Running it twice a day just to keep up with my corgi’s shedding
* Dealing with a dustbin that was perpetually full of loosely packed fur

# Now, with the Z60, my routine is:

* Refilling the clean water tank and emptying the dirty one (same as V50)
* Tapping the filter every few runs instead of daily (no self-cleaning like the V50)
* Checking the fluffing roller every 30 hours per the app’s reminders and cutting off wrapped fur
* A quick wipe-down of the anti-tangle combs every few weeks
* Cleaning the washboard every 2-3 weeks (vs. daily with my old robot)

The bottom line: Yes, the Z60 needs more attention than the V50—particularly around the fluffing roller and filter. But it’s still nowhere near the daily babysitting my old robot required. The difference between “checking something every 30 hours” and “rescuing a stuck robot twice a day” is night and day.

If you’re coming from a budget robot, the Z60 will feel like a massive upgrade in autonomy. If you’re coming from the V50, it’s a trade-off: superior mopping performance in exchange for a bit more hands-on maintenance.

# Navigation & AI Features

# Obstacle Avoidance

In day-to-day use, the Z60’s obstacle avoidance is just as good as, and in some cases better than, the V50’s.

For instance, the Z60 was able to avoid my camera tripod on its very first run. In comparison, the V50 struggled with the tripod’s thin legs, repeatedly attempting to climb the low-angled legs for a few runs before finally adapting.

# Smart Detection

The Large Particle Boost proved to be more than just a marketing term. It worked exceptionally well in my kitchen, where dropped coffee grounds and crumbs are a common occurrence, ensuring they were sucked up rather than scattered.

# Battery & Charging

Both the Z60 and the V50 Ultra share the same massive 6,400 mAh battery capacity, but how they use that power differs interestingly in practice.

**Vacuuming Efficiency:** ***A Clear Win for the Z60***

Surprisingly, the Z60 is significantly more efficient when just vacuuming.

* Z60: 1.238 m² (13.3 sq ft) per 1% battery.
* V50: \~1.0 m² (10.5 sq ft) per 1% battery.

This makes the Z60 roughly 24% more efficient on standard vacuum runs, likely due to optimized suction airflow or better pathing algorithms.

**Mopping Efficiency:** ***The Cost of the Roller***

When it comes to mopping, the tables turn. The Z60 is slightly less efficient than its predecessor.

* Z60: 1.923 m² (20.7 sq ft) per 1% battery.
* V50: >2.0 m² (\~22.3 sq ft) per 1% battery.

This slight dip in efficiency makes sense physically: spinning and dragging a heavy, wet roller mop creates more resistance than the V50’s spinning pads. However, for most homes, this difference is negligible.

**Charging & Resume Cleaning**

Like the V50, the Z60 includes a battery charge limit feature in the app. You can cap charging at 80%, 90%, or let it charge to 100%. This helps preserve battery longevity over time, a thoughtful touch for a robot you’ll hopefully be using for years.

Charging speeds are identical to the V50. The robot charges rapidly (approx. 1% per minute) until it hits 20%, then throttles down to 0.5% per minute to preserve battery health.

* For Large Homes (100 m² / 1,075 sq ft+): You will likely trigger the “Resume Cleaning” feature. The robot will return to the dock, charge just enough to finish the job, and then head back out.

# PROS:

**Mopping Performance (The Z60’s** ***Superpower*****)**

* Effectively removes dried-on kitchen grease in a single pass
* No streaks; maintains constant wetness level across the floor
* No empty gap in the middle (unlike most spinning mop robots’ shrinking circular pads)
* Excellent on tough, dried stains (mustard in 2-3 passes, strawberry ice cream in 1-2 passes)
* Successfully eliminates pet odors with DuoSolution tank
* Hot water mop washing reaches 80°C (peaked at 87°C during testing)
* Roller stays fluffy after dry cycle (fluffing roller actually works)
* Water nozzles never clog with debris
* Onboard dirty water tank is well-designed and easy to clean
* Quiet mopping operation

**Build Quality & Setup**

* Higher build quality than V50 (IMD matte plastic lid, IMD brushed metal finish power button)
* Seamless setup and mapping process
* Generous accessory kit included

**Vacuuming & Efficiency**

* Fur compression and customizable auto-empty frequency work well (5-15sqm options)
* 24% more efficient at vacuuming than V50 (1.238 m²/1% vs \~1.0 m²/1%)
* Carpet Boost mode sufficiently covers roller mop, leaves carpet dry
* Can clean under 9.7cm clearance with retractable lidar
* Spill recognition works well (after firmware update)

**Drying System**

* Actually dries in 3.5 hours even in high humidity (85-90% RH)
* No mildew issues after extended testing

# CONS:

**Noise Considerations**

* Noticeably louder than the V50 Ultra when vacuuming on standard suction
* Carpet Boost mode is loud enough that my WFH family members prefer to schedule cleaning when they’re out

**Maintenance Trade-offs**

* No filter self-cleaning like the V50, so I tap out the dust every few cleaning runs
* Fur can wrap around the fluffing roller. I check it every 30 hours per the app’s reminders
* Anti-tangle combs collect some gunk and need a quick wipe-down every few weeks
* Drying cycle takes 3.5 hours vs the V50’s 1-3 hours (still completely dry, just slower)
* Overall, requires a bit more hands-on care than the V50, but still way less than my old robot

**Flaws but not dealbreakers** 

* A few long hair strands sometimes cling to the dustbin door after auto-empty (no actual clogs though)
* Tends to scatter larger particles like coffee granules before picking them up. In daily life this isn’t noticeable with spilled coffee grounds, but was only apparent when I stress tested it with a lot of instant coffee granules
* Carpet Boost is aggressive. I had to enable chassis lift on my cheaper carpet to prevent fiber pull

**Small Design Compromises**

* Base station’s glossy black finish is a fingerprint magnet
* Slightly taller (9.6cm vs V50’s 8.9cm), so it can’t squeeze under quite as much furniture
* AutoShield mop cover doesn’t always engage during vacuum-only mode

# TL;DR:

**Get it if:**

* You want one of the best mopping robots available in 2025 for tough, dried-on stains and kitchen grease. 
* You're worried about excess water on moisture-sensitive hard floors (the roller uses less water than spinning pads)
* Pet messes, muddy paw prints, or sticky spills are common in your home
* You need it to climb thresholds and handle mixed flooring
* You prioritize mopping performance and are okay with a bit more maintenance than the V50

**Don’t get it if:**

* You want the absolute quietest robot during vacuuming (the V50 Ultra is noticeably quieter)
* You work from home full-time and need a robot that won’t interrupt calls during Carpet Boost mode
* You have very low furniture clearance under 9.6cm (the V50’s 8.9cm height may be better)
* You want the most hands-off robot possible—while the Z60 needs more care than the V50, it’s still far less demanding than budget robots. 

# Final Verdict

After 43,000 sq. ft. of cleaning, the Z60 Ultra Roller Complete proved itself as a mopping powerhouse—but it’s not a V50 replacement. It’s a rival. The Z60 trades the V50’s whisper-quiet operation and hands-off maintenance for superior mopping performance that leaves floors squeaky clean.

For homes that prioritize raw mopping performance for tough, dried-on messes, it is genuinely one of the best robots I’ve tested in 2025. But if quiet operation and absolute ""set-and-forget"" maintenance are your top priorities, the V50 still holds its ground.

I’m happy to answer any questions in the comments!

***Full Transparency:*** MOVA provided the Z60 Ultra Roller for this review. I was not paid to write this, and MOVA had no editorial control over the content. I do get to keep this unit (and the V50 from the previous review) for long-term testing. After living with this thing through everything I threw at it (including some truly disgusting messes), I hope this gave you an honest sense of whether it’s right for your home, warts and all. If it’s not the right fit, no worries—I just want you to make the best choice for your situation.

I noticed she stares at me sometimes but idk if its cause my outfit is hard or if she thinks I'm cute ( or something other unknown 3rd variable )
She's shy and doesn't talk to anyone so i thought maybe i would try to cold approach after or before class and ask her for her number bc I think she's cute 
I told my close friend abt this and he instead suggests i ask for coffee instead of her number.
So the semester is ending in less than a month and I rly don't wanna regret missing out on the possibility of something good but like i might j be delusional and this woman could have absolutely no interest in me whatsoever lol

I'm stuck somewhere between ""full send and just ask her"" and ""nah she doesn't even know u""

Sobrang hirap pero thankfully nag success ako, sobrang desperate ko humanap ng way to get rid of my baby kasi kahit alam kong kaya ko/namin siyang buhayin mas nangingibabaw sa'kin yung part na hindi pa ko ready, btw im 24F, working as VA for more than 2 years now, same work kami ng live in partner ko at kumikita ng more than enough pero for sure hindi na ganon ka enough lalo pag nadagdagan ng responsibilidad.

September 8-12 — last menstruation ko, never kami gumamit ng any contraceptives talagang pull out method lang pero minsan pag napapainom partner ko or pareho kami ayun di maiwasan pagka wild kaya di nap-pull out, dahil sa gantong situation nag decide akong mag pills na 

Sept 20 — bumili ako diane35 pills, kaso upon researching kung pano ko siya it-take kasi di nga ko aware never pa ko nag pills before, need pala mag wait til first day monthly period bago mo siya itake

October first to second week — di naman ako nabobother kasi madalas akong delay dahil sa stress din sa work (12hrs ang work ko everyday at nag aasikaso pa sa bahay and sa small business namin), sumasakit pa yung puson ko which is normal symptoms ko kapag magkakaron na ko. confident pa ko na magkakaroon na q malapit na, kaso the next week sumasakit pa rin siya lagi pero di pa rin ako dinadatnan. Dumating na ko sa point na ihi ako nang ihi. Kaya nag search na ko ng mga symptoms ng preggy, don ko nakita na yung pagsakit ng puson at ihi nang ihi eh symptoms din ng buntis. Hindi pa ko nakakaramdam ng kahit ano bukod sa dalawang yan. Di kami accessible sa pharmacy at once a week lang kami pumunta ng bayan/city para bumili ng mga needs namin, so di ako agad nakapag PT.

October 28 — nag rides kami at gumala, papunta inabot kami halos 3 hrs and nag s-stop over kami dahil sa naiihi ako at nararamdaman ko yung sakit sa puson ko siguro dahil sa natatagtag, pabalik inabot kami 4-5hrs at nag s-stop over din kami dahil nga naiihi ako. That time bumili na ko ng 2 brands ng PT, ginabi na kami ng uwi pero gusto ko na agad malaman kung positive ako o negative kaya ginamit ko muna yung isa at kako bukas na yung isa if ever na mag negative man. At exactly 8pm, nag pt na ako and nag positive ako, sobrang bagal lumabas ng second line kaya medyo natuwa pa ko nung una kaso nung nakita ko na medyo malabo yung second line at unti unti na siya luminaw bigla na nanginig katawan ko. Sinabi ko na sa partner ko and di muna namin pinag usapan agad pero umiiyak na ko non kasi alam kong di pa ko ready.

October 29 — sinabi ko sa friend ko, at sabi niya magbasa raw ako sa reddit at maghanap ditp ng makaka help sakin kasi alam niya na pwede ako kumuha ng meds from WOW at WHW, yung sa kaniya namiscarriage siya at para malabas yung baby yung OB niya mismo naghelp sa kaniya na umorder from Fredli's (yes unbelievable kasi nga illegal siya dito pero swerte ng friend ko kasi nabigyan siya ng ganong option), at this same day din nababasa ko na may mga nahaharang na pills na from WOW pero nag take pa rin ako ng risk kasi don sa friend ng bf ko di na macontct yung local seller kung san siya nagsuccess, kaya sabi ko wala na kong choice try ko na yung WOW. Nag send ako ng 20€ sa WOW (nakipag negotiate lang ako) and ipeprepare na raw nila iship yung meds.

October 30 — na ship na yung meds so tinatrsck ko na lang. 

Hindi na pala ako nagpa check up kasi hindi ko maharap dahil sa work ko, at yung clinic na nag ooffer ng check up is available lang every Wednesday and Friday eh Tuesday ang day off ko at yung bf ko need pa isched yung off niya at magpaalam week before ng actual day off.

Nov 6 — Held by Customs (REASON: Awaiting presentation to border agency/security) eto na yung update sa WOW ko kaya naaligaga na ko lalo, iniiyakan ko na kaibigan ko buti na lang may friend siya nakakwentuhan niya at nashare niya yung miscarriage miya at pano niya nalabas baby niya sa kaniya, it turns out na yung friend niya na yon eh may pinsan na nagsuccess sa MA at supplier pala ng AbPill. Tinanong niya ko kung gusto ko ba mag take risk, nag oo agad ako kasi alam kong wala na kong pag asa sa WOW.

Nov 7 — kausap ko na si seller and kinakausap niya ko if sure na ba ako or something, talagang mabait at responsive siya. Medyo pricey yung meds (6k) pero wala na akong choice talaga kaya nag go na ko, same day ship agad.

Nov 8 — sinabihan niya ko na isesend niya raw yung procedure once na maclaim ko na, COD kasi yung through LBC yung pill nag dp lang ako ng 500, required siya. Nag ask din ako pala bago ma ship kung secured ba yung package at hindi ako magkakaproblema if ever, kasi nga takot din ako after ko mabasa na may narereceive yung mga nag order from WOW ng discripancy kenemberlu. Inassure naman ako ni seller na maayos daw pagka package, sinisilid daw sa short at hindi raw magkaka aberya.

Nov 13 — sinabihan ako ni seller na bili na ko ng mga needs ko (14pcs primrose at pineapple juice in can) kasi malapit na yung package

Nov 14 — ni pick up ko na yung package sa lbc and wala namang aberya nga, nagbayad lang ako and okay na at wala sa short yung package, nasa parang envelope na may bubbles lang siya na parang yung sa mga parcel kapag maliliit lang order mo. Nag update ako kay seller na nareceive ko na. Sinend niya sakin yung procedure, akala ko magdidirect na kami talaga sa mismong procedure pero need pa pala ng 7 days preparation — medyo matrabaho talaga, kasi yung isang primrose tinitake ko siya kada morning orally at yung isa naman insert siya sa vagi(naka elevate yung balakang at nakataas paa sa dingding) 1 hour yan. May mga options din na dapat mong gawin pero yung mga ginawa ko lang don eh uminom coke na di malamig, uminom black coffee no sugar, uminom ng pineapple juice in can, di umiinom ng kahit anong malamig pero nag tikim tikim lang ako, nagpatagtag (everyday naka angkas sa motor), nagbubuhat mabigat, may mga other options din at need mo siya gawin everyday — may mga choices ka ron, pili ka lang ng mga kaya mong gawin.

Nov 15 — nag start na ko sa primrose na pang morning at kasama ron yung pag steam (may mainit na tubig sa arenola tas uupo ka ron after one hour, gagawin mo siya  kada morning pagka take mo ng primrose at sa gabi before ka mag insert ng primrose) uncomfy siya sa feeling pero iniisip ko non tiyaga talaga.

few days passed, tinutuloy ko pa rin yung mga pag inom at mga pinapagawa sakin. except sa steam, kasi nagsearch ako na di naman talaga siya nakaka help para mag open ng cervix kasi surface lang naman daw ng vagi yung nasasakop niya.

1 night nakatulog ako at na forgot ko mag insert ng primrose sa gabi, nahihirapan din kasi ako. (2 nights siya nangyari actually) 

last 2 nights sa pag insert primrose, di ko na siya ni insert tinake ko na lang siya orally kasi nababahuan talaga ako sa primrose at sobrang baho ng panty ko pagkagising dahil don. Nov 21 yumg last day ko niyan, at nag chat agad sakin si seller na update ko siya what time ko gahawin procedure para mag standby siya. May work ako ng 12-4pm kaya sabi ko kung okay lang mga 5pm ako start at um-oo naman siya, 24 hours akong nag fasting start yung 24hrs after ng last primrose. pero pwede mag black coffee, coke na di malamig at skyflakes (nahirapan ako pero kinaya ko, kumain ako ng tatlong happy na mani kasi gusto ko na talaga ng medyo may lasa onti) 

Nov 22 — around 4pm nag prepare na ko ng need ko, tubig, yung mga meds, skyflakes, thermos at hotcompress. Wala akong kasama kasi yung bf ko need niya pumunta sa hospital kasi naka admit ang lola niya, at wala ring may alam dito na preggy ako kundi kami lang talagang dalawa pero umuwi naman siya ng around 7-8pm. 5pm nag start na ko mag vagi insert ng 4 miso nahirapan ako kasi ang nasa instruction dapat wala ka na makakapa na gamot bago mo iinsert yung panibago di ko talaga matodo yung pagkatulak at meron pa rin ako nakakapa kaya ni-go ko na. Yung position ko pala is naka elavate balakang gamit unan at nakataas paa sa pader.

After an hour, yung 3 miso inisert ko ulit. After 15 mins nag oral take ako ng 3 mife, at after 5 mins nag take ako ng 3pcs pa. Onti lang tubig na ininom ko kahit pangit lasa ng mife, tiniis ko kasi bawal tumayo, bawal umihi, dumumi o sumuka. Pwede mag diaper pero wag isasara pero ako nag pads lang ako before ako mag start, akala ko kaya siya ng pads na all night pero mag f-flow siya pababa hanggang likod kasi naka nga naka elevate balakang. kaya ginawa namin pinadugtungan ko sa partner ko ng pads para masalo siya. May naka ready rin pala akong tupperware incase na magsuka ako, pero naka help sakin vicks inhaler para kapag nasusuka ako sisinghot lang ako.

nag update na ko kay seller na nag start na ko ng 5pm, then 6:30pm nagsabi ako na natake ko na lahat mag wait na lang ako til 2am. Di ko na siya inistorbo kasi for sure need niya rin ng rest.

wala pa ko naramdaman mga 1-4hrs na sakit, mga 5hrs nararamdaman kong nag b-bleed na ko at 6hrs don na nagstart yung sakit ng puson, mataas pain tole ko kaya kinaya ko nag hot compress lang ako, nakatulog din ako non pwede matulog o umidlip basta mapapakiramdaman mo yung sarili mo na di bababa yung paa mo. Sakin ginawa ko medyo nakabaluktot paa ko tas nilagyan ko unan patayo para may alalay. 

At 2am, 9 hrs na ko in total and recently ko lang na find out na dapat pala in total eh 10hrs. Kasi mag start pala yung 9hrs kapag natake mo na lahat ng meds. pero luckily lumabas naman mga sac at si baby, sa arenola ako naglabas para mabantayan ko at masend ko kay seller kasi siya magcoconfirm kung success na ba ako or hindi pa. (may procedure rin after ng 10hrs kung di man lalabas si baby agad agad) sobrang thankful lang ako na lumabas din agad, nagsabi pa si seller na ang galing ko raw keneme kasi nga nailabas ko agad agad kasi marami raw talaga siya na naging client na di agad lumalabas yung baby dahil daw sa magalaw. Ako talagang tinyaga ko na kasi namamahalan ako sa 6k at sa mga needs ko during procedure, talagang no choice na lang ako.

2am pala, kumain ako non pero walang sabaw (dapat magsabaw daw) bago ko itake yung gamot na pag naka success  — methergine, every 8 hrs yon and 4 pills siya.

Today, Nov 27 — 4th day Post MA. Mga ganap sakin eh cramps na mas masakit pa siya kaysa kapag nagkakaron ng mens, normal lang daw yon at pwede ka mag ibuf keri naman ng ibuf. Normal yung bleed ko di naman siya heavy at di siya napupuno kada hour. So far wala akong bad effects na nararanasan and hopefully wala. May mga blood clots pa na nalabas, sa first day ko may lumabas na buong red tas may gray something siya tas sobrang langsa/baho, pero sa mga next day mga color red na lang na buo-buo. 

Hopefully talaga wala akong maranasan na bad effects, nasa stage pa rin ako na emotional at may pagsisisi kaya girls please make sure na ready at desidido na talaga kayo na mag MA or SA bago niyo gawin. Sobrang emotional ko to the point na umiiyak ako halos 6 hrs kagabi, until ngayon kasi grabe yung guilt at pagsisisi ko.

I am an international student attending community college, and I am having a realllyyy difficult time finding a university that will accept me. I started college in Winter of 2025, currently full filling associates degree of arts transfer degree, on my 3rd semester right now, and my GPA is 3.76.  I want to graduate college in the summer of 2026 in order to go to a university fall of 2026 (back to back because im an international student lol km). However, I still have about 6 classes to finish my nursing prerequisites and as well as my AA degree. 

All of the universities I’ve checked out require students to finish most or all prerequisites by their application deadline. Which doesn't leave me with a lot of options. What do I do in this situation?

 I thought of transferring to a uni as pre-nursing or to a diff major and then apply to a traditional BSN program, but it seems like a risky take and a waste of time. What do I doo?

—— or I stay in my college and graduate in december of 2026 (skip summer), and apply to a university in the state im at, but the problem here is, universities dont start till fall 2026. And i dont think my visa will allow me to stay for 8 month without school. 

—— Another option is I get my RN degree from the college im currently enrolled in. And then apply to a RN-BSN program. But the problem is that timing might not work because of tests and what not to apply.

1p7uj3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1p7uj3b/please_help_im_so_lost_i_dont_mean_to_be_that/,Please help. I'm so lost. I don't mean to be that person on here. My family is seriously abusive and I need advice though.,"**TL:DR**

Anytime I try to bring up the problems in the family, my family tries to turn it around on me like ""Oh you got groomed and sexually abused at 11? Well what do *you* do? You must've done something wrong. It can't be all their fault."" I'm dead serious. It's the darkest and most cruel behavior. They'll try to paint me as the villain for anything and everything.

Also, my cousin got molested, and when she told someone at school, later when she came home and her family found out they scolded her and she got in trouble for telling.

My family is very evangelical Christian based. They're very sexist, homophobic, ableist, etc.

My dad was a cartel member who was too dangerous to be around, so my mom left him and he's not in the picture anymore. I have no reliable friends. Talking to therapists isn't an option because I've been abused by mental health workers in the past.

**Some details if you want the long stuff.** (I'm also writing this long part out because if I do go back to therapy, it'll be easier to have it written out and let my therapist read this post.)

I was sexually abused 3 times in my life. By my grandpa who would jerk off in the living room in front of me when I'd get a glass of water or something at night. By a 14 year old friend who groomed me at 10 - she used to fuck herself on the phone trying to get me to roleplay sex with her and she use to cut herself if I wanted to tell anyone and get out of the friendship while telling me it was my fault and that if I did they'd lock *me* up for it. Also, by mental health staff when I later was sent to a mental hospital - they tore off my clothes, beat me, called me a faggot, whipped me in the face with a towel, etc.

I have a ton of problems because of it now, which they also blame me for. When I'm not able to do stuff my brother while try to bully me into doing some kind of harsh intensive labor that he wants me to suffer from to ""learn how to be tough"". He blames me for everything, for him bullying me, and for the times I was abused. My mom enables him and she's kind of on my side sometimes, but even when he's abusive she's never more than 50% on my side even if he's blatantly in the wrong, and she'll band wagon and abuse me in similar ways. She'll defend him even if he has murdered some of the pet animals we've had.  If I bring up any the trauma or any of the problems in the family, they attack me. If I bring up the things that happened, they blame me and say it was my fault because I got angry about it at the time. I haven't really gotten mad at them in years, yet whenever there's an argument about something bad that happened or that is currently happening, they use ""that one time"" I got seriously angry because of the abuse (literally) 20 years ago as their justification for abuse, in the past, present, and future. I was really mad at the time for about a year I yelled and was pissed at them about it all.

My brother has done things like beaten my mom into signing papers to put his name on the house, and to let him take a 150k loan out against it, which he ran around with throwing the money away on petty things and which he also used to buy a dying coffee shop that failed because of his incompetence. We also lost the house because of it. Before that he was growing illegal marijuana in the basement without a script (illegal at the time), and before that he helped my grandpa con my mom out of her house to live at my grandma and grandpa's and take care of grandpa because my brother wanted my grandpa's house. Before that he also used to go downtown and drop bowling balls off carport buildings, damaging public property, etc. Pretty much his whole life he's been that way. He blames me for all it and says it's my fault. He's hated me since I was born because my dad (not his dad) was abusive to mom. We left that situation when I was 3. My whole life he's blamed me and scapegoated me for his bad behavior, all throughout 31 years later. He paints me as the villain. Any time I bring something up that he did asking for an apology he tries to paint me as the villain. He'll twist my mom's arm practically to go along with it, and she will because it's more convenient to let me be abused.

I didn't tell anyone as a kid because I didn't want to be punished for it. I thought it would get better over time. It didn't.

I saved $24,000 dollars to get away from the abuse and move to Kansas. I bought a condo. I had a car (albeit one that had a rusted/breaking engine mount). I was trying to survive there is 113 degree summers and -24 degree winters. I had brought my mom with me because I felt that because she had also been abused that I didn't want to leave her behind, and I thought when we got there that we'd have a better life. She complained for 3-4 years and cried, while talking shit about me to my brother on the phone, and eventually she guilt tripped me into selling the condo and moving back. I did because living there I had bad dreams every night about missing my home state. This was a horrible mistake I realize, yet I don't know if I would have survived there anyway. My life savings was pretty much wasted, and it didn't work out.

They put on a kind face and talk about being good, and they're good at it so people fall for it, but they're seriously bad people at home.",3,1764222949.0,whatdoIdo,1,1.0,False

1p7uhi1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p7uhi1,Ox Bar & Hearth - Soft Opening Doing a lot of Things Right,"
Booked a soft opening week reservation for Ox Bar & Hearth (North and Clybourn). This is a more personal concept by the guys behind 3 Arts Cafe, Chef John Atsbury and Alain Uy. They had met earlier on at Trio, opened 3 Arts, and are now opening Ox. You can really feel the maturity in the menu, interior, and staff already. There are some normal, minor kinks I’m sure they’ll have worked out relatively soon; this was one of the smoothest soft opening meals I’ve had.

They’re calling this seasonal Midwestern. There is some clear technique and finesse in these dishes, while not shying from Chef John’s influences - from polish in the pierogis, to Syrian harissa for the carrots. Here’s what we ordered:

Foie mousse with blue Hopi cornbread & apple jam. We came out of the gate strong on this one. The blue hopi cornbread was incredibly flavorful, with that perfect outer crust while being so delicate and moist on the inside. The richness of the foie mousse, the acidity and sweetness if the apple, and the cornbread together might’ve been my favorite bite of the meal. 

Potato pierogi with cabbage, sauerkraut, and horseradish sour cream. The pierogi were so delicate and most had a beautiful sear on them. There was a perfect bite when you threw in the sauerkraut and sour cream. Maybe 1-2 of our pierogis could’ve used another moment in the pan to match the perfection of the others, but I’m nitpicking here. Arguably a comfort dish that will make everyone happy, and balanced really well. I’d eat a side of that sauerkraut all on its own btw.

Lettuces with cave aged cheddar, anchovy vinaigrette, and sourdough croutons. This salad was textbook and addictive. I don’t consider most salads addictive. The anchovy vinaigrette was delightful - it wasn’t too fishy at all, but also confidently played its part in balancing and coating everything perfectly. This is Caesar-like but better. Don’t let the description bore you.

Salt roasted carrots with harissa and pickled cherries. This may have been my most, “meh,” dish but it wasn’t bad. The carrots may have had a bit too much char on them to enjoy the full breadth of flavors, which supposedly was to include coffee. Overall, save the nice flavor from the harissa, these were a pretty standard roasted carrots dish and probably not something I’d yearn for again.

Charred cabbage with brown butter hollandaise and Rare Tea Cellar smoked trout roe. Best cabbage dish I’ve had in awhile - it puts similar dishes I’ve had recently at Gavroche and Creepies to shame. Textures, layers of flavor, the roe going off in your mouth like a party. This sets the bar and I’ll order it every time.

Rainbow trout with fried garlic and Aleppo chili oil. The fish itself was really fresh and much of the flavor was there. They cook this with the hearth (hence the name of the restaurant). Some minor qualms here: due to the hearth, I’d want the skin to be a bit crispier. My partner also ended stumbling into a plethora of bones in her pieces while I somehow avoided them. I know getting every bone is difficult, but at this price point, I’d expect it. Finally, I didn’t get the chili oil at all. Overall, this was a solid whole fish course but needs some tweaking.

Pork collar with rutabaga mostardo and black walnut cider jus. This pork collar was extremely tender and the fat rendered really nicely. They must be doing at least a 24 hour job on this thing. The jus and mostardo were packed full of flavor, too, so a bite with all together was heaven. If I had to nitpick, the pork itself could’ve used some finishing salt (something apparent when you ate a piece without enough sauce). I would definitely order this again.

Brown butter magic custard cake with tart cherries, granola, whipped cream. They threw this dessert in on the house, which was really nice of them. The custard really comes through and there’s good layer work here. Tart cherries were quite literally the cherry on top. I’m not sure I’d call this a, “cake,” in the way a Ukrainian napoleon cake or Asian-style crepe cake is, but that’s just semantics. It’s a good dessert and still felt light to end on.

The staff were very attentive and warm. A few seemed pretty nervous but that’s to be expected - they’ll get the hang of it. There were so many staff doing laps that sometimes them checking in felt redundant or slightly too much/often, but I’d rather have that than being completely ignored. The only real issue I’d like to call out: they asked in the beginning if we wanted bottled sparkling or bottled still water, not explicitly offering tap. We agreed to bottled still and they brought out Saratoga. Once our glasses were getting less full, some of the staff began filling our glasses with the tap still water they were carrying instead of pouring from the Saratoga bottle sitting on the table. This was an odd choice but not the end of the world - just want to mention it as an example of some of the minor kinks they’ll need to be working out going into their Dec 3 opening night. 

So, the final verdict is that Ox Bar & Hearth was quite good for still being in a soft opening. A lot of memorable bites, a beautiful interior that luckily doesn’t remind you of Burger Bar at all (what used to be in the space lol), and a lot of thought and personal connections in the menu. We’ll definitely be going back to try the things we didn’t order this time.",8,1764222797.0,chicagofood,0,1.0,False

This year I signed up for my first Hyrox because I needed something to look forward to during Vancouver’s darker months—something that would keep me moving when the seasonal slump hits.

For a while, everything felt dialed in. Training, work, recovery… all in a good rhythm.  
But then something familiar showed up again: getting sick every few weeks, randomly losing energy, and feeling like my body was constantly playing catch-up.

Since moving to Canada, I’ve always eaten well and meal-prepped religiously, so I could never figure out why my immune system tapped out so easily. And every time I missed a few days at the gym, it felt like my progress just evaporated.

This fall, the pattern returned. The colder it got, the heavier everything felt. My runs dragged, my lifts felt like I was moving through mud, and even with full nights of sleep I still woke up tired. I kept thinking, *How am I doing everything “right” and still falling behind?*

So I started digging. Fatigue and frequent sickness can come from a lot of things, but low vitamin D kept coming up—especially for anyone living in Vancouver where the sun disappears for half the year. It made sense. What didn’t make sense was how hard it was to actually *check* my levels. Getting a requisition for preventive tests felt nearly impossible, and lab wait times made it worse.

Around that time, I found a service called Numia that basically brings the lab to your home. I booked online, a registered nurse came to my place, a BC-licensed doctor reviewed my tests, and I got my results in under 72 hours.

And sure enough… my vitamin D was *tanked.*

Once I started supplementing and adjusted a few things in my routine, the difference was huge. My energy came back, I didn’t need three coffees just to feel human, and for the first time in months my training actually matched the effort I was putting in.

That experience stuck with me. It made me realize how much time I’ve spent guessing instead of just knowing what my body needed. So when the chance came up to work with Numia, I got involved. I know a lot of people are training for big goals while quietly dealing with the same issues, so I wanted to share my experience here.",0,1764222576.0,f45,1,0.25,False

Profile: 9/7/8 GNEM Fresher 
CAT: 96.53 %ile
Specialization: Marketing Slot: 9:45am, 5th Feb 2025
ID verified by 9:45

A case study at 10:10am was given the sheets for 20 minutes. The case study was about living with your parents as a mid-20s working individual, pros and cons. 
G1 started at 11am

Panel: P1 (Older guy, extremely lovely) and P2 (Younger guy, had a strong presence)
Candidates: F (Marketing specialization, BCom graduate, family business)
M1 (me)
M2 (Finance + BM specialization, BCom graduate, 30m workex in insurance)
M3 (Finance specialization, BCom graduation, fresher)
The interview started with banter, the panelists asking us to be human and let go of tense behaviour indoctrinated by coaching institutes

Asked us what they should ask to put us at ease, F replied hobbies, and I agreed, while the rest didn't reply. P2 joked that only F and M1 had hobbies, and the other two didn't because they didn't say anything. So yeah, that paints the picture for the whole interview. Very chill and casual.

Another thing adding to the friendly banter is that, due to pure happenstance, M3 got rejected in G1 last year by the same panelist (P1), which he thought was his fault because he couldn't answer some finance question last time, and so the panelist joked that seeing him must've ruined M3's day (it probably did lmao)
Actual questions:
TMAY, but not in your form
F: Talked a bunch about things already in her form

M1: Talked about my passion for things and love of working with people

M2: Talked about things in this form

M3: Talked about his interests, but also things in his form

I think they should've taken the liberty to talk about things not in the form more.
Actual questions started with F, who was asked about how a company would go about measuring brand awareness.

She initially struggled to get to the point of the question, but the panelist helped her find her flow, and eventually she answered well.

Then P2 asked me about how biology would influence consumer behaviour (he initially assumed I had biology in undergrad, but I didn't, so he told me to answer what knowledge I had).

Initially, I answered with generic ideas, but he encouraged and guided me in the direction of talking specifics (particular brain parts, pathways, hormones), and I answered well.

M2 was asked about his job profile, what he does, the tools he uses, and some generic questions about implications of his insurance work, which I think he fumbled a little in answering

M3 was asked to give his views on the questions, and he didn't add that much new info, so the panelists were generally a little dissatisfied
M3 was asked some specific finance things that I have absolutely no idea about (pardon me for financial illiteracy).

Questions moved back to me, I was asked how a coping mechanism could be used in marketing, I gave some examples of guerrilla marketing and talked about creating association of peace and serenity through meditation booth in a showroom (not quite happy with it, and I think the P2 wasn't quite happy either).

F offered to add marketing tactics of Zomato, which notify you things like ""if you're lonely, why not have a sandwich?"" etc, which I think was a smart answer, and the panelists shared my feelings.

M2 was asked about his hobby of cricket, but he didn't quite answer very well (they were technical things).
F was asked about her hobbies, and P1 asked what dystopian books she read (she mentioned she was interested). She also mentioned Asura and how Ravan's perspective was presented.

The discussion grew to the whole panel with P1 talking about how anything contrary gains popularity with the new generation. We were asked to give our views on the matter. I said it was more of a matter of perceptions (how people perceive contrarian views as inherently informed, even if it isn't true), and others were asked if they agreed.

P1 remarked he would only be convinced with Asura if Ravan himself was there telling his story, to which M3 rebutted that Ram didn't write Ramayan either, which we all agreed with and laughed. I commend his wit on that one.
Then we were led to the waiting room with snacks and coffee. I'm writing this while waiting for the results.
G1 lasted for 50 mins give or take.
Verdict: The Entire group selected for G2 (After 50 mins of waiting)

It was more waiting for G2 to start, but the adcom member guiding us around was nice, and we talked for 15-20mins about the interviews, life at SPJIMR, and such, which was fun.
G2: New panel, P1 late 40s P2 mid 40s, both women, had a strong presence.

My group was F (Finance, Fresher), M1 (me), M2 (Marketing, work experience in Career Launcher)
First question: You're in an elevator with Bill Gates, you have 30 seconds to introduce yourself and tell him why you admire him

I fumbled a bit here and didn't introduce myself, mostly talked about what I like about him.
F took it in the direction of Mahakumbh (was Bill Gates in India for Mahakumbh? Idfk), so we discussed the stampede for a little bit.

M2 gave an example of a Coldplay concert, so the discussion went there. Asked about what the hot news is about Coldplay (Panelists were looking for something specific, none of us had any clue about it)

P1 asked me about my favourite new psychologist, and I didn't remember his name, but I talked about the guy behind social constructivism and the postmodernist movement. They wanted to know far more details about social constructivism, so I went on a monologue for like 5-6mins. Not sure what they thought of it.
Then we were asked our key takeaway from the case study and our stance. That's it.

I am a M23.This all started when I went to my friend’s family function and she(24f) was there too. We knew of each other from college but never really talked or even said hi. On the day of the function, we both got very drunk and ended up having a random verbal fight nothing serious, just drunk nonsense. I was blackout drunk, so I didn’t remember anything.

The next day, I felt guilty and asked a friend for her number so I could apologise. Since then, we’ve been talking, and I like her a lot. I’ve been flirting with her, she knows it, and she plays along. She talks comfortably and never gets weird about it.

We’ve met a few times — 2–3 times for walks, and once for a proper coffee outing where we talked for 2–3 hours. But sometimes she says I don’t know her well enough. Some days she gives a lot of energy and we talk till 4 a.m., and other days she just sends stickers to keep the conversation going.

She also told me earlier that she came out of a long term relationship last year and still hasn’t gotten full closure. So I’m not sure if that’s affecting how she responds.

I’m confused about how to proceed because this is the first time in my life I’ve talked to a girl this much or hung out with a girl alone. I really like her and want to pursue her, but sometimes it feels like she wants something and sometimes it feels like she doesn’t. She has told me she hates forced conversations, yet she still keeps ours going.

We haven’t talked on the phone yet mainly because I don’t know how to ask her. 

What should I do?

TL; DR :

Met a girl at a friend’s function, got drunk and argued, apologised the next day, and we’ve been talking since. I like her and she flirts back; we’ve met a few times and had long conversations, but her energy is inconsistent. Some days she talks till 4 a.m., other days she just sends stickers. She also recently came out of a long term relationship and still doesn’t have closure, so I’m not sure how to move forward.

I grew up in a suburban environment, so I didn't grow up in areas where we call older folks ""sir"" or ""ma'am"" either. I used to be painfully shy around girls and rarely interacted with girls until I graduated from college, gave myself a style makeover, and gained confidence.

The only female that talked to me growing up were older ladies (such as my parents' friends, aunts, teachers/professors, or randos asking for direction or help with technology, etc). Some old ladies would call me terms of endearment when they thanked me and it never bothered me  One of the ways I gained confidence in the beginning was practicing making eye contact with waitresses/baristas and calling things like sweetie, darling, honey, sweetheart, baby, sunshine, sugar, etc. It has become second nature by now, so I rarely even think about it.

Yet this morning, I went to grab coffee with my sister (I'm staying with her and husband over Thanksgiving, they're both in academia) and she called me out for smiling and saying ""thanks, sweetie"" to the barista. She even clowned on me for saying I sound like an ""unc"" (insult for old man). I ignored her.

Later when I took them out for dinner, I thanked the waitress and deliberately complimented her by saying ""good girl, well done"" after I tapped my card. They both cringed so hard. My sister said I sounded like I was pushing 80.

I've worked it out with my therapist that its due to my childhood trauma filled with neglect. We are working through it with EMDR but haven't touched the binging yet, more so negative and positive memories. 

I'm now 200Lbs, believe to have Lipedema, I don't allow myself to wear a swimsuit, short sleeve shirts, long sleeve shirts, shorts, anything showing my ankles. My self esteem has taken over my life and so has my relationship with food. 

I attribute it to my mom. She binges, has her entire life. She isn't emotionaly available. Turned to food in negative ways. Was never there for be growing up. Showed me zero love. Got my period, did my mom talk to me about it? No. Needed a bra, did my mom get me one when I needed it? No. Underwear? No. I didn't have a bedroom door for majority of my childhood, we barely even had a floor, because my parents did renovations for 20 years. 

Its all these things that make me so angry at my mom. They are the reason I don't have a relationship with her now. I'm working through this with my therapist but it is hard. I feel like I have no control over my life. 

I sleep in, go to work (good government job), have coffee at work, bring a lunch most days of salmon, get home and have the same thing for dinner. Then I binge on anything I can find. A bag of chips, cookies, or sometimes I will just order a large pizza and binge. Some weeks I don't shower or wash my hair. I am not taking care of myself.

You might be stuck choosing between a hammock with stand and a hanging chair. Both options are great for chilling out, but they work in different ways.

**Space and Setup**

A hammock with stand gives you more room to stretch out. You can lie down completely flat or curl up on your side. The stand means you don't need to drill into walls or find the perfect trees. Just set it up wherever you want and move it around easily.

Hanging chairs take up less floor space, which is perfect if you're working with a smaller area like a balcony or apartment patio. They hang from a single point, so you'll need a sturdy ceiling hook or beam. The swinging motion is more upright, kind of like sitting in a regular chair that rocks.

**Comfort Levels**

If you want to take naps or really sprawl out with a book, a hammock with stand wins here. You get full body support and can shift positions without feeling cramped. Two people can even squeeze in together if you get a double-sized one.

Hanging chairs are better for sitting upright. They're great for reading, using your phone, or having your morning coffee. Some people find them easier to get in and out of compared to hammocks.

**Which One Should You Pick?**

Think about how you'll actually use it. Want a proper nap spot where you can fully lay down? Go with a [hammock with stand](https://athomewave.com/hammock-with-stand). Need something for casual sitting that doesn't take up your whole yard? A hanging chair might be your answer.

Price-wise, both options range from budget-friendly to premium depending on materials and features. Portable hammocks with stands are usually easier to store during winter months since you can fold them up.

**The Bottom Line**

Both are solid choices for outdoor relaxation. Hammocks offer more lounging versatility and don't require permanent installation thanks to the stand. Hanging chairs save space and give you that gentle rocking feeling while sitting upright.

If you're leaning toward the full relaxation experience with easy setup and portability, check out the options for a [hammock with stand](https://athomewave.com/hammock-with-stand) and see which style fits your space best.

It’s also interesting that James reaches the same conclusion as Scott Rao - that you really need the better filters (like the NextLevel ones) to get the best results.

Personally I get good results with a smaller brew than Scott and James recommend. I do 12-16 g, for example using 220 g of water with 14 g with a 2-2.5 minute brew time. And I get the best results by not touching it at all, even to knock down the floaty stuff like James does (probably less need when using a smaller dose like mine). 

Sorry, it’s probably not a very interesting brewer to discuss, since there’s far less scope for adjusting techniques to optimise the brew than a V60 or something. But it’s very cheap and it’s accessible since you don’t need a pouring kettle. And for me it makes coffee that’s more to my taste than almost every pourover coffee I’ve had outside of the London Coffee Festival.

Hey everyone,

Ever feel like you're stuck in a loop? You have these big goals, but the day-to-day just seems to get in the way. You end the day feeling busy, but not necessarily *productive*. I've been there, and it's frustrating.

Lately, I've been diving into small, almost stupidly simple ""brain hacks"" that have made a HUGE difference. It's not about overhauling your entire life overnight. It's about making tiny shifts that your brain barely notices, but that compound into massive wins.

Here are a few that are working for me:

*   **The Two-Minute Rule:** This one is a classic for a reason. If a task pops into your head that will take less than two minutes to complete, do it *immediately*. Answering that email, putting your dish in the dishwasher, tidying your desk. It kills procrastination and gives you these tiny hits of dopamine that build momentum. 🏆

*   **Habit Stacking:** Your brain is lazy and loves routines. So, stack a new habit you want to build onto one you already have. For example: ""After I pour my morning coffee (existing habit), I will stretch for one minute (new habit)."" It’s so much easier than trying to create a new routine from scratch.

*   **The ""I Get To"" Reframe:** This is a pure mindset shift. Instead of thinking ""Ugh, I *have* to go to the gym,"" switch it to ""I *get* to move my body."" Instead of ""I *have* to work on this project,"" try ""I *get* to use my skills to create something."" It changes the feeling from a burden to an opportunity. It feels cheesy at first, but it works.

Of course, sometimes these hacks feel impossible to implement. You know *what* you should be doing, but there's a deeper resistance. For me, I realized a lot of my procrastination was tied to a fear of not being good enough. It wasn't about laziness; it was about emotional baggage.

I worked through a lot of that by getting some structured support. If you feel like your mindset is the *real* thing holding you back from being consistent, it might be worth checking out [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme). It really helped me clear out the mental clutter so I could actually start using these strategies effectively.

At the end of the day, it's all about building a system of small wins that makes you feel unstoppable.

So, what's a small brain hack or daily win that's been a game-changer for you lately? Let's get a good list going in the comments! 👇",1,1764221084.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

We talk about self-improvement, ambition, mental clarity but almost every convo ends with, ""Yeah, but I stayed up late scrolling TikTok"" or ""I wanted to journal but fell asleep watching Netflix."" This is way more common than we think. Most people live life in reactive mode - responding to texts, emails, chaos - all day long. No space to *think*.

Then I started diving into the morning routines of high-functioning people - from authors to athletes to scientists. Not the TikTok hustle bro versions, but actual researched, proven strategies from books, podcasts, neuroscience. What I found floored me.

Most people aren't lazy. They're just *distracted*. But a morning routine, done right, creates the conditions for clarity, ambition, and that effortlessly put-together feeling people think is ""genetic."" It's not. It's structure. And it starts with waking up before the noise begins.

Here's what changes when you start waking up earlier - and how to actually *make it work*. This isn't about 5AM misery. It's about claiming *uninterrupted cognitive bandwidth*.

Backed by books, psychology, and high performers. Zero fluff.

---

**You tap into undisrupted brainpower before the world gets noisy**

According to **Daniel Pink's book ""When""**, most people's peak analytical thinking happens *early in the day*, right after waking. Your prefrontal cortex is most active during what he calls ""the peak phase."" This is when your decision-making and focus are strongest. Most waste it replying to texts or checking headlines.

Cognitive scientists at **MIT found that students who started classes earlier had significantly better academic performance**, due in part to better circadian alignment and increased morning focus.

Waking up early gives you 1-3 golden hours when your mental energy is fresh and less scattered. Use it intentionally, and it compounds like crazy.

**You finally get time for the habits you always say you want**

**BJ Fogg**, behavior scientist at Stanford, emphasizes that habit design is less about motivation, more about *context*. Mornings are the one part of your day you control. No meetings, no emails, no interruptions. Just you and the quiet.

That novel you want to write? That book you've been meaning to read? Meditation? You'll never get to it at 9PM when the day's wrecked you. But 6AM? Silent house. No distractions. Real momentum.

Even walking in silence improves mental state. Neuroscientist **Andrew Huberman** explains in his podcast that morning sunlight and forward movement activate dopamine and serotonin pathways through visual motion and circadian entrainment. Translation: you'll feel awake, focused, and less anxious.

**Your emotional regulation improves (seriously)**

A study published in the journal *Emotion* (APA, 2012) found that people who shifted their wake-up times earlier experienced *lower levels of negative rumination* and *more stable moods* throughout the day.

There's also something called **""social jet lag""**, a term from the book *Internal Time* by Till Roenneberg. When your sleep schedule is misaligned with your natural rhythm, it mimics the effects of jet lag - mood swings, irritability, poor impulse control. Fixing this by waking up at the same early time helps your body stabilize.

**You start looking more put together - without trying**

Sleep researchers at **Uppsala University** found that people who wake earlier consistently have better skin hydration, less puffy eyes, and report more morning energy. Why? Waking up early *with enough sleep* allows your cortisol levels to rise naturally - which regulates inflammation and improves skin repair.

Plus, morning time gives space for skincare routines, movement, and hydration instead of sprinting out the door in chaos. A consistent ""I do things calmly"" energy starts to show - and people notice.

**You reduce decision fatigue - and that's the real productivity cheat code**

Starting your day early lets you *front-load* decisions. You choose your top tasks. You eat the frog. You set an intention for the day. It's quiet enough to think clearly.

This lines up with research from **Roy Baumeister** on ego depletion - our decision-making energy runs out throughout the day. If you start your day scrolling and reacting, you've already used up your limited cognitive fuel.

High performers like **Naval Ravikant** and **Cal Newport** swear by early morning ""deep work"" blocks because they protect energy. It's less about grinding, more about being *strategic* with your best attention bandwidth.

---

*How to actually start (without hating your life):*

**Go to bed earlier - even just by 15-30 mins**

- Use **blue light blockers** or apps like f.lux two hours before bed. It helps reset melatonin response.
- Keep your phone outside the bedroom. Or charge it across the room.

**Start with wake-up anchors**

- Put something meaningful *right after waking up*. A walk while listening to a favorite podcast. Journaling with coffee. Reading fiction.
- Dopamine loves rewards. Give your brain something to look forward to.

**Make your first 90 minutes *unavailable***

- No emails. No texts. No social. Just your goals.
- Use the **""Phone Box Method""** (from author Jake Knapp): don't talk to your phone till after your intentional morning time is done.

---

This isn't about owning the day with #grindset energy. It's a pattern interrupt. You're creating a life that feels 10% better *every day*, just by shifting the first few hours. Most people won't do this. That's exactly why it works.

Like how hard can it be to make hot water and coffee grounds work together? But I’ve been seeing fancy brewing ratios and temp nonsense which honestly made my head spin. It’s a whole diff world out there for this stuff.

Don’t judge but I’ve read a lot of reviews lately and even asked too many strangers for reccs. And this [french press](http://dk5cnflyn7mcb.cloudfront.net/?q=GMKAO398) seems the most suitable to me. The double insulation tends to actually work which was surprising cos most insulated stuff I've bought have been total bs.

Plus the biggest thing was realizing I was spending like $6 a day on coffee without even thinking about it. And that shit adds up fast when you're hitting Starbucks every morning cos you can't function without caffeine. This one tbh makes better coffee at home and I'm not broke by the end of the month lol.

The other thing that surprised me was how much you can actually control the taste. Like you can throw in more grounds or let it sit longer if not a weak coffee person like me. Before this I was basically stuck with whatever came out of the machine (good or bad) and just had to deal with it.

I also looked at the Bodum and Secura ones. Bodum looks nice but feels kinda fragile. And the Secura one is built like a tank but your coffee gets cold fast without the insulation.

Ok I’m not saying that it's perfect or anything. But it does what I need without any weird quirks or daily maintenance drama. And tbh sometimes that's exactly what you want from something you use every single day.

Vacuum pack bags have become one of the most trusted solutions for preserving the quality of food grains, coffee, and other sensitive agricultural products. As global supply chains expand and climate challenges intensify, farmers, exporters, and processors need packaging that protects products from moisture, insects, oxygen, and contamination. [Vacuum seal bags](https://hermeticbag.rishifibc.com/organic-grain-storage-with-vacuum-seal-bags/) offer this level of safety by creating a controlled environment that keeps commodities fresh for longer periods.



At Greenpro Guard, the focus is on developing packaging that ensures product integrity, supports regulatory standards, and helps reduce post-harvest losses. Vacuum pack bags play a significant role in this mission.

**Why Vacuum Pack Bags Matter**

Improper storage is a major cause of deterioration in grains and high-value crops. Common problems include:



• Moisture absorption

• Mold development

 • Insect infestation

 • Quality loss due to oxidation

 • Unwanted odors entering the product



Vacuum pack bags solve these problems by removing oxygen and sealing the produce in a stable environment. The absence of oxygen naturally inhibits insect activity and microbial growth, which helps maintain the product’s freshness and nutritional value.

**Key Benefits of Vacuum Seal Bags**

Vacuum seal bags provide multiple advantages for farms, warehouses, exporters, and food processors:



• Long shelf life for food grains

• Protection from moisture and temperature fluctuations

 • Safe storage without chemical fumigation

 • Controlled micro-environment

 • Lower post-harvest handling losses

 • Easy storage and transportation



These features make vacuum pack bags a preferred choice for the storage of food grains in both small-scale and large-scale operations.

**Vacuum Pack Bags for Coffee Packaging**

Coffee is highly sensitive to air, humidity, and odor contamination. Even a small change in moisture can alter flavor, aroma, and density. Vacuum pack bags help solve this by sealing the beans or powder inside a protective film that blocks external elements. Many coffee manufacturers and exporters choose vacuum-based or hermetic packaging to maintain consistency until the product reaches roasters or retail shelves.

Greenpro Guard also offers [coffee packaging bags](https://hermeticbag.rishifibc.com/hermetic-bags-for-coffee-packaging-solutions/) designed to preserve the original profile of the coffee beans, ensuring a reliable shelf life during global transport.

**Role of Hermetic Technology**

Vacuum packaging works effectively alongside hermetic technology. By creating a near-zero oxygen environment, hermetic solutions act as a hermetically sealed container that protects stored materials naturally. This combination is especially beneficial for crops such as:



• Wheat

• Rice

 • Maize

 • Pulses

 • Coffee



The controlled storage environment minimizes losses and ensures that farmers and exporters maintain product value from harvest to delivery.

**Why Choose Vacuum Pack Bags from Greenpro Guard**

Greenpro Guard focuses on advanced material engineering and strict quality standards. Vacuum pack bags are manufactured using high-barrier, multi-layer films that ensure strength, durability, and resistance to puncture. Every bag goes through quality checks to ensure that storage performance remains reliable across different climates.

Users benefit from:



• Consistent protection

• Food-grade safety

 • Strong sealing capacity

 • High endurance during storage and transport

 • Support from a trusted global packaging manufacturer



[Greenpro Guard](https://hermeticbag.rishifibc.com/contact-us/) continues to innovate in protective packaging to support agriculture, food processing, and export industries.

Vacuum pack bags are a practical and effective solution for long-term storage of food grains, coffee, and other perishables. By preventing moisture, insects, and oxidation, they safeguard product quality and reduce wastage. Combined with hermetic technology, these bags provide a dependable approach for maintaining freshness from farm to market.",1,1764220283.0,u_Prestigious-Cat-7764,0,1.0,False

It happens even when I have the money and can afford it without any issues. My friends think I'm being ridiculous but I can't shake the feeling that I'm doing something wrong by spending on anything that isn't rent or groceries.

I'm looking to make my first ever woodworking project and make it 'easier' as I don't yet have equipment/space to do everything end to end yet, but I still want to learn the principles.  
  
My hopeful plan is to get help at Lowe's with cutting the wood and then do the assembly of the table and tiling, of course, myself. I'm hoping to build a rectangular open/shelf coffee table like so, which requires some thicker wood to accommodate a clean row of tiles so I don't have to cut the tiles. 

Would love any recommendations on what wood to look for as well, mounting parts, and any other advice :)

Campaigns start by mapping out coffee shops, school colors, and local landmarks so messages feel native to each block. Micro-targeted digital ads, geofenced push notifications, and QR-codes on yard signs connect offline familiarity with online reach, turning casual curiosity into contact data for future outreach. Consistent colors, fonts, and slogans reinforce identity, while storylines that mirror community hopes tap voter psychology. Professional agencies often handle sign permits, localized SEO, and finance disclosures, freeing volunteers for face-to-face work. When values align with residents’ self-image and every channel carries the same visual cues, turnout costs drop and word-of-mouth grows.\

1p7tjd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1p7tjd9/something_in_the_cornfields_took_the_woman_i_loved/,Something in the cornfields took the woman I loved.,"I’m 40 now. I have a life that, on paper, looks just fine. A small apartment in a city far from home, a job that pays the bills, a cat that ignores me unless she’s hungry. And I have a scar. It’s a thin, pale trio of lines on my left forearm that never tans and is always, always cold to the touch. It’s a permanent reminder of the night I learned that some things don’t just disappear; they get replaced.

I’m telling you this because for 24 years, I’ve told no one. I’m telling you this because a small, stupid part of me holds onto the impossible hope that she’s out there, somewhere, and she’ll read this.

Growing up in Harmon, Kansas, was like living in a shoebox with the lid on tight. The town was a flat patch of dust and faith, surrounded on all four sides by an ocean of whispering cornfields. Life revolved around two things: the harvest and the First Baptist Church of Harmon County. God wasn’t just a concept; He was a neighbor, the kind who watched you through the curtains and kept a detailed list of your every misstep.

I’d checked out of the whole religion thing by the time I was 12. I could see the hypocrisy plain as day—the same deacons who preached charity would foreclose on a struggling family’s farm, the women who led the chastity pledge group were the town’s most vicious gossips. But in a town like Harmon, “checking out” wasn’t really an option. You went to church. You bowed your head. You pretended to believe, or you became a pariah. So I played my part. I wore the floral-print dresses, I mumbled the hymns, and I counted the seconds until the sermon was over.

It was on one of those suffocating Sunday mornings that I met Amy.

I was outside the fellowship hall, trying to discreetly peel the label off my water bottle, when a plume of smoke drifted past my face. I looked up and there she was, leaning against the peeling paint of the church wall, a lit cigarette pinched between two fingers. She wore a black t-shirt for a band I’d never heard of, her jeans had holes in the knees, and her hair was a messy, dark shag that fell into her eyes. In our world of pressed slacks and pastel colors, she was an oil slick on a pristine puddle.

She caught me staring and gave me a crooked, knowing smile. “Don’t tell my mom,” she said, her voice a little gravelly. “She thinks I’m in here ‘repenting.’” She made air quotes with the fingers of her free hand.

I think I fell in love with her right then. Not in the way I understood love to be—not the chaste, church-approved hand-holding that led to a modest wedding—but in a way that felt like a secret key turning in a lock I didn’t know existed inside me. It was a terrifying, exhilarating click.

We became friends after that. In a town with only 40 kids in the entire high school, it wasn’t hard, but our friendship felt different. It was an alliance. We were two islands in a sea of beige conformity. Amy was everything I wasn’t: bold, fearless, and utterly unconcerned with what people thought of her.

The biggest problem was that I’d failed my permit test twice. My dad said I had a lead foot and the spatial awareness of a stunned squirrel, which was probably fair. This meant I was grounded, car-wise, for the foreseeable future. So Amy drove. Her car was a beat-to-hell Ford pickup that smelled like old coffee, gasoline, and her cheap cherry perfume. We called it “The Beast.”

Most of our time together was spent after dark. We’d wait until my parents’ bedroom light went out, then I’d slip out my window and she’d be there, The Beast idling quietly at the end of our long dirt driveway, her headlights off. We’d drive for hours, down endless gravel roads that cut through the black seas of corn and soy. We’d listen to her scratchy mixtapes and talk about everything and nothing—our dreams of escaping Harmon, the stupid things our teachers said, the suffocating weight of everyone’s expectations.

Those nights in The Beast were the only times I felt like I could breathe. The world opened up. Under the vast, star-dusted Kansas sky, Harmon and its church spires and its judgmental eyes felt small and a million miles away. In the dim glow of the dashboard lights, I could be myself. And so could she.

One night, parked out by the old abandoned quarry, the cicadas buzzing their deafening summer song, Amy killed the engine. The silence that followed was heavy. We just sat there for a long time, looking at the moon’s reflection on the still, black water.

“Ellie,” she said, her voice softer than usual. “Can I tell you something? Something I’ve never told anyone.”

My heart started thumping against my ribs. “Yeah. Of course.”

She took a long, shaky breath and turned to face me. Her eyes, even in the dark, were so incredibly clear. “I don’t like boys,” she said. “Not… not like I’m supposed to. I like girls.”

The air in the cab of the truck suddenly felt thin. I knew, with a certainty that was both terrifying and thrilling, what was coming next. The world narrowed to the space between us.

“I like you,” she whispered.

And then she leaned in and kissed me. It wasn’t a chaste peck. It was soft and hesitant at first, then firm, and it tasted like cherry chapstick and secrets. Every nerve in my body lit up like a switchboard. It was the most right, most natural thing I had ever felt in my life. And for a few perfect seconds, I kissed her back.

Then the teachings of Pastor Dave and a lifetime of Bible study verses crashed through my head like a battering ram. Abomination. Unnatural. A sin against God and man. A little spark of hellfire, which they’d been so careful to plant in all of us, flared up in my gut.

I’d love to tell you I was brave. I’d love to say that I didn’t harbor any of that deep-seated, internalized homophobia that our town had beat into every one of us since birth. But I can’t. The reality is, a part of me was terrified. Not of her, but of myself. Of what that kiss meant.

I pulled away, a strangled noise escaping my throat. I shoved the truck door open and stumbled out into the humid night.

“Ellie, wait,” Amy called, her voice cracked with confusion and hurt.

“I can’t,” I gasped, and I ran. I ran down the gravel road, my lungs burning, not stopping until I was home, safe in my room with the door locked.

I ignored her for the next three days. She called the house phone, and I told my mom I was busy. She left a note in my locker, and I threw it away without reading it. I saw her truck parked outside the diner and I crossed the street to avoid walking past. Each time, a fresh wave of shame and guilt washed over me. I wanted to see her, to explain, but the fear was stronger. The little preacher in my head was screaming too loud.

On the fourth day, Amy disappeared.

It started as a rumor at school, then a frantic phone call from her mother to mine. By evening, Sheriff Miller’s car was parked in her driveway. Amy hadn’t come home. Her truck, The Beast, was gone. No one had seen or heard from her.

I immediately assumed the worst, and my stomach twisted into a knot of pure ice. My mind reeled with two equally horrific possibilities. One: Someone had seen us at the quarry. Someone had found out she was gay, and in a town like Harmon, that was a dangerous secret to have. Maybe some boys from the football team had decided to “teach her a lesson.” Two: She had run away. Because of me. Because I had rejected her and made her feel like a freak. The thought that my last action toward her was one of cowardice and cruelty made me so sick I couldn’t eat.

The town buzzed. Search parties were organized. Fliers with Amy’s smiling, black-and-white school picture were tacked to the bulletin boards at the post office and the grocery store. Days bled into a week. The hope in people’s voices started to fray.

The next Sunday, the church was packed. People came seeking comfort, answers. Pastor Dave stood at the pulpit, his face grave. He spoke of the prodigal son, of lost sheep. And then his tone shifted. It hardened.

“Sometimes,” he boomed, his voice echoing off the vaulted ceiling, “our children stray from the path. They are tempted by the dark and sinful whispers of the world. And sometimes, God, in his infinite and terrible wisdom, must make an example. His judgment is swift. We must pray for Amy’s soul, that she might find repentance, wherever she may be.”

He didn’t say the words, but everyone knew what he meant. He was calling her a sinner. He was framing her disappearance not as a tragedy, but as a righteous punishment. He was saying she deserved it.

Something in me snapped. The years of forced smiles and quiet obedience evaporated in a blaze of pure rage. I stood up, my chair scraping loudly against the floor. Every head turned to me. My mom grabbed my arm, her face a mask of horror. I shook her off.

“You’re wrong,” I said, my voice shaking but loud enough for the first few pews to hear. “You’re all wrong.”

And I stormed out, slamming the heavy oak doors behind me. The gasp from the congregation was the last thing I heard before I was out in the blinding Kansas sun. I had never felt so alone, or so certain I was right.

That night, I was in my room, staring out at the fields, when I heard it. A small tink against the glass of my window.

My blood ran cold. I crept closer, my heart pounding a frantic rhythm against my ribs. Another tink, louder this time. I peered through a gap in the curtains.

And I saw her.

Standing at the edge of my lawn, where the neatly cut grass met the wild tangle of the treeline, was Amy. The breath I didn’t realize I was holding came out in a ragged sob of relief. It was a physical thing, like a lead weight being lifted from my chest. She was okay. She hadn’t been killed. She hadn’t run away forever. She had come back.

I threw the window open, leaning out into the cool night air. “Amy! Oh my god, where have you been? Are you okay? Everyone’s been looking for you!”

She just smiled, a wide, lazy smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “I’m fine, Ellie,” she said. Her voice was right, but… flat. Like a recording. “Come on out. I want to show you something.”

She gestured with her head toward the dark woods behind her. A sick feeling, a cold, oily dread, began to curdle in my stomach, overriding my relief. Something was wrong.

“Amy, what’s going on? Where is your truck?” I asked, stalling.

“Doesn’t matter. Just come with me. It’s in the forest. It’s beautiful.” Her smile stayed fixed in place, an expression plastered on her face.

That’s when I started to notice the small things. The details that were just… off. Amy was a fidgeter. She was always pushing her hair out of her eyes, or tapping her foot, or worrying the hem of her sleeve. This girl stood perfectly, unnaturally still. The moonlight caught her face, and her eyes seemed too wide, too dark, and they weren’t blinking. Not once. And her clothes… she was wearing the same black t-shirt and jeans she’d had on the night I ran from her. They looked pristine, not like she’d been living in them for a week. There wasn’t a speck of dirt on them.

I knew. In that instant, with a gut-deep, animal certainty that defied all logic, I knew that the thing standing on my lawn was not Amy. The real Amy was gone. And this thing was wearing her like a suit.

“I… I can’t,” I stammered, my voice barely a whisper. “My parents will hear me.”

The smile on its face didn’t falter, but an edge crept into its voice. That flat, recorded tone now had a sharp undertone of impatience. “They’re asleep, Ellie. I’ve been watching. They won’t wake up. Come on. I missed you.”

It replayed her voice, but the words felt hollow, a cheap imitation. I started to back away from the window, my hands trembling.

“Don’t you want to come with me?” it coaxed, taking a step forward, out of the shadows. “We can go for a drive. Just like we used to.”

As it moved into a patch of light from my bedroom window, I saw something else. Around its neck was the tiny, silver cross necklace Amy always wore, a gift from her grandmother. But it was hanging upside down.

My mind was screaming. A silent, frantic litany of No, no, no, not real, not Amy.

“I’m not coming out,” I said, trying to make my voice firm.

The smile on its face finally dropped. It vanished completely, leaving behind a blank, slack-jawed expression. The head tilted at an angle that was too sharp, too fast. An angle that would have made a human neck pop.

“Yes. You are.” The voice was no longer Amy’s. It was a layered, distorted chorus of clicks and whispers that was somehow shaped into words.

It moved with impossible speed. One moment it was on the lawn, the next it was scrambling up the side of my house, fingers and toes finding purchase in the siding like some obscene insect. It was at my window in a second, its face pressed against the screen. The eyes were black, pupilless pits. It smelled of damp soil and something rotten, like meat left in the sun.

I screamed and slammed the window shut, fumbling with the lock just as it began to claw at the screen, tearing through the mesh with long, pale fingers. It looked like Amy, but it was all wrong. Its limbs were too long, its joints bent at slightly the wrong places.

Then it started to speak again, and this is the part that haunts me more than any other. It wasn’t the chorus of whispers anymore. It was my own voice.

It was my voice, panicked and breathless, from the night by the quarry.

“I can’t,” it mimicked, my own terrified sob perfectly reproduced. “This is wrong.”

I scrambled back, falling over my desk chair and landing hard on the floor. My heart felt like it was going to explode.

The thing ripped the screen away and began to pound on the glass. “Disgusting,” it snarled, again in my voice, using the word I’d thought but never dared say aloud. It was playing back my own deepest shame, my own bigotry, and using it as a weapon.

The glass spiderwebbed with cracks. With a final, sickening crunch, the pane shattered inward. The thing dropped into my room, landing in a low crouch that a person shouldn't be able to hold. As I crab-walked backward, desperate to get away, it lunged.

Its arm shot out, impossibly long. I threw myself sideways, but its fingers, hard and sharp as bits of bone, raked across my forearm. A searing, cold pain shot up my arm, so intense it was dizzying. It didn't feel like a cut; it felt like being branded with ice.

A fresh scream tore from my throat, one of both pain and terror, and it propelled me to my feet. I fled my room, slammed my bedroom door, and sprinted down the hall to the front of the house. I could hear it behind me, a wet thud against the door, then silence. Its footsteps were unnaturally quiet, but I could feel its presence chasing me, a wave of cold air at my back.

I reached the front door, my fingers slipping on the deadbolt. I finally got the lock to turn and threw the door open, stumbling out onto the porch. My plan was to run to the nearest neighbor, a quarter-mile down the road. But as I turned, I saw it.

It stood in the doorway of my house, half-in, half-out of the shadows. But it wasn’t crossing the threshold. It just stood there, one foot on the welcome mat, a look of… confusion on its wrong-Amy face. It was as if there was an invisible barrier it couldn’t pass.

It looked at me, and its jaw unhinged, opening far too wide, and it let out a screech. A sound that wasn't human or animal. It was a high-frequency, grating noise that felt like it was tearing at the inside of my skull.

Then, as if giving up, it backed away from the door. It turned its gaze toward the woods from whence it came, and it slunk back into the yard. Its movements were what truly broke my mind. It moved backwards, its limbs contorting, the spine seeming to ripple and bend at impossible angles. It dropped to all fours, its body folding in on itself like a collapsing spider, and scuttled with terrifying speed into the treeline, disappearing into the absolute dark.

I stood on that porch until the sun came up, shaking so hard I thought my teeth would crack. I looked down at my arm. Three parallel gashes wept thin, dark blood. The skin around them was already pale and puckered, as if touched by frost.

I cried that night. I cried until I had nothing left. I wasn’t crying because I almost died. I was crying because in that moment, I knew with a bone-deep finality that the only girl I had ever loved was gone forever.

I don’t know what happened to the real Amy. Maybe that thing got her out on a dark road. Maybe those boys from town did get to her. Maybe she just ran away to escape the suffocating hate of Harmon and me, and the thing that came to my window was just a terrible coincidence. I will never know. And that, I’ve learned, is the worst part. The not knowing is a wound that never, ever scabs over.

I moved away from Harmon the day I turned 18 and I have never been back. My life is quiet now. It’s safe. Even now, as I type this, my fingers trace the three pale lines on my arm. They didn't heal right. They are a permanent part of me, a physical map of my grief and my terror. They're the one piece of evidence that tells me I didn't imagine it all.

So I’m writing this down. All of it. Putting it out into the void of the internet. I know the odds are a trillion to one. But I have to try.

Amy, if you’re out there. If you ran away and built a new life for yourself somewhere you could finally breathe… I’m so sorry. I was a coward. And I have never, not for one single day, stopped thinking about you.

Hey hey two hot takes fam! Long time listener, first time poster. I love this community and the advice is always stellar so I’m hoping yall will be able to help me.

My partner (m23) and I (nb25) are HUGE swifties. We own every vinyl, (almost) all of the cardigans, have her on almost all of our playlists (what can I say, she really does have a song to fit all my vibes), and I even went to the eras tour. Recently, my partners brother (m22) fell on hard times.

We moved away about 6 months ago and are renting a (very small) 2 bedroom house 12 hours away. About 4 months ago, my partners brother was kicked out of their family home by their mom (long story but she’s a real piece of work) and moved in with his partner. That.. didn’t work out so well either. It was a rural area, decently far from the family, and he wasn’t able to find a job after almost 2 months. He missed his car payments, lost his car, and then also got kicked out of there. We’ve all been friends for years so we offered him our extra room and to help him get off his feet a little bit. He’s been here for about 3 weeks now, has found decent employment, and has been a good help around the house. When he moved up here, we knew it would be a drain on our resources (he had $0 to his name) and a huge adjustment for us but didn’t anticipate any huge issues.

Now everything is coming to a head. With Taylor Swifts new album coming out, he’s really amped up his hatred for her. We can’t listen to her in the car, watch any interviews/tiktoks/etc in the living room containing her, play any of our vinyls, or talk about her (to each other) without him blowing up. I totally get she’s not for everyone and respect that! I have friends and family who don’t like her music at all and it doesn’t bother me.

But my brother in law HATES her, imo an unreasonable amount for a person you’ve never met. I feel like I’m not allowed to even exist in my own home without inciting an argument. On the rare occasion I do play a handful of Taylor Swift songs, he makes it a miserable experience between slamming doors, stomping around, and making nasty comments. He’s even interrupted my partners work (he works from home) to rant about her + send several (fake) news articles about her.

Most recently, tonight, my partner and I were cuddled up on the couch while eating dinner watching the tiktoks I’ve sent him and there were a few (3) containing her songs. His brother came down to grab food (we don’t always eat together), hung out for 5 minutes, heard 2 tiktoks with her music.. then got up, huffed and stomped, made a few comments I couldn’t catch under his breath, threw his dinner in the trash, and threw his utensils into the sink (loud enough to make me jump) and stormed upstairs. We’ve tried to talk to him about it and say that he doesn’t need to like her but he needs to respect that we do and learn to tolerate her music in the house.

We’re not asking for listening parties or anything crazy. We’ve been pretty mindful (more than I’m comfortable with) about playing her music or talking about her when he’s anywhere near. However, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to say we’d like to be able to have a glass of wine and pop an album on once a week or something after a rough week (in our house, where he’s living rent free currently.. we pay for EVERYTHING including his weed).

I’ve even tried to liken it to HIS favorite artists, pointing out that until that exact moment he never even had an idea I can’t stand them either. I’ve let him play their music, talk about them relentlessly, watch interviews, whatever and have just kept my mouth shut because I don’t see the point in ruining his joy over 10 minutes of my unhappiness. It, obviously, didn’t change anything aka why I’m posting here. The constant negativity and shitting on something I enjoy has really been getting to me. I’ve noticed I’m increasingly more irritable and on edge, I don’t even want to be around him right now. I don’t know where to go from here or how to fix it! He’s only been here for 3 weeks and I’ve already had to tell my partner his brother may need to move out at this rate. Two hot takes fam… what do I do?

Update: My BIL just moved in and HATES my favorite artist

Hey, two hot takes fam! Thank you so much for your input on my last post. With the exception of a few people, the comments were really affirming and helped me to pull my head out of my ass, man up, and face the situation more directly.

I went ahead and deleted the post, just in case. As I caught a few people I know IRL peeping it (my fault for putting everyone onto the pod).

We waited until he was in a good mood, then my partner and I sat him down and laid everything out on the table. We told him that his reactions to our music made us feel like we were walking on eggshells and being held hostage in our own home. We told him we were starting to become resentful and considering drastic measures if things didn’t change.

We made it clear that we were happy to help him, to an extent (and clarified the extent), but only if he could remain respectful. We clearly set the expectation that, in this house (OUR house), we don’t throw things, slam things, yuck anyone’s yum, or yell.

We made sure to address it all delicately but firmly. We asked if he’d felt respected in the house + if there was anything deeper going on mentally. He let us know about some personal things he was struggling with and we worked together to make a game plan going forward. So to those of you who pointed out it was likely a lot of change at once & there was probably a deeper mental health issue occurring- thank you!

He recognized and acknowledged that his reactions were inappropriate, as well as unwarranted. He apologized for his responses + disrespect, thanked us for being willing to put so much effort into making him understand how his actions were affecting us, and how mindful we’ve been about playing her music (while admitting we’ve been, objectively, overly conscious).

He agreed that the frequency we were asking for wasn’t unreasonable (45 minutes a week after a rough day over dinner without him, talks in private conversations not including him, during activities not including him like watching tiktoks on the couch as he walks by, and a song here or there when running errands for several hours). He confirmed we weren’t listening too loudly, that he wasn’t able to hear it in his room or upstairs at all, and that we should be able to sparingly listen to her music in common spaces (as we allow him to do as well).

We came to the conclusion, together, that his frustration his been building since his feed has been full of her stuff recently with the recent album (the fact that this is likely due to his interactions with her hate videos is a discussion for another time, though we did bring this up at surface level) and he’s been taking that frustration out on us.

We collectively agreed that it’s just better for him to keep his mouth shut going forward. Ultimately, there’s nothing we could say (if we ever tried) to make him like her. And on the flip side, there’s nothing he can say to make us not like her. We know how he feels, he knows how we feel, and there’s no point in beating a dead horse.

So basically, he’s been overexposing HIMSELF. It was good to hear him come to the conclusion this whole situation was 99% his own fault and tell us that we weren’t doing anything wrong.

Honestly, neither of us were expecting the level of accountability he took.

All three of us have got headphones (we gave him a pair of earbuds about a week ago) and will continue to keep them in heavy rotation for longer listening sessions of music others don’t enjoy, as we have been doing, while doing chores or whatever around the house if we’re all out in common spaces.

We’re going to continue working on turning our garage into a hang out space for the boys. He’ll be paying an agreed upon amount (under market value) for rent/utilities/groceries once he receives his first paycheck and will be covering his own expenses (weed/vapes/gas,etc) as well.

I’ve agreed to teach him budgeting and basic finance management techniques to help him get on his feet faster and take the necessary steps towards independence.

I’m planning to surprise him with a few vinyls of his own, of his favorite artists, so that he feels we’re on more equal ground (not a complaint of his, just an idea my partner and I agreed on) for Christmas (though I’ll likely give them to him early). We already have a few vinyls of artists we all enjoy.

Our lease renews in April. Until then, we’ll be having biweekly sit downs to go over concerns and will reevaluate our living situation at lease renewal, if he’s still here then, if all goes well, sooner if things don’t improve.

The mood in the house is great now! I thought there might be some tension after the discussion but it went over very well.

We ended the discussion by saying that we all loved each other, only wanted the best for the household, and that everyone deserved to feel happy & safe in the home.

We’re all sitting down now, getting ready to eat dinner together and watch a movie. So I thought I’d update you guys while I wait for my pot roast to be done.

Thanks again, yall!

#----NEW UPDATE----

**Editor's note: OOP made an appearance in the original BoRU and shared a new update**

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/s/8a9JHIZz1q): **November 20, 2025 (a bit over five weeks later)**

Hey all! Just wanted to clarify a few things and it’s too much to comment so boom, third post.

Am I a crazy swiftie? I don’t think so but maybe? Definitely don’t have a parasocial relationship with the woman, I absolutely agree there’s a lot of die hard fans that go way too hard and think just because she’s this ultra famous pop star she can do no wrong.

I don’t agree with all of her actions/opinions/etc. She’s done a lot of fucked up shit that I don’t agree with, but I still like her music and the production that went in to the eras tour was awesome to see live. I also don’t like every album in its entirety, listening to a whole album straight through is pretty rare for me.

I also don’t own like a buttload of merch or anything, there’s a few of my cardigans that are admittedly knock offs. I LOVE a cardigan, not just hers- most of my fall/winter wardrobe consists of cardigans and plain tees. Besides the cardigans I have 2 hoodies and a tee shirt of hers + one of each vinyl (I didn’t know adding an S was a hot take, thanks guys! You learn something new everyday). I’m all for the people who got it like that, spend your money however you want but personally don’t have enough money to throw a ton of it at a billionaire for a $100 jacket or anything, even if I do like some of them.

Why I like her: To those guessing, yes- I did grow up with her! Debut dropped when I was like..6-7, I think? It was the first CD I ever owned and best believe I was jumping up and down in my PJs to it regularly before school. It’s something my mom and I have bonded over (she took me to the eras tour), my partner and I have bonded over (believe it or not he listens to her more than I do), and in general- I’ve had a pretty good experience with her fan base. So I guess there’s a nostalgia factor there but I also just.. like it. Couldn’t tell ya why, the same way I couldn’t explain why my favorite color is my favorite color. Some of it is too poppy for me, too dramatic, too focused on men, too repetitive. I fully admit not everyone song is worthy of the hype it receives (and debatably isn’t good) but it’s fun to listen.

Am I listening obsessively? I don’t want to play her music everyday or anything. But I did absolutely want to listen to and enjoy the new album without being made to feel bad. It was the first vinyl I was able to buy at release instead of collect later, there were a lot of tik tok trends that came with the drop that I thought were funny, and I enjoyed the build up with her appearing on Kelce’s pod.

The frequency my BIL had to endure: Over 3 weeks- 1 full listen through of the new album About 10 additional songs 5-6 tik toks shared (not to BIL) Roughly 3 15/20minute conversations (2 about the new album/pod/merch with my partner, 1 about the new album/reminiscing on the tour with my mom)

Amounting to: roughly 128 minutes total so about 6 minutes a day (assuming each song is 4 minutes, each TikTok is 30seconds, every conversation was a full 20 minutes + the 45 minute album) I’m not sure where everyone is getting that I want to talk about her 45 minutes a day.

The solution/responding to some opinions: Was my BIL playing me? Maybe. But he’s been great since so I’m optimistic.

Was I too tolerant? For sure. None of the shit that was happening in my house (door slamming, throwing stuff around, interrupting my partners work) should’ve been happening.

Was it dumb to make a post? Probably. To the people pointing out it’s free material for the pod: absolutely it is. That doesn’t bother me though. I don’t spend A TON of time on the internet so Im sure there was a better place to post but I hate the hard core comments I see on other subs + I like the pod.

Was he actually subjecting himself to her or was it our wifi? Could’ve been both! His Google searches were crazy. He totally went down the rabbit hole all on his own at least a decent amount of the time. I saw/heard a lot of conspiracy theories (did yall know she’s literally the devil reincarnated?). But I’ve also been victim to recommendations I’m not into that other people I live with are, so it’s a toss up and we’ll probably never know which possibility was having the highest impact.

Did I actually have people IRL reading the post? Yeah. Like I said, I’ve put pretty much everyone I talk to onto the pod. My friends and I regularly find the craziest stories we can on Reddit to share with each other, a lot of them originating from the pods sub. So of course, my post got sent to me a few times with a “this u?”

Was I a pushover? At first, yeah. The thought of losing a relationship that I’ve been building for so long with my BIL was terrifying to me. Before he’d moved in, he was my rock. He’s helped me pack and move twice, helped me get dressed during flair ups when I couldn’t myself, proof read every nervous text I’ve sent for years, backed me up when there was family drama (even when it cost him family), babysat my pets without complaint last minute when I’ve needed to travel. He’s always been there.

This behavior was completely out of character for him and a total shock to me. It wasn’t acceptable behavior in the slightest but I’ve never been in that position before and certainly not with him.

Am I helping too much? Who’s to say. As long as he’s treating me well, I’m happy to help. I don’t mind teaching financing or budgeting, I agree he should know those skills by now but I don’t fault him for not, I know the way that he grew up. If no one ever takes the time to show you a good example or explain.. how else do you learn? Too often people continue down a bad road, simply for lack of knowledge and because it’s what feels familiar to them.

People have lost the idea of community. You’ve gotta be there for people, yall. Putting people on their ass over dumb shit/drama (yes, I agree that’s what it is aka part of the reason I was so baffled and lost) is an awful go to. Not being willing to teach people skills they clearly don’t know, just because they SHOULD know, because it asks extra work of you isn’t how you show up for people you love. Keeping score all the time is how you destroy the possibility of a good thing. I’d rather be taken advantage of for my niceness 1,000x over than let the world turn me cold.

Should I have been fronting everything? No. But again, as long as he’s being respectful- I don’t mind. It’s a bit much and for sure a drain on my resources but I’d want someone to do the same for me. I could’ve only covered the bare minimum and put a roof over his head + food in his mouth, but what kind of life is that? I could die tomorrow and take nothing to the grave. I didn’t have to dip into my savings, the sacrifice was a handful of less date nights and excursions, “fun money” for less than 2 months. Not a big deal to me until you add in the other things that were going on.

Am I still covering things? No! He’s paid us rent, he’s covering his own extra wants, and has treated us to breakfast/coffee/dinner/weed since getting somewhat more back on his feet.

Are biweekly sit downs too much? Probably. I’m admittedly type A af. We’re not just bitching at eachother the whole time or anything though. We go over events happening soon (concerts, date night plans, new restaurants opening, seasonal markets), bills, groceries (planning meals we want to cook together, ingredients, household needs), how we want to decorate the house (for holidays and stuff), and anything else on our mind (sometimes that does mean we bitch at each other).

It’s just a safe place for us to sit down and talk. We all work conflicting schedules, have our own lives, and want to make sure we’re intentionally setting aside time to talk about whatever we need to.

Was listening to his feelings before setting down boundaries us pandering to him? I don’t think so. If it had been a pattern of his, maybe. Some people are just assholes. For him, it was relevant though. Knowing he was in a mental health crisis and scared to ask for help colors the situation. It doesn’t mean anything he was doing is okay or excusable, however- if we hadn’t known what was going on and gotten him help, we never would’ve been getting the full picture. His ‘why’ isn’t an excuse but it is an explanation.

Thank you all for your input! I’ve read some nice comments and mean comments. I’ve read A LOT of comments misgendering me (come on, guys). I’ve read helpful comments, not so helpful comments, comments that think I’m a bitch, and comments calling me an angel. All of it’s been helpful, even if it’s been hard to heard at times.

**Relevant / Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Dude is 22 years old and was literally acting worse than a 5 year old over music. The background of his emotional health that you didn't know about him didn't and doesn't matter IMO, acting like a toddler for 3 weeks while living with you and making your home (and even your car rides with him) hostile was never okay but it's good you addressed it finally. He needs therapy for sure, you're good family to him (too good, I would've read anyone the riot act on this behavior way earlier) and hopefully he appreciates what you and your partner are doing for him and teaching him. Just don't bite off more than you can chew, if you want a little more advice.

You also don't owe overly long explanations to strangers on the internet btw, hope it works out for y'all

> **OOP:** I agree he was acting like a 5 year old, it was honestly a little (more than a little) ridiculous. I’d like to agree with you that his background mental/emotional health doesn’t matter. But honestly, if I was in a crisis and genuinely believed a musician my family loved was the devil, I’m not sure how I would react. I’d like to say I would never behave in the way he behaved but your brain in a psychosis (or bordering psychosis) is a crazy thing. I appreciate the advice! I’m making sure I’m taking care of myself at the same time, holding firm to the boundaries I’ve laid down, and making sure not to overextend myself to help. I know I don’t owe anyone an explanation but I wanted to reply! Y’all have been so helpful and I truly appreciate the different perspectives I’ve gotten to read ❤️.

**Commenter 2:** Damn this was a whole dissertation but honestly respect for breaking it all down like that. The math on 6 minutes a day being too much Taylor Swift is sending me lmao. Glad your BIL got his shit together and you're not bankrolling his whole existence anymore - sounds like you found a good balance between helping family and not being a doormat

Small habits every day can improve your teeth's strength, your gums' health, and your smile's brightness. If you want to update your routine or make easy changes, these useful tips will help you keep great oral health throughout the year.

# 1. Clean Your Teeth Well When You Wake Up

Brushing when you first wake up gets rid of plaque that built up overnight and makes your breath fresh. Use toothpaste with fluoride and make sure you brush every part of your mouth. Don't rush—if you brush too fast, you might miss plaque near your gums and between your back teeth.

# 2. You Must Floss

Even the best toothbrush can't clean between teeth. Flossing every day helps stop swollen gums breath, and tartar buildup. If you struggle with regular floss, try small brushes that fit between teeth or water flossers to make it easier.

# 3. Eat Foods That Keep Your Mouth Healthy

The food you eat impacts your teeth as much as how well you brush. Cut back on sugary foods and drinks, which feed the bacteria that cause cavities. Eat more crunchy fruits and veggies with your meals—they help clean your teeth while giving your gums the nutrients they need to stay healthy.

# 4. Rinse with Water After Meals

A quick rinse with water helps to clean food bits and balance acids after you drink coffee, juice, or eat sweets. This fast habit cuts down on enamel wear and keeps your mouth clean all day.

# 5. Drink More Water

Drinking plenty of water helps you make more saliva, which protects your teeth. Saliva cleans your mouth on its own, lowers acid levels, and fights off bad bacteria. Having a water bottle with you makes it easier to stay hydrated.

# 6. Get a New Toothbrush Often

Old worn bristles don't clean plaque as well. Swap out your toothbrush or electric brush head every three months, or earlier if the bristles start to spread out. This way, you'll always brush with the best cleaning power.

# 7. Go to Regular Dental Checkups

Professional cleanings and exams are key to preventing dental problems. Regular visits help catch early signs of tooth decay, gum issues, and alignment problems. To get reliable oral care and expert advice going to a [dental practice in Aldershot](https://northlanedentalpractice.co.uk/) makes sure your teeth get consistent top-notch attention.

# Good Habits Lead to a Healthy Smile

Good dental health relies on easy steady habits. By brushing and flossing each day, watching what you eat, and seeing the dentist often, you can keep your smile bright and feel confident for a long time.",1,1764219466.0,u_northlanedental,0,1.0,False

1p7tb5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarnivalCruiseFans/comments/1p7tb5a/carnival_jubilee_112025_review/,Carnival Jubilee 11/2025 Review,"I wanted to take some time to speak upon my experience so far after 5 days into a 7 day Cruise on the Carnival Jubilee. 

Parking- We chose the express lot, with traffic plan to 30-40 minutes early to have time to drop off your luggage, then park and walk about 5-10 minutes. This is the stressful part, so hang tight and ask questions. Baggage drop off was 23rd I believe and then you go to 33rd St. to park, then walk. 

Leaving is stressful, lots of people in a small place waiting around the line area for their family or friends to park their car and return so they can enter the line. Bring the best attitude you have for day 1. 

Boarding- This is easy, but also stressful as people stand around lost once entering the ship. Go to the stairs and go to Deck 16, no, don’t wait for the elevators, they take….Forever! Deck 16 provides a whole new abundance of stress with the crowds and limited tables.  This part made me rethink why I didn’t book an all inclusive resort in Mexico instead. Around 1:30 pm, go to your room and half the bags will be there, the other half strangle up to 7-8pm. Don’t put soda cans in your check bags, the ones you drop off for the crew. Those have to be carried in hand or they will confiscate them and leave a note in your bag. 

Everything happens on Deck 6,7,& 8. Deck 9 would be a great place to choose your room. 

Dinner will come next, which everyone was lost when trying to figure this part out. You don’t have a set table or time on the Jubilee, you have to make a reservation through the app, but you can’t reserve a time. Reservations start at 5 or 5:30 depending on the day, once your table is ready, you have 10 minutes to get your family together, or you lose your table. Ridiculous process that I did not enjoy while traveling with a family of 9. I want a set table and a set time.  Your wait can be 5 minutes if it’s reserved early or 20-90 minutes if scheduled 30 minutes after they open, depends on your party size. Pay attention to the menu, the higher end dinner choices now cost an extra $25, with tip $29.20. Dinner will take 60-90 minutes. Be patient and enjoy the people you choose to cruise with. 

After a day, you start to realize there’s a ton of stuff to pay for now and it’s not all free anymore. It’s more like the Jubifee.  

Elevators- These are horrible. Always full, but they stop on every floor anyways. They’re too small and there’s not enough. 

Javablue Deck 6- This is your coffee spot. The line goes quick. Deck 8 also serves coffee at the bar, but there’s no line and people will cut you non stop by walking up to the bar and ordering before you. Not worth it on deck 8. 

Coastal Slice on deck 8 is great, but there are pizzas that’s cost $6. Korean BBQ and something else I can’t remember. The white “Magic” pizza was great, it’s like a garlic sauce with cheese and it’s part of the free options along with Cheese and Pepperoni. 

Donuts on deck 16 are 2 for $4 or 5 for $8. They’re gross and hard. 

Pig & Anchor Deck 8- It’s decent, nothing special. Lots of searing, but limited seating for the big screen to watch the footballs games. About 20 nice chairs. In my opinion, the games should be available in the theatre when it’s not in use. 

Cucina del Capitano Deck 8- My favorite, I would eat here every night if it was free. The first visit is free, then it’s $8 per person plus a mandatory tip, which I’m fine with tipping and usually do $20 for each dinner. 

Lido Deck 16- Your buffet place, it’s not 24/7, it’s not even all day. Always check the hours before walking several sets of stairs just to be disappointed. 

Gelato Deck 16- Constantly closed, but it’s the best ice cream on the ship. 

Avoid the Bingo & Deal or No Deal packages. It’s a huge money grab with the largest prize at 1K. I bet they collect $10K-$15k in tickets. Deal or No Deal is still fun to go to, I would just avoid paying for the play along cards. I bet they collected 10K and gave out $200 to four play along guest. This goes along with the Jubifee theme that my 11 year old came up with. 

Unlimited Bubbles package- I regret buying this for my kids. The free lemonade was great and had pulp. This ship lacks the locations to cash in on your sodas and if you drink a small 8-10 pounce cup or whatever it is, you can’t get another immediately. You have to wait 5-10 minutes. 

Unlimited Alcoholic Drinks AKA Cheers!- This is worth it if you’re going to drink 8-10 or more drinks per day. There’s a 10 minute wait in between drinks here too. 

A large mocha is $5.50, RedBulls were $5.25, beers were around $5-7.  I was hoping that servers would walk around with beers or specialty drinks or provide sit down table service at Center Stage. 

Arcade is small, $60 lasted on average 15 minutes.  I wish it was an unlimited play for one hour for around $40. 

Center Stage is where the nightly shows happen and they are excellent, 10/10 for the shows. 

Family feud in the theatre was also 10/10. 

Andy, the Director was also 10/10. Whatever he makes, give him a raise. 

General people- Slightly better than Walmart is as far as I go here. 

Overall- I wouldn’t go again, too crowded if full. 6/10 would be my overall score based on the food availability, constant money grabs, elevators, and comfort. 

I’ll include more details once I return.

Admittedly, I do not have much experience in the coffee business exportation/processing but I’m learning as much as I can. I plan to do a work away at a coffee farm. Right now I am focused on Columbia and Peru as target countries but I am open. I would greatly appreciate any suggestions, connections, financials for a business plan, etc etc etc  

Additionally, I’ve debated having the roasting in the origin country. I know this provides issues with getting the coffee to the consumer in a timely fashion but it brings more work/money to the origin country which is my main goal. ",5,1764218854.0,Entrepreneur,10,1.0,False

Here’s mine:

I was a 22 year old dude in Ethiopia for a day layover in Addis Ababa as I was heading to Cape Town two years ago. I remember wanting to go out at night since I wanted to make use of the short time I had in Addis Ababa and felt like getting some coffee beans since coffee is popular in Ethiopia. While I was walking, I remember a local dude coming up to me asking if I needed any help and I just said I was getting some coffee beans. The dude then guided me to the outlet I was looking for as I went ahead and bought coffee beans. He then encouraged me to visit some coffee place that he knows of and since I was bored that time, I pretty much said sure why not. I then went to the place where there were a few other people including two ladies who if I am remembering correctly were apparently dancers studying culture at a university. I was served a cup of coffee and then sooner than I knew it, the dude encouraged me to buy a bottle of alcohol for the whole group saying that it would be fine and my stupid self that time simply just nodded since I wasn’t exactly thinking that time. Of course it was the good old clip joint scam and my credit card by the time I left ended up being charged $750. I remember that day being up for most of the night dealing with it because I had to try and get the local police involved and even made a Reddit post on this very fine subreddit where I was rather frantic that time (https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/13tmq8q/just_a_reminder_to_be_vigilant_about_scams/)

In hindsight, this experience made me way more vigilant that ended up helping me when I was was flying to India two weeks later where I found some of the scams there more elaborate and of course, I learned to avoid it. 

But reflecting on it, I feel bad not because I had to deal with that necessarily but because of the fact that my only experience with Ethiopia was pretty much just dealing with that especially being a rather panicked/frantic dude that time. Sure I might have lost some money but it was something I could easily get back especially with my current career. But I just feel rather sad that my experience of Ethiopia was because I was a really naive and stupid 22 year old that time. I can’t help but think about how much I’d like to visit Ethiopia again to set a new experience where I could visit Lalibela (probably not now of course considering the ethnic conflict going around in that area).

In the end though, It’s shaped how I approached my travels afterwards and having visited 40 countries already, I think about the countries that I’d like to revisit in order to have another new experience.

1p7t5qn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amenorrhearecovery/comments/1p7t5qn/5_months_check_in/,5 months check in!,"Hi everyone!! It’s been about a month since I’ve posted in here, and I wanted to give an update/kind of more formally introduce myself because this community has grown so much and I love chatting with all of you hot babes amidst similar situations and struggles.😘🥰 I almost 5 full months of starting my recovery journey, with my last reported cycle being in October 2024. July 2025 I finally committed to working with a registered dietician (who I !!ADORE!! btw, she is from Nourish and honestly saved my life). I started at my absolute lowest weight, and had a BMI of about 14.5. I honestly did not start all-in though, and I didn’t until about the beginning of September when an injury threw me into full submission. Things have been all over the place for me- long weeks and days of bingeing and dealing with the extreme discomfort of the inevitable weight and fat gain. I think this is because a lot of my diagnosis is not only the physical act of an eating disorder, but also because I was working 2 jobs- one of them being my DREAM because I finally became professional in my sport, and the other I was thrusted into a position of being head of department that I was most definitely not fit or properly trained for. I also faced a devastating loss in my life during February 2025. To say the least, it has been one of the most dramatic years of my life, especially going from such unbelievable highs to such messy lows. With that being said, I am so proud of myself and I don’t regret any second of choosing to recover. 

Currently, I am still gaining, even at a healthy BMI and weight, because I have yet to see much progress in my proximity to my cycle returning. However, for the very first time this morning I saw the tiniest bit of EWCM, which is refueling my hope and manifestations that this messiness is a reflection of the sincere fragility and sensitive attendance of my endocrine system. I feel like the past 2 weeks for me have been the most consistent with an “all in” approach. I eat anywhere from 2500-5000 calories from a mix of chocolate, popcorn, salmon & avocado bagels, and poke. Actually, last night I had almost a full pound of Sprouts bulk Chocolate Cold Brew Coffee Bites (they were on sale). I have also added and taken away exercise throughout this whole process, but most recently I have been going to the gym just to stretch for 30-45 minutes and then 1-2x a week attending a 50 min reformer Pilates class that my gym offers. I have every desire to return back to formal strength and cardio regimen, especially as the audition process for my sport is quickly approaching and the window of time for my 3-month cycle maintenance to be able to return is fleeting. I have also, very gratefully, kept my office job but am now working in a different department that I am thriving in and really enjoying. I was also diagnosed with OCD, and finally officially with ADHD as well. This has been extremely impactful on my journey because it has validated my struggles and I am able to seek support without shame or guilt. Other than that, I am due for a 3-month lab test in the beginning of December, which is lowkey exciting now. I just can’t believe how far along in this process I am, because it is making me realize all the more that I was nowhere near ready for a recovery return that I had all my fingers crossed for back in September.

I am sorry for the long post, however I am hoping that at least one of you beautiful angels resonated with any of it, or found hope for you to begin your own journey. Please be so kind to yourself, that is one of the things we need most in order to heal. HA is extremely personal and contains a multitude of nuance and niches that takes time to figure out. I am still holding onto those feelings that I had in July/August once I started eating more and became less afraid of nutrient dense foods- the world became so much brighter and my fractured perception of things softened. I hope that to the reader that got this far (and of course still to those who don’t), that your journey is blessed and that you understand how worthy you are of your own commitment to this scary and unpredictable process. 😊💐🫂",1,1764218463.0,Amenorrhearecovery,0,1.0,False

I’m excited about the independence, but I’m a bit worried about how I’m going to furnish the place. I’ve got about £600 saved, and that has to cover everything, couch, bed, table, chairs, the works. I went to a few furniture stores just to get ideas, and I left feeling defeated. A decent couch alone basically costs more than an arm and leg combined now. How is anyone supposed to afford this?

I’ve been scouring budget options online and found a few bundled cheap living room sets, couch, coffee table, side tables, for under £400. Reviews are mixed, but at least it’s something. I can’t exactly invite people over and ask them to sit on the floor. My parents have offered some furniture that they don’t use anymore, and while it might not be much it’s something off my list. A friend suggested checking Facebook Marketplace, but the idea of buying a used couch grosses me out a bit. I don’t know where it’s been or what’s happened on it. I even looked at suppliers on Alibaba to see if buying direct would be cheaper, some of the prices looked promising, but most of them require bulk orders or long shipping times. Not super practical when you need a bed next week.

I have female friends my age who have tried to set me up with their cousins and friends, but I was stood up on multiple occasions. (still god bless them for trying for me haha).

However I've noticed a shift. Lately women in their late 30s and early 40s have been soliciting me for dates. At first I was somewhat apprehensive, but with a little time getting to know them outside the usual groups over drinks and coffee, I've found them quite charming, and excellent conversationalists. One of which 39F, has caught my attention recently after inviting me to the beach this weekend as a date. 

My friends have suggested going back to dating apps, but I refuse to return to the endless swiping and ghosting. So, what do you think? Any advice and constructive responses are appreciated.

My eating window is 5pm to 6pm and I love the simplicity of it. No thinking about food prep, no multiple meals, just one solid dinner.

But those hours leading up to my meal were honestly torture for the first two months. Like hour 18 to 22 I was just watching the clock, couldn't focus on anything, constantly thinking about what I was gonna eat. The physical hunger wasn't even the worst part, it was the mental obsession.

I tried everything this sub suggested. Black coffee made me jittery and also I’m kind of trying to cut back on caffeine a bit. Sparkling water was okay but not great. Staying busy only worked if I was doing something super engaging, otherwise my brain just kept drifting back to food. What finally made the difference was a fiber drink mix that's under 5 calories so technically doesn't break the fast, and it actually keeps me full enough that I'm not suffering through those last few hours. Now I can actually enjoy my evening instead of just enduring it until my eating window. The hunger is still there but it's manageable, like a 4.5 out of 10 instead of an 8. Makes omad feel sustainable long term instead of something I'm just white knuckling through.

* **Top Spots:** Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket.

||
||
|**Category**|**Cost (Monthly)**|**Notes**|

* **Top Spots:** Kuala Lumpur (KL), Penang.

||
||

my dad made the argument that even if someone were ro eat very little (ex 500 cals a day), if the foods were unhealthy, there would still be weight gain. 

usually when people eat less and still gain weight, its because the foods are calorie dense, right? for example i could eat three large meals a day plus snacks of very calorie light foods and not gain but if i were to eat less food but a food that was very calorie dense, i could gain.

i gave him my previous example of drinking a single iced coffee from starbucks per day which he deems an unhealthy food. he claims this could still cause weight gain even if the total calories eaten that day are under the body’s maintenance. i hear this a lot. “its what you eat.” but from a scientific perspective this really never made sense to me. thermodynamics doesn’t really give a shit if i got a unit of energy from a fruit or a french fry. 

the only caveat i can think of certain components like sodium retaining more. (ex- saline when dehydrated or salt pills for people who need better retention) ",2,1764217902.0,NoStupidQuestions,15,1.0,False

made me wonder what tiny, free shows everyone else catches before the day officially starts. i used to think mornings were just for rushing, but lately i’m collecting these quiet bits: the bakery steam that smells like my grandma’s hug, the crossing guard who dances with her stop sign, the way my phone charger light looks like a tiny lighthouse when i can’t sleep.

do you have a small, repeatable moment that quietly keeps you going? i’d love to hear it, no pressure, just swapping soft inventory. also, if anyone else names the neighborhood wildlife, please tell me i’m not the only one who calls the bold squirrel ‘sir nibbles’ like he’s knighted.

anyway, thanks for letting me peek out from lurk-mode; your stories have been my pocket-sized companions on rough days. what’s one little thing you noticed today that made you feel like the universe gave you a quiet high-five?",10,1764217835.0,CasualConversation,3,1.0,False
1p7sy5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1p7sy5l/i_hate_my_mil_i_cannot_stand_to_even_see_her/,I hate my MIL I cannot stand to even see her anymore,"I need to get this off my chest before I go off on her. I am not looking for advice or a therapist (I already have one) I just need to scream this into the void because talking to her about it isn't doing me any good. Quite the opposite actually. I also don't want to go to my husband with this because his relationship with his mom is already not the best and I don't want to make things worse. He is very supportive and protective of me. I will list the reasons why I hate her. They are in no particular order but I will say that what upsets me the most is the way she treats my husband. 

1. About 8 months ago, my MIL twisted my words during a conversation and went on to announce to my husband that she was not living with him because I told her she could move in. Unfortunately her housing situation was not good so asking her to leave our house was not an option. 
2. When he has been sick or not feeling well, she does nothing for him. She doesn't ask how he is doing or if she can do anything for him. She sits around the house watching TV and waiting for him to provide her with food.
3. She doesn't celebrate any of his accomplishments. Recently, she accumulated an almost $2000 debt which he had agreed to pay for. He figured out a way to have the debt waived. When he informed her. Her answer was: “oh” then she moved on to another topic. 
4. She waits around for my husband to make food and coffee for her or she will go without. Even when he has been working all day, she will ask him: “what are we eating.”
5. She goes to the grocery store and buys large amounts of food for herself only but doesn't actually cook any of it. 
   1. My husband hates this because there is no room for any more food and large amounts of food are going to waste. 
6. He has spoken to her several times not to overfill the refrigerator because it could damage it. She says she will be more mindful then turns around and buys more food. 
7. She borrows his car all the time but never puts gas in it or lets him know that it needs gas. That is a discovery he gets to make on his way to work in the morning. 
8. He has asked her several times not to park in the driveway of the house and to turn off the lights inside the car. She constantly parks in the driveway and leaves the lights on.
9. If he ever talks to her about any of the above, she will become defensive, cry and act like the victim in the situation. 
10. She often talks about the past, how she was wronged by different people, and holds a lot of resentment towards people she believes have wronged her.
11. She has not made much progress or taken any steps to find other living arrangements.
12. We have two dogs, she often feeds them things that they are not supposed to have or leaves food on the floor that is toxic for them (grapes, banana peels…)
13. Since she moved in, she has taken over the house. She spends most of the afternoon and night watching TV in the living room and watching videos on her phone at the same time.

This list could go on forever if I included all the things she has done to me personally but if this is how she treats her only son, what can I expect for myself. Thank you for letting me rant and get this off my chest. I feel much lighter now. ",17,1764217764.0,TwoHotTakes,13,0.83,False
1p7sxeu,https://i.redd.it/93i2f3ty8q3g1.jpeg,Pretty sure a lot of 4 wheelers were calling me an idiot today…,"Headed north on 65 in AL today, just before Birmingham I realized I was going to have some serious gastrointestinal issues (Godfathers Pizza combined with coffee, I know, not smart). 

Welp, not before long it became an emergency. Had my GPS set to a Petro about 40 miles out for a 10 hr. With about 20 miles left I knew there was just no way.

To avoid shitting my pants I pulled into the nearest truck stop with a severe code brown situation. Even a minute longer would’ve resulted in a lifetime memory of shame and disgust. 

Of course, once I pulled in I was in full on survival mode. Their signage was awful and the road that led to their truck parking area looked like a little dead end dirt road. (It was at night so visibility was not great). So I took a wrong turn. 

Ended up taking a right turn onto a road meant for cars to go into a restaurant and a gas station. Realized real quick that I needed to utilize the “when in doubt back it out” rule.

Apparently this turns out to be the busiest fucking fuel station in Alabama with a constant flow of cars from either direction, front and rear, with no intention of understanding that I’m trying to back out. (With hazards on and everything). 

Cars coming forward, and from behind trying to go around me even though I’m BLOCKING THE ENTIRE FUCKING ROAD. 

Finally after being nice and pulling back up to let people through, I just block everything and proceed to do the 90 degree blindside back required to escape. 

Just forced people to back up, wait, or just u-turn and give up. Managed to finally safely back up and straighten out to get back onto the entrance for truck parking. 

What gets me is it was pretty damn obvious what was going on, and that I needed space to get out of the situation. Yet 9/10 people just tried to squeeze their way by in every which way for some greasy French fries and a shitty burger. 

Funny thing is with all of this stress my body totally forgot its situation. Immediately after I got back on track, CODE BROWN. Made it halfway down their driveway before just setting my brakes and turning on my hazards. 

Climbed up the mountain of a hill from the parking area to the toilets while narrowly avoiding shitting my pants. By the time I reached the restrooms I had fully exhausted my clenching ability. (Thankfully everything made it into the toilet). 

Either way, it was astonishing how many 4 wheelers just looked at me and probably thought “wow what a dumbass” then tried to pass me in any way that just made my situation worse. 

Pictured is the wrong turn I made and had to back out of. I later realized there that there was another driveway on the other side, but in the moment I was fighting for my damn life and was analyzing the situation with real world observations vs just re checking GPS images. 

Either way it taught me how inconsiderate and clueless 4 wheelers are. Really gave me an insight to some of these truckers out here having to do blindside or tight backs in the middle of the city while blocking traffic. Mad respect to the people doing that on a regular basis. 
 
Unfortunately, for me personally, this lesson had to occur on a more comedic note. I’m just glad I didn’t shit my pants. That is all. ",11,1764217690.0,Truckers,17,0.93,False

1p7svfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1p7svfh/the_candlestick_and_the_coffee_spoon/,The Candlestick and the Coffee Spoon,"

Evan Lee lived by the rhythm of the markets—pre-market scans with the sunrise, entries before most people finished their first cup of coffee, and a heart that beat to the jittery pulse of green and red candlesticks. He thought he liked it that way: predictable chaos, controlled by spreadsheets and risk-management rules he could recite in his sleep.

On an unusually calm Tuesday, Evan ducked into a small café near his co-working space. His latest trade was hovering stubbornly at break-even—no thrill, no panic. Just… stillness. He told himself he needed caffeine, but secretly he just needed to step away from the screen and breathe.

The café was quiet, all warm wood and soft chatter. And behind the counter stood someone he’d never seen before.

She had a messy bun, an easy smile, and a voice that wrapped around him like late-afternoon sunlight. Her name tag said **Maya**.

“What can I get started for you?” she asked.

Evan opened his mouth but no words came out—his brain was so used to numbers that suddenly speaking to an actual human felt like executing an order without checking the chart first.

“Uh—coffee,” he finally managed. “Black. No indicators needed.”

Maya raised an eyebrow, amused. “Indicators?”

“I—uh, I trade stocks,” he said, rubbing the back of his neck.

“Oh! So you’re one of those people who look very serious behind laptops at 9:30 a.m.,” she teased. “You know you all look like you’re trying to defuse a bomb, right?”

He laughed—really laughed—and something in him eased.

While she made his drink, they talked. About why she loved drawing latte art, why he never trusted airline Wi-Fi for trading, and how neither of them understood people who didn’t appreciate breakfast foods. It was surprisingly effortless.

Evan’s phone lit up—his trade had finally moved. A nice green candle. He should have rushed back, increased his stop, planned his exit.

But he didn’t.

Instead, he stayed.

“So,” Maya said, handing him his cup with a foam heart floating on top, “is this where you run back to your… candlesticks?”

He shook his head. “Actually… I think the market can wait a minute.”

Her smile widened, soft and bright. “Good. I was hoping you’d say that.”

They talked until his coffee went cold. And when he finally left, he realized something startling: for the first time in years, he felt more excitement walking away from the charts than toward them.

The next day—and every day after that—he found himself returning to the café. Not for caffeine. Not for a break from the market.

But because in a world full of volatility, he’d found something beautifully steady.

And he wasn’t about to let go.

but there is 1 big problem with it.

the connectivity is abysmal.

what do i mean by this?

imagine you connect your phone to like, a bluetooth speaker and start playing music on it, now start walking away from it and after a little bit, the audio output will start to be a bit spotty. 

understand what i mean?

that is the issue that i'm having with my phone but at a much more ridiculous scale. if there is anything, and i do mean, anything at all between my phone and my cochlear, the connection goes all spotty. this is not an exaggeration. 

i was making myself a cup of coffee and my phone was positioned behind the cup and it started to occur. can you imagine that? a coffee cup being enough to cause a spotty connection, this also happens whenever i walk over a train line overpass and whenever i walk past any stores.
