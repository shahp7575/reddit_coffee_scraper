Hey Calgary Reddit! üëã

I just made the leap from the skyscrapers of Toronto to the stunning skyline (and actual sky) of Calgary. So far, I‚Äôm loving the fresh air, chill vibes, and the insane mountain views that make the CN Tower look like a lego set.

About me:
üìç 30-ish, city guy learning to be outdoorsy
üçï Can debate Toronto vs. Calgary pizza without starting a war (maybe)
üé∂ Into music, film, hikes, and late-night deep talks over wine or coffee
üíª Work in tech / creative industry ‚Äî so yes, I can probably fix your Wi-Fi üòÑ

I'm here to meet cool people, get to know the city beyond just Stephen Ave and the Bow River path, and maybe connect with someone who's got a spare pair of hiking boots and a soft spot for sarcastic humor.

So ‚Äî what‚Äôs something every Calgarian should do at least once? Or where‚Äôs the best place to catch a sunset with a view and no crowds?

DMs are open if you're down for a city explorer turned mountain rookie üèûÔ∏è

So to start this off quick, i got out of an abusive relationship with my ex gf of about 2 years, around 3 weeks ago. i had a very anxious attatchment to her but i finally got out of the cycle by hooking up with my friend and it helped me detach greatly.

Now, i kind of butchered that FWB situation because i caught feelings. I told my friend i had to cut her off because she didn‚Äôt want to progress like i did in terms of a relationship and I was scared of getting hurt from my trauma with my ex. This happened like 3 days ago

I hit her up again yesterday to see if i could call her, she didn‚Äôt answer but called about 8 hours later but i didn‚Äôt see it. today i texted her why i wanted to talk because i feel bad, i had to ghost her for a year bc of my ex. And now I basically just said im leaving her right as we started talking again. It is selfish of me because at the end of the day, she does like me, and i am important to her life . It‚Äôs not fair to her that I can just come and go as i please. I just reacted how i would to protect myself. So i texted her that i didn‚Äôt want to do that to her again and if we could meet up for coffee so we could talk. she hasn‚Äôt answered, which i really don‚Äôt blame her at all. She has every right to not put up with me coming and going it just sucks because i don‚Äôt mean to act like this I just can‚Äôt go through what i went through again. 

So now that she‚Äôs not answering I‚Äôm just being anxious and having trouble being alone, I haven‚Äôt been single for more than a month since i was 16, i‚Äôm 23 now. and had 2 long term relationships, so as you can assume I haven‚Äôt really been alone in 6 years through my whole life of maturing. I matured with someone in my life since i was a teen so this is all scary to me. I know i need to be alone, sometimes it‚Äôs fine, but some days it really just kicks my ass. I know i need to be single but when im alone and things aren‚Äôt going my way my anxiety kicks in and i feel like i need someone to fill in that void. I know this is a lot to take in. But if anyone could give me advice on my friend, their takes on the situation. Especially how to manage being alone. It would help me greatly.

Pleaseee refrain from calling me mean names because of my friend lol. I‚Äôm already self aware that what i did is fucked up and inconsiderate. ",1,1748393634.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1kx3ujc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BooMeRx_1/comments/1kx3ujc/best_portable_bluetooth_speakers_my_picks_thoughts/,Best Portable Bluetooth Speakers (My Picks + Thoughts),"Hey Reddit,

After spending way too much time researching, watching reviews, and reading spec sheets, I decided to just dive in and **test six well-known portable Bluetooth speakers** for myself. I was looking for something that could handle day-to-day use, outdoor hangs, and maybe the occasional beach trip ‚Äî basically, a great all-around speaker that didn‚Äôt compromise too much on sound or build.

Here are the speakers I tested:

* Bose SoundLink Flex
* JBL Xtreme 2
* Marshall Middleton
* JBL PartyBox Encore
* Anker Soundcore Motion Boom Plus
* EarFun UBOOM L

If you're on the fence about any of these, I hope this post gives you some real-world insights. I used each speaker for at least 1‚Äì2 weeks in different scenarios ‚Äî indoors, outdoors, low volume, max volume, solo listening, small gatherings ‚Äî to get a balanced impression.

# [1. Bose SoundLink Flex](https://www.yourtechbuddies.com/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers/#1)

**First Impressions:**  
Compact, classy, and exactly what you'd expect from Bose in terms of build quality. It feels premium but also rugged, with a soft-touch exterior and an IP67 waterproof rating.

**Sound:**  
Extremely clean and balanced. Vocals and mids are where this speaker shines. It doesn‚Äôt overwhelm you with bass, but what‚Äôs there is tight and controlled. Great for acoustic, pop, jazz, or podcasts. Not for bass heads.

**Portability:**  
A+ here ‚Äî super lightweight, easy to toss into a bag, and even has a fabric loop for hanging.

**Battery:**  
I got around 10‚Äì11 hours at moderate volume.

**Drawbacks:**  
No stereo pairing with older SoundLinks. Also, no aux input, which is a minor annoyance.

**Verdict:**  
If you want a **small, elegant speaker with clean sound**, and don‚Äôt need wall-shaking bass, the SoundLink Flex delivers. Ideal for personal listening or quiet settings.

# [ 2. JBL Xtreme 2](https://www.yourtechbuddies.com/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers/#2)

**First Impressions:**  
This thing is a tank. It comes with a strap, and you‚Äôll want it ‚Äî it's not light. But it screams durability, and it can take a beating.

**Sound:**  
Bass-heavy, no surprise here. Dual passive radiators on the sides push out some serious low-end. It‚Äôs fun and loud, but occasionally, the mids feel a bit recessed, especially at higher volumes.

**Portability:**  
Stretching the word ‚Äúportable‚Äù here. It‚Äôs more like ‚Äútransportable.‚Äù You *can* carry it in a backpack, but it‚Äôs going to take up space and add weight.

**Battery:**  
Solid ‚Äî around 15 hours. Also charges devices via USB out.

**Drawbacks:**  
Not the most detailed sound. Definitely tuned for party volume over fidelity. No USB-C charging.

**Verdict:**  
The Xtreme 2 is a **powerhouse for outdoor use or small gatherings**. Not the best for subtle listening, but it dominates for casual bassy fun. You‚Äôll want this for picnics, not piano recitals.

# [ 3. Marshall Middleton](https://www.yourtechbuddies.com/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers/#3)

**First Impressions:**  
Arguably the best-looking speaker I tested. Has a classic amp vibe with textured finish and brass knobs. It‚Äôs got style and substance.

**Sound:**  
Surprisingly detailed and rich. Very balanced profile ‚Äî strong bass, but not boomy, crisp highs, and warm mids. Sounds great across genres, and doesn‚Äôt distort at higher volumes. Definitely the most ‚Äúaudiophile-ish‚Äù tuning of the bunch.

**Portability:**  
Mid-sized, about the size of a chunky book. A bit heavy, but not unmanageable.

**Battery:**  
20+ hours ‚Äî great endurance.

**Extras:**  
Has an app with a customizable EQ, and the physical knobs are actually usable for adjusting sound and volume.

**Drawbacks:**  
Price. It‚Äôs not cheap, and not everyone will prioritize the vintage look or brand cachet.

**Verdict:**  
If you care about **aesthetic AND great sound**, the Middleton hits a sweet spot. Pricey, but justifies it with quality across the board.

# [4. JBL PartyBox Encore](https://www.yourtechbuddies.com/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers/#4)

**First Impressions:**  
Huge. Loud. Flashy. Definitely built for events, not coffee shop corners. It even comes with a wireless mic for karaoke.

**Sound:**  
Booming and bass-heavy, with clear highs and enough volume to fill a backyard. It‚Äôs less about nuance and more about vibe. It performs best outdoors where it has room to breathe.

**Lights:**  
The LED light ring is fun, especially in low-light settings. Purely aesthetic, but it adds to the energy.

**Battery:**  
Roughly 10 hours ‚Äî fair considering the output.

**Portability:**  
Calling this ‚Äúportable‚Äù is a stretch. You *can* move it, but it‚Äôs bulky and heavy. Think rolling suitcase, not travel bag.

**Verdict:**  
If you want to throw a **mobile party**, this is a beast. Great for events, but definitely overkill for most casual users.

# [ 5. Anker Motion Boom Plus](https://www.yourtechbuddies.com/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers/#5)

**First Impressions:**  
Anker‚Äôs been killing it with budget-friendly gear, and this speaker is no exception. Feels tough, IP67 waterproof, and even floats.

**Sound:**  
Loud, punchy, and full. The bass is strong (especially for the price), and it holds up surprisingly well at higher volumes. The highs can be a little sharp out of the box, but the app lets you EQ that down easily.

**Battery:**  
20+ hours! Unreal for the price.

**Portability:**  
It‚Äôs not tiny, but has a carry strap and is still much lighter than JBL‚Äôs Xtreme or PartyBox.

**Drawbacks:**  
Slightly plasticky build. Not as refined as the Middleton or Bose, but not a dealbreaker. Default tuning is a bit aggressive.

**Verdict:**  
This is the **value king**. Loud, long-lasting, waterproof, and cheap ‚Äî what more could you want? A must-buy for budget-conscious bass lovers.

# [6. EarFun UBOOM L](https://www.yourtechbuddies.com/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers/#6)

**First Impressions:**  
Very compact, matte finish, and has a simple design. Looks clean and minimal. Definitely the most ‚Äúgrab-and-go‚Äù option here.

**Sound:**  
Surprisingly capable. You‚Äôre not getting crazy bass, but it holds its own. Vocals are clear, bass is respectable at medium volumes, and it doesn‚Äôt distort easily.

**Portability:**  
Super light, water-resistant, and easy to toss in a bag.

**Battery:**  
About 14‚Äì16 hours, which is impressive for the size.

**Drawbacks:**  
Can‚Äôt compete with the big boys in bass or fullness. But it‚Äôs not trying to.

**Verdict:**  
If you want something **cheap, light, and good enough**, the UBOOM L is awesome. Great for casual listening or travel. It‚Äôs not a party speaker, but it punches above its weight.

1kx3qzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffGridCabins/comments/1kx3qzs/offgrid_power_improvements/,Off-Grid Power Improvements,"Hey everyone,

I have a pretty common off-grid power situation but have recently been toying with the idea of improving the situation and wanted to see if anyone out there had ideas on the subject.

We (my family) have a cabin with no realistic hope of getting electricity.  We have been using gasoline generators for 40 years to generate the power we need, we're on generator #3.  However, that is obviously fairly pricey and we also have community time-of-day rules and all that good stuff.  

We run 20-25 light bulbs, a coffee pot, a toaster, a TV/DVD and a 240 Volt well pump.  I'd like to come up with a solution that would allow Star Link, which would then add potential for phones, laptops, and that kind of thing.

Question #1:  
\- I have no idea how much power we actually draw off of that generator  
\- I'd like to baseline it but don't know how???  
\- How can I measure that traffic?

I can't stop thinking about how much we are wasting, but maybe, we're not, I don't know.  That generator has 2 speeds, idle and at RPM.  This means if I power a light bulb, I'm wasting 4900 Watts - I think.  This has lead me to think about other solutions.

Solar:  
I've already priced this out, and for our electrical footprint, it's simply not cost-effective.  Plus there are several other factors such as snow depth and things like that.

Batteries:  
This lead me to think about a battery vault with a bus switch.  But I don't know how much I could run off a battery bank, how many, or what type of batteries, to get, or logistical challenges like an unattended cabin for several weeks at a time.  I like the idea of a vault, that we could dig into ground and concrete it in.

Anyway, any help here would be appreciated.  Anyone have any experience in these type of issues?  I've included a couple of very rough drawings - this seems like a pretty simple idea as just don't know if the juice is worth the squeeze.  For Star Link though, we really need a more permanent power source.",1,1748393002.0,OffGridCabins,1,1.0,False
1kx3qlo,https://www.reddit.com/r/MigratorModel/comments/1kx3qlo/a_look_at_the_issues_of_the_proposed_oumuamua/,A Look at the Issues of the proposed Oumuamua - Boyajian Star 'Signal' (Update 2025 May 28),"I think I may have noted the perihelion date for Oumuamua being the same as the Angkor dip for Tabby's star a little back, but concluded it was more likely to be coincidence. Then when I became of Hibberd's modelling of Oumuamua's trajectory, where perigee fell on the same date, I thought it intriguing enough to warrant a 'Migrator Model' academic download - but even then flagged I doubted Oumuamua would become a key part of my 'proto-hypothesis'. Then when I experimented with Hibberd's 171.2 beta angle for Oumuamua, prompted after presenting the finding Sacco's orbit appeared to be trigonometric, the findings were simply astonishing. Oumuamua is definitely a key strand of the Migrator Model now - though not quite as Avi Loeb's ETI solar sail, rather as a 'signal' vessel. The 171.2 beta angle appears to 'affirm' the sectorial blocks of the template (my proposed asteroid mining sector division) and even appears to unlock the structure of Angkor's standard dip signifier (4176) with clean routes to Earth's sidereal orbit and Sacco's orbit for Tabby's star. So first I'll lay out the proposition, and then look at some of its weak points.

**Proposition -**

We know the galaxy is very old (in a sense, on its last legs with most of the stars dying or dead). This could mean a highly advanced and stable ETI could have millions of years on us. The ETI would have its own vested interests in harvesting resources from star systems it has colonised and keep a sharp eye out for new kids on the block (Earth as a big blue dot would stick out a mile as a candidate). Now though an established species might have potentially millions of years of technological development - a newcomer like our species might still be a threat if technological progress slows down at certain thresholds (akin to the way data mining in crypto currencies takes ever longer computing time). However, just as we have nature reserves, an advanced ETI might give an emerging intelligent species time - and to see how it turns out. If the species behaves in a stable fashion as it pushes out into space, particularly when it comes to sharing resources - it will have passed the test of natural selection and the ETI will know there is a good chance of stable relations. However, if the new species is incapable of cooperating with its own disparate factions (nations) and warring over the assets of its Moon or the asteroid field - while at the same time developing ever more deadly space vessels and weaponry - the ETI might decide the risk of tolerating the equivalent of a drunken teenager in charge of an AI honed war machine, is simply too great and exercise the ultimate sanction before a given technological threshold is reached. So how would an ETI signal to us its seniority and give both a chance for 'contact' and a warning?

The core premise of the Migrator Model as that the dust dips are superfine mill tailings (dust waste) of massive industrial asteroid harvesting. The activity is in an industrial orbit safely away from the ecliptic. The secondary proposition is that the ETI are using the waste to signal - Earth in particular. This would account for the scale of some of the dips (D1520 around 22% or 44 Jupiter-class gas giants eclipsing the star simultaneously - it's not a lot of dust, it's line of sight). Positioning the asteroid platforms (already in an artificial orbit) would not require a lot of resources. However, Boyajian's star at 1470 light years away would mean the signal was set up around 550 AD. Further, to know we are a metal-working species the ETI would have had to scan us around 900 - 1000 BC. Surely the ETI could not have calculated our technological development so accurately? Well, once the 'dust-signal' is up and running, the ETI could just keep it going - concluding that at some point (maybe many centuries or even many millennia either side of a predicted timeline) - wholesale harvesting of an asteroid field could take millennia (especially if needing resources to construct a Dyson swarm).

As a 'signal ambassador', Oumuamua would not likely have travelled directly from Tabby's star. More likely launched from a mother ship just outside the Solar system - the mother ship would know the timetable of dips for Tabby's star and, its sensors detecting growing space activity, dispatch Oumuamua to be timed for the Angkor dip. In one fell swoop, the ETI flags their seniority, that they are watching us closely, grooming us for contact and laying down the law of natural selection (if you are a functional species, we'll get on; if dysfunctional, you are a threat).

Well hey, why not just send a telecommunication, or laser signal - rather than such a weird set up? This question certainly exposes the weakest part of my proposition and to be honest, I'm not sure I can counter that point very strongly. However, here goes...

We as individuals do not live more than 100 years (and much of the latter years winding down). A signal spanning 3000 years of strategic spanning (on the surface) seems absurd. But this is because we are thinking anthropomorphically - a species with advanced science might have long overcome mortality (as we understand) and have incredibly long life spans (even the equivalent of immortality). 3000 years could be a coffee break to such a species. Further, as noted, the Tabby star dust dips as a signal would not cost much resources to set up. And of course an ETI would have an 'alien intelligence' - this means its choice of medium of communication might appear bewildering.

As for telecommunications,  believe SETI looked at Tabby's star and detected nothing indicating radio communications, and even optical flashes have been searched for. The obvious answer is that the ETI moved on long ago to other technologies (who knows: quantum resonance?). However, an advanced species should be able to 'dumb down' its technology and send a radio signal. The issue there is that the signal would have to be deciphered - and that could take time or even not work. An Oumuamua flyby is unambiguous and by arranging its perigee - perihelion and angle - all that needs to be said is said.

And if all propositions correct, what are they saying:

A) We're older and been around (we have seniority -we're not messing around, listen up)

B) We're asteroid miners - you will be too (if we deem you a stable species)

C) We will be back soon (tentative forecast: 2027 based on the dip signifier for Angkor)

My dog is dying. This is his fifth bout of pancreatitis and I can‚Äôt afford to treat it anymore. It cost at least 1000 every single time he goes. It‚Äôs been five times now he‚Äôs constantly sick. I‚Äôve lost everything this year and I‚Äôm not depending on my family for help while I wait for disability. I had to pick up and move across the goddamn ocean so I can get some kind of mental health therapy and care. Everything is so hard the only help my family will give me is to put the dog down and he‚Äôs the only emotional support I have. I don‚Äôt have people I can call when things are hard. I don‚Äôt have that person who will go have a cup of coffee with me unless I can pretend I‚Äôm happy. People just come into my life to use me and then when they find other people they leave it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a friendship or a relationship my life is like a revolving door. Today he had another attack and I had to rush him to the vet. I know I have nothing left to even keep my phone on or pay my vehicle or eat this week. My family is putting pressure on me to put him down and I don‚Äôt have anything else This past year has been a let me know. I‚Äôve lost everything I‚Äôve ever known in my adult life. I had to leave somebody if I wouldn‚Äôt have left probably would‚Äôve killed me and I‚Äôm starting again. And I try so hard. I try so goddamn hard and when I finally do break it down and reach out to people I get told by these assholes that what I really need are  friends to life and have fun with. Not them of course, but other people I can lay the burden on when that‚Äôs just not my reality. I can never tell people ever anything. That‚Äôs not positive or happy or they will go even faster. I feel like I literally need therapy every single day just to have someone to talk to to stay afloat And that‚Äôs not realistic and I don‚Äôt have the independent funds to make it happen. I exhaust myself traveling hours on the train to get to meet ups or go to groups and events and try to meet people. Even when I finally do make friends or feel like I belong in a group somewhere something happens where people can expose people can see there‚Äôs something wrong with me. Even when I can ignore even when I‚Äôm on my best behavior I‚Äôm still socially so awkward . I do stupid things like everybody goes on a hike and I get lost so they just leave without me. Like I can‚Äôt hide the learning disabilities. I can‚Äôt hide that I want to Spectrum even when I can hide the mental illness I can‚Äôt hide people never even stay long enough to see that I‚Äôm crazy because I‚Äôm already so fucking on in general, I can‚Äôt support myself. I can‚Äôt earn a
Living . The best I can out for is to get approved for this PIP so I can not have to be dependent on my family and avoid being. That‚Äôs as good as this is going to ever get and I‚Äôm tired. I even have people from my past that like to play games with me and come back when they‚Äôre bored and then later on if I don‚Äôt make a peep, then make a point of like smashing my head into the ground to remind me I‚Äôm not wanted in defective. It‚Äôs happened a couple times this year where people I‚Äôve just people I thought would be around for a long time to just left. It‚Äôs not even just this one version it‚Äôs like an unworthy to anybody my life is suffering. And I‚Äôm sick of people‚Äòs bullshit lectures that I just need to get out there and try harder they call me creepy they told me I was a stranger. I‚Äôll always be that fucking creepy stranger that doesn‚Äôt even like I don‚Äôt even deserve to have someone to reach out to. Nobody wants to see or be around me either people flat out. Tell me I‚Äôm they dont  need anything out of me anymore and I have to go. Occasionally, I even get a nasty one who returns just to bully me remind me I‚Äôm unworthy and tell me I should kill myself. But it‚Äôs not even just her. It‚Äôs just like over and over and over I‚Äôm tired of having to just fucking let go after people are done using me. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve never allowed to have any like needs or wants of my own or even fucking sometimes need conversation or someone to hang out with You. Make one mistake as well just one and people they just shine  you. I can hide eventually ill, but I can‚Äôt hide the other things. I can‚Äôt hide im  awkward. The only answer is to withdraw and I do that until I can‚Äôt take anymore. I can‚Äôt. I have to be so careful to do anything with my deficits will come through even when I‚Äôm able to pretend I‚Äôm mentally stable. I get lost easily and I‚Äôm a horrible sense of direction which is gonna be a problem with my phone is shut off. I can‚Äôt mixed up on the trains, trying to find myself places and sometimes I end up late even when I leave hours earlier and people have no patience for that they just go without you. I suck in group activities that involve team sports because I‚Äôm clumsy. The only thing I can actually do and do well is make jokes out of it so no matter what happens to me how humiliated I am I can always make people have even a whole room full‚Ä¶ About things I was crying about later.

And they‚Äôre right . even my entire family hates me. Nobody wants to hear from me. Nobody wants to see me and everything is just so exhausting. The amount of work and time and distances.

It‚Äôs not a luxury resort. It‚Äôs not remote wilderness. But it is a carefully crafted, joy-sprinkled, bougie little oasis tucked into a quiet residential neighborhood in Southwest Florida. It has:

A vintage camper with AC that will literally chill your soul (10,000 BTU, baby).
A clawfoot soaking tub under the stars.
A private toilet + outdoor shower (don‚Äôt worry, no baggies here).
A tiki bar, shaded kitchen, and even a misting fan if you‚Äôre feelin‚Äô fancy.
And vibes? Oh, we‚Äôve got vibes. ‚ú®
I made this for people like me‚Äîthose who don‚Äôt need a whole vacation, just a day or night to reset, relax, or sip something strong and remember who they are.

I would love to hear anyone's favorite spots for food in general, but in particular if anyone has any for milk tea, oyster omelettes, local-style breakfast, coffee, and Taiwanese desserts, that would be excellent! Also, I'm not sure how prevalent it is in Taiwan, but if anyone has any recommendations for ÂáâËå∂ I'd be grateful. 

We'd also like to visit a night market but my friend has social anxiety so I would like to avoid overly crowded areas if possible. Does anyone have any recommendations for less crowded times or night markets that are more low-key?

I'm currently learning Mandarin and looking to pick up some books for learning Taiwanese Mandarin, if anyone has any recommended book shops. 

Finally, if there are any neighborhoods you'd recommend that are nice to wander around in, I'd love to hear them!!

I‚Äôm a girl who likes wine nights, going downtown to drink, watching Marvel movies, painting, thrifting, and cooking. I found myself enjoying hiking/trekking with friends last Spring too. Additionally, I‚Äôm interested to do volunteer works, learn to play golf, attend workshops (like coffee making, pottery, etc).

1. wake up
2. reach for phone scroll tiktok/instagram/reddit for 30-60 minutes
3. feel behind and shit before i even got out of bed

so i started making tiny switches. not a 5am cold plunge routine, but just small things that made my brain and body feel alive in the morning.

here‚Äôs the full list of things i rotate through (not all every day, but most of these help a lot):

* get sunlight within 10 minutes of waking up (i use an app to block my apps until i take a pic of sun)
* stretch my neck, back, and legs (does wonders for grogginess)
* drink a glass of water with a pinch of salt (electrolytes help more than coffee sometimes)
* write down 1 single priority for the day (not a to-do list, just the¬†one¬†thing)
* take a short walk, even just around the block
* breathwork for 2‚Äì3 mins (inhale 4 sec, hold 4, exhale 6‚Äì8, calms everything)
* tidy one small thing (bed, sink, desk; gets momentum going)

the biggest lesson: your morning doesn‚Äôt need to be productive, but it should feel intentional.

starting my day with my body instead of against it has been a game changer. hope this helps anyone trying to break the phone-scroll cycle. let me know if you've got any other good little habits!",13,1748392391.0,DecidingToBeBetter,3,1.0,False

There‚Äôs so much going on with staff nowadays in our 1-3 yo class room.
Every week now someone has been on vacation (luckily only 1 at a time) and we‚Äôve been down to 4:18. 

Now bring the constantly ‚Äúsick‚Äù co worker into the mix who has been ghosting us since Monday morning when she was supposed back from leave. This is not the first time or second. Honestly don‚Äôt understand how she still has a job her, she calls in like half the time. So sick of it.

We‚Äôre down to 3:18. It‚Äôs absolute madness because the group is also incredibly difficult (apparently the directors most difficult group, from 18 year experience). They are all over the place and rile each other up, can‚Äôt focus for more than 2 seconds and won‚Äôt listen.

It‚Äôs like a tornado moving inside the classroom when they group up and charge each other‚Äôs energies. Every task has to be a pain and absolute chaos. A few children have higher needs that we get no extra support for, triggered into meltdowns from the overstimulating environment. It‚Äôs like an out of body experience in the toughest moments. 

Even in such circumstances the room leader unapologetically takes her long ass coffee breaks and daily unnecessarily long ‚Äúmeetings‚Äù with office, leaving us 2:18 like this morning

Idk why but the 1:5 ratio has never been respected since I started. I blamed it on understaffing but clearly it‚Äôs not just that if you can‚Äôt prioritise the class over your gossiping and coffee time.

Had to vent. Been keeping my mouth shut on negative staff behaviour because I feel guilty for not showing them understanding & don‚Äôt want to be mean to anyone, but when is enough enough?

fast forward to march of this year, still self employed but circumstances came up where i could no longer travel for work which was not only a chunk of my income but my regular socialization, so i figured i would supplement my income a bit AND meet some new people by going back to starbucks part time. i got hired and finished my training at the end of march and my first non-training shift gave me immediate whiplash. new hires are stuck on DTO which was draining and i was really not prepared to DTO peaks and was immediately scheduled to be a regular opener. asking most of my shifts for direction or to teach me a task id never been taught was like pulling teeth. when i was finally put on bar regularly, i was still pretty quick and efficient at crafting drinks but the printers NEVER STOP and adding cold foam to everything and writing on cups adds so much unnecessary time while people who just placed their mobiles are sitting in the drive thru with an attitude because their drink with 100 modifications isnt ready in 2 minutes. the bare bones training, the passive aggressive messages about drive times and ""back to starbucks"" garbage made me realize that i am working fast food. i dont want to work fast food and starbucks never felt like fast food when i initially worked for the company. my store just started taking delivery orders and im done. i like the baristas at my store fine and really feel terrible screwing anyone over as the schedules are made for 3 weeks out but i cant do it anymore. its somehow worse than the stress i felt being a shift and i only work part time. i left a notice of resignation in the office today after drowning on solo bar for 3 hours straight. i will never wake up at 4 am for a job again ü•≤

My wife was issued a ¬£100 Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN) for ‚Äúlittering‚Äù near King‚Äôs Cross Station in London. Here‚Äôs what happened:

We were traveling from Oxford to Cambridge and had coffee from Paddington Station, which we carried all the way to King‚Äôs Cross.

At King‚Äôs Cross station exit, we were trying to figure out which train or platform we needed to take for our connection to Cambridge. I had a large luggage bag in one hand and googple maps on my phone in the other, and my wife was holding our 3.5-year-old daughter.

She briefly placed the coffee cups next to the wall near the exit (not on the ground) because she was tired and we were still standing there, trying to sort out where to go.

An enforcement officer approached and started taking my wife‚Äôs details without fully explaining why. When I realised what was happening and asked, the officer said it was a ¬£100 fine. I picked up the cups immediately and tried to explain the situation, but they weren‚Äôt interested.

Another male officer arrived with an aggressive attitude, demanding my name and postcode without identifying himself or explaining why. He only backed off after the first officer clarified that I had picked up the cups and my wife was the one they were issuing the FPN to.

I understand technically placing items can be considered littering, but we didn‚Äôt leave them or walk away ‚Äì we were just standing there, trying to figure out where to go with no bins in sight. My wife was exhausted and holding a child.

Camden Council‚Äôs website says there‚Äôs no formal appeal process, but you can ‚Äúrequest a review‚Äù within 14 days of the FPN. I‚Äôm torn:

Should I just pay the ¬£100 fine to avoid escalation?

Or should I write to them, explaining the context and asking them to reconsider?

Has anyone successfully challenged a littering FPN by explaining the circumstances? Do councils actually listen to this kind of thing?


Any advice or shared experiences would be much appreciated!

I (26F, Latina) just got married to my husband Liam (30M), and although our wedding was overall beautiful and magical, a situation involving my sister-in-law-in-law left me feeling conflicted. I‚Äôd appreciate your perspective.

So here‚Äôs the deal. In my culture, there‚Äôs a distinction between a cu√±ada (sister-in-law, like your husband‚Äôs sister or your brother‚Äôs wife), and a concu√±ada, which in English would be something like a sister-in-law-in-law‚Äîthe wife of your husband‚Äôs sibling. Let‚Äôs call mine Camille (27F). She‚Äôs married to my husband‚Äôs older brother, Mark (32M). My actual sister-in-law Sophie (married to my brother) was there too and saw everything unfold. (Side note Sophie wasn‚Äôt part of my bridesmaids but she was included in the morning of the wedding for make up and hair cause we are a lot more closer and cause she asked me for a place to get her make up done at least 2 months prior to the wedding, and I have the gf of one of my bridesmaids cancel but her spot was already on the contract, so I told Sophie she could be with us, besides that my brother couldn‚Äôt make it to the wedding and I didn‚Äôt want for her to feel alone) 

A couple of months before the wedding, I stayed in North Carolina with my father and mother in-law and one of my brothers-in-law Jack (27). I don‚Äôt have many friends there and we were living in a retirement community, so I spent a lot of time at home. Camille and Mark also live in NC but farther away, and since I don‚Äôt drive and I‚Äôm not familiar with the area, I didn‚Äôt invite her over. That said, on previous trips to NC, I did try to connect with her and help her with things I know are important to her professionally. We‚Äôre not close, but I always try to be cordial and respectful.

The day before the wedding:
We had our rehearsal dinner after walking through the ceremony logistics. Btw the wedding was in my home country. I wasn‚Äôt really doing formal introductions‚Äîjust saying hi to some of my husband‚Äôs friends I hadn‚Äôt met and introducing him to a couple of my bridesmaids. Camille wasn‚Äôt a bridesmaid, but her husband Mark was one of the groomsmen. My sister-in-law Sophie later told me Camille was visibly upset, that no one had introduced her properly, and that she looked uncomfortable all night. She wasn‚Äôt alone, though‚Äîshe was with my in-laws.

Later, Camille and Mark showed up late to the rehearsal dinner. It was raining, so that was understandable. What caught me a little off guard was that Camille arrived in athletic wear and a very bright rain jacket. The event had a formal vibe (even if not fully black tie yet), but I figured maybe her clothes got wet or she was just caught off guard. No big deal.

The glam squad situation:
That night, as we were all saying goodbye, I reminded my bridesmaids about our morning schedule. That‚Äôs when Mark asked my husband Liam, if Camille was coming to the hotel to get ready with us. Liam asked me, and I said no. We had a glam team hired with a contract and a specific headcount. And to be honest, Camille and I had never had a conversation about her getting her hair and makeup done with us. It hadn‚Äôt even crossed my mind.
I didn‚Äôt think she‚Äôd want to spend money on separate glam either‚Äîmainly because I‚Äôve been told (though I‚Äôve never witnessed it myself) that they sometimes ask my father-in-law to pay for parts of their trips. For example, in this case, I was told Camille went to my father-in-law insisting he book the Airbnb immediately after New Year‚Äôs or else she would charge it herself and invoice him later. My father-in-law often gives in because he doesn‚Äôt want to cause any problems.

That night, things escalated. Mark and Liam had a heated conversation where Mark said things like ‚ÄúIf my wife isn‚Äôt welcome, then I‚Äôm not welcome either,‚Äù and that he, Liam, and Camille needed to talk‚Äîjust the three of them. Without me. Which I found kind of absurd, because‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre talking about the morning of my wedding. Why would my husband have a closed-door meeting about it without me?

The morning of the wedding:
My MIL texted me the night before saying she‚Äôd be with Camille the next morning. I replied kindly that it wouldn‚Äôt be possible. I told her the schedule and the glam team were locked in and that I didn‚Äôt want her caught in the middle. I asked her to let Liam talk to his brother directly.

That morning, my FIL, one of the groomsmen and Jack came to our suite to bring pastries and coffee. They mentioned Mark was possibly not going to the hotel because Camille was so upset. Just to be clear‚ÄîMark was never not going to the wedding. He was just thinking about skipping the prep at the hotel and going directly to the ceremony.
Our photographer was arriving soon, and I didn‚Äôt want this turning into a big thing. I told my wedding planner to let Camille know that if she wanted to come for the photos, she could. Glam wasn‚Äôt an option at that point, but I was trying to meet her halfway. My husband also talked to her to say we were waiting. She refused.

She had been crying for hours before the ceremony even began, and even at the place of the ceremony, also mentioned to Jack she was not going to wear make up cause she‚Äôll be crying all day. And when the ceremony started, she was visibly furious. She looks absolutely miserable in every single photo.

The reception:
Our wedding was black tie mandatory, and Camille wore a turquoise North Face rain jacket over her outfit. It clashed with the entire aesthetic and stands out in all the photos.

During the reception, my brother-in-law Jack (our best man) gave a beautiful speech about our relationship and called me his best friend. Camille cried throughout the whole thing‚Äîbut not in a sentimental way. Then she disappeared.

We had arranged a special dish for her because she has some food restrictions, and I was worried someone else would accidentally be served her plate. I asked my husband where she was and he said, ‚ÄúShe went to the bathroom,‚Äù but the bathroom was on the opposite end of the venue. Then Mark left to find her. When I asked the wedding planner to check on them, she said they were fighting and Mark told her they‚Äôd be back in five minutes. She gently reminded them this wasn‚Äôt the time or place. An hour later, they left the wedding without saying goodbye to us‚Äîonly to my in-laws.

They missed the dinner, the dancing, and everything else.

In light of the new moon, I did road opener/block buster with green good luck candle (3rd time lighting it), coffee, and intentions wrote on paper anointed by olive oil. When I put paper on candle it took out the flame. I relit and burnt at least half the paper, and flame was really strong (2-3 flames) by the wind (took outside because it got too smoky indoors), then I blew it out/put a little water on it. 
Did I do it right/was there any bad or good omens?

For further context earlier today I pulled a 4 of pentacles card and a resistance African oracle card (basically saying there is resistance/blockages I need to open. Candle was more speaking to my own blockage but I can‚Äôt rule out external ones).

Hi all! Currently 51 and I have been single since August 2015. I have dated, but no long term partners since I have really learned to love my solitude and my man-free home. I have 2 teens living with me 50/50, with 4 cats, a dog and a ball python so tons of company and never lonely, with friends too in this mix.

I had taken a break from dating for about 2 years since perimenopause has wrecked havoc with my libido, but with HRT I am back to my normal and open to dating. I am on Coffee Meets Bagel app and for some reason I either attract younger men (28-35) or men over 60. 

Curious if any of my co-50's peers have tried dating men 10 years older than them?

We talked for about 3 weeks in app, then went out for coffee, then a few weeks later we went to a hockey game, and a few weeks after that we went to a museum and had dinner after. Our texts got more infrequent after the hockey game, but I attributed that to the busyness of her job. Otherwise, I thought we were really hitting it off. We even had another date tentatively planned (a movie). I should mention, these dates were honestly more like outings, I was just trying to get to know her better, wasn't trying to be pushy, but I had hopped in the next few dates or conversations we could start having the conversation of taking things beyond just getting to know each other as friends.

However, after the third ""date"" she never replied back. My first message was just asking her if she got back okay. But she didn't reply and  I took it as her being busy again. Then by the weekend we were going to see the movie, I started to get worried and a bit upset, because we had made plans but I wasn't hearing from her. No texts, no snap-chats, no bumble messages, not picking up for phone calls, did not accept a Facebook friend request.

But unlike first dates I've done which didn't go well, she hasn't blocked me on any platform. I've tried to reach out numerous times, but I've also tried to be sparse sending messages because I don't want to blow up her phone. I know her job is busy, but I feel like she could at least tell me she want's to be done? It's like she died. I sent her one last message today after calling her a second time and she didn't pick up.

Whatever this infection is from, it seems atypical. It did not show up on the culture taken a week prior to my cruise, so i was initially told it was NOT a UTI. but after seeing another doctor at an urgent care, he thought it was still a UTI based on my symptoms, which was only right sided pain that would also move to my back, and nausea...no other symptoms but i did have wbc in my urine.

Once, in one of my Italian classes, a student raised their hand and asked, ""Why does the *congiuntivo* exist?"" Ah, the infamous *congiuntivo*‚Äîthe Italian subjunctive mood. It's a grammar beast that even native speakers sometimes wrestle with. If you're learning Italian, you might find yourself in the same boat, scratching your head over this elusive mood.

**Why the subjunctive is a head-scratcher**

Picture this: you're trying to express doubt, hope, or a wish in Italian, and suddenly you're in a linguistic labyrinth. English speakers, in particular, find the subjunctive tricky because it's not used much in English. You might hear it in phrases like ""I suggest that he go,"" but that's about it. In Italian, though, the subjunctive is a whole different ball game.

**Real-life scenarios**

Imagine you're at an Italian caf√©, and you want to say, ""I hope the coffee is good."" In Italian, you'd say, *Spero che il caff√® sia buono.* Notice the *sia* instead of *√®*? That's the subjunctive at work!

**Tips from a teacher**

Here are a few tips to tame the *congiuntivo*:

- **Practice with common expressions:** Start with phrases like *Spero che tu stia bene* (I hope you are well).

- **Pair verbs with the subjunctive:** Learn verbs that often lead to the subjunctive, like *credere* (to believe) and *sperare* (to hope).

- **Focus on irregular forms:** Some verbs have irregular subjunctive forms. Get familiar with them.

**Your turn!**

Have you ever tangled with the *congiuntivo*? How did it go? Share your stories, and let's navigate this Italian grammar jungle together!

So, up until recently I have only been using glass cups for my espresso, both, single and double walled. However, for the past few days I decided to start using a stone/ceramic cup that my wife had gotten for me. For context, I always thought that glass cups are superior in terms of experience because you can see the different color gradients and crema while you're pulling the shot as well as when drinking the coffee, which I find fun. 

  
It's been almost exactly one week since I included the ceramic espresso cup into my rotation, and I can't necesserely explain it but shots taste different in it. The first thing I noticed was that the color of the espresso pops more in the ceramic cup (that's to be expected due to the contrast of the cup walls and liquid). 

Now, my second observation is (maybe) ridiculous, but coffee tastes ""better"" in the ceramic mug. Especially, medium/dark roasts,  the body feels thicker with deeper chocolatey flavors. 

I know I may sound crazy and I am not suggesting that the coffee/liquid is any different in either cup, I know that the difference is mostly sensory, but I can't quite grasp why.

1kx2fzr,https://i.redd.it/eoxqug89me3f1.jpeg,How We Lost the Moon (And Why LLMs Might Be Making It Worse),"**TLDR**: The Apollo program's forgotten knowledge is a cautionary tale for how we're learning with LLMs today. Experts have mountains of experience, but newcomers are building knowledge pillars on shifting sand.

  
*This is the first in a series of articles written by Ariel Commodorian, an independent analyst from Argentina. The aim is not to oppose technology, but to help improve it through critical and constructive reflection.*  


# The Casual Take (Grab a Coffee Story)

Did you know that after the US landed on the Moon, we basically forgot how we did it? I'm not kidding ‚Äì we stopped sending crewed missions, disbanded teams, and lost a ton of the technical know-how. Today, companies like SpaceX have to re-solve problems that were already figured out in the 60s.

Something similar is happening with LLMs. Veterans have years of solid experience in their heads that never gets transferred to any model. Meanwhile, young people learning directly from chatbots risk building shaky ""knowledge pillars"" that fall apart the moment they get a convincing-sounding but wrong answer.

Bottom line: if we don't care about how knowledge gets built and passed down, we'll end up rebuilding rockets we already built... but without the blueprints.

# The Professional Take (Conference Presentation Mode)

The Apollo project wasn't just a space race ‚Äì it was a collective feat of engineering, documentation, trial and error. However, after its peak in 1969, and especially with falling political and budgetary interest in the 70s, a significant portion of the technical knowledge that made it possible wasn't systematically preserved. Some stayed in blueprints, but much was lost in engineers' heads, in undocumented tacit processes. Decades later, modern programs like SpaceX had to redo solutions that were already discovered, at enormous costs in time and money.

This dynamic reflects a concerning pattern in generative AI. Veteran workers possess solid ""knowledge pillars"" ‚Äì the result of years of articulated experience, tested against reality and put through trials. However, that knowledge rarely transfers to LLMs: it's neither explicitly trained nor formalized for robust integration.

In contrast, younger generations often begin learning from the LLM interface itself. Without rigorous validation, contrast, and error processes, these users can build defective ""pillars"": superficial knowledge that's plausible but epistemically fragile. Just like with Apollo, the risk is clear: lose expert knowledge without leaving traces, while training new experts on eroding foundations.

# The Technical Deep Dive (Academic Paper Mode)

The analogy between post-Apollo ""technical amnesia"" and LLM-induced epistemological erosion holds across three axes: (1) loss of non-formalized tacit knowledge, (2) dependence on opaque high-complexity systems, and (3) generational training on unverified bases.

During Apollo, systems engineering and subsystem integration (propulsion, inertial navigation, thermal control, analog redundancies) required more than blueprints ‚Äî it relied on distributed tacit expertise.. Team dissolution, technological obsolescence, and lack of functional semantic archiving meant operational knowledge wasn't preserved as transferable stack.

Today, with LLMs as primary epistemic interface for digital natives, a homologous risk emerges. Models operate as generative response systems with high plausibility but low epistemological traceability by design (Stochastic Parrots, Bender et al., 2021). Content generation without rigorous validation fosters what we might call ""epistemic degradation by interface"": users substituting construction processes with queries, inhibiting consolidation of structured knowledge schemas (System 2, Kahneman 2011; Deep Knowledge Structures, Sweller 2006).

Simultaneously, the lack of expert knowledge integration in training datasets ‚Äì due to absence of verified corpora or structural formalization of tacit knowledge ‚Äì limits LLMs' potential to even partially replace that layer. This underscores the urgency for ""epistemic preservation protocols"": hybrid interfaces or expert-curated buffers that retain tacit knowledge and prevent its dissolution in stochastic abstraction.

The world of food saw a flurry of activity on May 27, 2025, ranging from consumer health advice and celebrity encounters to the latest fluctuations in the food processing and beverage industry stocks. Here‚Äôs a comprehensive overview of the key developments:

**Decoding Food Labels and Navigating Dietary Choices**

A crucial piece of consumer information highlighted the often-misunderstood language used on food packaging. As reported by indianexpress.com, the distinction between ""sugar-free"" and ""no added sugar"" labels is critical for making informed dietary choices. The report underscored that while both terms suggest lower sugar content, they aren't interchangeable. Kanikka Malhotra, a consultant dietician and certified diabetes educator, clarified that ‚ÄúThe terms ‚Äòsugar-free‚Äô and ‚Äòno added sugar‚Äô are regulated differently across the globe.‚Äù This nuance is particularly important for individuals managing diabetes or closely monitoring their sugar intake, as misunderstanding these labels can lead to unintended sugar consumption. This emphasis on clarity aims to help consumers make informed choices when navigating the complex world of food labels.

**Celebrity Food Preferences and the Allure of a Classic Dish**

Celebrity food preferences also made headlines, with a glimpse into the interactions between renowned choreographer Farah Khan and actress Alaya F. Khan, known for her culinary skills, visited Alaya F's Mumbai home, bringing along her special roast chicken, cooked by her cook Dilip. The twist? Alaya F, who is currently on a month-long vegetarian journey, had to decline the offering. She explained, ""I am a vegetarian for this month. Yes, I can have roast chicken next month."" Her mother, Pooja Bedi, however, seemed more than happy to enjoy the dish. This anecdote offers a lighthearted look into the evolving food choices of celebrities and underscores the enduring appeal of classic comfort food, even for those taking a temporary hiatus from meat. Khan‚Äôs roast chicken recipe, which she shared previously, further highlights the interest in home-cooked meals.

**Market Trends and Stock Performance in the Food Industry**

The financial sector saw noteworthy activity within the food and beverage industry, with significant updates on the performance of key stocks. Three major players in the Indian food market ‚Äì Nestle India, Britannia Industries, and Tata Consumer Products ‚Äì saw their share prices fluctuate during the day.

*   **Nestle India:** Operating in the Food Processing & Packaging sector, Nestle India's share price was at ‚Çπ2466.15. The stock experienced fluctuations, with a low of ‚Çπ2431.65 and a high of ‚Çπ2481.6. Over the past 52 weeks, shares saw a low of ‚Çπ2115 and a high of ‚Çπ2777. Performance metrics indicated a 0.39% return in one day, 2.45% over the past month, and 8.1% in the last three months. The daily pivot level was set at 2443.68.
*   **Britannia Industries:** Also in the Food Processing & Packaging sector, Britannia Industries had a share price of ‚Çπ5497.75. The stock fluctuated with a low of ‚Çπ5477.2 and a high of ‚Çπ5537. Over the past 52 weeks, shares saw a low of ‚Çπ4506.5 and a high of ‚Çπ6473.1. The stock showed a -0.44% return in one day, 1.25% over the past month, and 14.88% in the last three months. The daily pivot level for the stock was set at 5508.17.
*   **Tata Consumer Products:** Operating in the Tea & Coffee sector, Tata Consumer Products' share price was at ‚Çπ1136.7. The stock fluctuated between a low of ‚Çπ1127.4 and a high of ‚Çπ1149.4. Over the past 52 weeks, shares saw a low of ‚Çπ884 and a high of ‚Çπ1246.42. The performance metrics showed a -0.75% return in one day, -1.67% over the past month, and 12.82% in the last three months. The daily pivot level was 1138.08.

These market updates highlight the dynamic nature of the food industry. While all three companies are Largecap stocks, their performance varied significantly, showing the impact of market forces, consumer trends, and company-specific factors. Investors and analysts closely watch these fluctuations as indicators of the overall health and future prospects of the companies and the industry as a whole.

**Food and Lifestyle: Recipes and Digital Assistance**

The Guardian's ""Feast"" app represents a modern approach to food and recipe access. The app functions as a digital cookbook, offering over 5,000 recipes, searchable by ingredients, and equipped with features designed to simplify the cooking process. This kind of readily accessible, technology-driven approach to cooking showcases the changing relationship consumers have with food preparation and the evolving methods of food consumption.

1kx2fdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kx2fdi/help_me_tweak_my_gemilai_3149/,Help me tweak my Gemilai 3149,"Hey there! As I mentioned in the title, I need some tweaks to our Gemilai 3149 espresso machine. We're a small delivery-only coffee venture in the Philippines operated by a husband-and-wife duo. We picked the Gemilai 3149 because it's the most affordable one that meets our need for a machine: dual boiler, PID system, direct water line (assisted by an electric pump, of course), preinfusion function, the works. It's not the best machine I've used but because I can tweak a number of settings, I can pull a respectable shot.

While we have made a number of upgrades to our workflow such as a calibrated tamper and WDT tool, I was actually thinking of doing some tweaks to the machine side of things, specifically the portafilter (and basket) and the group shower screen. That said, other tweaks are welcome as long as we don't have to fiddle with the guts (I'm not comfortable with my tinkering skills).

So anyway, here's what I have so far, which confuses the bejeesus out of me:

* I messaged Pesado about compatibility of their [high-diffusion shower screens](https://pesado585.com/products/pesado-hd-high-diffusion-shower-screen) with Gemilai E61 group, but here's what they said (sucks but it is what it is):

>unfortunately¬†the Gemilai uses a different type of threaded diffusion screw on the E61 group head, one that is not compatible with the one we made

* I messaged a local supplier of coffee tools that sells IMS shower screens and recommended [this](https://www.pukawcoffeetools.com/collections/precision-shower-screens/products/ims-precision-shower-screen-e61200im) and [this](https://www.pukawcoffeetools.com/collections/precision-shower-screens/products/e61-matrix%C2%AE-shower-screen) for my machine, but doesn't guarantee compatibility.
* However, I also saw [this video](https://youtu.be/T2GqNAt4tTE) where they change the shower screen of a Gemilai 3605 with an IMS one specifically designed for La Cimbali (the video says it's [CI200NT](https://imsfiltri.com/prodotto/ci200nt/) so it's definitely for La Cimbali).

Anyway, if you have worked on this machine before and have suggestions, I'm open to suggestions. So far, what I'm thinking of getting are the following:

* Shower screen replacement (IMS CI200NT is my top contender so far if the YouTube video above is to be believed)
* Straight-walled portafilter basked (looking at IMS Big Bang)
* Bottomless portafilter (some generic 58mm one will do)

That said, take note that we're locked in with this machine for a while, which means that's the answer to your ""why not get XYZ machine instead?"" reply. I'm happy with this machine so far, and I want to overcome its limitations by working with it, not simply making it go away.

Looking forward to hearing from y'all. Thanks!

I‚Äôll be super upfront with you to save you some time in case you actually clicked into this post. 

I‚Äôm only interested in men in North America, PST, MST,or central would be ideal. Only looking for around mid thirties to forties. I‚Äôm agnostic and liberal.

Since you are on this specific sub i can imagine finding someone has been a challenge. We both know this isn‚Äôt easy, we don‚Äôt do things with rose-colored glasses at our age. It‚Äôs lonely out here and I‚Äôm just trying to find someone that i can connect with. It doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect, and let‚Äôs be real, it won‚Äôt be. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be real. 

Ok now to the rest.

I see men post and talk all the time about fun and passion and adventure‚Ä¶and I‚Äôm none of that. I live a very simple, routine-based, uncomplicated life. Am i happy? No, not really. Am i unhappy? No, not really either. I kinda just am. 

I don‚Äôt have niche interests, I‚Äôm not gonna be player two in whatever games you like to play. I don‚Äôt really care about your unique tastes in obscure music. I don‚Äôt follow any sports. 

I‚Äôm very much a basic B. I like ice coffee, i read, i have cats, i sing-along (very poorly) to Taylor swift and Disney music. I like shopping, i like hiking, i like coloring and artsy stuff. 

I don‚Äôt think our interests need to align, you can have your thing and i can have my thing. I want something more than just friends, i want a connection that transcends our hobbies and the crap that people thinks defines us. 

And cuz the physical does actually matter, here‚Äôs me:

Today, it skipped 45 minutes ahead and during my coffee break, I looked down and it wasn't moving so I tapped my watch face a few times and it started to move again. I'm getting quite frustrated since I use my watch everyday and I rely on it a lot at work.

1kx25yj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kx25yj,My own HwaBoon‚Ä¶and a tutorial!!,"I finally made a full-sized HwaBoon!!! I'm so excited and I love it so much. I thought I'd share my process in case anyone was wondering, but let me preface this by saying I am NOT an expert and I was totally making this up as I went along. 

I only made one HwaBoon, but made two different pot styles because I couldn't decide which style I wanted to use (the original style from when the show opened or the newer style they started using a couple months ago - pics 1 and 2, respectively). 

I included one of my Mini HwaBoons in the photo for color reference. As you can see, the paint I used is slightly less green, but I wanted a spray paint so my choices were more limited than with other types of paint. From studying one zillion pictures of HwaBoon, it seems the OG pot was slightly more green and shorter and the newer pot is slightly more blue and taller, but since we'll never see the two together so I'm just using my best guess on colors and dimensions.

So...here are the details for those who are wondering!

Succulents - I scoured the internet and thought these were the closest match to the OG HwaBoon: CM4128-CV (15464) - Echeveria Pick X3 13"" Coffee ‚Äî Designer Flower Center LLC (https://designerflowercenter.net/products/echeveria-pick-x3-13-coffee-ea-12)

I ordered two. The newer HwaBoon has slightly different shapes/colors so if you're wanting to model off of that version you might want to shop around more. I think people have also used these more affordable ones from Michael's: Ashland¬Æ Succulent Pick | Michaels (https://www.michaels.com/product/ashland-succulent-pick-10128870)

Daisy - I never did find a daisy that was JUST like the one in the show. I went with this one from Etsy, but any pink Gerbera daisy is probably going to have the same effect. 25.6"" Real Touch Gerbera Daisy Ôºåartificial Faux Flower in 7 Colors for BouquetÔºåweddingÔºåparty - Etsy (https://www.etsy.com/listing/1676636258/256-real-touch-gerbera-daisy-artificial)

Pot - I modeled them myself and printed them in white (available here: Pot for DIY Hwaboon From Maybe Happy Ending Hwaboon Broadway Musical - POT ONLY - Etsy; https://www.etsy.com/listing/4311561226/?ref=share_ios_native_control) The OG pot is 5.7 inches tall and the newer style is 6 inches tall. 

I started by spray-painting the white pot (pic 3) with Rustoleum Ocean Mist gloss paint. Spray paint upside down to keep the interior white (pic 4). (I was going to use a filler primer first to smooth out layer lines and get all fancy with sanding, but I ended up skipping this step and jumping straight to the Ocean Mist paint.) 

Once dry, I hand-painted painted black on the lip of the pot with just plain acrylic paint. The black rim on real HwaBoon is roughly painted, but I don't do ""random"" very well, so ended up just painting it solidly black. Then I sealed it with Rustoleum Triple Thick Glaze (pic 5).

Next I prepped the succulents (pic 6) by just pulling the heads off - they pop right off. I attached each one to 18"" stem wire (pic 7). Paper Wrapped Stem Wire by Ashland¬Æ | Michaels (https://www.michaels.com/product/paper-wrapped-stem-wire-by-ashland-10174354?michaelsStore=2028&inv=4) I just used super strong tape, but you could also use wire or hot glue (pic 8/9).

Next I figured out how I wanted the succulents to be arranged (pic 10). 

The next step was figuring out how to make the stems thicker and give it that twisted look that real HwaBoon has (pic 11). 

To make the stems thicker, I tried a few things, but ultimately ended up just wrapping them in a layer of the same tape that I already had. https://a.co/d/6bJQggo  Painter's tape, masking tape, or something else would also work - it's just what I had. (pic 12)  
 
Then I used this Wired Hemp by Ashland¬Æ | Michaels (https://www.michaels.com/product/wired-hemp-by-ashland-10336518?michaelsStore=2028&inv=7) to wrap each stem (pic 13). You're also going to cover the whole thing with this floral tape (pic 14) Brown Floral Tape by Ashland‚Ñ¢ | Michaels (https://www.michaels.com/product/brown-floral-tape-by-ashland-10250036?michaelsStore=2028&inv=2). Starting at the top of each stem, I'd wrap it down to where the stem joins another stem in my layout and then add in the next stem and keep wrapping. It took some trial and error to figure out the best order, so my advice here is to leave your wire long when you cut it so you can go back and re-wrap a section if needed. Once you've gotten it how you want it, trim the ends of the long stem wires to the same length (pic 16).

On top of the wire layer, you're going to wrap the whole thing in the floral tape (which you can see that I've started in pics 15/16 - the tops of the stems are easier to do before you start attaching them to other stems). If you've never worked with it before, it sticks to itself so you don't need any other tape/glue to use it. You just have to give each section a light stretch (important!!) to activate the stickiness and then wrap it tightly around the stems overlapping as you go. Make sure to fully cover the tape/wire underneath (pic 17 shows it all wrapped). 

Then I needed to paint the stem. I ended up using two acrylic paints I had around the house (pic 18) and a kitchen sponge so it wasn't too uniform like it would be with a brush. I used a tan and a green and just sponged them on randomly. It's not perfect up close, but good enough - I was about to chuck the whole thing out of the window after fiddling with the wire and floral tape. Lol.

Then I shaved down some dry floral foam to fit in the pot (pic 19). It cuts easily with an box cutter or kitchen knife. You only need one block from a pack like this: FloraCraft¬Æ DryF≈çM Brick Green | Michaels. (https://www.michaels.com/product/floracraft-dryfm-brick-green-10302810?michaelsStore=2028&inv=16)

I twisted the knife into the foam to make a hole for the HwaBoon branch and used a straw to poke a hole for the daisy (which I trimmed to the right height). (Pic 19).

Then I put the whole thing in the pot and poured some marbles around it to help stabilize the foam (since I didn't want to glue it in so I could switch pots) and give HwaBoon some heft so he isn't top-heavy. Then I put some Spanish moss on top. Spanish Moss by Ashland¬Æ | Michaels (https://www.michaels.com/product/spanish-moss-by-ashland-10349407?michaelsStore=6001&inv=5)

 But whenever he found out that anything was going on without him he would get super passive aggressive and start blowing up peoples phones or acting weird.

Also, as usual, I wrote some ""in-universe"" texts for them:

**Fresno Nightcrawler:**

>This guy (gal?) is awesome! Chill as hell, and really easygoing. Only problem is, the maintenance crew keeps finding them asleep somewhere and putting them in the laundry basket. Let me tell you: waking up in the middle of a ""heavy-duty"" cycle in an industrial-sized washing machine is a surefire way to lose one's cool. Only upside? They come out smelling like Tide. 

>No one is really sure where they came from. One day, the Uber Eats guy was delivering some chow, and they just came in walking right behind. Did they walk all the way from Fresno? Should we expect the little one to show up anytime soon? Are they just a balloon and some pajama pants? We don't know, and they won't tell. Come to think of it, they don't say a whole lot. But hey, they smell like Tide...

**Jackalope:**

>Before we met Ralph, we all thought Jackalopes were cuddly, fluffy critters, happily bouncing through the trees. That was our first mistake. Had we read the available literature a little more carefully, we'd have realized these freaks are vicious and unhinged! They even recommended covering your legs with stove pipes to avoid being maimed by their antlers.

>Only thing that keeps them happy and chill? Whiskey (I mean, I'm with them there.) Good thing some of the Unexplainables are borderline alcohol... Sorry, our PR department just gently made me realize I'm misrepresenting the fact that we at Unexplainables HQ have a decent bar for after-hours activities. Nothing more. Thanks, Melinda. You can put away the taser, now...

>Aaaanyway. For whatever reason, we had a good reserve of whiskey on hand, which made Ralph's socialization way, way easier. Too bad we forgot to check periodically and ran out pretty soon after. That was our second mistake, and it ended up causing the Limping Capybara incident of '67. But that's a story for another time.

**Bob the Zombie:**

>Bob the Zombie. It has a nice ring to it, right? We're still not sure where he came from, to be honest. One day, he just started bringing people coffee during meetings. 

>I guess we all assumed he'd been recruited from one of the realities where zombies are common, like Virus-Earth (Earth-37), or Earth-158, where AI and TikTok control the global government. Thing is, there are no reports of him ever being processed through Intake, and the only clue we have is a driver's license for a ""Robert Legendre"" that fell out of his pocket once. We're all so busy that there has never been a formal inquiry. Besides, the guy's pretty chill, and as long as you have some Febreze ready, you're all set. Also, his coffee's freaking amazing.

Here‚Äôs the scene as I remember it.

The woman is a reporter or maybe even police and the team of journalists just successfully got footage of super powered people. Once the footage uploads the woman is the first one to see it in which she realizes the people in the video is actually her family and releasing this video would expose them as super-powered people. 

The woman ends up either deleting the footage or I think it was a big dramatic thing and she spilled coffee or water on all of the equipment and destroyed the footage evidence. This caused all the other staff and coworkers to become angry and upset that they lost their big moment from the footage and the woman‚Äôs boss ended up firing her on the spot because of it. The woman left with a serious facial expression almost not feeling guilty for protecting her family even if it meant losing her job. 

If anyone recognizes this specific scene please let me know. As for what channel it was on I‚Äôm not entirely sure, it could‚Äôve been a kid‚Äôs show that I‚Äôd seen years ago but for some reason the camerawork that was used that I remember wasn‚Äôt on par for a kid‚Äôs show.

1kx20fp,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexlessmarriage/comments/1kx20fp/that_rare_occasion_she_initiates/,That rare occasion she initiates,"Hi everyone - 

Same story as most of you. I'm a 48 year old HLM. My wife is a 47 LLF. The bedroom has been an issue from the beginning. At the start, it was mostly my fault. I brought a ton of religious baggage into the marriage (she didn't have any). I was learning how to be vulnerable, open with desire, know myself, etc. That was 20 years ago and for the last 15 or so, I've really been working on it. I'm in individual therapy and it's going well, but it's not 100% me. It's her too. We've had the ""talk"" more times than we should have. It just goes in circles. She's not very open to therapy. She'll say she is in theory, but only for a session or two otherwise she feels it's just silly. I don't agree, but it's not her thing. 

When I initiate, it usually doesn't go well. Admittedly, I don't think I'm very good at it, but I try. Maybe a massage, light flirting, a suggestive text, etc. It ends with same mostly with a gentle no thanks. I can tell she wants to want it, but would be happier if sex wasn't a thing she had to worry about. The other day she said, ""I owe you sex soon"" and then yesterday when I leaned in for a kiss, she pushed away and then said ""I know you were trying"". Kind of a gut punch. The night before, she'd suggested that I bring her coffee around 9:45am and we could have sex. I felt a little silly like a dog being rewarded for sitting, but played along. I made her coffee and put it on a nice tray with a flower, strawberries, some bacon, etc. When I walked in, she was still asleep after setting her alarm. I just left the breakfast up there. Around 11am, she came down and said thanks. Nothing ended up happening obviously. 

Tonight, she might initiate since she gets suggestive after a bunch of rejections. I just don't want to say yes to that. It feels one-sided and coerced. I'm sure I can do more. Be more aggressive, be more confident, etc. But eventually, it just stops being fun. Yes, I've read No More Mr. Nice Guy and I've done a lot of work on covert contracts and self-respect. I'm fine with a no and don't sulk about it. I just move on with my day and try again another time if I want to. It's just not part of our dynamic anymore and couples therapy feels out of reach for us. Our kids will be out of the house in 5 years and I'm kind of sad because then all the excuses will be gone. It'll just be us and I'm scared that I'm building up resentment that can't be undone. ",2,1748388036.0,sexlessmarriage,2,1.0,False

1kx1y6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClairvoyantPsychic/comments/1kx1y6q/are_psychic_readings_real_guidance_or_just_for/,Are Psychic Readings Real Guidance or Just for Fun? The Truth Might Surprise You! üîÆüò≤," 

Hello üëã so let‚Äôs talk about something people have VERY mixed feelings about... psychic readings üòÖüí´ Some folks totally swear by them like it‚Äôs their daily coffee ‚òï‚ú® while others are like ‚Äúnah, that‚Äôs just entertainment‚Äù üé≠üëÄ. So... which one is it? Are psychic readings just fun stuff you do for a laugh, or can they actually *guide you* in life? Let‚Äôs dive in üß†üîç

**‚ú® Get Your Psychic Reading NOW, Available 24/7! üîÆ Ready for answers? Don‚Äôt wait ‚Äì check out the top post in this subreddit for instant insights and guidance. Your future is waiting! üåü**

Okay now back to it üòÑ So here‚Äôs the truth: psychic readings can be BOTH. Yup. Depends on how you use them and what kind of mindset you bring to the table. If you‚Äôre just curious and looking to kill time, getting your cards read can be fun and spooky like watching a horror movie on a rainy night üé¨üåßÔ∏è But for some people, especially when they‚Äôre feeling stuck or confused, a reading can feel like a cosmic wake-up call üí•üíå

Think about it. When life throws you those ‚Äúwhat now??‚Äù moments ‚Äî like relationship drama üíî, career indecision üíºüò©, or just straight-up existential ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my purpose‚Äù spirals ‚Äî you want *something* to hold onto, right? That‚Äôs where tarot or psychic insight can offer a new perspective. Even if it‚Äôs not telling your future *exactly*, it helps you think about your situation in a way you might‚Äôve missed before üß©üëÅÔ∏è

Now yes... not all readings are deep and powerful. Sometimes they‚Äôre a total miss or feel generic af üò¨. And yeah, there are definitely scammy people out there pretending they‚Äôve got ‚Äúthe gift‚Äù but are really just trying to make a quick buck üí∏üôÑ. So you‚Äôve gotta use your common sense too. Trust your gut and don‚Äôt fall for anyone trying to scare you or sell you a curse removal üíÄüö´

But if you find someone who feels *real* ‚Äî someone who picks up on things they couldn‚Äôt possibly guess ‚Äî it can be kinda mind-blowing üß†üí£. Like, how did they know that? Or how did that one card describe my whole situation?! üò≤üé¥ Those are the moments that make you wonder if something bigger *is* at play in the universe üååüåÄ

A lot of people who turn to psychic guidance aren‚Äôt doing it for flashy predictions either. They want comfort, clarity, or even just someone to listen while they sort out their emotions üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Sometimes it‚Äôs easier to hear advice when it‚Äôs wrapped in a mystical vibe. Kinda like therapy but with sparkles ‚ú®ü™¨

And real talk: it doesn‚Äôt *have* to be 100% accurate to be valuable. Sometimes just the reflection and questions during a reading are what help you make a choice. Like when a card says ‚Äúlet go‚Äù and you‚Äôre like ‚Äúugh fine, I *know* I need to but I didn‚Äôt want to admit it‚Äù üòÖüíî It pushes you to be honest with yourself. And that‚Äôs pretty powerful.

So is it guidance? Yep. Is it entertainment? Also yep. Depends on the vibe. Some people use astrology and tarot like spiritual tools üîßüåü and others are like ‚Äúyo let‚Äôs see if I‚Äôm gonna find love this weekend‚Äù üòÜüíã Both are valid!

What matters most is: are you getting something out of it that feels helpful, healing, or hopeful? üåàüßø If the answer‚Äôs yes, then hey ‚Äî let the skeptics roll their eyes üëÅÔ∏è whatever. Not everything magical has to make sense to everyone ‚úåÔ∏èüòå

Bottom line: psychic readings are what *you* make of them. You can take it lightly or take it seriously. But either way, they‚Äôve helped a lot of people feel less lost and more in control üí™üåå

So yeah, don‚Äôt knock it till you try it üòâüîÆ Whether you‚Äôre in it for laughs or for life clarity... it might just surprise you. üí≠üíú

Got a question on your mind? Something bugging your heart? Go get a reading üÉè‚ú® sometimes the universe whispers through a card, a dream, or a stranger. You never know where that little nudge might lead... üë£üåô

Stay curious üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è stay magical üêâ and stay true to your vibe üí´",0,1748387860.0,ClairvoyantPsychic,0,0.5,False

Picture a sleepy, suburban street where the most exciting thing that ever happens is someone‚Äôs Amazon package gets delivered a day late. I moved here three years ago, always minding my own business‚Äîand my parking space. That space, right in front of my townhouse, is a sacred strip of asphalt that I have protected more fiercely than any driveway in America.

Enter my neighbor, ‚ÄúDave.‚Äù Dave with the always-too-loud truck and the TikTok-famous dog (no, really, the dog has more followers than I do). For some reason, Dave‚Äôs two-car driveway isn‚Äôt enough for his collection of beaters and ‚Äúproject vehicles.‚Äù One morning I come out and my spot is taken. By Dave‚Äôs ‚Äúnew‚Äù (read: ancient and leaky) pickup. I knock, politely ask him not to do it again. He shrugs, says ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a spot.‚Äù For weeks, Dave rotates his cars through my space like he‚Äôs running a valet service out of my life.

So, I take the high road. I leave friendly notes. I bake cookies and attach them to the notes (gluten free, just in case). I even hand-write a letter, outlining parking etiquette with an included diagram. Each time, my spot is still taken. I call the city and learn there‚Äôs nothing they can do because it‚Äôs technically not ‚Äúassigned.‚Äù But this is war, and I am a soldier armed with caramel blondies and passive-aggressive Post-Its.

That‚Äôs when inspiration strikes. I get up at dawn, parade my recycling bins from the garage to the curb, lined perfectly along the space. I spend every morning in a camping chair right on the edge of my spot, sipping coffee and reading the local paper, ignoring Dave‚Äôs confused stares. Eventually, he stops. Our street returns to peace, my parking spot sacred once more. And just as I lean back, triumphant, my chair and I are abducted by a group of hyper-intelligent flamingos from Neptune, who needed a new expert on parallel parking for their intergalactic HOA tribunal.",1,1748387737.0,u_KarenAteMyDad,0,1.0,False

Today was the first time I had coffee while taking it and I feel SUPER jittery and wired, sort of hyper aware of everything. I drink a lot of coffee normally so it doesn‚Äôt usually make me feel like this, has anyone else experienced this? 

I‚Äôm considering just cutting coffee out (I know coffee is bad for anxiety which is the reason I started on the Zoloft, so was considering cutting back anyways) but the tiredness and fatigue has been a lot to deal with, I‚Äôve been sleeping so much and still feel pretty drained.

Aside from that I have felt a bit of other symptoms that I had been warned about such as some nausea, some jaw clenching and sooo much yawning, but after reading some posts here I‚Äôm hopeful that these side effects will subside after a while. I love coffee but the decreased anxiety and racing thoughts would be worth going cold turkey if it makes me feel so strange, but I think the meds are also making me feel strange lol

If anyone has experienced this did you end up cutting out caffeine or did the effect subside after a while?

Hi Reddit,
English isn‚Äôt my first language, so please excuse any mistakes.

I‚Äôm a 22-year-old woman. I was raised by my grandparents (grandma 83, grandpa 94) until I was 9. Then my mom took me and my younger sister back to live with her. Life with my mom was a nightmare. She was extremely abusive‚Äîphysically and emotionally. She yelled constantly, never let us speak our minds, and beat me often. She always favored my sister and literally called me the devil and my sister the angel in front of other people, like it was a joke.

That‚Äôs not even the story I want to share, but some background is necessary.

Even after moving in with my mom, I stayed very close to my grandparents. I‚Äôd spend weekends and holidays with them, and I always helped around the house. Honestly, I did most of the chores on my own. My grandfather is quite controlling, so whenever my mom or uncles felt overwhelmed, they‚Äôd just send me over to ""distract"" him. None of them would help my grandma with anything‚Äîdoctor‚Äôs appointments, cleaning, etc.‚Äîbut I always showed up. No one forced me. I just loved them and felt responsible.

I‚Äôve never claimed to be a perfect child. I‚Äôve struggled a lot mentally over the years, but I‚Äôve worked hard to get better. I used to have a stealing habit as a child (especially food), which I developed partly because I was constantly falsely accused of stealing money growing up. My mom would beat me until I ‚Äúconfessed‚Äù even when I was innocent, only to find the money later and never apologize. It happened so many times, and over time, I did end up stealing during middle school‚Äîbut I stopped when I was around 14 and have never done it since.

I now have a job, go to school, and pay for my own needs. But even now, occasionally, someone in my family will still randomly accuse me of stealing.

Today something happened that absolutely broke me.

I stopped by my grandparents‚Äô place (as usual, in a rush between classes and work) to help out. Out of nowhere, my grandmother accused me of stealing money. She grabbed my bag and emptied it, yelling at me to return the money so she wouldn't tell anyone . She‚Äôs never done this before. She‚Äôs always been my safe space. I was so shocked I cried, swearing I didn‚Äôt take anything. I even told her to go ahead and tell my mom, knowing how badly that could end for me‚Äîbut I also knew they wouldn‚Äôt find anything because I didn‚Äôt do it.
Oh
She just kept yelling, insisting I give it back. Then suddenly‚Ä¶ silence. A bit later, she told me to ‚Äúgather my things.‚Äù Then she just sat with me in the kitchen like nothing had happened, offering me coffee. Oh and the weirdest part ?? When I asked her to tell my mom she threatened that she'd never talk to me or forgive me if i tell her ( it was my only way to prove my innocence )

I‚Äôve been awake for 7 hours now, unable to sleep or cry. I feel numb. It shattered my heart. I always thought of them as the only people I could truly count on. I showed up for them constantly‚Äîeven when no one else did‚Äîand they accused me like I was some thief who dropped by to steal their money.

Now I‚Äôm seriously thinking about going no contact. But I also feel incredibly guilty‚Äîthey‚Äôre so old. What if they die and I wasn‚Äôt there? I don‚Äôt know how to deal with this. I can‚Äôt keep putting myself in situations where I‚Äôm treated like this, even by people I love.

If anyone has been through something similar, please share your experience. I just feel really alone in this.

Many politicians vanished from the public eye after the first burnings.

Intelligence agencies had already delivered the truth:

This was no hoax ‚Äî it was law.

A law that no title, no faith, no rank could defy.



But there was one institution where fear arrived more slowly.

One that had hidden for centuries behind the veil of piety.

One that had mastered the art of lying better than anyone.



Religion.



And today...

The Vatican.



The day began like any other.

Robed clerics shuffled through the halls.

Candles were lit, floors swept, whispers of prayers dissolved into the cold stone.

Nuns bent in morning service beneath the shadows of marble columns.

Cardinals exchanged gossip, whispered intrigues ‚Äî who to pressure, which bishop to replace, where to ‚Äúexpand true faith.‚Äù



‚Äî We‚Äôve nearly secured the council in Quito, ‚Äî said one.

‚Äî Just need to approve the new coordinator, ‚Äî replied another.

‚Äî The main thing is to keep those bastards from the East out...



Their conversation was cut short when a man burst into the hall ‚Äî from the Segreteria di Stato, the Secretariat of State.

But he wasn‚Äôt just a messenger.

He was a harbinger of alarm ‚Äî the kind who only appears when something colossal is about to collapse.



He ran.

And on his face ‚Äî terror. Pure. Seared in. Unmistakable.



‚Äî Eminenze... ‚Äî he gasped. ‚Äî You‚Ä¶ you need to see this. Immediately.



The cardinals exchanged glances ‚Äî slowly, reluctantly.

But when he repeated:



‚Äî It‚Äôs above us.

‚Äî Over St. Peter‚Äôs Square‚Ä¶

‚Äî A being. It‚Äôs hanging in the sky.

‚Äî And it‚Äôs happening all over the world.



They rushed to the windows.

Then ‚Äî to the balconies.



And they saw it.



Above the grand plaza ‚Äî the place where pilgrims gathered, where the Pope spoke, where armies were blessed and children baptized ‚Äî

hung a figure.



A black suit.

No visible face.

The air around it was frozen.

Physics no longer applied.

Reality bent to him.



‚Äî What kind of devil‚Äôs trick is this? ‚Äî whispered one cardinal.

‚Äî Illusion? A hologram...?

‚Äî Heresy. A demon. Satan. Herod...



But none of them spoke further.

Because down below stood thousands of people.

All staring upward.



And then‚Ä¶

a voice.



Not from loudspeakers.

From within.



It spoke in every language.

The same sentence.

Cold. Calm. Without tone or emotion.

But to each listener ‚Äî it sounded familiar.



‚Äî First rule.

‚Äî Lies no longer exist.



A moment of silence.

And then‚Ä¶ panic.



One person ‚Äî burst into blue flames.

A scream.

A shriek.

Above them, words appeared in the air:



""Said he didn‚Äôt steal church donations. Lied.""



Another ‚Äî a few steps away.

Also ignited.

Floating above:



""Seduced a novice. Denied it.""



Cries.

The crowd tried to flee, but the flames didn‚Äôt spread like a plague.

They spread like questions.

One by one.

Slowly. Relentlessly.



The security aide, the one who had brought the cardinals, stood frozen.

Snapping out of his daze, he reached for his radio.



‚Äî We need to get them out! Now!



They fled deeper into the basilica.

Down corridors, through chambers, behind marble doors.

But ‚Äî fire on the right.

Fire on the left.



Blue tongues of flame.

Familiar faces.

The archivist. The abbot. The old bishop.



And above each ‚Äî a sentence.



""Lied about a prophecy. Served fear, not faith.""



Outside, the square had become a purgatory.

Those who lied ‚Äî burned.

Those who were silent ‚Äî wept.

Some fell to their knees, praying.

Others whispered in disbelief:



""This can‚Äôt be happening.""

""That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not God.""



But above them all ‚Äî

He hovered.

Silent.

Watching.



Chapter 9: Holy Hell (continued)

Scene I ‚Äî Rome



Rome.

Clear skies.

Above the basilica‚Äôs dome ‚Äî white clouds, like brushstrokes on a saint's icon.

Untouched by shadow.



But in St. Peter‚Äôs Square, it was already different.

Where usually whispers of prayer rose with the bells,

there were now screams.

Different ones.

Sharp. Hoarse. Silent.



The crowd broke apart.



Some ran in terror, stumbling, losing shoes, children, sanity.

Others dashed between souvenir stalls, looking for shelter beneath flimsy tents.

Some pressed against storefronts, as if glass could protect from the absolute.



But not everyone ran.



Some ‚Äî walked.

Slowly.

With wide pupils and lowered arms, muttering prayers.



They weren‚Äôt fleeing fear.

They were walking ‚Äî toward faith.



They dropped to their knees right there on the sunbaked stone.

Some in designer suits, clutching cameras.

Others barefoot, with dirty hands and tear-swollen eyes.



They looked upward.



To where It hovered.



They crossed themselves ‚Äî with desperation.

As if a gesture could rewrite the past.

They struck their chests.

They whispered:



""Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me...""



They prayed.

Hands folded, elbows on the ground, faces buried in stone.



But sadly‚Ä¶

This was not God.



This was something else.

Something that had rewritten reality.

It had not come to save.

It had come to expose.



It did not offer a choice.

It named the price ‚Äî for every lie, every ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù every ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù every ‚Äúwe never lie.‚Äù



It broke no laws.

It created new ones.



And with every moment, it became clearer:

To pray to it‚Ä¶

was to beg the executioner to bless the axe.



And still, they prayed.



Because it was easier.

Because no one knew what else to do.



Scene II ‚Äî Behind Closed Doors



Outside ‚Äî the crowd shattered.

Inside ‚Äî a heavy silence.



Deep within the Vatican, beneath carved arches and frescoed ceilings,

in an old crisis chamber known as Aula Silencio,

three men sat.



Three cardinals.

Three pillars.

The ones who always knew what to say.

But not today.



The door was locked behind them.

Swiss Guards stood outside.

Phones ‚Äî disconnected.

Screens ‚Äî glowing with live feeds from around the world.



‚ÄúAbove every capital,‚Äù whispered Archbishop Orlando Sepriani.

‚ÄúThe same figure.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe same phrase.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe same result.‚Äù



He was the oldest.

His hands didn‚Äôt tremble from age ‚Äî but from the unknown.

He had buried popes. Presided over conclaves.

He had passed judgments.

But now he sat like a student before an exam that could not be studied for.



‚ÄúThis... is impossible,‚Äù said Cardinal Luis Portelli,

a heavy man with a face carved from basalt.



He clutched his rosary, but no prayers would form.

The beads slipped through his fingers like sand.



‚ÄúEverything is possible,‚Äù said the third.

Raphael Marcelli ‚Äî young, charismatic, a man of cameras.

He wasn‚Äôt praying.

He was watching.



‚ÄúAnything is possible‚Ä¶ when fear is involved,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúAnd fear...‚Äù

He paused.

‚ÄúFear makes us vulnerable.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd it makes them ‚Äî controllable.‚Äù



He pointed at the screen.



There was the square.

People praying.

People burning.



Among them ‚Äî some still standing.

Staring.

Doing nothing.



‚ÄúThat is not God,‚Äù Portelli muttered.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a demon. A provocation. The antichrist.‚Äù



‚ÄúWho decides what God is?‚Äù Marcelli asked quietly, not turning his head.

‚ÄúYou? Or the one whose words become reality?‚Äù



Sepriani raised a hand ‚Äî cutting the tension.



‚ÄúQuiet.‚Äù



He gestured at a new broadcast.

Tokyo.



Live footage: rockets rising.

One. Then two. Then six.



Silence.



They watched.

Darkness turned into fire.



Flash.

Explosion.

The sky shook.



The cardinals froze.



‚ÄúIs he‚Ä¶ destroyed?‚Äù whispered Portelli.



No one answered.



The feed trembled.

Ash.

Flame.

No figure.



‚ÄúWhat now‚Ä¶?‚Äù murmured Marcelli.

‚ÄúMaybe‚Ä¶‚Äù



And then ‚Äî in the corner of the room

a fire ignited.



Blue.

No smoke.

No heat.

Silent.



A man caught fire.



It was a young assistant from the archives, who had stood quietly in the back.

He made coffee. Sorted schedules. Ran errands.



Now he stood ‚Äî ablaze.

Still.

Not screaming.



Above his head ‚Äî glowing words:



‚ÄúSaid he was in the archives.

In truth ‚Äî was hiding.‚Äù



The cardinals recoiled.



‚ÄúWho asked the question?‚Äù croaked Sepriani.



‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I did,‚Äù whispered Marcelli.

‚ÄúI just asked where he was while we were waiting.‚Äù



Silence.



And only the fire remained.





Chapter 10: The Walls Tremble





Scene I ‚Äî Japanese Parliament, Tokyo



Tokyo.

Parliament building.

A hall with a massive oval table, walls of dark wood, large screens broadcasting live footage: fiery skies over the city, explosions, journalists' screams.



In the hall ‚Äî about 12 people.

Ministers, generals, members of the national security council.



Secretaries along the walls ‚Äî pale, some trembling.

Some watch the screen.

Others cover their faces with their hands.



Suddenly ‚Äî a loud bang.

The door swings open forcefully.



Enter Kenjiro Hirayama ‚Äî

Minister of Defense.

One of the oldest and most influential politicians in the country.

Legendary, grim, with a piercing voice that usually spoke softly, but not today.



Behind him ‚Äî security, advisors, a woman in a strict suit holding a folder.



He explodes:



‚Äî Who the hell gave that order?!



Silence.



He glances at the screen: missiles ‚Äî launch, target, impact.

He looks back at them.



‚Äî Are you out of your minds?

‚Äî You ordered an attack on the city?!

‚Äî Live on air!?

‚Äî How the hell are we going to explain this?!



A voice from the corner:



‚Äî It was... General Naomi.

‚Äî Under the directive of the council chairman... Mori Kazuhiro.



A moment of silence.

All eyes turn to Kazuhiro ‚Äî

A new-wave politician, cold, one who builds a career on crises.



He stands.

Calmly.



‚Äî We had no other choice.

‚Äî It was a decision of the military cabinet.

‚Äî He posed a threat to national security.



Hirayama:



‚Äî He!? That entity?!

‚Äî He didn't attack a single building.

‚Äî He didn't even... move!



Someone interjects:



‚Äî He burned people... just for lying.



Another attendee interrupts:



‚Äî And if tomorrow it says that thinking is a sin?

‚Äî Will we sit and stay silent then?



Woman with a tablet:



‚Äî The USA, China, France, and India... haven't attacked yet.

‚Äî We're the first. And the whole world... is already watching us.





Scene II ‚Äî Cracks from Within



Same hall.

Doors still closed.

Silence after the explosion.

Only the hum of the screen.



Hirayama stands by the window, fists clenched.



Voices in the Japanese parliament hall begin to tremble.



Then one of the attendees, Shingo Yasuda,

Rises from the table, eyes gleaming.

He's trembling, but with excitement:



‚Äî You don't understand...

‚Äî This isn't an enemy.

‚Äî It's an angel.

‚Äî An angel of purification!

‚Äî Can't you see? He punishes lies! Isn't that sacred?!



‚Äî Are you out of your mind? ‚Äî yells Hina Shizuko.

‚Äî We just attacked him over Tokyo. If this is God ‚Äî we're already dead!



Yasuda walks to the center of the hall, hands clasped in prayer:



‚Äî So be it!

‚Äî We prayed for signs! He is the sign!



Ryo Aoba moves away from the table, backing towards the wall.



‚Äî We're... next.

‚Äî I feel it.

‚Äî He... knows. Knows everyone.



On the screen ‚Äî a square in Paris, someone begins to burn.



Saito (general) breathes heavily.

He speaks quietly for the first time:



‚Äî We made the first strike.

‚Äî If he's not human... he won't forget.



And silence falls.



Scene III ‚Äî He Didn't Disappear



Parliament.

Same hall.

The screen's light dims, and a new broadcast appears ‚Äî the camera shakes, microphone noise.

...the camera slightly jolts.

Focus lost.



On the screen ‚Äî Tokyo.

Thick smoke, like a vortex, swirls on the horizon.

Large buildings ‚Äî in a gray haze.

People on the streets ‚Äî some silent, some trembling, some already on their knees.



And suddenly ‚Äî silence.



From the smoke, as if from a crack in the sky, he emerged.



Same figure.

Same silence.

No soot, no signs of damage.

He simply ‚Äî returned.



A heaviness hung over Tokyo.

As if gravity itself trembled.



In the Japanese parliament hall ‚Äî silence.

Someone slowly sank into a chair.

Someone covered their face with their hands.

Someone just stared. Unblinking.



On the screen ‚Äî him.

Hovering, as if nothing happened.

As if the explosion never occurred.

As if it was all just a rehearsal.



Aoba whispers:



He hovers again in the air, in the same place where the strike just occurred.

As if... nothing happened.



The hall remains ‚Äî silent...



Aoba whispers again:



‚Äî This is impossible...



Shizuko frantically taps on the tablet, eyes darting over the data.



‚Äî No pulsation. No thermal signature. No gravitational shift.

‚Äî He just... exists.



Yasuda falls to his knees in the hall. Right onto the carpet.



‚Äî Hallelujah...

‚Äî He has risen.

‚Äî He has forgiven.

‚Äî He gave us a sign...



Hirayama recoils from the screen, horrified:



‚Äî Forgiven?

‚Äî He's playing with us!

‚Äî This isn't mercy ‚Äî it's a demonstration of power!



Kazuhiro (cold politician) still stands by the table.



He calmly watches the screen.



‚Äî He showed us that we are ‚Äî helpless.

‚Äî And now everyone will lie to his face... silently.



He sits. For the first time during the entire time.

As if realizing there's no point in standing anymore.



On the screen:



People in Tokyo ‚Äî begin to bow.

Some ‚Äî fall to their knees.

Someone ‚Äî raises their hands upward.



Scene IV ‚Äî The Gaze



The sky over Tokyo ‚Äî dark, but without a storm.

He said nothing.

No gesture. No sign.



Just ‚Äî looked down.



Even those who didn't believe fell to their knees.

The streets became quieter than a temple.

And over the city ‚Äî something hung.

Not fear. Not reverence.



Expectation.



The kind that presses harder than any truth.

Expectation... of a new word.



But he remained silent.



He simply was.

Like a shadow from the heavens.

Like a mystery no one dares to unravel first.



And below, among the crowd, someone wept ‚Äî

not from fear,

but because

silence is scarier than punishment.",1,1748386724.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
