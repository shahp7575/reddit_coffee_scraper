Hey Calgary Reddit! 👋

I just made the leap from the skyscrapers of Toronto to the stunning skyline (and actual sky) of Calgary. So far, I’m loving the fresh air, chill vibes, and the insane mountain views that make the CN Tower look like a lego set.

About me:
📍 30-ish, city guy learning to be outdoorsy
🍕 Can debate Toronto vs. Calgary pizza without starting a war (maybe)
🎶 Into music, film, hikes, and late-night deep talks over wine or coffee
💻 Work in tech / creative industry — so yes, I can probably fix your Wi-Fi 😄

I'm here to meet cool people, get to know the city beyond just Stephen Ave and the Bow River path, and maybe connect with someone who's got a spare pair of hiking boots and a soft spot for sarcastic humor.

So — what’s something every Calgarian should do at least once? Or where’s the best place to catch a sunset with a view and no crowds?

DMs are open if you're down for a city explorer turned mountain rookie 🏞️

Would you like it to sound more flirty, more humorous, or more serious/professional? I can tailor it to match your vibe better.",1,1748393773.0,u_karan_437,0,1.0,False

So to start this off quick, i got out of an abusive relationship with my ex gf of about 2 years, around 3 weeks ago. i had a very anxious attatchment to her but i finally got out of the cycle by hooking up with my friend and it helped me detach greatly.

Now, i kind of butchered that FWB situation because i caught feelings. I told my friend i had to cut her off because she didn’t want to progress like i did in terms of a relationship and I was scared of getting hurt from my trauma with my ex. This happened like 3 days ago

I hit her up again yesterday to see if i could call her, she didn’t answer but called about 8 hours later but i didn’t see it. today i texted her why i wanted to talk because i feel bad, i had to ghost her for a year bc of my ex. And now I basically just said im leaving her right as we started talking again. It is selfish of me because at the end of the day, she does like me, and i am important to her life . It’s not fair to her that I can just come and go as i please. I just reacted how i would to protect myself. So i texted her that i didn’t want to do that to her again and if we could meet up for coffee so we could talk. she hasn’t answered, which i really don’t blame her at all. She has every right to not put up with me coming and going it just sucks because i don’t mean to act like this I just can’t go through what i went through again. 

So now that she’s not answering I’m just being anxious and having trouble being alone, I haven’t been single for more than a month since i was 16, i’m 23 now. and had 2 long term relationships, so as you can assume I haven’t really been alone in 6 years through my whole life of maturing. I matured with someone in my life since i was a teen so this is all scary to me. I know i need to be alone, sometimes it’s fine, but some days it really just kicks my ass. I know i need to be single but when im alone and things aren’t going my way my anxiety kicks in and i feel like i need someone to fill in that void. I know this is a lot to take in. But if anyone could give me advice on my friend, their takes on the situation. Especially how to manage being alone. It would help me greatly.

Pleaseee refrain from calling me mean names because of my friend lol. I’m already self aware that what i did is fucked up and inconsiderate. ",1,1748393634.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1kx3ujc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BooMeRx_1/comments/1kx3ujc/best_portable_bluetooth_speakers_my_picks_thoughts/,Best Portable Bluetooth Speakers (My Picks + Thoughts),"Hey Reddit,

After spending way too much time researching, watching reviews, and reading spec sheets, I decided to just dive in and **test six well-known portable Bluetooth speakers** for myself. I was looking for something that could handle day-to-day use, outdoor hangs, and maybe the occasional beach trip — basically, a great all-around speaker that didn’t compromise too much on sound or build.

Here are the speakers I tested:

* Bose SoundLink Flex
* JBL Xtreme 2
* Marshall Middleton
* JBL PartyBox Encore
* Anker Soundcore Motion Boom Plus
* EarFun UBOOM L

If you're on the fence about any of these, I hope this post gives you some real-world insights. I used each speaker for at least 1–2 weeks in different scenarios — indoors, outdoors, low volume, max volume, solo listening, small gatherings — to get a balanced impression.

# [1. Bose SoundLink Flex](https://www.yourtechbuddies.com/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers/#1)

**First Impressions:**  
Compact, classy, and exactly what you'd expect from Bose in terms of build quality. It feels premium but also rugged, with a soft-touch exterior and an IP67 waterproof rating.

**Sound:**  
Extremely clean and balanced. Vocals and mids are where this speaker shines. It doesn’t overwhelm you with bass, but what’s there is tight and controlled. Great for acoustic, pop, jazz, or podcasts. Not for bass heads.

**Portability:**  
A+ here — super lightweight, easy to toss into a bag, and even has a fabric loop for hanging.

**Battery:**  
I got around 10–11 hours at moderate volume.

**Drawbacks:**  
No stereo pairing with older SoundLinks. Also, no aux input, which is a minor annoyance.

**Verdict:**  
If you want a **small, elegant speaker with clean sound**, and don’t need wall-shaking bass, the SoundLink Flex delivers. Ideal for personal listening or quiet settings.

# [ 2. JBL Xtreme 2](https://www.yourtechbuddies.com/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers/#2)

**First Impressions:**  
This thing is a tank. It comes with a strap, and you’ll want it — it's not light. But it screams durability, and it can take a beating.

**Sound:**  
Bass-heavy, no surprise here. Dual passive radiators on the sides push out some serious low-end. It’s fun and loud, but occasionally, the mids feel a bit recessed, especially at higher volumes.

**Portability:**  
Stretching the word “portable” here. It’s more like “transportable.” You *can* carry it in a backpack, but it’s going to take up space and add weight.

**Battery:**  
Solid — around 15 hours. Also charges devices via USB out.

**Drawbacks:**  
Not the most detailed sound. Definitely tuned for party volume over fidelity. No USB-C charging.

**Verdict:**  
The Xtreme 2 is a **powerhouse for outdoor use or small gatherings**. Not the best for subtle listening, but it dominates for casual bassy fun. You’ll want this for picnics, not piano recitals.

# [ 3. Marshall Middleton](https://www.yourtechbuddies.com/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers/#3)

**First Impressions:**  
Arguably the best-looking speaker I tested. Has a classic amp vibe with textured finish and brass knobs. It’s got style and substance.

**Sound:**  
Surprisingly detailed and rich. Very balanced profile — strong bass, but not boomy, crisp highs, and warm mids. Sounds great across genres, and doesn’t distort at higher volumes. Definitely the most “audiophile-ish” tuning of the bunch.

**Portability:**  
Mid-sized, about the size of a chunky book. A bit heavy, but not unmanageable.

**Battery:**  
20+ hours — great endurance.

**Extras:**  
Has an app with a customizable EQ, and the physical knobs are actually usable for adjusting sound and volume.

**Drawbacks:**  
Price. It’s not cheap, and not everyone will prioritize the vintage look or brand cachet.

**Verdict:**  
If you care about **aesthetic AND great sound**, the Middleton hits a sweet spot. Pricey, but justifies it with quality across the board.

# [4. JBL PartyBox Encore](https://www.yourtechbuddies.com/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers/#4)

**First Impressions:**  
Huge. Loud. Flashy. Definitely built for events, not coffee shop corners. It even comes with a wireless mic for karaoke.

**Sound:**  
Booming and bass-heavy, with clear highs and enough volume to fill a backyard. It’s less about nuance and more about vibe. It performs best outdoors where it has room to breathe.

**Lights:**  
The LED light ring is fun, especially in low-light settings. Purely aesthetic, but it adds to the energy.

**Battery:**  
Roughly 10 hours — fair considering the output.

**Portability:**  
Calling this “portable” is a stretch. You *can* move it, but it’s bulky and heavy. Think rolling suitcase, not travel bag.

**Verdict:**  
If you want to throw a **mobile party**, this is a beast. Great for events, but definitely overkill for most casual users.

# [ 5. Anker Motion Boom Plus](https://www.yourtechbuddies.com/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers/#5)

**First Impressions:**  
Anker’s been killing it with budget-friendly gear, and this speaker is no exception. Feels tough, IP67 waterproof, and even floats.

**Sound:**  
Loud, punchy, and full. The bass is strong (especially for the price), and it holds up surprisingly well at higher volumes. The highs can be a little sharp out of the box, but the app lets you EQ that down easily.

**Battery:**  
20+ hours! Unreal for the price.

**Portability:**  
It’s not tiny, but has a carry strap and is still much lighter than JBL’s Xtreme or PartyBox.

**Drawbacks:**  
Slightly plasticky build. Not as refined as the Middleton or Bose, but not a dealbreaker. Default tuning is a bit aggressive.

**Verdict:**  
This is the **value king**. Loud, long-lasting, waterproof, and cheap — what more could you want? A must-buy for budget-conscious bass lovers.

# [6. EarFun UBOOM L](https://www.yourtechbuddies.com/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers/#6)

**First Impressions:**  
Very compact, matte finish, and has a simple design. Looks clean and minimal. Definitely the most “grab-and-go” option here.

**Sound:**  
Surprisingly capable. You’re not getting crazy bass, but it holds its own. Vocals are clear, bass is respectable at medium volumes, and it doesn’t distort easily.

**Portability:**  
Super light, water-resistant, and easy to toss in a bag.

**Battery:**  
About 14–16 hours, which is impressive for the size.

**Drawbacks:**  
Can’t compete with the big boys in bass or fullness. But it’s not trying to.

**Verdict:**  
If you want something **cheap, light, and good enough**, the UBOOM L is awesome. Great for casual listening or travel. It’s not a party speaker, but it punches above its weight.

You start a new job at a sleek, cutting-edge biotech company.  
The kind of place that makes you think you’ve *finally made it*—modern building, glass walls, endless coffee, and a salary that almost makes you forget the pressure.

But within weeks, the cracks start to show.  
Your projects are mysteriously reassigned.  
Your login credentials stop working—without explanation.  
Coworkers give you polite smiles, but when you turn your back, the whispers start.  
You try to speak up, but suddenly, **you’re the problem**.  
Management gaslights you. HR says there’s no record of your concerns.

And then…  
Your phone glitches at night—calls from unknown numbers.  
You catch glimpses of documents on your screen that vanish before you can read them.  
Security cameras follow your every move, but when you ask about it, they say **you’re imagining things**.  
Even your own computer fights against you—emails disappearing, files locked.  
The worst part? You start to question your own sanity.

This is the world of **Elara Cross**.  
A woman who thought she was just starting a new job at a biotech firm called **AioGenetics**—but who stumbled into something much bigger.  
**Much darker.**

Because AioGenetics isn’t just a company.  
It’s part of a **larger machine**—an invisible system of **power, deception, and control**.

They want you to **obey**.  
To accept the rules without question.  
To be grateful for the paycheck while they decide who climbs, who falls, and who vanishes completely.

And when you resist?  
They use every tool in their arsenal to crush you—**workplace sabotage, gaslighting, digital manipulation, social isolation**—until you either fall in line or become a ghost in the system.

But Elara doesn’t fall in line.  
She starts to pull the threads.  
And that’s when she discovers the **Shadow Mandate**:  
A hidden, sprawling conspiracy that controls far more than her job.  
It decides who gets hired, who gets fired, who gets harassed into submission—and who never makes it home.

It’s not just her company.  
It’s connected to **other corporations**, **government agencies**, and **shadow networks** that use surveillance, psychological warfare, and AI manipulation to control lives.

I was the one who broke the silence by saying “so what do you want talk about” he goes and “says I don’t know. I have nothing to say and I don’t know what you were expecting me to say”. I said “your the one who called me saying u wanted to talk and said I wouldn’t cry in the cafe” which by the way I did. then he goes and says “well if I’m being honest I forgot I even rang you”. I was so crushed and mad I said to him “just take me home”. then another 2 weeks pass, he starts texting me more asking how am I and stuff. which i thought was weird, so being polite I say “how are you doing?” he says “I’m stressed” I say “is it because of work?” and he says “everything”, but because I was still angry I replied “well if ur stressed about us it’s ur own fault” then he goes on to being like “I know I’m sorry. I’m so stupid. I lied when I said I forgot out ringing you to go get coffee and I don’t know why I did” and everything, so out of sympathy I said “do you want to talk?” he said yes, but things have happened which I’m not going go into, but it’s delayed our “talk” and now he’s gone back to ignoring my messages and I feel like he’s Change his mind again and I just don’t know what do. why is he messing me about like this?

1kx3qzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffGridCabins/comments/1kx3qzs/offgrid_power_improvements/,Off-Grid Power Improvements,"Hey everyone,

I have a pretty common off-grid power situation but have recently been toying with the idea of improving the situation and wanted to see if anyone out there had ideas on the subject.

We (my family) have a cabin with no realistic hope of getting electricity.  We have been using gasoline generators for 40 years to generate the power we need, we're on generator #3.  However, that is obviously fairly pricey and we also have community time-of-day rules and all that good stuff.  

We run 20-25 light bulbs, a coffee pot, a toaster, a TV/DVD and a 240 Volt well pump.  I'd like to come up with a solution that would allow Star Link, which would then add potential for phones, laptops, and that kind of thing.

Question #1:  
\- I have no idea how much power we actually draw off of that generator  
\- I'd like to baseline it but don't know how???  
\- How can I measure that traffic?

I can't stop thinking about how much we are wasting, but maybe, we're not, I don't know.  That generator has 2 speeds, idle and at RPM.  This means if I power a light bulb, I'm wasting 4900 Watts - I think.  This has lead me to think about other solutions.

Solar:  
I've already priced this out, and for our electrical footprint, it's simply not cost-effective.  Plus there are several other factors such as snow depth and things like that.

Batteries:  
This lead me to think about a battery vault with a bus switch.  But I don't know how much I could run off a battery bank, how many, or what type of batteries, to get, or logistical challenges like an unattended cabin for several weeks at a time.  I like the idea of a vault, that we could dig into ground and concrete it in.

Anyway, any help here would be appreciated.  Anyone have any experience in these type of issues?  I've included a couple of very rough drawings - this seems like a pretty simple idea as just don't know if the juice is worth the squeeze.  For Star Link though, we really need a more permanent power source.",1,1748393002.0,OffGridCabins,1,1.0,False
1kx3qlo,https://www.reddit.com/r/MigratorModel/comments/1kx3qlo/a_look_at_the_issues_of_the_proposed_oumuamua/,A Look at the Issues of the proposed Oumuamua - Boyajian Star 'Signal' (Update 2025 May 28),"I think I may have noted the perihelion date for Oumuamua being the same as the Angkor dip for Tabby's star a little back, but concluded it was more likely to be coincidence. Then when I became of Hibberd's modelling of Oumuamua's trajectory, where perigee fell on the same date, I thought it intriguing enough to warrant a 'Migrator Model' academic download - but even then flagged I doubted Oumuamua would become a key part of my 'proto-hypothesis'. Then when I experimented with Hibberd's 171.2 beta angle for Oumuamua, prompted after presenting the finding Sacco's orbit appeared to be trigonometric, the findings were simply astonishing. Oumuamua is definitely a key strand of the Migrator Model now - though not quite as Avi Loeb's ETI solar sail, rather as a 'signal' vessel. The 171.2 beta angle appears to 'affirm' the sectorial blocks of the template (my proposed asteroid mining sector division) and even appears to unlock the structure of Angkor's standard dip signifier (4176) with clean routes to Earth's sidereal orbit and Sacco's orbit for Tabby's star. So first I'll lay out the proposition, and then look at some of its weak points.

**Proposition -**

We know the galaxy is very old (in a sense, on its last legs with most of the stars dying or dead). This could mean a highly advanced and stable ETI could have millions of years on us. The ETI would have its own vested interests in harvesting resources from star systems it has colonised and keep a sharp eye out for new kids on the block (Earth as a big blue dot would stick out a mile as a candidate). Now though an established species might have potentially millions of years of technological development - a newcomer like our species might still be a threat if technological progress slows down at certain thresholds (akin to the way data mining in crypto currencies takes ever longer computing time). However, just as we have nature reserves, an advanced ETI might give an emerging intelligent species time - and to see how it turns out. If the species behaves in a stable fashion as it pushes out into space, particularly when it comes to sharing resources - it will have passed the test of natural selection and the ETI will know there is a good chance of stable relations. However, if the new species is incapable of cooperating with its own disparate factions (nations) and warring over the assets of its Moon or the asteroid field - while at the same time developing ever more deadly space vessels and weaponry - the ETI might decide the risk of tolerating the equivalent of a drunken teenager in charge of an AI honed war machine, is simply too great and exercise the ultimate sanction before a given technological threshold is reached. So how would an ETI signal to us its seniority and give both a chance for 'contact' and a warning?

The core premise of the Migrator Model as that the dust dips are superfine mill tailings (dust waste) of massive industrial asteroid harvesting. The activity is in an industrial orbit safely away from the ecliptic. The secondary proposition is that the ETI are using the waste to signal - Earth in particular. This would account for the scale of some of the dips (D1520 around 22% or 44 Jupiter-class gas giants eclipsing the star simultaneously - it's not a lot of dust, it's line of sight). Positioning the asteroid platforms (already in an artificial orbit) would not require a lot of resources. However, Boyajian's star at 1470 light years away would mean the signal was set up around 550 AD. Further, to know we are a metal-working species the ETI would have had to scan us around 900 - 1000 BC. Surely the ETI could not have calculated our technological development so accurately? Well, once the 'dust-signal' is up and running, the ETI could just keep it going - concluding that at some point (maybe many centuries or even many millennia either side of a predicted timeline) - wholesale harvesting of an asteroid field could take millennia (especially if needing resources to construct a Dyson swarm).

As a 'signal ambassador', Oumuamua would not likely have travelled directly from Tabby's star. More likely launched from a mother ship just outside the Solar system - the mother ship would know the timetable of dips for Tabby's star and, its sensors detecting growing space activity, dispatch Oumuamua to be timed for the Angkor dip. In one fell swoop, the ETI flags their seniority, that they are watching us closely, grooming us for contact and laying down the law of natural selection (if you are a functional species, we'll get on; if dysfunctional, you are a threat).

Well hey, why not just send a telecommunication, or laser signal - rather than such a weird set up? This question certainly exposes the weakest part of my proposition and to be honest, I'm not sure I can counter that point very strongly. However, here goes...

We as individuals do not live more than 100 years (and much of the latter years winding down). A signal spanning 3000 years of strategic spanning (on the surface) seems absurd. But this is because we are thinking anthropomorphically - a species with advanced science might have long overcome mortality (as we understand) and have incredibly long life spans (even the equivalent of immortality). 3000 years could be a coffee break to such a species. Further, as noted, the Tabby star dust dips as a signal would not cost much resources to set up. And of course an ETI would have an 'alien intelligence' - this means its choice of medium of communication might appear bewildering.

As for telecommunications,  believe SETI looked at Tabby's star and detected nothing indicating radio communications, and even optical flashes have been searched for. The obvious answer is that the ETI moved on long ago to other technologies (who knows: quantum resonance?). However, an advanced species should be able to 'dumb down' its technology and send a radio signal. The issue there is that the signal would have to be deciphered - and that could take time or even not work. An Oumuamua flyby is unambiguous and by arranging its perigee - perihelion and angle - all that needs to be said is said.

And if all propositions correct, what are they saying:

A) We're older and been around (we have seniority -we're not messing around, listen up)

B) We're asteroid miners - you will be too (if we deem you a stable species)

C) We will be back soon (tentative forecast: 2027 based on the dip signifier for Angkor)

My dog is dying. This is his fifth bout of pancreatitis and I can’t afford to treat it anymore. It cost at least 1000 every single time he goes. It’s been five times now he’s constantly sick. I’ve lost everything this year and I’m not depending on my family for help while I wait for disability. I had to pick up and move across the goddamn ocean so I can get some kind of mental health therapy and care. Everything is so hard the only help my family will give me is to put the dog down and he’s the only emotional support I have. I don’t have people I can call when things are hard. I don’t have that person who will go have a cup of coffee with me unless I can pretend I’m happy. People just come into my life to use me and then when they find other people they leave it doesn’t matter if it’s a friendship or a relationship my life is like a revolving door. Today he had another attack and I had to rush him to the vet. I know I have nothing left to even keep my phone on or pay my vehicle or eat this week. My family is putting pressure on me to put him down and I don’t have anything else This past year has been a let me know. I’ve lost everything I’ve ever known in my adult life. I had to leave somebody if I wouldn’t have left probably would’ve killed me and I’m starting again. And I try so hard. I try so goddamn hard and when I finally do break it down and reach out to people I get told by these assholes that what I really need are  friends to life and have fun with. Not them of course, but other people I can lay the burden on when that’s just not my reality. I can never tell people ever anything. That’s not positive or happy or they will go even faster. I feel like I literally need therapy every single day just to have someone to talk to to stay afloat And that’s not realistic and I don’t have the independent funds to make it happen. I exhaust myself traveling hours on the train to get to meet ups or go to groups and events and try to meet people. Even when I finally do make friends or feel like I belong in a group somewhere something happens where people can expose people can see there’s something wrong with me. Even when I can ignore even when I’m on my best behavior I’m still socially so awkward . I do stupid things like everybody goes on a hike and I get lost so they just leave without me. Like I can’t hide the learning disabilities. I can’t hide that I want to Spectrum even when I can hide the mental illness I can’t hide people never even stay long enough to see that I’m crazy because I’m already so fucking on in general, I can’t support myself. I can’t earn a
Living . The best I can out for is to get approved for this PIP so I can not have to be dependent on my family and avoid being. That’s as good as this is going to ever get and I’m tired. I even have people from my past that like to play games with me and come back when they’re bored and then later on if I don’t make a peep, then make a point of like smashing my head into the ground to remind me I’m not wanted in defective. It’s happened a couple times this year where people I’ve just people I thought would be around for a long time to just left. It’s not even just this one version it’s like an unworthy to anybody my life is suffering. And I’m sick of people‘s bullshit lectures that I just need to get out there and try harder they call me creepy they told me I was a stranger. I’ll always be that fucking creepy stranger that doesn’t even like I don’t even deserve to have someone to reach out to. Nobody wants to see or be around me either people flat out. Tell me I’m they dont  need anything out of me anymore and I have to go. Occasionally, I even get a nasty one who returns just to bully me remind me I’m unworthy and tell me I should kill myself. But it’s not even just her. It’s just like over and over and over I’m tired of having to just fucking let go after people are done using me. It’s like I’ve never allowed to have any like needs or wants of my own or even fucking sometimes need conversation or someone to hang out with You. Make one mistake as well just one and people they just shine  you. I can hide eventually ill, but I can’t hide the other things. I can’t hide im  awkward. The only answer is to withdraw and I do that until I can’t take anymore. I can’t. I have to be so careful to do anything with my deficits will come through even when I’m able to pretend I’m mentally stable. I get lost easily and I’m a horrible sense of direction which is gonna be a problem with my phone is shut off. I can’t mixed up on the trains, trying to find myself places and sometimes I end up late even when I leave hours earlier and people have no patience for that they just go without you. I suck in group activities that involve team sports because I’m clumsy. The only thing I can actually do and do well is make jokes out of it so no matter what happens to me how humiliated I am I can always make people have even a whole room full… About things I was crying about later. I have no other coping mechanisms.
I’m tired I’m angry and I’m alone and I can’t open myself up to anybody because I’ll either being ignored or told I deserve it . People have flat out, told me I should just kill myself
And they’re right . even my entire family hates me. Nobody wants to hear from me. Nobody wants to see me and everything is just so exhausting. The amount of work and time and distances. I have to travel just for any scrabble of socialization like I can’t fucking take anymore that’s not even down in the border. Why did I have to deal with every day in the bipolar people don’t understand what it’s like to hit a downward swing so bad you can’t fucking get out of bed. and if you force yourself to, you’ll be suicidal over the rest of the day.

Hey Reddit,

Life was... a lot. I’m a full-time caregiver, mom of three, and somehow the emotional support human for everyone around me. One day I looked at my run-down camper, my overgrown backyard, and thought, “What if I turned this into a peaceful escape—just for someone who needs it?”

Just kidding a lot more went in to it then that haha 😅 but you get it 

Fast forward a few months, a few hundred late-night DIY projects, and a whole lot of duct tape later... and Sip & Sage Co. was born.

It’s not a luxury resort. It’s not remote wilderness. But it is a carefully crafted, joy-sprinkled, bougie little oasis tucked into a quiet residential neighborhood in Southwest Florida. It has:

A vintage camper with AC that will literally chill your soul (10,000 BTU, baby).
A clawfoot soaking tub under the stars.
A private toilet + outdoor shower (don’t worry, no baggies here).
A tiki bar, shaded kitchen, and even a misting fan if you’re feelin’ fancy.
And vibes? Oh, we’ve got vibes. ✨
I made this for people like me—those who don’t need a whole vacation, just a day or night to reset, relax, or sip something strong and remember who they are.

If you’re curious, please check it out:

Your login credentials stop working—without explanation.  
Coworkers give you polite smiles, but when you turn your back, the whispers start.

Management gaslights you. HR says there’s no record of your concerns.

You catch glimpses of documents on your screen that vanish before you can read them.  
Security cameras follow your every move, but when you ask about it, they say **you’re imagining things**.

To be grateful for the paycheck while they decide who climbs, who falls, and who vanishes completely.

They use every tool in their arsenal to crush you—**workplace sabotage, gaslighting, digital manipulation, social isolation**—until you either fall in line or become a ghost in the system.

She starts to pull the threads.  
And that’s when she discovers the **Shadow Mandate**:

It’s connected to **other corporations**, **government agencies**, and **shadow networks** that use surveillance, psychological warfare, and AI manipulation to control lives.  
Her employment wasn’t a coincidence.  
She was **placed** there.

Mais ce qui fonctionne en anglo-américain ne marche pas bien en français. Je dis anglo-américain, non anglais, car le Britannique, qui fredonne avec les Beatles, doit avoir beaucoup de mal à chanter: «*****Self-help! I need nobody…*****»**

>De fait, lorsque quelqu’un s’écrie: «À l’aide!» et même «À moi!», c’est que son moi ne se suffit pas à lui-même. Il en appelle à un autre. Parfois même, en face du train qui lui fonce dessus, dans une spontanéité touchante, cet autre remonte des profondeurs d’une enfance qu’on croyait avoir dépassée, et l’on hurle soudain: «Maman!» Comment m’aider moi-même si je suis à ce point en détresse? N’est-ce pas vouloir me sortir des sables mouvants en me tirant par les cheveux?

>Je dois pourtant reconnaitre que, dans la langue de Molière et de Gaston Miron, nous usons d’un verbe pronominal qui se rapporte au *self-helping*: se servir… «*Help yourself*» se traduit assez précisément par «Servez-vous».

My friend and I are planning a long weekend trip to Taipei this October (9th to 13th) for her birthday, and I was hoping to get some advice and recommendations. We're mostly looking to eat and enjoy wandering around the city, visiting some historical sites, etc. 

I would love to hear anyone's favorite spots for food in general, but in particular if anyone has any for milk tea, oyster omelettes, local-style breakfast, coffee, and Taiwanese desserts, that would be excellent! Also, I'm not sure how prevalent it is in Taiwan, but if anyone has any recommendations for 凉茶 I'd be grateful. 

We'd also like to visit a night market but my friend has social anxiety so I would like to avoid overly crowded areas if possible. Does anyone have any recommendations for less crowded times or night markets that are more low-key?

I'm currently learning Mandarin and looking to pick up some books for learning Taiwanese Mandarin, if anyone has any recommended book shops. 

Finally, if there are any neighborhoods you'd recommend that are nice to wander around in, I'd love to hear them!!

1. wake up
2. reach for phone scroll tiktok/instagram/reddit for 30-60 minutes
3. feel behind and shit before i even got out of bed

so i started making tiny switches. not a 5am cold plunge routine, but just small things that made my brain and body feel alive in the morning.

here’s the full list of things i rotate through (not all every day, but most of these help a lot):

* get sunlight within 10 minutes of waking up (i use an app to block my apps until i take a pic of sun)
* stretch my neck, back, and legs (does wonders for grogginess)
* drink a glass of water with a pinch of salt (electrolytes help more than coffee sometimes)
* write down 1 single priority for the day (not a to-do list, just the one thing)
* take a short walk, even just around the block
* breathwork for 2–3 mins (inhale 4 sec, hold 4, exhale 6–8, calms everything)
* tidy one small thing (bed, sink, desk; gets momentum going)

the biggest lesson: your morning doesn’t need to be productive, but it should feel intentional.

There’s so much going on with staff nowadays in our 1-3 yo class room.
Every week now someone has been on vacation (luckily only 1 at a time) and we’ve been down to 4:18. 

Now bring the constantly “sick” co worker into the mix who has been ghosting us since Monday morning when she was supposed back from leave. This is not the first time or second. Honestly don’t understand how she still has a job her, she calls in like half the time. So sick of it.

We’re down to 3:18. It’s absolute madness because the group is also incredibly difficult (apparently the directors most difficult group, from 18 year experience). They are all over the place and rile each other up, can’t focus for more than 2 seconds and won’t listen.

It’s like a tornado moving inside the classroom when they group up and charge each other’s energies. Every task has to be a pain and absolute chaos. A few children have higher needs that we get no extra support for, triggered into meltdowns from the overstimulating environment. It’s like an out of body experience in the toughest moments. 

Even in such circumstances the room leader unapologetically takes her long ass coffee breaks and daily unnecessarily long “meetings” with office, leaving us 2:18 like this morning

Idk why but the 1:5 ratio has never been respected since I started. I blamed it on understaffing but clearly it’s not just that if you can’t prioritise the class over your gossiping and coffee time.

Had to vent. Been keeping my mouth shut on negative staff behaviour because I feel guilty for not showing them understanding & don’t want to be mean to anyone, but when is enough enough?

Agreed to go to a comedy club and drinks with a guy. Had a lovely evening. At the end of the date I asked him playfully if he’d order me a car home, he said he lived close by and that would mean he’d have to get a black cab. I was like ok I’ll order an Uber myself and he then said no I’ll order you a car, he then asked why I expect that kind of treatment and to me I just like to be looked after and it’s a man being a gentleman. I didn’t like his reaction although he did get me a car home, I’m very used to men ordering me cars there and back on dates and I don’t think it’s a big deal. His point was if he did that for every girl then it would be an issue, and I said well yes if you don’t get along with them which we clearly did.

Is this me or him? It kind of gave me a red flag that he made me feel uncomfortable about it, it’s not like it’s an expensive journey home and it’s not about the money it’s the gesture.

fast forward to march of this year, still self employed but circumstances came up where i could no longer travel for work which was not only a chunk of my income but my regular socialization, so i figured i would supplement my income a bit AND meet some new people by going back to starbucks part time. i got hired and finished my training at the end of march and my first non-training shift gave me immediate whiplash. new hires are stuck on DTO which was draining and i was really not prepared to DTO peaks and was immediately scheduled to be a regular opener. asking most of my shifts for direction or to teach me a task id never been taught was like pulling teeth. when i was finally put on bar regularly, i was still pretty quick and efficient at crafting drinks but the printers NEVER STOP and adding cold foam to everything and writing on cups adds so much unnecessary time while people who just placed their mobiles are sitting in the drive thru with an attitude because their drink with 100 modifications isnt ready in 2 minutes. the bare bones training, the passive aggressive messages about drive times and ""back to starbucks"" garbage made me realize that i am working fast food. i dont want to work fast food and starbucks never felt like fast food when i initially worked for the company. my store just started taking delivery orders and im done. i like the baristas at my store fine and really feel terrible screwing anyone over as the schedules are made for 3 weeks out but i cant do it anymore. its somehow worse than the stress i felt being a shift and i only work part time. i left a notice of resignation in the office today after drowning on solo bar for 3 hours straight. i will never wake up at 4 am for a job again 🥲

My wife was issued a £100 Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN) for “littering” near King’s Cross Station in London. Here’s what happened:

We were traveling from Oxford to Cambridge and had coffee from Paddington Station, which we carried all the way to King’s Cross.

At King’s Cross station exit, we were trying to figure out which train or platform we needed to take for our connection to Cambridge. I had a large luggage bag in one hand and googple maps on my phone in the other, and my wife was holding our 3.5-year-old daughter.

She briefly placed the coffee cups next to the wall near the exit (not on the ground) because she was tired and we were still standing there, trying to sort out where to go.

An enforcement officer approached and started taking my wife’s details without fully explaining why. When I realised what was happening and asked, the officer said it was a £100 fine. I picked up the cups immediately and tried to explain the situation, but they weren’t interested.

Another male officer arrived with an aggressive attitude, demanding my name and postcode without identifying himself or explaining why. He only backed off after the first officer clarified that I had picked up the cups and my wife was the one they were issuing the FPN to.

I understand technically placing items can be considered littering, but we didn’t leave them or walk away – we were just standing there, trying to figure out where to go with no bins in sight. My wife was exhausted and holding a child.

Camden Council’s website says there’s no formal appeal process, but you can “request a review” within 14 days of the FPN. I’m torn:

Should I just pay the £100 fine to avoid escalation?

Or should I write to them, explaining the context and asking them to reconsider?

Has anyone successfully challenged a littering FPN by explaining the circumstances? Do councils actually listen to this kind of thing?


Any advice or shared experiences would be much appreciated!

I (26F, Latina) just got married to my husband Liam (30M), and although our wedding was overall beautiful and magical, a situation involving my sister-in-law-in-law left me feeling conflicted. I’d appreciate your perspective.

So here’s the deal. In my culture, there’s a distinction between a cuñada (sister-in-law, like your husband’s sister or your brother’s wife), and a concuñada, which in English would be something like a sister-in-law-in-law—the wife of your husband’s sibling. Let’s call mine Camille (27F). She’s married to my husband’s older brother, Mark (32M). My actual sister-in-law Sophie (married to my brother) was there too and saw everything unfold. (Side note Sophie wasn’t part of my bridesmaids but she was included in the morning of the wedding for make up and hair cause we are a lot more closer and cause she asked me for a place to get her make up done at least 2 months prior to the wedding, and I have the gf of one of my bridesmaids cancel but her spot was already on the contract, so I told Sophie she could be with us, besides that my brother couldn’t make it to the wedding and I didn’t want for her to feel alone) 

A couple of months before the wedding, I stayed in North Carolina with my father and mother in-law and one of my brothers-in-law Jack (27). I don’t have many friends there and we were living in a retirement community, so I spent a lot of time at home. Camille and Mark also live in NC but farther away, and since I don’t drive and I’m not familiar with the area, I didn’t invite her over. That said, on previous trips to NC, I did try to connect with her and help her with things I know are important to her professionally. We’re not close, but I always try to be cordial and respectful.

The day before the wedding:
We had our rehearsal dinner after walking through the ceremony logistics. Btw the wedding was in my home country. I wasn’t really doing formal introductions—just saying hi to some of my husband’s friends I hadn’t met and introducing him to a couple of my bridesmaids. Camille wasn’t a bridesmaid, but her husband Mark was one of the groomsmen. My sister-in-law Sophie later told me Camille was visibly upset, that no one had introduced her properly, and that she looked uncomfortable all night. She wasn’t alone, though—she was with my in-laws.

Later, Camille and Mark showed up late to the rehearsal dinner. It was raining, so that was understandable. What caught me a little off guard was that Camille arrived in athletic wear and a very bright rain jacket. The event had a formal vibe (even if not fully black tie yet), but I figured maybe her clothes got wet or she was just caught off guard. No big deal.

The glam squad situation:
That night, as we were all saying goodbye, I reminded my bridesmaids about our morning schedule. That’s when Mark asked my husband Liam, if Camille was coming to the hotel to get ready with us. Liam asked me, and I said no. We had a glam team hired with a contract and a specific headcount. And to be honest, Camille and I had never had a conversation about her getting her hair and makeup done with us. It hadn’t even crossed my mind.
I didn’t think she’d want to spend money on separate glam either—mainly because I’ve been told (though I’ve never witnessed it myself) that they sometimes ask my father-in-law to pay for parts of their trips. For example, in this case, I was told Camille went to my father-in-law insisting he book the Airbnb immediately after New Year’s or else she would charge it herself and invoice him later. My father-in-law often gives in because he doesn’t want to cause any problems.

That night, things escalated. Mark and Liam had a heated conversation where Mark said things like “If my wife isn’t welcome, then I’m not welcome either,” and that he, Liam, and Camille needed to talk—just the three of them. Without me. Which I found kind of absurd, because… we’re talking about the morning of my wedding. Why would my husband have a closed-door meeting about it without me?

The morning of the wedding:
My MIL texted me the night before saying she’d be with Camille the next morning. I replied kindly that it wouldn’t be possible. I told her the schedule and the glam team were locked in and that I didn’t want her caught in the middle. I asked her to let Liam talk to his brother directly.

That morning, my FIL, one of the groomsmen and Jack came to our suite to bring pastries and coffee. They mentioned Mark was possibly not going to the hotel because Camille was so upset. Just to be clear—Mark was never not going to the wedding. He was just thinking about skipping the prep at the hotel and going directly to the ceremony.
Our photographer was arriving soon, and I didn’t want this turning into a big thing. I told my wedding planner to let Camille know that if she wanted to come for the photos, she could. Glam wasn’t an option at that point, but I was trying to meet her halfway. My husband also talked to her to say we were waiting. She refused.

She had been crying for hours before the ceremony even began, and even at the place of the ceremony, also mentioned to Jack she was not going to wear make up cause she’ll be crying all day. And when the ceremony started, she was visibly furious. She looks absolutely miserable in every single photo.

The reception:
Our wedding was black tie mandatory, and Camille wore a turquoise North Face rain jacket over her outfit. It clashed with the entire aesthetic and stands out in all the photos.

During the reception, my brother-in-law Jack (our best man) gave a beautiful speech about our relationship and called me his best friend. Camille cried throughout the whole thing—but not in a sentimental way. Then she disappeared.

We had arranged a special dish for her because she has some food restrictions, and I was worried someone else would accidentally be served her plate. I asked my husband where she was and he said, “She went to the bathroom,” but the bathroom was on the opposite end of the venue. Then Mark left to find her. When I asked the wedding planner to check on them, she said they were fighting and Mark told her they’d be back in five minutes. She gently reminded them this wasn’t the time or place. An hour later, they left the wedding without saying goodbye to us—only to my in-laws.

They missed the dinner, the dancing, and everything else.

So… AITA for not including Camille in the bridal prep?",11,1748392026.0,AITAH,11,1.0,False

Hi all! Currently 51 and I have been single since August 2015. I have dated, but no long term partners since I have really learned to love my solitude and my man-free home. I have 2 teens living with me 50/50, with 4 cats, a dog and a ball python so tons of company and never lonely, with friends too in this mix.

I had taken a break from dating for about 2 years since perimenopause has wrecked havoc with my libido, but with HRT I am back to my normal and open to dating. I am on Coffee Meets Bagel app and for some reason I either attract younger men (28-35) or men over 60. 

Curious if any of my co-50's peers have tried dating men 10 years older than them? Interestingly I've only ever once in my life dated an older man (by 3 years), most have been younger (usually by a couple of years, sometimes by 5-10 years).

We talked for about 3 weeks in app, then went out for coffee, then a few weeks later we went to a hockey game, and a few weeks after that we went to a museum and had dinner after. Our texts got more infrequent after the hockey game, but I attributed that to the busyness of her job. Otherwise, I thought we were really hitting it off. We even had another date tentatively planned (a movie). I should mention, these dates were honestly more like outings, I was just trying to get to know her better, wasn't trying to be pushy, but I had hopped in the next few dates or conversations we could start having the conversation of taking things beyond just getting to know each other as friends.

However, after the third ""date"" she never replied back. My first message was just asking her if she got back okay. But she didn't reply and  I took it as her being busy again. Then by the weekend we were going to see the movie, I started to get worried and a bit upset, because we had made plans but I wasn't hearing from her. No texts, no snap-chats, no bumble messages, not picking up for phone calls, did not accept a Facebook friend request.

But unlike first dates I've done which didn't go well, she hasn't blocked me on any platform. I've tried to reach out numerous times, but I've also tried to be sparse sending messages because I don't want to blow up her phone. I know her job is busy, but I feel like she could at least tell me she want's to be done? It's like she died. I sent her one last message today after calling her a second time and she didn't pick up.

Once, in one of my Italian classes, a student raised their hand and asked, ""Why does the *congiuntivo* exist?"" Ah, the infamous *congiuntivo*—the Italian subjunctive mood. It's a grammar beast that even native speakers sometimes wrestle with. If you're learning Italian, you might find yourself in the same boat, scratching your head over this elusive mood.

**Why the subjunctive is a head-scratcher**

Picture this: you're trying to express doubt, hope, or a wish in Italian, and suddenly you're in a linguistic labyrinth. English speakers, in particular, find the subjunctive tricky because it's not used much in English. You might hear it in phrases like ""I suggest that he go,"" but that's about it. In Italian, though, the subjunctive is a whole different ball game.

**Real-life scenarios**

Imagine you're at an Italian café, and you want to say, ""I hope the coffee is good."" In Italian, you'd say, *Spero che il caffè sia buono.* Notice the *sia* instead of *è*? That's the subjunctive at work!

**Tips from a teacher**

Here are a few tips to tame the *congiuntivo*:

- **Practice with common expressions:** Start with phrases like *Spero che tu stia bene* (I hope you are well).

- **Pair verbs with the subjunctive:** Learn verbs that often lead to the subjunctive, like *credere* (to believe) and *sperare* (to hope).

- **Focus on irregular forms:** Some verbs have irregular subjunctive forms. Get familiar with them.

**Your turn!**

Have you ever tangled with the *congiuntivo*? How did it go? Share your stories, and let's navigate this Italian grammar jungle together!

They have two saunas and two cold plunge pools available. ""Ice Sauna"" that has the cold plunge pool inside, and then a bigger sauna, with the cold plunge pool outside. 

Today I saw someone using the cold plunge pool only, but I think they're missing half the experience. If you go, make sure to throw water on the rocks, it's an integral part of the sauna.

So, up until recently I have only been using glass cups for my espresso, both, single and double walled. However, for the past few days I decided to start using a stone/ceramic cup that my wife had gotten for me. For context, I always thought that glass cups are superior in terms of experience because you can see the different color gradients and crema while you're pulling the shot as well as when drinking the coffee, which I find fun. 

  
It's been almost exactly one week since I included the ceramic espresso cup into my rotation, and I can't necesserely explain it but shots taste different in it. The first thing I noticed was that the color of the espresso pops more in the ceramic cup (that's to be expected due to the contrast of the cup walls and liquid). 

Now, my second observation is (maybe) ridiculous, but coffee tastes ""better"" in the ceramic mug. Especially, medium/dark roasts,  the body feels thicker with deeper chocolatey flavors. 

I know I may sound crazy and I am not suggesting that the coffee/liquid is any different in either cup, I know that the difference is mostly sensory, but I can't quite grasp why.

I could be talking about something with work or even with family really vulnerable and I could say my truck. She will stop the conversation to point out I said my truck not the truck. It’s my daily driver I work construction it’s my work truck. It’s my bread and butter and we we’ll fight for hours about it. And I don’t say it maliciously at all.. just simply conversating…opening up.. I’ve told her multiple times how I feel about it I told her I feel like I can’t have ownership over anything … yet I can buy her an iPad and it’s all hers but we picked it out together?… it confuses me to the end of my sanity… I work really hard to provide and show my appreciation for the things she does for me…another example is. In the beginning of the relationship I could be at work going through it bad drive by a coffee place get a coffee and if I didn’t tell her. She watches my location constantly makes mecfeeel like I’m being watched.. I work and go home that’s it..she say oh your not gonna ask me if I want one? Even tho I’m working and can’t exactly just bring her one. She says you can tell me to door dash it. I combat that in any way she would say she’s at home with my daughter least I can do is buy her a coffee if I don’t she doesn’t feel appreciated. So I started every time I got coffee buying her coffee being late going to job sites getting caught on company time getting coffee. Fast forward different job different apartment we live nowhere close to a coffee place. I have to directly tell her every single day. Get you a coffee baby. If I don’t it’s a fight as I’m leaving because I didn’t tell her to get one because she’s gonna watch my location and if I even THINK about getting one without telling her to order one it’s a fight how I don’t appreciate her. Watches my location in an unhealthy manner. I’ve done nothing but be faithful. She will also get upset if I get home and ask my daughter how her day was before I ask her even if I asked her on the phone 20 minutes before… I’m going insane.. things like this have caused me to have angry reactions and blowing up out of anger confusion and frustration just feel like I’m going insane … any advice or help?

1kx2fzr,https://i.redd.it/eoxqug89me3f1.jpeg,How We Lost the Moon (And Why LLMs Might Be Making It Worse),"**TLDR**: The Apollo program's forgotten knowledge is a cautionary tale for how we're learning with LLMs today. Experts have mountains of experience, but newcomers are building knowledge pillars on shifting sand.

  
*This is the first in a series of articles written by Ariel Commodorian, an independent analyst from Argentina. The aim is not to oppose technology, but to help improve it through critical and constructive reflection.*  


# The Casual Take (Grab a Coffee Story)

Did you know that after the US landed on the Moon, we basically forgot how we did it? I'm not kidding – we stopped sending crewed missions, disbanded teams, and lost a ton of the technical know-how. Today, companies like SpaceX have to re-solve problems that were already figured out in the 60s.

Something similar is happening with LLMs. Veterans have years of solid experience in their heads that never gets transferred to any model. Meanwhile, young people learning directly from chatbots risk building shaky ""knowledge pillars"" that fall apart the moment they get a convincing-sounding but wrong answer.

Bottom line: if we don't care about how knowledge gets built and passed down, we'll end up rebuilding rockets we already built... but without the blueprints.

# The Professional Take (Conference Presentation Mode)

The Apollo project wasn't just a space race – it was a collective feat of engineering, documentation, trial and error. However, after its peak in 1969, and especially with falling political and budgetary interest in the 70s, a significant portion of the technical knowledge that made it possible wasn't systematically preserved. Some stayed in blueprints, but much was lost in engineers' heads, in undocumented tacit processes. Decades later, modern programs like SpaceX had to redo solutions that were already discovered, at enormous costs in time and money.

This dynamic reflects a concerning pattern in generative AI. Veteran workers possess solid ""knowledge pillars"" – the result of years of articulated experience, tested against reality and put through trials. However, that knowledge rarely transfers to LLMs: it's neither explicitly trained nor formalized for robust integration.

In contrast, younger generations often begin learning from the LLM interface itself. Without rigorous validation, contrast, and error processes, these users can build defective ""pillars"": superficial knowledge that's plausible but epistemically fragile. Just like with Apollo, the risk is clear: lose expert knowledge without leaving traces, while training new experts on eroding foundations.

# The Technical Deep Dive (Academic Paper Mode)

The analogy between post-Apollo ""technical amnesia"" and LLM-induced epistemological erosion holds across three axes: (1) loss of non-formalized tacit knowledge, (2) dependence on opaque high-complexity systems, and (3) generational training on unverified bases.

During Apollo, systems engineering and subsystem integration (propulsion, inertial navigation, thermal control, analog redundancies) required more than blueprints — it relied on distributed tacit expertise.. Team dissolution, technological obsolescence, and lack of functional semantic archiving meant operational knowledge wasn't preserved as transferable stack.

Today, with LLMs as primary epistemic interface for digital natives, a homologous risk emerges. Models operate as generative response systems with high plausibility but low epistemological traceability by design (Stochastic Parrots, Bender et al., 2021). Content generation without rigorous validation fosters what we might call ""epistemic degradation by interface"": users substituting construction processes with queries, inhibiting consolidation of structured knowledge schemas (System 2, Kahneman 2011; Deep Knowledge Structures, Sweller 2006).

Simultaneously, the lack of expert knowledge integration in training datasets – due to absence of verified corpora or structural formalization of tacit knowledge – limits LLMs' potential to even partially replace that layer. This underscores the urgency for ""epistemic preservation protocols"": hybrid interfaces or expert-curated buffers that retain tacit knowledge and prevent its dissolution in stochastic abstraction.

The world of food saw a flurry of activity on May 27, 2025, ranging from consumer health advice and celebrity encounters to the latest fluctuations in the food processing and beverage industry stocks. Here’s a comprehensive overview of the key developments:

**Decoding Food Labels and Navigating Dietary Choices**

A crucial piece of consumer information highlighted the often-misunderstood language used on food packaging. As reported by indianexpress.com, the distinction between ""sugar-free"" and ""no added sugar"" labels is critical for making informed dietary choices. The report underscored that while both terms suggest lower sugar content, they aren't interchangeable. Kanikka Malhotra, a consultant dietician and certified diabetes educator, clarified that “The terms ‘sugar-free’ and ‘no added sugar’ are regulated differently across the globe.” This nuance is particularly important for individuals managing diabetes or closely monitoring their sugar intake, as misunderstanding these labels can lead to unintended sugar consumption. This emphasis on clarity aims to help consumers make informed choices when navigating the complex world of food labels.

**Celebrity Food Preferences and the Allure of a Classic Dish**

Celebrity food preferences also made headlines, with a glimpse into the interactions between renowned choreographer Farah Khan and actress Alaya F. Khan, known for her culinary skills, visited Alaya F's Mumbai home, bringing along her special roast chicken, cooked by her cook Dilip. The twist? Alaya F, who is currently on a month-long vegetarian journey, had to decline the offering. She explained, ""I am a vegetarian for this month. Yes, I can have roast chicken next month."" Her mother, Pooja Bedi, however, seemed more than happy to enjoy the dish. This anecdote offers a lighthearted look into the evolving food choices of celebrities and underscores the enduring appeal of classic comfort food, even for those taking a temporary hiatus from meat. Khan’s roast chicken recipe, which she shared previously, further highlights the interest in home-cooked meals.

**Market Trends and Stock Performance in the Food Industry**

The financial sector saw noteworthy activity within the food and beverage industry, with significant updates on the performance of key stocks. Three major players in the Indian food market – Nestle India, Britannia Industries, and Tata Consumer Products – saw their share prices fluctuate during the day.

*   **Nestle India:** Operating in the Food Processing & Packaging sector, Nestle India's share price was at ₹2466.15. The stock experienced fluctuations, with a low of ₹2431.65 and a high of ₹2481.6. Over the past 52 weeks, shares saw a low of ₹2115 and a high of ₹2777. Performance metrics indicated a 0.39% return in one day, 2.45% over the past month, and 8.1% in the last three months. The daily pivot level was set at 2443.68.
*   **Britannia Industries:** Also in the Food Processing & Packaging sector, Britannia Industries had a share price of ₹5497.75. The stock fluctuated with a low of ₹5477.2 and a high of ₹5537. Over the past 52 weeks, shares saw a low of ₹4506.5 and a high of ₹6473.1. The stock showed a -0.44% return in one day, 1.25% over the past month, and 14.88% in the last three months. The daily pivot level for the stock was set at 5508.17.
*   **Tata Consumer Products:** Operating in the Tea & Coffee sector, Tata Consumer Products' share price was at ₹1136.7. The stock fluctuated between a low of ₹1127.4 and a high of ₹1149.4. Over the past 52 weeks, shares saw a low of ₹884 and a high of ₹1246.42. The performance metrics showed a -0.75% return in one day, -1.67% over the past month, and 12.82% in the last three months.

1kx2fdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kx2fdi/help_me_tweak_my_gemilai_3149/,Help me tweak my Gemilai 3149,"Hey there! As I mentioned in the title, I need some tweaks to our Gemilai 3149 espresso machine. We're a small delivery-only coffee venture in the Philippines operated by a husband-and-wife duo. We picked the Gemilai 3149 because it's the most affordable one that meets our need for a machine: dual boiler, PID system, direct water line (assisted by an electric pump, of course), preinfusion function, the works. It's not the best machine I've used but because I can tweak a number of settings, I can pull a respectable shot.

While we have made a number of upgrades to our workflow such as a calibrated tamper and WDT tool, I was actually thinking of doing some tweaks to the machine side of things, specifically the portafilter (and basket) and the group shower screen. That said, other tweaks are welcome as long as we don't have to fiddle with the guts (I'm not comfortable with my tinkering skills).

So anyway, here's what I have so far, which confuses the bejeesus out of me:

* I messaged Pesado about compatibility of their [high-diffusion shower screens](https://pesado585.com/products/pesado-hd-high-diffusion-shower-screen) with Gemilai E61 group, but here's what they said (sucks but it is what it is):

>unfortunately the Gemilai uses a different type of threaded diffusion screw on the E61 group head, one that is not compatible with the one we made

* I messaged a local supplier of coffee tools that sells IMS shower screens and recommended [this](https://www.pukawcoffeetools.com/collections/precision-shower-screens/products/ims-precision-shower-screen-e61200im) and [this](https://www.pukawcoffeetools.com/collections/precision-shower-screens/products/e61-matrix%C2%AE-shower-screen) for my machine, but doesn't guarantee compatibility.
* However, I also saw [this video](https://youtu.be/T2GqNAt4tTE) where they change the shower screen of a Gemilai 3605 with an IMS one specifically designed for La Cimbali (the video says it's [CI200NT](https://imsfiltri.com/prodotto/ci200nt/) so it's definitely for La Cimbali).

Anyway, if you have worked on this machine before and have suggestions, I'm open to suggestions. So far, what I'm thinking of getting are the following:

* Shower screen replacement (IMS CI200NT is my top contender so far if the YouTube video above is to be believed)
* Straight-walled portafilter basked (looking at IMS Big Bang)
* Bottomless portafilter (some generic 58mm one will do)

That said, take note that we're locked in with this machine for a while, which means that's the answer to your ""why not get XYZ machine instead?"" reply. I'm happy with this machine so far, and I want to overcome its limitations by working with it, not simply making it go away.

Looking forward to hearing from y'all. Thanks!

I’ll be super upfront with you to save you some time in case you actually clicked into this post. 

I’m only interested in men in North America, PST, MST,or central would be ideal. Only looking for around mid thirties to forties. I’m agnostic and liberal.

Since you are on this specific sub i can imagine finding someone has been a challenge. We both know this isn’t easy, we don’t do things with rose-colored glasses at our age. It’s lonely out here and I’m just trying to find someone that i can connect with. It doesn’t have to be perfect, and let’s be real, it won’t be. But that doesn’t mean it can’t be real. 

Ok now to the rest.

I see men post and talk all the time about fun and passion and adventure…and I’m none of that. I live a very simple, routine-based, uncomplicated life. Am i happy? No, not really. Am i unhappy? No, not really either. I kinda just am. 

I don’t have niche interests, I’m not gonna be player two in whatever games you like to play. I don’t really care about your unique tastes in obscure music. I don’t follow any sports. 

I’m very much a basic B. I like ice coffee, i read, i have cats, i sing-along (very poorly) to Taylor swift and Disney music. I like shopping, i like hiking, i like coloring and artsy stuff. 

I don’t think our interests need to align, you can have your thing and i can have my thing. I want something more than just friends, i want a connection that transcends our hobbies and the crap that people thinks defines us. 

And cuz the physical does actually matter, here’s me:

1kx25yj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kx25yj,My own HwaBoon…and a tutorial!!,"I finally made a full-sized HwaBoon!!! I'm so excited and I love it so much. I thought I'd share my process in case anyone was wondering, but let me preface this by saying I am NOT an expert and I was totally making this up as I went along. 

I only made one HwaBoon, but made two different pot styles because I couldn't decide which style I wanted to use (the original style from when the show opened or the newer style they started using a couple months ago - pics 1 and 2, respectively). 

I included one of my Mini HwaBoons in the photo for color reference. As you can see, the paint I used is slightly less green, but I wanted a spray paint so my choices were more limited than with other types of paint. From studying one zillion pictures of HwaBoon, it seems the OG pot was slightly more green and shorter and the newer pot is slightly more blue and taller, but since we'll never see the two together so I'm just using my best guess on colors and dimensions.

So...here are the details for those who are wondering!

Succulents - I scoured the internet and thought these were the closest match to the OG HwaBoon: CM4128-CV (15464) - Echeveria Pick X3 13"" Coffee — Designer Flower Center LLC (https://designerflowercenter.net/products/echeveria-pick-x3-13-coffee-ea-12)

I ordered two. The newer HwaBoon has slightly different shapes/colors so if you're wanting to model off of that version you might want to shop around more. I think people have also used these more affordable ones from Michael's: Ashland® Succulent Pick | Michaels (https://www.michaels.com/product/ashland-succulent-pick-10128870)

Daisy - I never did find a daisy that was JUST like the one in the show. I went with this one from Etsy, but any pink Gerbera daisy is probably going to have the same effect. 25.6"" Real Touch Gerbera Daisy ，artificial Faux Flower in 7 Colors for Bouquet，wedding，party - Etsy (https://www.etsy.com/listing/1676636258/256-real-touch-gerbera-daisy-artificial)

Pot - I modeled them myself and printed them in white (available here: Pot for DIY Hwaboon From Maybe Happy Ending Hwaboon Broadway Musical - POT ONLY - Etsy; https://www.etsy.com/listing/4311561226/?ref=share_ios_native_control) The OG pot is 5.7 inches tall and the newer style is 6 inches tall. 

I started by spray-painting the white pot (pic 3) with Rustoleum Ocean Mist gloss paint. Spray paint upside down to keep the interior white (pic 4). (I was going to use a filler primer first to smooth out layer lines and get all fancy with sanding, but I ended up skipping this step and jumping straight to the Ocean Mist paint.) 

Once dry, I hand-painted painted black on the lip of the pot with just plain acrylic paint. The black rim on real HwaBoon is roughly painted, but I don't do ""random"" very well, so ended up just painting it solidly black. Then I sealed it with Rustoleum Triple Thick Glaze (pic 5).

Next I prepped the succulents (pic 6) by just pulling the heads off - they pop right off. I attached each one to 18"" stem wire (pic 7). Paper Wrapped Stem Wire by Ashland® | Michaels (https://www.michaels.com/product/paper-wrapped-stem-wire-by-ashland-10174354?michaelsStore=2028&inv=4) I just used super strong tape, but you could also use wire or hot glue (pic 8/9).

Next I figured out how I wanted the succulents to be arranged (pic 10). 

The next step was figuring out how to make the stems thicker and give it that twisted look that real HwaBoon has (pic 11). 

To make the stems thicker, I tried a few things, but ultimately ended up just wrapping them in a layer of the same tape that I already had. https://a.co/d/6bJQggo  Painter's tape, masking tape, or something else would also work - it's just what I had. (pic 12)  
 
Then I used this Wired Hemp by Ashland® | Michaels (https://www.michaels.com/product/wired-hemp-by-ashland-10336518?michaelsStore=2028&inv=7) to wrap each stem (pic 13). You're also going to cover the whole thing with this floral tape (pic 14) Brown Floral Tape by Ashland™ | Michaels (https://www.michaels.com/product/brown-floral-tape-by-ashland-10250036?michaelsStore=2028&inv=2). Starting at the top of each stem, I'd wrap it down to where the stem joins another stem in my layout and then add in the next stem and keep wrapping. It took some trial and error to figure out the best order, so my advice here is to leave your wire long when you cut it so you can go back and re-wrap a section if needed. Once you've gotten it how you want it, trim the ends of the long stem wires to the same length (pic 16).

On top of the wire layer, you're going to wrap the whole thing in the floral tape (which you can see that I've started in pics 15/16 - the tops of the stems are easier to do before you start attaching them to other stems). If you've never worked with it before, it sticks to itself so you don't need any other tape/glue to use it. You just have to give each section a light stretch (important!!) to activate the stickiness and then wrap it tightly around the stems overlapping as you go. Make sure to fully cover the tape/wire underneath (pic 17 shows it all wrapped). 

Then I needed to paint the stem. I ended up using two acrylic paints I had around the house (pic 18) and a kitchen sponge so it wasn't too uniform like it would be with a brush. I used a tan and a green and just sponged them on randomly. It's not perfect up close, but good enough - I was about to chuck the whole thing out of the window after fiddling with the wire and floral tape. Lol.

Then I shaved down some dry floral foam to fit in the pot (pic 19). It cuts easily with an box cutter or kitchen knife. You only need one block from a pack like this: FloraCraft® DryFōM Brick Green | Michaels. (https://www.michaels.com/product/floracraft-dryfm-brick-green-10302810?michaelsStore=2028&inv=16)

I twisted the knife into the foam to make a hole for the HwaBoon branch and used a straw to poke a hole for the daisy (which I trimmed to the right height). (Pic 19).

Then I put the whole thing in the pot and poured some marbles around it to help stabilize the foam (since I didn't want to glue it in so I could switch pots) and give HwaBoon some heft so he isn't top-heavy. Then I put some Spanish moss on top. Spanish Moss by Ashland® | Michaels (https://www.michaels.com/product/spanish-moss-by-ashland-10349407?michaelsStore=6001&inv=5)

He did regular hangouts where he’d reach out to everyone too so it could be written off.


 But whenever he found out that anything was going on without him he would get super passive aggressive and start blowing up peoples phones or acting weird. Ex; doesnt rock climb but insisted on forcing his way in to a meetup and chilled at the bottom then immediately proposed sitting at a coffee shop after everyone was down 😂 .


For his case I’m assuming it was a fear of being left out or alone which stemmed this behavior and his special hangouts were an attempt to build up rapport with certain individuals to make sure he was safe.

Let me tell you: waking up in the middle of a ""heavy-duty"" cycle in an industrial-sized washing machine is a surefire way to lose one's cool. Only upside? They come out smelling like Tide. 

>No one is really sure where they came from. One day, the Uber Eats guy was delivering some chow, and they just came in walking right behind. Did they walk all the way from Fresno? Should we expect the little one to show up anytime soon? Are they just a balloon and some pajama pants? We don't know, and they won't tell. Come to think of it, they don't say a whole lot. But hey, they smell like Tide...

**Jackalope:**

>Before we met Ralph, we all thought Jackalopes were cuddly, fluffy critters, happily bouncing through the trees. That was our first mistake. Had we read the available literature a little more carefully, we'd have realized these freaks are vicious and unhinged! They even recommended covering your legs with stove pipes to avoid being maimed by their antlers.

>Only thing that keeps them happy and chill? Whiskey (I mean, I'm with them there.) Good thing some of the Unexplainables are borderline alcohol... Sorry, our PR department just gently made me realize I'm misrepresenting the fact that we at Unexplainables HQ have a decent bar for after-hours activities. Nothing more. Thanks, Melinda. You can put away the taser, now...

>Aaaanyway. For whatever reason, we had a good reserve of whiskey on hand, which made Ralph's socialization way, way easier. Too bad we forgot to check periodically and ran out pretty soon after. That was our second mistake, and it ended up causing the Limping Capybara incident of '67. But that's a story for another time.

**Bob the Zombie:**

>Bob the Zombie. It has a nice ring to it, right? We're still not sure where he came from, to be honest. One day, he just started bringing people coffee during meetings. 

>I guess we all assumed he'd been recruited from one of the realities where zombies are common, like Virus-Earth (Earth-37), or Earth-158, where AI and TikTok control the global government. Thing is, there are no reports of him ever being processed through Intake, and the only clue we have is a driver's license for a ""Robert Legendre"" that fell out of his pocket once.

The woman is a reporter or maybe even police and the team of journalists just successfully got footage of super powered people. Once the footage uploads the woman is the first one to see it in which she realizes the people in the video is actually her family and releasing this video would expose them as super-powered people. 

The woman ends up either deleting the footage or I think it was a big dramatic thing and she spilled coffee or water on all of the equipment and destroyed the footage evidence. This caused all the other staff and coworkers to become angry and upset that they lost their big moment from the footage and the woman’s boss ended up firing her on the spot because of it. The woman left with a serious facial expression almost not feeling guilty for protecting her family even if it meant losing her job.

We went on a date, hit it off right away, and even kissed during the date before I walked her home. After that, I left the city for a week, but we kept in touch by messaging and calling. Since then, we had a quick coffee date and she came over for dinner last week. We’ve had a lot of fun together, and I really feel a strong connection.

Same story as most of you. I'm a 48 year old HLM. My wife is a 47 LLF. The bedroom has been an issue from the beginning. At the start, it was mostly my fault. I brought a ton of religious baggage into the marriage (she didn't have any). I was learning how to be vulnerable, open with desire, know myself, etc. That was 20 years ago and for the last 15 or so, I've really been working on it. I'm in individual therapy and it's going well, but it's not 100% me. It's her too. We've had the ""talk"" more times than we should have. It just goes in circles. She's not very open to therapy. She'll say she is in theory, but only for a session or two otherwise she feels it's just silly. I don't agree, but it's not her thing. 

When I initiate, it usually doesn't go well. Admittedly, I don't think I'm very good at it, but I try. Maybe a massage, light flirting, a suggestive text, etc. It ends with same mostly with a gentle no thanks. I can tell she wants to want it, but would be happier if sex wasn't a thing she had to worry about. The other day she said, ""I owe you sex soon"" and then yesterday when I leaned in for a kiss, she pushed away and then said ""I know you were trying"". Kind of a gut punch. The night before, she'd suggested that I bring her coffee around 9:45am and we could have sex. I felt a little silly like a dog being rewarded for sitting, but played along. I made her coffee and put it on a nice tray with a flower, strawberries, some bacon, etc. When I walked in, she was still asleep after setting her alarm. I just left the breakfast up there. Around 11am, she came down and said thanks. Nothing ended up happening obviously. 

Tonight, she might initiate since she gets suggestive after a bunch of rejections. I just don't want to say yes to that. It feels one-sided and coerced. I'm sure I can do more. Be more aggressive, be more confident, etc. But eventually, it just stops being fun. Yes, I've read No More Mr. Nice Guy and I've done a lot of work on covert contracts and self-respect. I'm fine with a no and don't sulk about it. I just move on with my day and try again another time if I want to. It's just not part of our dynamic anymore and couples therapy feels out of reach for us. Our kids will be out of the house in 5 years and I'm kind of sad because then all the excuses will be gone. It'll just be us and I'm scared that I'm building up resentment that can't be undone. ",2,1748388036.0,sexlessmarriage,2,1.0,False

Hello 👋 so let’s talk about something people have VERY mixed feelings about... psychic readings 😅💫 Some folks totally swear by them like it’s their daily coffee ☕✨ while others are like “nah, that’s just entertainment” 🎭👀. So... which one is it? Are psychic readings just fun stuff you do for a laugh, or can they actually *guide you* in life? Let’s dive in 🧠🔍

**✨ Get Your Psychic Reading NOW, Available 24/7! 🔮 Ready for answers? Don’t wait – check out the top post in this subreddit for instant insights and guidance. Your future is waiting! 🌟**

Okay now back to it 😄 So here’s the truth: psychic readings can be BOTH. Yup. Depends on how you use them and what kind of mindset you bring to the table. If you’re just curious and looking to kill time, getting your cards read can be fun and spooky like watching a horror movie on a rainy night 🎬🌧️ But for some people, especially when they’re feeling stuck or confused, a reading can feel like a cosmic wake-up call 💥💌

Think about it. When life throws you those “what now??” moments — like relationship drama 💔, career indecision 💼😩, or just straight-up existential “what’s my purpose” spirals — you want *something* to hold onto, right? That’s where tarot or psychic insight can offer a new perspective. Even if it’s not telling your future *exactly*, it helps you think about your situation in a way you might’ve missed before 🧩👁️

Now yes... not all readings are deep and powerful. Sometimes they’re a total miss or feel generic af 😬. And yeah, there are definitely scammy people out there pretending they’ve got “the gift” but are really just trying to make a quick buck 💸🙄. So you’ve gotta use your common sense too. Trust your gut and don’t fall for anyone trying to scare you or sell you a curse removal 💀🚫

But if you find someone who feels *real* — someone who picks up on things they couldn’t possibly guess — it can be kinda mind-blowing 🧠💣. Like, how did they know that? Or how did that one card describe my whole situation?! 😲🎴 Those are the moments that make you wonder if something bigger *is* at play in the universe 🌌🌀

A lot of people who turn to psychic guidance aren’t doing it for flashy predictions either. They want comfort, clarity, or even just someone to listen while they sort out their emotions 🧘‍♀️❤️ Sometimes it’s easier to hear advice when it’s wrapped in a mystical vibe. Kinda like therapy but with sparkles ✨🪬

And real talk: it doesn’t *have* to be 100% accurate to be valuable. Sometimes just the reflection and questions during a reading are what help you make a choice. Like when a card says “let go” and you’re like “ugh fine, I *know* I need to but I didn’t want to admit it” 😅💔 It pushes you to be honest with yourself. And that’s pretty powerful.

So is it guidance? Yep. Is it entertainment? Also yep. Depends on the vibe. Some people use astrology and tarot like spiritual tools 🔧🌟 and others are like “yo let’s see if I’m gonna find love this weekend” 😆💋 Both are valid!

What matters most is: are you getting something out of it that feels helpful, healing, or hopeful? 🌈🧿 If the answer’s yes, then hey — let the skeptics roll their eyes 👁️ whatever. Not everything magical has to make sense to everyone ✌️😌

Bottom line: psychic readings are what *you* make of them. You can take it lightly or take it seriously. But either way, they’ve helped a lot of people feel less lost and more in control 💪🌌

So yeah, don’t knock it till you try it 😉🔮 Whether you’re in it for laughs or for life clarity... it might just surprise you. 💭💜

Got a question on your mind? Something bugging your heart? Go get a reading 🃏✨ sometimes the universe whispers through a card, a dream, or a stranger. You never know where that little nudge might lead... 👣🌙

Picture a sleepy, suburban street where the most exciting thing that ever happens is someone’s Amazon package gets delivered a day late. I moved here three years ago, always minding my own business—and my parking space. That space, right in front of my townhouse, is a sacred strip of asphalt that I have protected more fiercely than any driveway in America.

Enter my neighbor, “Dave.” Dave with the always-too-loud truck and the TikTok-famous dog (no, really, the dog has more followers than I do). For some reason, Dave’s two-car driveway isn’t enough for his collection of beaters and “project vehicles.” One morning I come out and my spot is taken. By Dave’s “new” (read: ancient and leaky) pickup. I knock, politely ask him not to do it again. He shrugs, says “it’s just a spot.” For weeks, Dave rotates his cars through my space like he’s running a valet service out of my life.

So, I take the high road. I leave friendly notes. I bake cookies and attach them to the notes (gluten free, just in case). I even hand-write a letter, outlining parking etiquette with an included diagram. Each time, my spot is still taken. I call the city and learn there’s nothing they can do because it’s technically not “assigned.” But this is war, and I am a soldier armed with caramel blondies and passive-aggressive Post-Its.

That’s when inspiration strikes. I get up at dawn, parade my recycling bins from the garage to the curb, lined perfectly along the space. I spend every morning in a camping chair right on the edge of my spot, sipping coffee and reading the local paper, ignoring Dave’s confused stares. Eventually, he stops. Our street returns to peace, my parking spot sacred once more. And just as I lean back, triumphant, my chair and I are abducted by a group of hyper-intelligent flamingos from Neptune, who needed a new expert on parallel parking for their intergalactic HOA tribunal.",1,1748387737.0,u_KarenAteMyDad,0,1.0,False

Aside from that I have felt a bit of other symptoms that I had been warned about such as some nausea, some jaw clenching and sooo much yawning, but after reading some posts here I’m hopeful that these side effects will subside after a while. I love coffee but the decreased anxiety and racing thoughts would be worth going cold turkey if it makes me feel so strange, but I think the meds are also making me feel strange lol

Hi Reddit,
English isn’t my first language, so please excuse any mistakes.

I’m a 22-year-old woman. I was raised by my grandparents (grandma 83, grandpa 94) until I was 9. Then my mom took me and my younger sister back to live with her. Life with my mom was a nightmare. She was extremely abusive—physically and emotionally. She yelled constantly, never let us speak our minds, and beat me often. She always favored my sister and literally called me the devil and my sister the angel in front of other people, like it was a joke.

That’s not even the story I want to share, but some background is necessary.

Even after moving in with my mom, I stayed very close to my grandparents. I’d spend weekends and holidays with them, and I always helped around the house. Honestly, I did most of the chores on my own. My grandfather is quite controlling, so whenever my mom or uncles felt overwhelmed, they’d just send me over to ""distract"" him. None of them would help my grandma with anything—doctor’s appointments, cleaning, etc.—but I always showed up. No one forced me. I just loved them and felt responsible.

I’ve never claimed to be a perfect child. I’ve struggled a lot mentally over the years, but I’ve worked hard to get better. I used to have a stealing habit as a child (especially food), which I developed partly because I was constantly falsely accused of stealing money growing up. My mom would beat me until I “confessed” even when I was innocent, only to find the money later and never apologize. It happened so many times, and over time, I did end up stealing during middle school—but I stopped when I was around 14 and have never done it since.

I now have a job, go to school, and pay for my own needs. But even now, occasionally, someone in my family will still randomly accuse me of stealing.

Today something happened that absolutely broke me.

I stopped by my grandparents’ place (as usual, in a rush between classes and work) to help out. Out of nowhere, my grandmother accused me of stealing money. She grabbed my bag and emptied it, yelling at me to return the money so she wouldn't tell anyone . She’s never done this before. She’s always been my safe space. I was so shocked I cried, swearing I didn’t take anything. I even told her to go ahead and tell my mom, knowing how badly that could end for me—but I also knew they wouldn’t find anything because I didn’t do it.
Oh
She just kept yelling, insisting I give it back. Then suddenly… silence. A bit later, she told me to “gather my things.” Then she just sat with me in the kitchen like nothing had happened, offering me coffee. Oh and the weirdest part ?? When I asked her to tell my mom she threatened that she'd never talk to me or forgive me if i tell her ( it was my only way to prove my innocence )

I’ve been awake for 7 hours now, unable to sleep or cry. I feel numb. It shattered my heart. I always thought of them as the only people I could truly count on. I showed up for them constantly—even when no one else did—and they accused me like I was some thief who dropped by to steal their money.

Now I’m seriously thinking about going no contact. But I also feel incredibly guilty—they’re so old. What if they die and I wasn’t there? I don’t know how to deal with this. I can’t keep putting myself in situations where I’m treated like this, even by people I love.

If anyone has been through something similar, please share your experience. I just feel really alone in this.

I’m into anime, gaming, and tech. Right now I’m building a media server and kicking off a small game dev business. Weekday afternoons I moonlight as a real-world NPC whose job is making sure nothing exciting happens—but weekends are wide open for chill hangs or regular meetups.

I’ve tried Meetup, Eventbrite, Facebook Groups, Craigslist, etc.—but nothing’s quite clicked. Someone told me I “work too much,” and yeah… maybe they’re right. I haven’t had a regular friend group in a while, and I’d like to change that.

Not into hiking or gyms (I built one in my room), but I do get out for airsoft now and then. Mostly, I’m just looking for fun, low-pressure hobbies with good conversation—like:

* D&D or other tabletop RPGs (newb)
* TCGs
* Warhammer 40k(newb, only painted up some Deathwatch old Astarte)
* Anime discussion nights
* Board games or nerdy hangouts

If you’re already in a group around Auburn, Rocklin, Roseville, etc., or down to start one, hit me up. I’d be happy to meet over coffee or a game table.

Many politicians vanished from the public eye after the first burnings.

Intelligence agencies had already delivered the truth:

This was no hoax — it was law.

A law that no title, no faith, no rank could defy.



But there was one institution where fear arrived more slowly.

One that had hidden for centuries behind the veil of piety.

One that had mastered the art of lying better than anyone.



Religion.



And today...

The Vatican.



The day began like any other.

Robed clerics shuffled through the halls.

Candles were lit, floors swept, whispers of prayers dissolved into the cold stone.

Nuns bent in morning service beneath the shadows of marble columns.

Cardinals exchanged gossip, whispered intrigues — who to pressure, which bishop to replace, where to “expand true faith.”



— We’ve nearly secured the council in Quito, — said one.

— Just need to approve the new coordinator, — replied another.

— The main thing is to keep those bastards from the East out...



Their conversation was cut short when a man burst into the hall — from the Segreteria di Stato, the Secretariat of State.

But he wasn’t just a messenger.

He was a harbinger of alarm — the kind who only appears when something colossal is about to collapse.



He ran.

And on his face — terror. Pure. Seared in. Unmistakable.



— Eminenze... — he gasped. — You… you need to see this. Immediately.



The cardinals exchanged glances — slowly, reluctantly.

But when he repeated:



— It’s above us.

— Over St. Peter’s Square…

— A being. It’s hanging in the sky.

— And it’s happening all over the world.



They rushed to the windows.

Then — to the balconies.



And they saw it.



Above the grand plaza — the place where pilgrims gathered, where the Pope spoke, where armies were blessed and children baptized —

hung a figure.



A black suit.

No visible face.

The air around it was frozen.

Physics no longer applied.

Reality bent to him.



— What kind of devil’s trick is this? — whispered one cardinal.

— Illusion? A hologram...?

— Heresy. A demon. Satan. Herod...



But none of them spoke further.

Because down below stood thousands of people.

All staring upward.



And then…

a voice.



Not from loudspeakers.

From within.



It spoke in every language.

The same sentence.

Cold. Calm. Without tone or emotion.

But to each listener — it sounded familiar.



— First rule.

— Lies no longer exist.



A moment of silence.

And then… panic.



One person — burst into blue flames.

A scream.

A shriek.

Above them, words appeared in the air:



""Said he didn’t steal church donations. Lied.""



Another — a few steps away.

Also ignited.

Floating above:



""Seduced a novice. Denied it.""



Cries.

The crowd tried to flee, but the flames didn’t spread like a plague.

They spread like questions.

One by one.

Slowly. Relentlessly.



The security aide, the one who had brought the cardinals, stood frozen.

Snapping out of his daze, he reached for his radio.



— We need to get them out! Now!



They fled deeper into the basilica.

Down corridors, through chambers, behind marble doors.

But — fire on the right.

Fire on the left.



Blue tongues of flame.

Familiar faces.

The archivist. The abbot. The old bishop.



And above each — a sentence.



""Lied about a prophecy. Served fear, not faith.""



Outside, the square had become a purgatory.

Those who lied — burned.

Those who were silent — wept.

Some fell to their knees, praying.

Others whispered in disbelief:



""This can’t be happening.""

""That’s… not God.""



But above them all —

He hovered.

Silent.

Watching.



Chapter 9: Holy Hell (continued)

Scene I — Rome



Rome.

Clear skies.

Above the basilica’s dome — white clouds, like brushstrokes on a saint's icon.

Untouched by shadow.



But in St. Peter’s Square, it was already different.

Where usually whispers of prayer rose with the bells,

there were now screams.

Different ones.

Sharp. Hoarse. Silent.



The crowd broke apart.



Some ran in terror, stumbling, losing shoes, children, sanity.

Others dashed between souvenir stalls, looking for shelter beneath flimsy tents.

Some pressed against storefronts, as if glass could protect from the absolute.



But not everyone ran.



Some — walked.

Slowly.

With wide pupils and lowered arms, muttering prayers.



They weren’t fleeing fear.

They were walking — toward faith.



They dropped to their knees right there on the sunbaked stone.

Some in designer suits, clutching cameras.

Others barefoot, with dirty hands and tear-swollen eyes.



They looked upward.



To where It hovered.



They crossed themselves — with desperation.

As if a gesture could rewrite the past.

They struck their chests.

They whispered:



""Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me...""



They prayed.

Hands folded, elbows on the ground, faces buried in stone.



But sadly…

This was not God.



This was something else.

Something that had rewritten reality.

It had not come to save.

It had come to expose.



It did not offer a choice.

It named the price — for every lie, every “I’m fine,” every “I love you,” every “we never lie.”



It broke no laws.

It created new ones.



And with every moment, it became clearer:

To pray to it…

was to beg the executioner to bless the axe.



And still, they prayed.



Because it was easier.

Because no one knew what else to do.



Scene II — Behind Closed Doors



Outside — the crowd shattered.

Inside — a heavy silence.



Deep within the Vatican, beneath carved arches and frescoed ceilings,

in an old crisis chamber known as Aula Silencio,

three men sat.



Three cardinals.

Three pillars.

The ones who always knew what to say.

But not today.



The door was locked behind them.

Swiss Guards stood outside.

Phones — disconnected.

Screens — glowing with live feeds from around the world.



“Above every capital,” whispered Archbishop Orlando Sepriani.

“The same figure.”

“The same phrase.”

“The same result.”



He was the oldest.

His hands didn’t tremble from age — but from the unknown.

He had buried popes. Presided over conclaves.

He had passed judgments.

But now he sat like a student before an exam that could not be studied for.



“This... is impossible,” said Cardinal Luis Portelli,

a heavy man with a face carved from basalt.



He clutched his rosary, but no prayers would form.

The beads slipped through his fingers like sand.



“Everything is possible,” said the third.

Raphael Marcelli — young, charismatic, a man of cameras.

He wasn’t praying.

He was watching.



“Anything is possible… when fear is involved,” he said.

“And fear...”

He paused.

“Fear makes us vulnerable.”

“And it makes them — controllable.”



He pointed at the screen.



There was the square.

People praying.

People burning.



Among them — some still standing.

Staring.

Doing nothing.



“That is not God,” Portelli muttered.

“That’s a demon. A provocation. The antichrist.”



“Who decides what God is?” Marcelli asked quietly, not turning his head.

“You? Or the one whose words become reality?”



Sepriani raised a hand — cutting the tension.



“Quiet.”



He gestured at a new broadcast.

Tokyo.



Live footage: rockets rising.

One. Then two. Then six.



Silence.



They watched.

Darkness turned into fire.



Flash.

Explosion.

The sky shook.



The cardinals froze.



“Is he… destroyed?” whispered Portelli.



No one answered.



The feed trembled.

Ash.

Flame.

No figure.



“What now…?” murmured Marcelli.

“Maybe…”



And then — in the corner of the room

a fire ignited.



Blue.

No smoke.

No heat.

Silent.



A man caught fire.



It was a young assistant from the archives, who had stood quietly in the back.

He made coffee. Sorted schedules. Ran errands.



Now he stood — ablaze.

Still.

Not screaming.



Above his head — glowing words:



“Said he was in the archives.

In truth — was hiding.”



The cardinals recoiled.



“Who asked the question?” croaked Sepriani.



“I… I did,” whispered Marcelli.

“I just asked where he was while we were waiting.”



Silence.



And only the fire remained.





Chapter 10: The Walls Tremble





Scene I — Japanese Parliament, Tokyo



Tokyo.

Parliament building.

A hall with a massive oval table, walls of dark wood, large screens broadcasting live footage: fiery skies over the city, explosions, journalists' screams.



In the hall — about 12 people.

Ministers, generals, members of the national security council.



Secretaries along the walls — pale, some trembling.

Some watch the screen.

Others cover their faces with their hands.



Suddenly — a loud bang.

The door swings open forcefully.



Enter Kenjiro Hirayama —

Minister of Defense.

One of the oldest and most influential politicians in the country.

Legendary, grim, with a piercing voice that usually spoke softly, but not today.



Behind him — security, advisors, a woman in a strict suit holding a folder.



He explodes:



— Who the hell gave that order?!



Silence.



He glances at the screen: missiles — launch, target, impact.

He looks back at them.



— Are you out of your minds?

— You ordered an attack on the city?!

— Live on air!?

— How the hell are we going to explain this?!



A voice from the corner:



— It was... General Naomi.

— Under the directive of the council chairman... Mori Kazuhiro.



A moment of silence.

All eyes turn to Kazuhiro —

A new-wave politician, cold, one who builds a career on crises.



He stands.

Calmly.



— We had no other choice.

— It was a decision of the military cabinet.

— He posed a threat to national security.



Hirayama:



— He!? That entity?!

— He didn't attack a single building.

— He didn't even... move!



Someone interjects:



— He burned people... just for lying.



Another attendee interrupts:



— And if tomorrow it says that thinking is a sin?

— Will we sit and stay silent then?



Woman with a tablet:



— The USA, China, France, and India... haven't attacked yet.

— We're the first. And the whole world... is already watching us.





Scene II — Cracks from Within



Same hall.

Doors still closed.

Silence after the explosion.

Only the hum of the screen.



Hirayama stands by the window, fists clenched.



Voices in the Japanese parliament hall begin to tremble.



Then one of the attendees, Shingo Yasuda,

Rises from the table, eyes gleaming.

He's trembling, but with excitement:



— You don't understand...

— This isn't an enemy.

— It's an angel.

— An angel of purification!

— Can't you see? He punishes lies! Isn't that sacred?!



— Are you out of your mind? — yells Hina Shizuko.

— We just attacked him over Tokyo. If this is God — we're already dead!



Yasuda walks to the center of the hall, hands clasped in prayer:



— So be it!

— We prayed for signs! He is the sign!



Ryo Aoba moves away from the table, backing towards the wall.



— We're... next.

— I feel it.

— He... knows. Knows everyone.



On the screen — a square in Paris, someone begins to burn.



Saito (general) breathes heavily.

He speaks quietly for the first time:



— We made the first strike.

— If he's not human... he won't forget.



And silence falls.



Scene III — He Didn't Disappear



Parliament.

Same hall.

The screen's light dims, and a new broadcast appears — the camera shakes, microphone noise.

...the camera slightly jolts.

Focus lost.



On the screen — Tokyo.

Thick smoke, like a vortex, swirls on the horizon.

Large buildings — in a gray haze.

People on the streets — some silent, some trembling, some already on their knees.



And suddenly — silence.



From the smoke, as if from a crack in the sky, he emerged.



Same figure.

Same silence.

No soot, no signs of damage.

He simply — returned.



A heaviness hung over Tokyo.

As if gravity itself trembled.



In the Japanese parliament hall — silence.

Someone slowly sank into a chair.

Someone covered their face with their hands.

Someone just stared. Unblinking.



On the screen — him.

Hovering, as if nothing happened.

As if the explosion never occurred.

As if it was all just a rehearsal.



Aoba whispers:



He hovers again in the air, in the same place where the strike just occurred.

As if... nothing happened.



The hall remains — silent...



Aoba whispers again:



— This is impossible...



Shizuko frantically taps on the tablet, eyes darting over the data.



— No pulsation. No thermal signature. No gravitational shift.

— He just... exists.



Yasuda falls to his knees in the hall. Right onto the carpet.



— Hallelujah...

— He has risen.

— He has forgiven.

— He gave us a sign...



Hirayama recoils from the screen, horrified:



— Forgiven?

— He's playing with us!

— This isn't mercy — it's a demonstration of power!



Kazuhiro (cold politician) still stands by the table.



He calmly watches the screen.



— He showed us that we are — helpless.

— And now everyone will lie to his face... silently.



He sits. For the first time during the entire time.

As if realizing there's no point in standing anymore.



On the screen:



People in Tokyo — begin to bow.

Some — fall to their knees.

Someone — raises their hands upward.



Scene IV — The Gaze



The sky over Tokyo — dark, but without a storm.

He said nothing.

No gesture. No sign.



Just — looked down.



Even those who didn't believe fell to their knees.

The streets became quieter than a temple.

And over the city — something hung.

Not fear. Not reverence.



Expectation.



The kind that presses harder than any truth.

Expectation... of a new word.



But he remained silent.



He simply was.

Like a shadow from the heavens.

Like a mystery no one dares to unravel first.



And below, among the crowd, someone wept —

not from fear,

but because

silence is scarier than punishment.",1,1748386724.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
