I'm an old person and I've only been on one cruise and never solo before.

1. Tipping: Gratuities are included, but do I tip the person who cleans my room? Is that someone different from the cabin steward? I've heard that if you're going to tip the cabin steward, do it at the end. But how do you do that? Assuming the service is good I would want to do this and if the person who cleans the room is different I'd want to tip as I would at a hotel. Is this acceptable or frowned upon? What about bartenders and servers? I have not purchased a drink package.
2. Drinking water: I don't drink soda and rarely drink alcohol. I'm a water drinker. Is tap water OK? Where's the best place to get drinkable water? I'm only bringing one suitcase so not bringing any beverages. I will bring two thermos cups though.
3. Is there coffee available all day at the Lido deck? If I want coffee first thing when I get up, do I tip for room service or is that part of the gratuities? I want to tip where applicable but not appear to be trying to buy special service.
4. How dressy is the main dining room? It's a group trip where I won't know anyone at first but the group will be dining together in the MDR. I do not wear dresses or skirts. I will have some nice black pants and dressy-ish sandals and a few lace tops.
5. I'm viewing this as a kind of ""wellness retreat."" I plan to eat healthy, go to the gym and/or walk the decks, do a lot of reading and some writing. Are the books in the library good or should I plan to bring more than one?
6. I booked fairly late so my cabin is towards the front. How much movement am I likely to feel while in the room?
7. I will probably stay on board ship at most of the ports. I have 25 Caribbean vacations under my belt in my adult life and I'm about beached out. And the excursions don't thrill me. BUT...I want to get coffee in Jamaica. Is there a duty free shop within the cruise port in Montego Bay where I can avoid the hassle of MoBay on cruise ship day? (19 of my 25 trips have been to Jamaica so I know the hustle/hassle scene there.)

I started going to an arts and crafts Meetup and a book club Meetup.

The arts and crafts meet up I loved, because it was a way of meeting all kinds of people who are into all kinds of hobbies. I even got to sit down and do one of the hobbies with one of the fellow women in my group and we bonded over that. The whole thing is set up to take place in a cafe, so it‚Äôs a nice atmosphere and you get to have a coffee with the ladies whilst you‚Äôre doing your hobby.

I then tried out a book club, which I thoroughly enjoyed because it wasn‚Äôt like traditional book clubs where you all read the same thing and all keep at the same pace, but rather it‚Äôs like you all get to read your own individual book for an hour and talk about what you‚Äôve read afterwards together.

I'm looking for some truly **decadent** gourmand suggestions. Think: caramel, toffee, dates, praline, vanilla, brown sugar, etc. I'm open to any variety of complimentary notes as well like coffee, almond, cream, pumpkin, spices, amber, woods, or fruits, as long as the star of the dry down is rich sweetness. Bonus points if it's something simple enough to be layered (but totally not necessary!)

My best examples are See's Candy butterscotch lollipops and Lush Sticky Dates lotion. The Sticky Dates body spray sadly smells awful on me and the Shaghaf Vanilla Toffee reviews are far too mixed for me to chance it (although it sounds so perfect on paper) so I hope I can find something lovely here.

I am not a fan of: chocolate, smoke, anything burnt, ""light"" sweets like marshmallow/milkshake/white sugar, or heavy musk.

To that end, I've found the following scents from **Lovesick Witchery** and I would love to hear some opinions from anyone who's tried them! **Date with the Devil, Half Dead Cafe, Harlot & Pumpkinhead.** 

Please give me your favorite sweet treats and/or thoughts on those scents! Thank you!!

The Dream of a LIFETIME incident occurred on July 9th of 2007, a man by the name ""Schwartz Profundus"". He one night was awake for too long, fatigue production started within his body. Every night Schwartz would stay awake, time after time drinking 5 to 10 cups of coffee. The sleepiness would continue to build up, he eventually stayed awake for 3 months, dramatic and horrifying changes arrived. Doctors would notice *disturbing* changes in his behavior, Schwartz would continuously say the words ""*DREAM*"", ""*LIFETIME*"", and ""*SLEEP*"".

Doctors and psychologists never knew what Schwartz meant, they put him into a nearby mental facility for more security measures. Schwartz would continue to have a look of fear and worry on his face, the concern and terror would only grow worse throughout the next 5 months. He would start to scream so loud, his vocal chords would nearly rip and break. Schwartz would bang his head against the wall to get the guards attention, soon enough his head would bleed intensely.

Guards would try to stop Schwartz from his s\*icide attempt, but failed to do so. He eventually cracked his skull, brain matter and bone was visible. The utter horrors were seen, no human could describe such *unnatural* occurrences within him. Schwartz fell dead onto the floor soon after, unconscious and gone. Decades later, he woke up after a coma. It was 2017, Schwartz told the surgeons and doctors that he saw a ""*red cloud cluster, extending to infinite darkness, lifetime seeming.*""",1,1731724824.0,DoctorNowhere,0,1.0,False

EpicMFan : Aujourd'hui, j'ai d√©cid√© d'aller dans un bar gay. Je ne sais pas encore lequel, mais il y en a plusieurs dans le Village. Mais d'abord, je prends le m√©tro pour aller √† Beaudry. Et bien s√ªr, quelqu'un m'a reconnu et s'est approch√© de moi.

La personne du m√©tro : Bonjour, vous √™tes le membre local ?

EpicMFan : Oui, c'est moi. Comment le savez-vous ?

La personne du m√©tro : Votre visage est imm√©diatement reconnaissable.

EpicMFan : Alors, quelle est votre question ?

La personne du m√©tro : Qu'est-ce qu'il y a avec les conservateurs ? Ils ne font que se plaindre, se plaindre, se plaindre. Aucun d'entre eux ne veut faire quoi que ce soit de notable. Et ils demandent √† tous ceux qui ne sont pas eux de d√©missionner.

EpicMFan : Tout le monde d√©missionne dans un monde conservateur. C'est irritant, n'est-ce pas ?

La personne du m√©tro : Je vais vous dire. J'ai toujours soutenu le Bloc. Mais leur nouveau leader. Aya. Elle est beaucoup plus √† droite que le Bloc d'autrefois. Il n'y a qu'un seul parti qui soutient mes visions !

EpicMFan : Personnellement, j'ai toujours soutenu le NPD. Surtout avec Jack Layton. Il √©tait cool, n'est-ce pas ?

La personne du m√©tro : Oui, c'est vrai. Et aussi, leur chef adjoint d√©teste les droits des femmes, y compris leur propre chef, putain ! J'ai besoin d'un verre apr√®s tout √ßa. Surtout que ma femme a avort√©.

EpicMFan : Bon, c'est mon arr√™t. Je ferais mieux de partir. Je vous souhaite bonne chance.

*EpicMFan se rend dans le premier bar gay qu'il trouve, appel√© Le Date.*

*EpicMFan se dirige vers un barman.*

EpicMFan : Vous avez des boissons sans alcool ?

Le barman : J'ai du caf√© alcoolis√©.

EpicMFan : C'est alcoolis√©. Dites-moi, que pensez-vous de la position des conservateurs sur les LGBT ?

Le barman : C'est absolument terrible. Je veux dire qu'ils ont un chef adjoint qui s'est oppos√© √† nous √† plusieurs reprises. Pour peu de raisons. Tout simplement parce que nous voulons √™tre ce que nous sommes.

EpicMFan : J'ai une fille transgenre, en fait, et je dirais que sous un gouvernement conservateur, elle ne pourrait jamais obtenir le soutien, l'≈ìstrog√®ne, tout ce qu'il faut.

Le barman : Je dois dire que les r√©centes nouvelles concernant les syndicats m'ont pris au d√©pourvu. Je fais √©videmment partie du syndicat du secteur priv√©, mais le syndicat du secteur public... il faut avoir piti√© de lui, non ? Parce que si ce n'est pas le cas, qu'est-ce que vous feriez ?

EpicMFan : Je ne sais pas... ce sont eux qui l'ont signal√©. Personnellement, j'en ai entendu parler et je suis solidaire des travailleurs dans cette situation. Surtout ceux qui sont soumis √† un environnement dangereux parce qu'ils sont LGBT.

Le barman : C'est difficile maintenant. Les meilleurs jours sont derri√®re nous. Mais les meilleurs jours sont aussi dans l'avenir.

EpicMFan : Il se fait tard et je dois √™tre au studio √† 9h45... √† plus tard.

EpicMFan: Today, I decided to go to a gay bar. I don't know which one yet, but there's a bunch in The Village. But first, I'm catching the Metro to get to Beaudry. And of course, somebody recognised me and came up to me.

Metro Person: Hi, are you my local member?

EpicMFan: Why, yes I am. How could you tell?

Metro Person: Your face is instantly recognisable.

EpicMFan: So, what's your question?

Metro Person: What is it with Conservatives? All they do is complain, complain, complain. None of them want to do anything of note. And they all call on everyone who isn't them to resign.

EpicMFan: Everyone resigns in a Tory world. It's irritating, isn't it?

Metro Person: I'll tell you what. I used to always support the Bloc. But their new leader. Aya. She's a lot more right wing than the Bloc of old. Only one party is supporting my visions!

EpicMFan: I personally was always an NDP supporter. Especially with Jack Layton. He was cool, wasn't he?

Metro Person: Yeah. And also, their deputy leader hates the rights of women, including their own fucking leader! I need a drink after all this. Especially considering my wife had an abortion.

EpicMFan: Well, this is my stop. I best be off. Best to you.

*EpicMFan goes to the first gay bar he finds, called Le Date.*

EpicMFan: This is Le Date, reportedly. A karaoke bar. I guess I could sing a song. But I'm not showing any of you.

*EpicMFan sings the song 'Headline News' by ""Weird Al"" Yankovic.*

EpicMFan: That was fun. Let's have a drink and see what people think.

*EpicMFan walks to a bartender.*

EpicMFan: You have any non-alcoholic drinks?

Bartender: I have alcoholic coffee.

EpicMFan: That's alcoholic. Tell me, what do you think about the Conservative's stance on LGBT?

Bartender: Absolutely terrible. I mean, they've got a deputy leader who has on multiple occasions gone against us. For little reason. Just because we wanna be who we are.

EpicMFan: I have a transgender daughter, in fact, and I would say that under a Conservative government she would never be able to get the support, the estrogen, the everything.

Bartender: I must say, the recent news about the unions struck me off guard. Obviously I'm part of the private sector union, but that public sector union... you best feel sorry for them, no? Because if not, then what would you do?

EpicMFan: I dunno... they're the ones reporting it. I personally did hear about it, and I stand in solidarity with the workers in this situation. Especially those who are put under an unsafe environment because they're LGBT.

Bartender: It's hard now. The best days are behind us. But the best days are also in the future.

EpicMFan: It's getting late, and I need to be at the studio by 9:45... well, see you later.

While in school, I spent four years working as a paid research assistant. Prior to that, I worked for two years doing similar work in high school. I also participated in four summer internships: two in physics research, one in software engineering, and one in data science. I also worked as both a teaching assistant and a tutor at my university.

I started job searching mid last summer after having caught wind of horror stories about people having graduated one, two, and even three years prior and not having yet found any meaningful work. I have since submitted just over 1,200 job applications, and haven‚Äôt yet found anything. I‚Äôve interviewed for two positions, and have received around 800 automated rejection emails.¬†

I‚Äôve re-written my resume five times. I currently have three different ‚Äústyles‚Äù of resume, each with a different level of complexity (for something like fast-food, I submit a ‚Äúdumbed down variant‚Äù; for technical jobs in industry, I reframe my research experience in more marketable terms; for work in academia, I speak more specifically to my research interests). I‚Äôve run all three by former bosses, professors, and (now twice) by my university‚Äôs career center.

I spend a significant amount of time (10-14 hours a day, across 1 or 2 applications) carefully tailoring my resume and cover letters. Some applications take days or weeks, with assignments, assessments, projects, essays and more involved. I reach out to recruiters, alumni, and others within the companies I apply to wherever possible. I have also sent hundreds of ‚Äúcold-emails‚Äù, whose format I‚Äôve also run by former bosses and the aforementioned career center. I am extremely careful so as to verify that I meet every single one of the listed requirements on each job posting. I have six references, from which I randomly pick 2-3 (and in some cases, I‚Äôve been asked for all 6) for each application so as to ensure that one or two references aren‚Äôt somehow getting in the way (I can‚Äôt imagine that any have anything less than positive to say, but I‚Äôm trying everything at this point).

I can‚Äôt seem to get a job doing *anything*. I‚Äôve been rejected for minimum wage, $7.25/hr fast-food jobs. I‚Äôve been rejected for research assistant jobs very similar to the same research assistant jobs I had as a student. A non-exhaustive list of industries and jobs I‚Äôve tried:

### Space-Saving Solutions

If you have a smaller living area, a rocker recliner loveseat is an excellent space-saving solution. Unlike oversized sectionals, loveseats are compact yet offer ample seating for two people. They fit nicely in corners or smaller rooms without crowding the space. Plus, their dual functionality as both a recliner and rocker means you can save room while still enjoying luxury.

### Health Benefits

You might be surprised to learn that your choice of seating can impact your health. Rocker recliner loveseats provide several benefits:

- **Improved Circulation:** The rocking motion encourages blood flow, which can reduce discomfort in your legs and back.
- **Reduced Stress:** The gentle rocking motion is soothing and can help alleviate stress and anxiety after a hectic day.
- **Back Support:** Reclining positions can take pressure off your spine, offering better lumbar support, which is especially beneficial for those with back pain.

### Enhanced Family Time

A rocker recliner loveseat is perfect for quality time with loved ones. Its cozy design encourages you to snuggle up next to family members. Whether it's movie night, game day, or simply chatting over coffee, this loveseat fosters a warm and inviting atmosphere. The ability to rock or recline adds a fun element to your gatherings, making them even more enjoyable.

### Easy Maintenance

Maintaining your rocker recliner loveseat can be simple, especially if you choose the right material. Many fabric options are removable and washable, while leather can be wiped down with ease. To ensure longevity:

### Affordability and Value

Rocker recliner loveseats are often more affordable than larger sectional options while still providing great style and comfort. When you compare the price with the features you get, such as reclining capability and rocking motion, you truly receive great value for your investment.

### Customization Options

Many manufacturers offer rocker recliner loveseats with customization options, allowing you to select the fabric, color, and additional features such as heat and massage functions.

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/rocker-recliner-loveseat  
  
- Seat Depth: Make sure the seat depth suits your height. A deeper seat might be more relaxing, while a shallower one could be better for shorter individuals.
- Back Support: Ensure the backrest provides adequate support for your lumbar region. A well-padded back can make all the difference in comfort.
- Cushion Firmness: The firmness of cushions influences comfort. Some prefer soft cushions, while others like a firmer feel.

### Size and Space

Measuring your available space is crucial. A loveseat can vary in size, so here‚Äôs what to keep in mind:

- Room Dimensions: Ensure the rocker recliner loveseat fits comfortably within your room without overwhelming the space.
- Doorway and Pathways: Check that the loveseat can enter your home and fit through doorways without trouble.
- Placement: Consider how the loveseat will fit into your living arrangement. It should complement other pieces in the room.

### Material and Durability

The material of your rocker recliner loveseat greatly affects its lifespan and maintenance. Here are common options to consider:

- Fabric: Soft and cozy, fabric loveseats come in many colors and patterns. However, they might require regular cleaning.
- Leather: While often more expensive, leather provides durability and elegance. It‚Äôs easy to wipe clean but can be sensitive to heat and sunlight.
- Microfiber: A great middle ground, microfiber is stain-resistant and comfortable, making it an ideal choice for homes with kids or pets.

### Style and Aesthetics

Your rocker recliner loveseat should reflect your personal style and fit in with your home decor. Consider the following factors:

- Color: Choose a color that complements your existing furniture and walls. Neutral tones can blend effortlessly, while bold colors can create a statement.
- Design: From traditional to modern, select a design that aligns with your style. Sleek lines and minimalist designs might suit contemporary homes, while ornate details work well in classic settings.
- Functionality: Think about additional features like built-in cup holders, USB charging ports, or adjustable reclining levels that make the loveseat more functional.

### Function and Usage

Think about how you will use the loveseat. Is it for lounging, movie nights, or accommodating guests? Here‚Äôs what to assess:

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/rocker-recliner-loveseat  
  
- Daily Use: If you plan to use it every day, focus on durability and ease of cleaning.
- Occasional Use: A stylish loveseat that looks great may suffice if it won‚Äôt see much action.
- Support Features: If you have any physical challenges, look for models with enhanced support or easier recline functionality.

### Price and Warranty

Budget is a significant factor. You don‚Äôt have to break the bank, but you should consider:

- Cost-Effectiveness: Balance quality with price. Sometimes, investing a little more in a durable loveseat pays off in the long run.
- Warranty Options: Look into warranties that protect your investment. A good warranty can offer peace of mind and protection against defects.

Finding the right rocker recliner loveseat involves considering comfort, space, materials, style, functionality, and budget. By carefully evaluating these factors, you can choose a piece that enhances your home while providing the ultimate in relaxation.

1gsde63,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gsde63/toxic_gf_or_am_i_an_asshole/,Toxic GF or am I an asshole?,"I just had a pretty shitty end of day with my girlfriend. We have been together for 5.5years now so we are quite deep into the relationship. The thing I'm struggling with at the moment is that every nice thing I do is appreciated for a second, but every thing I do that isn't 100% in her favour means that I get labelled as a shitty boyfriend. For example today. It was her birthday so this is how the day went:

0700: We wake up and I give her gifts (Jewellery) with a freshly brewed coffee in bed.

0730: I make her breakfast and we eat together at the breakfast bar and discuss plans for the weekend.

0800 - 1630: I start work. She has the day because that's how her shifts fell and I had used all my leave earlier in the year to travel to the Philippines for her mother's funeral, so I didn't have the ability to take it off. But I work from home so I check in with her through the day, she's pampering herself and chilling. I start and finish early because we have a dinner reservation.

1700: I drive us to the train station to go into town.

1730: Sit down to a three course meal with good wine in one of the fanciest restaurants in town. All on me of course.

2000-2200: We head to the bar and have more wine and chat for a while.

I ask if we can cut the night short. As Im tired after the long week in work and we have plans tomorrow to go out again partying anyway. She throws a paddy, saying ""I only care about myself and I never do nice things for her"". That I should go home by myself and she will stay out.

I literally am at her beck and call on a daily basis. She gets home from work there's a hot homecooked meal ready. She needs a lift to go out with her friends, my only question is ""when?"". She says ""I want to do X, we go do X, normally with me booking and arranging everything"", she says I'd like some dessert tonight, I go out to the shops. 

On top of this she does some nice things for me but only while she is doing them for herself.  For example, when she is getting ready for work, she wakes up early 5am and makes herself a coffee and puts the bedroom lights on so she can do her makeup, waking me up in the process. If I ask, she will pour me a mug as part of this routine. And I always show gratitude. But she doesn't let me forget it if she doesn't get her way on something at some other time. Her shift pattern normally means she has 4 full days off a week (I get the two weekend days and have more time in the evenings). On her days off she will invariably spend the morning cleaning because she likes the house to be spotless. I completely appreciate this and always say the house looks amazing. It's not an expectation I have or anything but I'd never diminish how nice it is that she does this. Butttt it always ends up being something she guilt trips me with and tries to make out that I'm not pulling my weight (completely ignoring that I keep the house tidy and do all the household chores on the 4days of the week that she is in work. I work at home so you know I give up my lunch breaks and my time in the evenings before she gets home to keep things up to scratch.

I know it's a lot above and I know it's only one side of the relationship. I just feel so underappreciated. I constantly feel like I am doing stuff just to avoid being put down. And I always have to compromise what I want to fit with what she wants. 

I just don't know if I'm being an asshole about all this or whether this is actually really unhealthy? I've tried to talk about it but it always just gets spun into a competition of who does the most, where anything I do doesn't count.",1,1731724240.0,dating,3,1.0,False

I live in Aotearoa/New Zealand and Summer is almost upon us.

I've been experimenting with ice cream which is going well, and I often just freeze ice cream mixture into ice block/popsicle forms.

However, I'd like to make some quicker/simpler coffee versions with cold brew and milk. They will need a stabiliser/emulsifer I imagine, and I wonder if soy lecithin will work?

So i planned for just a chill date of coffee and talking and getting to know each other and she said ‚Äúsounds fun! :)‚Äù Up until the date, we had very brief conversations and she asked what I was up to and stuff but overall just setting up the date. Day before there was a huge football game and she cold texted me asking if I was watching it and made small talk with me then ended with ‚Äúwe‚Äôll prob lose :( but tomorrow should be fun together!‚Äù 

So her interest is good. Date comes we hug talk, ask about each other, then the conversation eventually fizzles out and she hits me with the ‚Äúwell I have to go I have a lot of work to do‚Äù then we hugged again. I knew things weren‚Äôt good but texted her again day later and was thinking of a 2nd date and she responded a day later and said yes, set it up for the weekend but she cancelled day before and rescheduled to Monday but I had to take a little to think about if I wanted to further pursue and was also busy Monday. I suggested Tuesday and that‚Äôs when she said she was pretty busy these next few weeks and I said just let me know when you‚Äôre free. Obviously she never replied.

Now we bump into each other few times cus of similar groups, I say hi and she doesn‚Äôt even make eye contact with me‚Ä¶

Everyone told me date wasn‚Äôt bad and I didn‚Äôt really do anything wrong yet I feel like I fumbled and ruined it, especially since her interest was high initially.

So everyone is complaining about morals this and moral that, but let‚Äôs talk economics here. I‚Äôve since moved into furniture sales, so I can only give insight from my area of expertise, but these prospective tariffs are about to seriously fuck us over. Most furniture in the US (or at least in my company) is imported from manufacturers in Southeast Asia. China is also included. 

Ok, no big deal, furniture is gonna get expensive, but who can afford a house anyways? 

Does anyone realize how much shit comes from Southeast Asia? Electronics? Clothing? Out of season crops? Seafood? The wood we use for construction? The metal? The stone? Every single American industry imports something from across the world. And if it‚Äôs truly 100% American sourced, then it‚Äôs gonna be hella expensive. 

So yeah. Ok, prices are gonna go up. But hey as a salesman; if my prices go up, then I guess that means more money for me right? Well if I made commission; sure, but the cost of living also goes up, and likely I won‚Äôt be able to afford rent, and food, and clothing, and everything else I already struggle with.

I don't wanna be a bother. 

So, I've never even touched reddit or anything, but I don't think there's anyone else I can ask about this at this point, so I'll set the scene.

As a prolog: In elementary school I had hardly any friends, because I was, like, a freak, right. Until in 7th grade (we went from 1st to 8th grade from like 7 to 15 years old) I actually started talking to people and it was great! For two years until they all turned on me and left me for a stupid reason I won't get into now. So going into high school basically alone wasn't fun, but fuck it, I had hope. And I did make like one friend so that was chill but this isn't about her.

Back in the second grade of highschool one of the more popular girls in our class reached out to me and my (at the time) best friend and we quickly hit it off. All three of us were like inseparable but me and her especially.

It felt like she really understood me after all this time. She needed physical contact as much as I did (we held hands like all the time ppl thought we were dating, I think), we were both into that stupid minecraft server and marvel and we both loved talking about boys, because we were stereotypical like that. She found me funny and she listened to me. 

And of course she had her flaws, right. She was a straight cis girl that had trouble understanding who I was (genderfluid, panromantic, asexual), but the thing is that instead dismissing me or ignoring it she made an effort to TRY and understand me. I knew that the reasons she had trouble getting it was because she was in an entirely different environment all her life, so I didn't mind.
She had trouble understanding that sometimes the things she said were offensive, but I made an effort to help her and she listened. And she learned! She got so much kinder and more understanding, it was great.

We had sleepovers frequently, I'd go to her house every day after school and we'd talk about anything. Or even just sit in silence. I played boardgames with her dad, that was fun. 

I even got her to roleplay with me! She was super iffy about it, had never done it before and thought it was cringe. But I convinced her to make some ocs and me and our other friend roleplayed together with her for a bit, until me and PG(Popular Girl lets call her, she still was) had to split from BF(best friend, previously mentioned) since she didn't have as much time as us. So we spent every day roleplaying nonstop. During every break, during class, whenever. She got so invested in it. Every time I didn't respond for a couple hours she got so impatient. And we both loved pur characters so much. We did this for months. Years even actually, I think. This meant a lot to me, for also unrelated reasons. (unless you rlly wanna know but yeah)

She even got me to text the guy I liked at the time. She supported me even though she thought he was ugly and even though it didn't work out. But it's an experience I still fondly remember.

She was such a comfort to me. I knew she might be leaving to study abroad and it upset me so deeply because she was like home to me. She was someone I could talk about anything with and who I could hold whenever I needed it. And she got me to leave my house. And made an effort to come to my town. Even though we only knew eachother for like 2 years.

But no friendship ever lasts forever with me, and here's where my issue starts.

At some point during the end of our 3rd year and start of the 4th year of high school, BF started getting really paranoid. There were these guys at our school that scared her. Not because they were dangerous or anything. just because they were mean. She was terrified they'd make fun of her or even look at her, stuff like that.

And on our group chat she'd often bring up these concerns. I'd try to help her as best I could, not assume anything and just try to calm her down, but she'd snap at me anyway.

And sadly PG was even WORSE at giving advice and comforting people than I was. I hadn't managed to teach her how to be gentle yet, my bad.

They'd get into regular arguments over it, which led BF to leave our group chat like all the time.

Both of them grew more and more frustrated with eachother. PG couldn't deal with BFs anxiety, so she distanced herself from me and her at times to talk to her other friends while I had to stay behind, because I couldn't leave BF with noone to talk to. I didn't blame either of them for this and I didn't mind, because I loved them both. 

This continued for a while, but we were all still friends and would reconcile at the end of the day. 

Until one day it led to PG ditching me and BF to go and hang out with a bunch of other people for new years. She lied to me about why she made that choice which frustrated me, but I forgave her. BF wasn't as happy, though, but I tried to convince her otherwise.

Atleast me and her could meet for new years, right?

Like literally a day before christmas me and BF got into a huge argument. She got unreasonably angry at me for a stupid joke. (I said ""new year same me im not changing for shit"" in the middle of a conversation and she said that ""maybe i should""[because we were meant to go to college soon and she thought I was lazy] so we spiraled into an argument)

This lasted until after new years. I spent it alone.

We were avoiding eachother at school, until PG actually made the effort to speak to BF and they both came up to me so she could apologize. I'm quick to forgive, we were back to normal.

For a week or two.

After that, BF and PG fought about those stupid fucking guys again. And we are coming up on the mistake that I made.

They weren't speaking to eachother. PG was basically only talking to her other friends and rarely me. Doesn't help she got a boyfriend at the time and stopped talking to me about him. I think her old friends were influencing her again.

I still talked to BF, tried to be normal. One day I texted her to try and get them to speak to eachother again, to make up.

BF instead went on a whole rant about how selfish and egotistical PG was. She said some mean shit because she was frustrated.

I tried to relay the valuable information hidden between insults to PG.

But she cut me off and asked me to just send her screenshots instead.

And I did. Like a fucking idiot.

I panicked and I did because I was already emotional.

Obviously PG was hurt. She told me she never wanted to talk to BF again and that their friendship was over. I tried to be comforting, I don't know if it worked.

I told BF what happened and she didn't care.

PG stopped talking to us. I mean she texted me sometimes but it was scarce. And when I spoke up her responses were barely there. Short and dismissive. (stopped roleplaying, also)

I still talked to BF, because I couldn't leave her. She was sad, she was struggling and she was alone aside from me. I couldn't just ditch her. Maybe that's what made PG hate me, I don't know yet.

After a few days I asked PG what was wrong and if we could work it out. We talked a bit and she started getting aggressive with me. She started blaming me. She said I was the one not talking to her. I told her I wasn't comfortable just coming up to people out of nowhere and trying to talk to them, I didn't know how. She said I should just get over it and get out of my comfort zone.

I asked her if she didn't care about my feelings at all and she said that yeah, she doesn't. 

I cried then and I told her to go fuck herself. It was harsh, but I panicked.

This was just before prom. It felt like something was missing the entire time. I still had fun but I wish that she would've spoken to me then instead of looking at me with resentment.

Time skip to now. High school is over. I took a gap year because I needed a break.

But now most of my friends are in college, busy. I either don't text them because I don't want to bother them or when I do they just don't respond.
My other friends either have other, better friend groups, or are just so sad that I can't handle helping them every day. Or burdening them with my problems, so I'm explaining this to you now instead.

I still follow PG on instagram. I saw her post about watching movies with some college friends recently. And meeting up with our old classmate for coffee. And I started to get sad, obviously.

I read through pur old rp groups while looking for something too, those were so fun. There's so many things I would've done better, but I can't now.

Read through some of our regular gc too, that stung. Shouldn't have done that. We were gonna live together and see eachothers weddings or whatever else she said.

So I was just... Wondering. 

If maybe I should say sorry?

I'm not expecting anything to come of it, really. Or maybe I am.

But ending such a good thing on such a terrible note really makes me upset. It makes me feel so guilty. Most of my friendships have ended on a sour note but this one really fucking hurts for whatever reason.

I think I should say sorry because I handled that situation so terribly. When me and BF were fighting, PG pulled through and helped us get along, but when I had to do it I ruined our friendship forever. I feel like I fucked it up for BF too.

Or maybe I should just ask her if she can mute our rp group chat so I can talk about my characters there. That would be nice to have. But I'm scared she'll just ignore me then. Or tell me to fuck off or something.

Extra context, though: I haven't left the house for like 3 months. I haven't met up with anyone aside from family once. I have only one friend to talk to and he's so sad that most days I choose not to because I'm so tired of trying to help and failing. I only really talk to my brother when he comes home from college and my parents sometimes. But that's about it.
I guess I post online which is fun, but yeah. It seems its not enough.

So maybe all this regret is the isolation talking. Maybe I need like a cat or something. I have a snake she's not very... huggable.

Anyway sorry for making you sit through all that! I'm an aspiring writer, can you tell?

This was kind of nice to get off my chest, though. It kind of helped? Not fully, obviously, because I'm still gonna post it, but a little.

Thank you for your attention! I love you! Truly, I hope you're alright.",1,1731723379.0,lostafriend,0,0.99,False

Now I  am trying to go from pantoprazole 40.to 20 after barely 3 weeks to heal my mild chronic gastritis and my stomach is furious.

 A little background here...Heartburn for me was rare until my two pregnancies. After the second, it got better but did not go away. I started having occasional esophageal spasms thay lasted over an hour. They came at night when I was tired and stressed. My gallbladder started to lag a few months ago and once I heavily restricted my diet all the reflux type stuff got worse and worse. I cut out gluten and it got even worse. I felt like there were bricks in my chest and even after my gallbladder was removed it stuck around. I went to the ER cause I was so recently post-op and they just have me pepcid which did nothing.
My surgeon recommended a short course of pantoprazole while I healed and the GI doctor said the same, only a smaller dose for a longer time (8 weeks as opposed to 2). I was scared of PPI withdrawals but after a month of feeling nausea every morning and the globus and brick in the chest sensation I caved and took 40 mg cause it was all the pharmacy had for a while. While I did have contraction-like stomach cramps the morning nausea eased a little, finally.  A bit over two weeks later I didn't take it for 2 days, intending to space out the doses and felt gross but it was bearable. The pharmacy finally filled the 20s so I started that but my stomach has been off and on burning and in pain ever since. I have to eat a small snack at 4 a.m. to feel slightly less awful in the morning. I rarely ever drink and cannot even tolerate coffee, I can no longer take nsaids and rarely did to begin with.

This happened about a year or so ago in a casino parking lot. For context, my state has a lot of Native American reservations and every reservation has their own casino, so there‚Äôs a significant number of casinos in my state with most being open on a 24/7 basis. 

Due to a series of terrible, traumatic events, I‚Äôd become homeless about few months before this robbery occurred and had been living in my car - a Range Rover - ever since. I quickly found these casinos were a godsend when you‚Äôre homeless because they provided 24/7 access to restroom facilities (something that can otherwise be extremely difficult to find, and absolutely necessary as a female). On brutally cold winter nights when I couldn‚Äôt afford the gas to run my car for the heat, they were also a source of shelter, warmth, and unlimited free coffee and soda. So despite not having any money for gambling, I frequented casinos quite regularly. 

There are several reasons why I am finally telling this story in the Dumb Criminals subreddit, starting with me being the worst possible target and then the actual robbery itself. 

First, on the day of the robbery, I was waiting for my ex to show up (also homeless at the same time and for the same reasons as me, we‚Äôve remained friendly) as we had a hotel booked about an hour away and were going to leave my car parked at the casino to save on gas. I was exhausted (sleep is hard to come by especially at night when you‚Äôre homeless) and got to the casino a few hours early, parked in the outdoor parking lot in front of the casino where security rarely frequented, and took a nap.

Reason number two: this was on a weekday, in the middle of the day, meaning there were a decent number of open spots in the parking lot. My car was parked as far from the doors as physically possible. Had even a single brain cell existed among them, the distance from the casino coupled with the length of time I‚Äôd been parked there should have been a dead giveaway I wasn‚Äôt there to gamble and didn‚Äôt have pockets full of money. If any of them did possess any brain cells, they must have been instantly silenced upon seeing that my car was a Range Rover, albeit an extremely dirty one. 

When the robbery occurred, I was actually outside my car, having walked around to the rear passenger door to start packing my stuff for the hotel so I‚Äôd be ready to just jump in the truck and leave when my ex arrived. I‚Äôd been doing that for about 3-5 minutes when a car sped towards me and then slammed on the brakes behind my car blocking me in. Before they were even out of the car I knew what was happening and had already shut the back door, opened the front passenger door, and had put myself in position to grab my own 9mm handgun (legally owned and registered fyi) off the passenger seat. Unfortunately I hadn‚Äôt had enough time to actually grab it as there was a bunch of stuff piled on top of it (had to keep it out of sight on casino property, plus everything I had left in the world was also in that car). 

The thing that actually surprised me was it was two African American WOMEN that got out of the car, one of whom had a gun. She acted confident but the way she was holding it was a dead giveaway she was not comfortable with it and unlikely to use it. They tell me this is a robbery give us your cash. I told them, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any cash, I‚Äôm homeless and live in this car, I‚Äôm just waiting to meet someone here.‚Äù Logic says this is the point when they should have gotten back in their car and found a new victim, but of course logic requires brain cells. 

Reason number three: one of them tells me to turn out my pockets. As I put my hands in to my pockets (and this is the reason I am not posting this story from my main account) I suddenly remember the ounce of crystal I had purchased for my ex and I before arriving at the casino, as well as the $60 cash I had left over from buying it. My car keys are also in my pockets. Obviously not keen on giving them any of that, I looked them dead in the eye and said ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs absolutely nothing in my pockets.‚Äù And somehow they believed me. No one checked. You truly have to be another kind of dumb to rob someone and not double check when they tell you they have nothing in their pockets. 

At this point the other woman who didn‚Äôt have a gun walks around to the drivers side and opens the drivers door and starts looking in the car, so I‚Äôm obviously watching her and no longer paying attention to the woman with the gun, also using that opportunity to move myself closer to being able to grab my gun off the seat. My only fear was them finding it before I grabbed it and taking it off me and there was no chance I was about to let that happen. 

The first thing she spots though is my phone sitting in the cup holder between the seats. At that time I had a phone case with a card holder on the back where I kept my ID and debit cards. Losing my ID would have been shitty af as you need ID to get into all the casinos, and I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to check in to the hotel later that night without it either. 

I fully expected she was going to take my phone, but I‚Äôd had so much stolen from me in the preceding months that I was pretty much numb at that point. I just didn‚Äôt want to lose my ID so I shouted at her, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare take my fucking ID.‚Äù This in turn pissed off the woman with the gun who suddenly seemed to realize I was paying absolutely no attention to her, and then shouted at me, ‚ÄúDid I say you could speak? This is a robbery. I have a gun pointed at you. I could shoot you. Do you want me to shoot you?‚Äù I just shrugged and said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take my fucking ID.‚Äù I should point out, this was nowhere near the first time I‚Äôd had a gun pointed at me, including a few instances where I did truly think I was going to die, and as I mentioned earlier I immediately had the impression that she had no intention of actually pulling the trigger. (If this post gets anyone type of attention inevitably someone is going to declare that this is another reason why we need gun control. Most of the time my beliefs would be labeled liberal, I used to consider myself a strong Democrat - these days more an independent who leans Democrat - but as the actual person who experienced not just this but the multiple other occasions where I‚Äôve had a gun pointed at my head and not someone who is just reading about it: there is not one single time including the times I thought for sure I was about to die that I thought ‚Äúthis is why we need gun control‚Äù. And in this particular instance I was extremely grateful I had my gun and my only regret in that moment was that I hadn‚Äôt grabbed it faster. Do not use what happened to me to claim we need laws that will only leave people helpless to defend themselves and embolden criminals who can commit crimes without worrying that their victims might also be armed. I absolutely guarantee you that the gun these girls had was not legally purchased and certainly not registered to any of them. Gun laws would not have kept it out of their hands. And if you think it‚Äôs far fetched or some cheap excuse when people say all stricter gun laws will do is keep guns out of the hands of law abiding citizens without even slightly decreasing gun possession amongst criminals, you are overwhelmingly naive to what the world is really like. You learn a lot of things being homeless, and one of the things that was very quickly apparent was that if you want a gun all you have to do is ask a couple people and you‚Äôll have one as soon as the same day, and often for less than they cost to purchase at a store. The fact that I was also armed that day was the only equalizer between me and them and the I truly think the main thing that kept me calm and in control.) So that plus the actually extremely traumatic few months of hell I‚Äôd just endured meant I had absolutely zero capacity for fear and honestly didn‚Äôt care if I lived or died. 

Reason number four: my car was absolutely PACKED with stuff, which I‚Äôm sure did seem overwhelming to them, however anything of value ($200 headphones, my wallet with a few sentimental pieces of diamond and gold jewelry stored in the coin compartment, my $3000 MacBook, $1000 surface pro, and of course my 9mm Sig) was all in the front passenger seat, and most of that in my purse that‚Äôs just sitting on the seat in plain sight. Rather than looking herself, the one without the gun says to me, ‚ÄúYea, this is a robbery, if you want to live you better give us a reason to leave. You‚Äôve got something in this car hand it over.‚Äù 

This was in fact the exact opportunity I needed to grab my gun and I had no intention of wasting that, though didn‚Äôt want to make it obvious there was something I didn‚Äôt want them to see, so just repeated what I‚Äôd said before, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm homeless, I have nothing.‚Äù But added that I would try and find something and start shuffling things on the passenger seat. My hand was quite literally INCHES from my gun when the girl who was holding the gun either got spooked or suddenly realized how long they‚Äôd been standing there on a live, monitored security feed pointing a gun at me (or she actually once again just believed what I was saying? Like maybe thought people can‚Äôt lie with a gun pointed at them? Idk) and told her friend ‚ÄúFuck this, this bitch ain‚Äôt got shit, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù 

Realizing the other one still had my phone and ID I once again demanded they give me back my fucking ID. Rather than taking my ID out of the card case and walking off the phone, this girl actually takes one single debit card and tosses my phone with my ID and other cards back in the car. I actually needed that debit card so that pissed me off so I called her a fucking bitch, which resulted in the gun being once again put right in my face and was the only point I thought she might actually use it, apparently feeling the need to defend her friend (girlfriend?), as she said, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck did you just say? Say that shit again and I will shoot you.‚Äù That gave me the opportunity I needed to take a step back and reposition myself just enough to actually grab my gun. I am honestly not a violent person, and for many reasons I was hoping to not have to use it, though mostly I really was not in the mood to deal with having to go to a police station and possibly get charged, though I‚Äôm almost 100% certain due to the significant security footage of the whole incident if I had used my gun it would have been ruled self defense, and also I didn‚Äôt want to have to potentially explain to the casino security why I had a gun on property (I did actually confess that I had the gun and even that I was trying to get to it to both the police and casino security while giving my statement after the fact, and the reaction from both was that going for the gun was the right thing to do and the casino seemed to take no issue with it so long as it didn‚Äôt leave my car). 

However, I also hate being told what to do to the point that even if I wanted to do what you told me to do and was even about to do it, I am probably gonna now do the exact opposite rather than let you think you‚Äôve won and that you have any kind of power over me. So I replied, ‚ÄúThat bitch stole my debit card. It doesn‚Äôt even work.‚Äù Which was actually true, as I always froze my debit cards and only unfroze them when I needed to use them then immediately froze them again. Even if that hadn‚Äôt been the case, by leaving my cell phone, they‚Äôd left me the means of freezing/canceling the card within seconds of them driving away and long before they‚Äôd even get the chance to attempt using it, which is reason number five these were some of the dumbest criminals ever to attempt a crime. Reason number six is: they did in fact attempt to use the card (on Amazon, which if successful would have meant a delivery address at the very least, and considering the lack of thought they gave everything else, I wouldn‚Äôt be at all surprised if they‚Äôd used their real amazon account with their actual identity and home address), but Amazon didn‚Äôt even attempt to charge my account for almost 3 hours AFTER the robbery took place. As I don‚Äôt know what they attempted to order, I really don‚Äôt know if that means they waited 3 hours to even try and use the card or if they did try and use it right away but forgot that Amazon doesn‚Äôt actually charge the card until it ships the order, making it quite possibly the worst place to try and use a stolen card before the owner can report it stolen. 

I‚Äôve often wondered in the year since what would have happened if the one who had stolen my debit card hadn‚Äôt already made it to their car and shouted to her friend ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go!‚Äù Would she have shot me for doubling down on calling her friend a bitch? If she hadn‚Äôt run back to the car in that moment, it was only seconds before she was about to find a gun aimed at her. Would she have shot me the second she realized what was happening? Would she have left? Would I have shot her? More than likely if she hadn‚Äôt immediately left or surrendered upon seeing my gun I would have shot her before she took it as the reason she needed to shoot me. I do wish I could have seen that moment of realization that I was not the weak, unarmed victim they‚Äôd taken me for but I am glad that I didn‚Äôt have to shoot anyone that day. While I would have loved to see them arrested, I do believe that no one gets to that point without having experienced significant pain and trauma and struggle in their own lives. While that doesn‚Äôt justify their actions, their actions wouldn‚Äôt have made their death any less tragic. It‚Äôs a fucked up world we live in. 

This story actually happens to be a story about the world‚Äôs dumbest police as well. As they drove off I was in fact able to get the license plate of the car. One thing that‚Äôs important to know about me, I struggle with certain elements of visual memory, with faces being the most difficult. Even if they hadn‚Äôt worn masks, there would have been ZERO chance I could have provided their description to the police beyond: female, African American. I can‚Äôt even remember how tall they were. Cars are also VERY difficult for me to remember, and I often rely on things like license plates and make/model when having to remember an unfamiliar vehicle (such as friends cars, rental cars, or my own the first month or two I own them). I can remember words, letters, numbers, even conversations from years and years ago with almost perfect clarity and recall, but not what something looked like. On one occasion, I met up with a girl from college whom I had a group project with at a McDonald‚Äôs. The plan was to go from the McDonald‚Äôs to the apartment of a 3rd group member when they got off work, who was a friend of the girl I met up with. This was before everyone had google maps on their phone so it had been decided the easiest thing to do would be to have me follow the other girl from the McDonald‚Äôs. It ended up being 2.5 hours before the 3rd group member called and said to come on over (we were expecting it to be about 15 minutes), but ultimately we ended up getting along great and spent that whole time chatting, though we each stayed in our own cars just rolled the windows down. Which meant I spent 2.5 hours essentially staring at this girls car. Just as we‚Äôre about to head off the apartment, she decides she‚Äôs hungry and wants to go through the drive through first. She says just follow her when I see her come out of the drive through. She drove a Cadillac, not a ton of those, so I just start repeating to myself ‚Äúfollow the Caddy‚Äù and watching for a Caddy to exit the drive through. I guess they were busy or slow because more time than I‚Äôd have thought had passed when a Caddy finally exits the drive through, and so of course, I follow. I followed that Caddy for damn near 20 minutes until it arrived at a gated private garage, entered said garage, then quite literally stopped just beyond the gate preventing me from following them in to the garage. A gated garage had never been mentioned to me previously, and I recalled being told this person only lived less than 10 minutes from the McDonald‚Äôs, which was when it finally dawned on me that I had followed the wrong Caddy the entire fucking time. Y‚Äôall: they were not even similar. The one I followed was black and damn near brand new. Hers was light colored and about 20 years old. The 15 or so minutes that passed while she was in the drive thru were all it took to wipe the memory of the car I‚Äôd just spent 2.5 hours staring at from my brain. 

Over the years I‚Äôve learned tricks to cope with this lack of visual memory, and I was absolutely determined that at the very least I was going to be able to describe the damn car. I got the license plate number, the color, and the make. They sped off too fast for me to see what the model was and no chance in hell I can see a car and just know what it is unless it‚Äôs something truly unique. I called 911 and told them what had happened and provided the most articulate and calm description of the car and the 3 occupants (never saw the driver, but there was in fact a 3rd person driving the car). 

I found out from casino security that they actually drove to the employee parking lot (only other outdoor lot, I‚Äôm guessing they didn‚Äôt know it was for employees) after they left me and attempted to rob another woman, who I guess was really shaken up and traumatized by the whole ordeal, but also had absolutely no cash as she was an employee not a patron.

The cops who arrived to take my statement asked me for a description of the car, and I provided them with the EXACT SAME THING I‚Äôd told 911 on the call. What was their response? ‚ÄúOh, we actually saw that car I know exactly which car it is. We drove past them on the way in here.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know if the 911 operator failed to pass along the car description or if the cops failed to pay attention to it but that has to be the absolute worst police work imaginable. Adding to that, he‚Äôd felt something was off about the car as they drove past which is why he remembered seeing it, but for some unknown reason he didn‚Äôt run the plate (and apparently neither did dispatch despite it being provided on the 911 call) because if he had run the plate then and there he would have discovered the car was stolen. He then made the decision that there was no chance they wouldn‚Äôt have dumped the car by now, despite having driven the car at least 4 hours and across state lines after having stolen it, so it wasn‚Äôt worth issuing an alert. Every aspect of this crime: the stupidity of the criminals, the casino security somehow having no idea this was occurring despite their being a live video feed playing right in front of them for at least 5 minutes (they did confirm it was caught on camera, but were oblivious until I went and told them what had happened), and the cops literally driving right past the criminals, noticing them, and letting them get away is just the most what the fuck just happened case of incompetency I think I‚Äôve ever encountered. I honestly feel a bit of impostor syndrome when I tell this story knowing people assume this was in some way a negative, traumatic, or otherwise scary experience for me when at the end of the day I just find the overwhelming incompetence of both the criminals and law enforcement amusing and possibly a little bit depressing. 

TLDR: two women saw that I was driving a Range Rover and parked at a casino and tried to rob me but I was homeless, had been parked sleeping in my car for hours, and was obviously not there for the casino as I‚Äôd parked as far from the entrance as physically possible despite plenty of open parking. They believed me when I said I didn‚Äôt have anything in my pockets even though I did, ignored my purse containing most of my valuables despite it being right in front of them, had expected me to be scared of the gun and struggled to keep control of the situation when they realized I wasn‚Äôt, and gave me the perfect opportunities to actually get to my own gun they didn‚Äôt know I had but left before I had to use it.

I literally wish I could eat food like a normal person. My whole life revolves around calorie counting.even if the food is low calorie, I still weigh it.  

I can't go out to eat unless I know there will be calorie counts on the menu. In the instance I do eat out it's always simple foods I could just eat at home since I'm able to better estimate the calories. 

I can't just enjoy a Starbucks drink. I always have to find the low calorie options, and even still count it for a whole daily meal.. When making coffee at home, I literally weigh my coffee on a scale to measure how much creamer I put in it. 

Sometimes I literally go home on my lunch break from work simply to throw up food. Sometimes I buy a dozen donuts that I don't even like simply to purge them.

When working out I get so light headed and feel like throwing up or passing out. 

Sometimes I wish I has a boyfriend, but idk I already have so many other issues in my head, and then to have this one habit that would actually be noticeable... no one will ever like me the way I am. One guy I briefly dated... I literally tried throwing up in my sink while he was in the shower because he brought me cinnamon rolls. I've thrown up at work, and I've though about throwing up while eating out but my fear of public bathrooms won that argument.

And I know that it's not healthy... but honestly being thin is the only thing that makes me feel good about myself.",1,1731722430.0,EDAnonymous,0,1.0,False

An unpaid internship has to provide real, educational content to the intern it seemed like Rory received very little direction and was used primarily as an assistant. Fetching coffee, distributing files and papers, etc. are assistant duties and if that is the bulk of the workload for the intern that is not an internship. 

Of course she may have had proper direction off screen, but based on what we saw, it‚Äôs my belief that she could have reported that ‚Äúinternship‚Äù to the department of labor and won a case. 

Now, as for Mitchum being unreasonably harsh. It‚Äôs insane to expect an unpaid undergrad to take initiative in their first few months in an office. And he freely admitted that they hadn‚Äôt talked about the internship until that point which means he never provided any coaching. He should have structured things so that she would take on progressively more responsibility and provided a path for her to go above and beyond.

Hey there! This my first time really putting myself out there so here goes:) I‚Äôm looking to make a real authentic connection with someone whether it‚Äôs online, or US. If you‚Äôre in california or socal specifically that‚Äôs even better but it‚Äôs not a deal breaker if you‚Äôre not. I‚Äôve been trying to practice patience when it comes to meeting someone, but sometimes you have to get up and go get it! So here‚Äôs a little bit about myself:

I really love music. It‚Äôs definitely my first love language. I sing and song-write in my free time and I love sharing new music to listen to with the people around me, especially my friends and family(would love to share some with you too). It‚Äôs been my passion for as long as I can remember. Fun fact: My family says that before I said my first words, I was humming songs. So it‚Äôs been a big part of my life for many years. It‚Äôs a passion I would love to share with you, too.

Nature. What a beauty mother nature is , right? I love taking nature walks and bird watching. Besides music and cars, I love to nerd out about animals.

Cars are another thing I really love. The car community can be very toxic sometimes, but I keep an open mind to everyone and how they feel. I really like high performance sports cars and super cars. I remember going to my first cars and coffee here in California and it was the first time I saw so much carbon fiber in person. 

Literature. Love it. Need it. I love poetry than any other form(need romantic poems daily, I‚Äôm your guy!)

Video games, anime, and sports are some of my favorite things to indulge in when I need to distress and take a break from it all(but I would love to add conversations with you to that list:))

Academics is also a big center of my life as I‚Äôm in college right now. I would love to discuss anything about your experience as well. I think my favorite courses I‚Äôm taking are my American Sign Language course and my Physiological Psychology course(I‚Äôm a psych major!!)

That‚Äôs just a little bit about me, but why don‚Äôt you come and tell me a little bit about yourself? I‚Äôd love to talk with you. Also thanks if you read this far, tell me your favorite memory associated with music when you hit me up:)",1,1731722072.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1gsco32,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadviceformen/comments/1gsco32/youre_dying_so_am_i_now_what_hint_ask_her_out/,You're Dying. So Am I. Now What? (Hint: Ask Her Out),"Let's cut to the chase. 

We're all on a one-way trip to the grave. 

Every pizza slice, every tequila shot, every Netflix binge ‚Äì it's all just a countdown to the final curtain call. Morbid? Maybe. 

Motivating? Hell yes.

Now, I wasn't always this philosophical. Just a few years ago, I was wallowing in a pity party of epic proportions. 

Bills were piling up like unread emails, my love life was drier than a burnt toast, and I was pretty sure my dog was judging me for spending an entire weekend in my pajamas.

But then, something shifted. 

It wasn't a near-death experience or a divine intervention. 

It was a simple realization: time waits for no man (or woman, for that matter). 

And if I didn't start living with intention, my tombstone would read, ""Here lies a guy who spent most of his life scrolling through social media and wondering what could have been.""

Now, I'm not saying you should quit your job, sell all your possessions, and join a traveling circus (although, if that's your thing, go for it!). 

But I am saying that life is too damn short to play it safe. It's time to ditch the ""what ifs"" and embrace the ""hell yeahs!""

And that brings me to the point of this whole existential rant: **ASK HER OUT!!!!!!!**

Yes, you. The one reading this, heart pounding, palms sweating, wondering if she'll say yes. The one who's been crafting the perfect opening line in your head for weeks, but can't seem to muster the courage to actually hit send.

Listen up, my friend. You're not getting any younger. Neither is she. And that cute barista with the killer smile? She's not going to wait forever.

Life is a fleeting dance, a whirlwind of moments that disappear faster than free drinks at a casino. 

Don't waste it on hesitation and fear. Take the plunge. Ask her out. 

The worst that can happen is she says no. 

And then? You move on. 

There are plenty of other fish in the sea, my friend. 

But you won't catch any of them if you're too afraid to cast your line.

I used to be the king of missed opportunities. I'd spend hours agonizing over the perfect approach, crafting witty banter in my head, only to chicken out at the last minute. I'd watch as the girl of my dreams walked away, probably thinking I was either mute or incredibly rude.

Then, one day, I had an epiphany. I was at a friend's wedding, surrounded by love and laughter, when it hit me: life is too short to be a spectator. I grabbed a glass of champagne, marched over to the most beautiful woman in the room, and introduced myself.

And guess what? She said yes. We danced, we laughed, and we ended up having an amazing conversation. 

Did we end up getting married and living happily ever after? 

No. But that's not the point. 

The point is, I took a chance. I stepped outside my comfort zone. And I created a memory that I'll cherish forever.

Now, I'm not saying you should go around hitting on every woman you see. 

That's creepy, and frankly, a recipe for disaster. 

But I am saying that you should be bold, be confident, and be willing to put yourself out there.

So, what are you waiting for? 

Close this browser window, open your dating app, and send that message. 

Take her out for coffee, a drink, a walk in the park, whatever floats your boat. 

Just do it.

1gscimj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarAddOns/comments/1gscimj/ceramic_coating_from_skeptic_to_believer_my/,Ceramic Coating - From Skeptic to Believer - My Two-Year Journey üöó‚ú®,"After two years of experience with ceramic coating on my daily driver (2020 BMW M3) and weekend toy (1995 Mazda Miata), I figured it's time to share my comprehensive experience with the community. This isn't just another ""ceramic coating is amazing"" post - I'll be sharing both the highs and lows, including some embarrassing mistakes I made along the way.

# What is Ceramic Coating? ü§î

Before we dive deep, let's break down what ceramic coating actually is. **Spoiler alert:** it's not actually ceramic in the way you might think!

Ceramic coating is a liquid polymer that, when cured, creates a molecular bond with your vehicle's factory paint. The science behind it is fascinating:

# The Chemistry Behind the Magic ‚öóÔ∏è

The main components include:

* Silicon dioxide (SiO2) - *The primary protective component*
* Titanium dioxide (TiO2) - *Adds hardness and UV resistance*
* Various polymers and resins - *Creates the bonding structure*
* Specialty solvents - *Allows for even application*

*Fun fact:* The same basic technology was originally developed for industrial applications in aerospace!

# Benefits of Ceramic Coating: Real-World Experience ‚ú®

# Protection Against Environmental Hazards

Living in Arizona, my cars face:

* Brutal sun exposure (115¬∞F/46¬∞C summers)
* Dust storms
* Random monsoon rains
* The occasional hailstorm

**Before coating:** My M3's black paint looked like it had been sandblasted after just one dust storm. **After coating:** Two years later, the paint meter shows minimal clear coat degradation.

# The Hydrophobic Effect üíß

*Personal story time:* Last month, I did a little experiment. I parked my coated M3 next to my brother's uncoated M4 during a rainstorm. The difference was night and day:

|Aspect|Coated M3|Uncoated M4|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Water Beading|Perfect spheres|Flat water spots|
|Dirt Retention|Almost none|Visible residue|
|Drying Time|15 minutes|45+ minutes|
|Water Spots|None|Visible after drying|

# Enhanced Appearance: Beyond the Showroom Shine üåü

Let me tell you about what happened at our local Cars & Coffee. My *Alpine White* M3 was parked next to a similar uncoated one, and the difference was so noticeable that the other owner asked me what ""special paint option"" I had ordered! The depth and reflection are on another level.

# Types of Ceramic Coatings: A Detailed Breakdown üìä

# Professional Grade Coatings

|Brand Example|SiO2 %|Durability|Cost Range|Hardness (H)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Premium Tier|90-95%|5-7 years|$1500-2500|9H|
|Mid Tier|80-85%|3-5 years|$800-1500|9H|
|Entry Tier|70-75%|2-3 years|$500-800|7H|

# Consumer Grade Coatings

|Type|SiO2 %|Durability|Cost Range|Hardness (H)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Premium DIY|60-70%|2-3 years|$150-300|9H|
|Basic DIY|40-60%|1-2 years|$50-150|5H-7H|
|Spray On|15-30%|6-12 months|$20-50|3H-5H|

# The Application Process: My Experience üîß

*Warning: Long section ahead, but worth the read!*

# Professional Installation on the M3

**Day 1: Preparation**

* Paint correction (12 hours)
* Clay bar treatment
* IPA wipes
* Surface preparation

**Day 2: Application**

* Base coat application
* Curing time
* Top coat application
* Final inspection

# DIY Adventure on the Miata üõ†Ô∏è

*This is where I learned some hard lessons...*

**What I Did Right:**

* Invested in proper lighting
* Used high-quality products
* Took my time (3 full days)

**What I Did Wrong:**

* Rushed the paint correction
* Applied too thick in some areas
* Didn't control the environment well enough

# Common Misconceptions: Myth vs. Reality ‚ö†Ô∏è

# Myth 1: ""It's Completely Scratch Proof""

**Reality:** While my M3 has resisted minor scratches, I still got a decent scratch from a kid's bike in a parking lot.

# Myth 2: ""It's Maintenance Free""

**Reality:** I still wash my car bi-weekly, just much faster now.

# Myth 3: ""All Ceramic Coatings are the Same""

**Reality:** The difference between my professional coating and my DIY attempt was *significant*.

# Cost Analysis: Is It Really Worth It? üí∞

# Two-Year Cost Breakdown for M3:

|Expense|Before Coating|After Coating|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Professional Details|$200 x 8 = $1600|$100 x 4 = $400|
|Car Washes|$30 x 24 = $720|$15 x 24 = $360|
|Wax/Sealant|$80 x 4 = $320|$0|
|Initial Coating Cost|$0|$1800|
|**Total**|**$2640**|**$2560**|

*Plus the intangible value of time saved and maintained paint quality!*

# Real-World Performance: Arizona Climate Test üåµ

# Summer Performance (115¬∞F/46¬∞C):

* No visible oxidation
* Zero water spots despite hard water
* Minimal dust adherence

# Winter Performance (35¬∞F/2¬∞C):

* Excellent frost resistance
* No salt damage (during mountain trips)
* Maintained hydrophobic properties

# Tips from My Experience üìù

1. **Preparation is Everything**
   * *Never* skip paint correction
   * Take extra time for proper cleaning
   * Control your environment
2. **Maintenance Schedule**
   * Bi-weekly washes
   * Quarterly inspections
   * Annual deep cleaning
3. **What to Avoid**
   * Automatic car washes
   * Harsh chemicals
   * Extreme pressure washers

# The Verdict After Two Years üéØ

# Pros:

* **Time savings** are *significant*
* Paint looks better than new
* Minimal maintenance required
* Excellent protection
* Increased resale value

# Cons:

* High initial investment
* Professional application recommended
* Can highlight poor paint correction
* Not a miracle solution

# Conclusion

After two years and two very different cars, I'm completely sold on ceramic coating. Yes, it's an investment, but for anyone who cares about their car's appearance and protection, it's worth every penny.

‚ÄúCan I really do this? Do I deserve to be here?‚Äù These thoughts have been on a loop. I‚Äôm a newbie line cook at a newly opened restaurant at this 5 star hotel. It‚Äôs only been about a week since I started, but I‚Äôm already doubting myself.

They desperately needed staff, so I signed up, although I lack much experience (1 year in busy coffee shops, 3 months in a SLOW seafood boil kitchen). I‚Äôve failed a lot this week, but also learned a lot. The head chef has been nothing but kind and patient, openly encouraging me to ask all my questions, no matter how dumb or small. I am both grateful and guilty. 

There‚Äôs so much I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve never even truly been in the weeds. There are prepared culinary students that would kill to be in my spot (supposedly‚Äîwe need staff, so where are they?!), and yet I‚Äôm the guy they hired. 

Everyday I‚Äôm pushing myself to do better, go faster, work harder, but nothing feels like enough. (I admit self compassion is not a strong suit of mine.) I thought I was doing the mile and suddenly it‚Äôs a marathon. Tomorrow is a guaranteed busy Saturday, and I‚Äôm trying to muster up the courage and passion I thought I had an abundance of. Truth is, I‚Äôm terrified in anticipation of it.

TLDR: I‚Äôm a newbie line cook at a restaurant in a 5 star hotel struggling to keep up. Chefs, how do you do it? How was it like for you when you first started? What keeps you going? I need some motivation.

I'm doing a very prestigious internship at a place known for corruption. There are worse departments than mine, but mine has an incredibly high turnover rate and interns are basically treated like garbage. The majority of those who work here come from rich families or  go to Ivy League schools.

I come from a lower class family. My parents are dishwashers at fast food restaurants and make a combined $35,000 a year. Despite this, I worked really hard, went to college at 16 and got a graduate degree at 21. I worked multiple part-time and full-time jobs throughout college while staying on the honor roll and doing unpaid internships. I graduated in August and rejected multiple full-time jobs with decent salaries to do this internship that pays about $5 an hour.

Throughout my entire internship I've made it known that I want to move up and work here. I've wanted to work here since I started college and I'm working two other part-time jobs to support myself.

There was an opening in my department a few weeks ago and I made it very clear that I'd like to be considered. Throughout my internship I've taken on extra work to prepare me for this role and even took over the duties for this open position.

I found out on Tuesday that another intern got the position. This intern is notoriously known for being lazy and bad at her job. She comes in late everyday, gives most of her assignments to other interns, and takes off to go on vacation at least once a month. She refuses to do many basic intern tasks like make coffee or answer phones. She's constantly doing inappropriate things at work like paying other interns for back rubs and flirting with full time staff. However, her parents are friends with the boss.

I'm incredibly upset about this. My internship ends in three weeks and I have to worry about making rent and finding a new job while she doesn't have to worry about any of that. On top of this, I've been asked to train her on how to do some of the tasks for her new position.

She interned her before and was brought back to do another internship because she couldn't find a job. On her first day I asked her if she would like to work here and she said ""I'd take a job if one fell into my lap"".

The only solution I can think of is quiet quitting and refusing to train her. The only thing keeping me from quitting on the spot is the letter of recommendation I get when my internship ends.

On top of this no one has helped me look for jobs in different departments. Random people I networked with have been more helpful and willing to send me job openings than my coworkers.",74,1731720986.0,antiwork,12,0.94,False

1gscbw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusDrivers/comments/1gscbw3/fourth_day_on_the_job_nightmare/,Fourth day on the job nightmare,"First off, thank you guys for accepting me to this subreddit.

Today was my 4th day on the job, and it was a nightmare. I am currently sitting in a coffee shop waiting on a jumpstart from AAA because my car battery died after work. I was able to drive from the garage to the store to get my kid's meds, but it wouldn't start up again.

So, while I wait for AAA (it's going to be a bit because of accidents), I'll tell you how my fourth day went.

It snowed last night and all day today here in Alaska. I started my shift at 6 a.m., so the main roads were barely plowed, and the side roads were not even touched.

When I first started this job, I was told there would be 4 days of training before I was sent out on my own. I got two days of training and started solo yesterday. So my second day driving solo coincided with a winter storm.

I had three pick-ups I had to get before I started dropping people off. On the second pick up, I got stuck. I was assigned one of the rear wheel drive vans, and they are horrible in any kind of semi deep snow. It took me 45 minutes to unstuck it. Then I get to the end of the road and can't get enough traction to get back onto the main road. It didn't help that I had a car behind me that refused to move or go around even when I put my hazards on and waved out the window for them to ""go around!"" So I had two passengers in my vehicle (they were really great about all of this), and we're sitting there at a stop sign stuck for 5 more minutes. Finally, this car gets the idea to go around me. I then back up far enough that I can get enough momentum to propel the van out of the snow-covered dirt side road and back onto the main road.

But my rookie blunders didn't end there. I had a third pick-up. The side road wasn't plowed either, but I really didn't think it was a good idea to stop the van on the side of the highway on a curve even with hazards on. I already had two passengers on board. I called him, and he didn't seem inclined to walk. So I thought I could make it if I stuck to the tracks already in the snow. Nope. I got stuck, and I got stuck good. 

My trainer who trained me for two days and said I was good enough to go on my own had to be sent out to help me. He got the van unstuck only to spin it around and get it stuck even worse. Now, the back tire was in a ditch. The boss had to send another driver out to take my passengers and a tow truck to yank the van out of the ditch. 

Now I'm here waiting for my own car to be rescued cause the battery is dead. What a day.",3,1731720785.0,BusDrivers,1,1.0,False

1gsca1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1gsca1b/smilesville_part_1/,Smilesville (Part 1),"When I finally summoned the courage to leave my abusive husband, I was admitted into a shelter for battered women like myself. The people who ran the place were smart, and it was made to look like a thrift shop on the outside, with the shelter being behind the business surrounded by a tall fence. It was for people in really desperate situations, they took extreme measures to make sure no one's violent spouse could find the place, like confiscating our phones and only allowing us to use them if we were outside the immediate area. 

When I came there, they put me on a waiting list for a housing program that gives homes and new identities to abuse victims, homeless people, and occasionally people in need of witness protection. It was called the Brighter Days Agency, or something like that. Women left the shelter one by one, until finally it was my turn. I packed what little I had and got into a dark van with tinted windows, driven by a case worker named Mrs. Stratton assigned to me by the agency, and her coworker Mr. Hudson. 

I questioned why the windows were tinted, because it made it impossible to see the way there, and they simply smiled brightly and said it was to protect the identity of the passengers and also to prevent them from telling dangerous people the town's location. I figured this was a good enough reason and tried to enjoy the three hour long ride. When we got close, Mrs. Stratton turned down the windows and smiled at me. 

‚ÄúMiss Turner, we're here! Take a look.‚Äù 

My eyes eagerly observed the surroundings of the car, grateful to finally see outside. We were still driving, but when I stuck my head out, I could see we were approaching buildings up ahead. A sign proclaiming ‚ÄòWelcome to Smilesville‚Äô with a little text underneath that saying ‚Äòbrighter days start here! :)‚Äô (Yes, they had engraved a smiley face into it.) 

‚ÄúSmilesville?‚Äù I turned to them. 

Mr. Hudson nodded. ‚ÄúIt truly lives up to its name. You're gonna love it here, Cindy, trust me.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAre we still in Nevada?‚Äù I looked at the rolling hills and dense forest that surrounded the town before the tall buildings engulfed my view of the rural land.

Mrs. Stratton and Mr. Hudson chuckled in an almost condescending manner, but didn't answer my question. I decided to let it go, assuming the answer was yes. It seemed like a normal town, with shopping centers and busy streets full of regular people. Soon, we arrived at a suburban neighborhood named The Villa, where we parked at a leasing office. 

The receptionist took us on a tour and I signed some papers, and everything seemed normal, until they placed an NDA in front of me. 

‚ÄúYou cannot tell the outside world about this town under any circumstances.‚Äù Mrs. Stratton said, her smile seeming more forced than before. Mr. Hudson and the receptionist stared at me with similar expressions and I felt like an ant under a magnifying glass. 

‚ÄúYou'll find that social media is not allowed here.‚Äù Mr. Hudson added. ‚ÄúYou can use search engines and there are websites for educational purposes, but we've blocked all sorts of online forums to prevent word from getting out. I'm sure you understand.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSo, no Facebook or Instagram or anything?‚Äù I asked. 

‚ÄúPrecisely.‚Äù The receptionist nodded. ‚ÄúAlthough I'm sure you wouldn't want everyone and their mother knowing about your whereabouts anyways, considering everyone here has a‚Ä¶ dark history.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's no problem, at least my old high school friends can stop sending me invites to Farmville.‚Äù I joked, drawing a chuckle out of them. I truly didn't care. I was riddled with bruises and scars from the abuse that I suffered at the hands of my husband, Micheal. He's the son of the chief of police so it felt like he could truly get away with murder, and he was surrounded by a huge support system that would back him up, unlike me. I'd left several times but came crawling back because I had nothing and nobody without him. When I left for good, he promised me he'd find me and kill me. He was a stalker, and a damn good one at that, he had stalked me those other times I'd left until I found that secret women's shelter. He couldn't seem to find me there. 

Needless to say, I was beyond terrified of him and I didn't care what websites I couldn't use in order to stay in such a beautiful, and more importantly, safe place. After I signed the NDA, I was given a new name. No longer was I Cindy Turner, but Madison Gilmore, with a fake but official looking birth certificate and new government ID. I didn't know that was legal, but what did I care? I was free. 

‚ÄúOne last thing.‚Äù Mrs. Stratton held my house keys at bay as we stood in front of my new residence, her face becoming serious once more. ‚ÄúBe sure to always wear a smile when you leave the house. You're never properly dressed without it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat's the most important law in Smilesville.‚Äù Mrs. Stratton's smile strained. ‚ÄúYou can do whatever you like within the confines of your new home, but outside of it, you absolutely must smile at all times and show as little negative displays of emotion as humanly possible. If you don't, I can't guarantee your stay here will be very long.‚Äù 

I frowned, thinking this was ridiculous. Forcing victims of abuse to act fake happy all the time was sickening to me, and I was known as a bit of a grouch by everyone else in the shelter. ‚ÄúThis is all wonderful, but isn't it a bit much to threaten to make me homeless again if I don't act happy go lucky?‚Äù 

‚ÄúCin-*I mean,* Madison, that is a *very* small price to pay for everything we've given you.‚Äù Mrs. Stratton lectured me, making me feel like an ungrateful brat. ‚ÄúAnd it's for your own good. Everyone else can handle it. Can you?‚Äù 

I nodded and she gave me the house keys. ‚ÄúLet's practice. Give me a big smile right now. Come on, I know you have it in you!‚Äù 

I smiled for her, intentionally fake and cheesy on purpose, but she seemed to glow with satisfaction. ‚ÄúWhat a beautiful smile, Miss Gilmore. Please remember to show it to everyone everywhere you go no matter what happens or what anyone says. Have a wonderful life.‚Äù With that, she left. 

The home I was given was beautiful, a single family two storey house with eggshell white walls and modern, minimalist decor. It was already furnished, and I was given a voucher for new clothes and a grocery budget for the month until I could secure a job. It felt like heaven, truly, and they'd already transported my car here before I myself even arrived. I found my vehicle in the garage and drove to the shops in town. That's when I noticed that things were off. 

First off, I visited some clothing boutiques. My clothes were worn and cheap, with holes and tears. Micheal didn't like me having nice things because in his opinion that was telling all the men in public that I was available. It took me a few minutes to realize, but the staff that greeted and assisted me weren't the only ones with giant, bubbly smiles plastered over their faces. The customers wore big grins, too, no matter what they were doing. A tired looking mother bounced her crying baby up and down while smiling big enough to show her teeth, although it clearly didn't reach her weary eyes. 

A different mother, this one with a toddler, was smiling for absolutely no reason as she thumbed through shirts hanging on a rack. It then hit me that her child was wearing a mask, one that was made to look like a regular smiling human's face with rosy cheeks and a realistic nose. Her bright blue eyes stared at me through the holes in the mask. 

‚ÄúHello!‚Äù Her mother greeted me, as she must've noticed I was staring. 

‚ÄúHi!‚Äù I smiled back at her. ‚ÄúI'm new here. What a cute mask your kid has‚Ä¶‚Äù I was lying of course, the mask was creepy, but I wanted to bring it up somehow. 

‚ÄúOh yes, well, she was kicking up a fuss this morning so I had to break out the smiling mask.‚Äù The mother laughed. She noticed my confused look. ‚ÄúAnytime you find smiling a bit harder than usual, there are Smile shops with masks so you don't get flagged down.‚Äù 

‚Äú....Flagged down?‚Äù

‚ÄúBy the officers, the Smile Sentinels.‚Äù The woman replied, her smile twitching. ‚ÄúDidn't they brief you on all this? You must smile, it's the number one rule, if you don't, you could get in big trouble! So smile!‚Äù She put her fingers in the corners of her mouth and stretched them, making me realize I wasn't smiling and correcting myself. 

Feeling nervous about my new home, I smiled throughout my entire transaction in that store, and then gave the muscles in my face a break once I was walking to my car in the parking lot. I wondered what exactly was up with this town as I looked around at passersby and noticed how joyful they appeared, like they'd just won the lottery. Even a homeless man sitting on a bench nearby had a gleeful demeanor. It was pretty uncomfortable, to be honest, but ultimately harmless. 

I went to the grocery store next. Everyone inside and outside the building was eerily smiling as well, their eyes perpetually squinted in mirth and their voices cartoonishly chipper. I just remember walking around with my cart and observing how happy everyone seemed. That's when I noticed them. 

The entire time I'd been out, I‚Äôd seen men and women in uniform here and there, people I assumed to be police officers because of their dark official looking outfits with batons and walkie talkies attached at their hip. I saw one, a man, up close, and he was pale with bags under his dark, gloomy eyes and a big grin on his face. He was stationed in a corner by the produce and his eyes had been fixed on me for a very long time. Upon looking him over, I realized he didn't have a police badge, but rather a different kind of badge I didn't recognize. Remember the little girl's mask? It was made to look like that, like he had a mini porcelain mask clipped to his chest, framed with ornate gold. 

I glared at him, feeling intensely uncomfortable at how long he was staring at me. No sooner than my eyes narrowed and my brows furrowed, I saw his smile twitch as he uncrossed his arms and strode over to stand in front of me. 

‚ÄúGood afternoon, ma'am!‚Äù His voice was deep and he sounded like a child on Christmas morning. ‚ÄúIsn't it a beautiful day today?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI guess.‚Äù I remember replying. 

‚ÄúI couldn't help but notice you left the house in an improper state.‚Äù He continued, earning a confused look from me which then made him elaborate. ‚ÄúYou seem to have put on your smile upside down, ma'am. Do I have to fix that for you?‚Äù 

I tensed, feeling that there was a subtle threat in his forcefully happy voice. Instead of snapping at him like I wanted to, my eyes looked down to his baton, and what looked like some kind of featureless bottle of mace I didn't notice before, and I decided to simply flash a tight, temporary smile at him before pushing my cart along. 

But the man, a Smile Sentinel I assumed, followed me and tapped my shoulder. I faced him with frustration and his smile seemed even more strained. ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam‚Ä¶ are you going to be a problem?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat am I doing that's so bad?‚Äù I let loose on him, ignoring the awkward stares other passing shoppers gave us (while still maintaining their smiles). ‚ÄúI can't possibly smile every second of the day, that's inhuman!‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt sounds like you're going to be a problem.‚Äù His voice took a dive from cheerful to a weird mix of that and threatening, a borderline sadistic tone, even. He removed his baton and I felt a rush of fear. ‚ÄúIt sounds like you're becoming hysterical and disrupting this happy environment. Will I have to discipline you?‚Äù 

Before I could say anything, a familiar face intervened. Sandra, a woman from the shelter I had befriended who'd left for this place half a year ago, stepped between us with a beaming expression. ‚ÄúSorry, my friend here is just new. She has no problem being happy, officer. Right?‚Äù 

She turned to me and her eyes widened in a way that suggested if I knew what was good for me I'd play along. I vigorously nodded and forced my lips to curl upward, showing the Smile Sentinel my bad teeth which my husband had disfigured. The officer backed up and put away his baton, nodding in satisfaction. ‚ÄúOh, that's good, then. I was worried we had a problem on our hands. Have a wonderful life, ladies.‚Äù 

I watched as he returned to his position, then Sandra gestured for me to follow her before pushing her cart into an aisle where we were out of his sight. 

‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù I whispered to her.  

‚ÄúGirl, didn't they tell you anything when you came here?‚Äù Sandra looked at me like I was crazy. I took this moment to give her a once over.  I remember her always looking haggard and ten years older than her actual age, but now she looked like a sight for sore eyes, with a new hairdo, professionally applied makeup, and nice clothes.

Sandra had a similar story to me, she had left her abusive husband who had apparently had ties with the local street gang in our hometown, and she was absolutely certain that he and his demented friends would gun her down in a drive-by shooting if they saw her out in public.  He had threatened her with this countless times, and she even discreetly confessed to me that he'd told her he killed other people who crossed him the same way and was never found out. She was a middle aged woman with three kids that were in foster care until she could secure herself a house, kids who were presumably at home at that moment. 

‚ÄúWhat is this place?‚Äù I asked her. 

‚ÄúLet's not talk here‚Ä¶ Let's meet at my place.‚Äù 

I followed her to her home in my car, and coincidentally, she lived in my neighborhood maybe a few blocks down. Her three kids were running about playing as we sat and talked in the dining room. 

Sandra explained to me that this town was absolutely perfect, until it came down to the weird smile rule they had. No matter what was going on in your life, if you weren't smiling every second of your time in public, you would be taken into custody, and horrendous things happened to those that were carried away by the Smile Sentinels. She didn't even want to go into detail about it, but she did say that repeat offenders would either disappear or become a Smile Sentinel with a completely reworked personality, as if they'd been brainwashed. 

‚ÄúThings will go well for you if you just do what they say.‚Äù Sandra assured me. ‚ÄúThere's great schools and plenty of jobs here.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBut what happens to the people that disappear, do they get kicked out of town?‚Äù I wanted to know. 

Sandra opened her mouth then closed it, looking away from me in tense silence. She slowly shook her head. ‚ÄúLook‚Ä¶ I think it's best if you don't get too curious, okay?‚Äù 

‚ÄúSandra, what happens to those people?‚Äù I pressed. 

‚ÄúMy name isn't Sandra anymore, it's Diane!‚Äù She snapped. 

‚ÄúI saw this kid who was wearing a mask, and her mother said they put masks on kids who have a hard time with the smiling thing.‚Äù I said, shuddering. ‚ÄúHave your kids ever had to do that?‚Äù

‚Äú...Yes.‚Äù She admitted. ‚ÄúAisha had hurt her knee pretty badly playing outside, so she burst into tears. We were at the park and I hadn't brought my car so I tried to run and carry her back. An officer was patrolling in his car and stopped us, and I begged him to just let me get her home, but‚Ä¶ but he‚Ä¶ he‚Ä¶‚Äù Her eyes watered.

‚ÄúHe what?‚Äù I leaned in, growing concerned. My gaze flicked over to where Aisha, a six year old girl, was sitting with her back to us watching television, more still and silent than a girl her age should be. She was watching a cartoon show where the main characters were in a hospital, and she seemed completely enraptured by it.

‚ÄúHe told me her crying was obscene and I should've had a mask with us to hide her face.‚Äù Sandra continued, choked up. ‚ÄúThen he got out the car and grabbed her, and his- his partner held me back while he- he took something off his belt‚Ä¶ I thought it was mace at first but it wasn't, it was‚Ä¶‚Äù 

*‚ÄúTime for your shot!‚Äù* One of the cartoon characters' bubbly voices cut through our conversation. *‚ÄúThis will only hurt a bit!‚Äù*

Suddenly, Aisha threw her head back and exploded into hysterics. Her keening laughter bounced over the walls and scared the absolute shit out of me. She was laughing so hard the sound was almost aggressive or violent, as weird as that sounds. Tears started running down her face, and her eyes rolled into the back of her head, showing those little red veins. Vomit started to build up in her throat, dribbling down her chin and splashing over her shirt. She gurgled it as she continued laughing through her puking, and it splattered onto the carpet and filled the air with a sour smell. 

The sight was enough to make me want to run out the door, it was incredibly frightening and so abrupt. She looked possessed in every sense of the word. Her siblings stared at her while hugging each other in fear, and Sandra got up and ran to her. 

‚ÄúWhat's wrong with her?!‚Äù I asked, standing up from the table. ‚ÄúShould I call-?‚Äù 

‚ÄúDon't call anyone!‚Äù Sandra yelled back, picking up Aisha and holding her close, letting her vomit get all over her. She started to carry the girl upstairs. ‚ÄúAubrey, turn that shit off! She can't watch this show anymore! She can't watch anything to do with needles!‚Äù 

‚ÄúNeedles‚Ä¶?‚Äù I went over to the bottom of the stairs and watched them go up, desperate for answers. ‚ÄúDid he‚Ä¶inject her with something?‚Äù 

Aisha looked over her mother's shoulder down at me as Sandra got to the top step, her eyes were unseeing and she cackled ceaselessly as vomit and saliva poured down her bottom lip in rivulets. She looked utterly insane, but I don't remember Sandra ever saying anything was wrong with her mentally. 

Sandra shot a glare at me and said, ‚ÄúYou should go home, we'll catch up later,‚Äù then disappeared down the hall. 

Utterly flabbergasted, I left the house and drove to my own place. I replayed the events in my head as I put away my groceries and my new wardrobe. What did they inject that poor little girl with that would give her such horrible PTSD, and how could someone in a position of authority just do that? You're telling me these people can just hurt us whatever way they want with no repercussions? All for being upset in public? 

I felt uneasy that night as I microwaved myself a TV dinner and channel surfed in the living room. Cable and WiFi had already been installed for me, conveniently enough. After I ate that processed junk, I went through my phone to verify what they'd said to me earlier, and indeed, 99% of the websites I usually visited were blocked, presumably by my Wi-Fi network, and by the service they gave me for phone data too. Sandra had said everyone in town used the same provider. Maybe it was like this not to protect us, but to hide what they were doing here to people. Still, I had nowhere else to go and I had been looking forward to this for a long time. Maybe I could stay here until I saved up enough to move elsewhere, to another state even? 

I was just about to call it a night when I heard a commotion outside. I paused the TV and listened. Someone was sobbing and wailing, loud enough to wake the whole street, so I rushed to my front step to see what was going on. 

A couple of houses down, a woman was in hysterics, following a few paradamics as they wheeled someone covered in a white blanket on a stretcher to the ambulance. She eventually collapsed onto her yard sobbing as they put the body in the back of the vehicle. What seemed to be her husband ran to her in a panic and tried to force her up so he could get her back in the house. He was yelling at her. The sight triggered me a little, reminding me of how violently my husband handled me even during my worst moments. 

All the neighbors that were outside immediately retreated into the house, which I thought was odd. Usually people loved to be nosy, and would form a crowd to watch scenes like that. Instead, they were ushering their kids inside and hurrying to slam their doors and shut their blinds. The air was rife with a high tension that made a chill run down my spine, but still, I continued to watch on my doorstep, considering offering help. 

Then I heard a siren. It wasn't a police siren, it honestly reminded me of a fire alarm or a tornado siren. A bright yellow car with flashing neon yellow lights affixed to the roof careened down the street. Smile Sentinels charged out of the vehicle and apprehended the grieving woman. I watched in horror as the husband tried to fight them and got beaten within an inch of his life by their batons. The woman was restrained by two of the officers while a third produced the small canister from their belt. The answers I was seeking became clear to me as it looked like they stabbed something in the side of the woman's face, administering a shot. 

Almost immediately, she started to laugh like a mad woman and fall all over herself in the yard, reminding me of the frantic and discombobulated movements of a rabid animal going nuts. She couldn't seem to walk straight, and she stumbled from side to side and scrambled over the ground as if she were inebriated on all sorts of hard substances, unconcerned with the fact her husband lay unconscious a few feet away in a bloody heap. It was like watching a train wreck, I couldn't tear my eyes away.  

That is, until one of the Smile Sentinels looked my way and I instinctively stepped back inside the house and slammed and locked the door. What the hell did I get myself into? Why would they send depressed victims of abuse such as myself into a place where they could be abused even more? Was protection from my husband worth all this? 

Then I remembered just how terrified that man had me in my own house everyday and decided that I would ignore it all and play along. I know it sounds crazy but...With my husband, there was no chance of safety whatsoever, but here, all I had to do to be safe was smile. I couldn't go back to living in that shelter, let alone living in cheap motels. I just couldn't. 

So I assimilated into this strange private society, making sure I smiled whenever I left my home, and I focused on trying to rebuild my life after my complete mess of a marriage. I met with Sandra more often (I will be referring to her by her old name to avoid confusion) and I found a mundane but remote customer representative job, so I didn't have to leave the house as much. But things became hard to ignore one day when I was out running errands. 

I was driving back home, sipping a to-go cup of coffee, when traffic was held up by a protest. A crowd of people, some wearing custom made frowning masks and some just scowling or crying, filled the street with picket signs protesting the smile law. Those yellow cruisers entered the scene not long after and a legion of Smile Sentinels attacked the protestors, beating and arresting them and loading them into the backs of their cars. This greatly disturbed me, seeing the bruised and bloody faces of those protestors and the blood stains they left on the road. 

Back at home, I watched the local news where the newswoman was grimly informing the public about a rebellion in Smilesville. The rebellion was called the Scowlers, and anyone that was considered to be a part of them would be taken into custody immediately. That's not the bad part, though. What disturbed me was that the Council that ran that small town in place of a mayor, was putting in extremist measures to snuff out the rebellion. Everyone was to wear a smile mask when leaving the house to show their loyalty, that was a new law that would be put in place within the next week. The worst part was that everyone would be required to medicate daily with a less strong version of what they called the Smile Shot, which is what the Sentinels have been using against ‚Äúhysterical‚Äù citizens. The same shit that made that little girl and that woman go ballistic. 

This terrified me and I thought surely they weren't serious. But they were, *Jesus Christ* they *were.* 

Within the next seven days, they introduced this bizarre new lifestyle to everyone in town. Every Monday, every single household would be delivered a package with enough doses of the Smile serum to last a week along with alcohol pads and clean needles. Every tenant in the household had to be medicated daily, including children. Infants were spared of course, but they always had to remain at home, or be given special medication they released specifically for the purpose of 'safely' keeping the baby asleep so as not to cause disturbances. They wouldn't tell people what was in it. The bottle of pills was white with no label of ingredients.

All schools and workplaces opened an hour earlier so you could be tested for the serum, and if it wasn't found in your bloodstream (or there wasn't enough in your bloodstream) you would be administered it right then and there, and that would be a strike. If you got to strike 3, then the Smile Sentinels would be called on you, and good God they got more brutal each time.

This town was insane. As far as I could tell, there was absolutely no normal police department, just an equivalent  for Sentinels (the ‚ÄòSentinel Stations‚Äô) where you could file a report against someone for not smiling as crazy as that sounds, and virtually no real crime other than the ones perpetuated against the smile law and petty thievery or vandalism now and again. It seemed that the Sentinels also served as police, but thieves and vandals would either not be heard from again or brainwashed into a Sentinel rather than being jailed. It was like they were trying so hard to make the perfect place, but it was a dystopian nightmare. 

Since I worked from home, I did not have to be tested daily, so I thought I could get away with not injecting the serum into myself. After all, they didn't tell anyone what was in it, and what if I had a bad reaction to that sickly, vibrant yellow fluid? However, I didn't get away with this, not at all. 

At the end of the first week, I was cooking myself breakfast when I got a knock on the door. The sight I got in the peephole was nothing short of terrifying, there was a prim and proper looking woman standing outside with two male Smile Sentinels behind her. All three of them were wearing these flesh colored, shiny masks with big plastic grins and rosy cheeks, and one of the officers had the handle of a sleek white medical case in his hand. 

I opened the door and the woman raised a pen to the clipboard she was holding and went, ‚ÄúHello, I assume you're Miss Madison Gilmore. I'm an assistant of the Council here to perform your weekly Smile Serum test.‚Äù 

Dumbfounded, I stared at them and their masks of realistic human faces for a few seconds. ‚Äú... What?‚Äù 

‚ÄúIf you could step aside so we can enter, that would be most appreciated!‚Äù The woman chirped. 

‚ÄúI-I‚Äôm busy-‚Äù I stammered, scrambling to find an excuse. 

‚ÄúMa'am,‚Äù the overly joyful voice of one of the Sentinels interrupted me, ‚Äúif you don't step aside we will have to use force. Let's all be happy and compliant today instead!‚Äù 

They forced their way inside, their broad shoulders shoving my underweight frame out of the way easily. The woman strode into the living room after the Sentinels with a pep in her step, ‚ÄúDon't worry, I am a trained nurse and this will not take long!‚Äù 

I sat down nervously as they opened the case and produced a needle. She drew my blood, put it in a tube, gave it to one of the Sentinels, and he left for the van they had parked outside. ‚ÄúHe's just running a quick test.‚Äù The woman said. 

It took maybe around twenty to thirty minutes, with the woman chatting my ear off to pass the time. I was drowning in anxiety and gave her short, blunt answers, before finally the Sentinel returned with a slip of paper in hand. He eyed me through the holes in his eerie mask as he handed the test results to the woman. 

‚ÄúOh dear!‚Äù The woman exclaimed melodramatically. ‚ÄúIt seems that your test came back negative! You haven't been taking your injections, have you?!‚Äù 

‚ÄúPlease, I can explain‚Ä¶‚Äù I nervously looked up at the Sentinels who stared down at me with their hands clasped behind their backs. 

‚ÄúLucky for you, I can give you a dosage.‚Äù She produced a needle loaded with neon yellow fluid from the white case. I stood up frantically, and the Sentinels forced me back down in my seat, holding one of my arms out for the woman to tie a band around my flesh in order for a vein to become visible. ‚ÄúThankfully, this version of the serum can be administered to areas other than the face. This will only hurt a bit.‚Äù 

Oh, how to describe that experience? It felt like they had injected lava into my veins, and my body temperature skyrocketed. My brain began to buzz, I can't even begin to describe that sensation so that's the closest I can get to telling you. I began to have muscle spasms and my limbs twitched and jerked. My eyes watered and tears fell. Suddenly, I cracked a smirk, then a smile, then a full on grin. I felt like a puppet, I couldn't control how the muscles in my face contorted. Every time I tried to force my lips to a flat line, it felt like trying to hold back an inevitable sneeze, or trying to bend an appendage in a way it wasn't meant to be bent, and I failed. It was God awful and I'd sooner shoot myself than endure it again. 

‚ÄúThere we are.‚Äù She said with satisfaction. ‚ÄúI'm afraid I'll have to give you a strike, however, for your inability to follow our rules. Don't fret though, you still have two more until we have to crack the whip on you.‚Äù 

Then, they promptly left, and I was left a shaking mess, not because I was scared, that was yet another symptom. The symptoms weren't all just physical though, it was also mental anguish. For the rest of the day, every time I felt even remotely negative, like for example remembering the cruel words my husband hurled at me or thinking about how I wish I could have a glow up like Sandra's because of how ugly I felt; the serum would punish me. I would feel a shock shoot through me, like static electricity when you run your feet on the carpet and touch metal. *Especially* when I would feel fear thinking about what was happening in this town, the effects tripled. Then I would suffer a God awful migraine and a feeling of euphoric high, which made me feel like I was tripping on acid more than truly happy. 

During this high, I would burst into a fit of uncontrollable laughter that would go on for so long I almost suffocated, my sides and my face aching horrendously. It was like being tickled to the point of torture, with the person tickling you not letting up even though you couldn't breathe and tears were running down your face and you were about to vomit. And vomit, I certainly did. A lot. I grew tired of the acidic taste of bile in my throat, and my brain felt like it was chock full of a swarm of bees, but I couldn't make any of it stop. As the hours ticked by, it got slightly better to deal with, but just the thought of doing this everyday terrified me‚Ä¶

Running errands in town became more interesting of an experience, as everyone else was also suffering the symptoms of the Smile Serum. I couldn't seem to get used to people around me bursting into fits of cackles without warning, for seemingly no reason whatsoever, and I jumped out of my skin every time. Smilesville seemed to turn into a town of ‚Äòsmile junkies,‚Äô as the rebels called us, tripping off a high no one's seen before, rivaling the unpredictable behavior of methheads and crackheads. When getting lunch, I saw a table full of bereaved individuals wearing black who clearly just returned from a funeral procession, but they grinned like the Cheshire cat and howled with mad laughter like the Joker as endless tears poured down from their torment-filled eyes.

I vented about all this when I had a coffee with Sandra next, at her house of course, and she shared my sentiments. Her kids hated shots and made that very clear with tantrums, same as the other elementary schoolers, but over time the injections warped the way they behaved. She cried to me, wishing she had her children back the way they were. She said it felt like they were in what she called ‚Äòla la land' all the time, like they weren't ‚Äòall there‚Äô if you catch my drift, and I felt for her. 

‚ÄúI'm starting to think maybe those ‚ÄòScowlers‚Äô or whatever they were called were right.‚Äù Sandra sighed, running her hand through her hair and watching as Aubrey, her eldest, giggled and mindlessly ran around the kitchen in circles for no particular reason. ‚ÄúIt's not worth all this.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I agreed hesitantly. I was lying, actually. Even though this all felt hellish, the abuse of my husband lingered in the back of my mind, and the loneliness I had felt, too. Even though it was like Crazy Town, I could feel somewhat a sense of community in Smilesville. Even though those smiles and kind gestures were forced, it was better than the dark reality back home, where my peers coldly ignored my swollen eye and bloody nose, and strangers didn't spare me a sideways glance. 

But I soon would realize just how awful things were in Smilesville, as the situation escalated beyond control. 

People were being outed as Scowlers more and more, anonymous tips being made and sending Sentinels barging through their doors. They were not seen again. Sandra told me that there were spies for the Council hidden everywhere, they were simply normal townspeople secretly given the responsibility of finding members of the Scowlers and pretending to want to join their ranks in order to bust them. You didn't even have to participate in protests to be a Scowler, you just had to refuse to take the serum. As much as I hated the injections, I knew it had to be done, but Sandra told me a way to get away with taking less was injecting it every two days rather than daily. It was still harrowing for my mind and body but I found that I coped better. 

I thought about it long and hard, and I finally contacted my case worker and asked her to meet with me at my house. Mrs. Stratton arrived with an ugly smile mask and sat across from me at my dining room table. ‚ÄúSo what is it you would like to discuss, Miss Gilmore?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI want to move.‚Äù I explained, a painful smile stuck on my tear-soaked face. ‚ÄúI want to leave this program, and find somewhere else to live. It's just not worth the suffering.‚Äù 

Mrs. Stratton stared at me through her mask for a few painfully silent moments, then sighed. ‚ÄúOkay, hon. Let me gather the paperwork and get back to you on that.‚Äù 

This instilled me with hope and I hugged her before she left. I was so ecstatic to be leaving that I started packing some of my things straight away that night. At this point I had lived here for a few months, while enduring this smile serum nonsense for one whole month, and I was fully prepared to get on the road and never look back even if it meant I'd be without a home for a while. 

Oh God, if only I'd known what chaos would transpire next, I would've packed everything and left that very night.

1gsc8ib,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gsc8ib/smilesville_part_1/,Smilesville (Part 1),"When I finally summoned the courage to leave my abusive husband, I was admitted into a shelter for battered women like myself. The people who ran the place were smart, and it was made to look like a thrift shop on the outside, with the shelter being behind the business surrounded by a tall fence. It was for people in really desperate situations, they took extreme measures to make sure no one's violent spouse could find the place, like confiscating our phones and only allowing us to use them if we were outside the immediate area. 

When I came there, they put me on a waiting list for a housing program that gives homes and new identities to abuse victims, homeless people, and occasionally people in need of witness protection. It was called the Brighter Days Agency, or something like that. Women left the shelter one by one, until finally it was my turn. I packed what little I had and got into a dark van with tinted windows, driven by a case worker named Mrs. Stratton assigned to me by the agency, and her coworker Mr. Hudson. 

I questioned why the windows were tinted, because it made it impossible to see the way there, and they simply smiled brightly and said it was to protect the identity of the passengers and also to prevent them from telling dangerous people the town's location. I figured this was a good enough reason and tried to enjoy the three hour long ride. When we got close, Mrs. Stratton turned down the windows and smiled at me. 

‚ÄúMiss Turner, we're here! Take a look.‚Äù 

My eyes eagerly observed the surroundings of the car, grateful to finally see outside. We were still driving, but when I stuck my head out, I could see we were approaching buildings up ahead. A sign proclaiming ‚ÄòWelcome to Smilesville‚Äô with a little text underneath that saying ‚Äòbrighter days start here! :)‚Äô (Yes, they had engraved a smiley face into it.) 

‚ÄúSmilesville?‚Äù I turned to them. 

Mr. Hudson nodded. ‚ÄúIt truly lives up to its name. You're gonna love it here, Cindy, trust me.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAre we still in Nevada?‚Äù I looked at the rolling hills and dense forest that surrounded the town before the tall buildings engulfed my view of the rural land.

Mrs. Stratton and Mr. Hudson chuckled in an almost condescending manner, but didn't answer my question. I decided to let it go, assuming the answer was yes. It seemed like a normal town, with shopping centers and busy streets full of regular people. Soon, we arrived at a suburban neighborhood named The Villa, where we parked at a leasing office. 

The receptionist took us on a tour and I signed some papers, and everything seemed normal, until they placed an NDA in front of me. 

‚ÄúYou cannot tell the outside world about this town under any circumstances.‚Äù Mrs. Stratton said, her smile seeming more forced than before. Mr. Hudson and the receptionist stared at me with similar expressions and I felt like an ant under a magnifying glass. 

‚ÄúYou'll find that social media is not allowed here.‚Äù Mr. Hudson added. ‚ÄúYou can use search engines and there are websites for educational purposes, but we've blocked all sorts of online forums to prevent word from getting out. I'm sure you understand.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSo, no Facebook or Instagram or anything?‚Äù I asked. 

‚ÄúPrecisely.‚Äù The receptionist nodded. ‚ÄúAlthough I'm sure you wouldn't want everyone and their mother knowing about your whereabouts anyways, considering everyone here has a‚Ä¶ dark history.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's no problem, at least my old high school friends can stop sending me invites to Farmville.‚Äù I joked, drawing a chuckle out of them. I truly didn't care. I was riddled with bruises and scars from the abuse that I suffered at the hands of my husband, Micheal. He's the son of the chief of police so it felt like he could truly get away with murder, and he was surrounded by a huge support system that would back him up, unlike me. I'd left several times but came crawling back because I had nothing and nobody without him. When I left for good, he promised me he'd find me and kill me. He was a stalker, and a damn good one at that, he had stalked me those other times I'd left until I found that secret women's shelter. He couldn't seem to find me there. 

Needless to say, I was beyond terrified of him and I didn't care what websites I couldn't use in order to stay in such a beautiful, and more importantly, safe place. After I signed the NDA, I was given a new name. No longer was I Cindy Turner, but Madison Gilmore, with a fake but official looking birth certificate and new government ID. I didn't know that was legal, but what did I care? I was free. 

‚ÄúOne last thing.‚Äù Mrs. Stratton held my house keys at bay as we stood in front of my new residence, her face becoming serious once more. ‚ÄúBe sure to always wear a smile when you leave the house. You're never properly dressed without it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat's the most important law in Smilesville.‚Äù Mrs. Stratton's smile strained. ‚ÄúYou can do whatever you like within the confines of your new home, but outside of it, you absolutely must smile at all times and show as little negative displays of emotion as humanly possible. If you don't, I can't guarantee your stay here will be very long.‚Äù 

I frowned, thinking this was ridiculous. Forcing victims of abuse to act fake happy all the time was sickening to me, and I was known as a bit of a grouch by everyone else in the shelter. ‚ÄúThis is all wonderful, but isn't it a bit much to threaten to make me homeless again if I don't act happy go lucky?‚Äù 

‚ÄúCin-*I mean,* Madison, that is a *very* small price to pay for everything we've given you.‚Äù Mrs. Stratton lectured me, making me feel like an ungrateful brat. ‚ÄúAnd it's for your own good. Everyone else can handle it. Can you?‚Äù 

I nodded and she gave me the house keys. ‚ÄúLet's practice. Give me a big smile right now. Come on, I know you have it in you!‚Äù 

I smiled for her, intentionally fake and cheesy on purpose, but she seemed to glow with satisfaction. ‚ÄúWhat a beautiful smile, Miss Gilmore. Please remember to show it to everyone everywhere you go no matter what happens or what anyone says. Have a wonderful life.‚Äù With that, she left. 

The home I was given was beautiful, a single family two storey house with eggshell white walls and modern, minimalist decor. It was already furnished, and I was given a voucher for new clothes and a grocery budget for the month until I could secure a job. It felt like heaven, truly, and they'd already transported my car here before I myself even arrived. I found my vehicle in the garage and drove to the shops in town. That's when I noticed that things were off. 

First off, I visited some clothing boutiques. My clothes were worn and cheap, with holes and tears. Micheal didn't like me having nice things because in his opinion that was telling all the men in public that I was available. It took me a few minutes to realize, but the staff that greeted and assisted me weren't the only ones with giant, bubbly smiles plastered over their faces. The customers wore big grins, too, no matter what they were doing. A tired looking mother bounced her crying baby up and down while smiling big enough to show her teeth, although it clearly didn't reach her weary eyes. 

A different mother, this one with a toddler, was smiling for absolutely no reason as she thumbed through shirts hanging on a rack. It then hit me that her child was wearing a mask, one that was made to look like a regular smiling human's face with rosy cheeks and a realistic nose. Her bright blue eyes stared at me through the holes in the mask. 

‚ÄúHello!‚Äù Her mother greeted me, as she must've noticed I was staring. 

‚ÄúHi!‚Äù I smiled back at her. ‚ÄúI'm new here. What a cute mask your kid has‚Ä¶‚Äù I was lying of course, the mask was creepy, but I wanted to bring it up somehow. 

‚ÄúOh yes, well, she was kicking up a fuss this morning so I had to break out the smiling mask.‚Äù The mother laughed. She noticed my confused look. ‚ÄúAnytime you find smiling a bit harder than usual, there are Smile shops with masks so you don't get flagged down.‚Äù 

‚Äú....Flagged down?‚Äù

‚ÄúBy the officers, the Smile Sentinels.‚Äù The woman replied, her smile twitching. ‚ÄúDidn't they brief you on all this? You must smile, it's the number one rule, if you don't, you could get in big trouble! So smile!‚Äù She put her fingers in the corners of her mouth and stretched them, making me realize I wasn't smiling and correcting myself. 

Feeling nervous about my new home, I smiled throughout my entire transaction in that store, and then gave the muscles in my face a break once I was walking to my car in the parking lot. I wondered what exactly was up with this town as I looked around at passersby and noticed how joyful they appeared, like they'd just won the lottery. Even a homeless man sitting on a bench nearby had a gleeful demeanor. It was pretty uncomfortable, to be honest, but ultimately harmless. 

I went to the grocery store next. Everyone inside and outside the building was eerily smiling as well, their eyes perpetually squinted in mirth and their voices cartoonishly chipper. I just remember walking around with my cart and observing how happy everyone seemed. That's when I noticed them. 

The entire time I'd been out, I‚Äôd seen men and women in uniform here and there, people I assumed to be police officers because of their dark official looking outfits with batons and walkie talkies attached at their hip. I saw one, a man, up close, and he was pale with bags under his dark, gloomy eyes and a big grin on his face. He was stationed in a corner by the produce and his eyes had been fixed on me for a very long time. Upon looking him over, I realized he didn't have a police badge, but rather a different kind of badge I didn't recognize. Remember the little girl's mask? It was made to look like that, like he had a mini porcelain mask clipped to his chest, framed with ornate gold. 

I glared at him, feeling intensely uncomfortable at how long he was staring at me. No sooner than my eyes narrowed and my brows furrowed, I saw his smile twitch as he uncrossed his arms and strode over to stand in front of me. 

‚ÄúGood afternoon, ma'am!‚Äù His voice was deep and he sounded like a child on Christmas morning. ‚ÄúIsn't it a beautiful day today?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI guess.‚Äù I remember replying. 

‚ÄúI couldn't help but notice you left the house in an improper state.‚Äù He continued, earning a confused look from me which then made him elaborate. ‚ÄúYou seem to have put on your smile upside down, ma'am. Do I have to fix that for you?‚Äù 

I tensed, feeling that there was a subtle threat in his forcefully happy voice. Instead of snapping at him like I wanted to, my eyes looked down to his baton, and what looked like some kind of featureless bottle of mace I didn't notice before, and I decided to simply flash a tight, temporary smile at him before pushing my cart along. 

But the man, a Smile Sentinel I assumed, followed me and tapped my shoulder. I faced him with frustration and his smile seemed even more strained. ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam‚Ä¶ are you going to be a problem?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat am I doing that's so bad?‚Äù I let loose on him, ignoring the awkward stares other passing shoppers gave us (while still maintaining their smiles). ‚ÄúI can't possibly smile every second of the day, that's inhuman!‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt sounds like you're going to be a problem.‚Äù His voice took a dive from cheerful to a weird mix of that and threatening, a borderline sadistic tone, even. He removed his baton and I felt a rush of fear. ‚ÄúIt sounds like you're becoming hysterical and disrupting this happy environment. Will I have to discipline you?‚Äù 

Before I could say anything, a familiar face intervened. Sandra, a woman from the shelter I had befriended who'd left for this place half a year ago, stepped between us with a beaming expression. ‚ÄúSorry, my friend here is just new. She has no problem being happy, officer. Right?‚Äù 

She turned to me and her eyes widened in a way that suggested if I knew what was good for me I'd play along. I vigorously nodded and forced my lips to curl upward, showing the Smile Sentinel my bad teeth which my husband had disfigured. The officer backed up and put away his baton, nodding in satisfaction. ‚ÄúOh, that's good, then. I was worried we had a problem on our hands. Have a wonderful life, ladies.‚Äù 

I watched as he returned to his position, then Sandra gestured for me to follow her before pushing her cart into an aisle where we were out of his sight. 

‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù I whispered to her.  

‚ÄúGirl, didn't they tell you anything when you came here?‚Äù Sandra looked at me like I was crazy. I took this moment to give her a once over.  I remember her always looking haggard and ten years older than her actual age, but now she looked like a sight for sore eyes, with a new hairdo, professionally applied makeup, and nice clothes.

Sandra had a similar story to me, she had left her abusive husband who had apparently had ties with the local street gang in our hometown, and she was absolutely certain that he and his demented friends would gun her down in a drive-by shooting if they saw her out in public.  He had threatened her with this countless times, and she even discreetly confessed to me that he'd told her he killed other people who crossed him the same way and was never found out. She was a middle aged woman with three kids that were in foster care until she could secure herself a house, kids who were presumably at home at that moment. 

‚ÄúWhat is this place?‚Äù I asked her. 

‚ÄúLet's not talk here‚Ä¶ Let's meet at my place.‚Äù 

I followed her to her home in my car, and coincidentally, she lived in my neighborhood maybe a few blocks down. Her three kids were running about playing as we sat and talked in the dining room. 

Sandra explained to me that this town was absolutely perfect, until it came down to the weird smile rule they had. No matter what was going on in your life, if you weren't smiling every second of your time in public, you would be taken into custody, and horrendous things happened to those that were carried away by the Smile Sentinels. She didn't even want to go into detail about it, but she did say that repeat offenders would either disappear or become a Smile Sentinel with a completely reworked personality, as if they'd been brainwashed. 

‚ÄúThings will go well for you if you just do what they say.‚Äù Sandra assured me. ‚ÄúThere's great schools and plenty of jobs here.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBut what happens to the people that disappear, do they get kicked out of town?‚Äù I wanted to know. 

Sandra opened her mouth then closed it, looking away from me in tense silence. She slowly shook her head. ‚ÄúLook‚Ä¶ I think it's best if you don't get too curious, okay?‚Äù 

‚ÄúSandra, what happens to those people?‚Äù I pressed. 

‚ÄúMy name isn't Sandra anymore, it's Diane!‚Äù She snapped. 

‚ÄúI saw this kid who was wearing a mask, and her mother said they put masks on kids who have a hard time with the smiling thing.‚Äù I said, shuddering. ‚ÄúHave your kids ever had to do that?‚Äù

‚Äú...Yes.‚Äù She admitted. ‚ÄúAisha had hurt her knee pretty badly playing outside, so she burst into tears. We were at the park and I hadn't brought my car so I tried to run and carry her back. An officer was patrolling in his car and stopped us, and I begged him to just let me get her home, but‚Ä¶ but he‚Ä¶ he‚Ä¶‚Äù Her eyes watered.

‚ÄúHe what?‚Äù I leaned in, growing concerned. My gaze flicked over to where Aisha, a six year old girl, was sitting with her back to us watching television, more still and silent than a girl her age should be. She was watching a cartoon show where the main characters were in a hospital, and she seemed completely enraptured by it.

‚ÄúHe told me her crying was obscene and I should've had a mask with us to hide her face.‚Äù Sandra continued, choked up. ‚ÄúThen he got out the car and grabbed her, and his- his partner held me back while he- he took something off his belt‚Ä¶ I thought it was mace at first but it wasn't, it was‚Ä¶‚Äù 

*‚ÄúTime for your shot!‚Äù* One of the cartoon characters' bubbly voices cut through our conversation. *‚ÄúThis will only hurt a bit!‚Äù*

Suddenly, Aisha threw her head back and exploded into hysterics. Her keening laughter bounced over the walls and scared the absolute shit out of me. She was laughing so hard the sound was almost aggressive or violent, as weird as that sounds. Tears started running down her face, and her eyes rolled into the back of her head, showing those little red veins. Vomit started to build up in her throat, dribbling down her chin and splashing over her shirt. She gurgled it as she continued laughing through her puking, and it splattered onto the carpet and filled the air with a sour smell. 

The sight was enough to make me want to run out the door, it was incredibly frightening and so abrupt. She looked possessed in every sense of the word. Her siblings stared at her while hugging each other in fear, and Sandra got up and ran to her. 

‚ÄúWhat's wrong with her?!‚Äù I asked, standing up from the table. ‚ÄúShould I call-?‚Äù 

‚ÄúDon't call anyone!‚Äù Sandra yelled back, picking up Aisha and holding her close, letting her vomit get all over her. She started to carry the girl upstairs. ‚ÄúAubrey, turn that shit off! She can't watch this show anymore! She can't watch anything to do with needles!‚Äù 

‚ÄúNeedles‚Ä¶?‚Äù I went over to the bottom of the stairs and watched them go up, desperate for answers. ‚ÄúDid he‚Ä¶inject her with something?‚Äù 

Aisha looked over her mother's shoulder down at me as Sandra got to the top step, her eyes were unseeing and she cackled ceaselessly as vomit and saliva poured down her bottom lip in rivulets. She looked utterly insane, but I don't remember Sandra ever saying anything was wrong with her mentally. 

Sandra shot a glare at me and said, ‚ÄúYou should go home, we'll catch up later,‚Äù then disappeared down the hall. 

Utterly flabbergasted, I left the house and drove to my own place. I replayed the events in my head as I put away my groceries and my new wardrobe. What did they inject that poor little girl with that would give her such horrible PTSD, and how could someone in a position of authority just do that? You're telling me these people can just hurt us whatever way they want with no repercussions? All for being upset in public? 

I felt uneasy that night as I microwaved myself a TV dinner and channel surfed in the living room. Cable and WiFi had already been installed for me, conveniently enough. After I ate that processed junk, I went through my phone to verify what they'd said to me earlier, and indeed, 99% of the websites I usually visited were blocked, presumably by my Wi-Fi network, and by the service they gave me for phone data too. Sandra had said everyone in town used the same provider. Maybe it was like this not to protect us, but to hide what they were doing here to people. Still, I had nowhere else to go and I had been looking forward to this for a long time. Maybe I could stay here until I saved up enough to move elsewhere, to another state even? 

I was just about to call it a night when I heard a commotion outside. I paused the TV and listened. Someone was sobbing and wailing, loud enough to wake the whole street, so I rushed to my front step to see what was going on. 

A couple of houses down, a woman was in hysterics, following a few paradamics as they wheeled someone covered in a white blanket on a stretcher to the ambulance. She eventually collapsed onto her yard sobbing as they put the body in the back of the vehicle. What seemed to be her husband ran to her in a panic and tried to force her up so he could get her back in the house. He was yelling at her. The sight triggered me a little, reminding me of how violently my husband handled me even during my worst moments. 

All the neighbors that were outside immediately retreated into the house, which I thought was odd. Usually people loved to be nosy, and would form a crowd to watch scenes like that. Instead, they were ushering their kids inside and hurrying to slam their doors and shut their blinds. The air was rife with a high tension that made a chill run down my spine, but still, I continued to watch on my doorstep, considering offering help. 

Then I heard a siren. It wasn't a police siren, it honestly reminded me of a fire alarm or a tornado siren. A bright yellow car with flashing neon yellow lights affixed to the roof careened down the street. Smile Sentinels charged out of the vehicle and apprehended the grieving woman. I watched in horror as the husband tried to fight them and got beaten within an inch of his life by their batons. The woman was restrained by two of the officers while a third produced the small canister from their belt. The answers I was seeking became clear to me as it looked like they stabbed something in the side of the woman's face, administering a shot. 

Almost immediately, she started to laugh like a mad woman and fall all over herself in the yard, reminding me of the frantic and discombobulated movements of a rabid animal going nuts. She couldn't seem to walk straight, and she stumbled from side to side and scrambled over the ground as if she were inebriated on all sorts of hard substances, unconcerned with the fact her husband lay unconscious a few feet away in a bloody heap. It was like watching a train wreck, I couldn't tear my eyes away.  

That is, until one of the Smile Sentinels looked my way and I instinctively stepped back inside the house and slammed and locked the door. What the hell did I get myself into? Why would they send depressed victims of abuse such as myself into a place where they could be abused even more? Was protection from my husband worth all this? 

Then I remembered just how terrified that man had me in my own house everyday and decided that I would ignore it all and play along. I know it sounds crazy but...With my husband, there was no chance of safety whatsoever, but here, all I had to do to be safe was smile. I couldn't go back to living in that shelter, let alone living in cheap motels. I just couldn't. 

So I assimilated into this strange private society, making sure I smiled whenever I left my home, and I focused on trying to rebuild my life after my complete mess of a marriage. I met with Sandra more often (I will be referring to her by her old name to avoid confusion) and I found a mundane but remote customer representative job, so I didn't have to leave the house as much. But things became hard to ignore one day when I was out running errands. 

I was driving back home, sipping a to-go cup of coffee, when traffic was held up by a protest. A crowd of people, some wearing custom made frowning masks and some just scowling or crying, filled the street with picket signs protesting the smile law. Those yellow cruisers entered the scene not long after and a legion of Smile Sentinels attacked the protestors, beating and arresting them and loading them into the backs of their cars. This greatly disturbed me, seeing the bruised and bloody faces of those protestors and the blood stains they left on the road. 

Back at home, I watched the local news where the newswoman was grimly informing the public about a rebellion in Smilesville. The rebellion was called the Scowlers, and anyone that was considered to be a part of them would be taken into custody immediately. That's not the bad part, though. What disturbed me was that the Council that ran that small town in place of a mayor, was putting in extremist measures to snuff out the rebellion. Everyone was to wear a smile mask when leaving the house to show their loyalty, that was a new law that would be put in place within the next week. The worst part was that everyone would be required to medicate daily with a less strong version of what they called the Smile Shot, which is what the Sentinels have been using against ‚Äúhysterical‚Äù citizens. The same shit that made that little girl and that woman go ballistic. 

This terrified me and I thought surely they weren't serious. But they were, *Jesus Christ* they *were.* 

Within the next seven days, they introduced this bizarre new lifestyle to everyone in town. Every Monday, every single household would be delivered a package with enough doses of the Smile serum to last a week along with alcohol pads and clean needles. Every tenant in the household had to be medicated daily, including children. Infants were spared of course, but they always had to remain at home, or be given special medication they released specifically for the purpose of 'safely' keeping the baby asleep so as not to cause disturbances. They wouldn't tell people what was in it. The bottle of pills was white with no label of ingredients.

All schools and workplaces opened an hour earlier so you could be tested for the serum, and if it wasn't found in your bloodstream (or there wasn't enough in your bloodstream) you would be administered it right then and there, and that would be a strike. If you got to strike 3, then the Smile Sentinels would be called on you, and good God they got more brutal each time.

This town was insane. As far as I could tell, there was absolutely no normal police department, just an equivalent  for Sentinels (the ‚ÄòSentinel Stations‚Äô) where you could file a report against someone for not smiling as crazy as that sounds, and virtually no real crime other than the ones perpetuated against the smile law and petty thievery or vandalism now and again. It seemed that the Sentinels also served as police, but thieves and vandals would either not be heard from again or brainwashed into a Sentinel rather than being jailed. It was like they were trying so hard to make the perfect place, but it was a dystopian nightmare. 

Since I worked from home, I did not have to be tested daily, so I thought I could get away with not injecting the serum into myself. After all, they didn't tell anyone what was in it, and what if I had a bad reaction to that sickly, vibrant yellow fluid? However, I didn't get away with this, not at all. 

At the end of the first week, I was cooking myself breakfast when I got a knock on the door. The sight I got in the peephole was nothing short of terrifying, there was a prim and proper looking woman standing outside with two male Smile Sentinels behind her. All three of them were wearing these flesh colored, shiny masks with big plastic grins and rosy cheeks, and one of the officers had the handle of a sleek white medical case in his hand. 

I opened the door and the woman raised a pen to the clipboard she was holding and went, ‚ÄúHello, I assume you're Miss Madison Gilmore. I'm an assistant of the Council here to perform your weekly Smile Serum test.‚Äù 

Dumbfounded, I stared at them and their masks of realistic human faces for a few seconds. ‚Äú... What?‚Äù 

‚ÄúIf you could step aside so we can enter, that would be most appreciated!‚Äù The woman chirped. 

‚ÄúI-I‚Äôm busy-‚Äù I stammered, scrambling to find an excuse. 

‚ÄúMa'am,‚Äù the overly joyful voice of one of the Sentinels interrupted me, ‚Äúif you don't step aside we will have to use force. Let's all be happy and compliant today instead!‚Äù 

They forced their way inside, their broad shoulders shoving my underweight frame out of the way easily. The woman strode into the living room after the Sentinels with a pep in her step, ‚ÄúDon't worry, I am a trained nurse and this will not take long!‚Äù 

I sat down nervously as they opened the case and produced a needle. She drew my blood, put it in a tube, gave it to one of the Sentinels, and he left for the van they had parked outside. ‚ÄúHe's just running a quick test.‚Äù The woman said. 

It took maybe around twenty to thirty minutes, with the woman chatting my ear off to pass the time. I was drowning in anxiety and gave her short, blunt answers, before finally the Sentinel returned with a slip of paper in hand. He eyed me through the holes in his eerie mask as he handed the test results to the woman. 

‚ÄúOh dear!‚Äù The woman exclaimed melodramatically. ‚ÄúIt seems that your test came back negative! You haven't been taking your injections, have you?!‚Äù 

‚ÄúPlease, I can explain‚Ä¶‚Äù I nervously looked up at the Sentinels who stared down at me with their hands clasped behind their backs. 

‚ÄúLucky for you, I can give you a dosage.‚Äù She produced a needle loaded with neon yellow fluid from the white case. I stood up frantically, and the Sentinels forced me back down in my seat, holding one of my arms out for the woman to tie a band around my flesh in order for a vein to become visible. ‚ÄúThankfully, this version of the serum can be administered to areas other than the face. This will only hurt a bit.‚Äù 

Oh, how to describe that experience? It felt like they had injected lava into my veins, and my body temperature skyrocketed. My brain began to buzz, I can't even begin to describe that sensation so that's the closest I can get to telling you. I began to have muscle spasms and my limbs twitched and jerked. My eyes watered and tears fell. Suddenly, I cracked a smirk, then a smile, then a full on grin. I felt like a puppet, I couldn't control how the muscles in my face contorted. Every time I tried to force my lips to a flat line, it felt like trying to hold back an inevitable sneeze, or trying to bend an appendage in a way it wasn't meant to be bent, and I failed. It was God awful and I'd sooner shoot myself than endure it again. 

‚ÄúThere we are.‚Äù She said with satisfaction. ‚ÄúI'm afraid I'll have to give you a strike, however, for your inability to follow our rules. Don't fret though, you still have two more until we have to crack the whip on you.‚Äù 

Then, they promptly left, and I was left a shaking mess, not because I was scared, that was yet another symptom. The symptoms weren't all just physical though, it was also mental anguish. For the rest of the day, every time I felt even remotely negative, like for example remembering the cruel words my husband hurled at me or thinking about how I wish I could have a glow up like Sandra's because of how ugly I felt; the serum would punish me. I would feel a shock shoot through me, like static electricity when you run your feet on the carpet and touch metal. *Especially* when I would feel fear thinking about what was happening in this town, the effects tripled. Then I would suffer a God awful migraine and a feeling of euphoric high, which made me feel like I was tripping on acid more than truly happy. 

During this high, I would burst into a fit of uncontrollable laughter that would go on for so long I almost suffocated, my sides and my face aching horrendously. It was like being tickled to the point of torture, with the person tickling you not letting up even though you couldn't breathe and tears were running down your face and you were about to vomit. And vomit, I certainly did. A lot. I grew tired of the acidic taste of bile in my throat, and my brain felt like it was chock full of a swarm of bees, but I couldn't make any of it stop. As the hours ticked by, it got slightly better to deal with, but just the thought of doing this everyday terrified me‚Ä¶

Running errands in town became more interesting of an experience, as everyone else was also suffering the symptoms of the Smile Serum. I couldn't seem to get used to people around me bursting into fits of cackles without warning, for seemingly no reason whatsoever, and I jumped out of my skin every time. Smilesville seemed to turn into a town of ‚Äòsmile junkies,‚Äô as the rebels called us, tripping off a high no one's seen before, rivaling the unpredictable behavior of methheads and crackheads. When getting lunch, I saw a table full of bereaved individuals wearing black who clearly just returned from a funeral procession, but they grinned like the Cheshire cat and howled with mad laughter like the Joker as endless tears poured down from their torment-filled eyes.

I vented about all this when I had a coffee with Sandra next, at her house of course, and she shared my sentiments. Her kids hated shots and made that very clear with tantrums, same as the other elementary schoolers, but over time the injections warped the way they behaved. She cried to me, wishing she had her children back the way they were. She said it felt like they were in what she called ‚Äòla la land' all the time, like they weren't ‚Äòall there‚Äô if you catch my drift, and I felt for her. 

‚ÄúI'm starting to think maybe those ‚ÄòScowlers‚Äô or whatever they were called were right.‚Äù Sandra sighed, running her hand through her hair and watching as Aubrey, her eldest, giggled and mindlessly ran around the kitchen in circles for no particular reason. ‚ÄúIt's not worth all this.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I agreed hesitantly. I was lying, actually. Even though this all felt hellish, the abuse of my husband lingered in the back of my mind, and the loneliness I had felt, too. Even though it was like Crazy Town, I could feel somewhat a sense of community in Smilesville. Even though those smiles and kind gestures were forced, it was better than the dark reality back home, where my peers coldly ignored my swollen eye and bloody nose, and strangers didn't spare me a sideways glance. 

But I soon would realize just how awful things were in Smilesville, as the situation escalated beyond control. 

People were being outed as Scowlers more and more, anonymous tips being made and sending Sentinels barging through their doors. They were not seen again. Sandra told me that there were spies for the Council hidden everywhere, they were simply normal townspeople secretly given the responsibility of finding members of the Scowlers and pretending to want to join their ranks in order to bust them. You didn't even have to participate in protests to be a Scowler, you just had to refuse to take the serum. As much as I hated the injections, I knew it had to be done, but Sandra told me a way to get away with taking less was injecting it every two days rather than daily. It was still harrowing for my mind and body but I found that I coped better. 

I thought about it long and hard, and I finally contacted my case worker and asked her to meet with me at my house. Mrs. Stratton arrived with an ugly smile mask and sat across from me at my dining room table. ‚ÄúSo what is it you would like to discuss, Miss Gilmore?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI want to move.‚Äù I explained, a painful smile stuck on my tear-soaked face. ‚ÄúI want to leave this program, and find somewhere else to live. It's just not worth the suffering.‚Äù 

Mrs. Stratton stared at me through her mask for a few painfully silent moments, then sighed. ‚ÄúOkay, hon. Let me gather the paperwork and get back to you on that.‚Äù 

This instilled me with hope and I hugged her before she left. I was so ecstatic to be leaving that I started packing some of my things straight away that night. At this point I had lived here for a few months, while enduring this smile serum nonsense for one whole month, and I was fully prepared to get on the road and never look back even if it meant I'd be without a home for a while. 

Oh God, if only I'd known what chaos would transpire next, I would've packed everything and left that very night.

Weirdly enough, after 2 hours of feeling like that I‚Äôm back to my regular self joking around and have energy.

I tried coffee at 4pm, it helps a little but not significantly enough to handle my kids energy levels lol

I‚Äôm trying to drink more water and eat properly daily but it‚Äôs not helping the dump.

1gsc7rd,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1gsc7rd/stopping_doomscrolling_is_really_fucking_hard/,"Stopping doomscrolling is really fucking hard with ADHD... but it's really, really worth it, and there are tools that help a lot","PSA in response to posts this week

**Stopping doomscrolling is** ***really, really fucking hard*** **with ADHD**, and willpower alone generally isn't enough for us to stop. It's not a personal character flaw. The entire internet these days is optimized to suck our attention through our phones.

**But it's really, really worth it**. I managed to drastically reduce my doomscrolling basically by blocking the hell out of everything bad on the internet. It made my ADHD symptoms and anxiety much better, basically on par with starting to take meds

* I couldn't browse during the workday. I started tasks faster, my job reviews improved, and my work stress went down
* I couldn't escape to the internet when I felt sad/scared. I started paying more attention to my feelings and my emotional regulation improved. I also started reaching out to my closest friends to talk about what was going on more often, and some of those relationships got deeper and more real
* I couldn't browse uninterrupted for long enough to get bad hyperfocus (the ""I'm thirsty but can't stop to drink / sleepy but can't go to bed"" kind). My health and fitness improved slightly

**There are tools that make it much easier**. I like OneSec and Apple's Focus settings, and have also heard great things about Freedom and ColdTurkey. Good features:

* A ""hard block"". Use this for apps and websites that you *always regret*, e.g., sewer-quality news or icky porn
* A ""scheduled block"". Use this for apps and sites that you enjoy but shouldn't visit at work
   * I also block the whole internet from half an hour before bed until half an hour after wakeup, so I can wind down in the evening, and wake up to sunrise and coffee instead of stressful new alerts
* A ""limit"". Useful for apps and websites that you enjoy but shouldn't use all day (e.g., reddit, social media)
* A ""delay"". Use this for apps and websites that you need access to, but should probably only look at occasionally, not in every spare minute
   * This is an intentionally irritating delay that takes away the dopamine hit from opening an app. Some of them also make you do an annoying task like flipping your phone or solving a slow and boring puzzle. It makes you want to open the app only when you need it, not when you're bored
   * It's helpful to add an ""interruption"" feature that repeats the delay every 10 minutes or so, in case you get distracted and start doomscrolling once you're in

**You have to make the tools work for you**. It's common to have some challenges and need to customize the settings repeatedly. 

If you block your favorite doomscrolling websites, out of habit you'll probably look for other websites to doomscroll. You'll have to go and block those too.

Occasionally, you'll be locked out of something useful (e.g., new parking meters that have to be paid online, or needing the internet at an odd hour during an emergency). It's helpful to have a loophole - I can unlock everything by going through a really annoying three-minute delay; my boyfriend had me set up a password that he doesn't know but can get from several places if needed.

Honestly, the nuisance of customizing the tools and occasionally having them work wrong is *really, really small* compared to losing hours per day to uncontrolled doomscrolling.

Good luck and DM if you want to try this but need help on the details.

But then again, men never approach me. I had this one guy stare at me for the whole year and never once talked to me, seemed like a confident dude too.

1gsbnud,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gsbnud,Stracci Pizza & La Tingeria ,"I managed to hit 2 new-to-me restaurants over the long weekend that I‚Äôd been meaning to visit for some time.  I assigned ratings to the best things that I‚Äôll come back for again and would recommend.

 

Up first was Stracci Pizza, 106 Hume Ave in Alexandria. It‚Äôs Roman style pizza, with a beautifully fermented dough that gets full of bubbles, a tremendous and bright sauce and‚Ä¶ they make their own Stracci cheese -torn shreds of fresh Mozzarella!

 

I usually order a bunch the first time I visit a place to figure out what I‚Äôll get on future visits, and this was no exception. While the salad $14 and mini cannolo $3 were great, and the Johnny Za Za pizza with sausage, onions and an oregano cream $18 was solid, - I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the cold oregano cream with it and found the onions, which I normally love, to have a bit more bite than I prefer.   The standouts for me were the Stracci Pizza $16, which I ‚Äòd rate an 8.4 and I added garlic to. In the future I‚Äôd drop the garlic but add extra sauce and their tender and flavorful meatballs $16 if getting as a side of 3, which are among the best I‚Äôve had, rated 9.2, but will give a better bang for the buck as a topping! The other star was their Tiramisu, $10,  rated 9.4 which came in a clear dish to see the gorgeous, creamy, coffee buzz inducing layers, and is the best version I‚Äôve had!

As a side note, excellent date spot, though the inside is loud an echoey. Outside with the heat lamps is pleasant if the weather isn‚Äôt too bad! Also, their hours may be a bit of a pain if you‚Äôre coming from outside the immediate area like I was- 5-8:30 Tu-Th ,5-9 Fri and Sat, closed Sun / Mon.        

 

               The next day, I headed to Falls Church to La Tingeria. 626 S Washington St. for some tacos, tostadas and churros! Their meat is Halal, which I don‚Äôt recall seeing at any area taqueria. The standouts for me were the tender, juicy and flavorful Taco De Birria Goat (Lamb) and Taco De Birria Beef - $3.50 each, 8.5 rating for each, and the Taco Hal Pastor also $3.50 ‚Äì like Al Pastor, but with smoked chicken instead of pork ‚Äì which was fresh, and also a flavor bomb! I‚Äôd rate it a 9.3. I got their hot sauces to try but really didn‚Äôt need them! I also loved their Churro $2 or 3 for $5, which tastes very fresh and fluffy inside, but a nice crisp on the outside and has a surprising little ribbon of filling that is either caramel or some kind of cinnamon cream maybe? 9.6 for the Churro!

I also tried and liked, but less so, their Carne Asada taco $4, which though plentiful, wasn‚Äôt quite as tender as I‚Äôd like and their Beef Tinga Tostada and Chicken Tinga Tostada $4 each that were enhanced by their chipotle garlic sauce, but just weren‚Äôt at the level of the better tacos for me. The flavors of their 3 sauces I did try had distinct flavor, but not much in the way of heat.       

    

    I also ended up getting their Tres Leche to go and after telling them their Churros were the best I‚Äôd had, ordering a 3 pack to swing by my sister and brother in law‚Äôs place and surprise them and their kids with them! I like the Tres Leche a lot, but not nearly as much as the Churro! The also threw in a Tostada on the house in the to go order, which made for a perfect late-night snack!

EDIT; this is a REAL stretch but if anyone who sees this has been to the bay area, and knows of the place jay's coffee tea and treats, the way they do their egg is what im referring to. the thing is, ive never disected my sandwich before eating it to see exactly how it's done. it is an enigma how they make their sandwiches.",0,1731718613.0,AskNYC,19,0.41,False

I have tried and failed to brew a decent shot and sadly now reached the end of the bag. All shots starting at 18g. In short, I‚Äôve been both grinding finer and increasing yield and very incrementally improving taste but now I‚Äôm at a point where I‚Äôve choked the machine and my shots still taste slightly sour. What are my options here? Do I grind coarser (dial back to 16-17) but aim for an even higher yield (i.e. 50g+)? Is a grind of 15.5 the sweet spot?

Bean: Fritz Coffee Single Origin Bourbon Washed Tamana Blend  
Roast Date: 10/31/24  
Grinder: DF64 Gen 2  
Machine: Breville Barista Express

Attempts (18g in):  
Grind 22, Output 38g, 30 seconds, extremely sour  
Grind 20, Output 40g, 35 seconds, extremely sour  
Grind 18, Output 42g, 40 seconds, very sour  
Grind 17, Output 45g, 47 seconds, slightly sour  
Grind 16, Output 45g, 52 seconds, a noticeably better smelling shot and less sour taste but still with some sour notes on the back end  
Grind 15, choked machine

Am I missing something big? If anyone has experience with these beans would love any input. Thanks!

I've (36F) been on three dates - two planned, one impromptu - with a guy (38). We each had different evening plans after our third date (afternoon coffee), but stayed in touch a bit by text.

At one point in the conversation I asked if I could join his activity (sport) to observe. According to my read receipt, he read that message within 5 minutes of receiving it. 

However, he didn't reply until an hour and a half later. I have no issue at all with the delay - I had already gone home and fallen asleep. I also wouldn't have minded if he'd replied immediately and said not today or that he's not comfortable with me joining him at his sport yet.

What his reply said instead is, ""I just finished and I didn't see your text because I didn't see your text."" But the read receipt shows clearly that the message was viewed. 

I'm sure we all believe honesty and respect are key in a potential relationship. How would you personally choose to address a situation like this? Or have you had this happen and did it indicate a larger tendency towards dishonesty if you ended up dating that person?",0,1731718457.0,AskWomenOver30,2,0.5,False

*Both* of these little semen demons were up at the asscrack of dawn today, wide awake, no putting them back down. I forgot to set the coffee machine last night, so no coffee out on the shop to sip for a few while they goof off in their rooms. Eldritch 4yo daughter comes out while I'm still swearing under my breath to chase her favorite shop cat (adorable, but not before caffeine). I take her back in. They both scream about not being allowed to drink the month-old iced cold brew I pull out of the back of the fridge. They both scream about not being allowed to go wake up their grandpa before breakfast. They both scream about what's for breakfast. They both scream about what *they* asked to watch on the TV. They both scream about it when grandpa finally gets up and takes them for a walk. They both scream about not getting to swing on the *red* swing. They both scream about it being time for naps. They both scream (taking turns) for *two fucking hours straight* that they're nOt TiReD aNd DoN't WaNnA nap. And, now that I've given up, gotten them both back up, and made them do my chores with me, they're both screaming about how they're *bored* and *tired*, and I'm not proud of how many times I've told them to *fucking suck it up and be fucking quiet* today because *the only fucking thing that makes the difference between me being able to handle their bullshit with poise and me being a shouting bitch* is getting like... 20 minutes a day where they're both not all up in my shit. Seriously. 20 minutes in the morning. That's all I need to myself. I get great mileage on it. I'd be EPA gold-star no-emissions approved if I was a car and those 20 minutes of blessed silence were fuel.
