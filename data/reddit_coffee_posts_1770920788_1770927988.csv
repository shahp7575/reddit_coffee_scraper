I'm struck between those two. **KitchenAid KF8 Fully vs Jura ENA 8**

**KitchenAid KF8**  
**Dose per shot:** Typically \~10–12 g for a *single espresso* and \~17–19 g for a *double espresso* — this is

  
**Jura ENA 8**

**Dose per cycle:** \~6–10 g of coffee per drink cycle — this is relatively *lighter/less coffee per cup* compared

  
So KF8 wins the dose battle this, but Jura looks and feels more premium. 

Any users of those two machines who can help to pick?

Same for my husband (she’s like his mom to in a non weird way). And we are so lucky to have her live close-ish to us. Without traffic, we are about 45min drive away from each other. 

Up until recently, the plan was for her to come spend a few days a week with us to help with baby if needed (she never imposed. She just made herself available). She even offered to stay overnight to help with shifts to allow my husband and I to rest since he’ll be working full time when baby arrives. 

Unfortunately, a couple weeks ago, my step dad (her husband), lost his job. He was only 2 years away from retirement which hurts even more. Because he is sick and old, the odds of him finding a new job are bleak. Because of this, my mom had to jump on a part time job. It’s a small gig, barely pays and has no benefits (The woman went to law school but because it was in Europe, her degrees aren’t valid here. Isn’t that a bitch?). 

Yesterday was her last day before starting her job. She was crying because she won’t be able to be here with/for us with baby next month and has no idea when she’ll be free if ever. The reality of her coming over when she gets off work is that it’s not realistic. She’ll get off right when traffic hits and at this point, we’re talking 1.5-2h drive to me only for her to have to get back home to cook dinner etc for her borderline useless husband. I mentioned we would see each other on the weekends but she brought up that the odds of me driving to her with a newborn on the weekends are small especially since Saturday will be the only day I have with my husband and Sunday she has to take drive my sister who is still in high school to her clubs. 

I admit I hadn’t thought about it at all. But now I’m finding myself somewhat stressing at this new reality. All the fun days and support I thought I’d have with my mom and baby are gone. She’s not really going to see him much. I won’t have her to go out with during the day while my husband is at work (none of my friends have kids so I was really banking on going out for coffee with her etc).

I haven’t even grasped how much harder having a newborn will be without the extra help. But I’m guessing it’ll be really tough. 

I know this is a super common situation (moms not being near. People not having a safe group/village). I guess I just had to get it off my chest. To anyone else going through this, I feel for you. ",1,1770927596.0,pregnant,2,1.0,False
1r349lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1r349lj/aitah_for_doubting_my_boyfriends_suicidal_crisis/,AITAH for doubting my boyfriend’s suicidal crisis after he lied?,"Throwaway account for privacy because I am very active on Reddit and do not want this tied to my main. Also I apolgize for the long text or typos, I wanted to give as much context as possible as anyone close to me is split on the situation.



My boyfriend and I are both in our early twenties and have been dating for a few months.

On December 24th, he told me he had planned a date for us. It ended up being to meet at a park while it was pouring rain to grab coffee and sit outside. I had been feeling sick and did not want to sit in the cold rain, so I told him I did not really want to do that. That same morning, my boss texted asking if I could cover shifts the following weekend due to a family emergency. We had a camping trip planned for that weekend, and I had to cancel because I needed to work. We planned it around my usual days off, but I could not have anticipated being asked to cover.

From his perspective, I cancelled the camping trip and then did not want to meet him at the park on the same day. We argued on the 24th about it. That night, technically early morning of the 25th around 2am, is when everything happened.

On the 26th, we talked and that is when he admitted he felt insecure about money and assumed I did not want to spend time with him unless he could spend money on me. I explained that was not true at all. I was just sick and did not want to sit in the rain. He seemed to move past it quickly after that conversation. A few days later, we planned to go out to dinner.

At that dinner is where everything went down.

While we were sitting in the restaurant, he brought up the night of the 24th and 25th again and said he had been so upset he could not sleep. He said he went to the gym at 2am, then came home, packed a bag, and went on a 4am hike. He also mentioned that his mom had joked that maybe he had another girlfriend because he was out all night.



The second he repeated that joke, I got this awful feeling in my stomach. I had to excuse myself to the restroom because I felt physically sick. When I came back, I asked for the check because I could not just sit there pretending I was fine. He kept trying to get me to stay and said this was all his mom’s fault for making a dumb joke.



Later that night, I looked up local gym hours and could not find any 24 hour locations open overnight on Christmas for the chain he said he went to, which I will call Gym A. When I asked him about it, the story shifted. First it was not Gym A, it was a different 24 hour gym, which I will call Gym B. Then he said he had day passes stored, even though he only has a membership at Gym A.



After more back and forth, he admitted he lied. He had not gone to the gym at all. He said he went to a friend’s house because he was spiraling and having suicidal thoughts. He said he did not feel safe being alone that night and did not want to scare or burden me, which is why he lied. He insisted he did not cheat.



He begged me not to tell his family or my friends about what he said happened that night. He said he did not want anyone knowing about his mental health struggles and asked me to keep it between us. He told me I could be mad if I wanted but that he did not cheat, and then he hung up.



We met up the next day to talk in person. I asked for reassurance. He said he would never let me read his texts because that was a boundary we could not come back from, but he offered to text the friend in front of me so I could see. He turned his phone slightly away from me and appeared to send something. Later that same night, he admitted he did not actually send anything at all. He said he felt he did not need to explain himself after opening up about something so personal.

We did not previously share locations, but after everything happened he offered to share his location for my peace of mind.

He has also previously told me he does not really have friends in the area because he just moved here from across the country, which makes this unnamed friend confusing to me.

Then his mom texted me apologizing for the joke and saying she has no reason to believe he is unfaithful. I was shocked she reached out. I never wanted her involved in our relationship issues. Apparently he asked her to message me. She does not know he admitted he lied about where he was.

He has actively made me feel guilty for questioning his story about being suicidal. He says I should have just believed him when he opened up about something that serious, and that by questioning it I am basically accusing him of faking a crisis. I never want to question something like that. The only reason I doubted it is because he opened with a lie and kept changing the story. He says he lied because he did not want me to know about his mental health struggles.

At this point, I do not have proof he cheated. But he lied about where he was, changed the story multiple times, only admitted the truth after I pushed, pretended to text someone for proof and later admitted he did not, asked me to keep it secret, involved his mom without telling her the full story, and has made me feel guilty for questioning him.

I feel like my trust is completely broken. My gut tells me something bigger happened, but I do not have hard proof.

I genuinely do not know if I am overreacting or if these are serious red flags. I do not ever want to invalidate someone who says they were having suicidal thoughts. But I also feel like opening with a lie and continuing to lie makes it hard to just blindly accept that explanation.



So AITA for not believing him and feeling like I cannot move past this?



TLDR: We argued after I cancelled a camping trip because of work and did not want to sit in the rain for coffee. That night at 2am on December 25th he said he went to the gym, but the story kept changing. He later admitted he lied and actually went to a friend’s house because he was having suicidal thoughts. He begged me not to tell anyone, pretended to text the friend for proof and later admitted he did not, and now says I am wrong for doubting him. I do not have proof he cheated, but the lying destroyed my trust. AITA?",2,1770927578.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

Curious me.","Story Time: I was searching for an affordable house and lot because so I came across many developments. What stood up on my research was Lancaster New City kahit may issues ako nakikita, this seems to be a good fit sa needs ko.  
  
Kaya nag visit ako sa isang friend na 3 years palang sa Lancaster by riding a bus 201 bus from PITX (bitin sa byahe kasi patulog ka palang nandun kana. Pero good points).   
  
Got off sa gate nila na muntik pa ko masagasaan ng unknown car na may pulang guhit pababa sa hood tapos  pinaglakad lang nila ang bisita for full experience daw. While walking sa google link na sinend, I noticed a huge Lexus SUV naka park sa kalsada with another Lexus na van sa loob ng garahe of the same house. Napa sana all lang ako pero continue lakad and I saw some BMWs and BYDs sa pag lakad ko. Sabi ko ah baka dito lang.   
  
I reached the pin sa google maps sa isang corner house na may dalawang Tesla sa loob ng garahe, both Grey. Ito na pala ang house ni friend (sana all). So we went out to visit our other friend within a Lancaster townhouse village before heading to But First Coffee. To my surprise, I see some Audis (old and new models) and a Mercedes Benz (Bnew) na nag mamaneobra ipasok sa garage yung car sa village ni friend 2 so na curious na tuloy ako and started observing the parking lot of Shopwise. 

Upon observing common sight ang sandamakmak na brand new vehicles of all brands and many Tesla, BYD, Mercedes Benz, BMW, Audi, Lexus, Land Rover, Volvo,  and other expensive vehicles  sa Lancaster. You'll see some older models din pero well kept and maintained doesn't look like chubibo rides.. When we got to our other friends' villages, wlang expensive cars.

The Curious question ay. Bakit ang daming gnitong klaseng ng sasakyan sa Lancaster? diba Lancaster's market is low cost housing for low income people like me? ",1,1770927376.0,cavite,0,1.0,False

I’ve spent years working every position in restaurants. I thought I knew what made guests happy. I was measuring the wrong things.

**The Lie We Tell Ourselves About Guest Experience**

We measure table turns. Time from order to entree. Check average. We track these numbers because they’re easy to track. A kitchen timer doesn’t care about nuance. Your POS system spits out reports that look scientific.

Guests don’t care about any of that.

I learned this the hard way, working with a gastropub in Redmond. They had the best metrics in the ownership group. Average ticket time 12 minutes from order to first course. 90 second drink delivery. Our table turns hit 2.3 on Friday nights, which made ownership high-five them during the monthly meeting.

Our Yelp score was 3.5 stars.

The guests didn’t love them. They left reviews saying the place felt “rushed” and “impersonal.” One regular told me at the bar that eating there felt like an oil change. Fast. Efficient. Soulless.

They were optimizing for the wrong metrics. The numbers we measured had nothing to do with the experience guests wanted.

**Recognition**

Guests measure restaurants the way you measure a conversation with an old friend. Did you feel seen? Did anyone care that you were there?

These things are hard to quantify. You can’t put them in a spreadsheet. So, we ignore them and measure speed instead.

The first metric guests use is recognition. The host glancing at their seating chart and saying your name because OpenTable told them to? That does nothing. The server who remembers you ordered your burger medium-rare last time does everything. The bartender sees you walk in and starts making your drink before you sit down.

I worked at a neighborhood spot on Capitol Hill where we had a regular named Bill. Bill came in every Tuesday at 6:30 pm. Sat in the same seat at the bar. Ordered a Maker’s Mark neat and the Bolognese. After three visits, our bartender, Kelly, had his drink ready when he walked through the door.

Bill tipped 40% every single visit. He brought friends. When those friends asked him why he loved the place, he never mentioned the food. He said, “They know me there.”

According to a Cornell University study on restaurant hospitality, personalized service increases guest satisfaction scores by 23%. Personalization doesn’t mean training your staff to parrot someone’s name back at them. It means remembering what matters to them.

Most restaurants train staff to input guest preferences into their reservation system. The notes sit in a database nobody checks. Amanda kept a notebook behind the bar with regulars’ orders written in her own handwriting. Low-tech. Effective. She cared.

That’s the thing managers never track. Who cares, and who is just going through the motions?

**Speed Isn’t Timing**

I managed at a steakhouse where management obsessed over ticket times. Entrees had to hit the table within twenty minutes of firing. The kitchen would push out medium-well ribeyes at nineteen minutes and fifty seconds.

Good servers read the table. They watch body language. They notice when guests are leaning in close, when they’re scanning the room, when they have put down their forks and are ready for the next thing.

Servers could pause the running of their entrees. They wouldn’t stand at the edge of the table, plates in hand, waiting for a break in a very serious conversation of a posh couple. It wouldn’t appear robotic. The moment wouldn’t be ruined.

The couple was celebrating an anniversary. They wanted their food to arrive when they were ready for it, not when the kitchen timer said so. They wanted things their way. The ticket time metric for this table was lost, but the couple got what they wanted.

Nelson is a server I worked with, and he’s like a jazz drummer. He could handle six tables and make each one feel like he was in no rush. His secret was noticing when guests shifted gears. When they stopped talking and started looking around, he appeared. When they were deep in conversation, he vanished.

His table turns were slightly slower than average. His tips were 30% higher. Reviews only brag about how great he is. Nelson made more because he understood a metric nobody bothered to measure.

**Guests Want Control**

This is the metric that matters most and gets ignored the most.

Think about the last time you dined out. What made you feel good? Probably not the food, unless it was unequalled or terrible. You felt good when you could get someone’s attention without waving your arms. When you could modify your order without the server acting as if you asked them to solve a differential equation. When the check appeared exactly when you wanted it, not when the manager decided your table needed to flip.

Control. That is what guests are measuring.

I saw this breakdown at a tapas place in Bellevue. The concept was classic small plates, meant for sharing. The kitchen sent everything out as it was ready, no coursing, no timing. Guests would get four dishes in the first three minutes and then nothing for twenty minutes. Then the kitchen would fire the last six dishes at once.

Guests couldn’t control the pace. They couldn’t predict when food would arrive. They couldn’t pair items the way they wanted to. It turned eating into a stressful guessing game.

According to research from the Journal of Hospitality Management, perceived control over the dining experience is the strongest predictor of guest satisfaction, even stronger than food quality. When guests feel like they’re directing the experience, they rate everything higher. The food tastes better. The ambiance feels more comfortable. They tip more.

Most restaurants give guests almost no control. You can’t get your server’s attention without catching their eye during one of their predetermined table sweeps. You can’t adjust the temperature, the music volume, or the lighting. You can’t move to a different table if yours wobbles or sits under a vent blasting arctic air.

The best restaurant I ever worked at gave guests control in small ways. Servers and bussers carried extra napkins and silverware in their trays, so guests never had to ask. We kept the guest checks in a server’s apron pocket until the guest signaled they wanted it. If someone asked to move tables, we moved them, no questions.

These things cost nothing. They shift power from the restaurant to the guest.

**Count Your Apologies**

This is the metric that reveals how broken your operation is.

Guests measure restaurants by friction points. Every time something goes wrong, they make a mental note. Forgot the side of ranch. Brought the wrong beer. Appetizer arrived after the entrees. Each mistake adds weight.

What matters is how you recover. Guests don’t expect perfection. They expect you to care when things go sideways.

I dined at a farm-to-table spot where the chef changed the menu daily based on what came from the farms. Beautiful concept. Execution was chaos. Servers didn’t know what was 86’d until they rang in an order. Frustrating for everyone.

Every night, servers had to return to tables and apologize. “I am sorry, we’re out of the halibut.” “My apologies, the kitchen just ran out of Brussels sprouts.” The apology count some nights hit thirty or forty across the floor.

Guests don’t measure how often you apologize, but they do measure what you do afterwards.

Do you offer an alternative that is equal or better? Do you comp something to acknowledge the inconvenience? Do you take ownership, or do you blame the kitchen, the supplier, the weather?

The restaurants that recover well turn mistakes into moments that build loyalty. A server who says, “We’re out of the halibut, but the chef just brought in wild king salmon this morning, and I will make sure it’s perfect for you,” has just created a better experience than if nothing had gone wrong.

According to Yale School of Management research, guests who experience a service failure followed by strong recovery report higher satisfaction than guests who experienced no problems at all. The recovery is the opportunity. Most restaurants waste it by making the guest feel like an inconvenience.

Every good restaurant has a recovery budget. Money set aside for comping dishes, sending out free desserts, taking drinks off checks. Most nights, that budget sat there unused while servers apologized their way through service and offered nothing. Managers are so worried about giving away anything that they let guests leave angry instead.

The math doesn’t make sense. A $12 appetizer costs you maybe $3 in food. You send it out after a kitchen mistake, and the guest tips an extra 10% on a $100 check. You just made $7 and bought loyalty. Instead, we let them walk out the door and never come back.

**Atmosphere Comes From Your People**

You could spend six figures on reclaimed wood, Edison bulbs, and a Spotify playlist curated by someone who went to Coachella once. Guests will walk in and say it feels cold.

I have worked in high-end steakhouses with million-dollar buildouts that felt warm and inviting. I have worked in a burger joint with trendy decor that felt like a tomb. The difference was never the furniture.

Guests measure the atmosphere by watching how staff interact with each other. Do servers help each other when someone is in the weeds? Does the bartender laugh with the busser? Does the expo call out an order without sounding like a prison warden?

When the staff hate each other or hate being there, guests feel it. You can’t hide dysfunction with good lighting.

I worked at a small seafood restaurant in Ballard. The dining room was a glorified shack. Picnic tables. Paper plates. Box fans that barely moved the humid air. The place was packed all the time because the staff liked coming to work. The owner treated everyone with respect. The chef trained his cooks instead of screaming at them. Servers shared tips evenly and helped run food even for tables that weren’t theirs.

The vibe in that place. You walked in and felt it before you even sat down.

According to a Cornell Center for Hospitality Research study, employee satisfaction correlates directly with guest satisfaction at a rate of 0.82. In research terms, they’re nearly identical.

So, when I hear owners talk about remodeling the dining room, updating the lighting, or hiring a designer to pick new chairs, I want to ask them, “How much are you investing in making your staff not miserable?”

A server who is burned out, underpaid, and working in a toxic environment will make your million-dollar buildout feel like a DMV waiting room.

**The Check Drop Ruins Everything**

You execute a perfect service for ninety minutes and ruin it in the final five.

The check drop is where most restaurants fail. Either the server disappears, and guests sit for twenty minutes, or the server drops the check too early, and guests feel rushed out the door.

I see this when I dine out a lot. Service was flawless. Courses timed perfectly. Wine poured correctly. Then the server would drop the check while my party still had wine in their glasses and was starting to nibble at the desserts that just arrived.

Managers had told servers to present the check as soon as the desserts hit the table to speed up table turns. Guests felt ambushed. They went from relaxed to tense in seconds. Many of them never came back.

The best servers I have worked with treat the check like a negotiation. They ask if guests want anything else. They let the table sit for a few minutes before circling back. They read cues. If guests are lingering over coffee and talking, the check waits. If they’re checking their watches and scanning for the server, it’s time.

What guests want is simple. They want to leave when they’re ready to leave, not when you need their table.

According to the National Restaurant Association, the final five minutes of a meal disproportionately affect overall satisfaction scores. A guest who feels rushed at the end will rate the entire experience lower, even if everything before that was great.

Did the guest feel like they decided when to leave, or did the restaurant push them out? That’s what they remember.

**What You Measure Tomorrow**

Stop measuring table turns and ticket times. Start tracking recognition moments. How many regulars did your staff remember tonight? How many guests got service that felt personal instead of scripted?

Train your servers to read rhythm, not clocks. Give guests small controls. Let them move tables. Let them adjust orders that don’t destroy the dishes without friction.

Count your apologies and fix what causes them. Then teach your staff to recover in ways that build loyalty instead of resentment.

Watch your staff. Your atmosphere comes from them, not your decor budget.

Let guests control when they leave.

I think about Bill sometimes. The regular at that Capitol Hill spot who tipped 40% because Kelly remembered his drink. He stopped coming in after she left for another job. We hired someone new. Trained them on the POS, the menu, the table numbers. They didn’t have Kelly’s notebook.

The new bartender was fast. Efficient. Hit all the metrics. Bill came in twice, paid his check, left 15%. Then he stopped coming.

We measure everything except what matters.

1r343e8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1r343e8/follow_up_from_my_last_post/,Follow up from my last post.,"Hi. I wanted to follow up from my last post from yesterday or the day before. I met with my pcp today who said that I should follow my pyschiatrists guidance and try the nortryptiline 10mg and then follow up again in a little bit. They did not order any other urine or blood tests and did not yet refer me to a urologist yet. They want to see how I do first. I don’t know how long it takes for the nortryptiline to work. Does anyone here? I must say I think the yeast infection is clearing up a bit because I only peed 22x yesterday and I’ve only peed about 10x today. 
My pcp also suggested trying to cut out (or cut back on) seltzer, diet ginger ale and Diet Coke, which I really don’t want to do. I did read online that not everyone with IC is affected by the same things though. He was just reading off a list from his computer from an IC website (so who knows if those are my triggers). With my type 1 diabetes, I also HAVE TO use artificial sweeteners (my preference is sweet and low) so that is not something I can cut out (Splenda doesn’t taste sweet enough and stevia gives me a headache). He also mentioned cutting out (or back on) coffee and chocolate which will be nearly impossible for me to do. (But again he was reading off a website). I believe he also mentioned tomatoes (which I don’t eat) and citrus fruit. Diabetes and my other disabilities already take so much from my life that I really hope I don’t have IC and have to lose more. But I guess we shall see how the next few weeks go (I’m
Tapering off Prozac by taking it every other day for the next two weeks) . I’m kind of upset and annoyed. Tomorrow I see my endocrinologist so I guess I’ll ask her for more advice. If you guys have any advice for me I would appreciate it. Honestly I’m just hoping recovering from the yeast infection, trying the nortryptiline and tapering Prozac works and I don’t have to make any other changes. That would be ideal.

Movies stay the anchor— but unused time, unused space, and unused demographics are lost revenue. Here’s a structured, multi-generation campus model that turns a theater into a destination. My Concept.","AMC, a new destination without turning it into chaos.

Concept:

AMC Theater Campus

This idea transforms moviegoing into a structured, multi-generation destination by integrating films, retail, zoned gaming, social cafés, and event space under one operationally disciplined roof.

— IF YOU'RE NOT INTO A LONG, BUT STILL NOT COMPLETE EXPLANATION, GO NO FURTHER!

1. OVERALL DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

Movies remain the anchor.

Idle space must produce revenue.

Different age groups require different environments.

Comfort increases dwell time.

Fair pricing increases goodwill and spending.

Noise, light, and walking distance control behavior.

Expansion must be earned, not assumed.

Safety must be visible but not oppressive.

This is a campus — not a chaotic entertainment warehouse.

(My Concept, AI organized)

2. ENTRANCE FLOW & ZONING LOGIC

When guests enter:

Left — Old Timers Café (OPL)

Center — AMC Concessions & Movie Access

Right — GameStop Hub

Deeper Interior — Arcade & Social Zones

No one is forced through chaos.

Every demographic has a natural direction.

3. OLD TIMERS CAFÉ (OPL) — LEFT AT ENTRY

Purpose:

A dignified, calm, accessible space for seniors and grandparents.

Location:

Immediate left upon entry. Minimal walking distance.

Why It Exists:

Grandparents often accompany families.

They don’t always want the arcade.

They may or may not attend the movie.

Without a place for them, they often don’t come.

Design Features:

Quiet seating

Clear sightlines to main entrance

Comfortable booths

Coffee, pie, floats, light desserts

Classic soda fountain aesthetic (refreshable by decade)

Acoustic separation from arcade

Restrooms very nearby

Handicap accessible

Newspaper racks, nostalgic visuals

Optional classic pinball in contained area

Calm music appropriate to era

This is not a waiting room.

It is a social anchor that activates daytime traffic.

4. EASY STREET CAFÉ (Adults / Date Zone)

Separate from OPL.

Purpose: Captures the “after dinner dessert & coffee” habit that normally happens elsewhere.

Target: Adults roughly 25–55 Parents Couples Working adults

Not a restaurant. Not a bar. Not loud.

Offerings:

Coffee / espresso

Handheld pastries

Small desserts

Fair pricing (not exploitative)

Comfortable seating for 20–60 minute stays

Optional Features:

Slow-rotating screens

Light digital trivia

Short-session table games

Low-noise two-player games

This area encourages: Arrive early. Stay relaxed. Spend comfortably. Go to the movie without feeling rushed.

5. AMC CORE — MOVIES REMAIN CENTRAL

Movies remain the heart.

Enhancements:

Clear signage

Digital showtime alerts

App notifications when seating opens

Premium event auditorium (see below)

No reduction of movie priority.

6. EVENT / SHOWCASE AUDITORIUM

One designated auditorium per location (or rotating modular setup).

Used for:

Corporate presentations

Seminars

Reunions

Prom after-parties

Tournament finals

Watch parties

Community events

Motivational meetings

Private rentals

Daytime utilization = revenue recovery.

Corporate rentals: In-house concession packages required. Fair bundled pricing. No outside catering except specialty demos.

This turns idle daytime space into structured revenue.

7. GAMESTOP HUB — RIGHT AT ENTRY

GameStop remains GameStop — but expanded in role.

Functions:

Retail

Trade-ins

Collectibles

Trading cards

Tournaments

Event sign-ups

Power Pack pulls

Merchandise

Gift rescue zone

Dual Entry Model:

Interior campus entrance

Optional exterior public entrance

Can be closed off from campus when necessary

Gift Rescue Zone:

Small card rack

AMC / GameStop / Arcade gift cards

Quick gifts

Small balloons

Birthday emergency purchases

GameStop becomes integrated, not isolated.

(in case you forgot, or need a gift)

8. ARCADE — ZONED BY AGE & ENERGY

Not one loud room. Structured behavioral tiers.

Zone 1 — Kid Zone (Front Left Inside Arcade)

Bright yellow. Semi-enclosed. Visible. Parent seating outside.

Whack-a-mole style games. Simple skill games. Short sessions.

Safety prioritized. Containment prioritized. Revenue secondary.

Zone 2 — Preteen Transition

Near skee-ball area. Moderate lighting. Intermediate skill games. Natural visual separation.

Zone 3 — Teen Core Arcade

Darker lighting. High-energy games. Competitive machines. Skill-based machines. No little kids underfoot.

Zone 4 — Young Adult / Social Edge

Near Easy Street Café. Calmer. Two-player competitive games. Darts (if safe). Pinball (newer models). Social play.

9. MINI SNACK BAR (Inside Arcade)

Small. Strategic.

Pizza slices

Spill-resistant cups

Charging stations

Limited seating

Break area only

Encourages pause without forcing guests back to main lobby.

10. OPTIONAL CHILDCARE LAYER (Future / Location-Based)

Not standard. Not mandatory.

May be implemented per location.

If added:

Controlled access

Matching guardian tags

Short-duration stays

No infants

No diaper service

Monitored environment

Removes barrier for parents. Phased only if feasible.

11. PRICING PHILOSOPHY

People will pay.

They resent feeling trapped.

Adjustments:

Durable drinkware

Reusable containers

Fair-feeling concession pricing

Bundle packages

Experience-based spending

Instead of squeezing $25 from concessions, capture $15 in concessions

$20 in games

future visit.

Goodwill multiplies revenue.

12. FAMILY-FRIENDLY SAFETY POLICY

Layered. Visible. Non-intrusive.

Clear behavior expectations

Staff presence

Lighting control

Sightlines

Controlled child zones

Family-first environment standard.

Security without intimidation.

13. PHASED GROWTH MODEL

Phase 1: OPL Easy Street Café Core arcade zoning GameStop integration

Phase 2: Expanded events Additional games Brand merchandise Operational refinement

Phase 3: Large-scale attractions Exclusive branded games Major expansion after proof

14. END STATE

The AMC Theater Campus becomes:

A place seniors choose to visit.

A place parents feel supported.

A place teens feel energized.

A place adults feel comfortable.

A place families can attend together without conflict.

Movies remain central.

Nose: Much more neutral than the others, which isn't a bad thing. 8/10

Palate: You know what, it's not bad actually. Since the DMEM was probably as good as it gets and the DMEM/F12 was disgusting, I was prepared for the worst. Instead it was very smooth and subtle. Tasting notes include cardboard, autumn sea spray, empty office coffee mug that hasn't been washed properly. Most of that doesn't sound very appetizing, and honestly it wasn't, really, but I'm tasting culturing medium so I'm just gonna go with it. Besides I've seen people describe whisky notes as ""bandages"" and other insane things so I think it's just the way it's supposed to be. 7.5/10

Finish: Lightly salty after taste which disappears gradually but quickly. 9/10

Pairing suggestions: A walk on the beach on your day off, while you stress about your upcoming experiments

Price point: €27.18 from the catalogue, which makes it cheaper than DMEM/F12 while being way better. 8.5/10

Eight months ago I put $400 into Robinhood and told ChatGPT to trade for me.

The first trade doubled.

Then on the second day ChatGPT told me, “Uh… I can’t actually see live stock prices.”

Classic.

So instead of quitting, I did what any calm and normal person would do.

I spent eight months asking AI way too many questions until I accidentally built my own trading platform.

First, I built a giant Python script.

About 50 files.

It would:

	•	Pull all S&P 500 stocks

	•	Grab options data

	•	Build credit spreads

	•	Score them  
  
	•	Collect news

	•	Run the data through GPT



It took 15 minutes to run. It worked about 85% of the time.

People thought it was cool. But it felt like duct tape.

So I tore it down and rebuilt everything as a real web app.

Now here’s what it does — explained simply.

When I open one tab, it scans all 475 stocks in the S&P 500.

It checks important numbers like:

	•	IV (implied volatility — how wild traders think the stock might move)

	•	HV (historical volatility — how much it actually moved)

	•	IV Rank (is volatility high or low compared to the past year?)

	•	Earnings dates (big risk events)

	•	Liquidity (can you actually trade it easily?)



Then it runs “hard gates.”  Think of gates like filters. If a stock fails the filter, it’s out.

Examples:

	•	If the options are hard to trade → gone.

	•	If volatility isn’t high enough → gone.

	•	If earnings are too close → risky.

	•	If borrow rates are crazy → risky.

Out of 475 stocks, usually about 120 survive.  That means the filter actually filters.

Then it scores the survivors from 0–100.

Based on:

	•	Volatility edge

	•	Liquidity

	•	Earnings timing

	•	Sector balance

	•	Risk factors

It even penalizes if too many top picks are from the same sector.  No piling into just tech.

Now here’s where AI comes in.

I send the 120 passing stocks to Claude and GPT APIs (seeing which performs better).



But not to predict the future.  AI is not allowed to guess.

It only reads the numbers and explains patterns.

It writes things like:

	•	“89 stocks show declining historical volatility.”

	•	“Technology has 6 of the top 20, creating concentration risk.”

	•	“This stock has an 89-point IV-HV spread, possibly a data issue.”



Every sentence has numbers.  The math explained in simple English.

Then it picks the top 8 stocks automatically.

For each one, the app:

	•	Pulls live prices

	•	Pulls the full options chain

	•	Chooses a good expiration (30–45 days out)

	•	Calculates Greeks (Delta, Theta, Vega)

	•	Builds strategies like:

	•	Iron Condors

	•	Credit Spreads

	•	Straddles

	•	Strangles



Each strategy card shows:

	•	Max profit

	•	Max loss

	•	Probability of profit

	•	Breakeven prices

	•	A full P&L chart

	•	Warnings if spreads are wide



Then Claude explains the trade in plain English.

Example:

“You collect $1.15 today and risk $3.85 if the stock drops below $190. Theta earns about $1.14 per day from time decay. Probability of profit is 72%, meaning about 7 out of 10 times this expires worthless.”

Again — numbers only.



AI reads the math and translates it.  It does not decide.  I decide.

It also pulls:

	•	Recent news headlines

	•	Analyst ratings (Buy / Hold / Sell counts)

  
All automatically.  So in about 30 seconds:

475 stocks

→ 120 pass filters

→ Market risk summary

→ Top 8 analyzed

→ Strategies built

→ Greeks calculated

→ P&L charts drawn

→ News attached

→ Plain-English explanation



Zero clicks.  Cost: about 33 cents in AI usage per scan.

The edge isn’t fancy math.  Black-Scholes is standard math.  Greeks are standard.  Anyone can calculate them.

The edge is speed and structure.

Before I finish my coffee, I know:

	•	What volatility looks like across the entire S&P 500

	•	Which sectors are crowded

	•	Which stocks have earnings risk

	•	What the top setups look like

	•	What the numbers actually mean

Most retail platforms don’t do all of that automatically.

The tech stack (simple version):

	•	Website built with Next.js + TypeScript

	•	Live data from Tastytrade

	•	AI analysis from Claude and ChatGPT (in parallel) 

	•	News from Finnhub

	•	Hosted on Vercel



No Python anymore.  Everything runs in the browser.

This is not financial advice.  AI doesn’t control money.

It scans.  It filters.  It explains.

Humans decide.

That’s the whole lesson.

AI is powerful.

1r33xbe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r33xbe,OP went on a Mumbai Dwarka via Somnath bike trip (Latepost),"​ I went on a 1,820 km journey from Mumbai to Dwarka via Somnath back in November 2025. 

It was an intense experience for both me and my best friend.

​We left Mumbai at 2:00 AM on 11 Nov to reach the Surat Hazira Port by 8:30 AM to catch the 9:00 AM ferry. We rode nonstop until the Gujarat border, where we took a five-minute chai break because we were both shivering in the cold.

While the road to Dahanu was amazing thanks to the concrete, the 50–60 km stretch after entering Gujarat was pathetic. The road was riddled with potholes; since we were cruising at 80–90 km/h, we managed to skip over most of them.

​The moment I entered Surat, my speedometer broke and stopped displaying my speed entirely.

# ​The Ferry and the DIY Fix

​We reached Hazira Port just in time to board the ferry to Ghogha Port (near Bhavnagar). We slept through the crossing in our booked sleeper bunks, arriving at 1:30 PM. After riding 15 km out of Ghogha, we stopped for our first meal of the day.

​By then, my legs were already hurting due to my 6-foot height. I couldn't position my foot properly on the peg near the rear brake without causing accidental braking. In a moment of roadside ""jugaad,"" I pulled a random thread from my trousers and used it to rig a small platform on the footpeg, creating enough distance between the brake and my leg to ride comfortably.

# ​Darshans and the Long Road Home

​We reached Somnath at 8:30 PM, stayed overnight, and took Darshan the next morning. We immediately left for Dwarka, first visiting the Nageshwar Jyotirlinga before heading to the Dwarkadhish Temple. After Darshan, I sat by the sea and had a spiritual conversation with one of the Pujari ji of the temple. 

​The following morning, we visited Beyt Dwarka and the Rukmini Mata Mandir before starting the return journey to Mumbai. We originally planned to halt at Vadodara, but by 6:00 PM, we realized we wouldn’t make it. Instead, we stopped at a small place called Limbdi in the Surendranagar District, having crossed through Rajkot and Jamnagar.

​

# The final push. 

​As a history nerd, I insisted on visiting the Lothal ruins (the first Harappan Civilization site visit for me), which was 60 km from Limbdi. We left Lothal for Surat with the intention of staying overnight to rest. However, after dinner at 10:30 PM, we both felt a second wind and decided to push through to Mumbai.

​ We reached Ahura Hotel in Dahanu at 1:30 AM for coffee, bun maska, and some cookie shopping for the family. We finally pulled into my parking at 4:00 AM.

# ​Reflections on the Ride

​Overall, it was an amazing trip—the longest I’ve ever done. It was especially challenging being 6 feet tall with a pillion passenger (my friend doesn't know how to ride, so I handled all 1,820 km myself).

# ​We had some scary moments too :

​**Cattle**: Suddenly crossing the road without warning (Gujarat has just too many of them) 

​**Truckers**: Driving as if they owned the entire highway.

​**Night Blindness:** High-beam lights from the opposite lane were so blinding that I struggled to stay in my lane and had to switch constantly to maintain visibility.

Lirya let out a sigh of relief as Rhidi waved goodbye to her and Mohki, hopping back into a tarry-lift with her father and sister so that they could go talk to the court about their imprisoned mother.

The museum had been followed by a rather interesting lunch at another unit’s nearby DFAC, an experience that Kohan had really wanted to indulge in.

Lirya had found it rather stressful at first, but the warm smiles of the Human cooks and the soldiers around her brought her back into her own smiles and laughs in good time. There had been Kafya there, too, Rhidi calling them “Regs” and explaining that they were all part of another infantry Battalion.

They seemed nearly as shocked to see her and she was them, all of them tilting their heads at her and talking quietly to themselves. 

Like Rhidi, they all had bent ears, which after asking Rhidi about it, she had explained it came from their helmets.

“And don’t ask why they don’t make the ear sections longer,” Rhidi had said, pointing her fork at her after they had all sat down, “They will talk yours off about how much of a ‘tactical issue’ it is to have really tall ear ports on our helmets.”

When lunch was over and Kohan had viewed some of the barracks from the outside, they had to depart after receiving a message from the Fort Benning court system, marked “urgent”. Icirit was apparently becoming quite the nuisance to her jailers, and they wanted her out of there as soon as possible.

This left Lirya and Mohki on their own, Lirya waving goodbye to mostly Kohan and *Tyllia* rather than Rhidi, and Mohki standing there with her hands in her pockets.

“So.” Mohki began, nudging Lirya on the shoulder. “What do you want to do?”

Lirya looked up and around her, a stranger in a strange land, then looked back to Mohki. “Mall?”

“Mall sounds good.” Mohki replied with a grin, then looked around her at the busy road. “... How do we get there?”

Lirya wasn’t sure either, looking up and down the road for one of the odd little cars that Rhidi had showed up in. She wasn’t sure how to use her data-slate either, but inspiration did take her when she spied weirder looking vehicles coming down the road.

“Hey!” Lirya called out, pointing to the larger, angular vehicles that seemed to be missing their wheels. “We can go ask those Humans!”

Mohki snapped her head towards Lirya in time to see her go trotting off after an armored *convoy* of combat vehicles, their tracks rumbling and clattering down the road. 

Mohki startled, running off after Lirya. “Lirya! No no no! Lirya, those aren’t cars!”

“Sure they are, Humans drive them into battle and stuff!” Lirya called back over her shoulder, then waved up cheerfully at a rather confused driver, his helmeted head poking up over the rim of his hatch door opening. “Hey! Hiii! Can you guys give us a lift?”

“Lirya, those are combat vehicles!” Mohki shouted after her, snatching the white furred Kafya by her bandaged tail.

She had caught it in a hatch door earlier on Kohan’s ship, not used to navigating non-Human doors.

To Mohki’s horror, the tracked vehicles all rolled to a halt, the lead vehicle clattering to a slow stop beside Lirya as the crew all popped their heads up to see who the hell had flagged them down.

Unheard to Lirya, the crew were talking to themselves via their inner-helm microphones, and all she saw was the dozens of helmets popping up out of hatches to peer at her through dagger-shaped visors.

“Is that one of ours?”

“Nah, look, their ears are all straight.”

“Could be recruits.”

“Recruits wouldn’t look like that Murph, it’s work hours.”

“She certainly looks like a soldier, her ears are all ate up.”

“Ain’t ever seen a white one before, those are rare right?”

“What are you talking about? There’s that mean one that works over with the Droppers.”

“I’ve never seen her.”

“She was wanting a ride right?”

“She looks like she came from a firefight. If she’s a civilian then what’s with all the scars?”

The vehicle leader took off his helmet, his short shaved black hair, green eyes, and handsome jaw catching both Lirya and Mohki off guard. “You were wanting a ride?”

“Yes sir!” Lirya called out, placing her hands together and bowing forward at the waist. “We are going to the mall!”

Mohki placed a hand to her face, then slapped the back of her hand lightly to Lirya’s shoulder. “Oh my gawd, stop *bowing*.”

Inside the helmets, the soldiers were all laughing.

“*Sir*? Goodness, look at who got a field commission.”

“The mall? We can drop them off at the mall.”

“Come on Cap’, we can let ‘em ride on top of the lead vic’, would be a hoot.”

“If they’re tourists it would be a once in a lifetime opportunity too.”

“Lemon, grab your camera and get some shots of this, the Company news page is gonna love it.”

“Go on Kilpatrick, let them crawl up on your deck. We can swing by the mall I guess.”

Kilpatrick nodded, then gestured up at the two Kafya. “Alright you two, climb on up, we can drop you off at the mall.”

“No shit?” Mohki said flatly, her eyes wide while Lirya went giggling up to the truck, climbing up with the rustle of trousers much in the style of Mohki’s.

“Hiii!” Lirya cried out cutely as she came up the climbing rungs onto the top deck of the armored personnel carrier, waving to the other crew. “I’m Lirya!”

Kilpatrick chuckled as he lent a hand to Mohki, nodding towards his vehicle. “We’re Haybale, happy to have you aboard. Say hi fellas.”

First the crew waved, then the top passenger area of the armored personnel carrier split apart as the infantry inside wanted a look at their two passengers, a mess of helmets staring at them and hands waving.

“Get moving, Kilpatrick.” Came the voice of the convoy leader, and Kilpatrick nodded, slipping his helmet on and activating the mic. 

“Hang on ladies.” Kilpatrick called out, his voice slightly tinny with the external speaker. “There’s a bit of rocking when Haybale starts moving.”

Lirya, giggling and kicking her feet along the slant of the front armor, wobbled back and forth with Mohki as the APC began moving. The massive engine spat out a gout of black smoke, but slowly climbed to speed.

The two Kafya riding on the front of the APC gained quite a few eyes from other drivers on the road, while a few formations of marching soldiers couldn’t help but double take at Lirya and Mohki riding along on a war machine that was known to render steel to slag.

“Lirya!” Mohki called out over the roar of the engine and wind. “Do you have any idea what this is?!”

Lirya nodded, pointing down at the armor plating between her legs. “It’s a Human car!”

“Did you never learn about Human war vehicles!?” Mohki shouted, jabbing a thumb back at the large caliber autocannon. “Or do you think all Human cars have guns?”

Lirya shrugged, which made Mohki roll her eyes in annoyance.

Mohki scooted a bit on her rump so she was at an angle, then pointed back at the armored turret. “This is a Bradley M22 Hellknight, it’s a mainline infantry support vehicle! The ones behind us are AMPV sixes, and they hold ten infantrymen per vehicle!”

“Is that why they are so big?!” Lirya asked over the wind, looking back at the smooth topped APC’s, the guys in the turrets waving at them. “What are those little pod things?”

Mohki pointed to the one nearby on the M22 Hellknight they were riding on. “Those are anti-ordinance pods! They switch out between a little gatling gun or a laser, and shoot at rockets or stuff coming at the vehicle!”

“That’s pretty clever!” Lirya laughed out, then waved at the pod. “Hi pod!”

To the surprise of them both, the AI running the pod at the moment popped awake and deployed its camera, spinning it around to look at Lirya and Mohki.

To Lirya’s delight, it waved at them with the little wiper on the camera lense, then clicked back into its hidey hole within the pod.

“That’s Dirty Dog.” Kilpatrick called out, his voice loud thanks to his helmet, and he pointed to the pod. “He’s been with us since we first got the vehicle.”

“Do you like being in the big armored cars?” Lirya asked him, leaning backwards to look up at the helmeted Human.

Mohki, spotting the amount of cleavage she was offering, tugged her back forward.

“It’s pretty fun sometimes.” Kilpatrick said with a laugh to his voice, having seen more than enough for him to have something to talk about for the rest of the day. “Some days more than others.”

Inside his helmet, Kilpatrick rolled his eyes at the chatter.

“Man, he’s out there getting the best view on this heap!”

“The scars are kind of doing it for me, actually.”

“I’m more interested in the little goth one next to her, see if she’ll lean backwards for a question too, Kilpatrick!”

“You guys are being so gross, she’s obviously fresh from the station.”

“I kind of want to take her to the salon on base, let her have some fancy time!”

“We could always take her to that mani-pedi place down by the commissary, we’ll just have to go when the officer wives ain’t there.”

Kilpatrick shook his helmeted head back and forth as the convoy continued to trundle down the road, and after some time the mall began to loom into view. After a bit of chatter from the convoy leader, he leaned down towards them and pointed towards the mall.

“Your stop is coming up ladies. We’re going to pull out of the convoy and drop you off at the doors.” Kilpatrick said, then pointed to the side of the Haybale. “Just climb down those assault rungs and use the tracks as steps if you need to, it’s a little easier for going down.”

Lirya and Mohki flashed him the “okay” hand signal, something they had both learned from Humans on board the station.

The vehicle rumbled and clattered up past vehicles going to and from the mall until it parked right outside the walkway into the doors, allowing the two Kafya to disembark onto the concrete below.

“Bye bye!” Lirya cried out, waving with both hands to the vehicle as it took back off with a roar of the engine.

Both the crew and passengers waved back at her, with multiple troopers making “call me” signs with their thumb and pinky while others blew them kisses.

“Humans never change, man.” Mohki chuckled out, looking around as curious lookie-loo’s went back to their own business, or talked quietly to themselves about the odd taxi lift the two Kafya had received. “So this is the mall eh? Pretty big! Should find some cool stuff in here.”

Lirya snatched up Mohki’s hand as she let out a giggle, pulling Mohki towards the doors as the brown fur nagged at her for acting “too much like an excited child”.

Lirya didn’t make it too far inside before she spotted the miniature drop towers, just in time to see a laughing and cheering child get dropped from the hoop and sent gently drifting towards a great ball pit.

These false drops were facilitated via miniaturized drop towers, cranking a child up to the top on a pre-deployed parachute. At the top, a large hoop that held the chute would jangle and deploy the child, allowing them to drift down towards a large ball pit, giggling the entire way and screeching out “Airborne!” when they hit the colored spheres.

“Oooh!” Lirya breathed out, then pointed to the drop zone. “Mohki, we should do this!”

Mohki squinted her eyes at the height and weight requirements, then a wry grin split her lips. “Sorry girlie, but I may be too much woman for this ride. Looks like you may squeak by though.”

At the uttering of the words “you may squeak by”, Lirya went giggling off towards the mini jump towers.

The older Human man working the machines, his “Ur War Veteran” black ball cap worn by many days in the sun, turned and saw Lirya coming.

“My goodness, another one!” He called out with a laugh, holding up his hands. “Hold on there sister, what unit are you with?”

Lirya came to a stop before the man, tail wagging but blinking in confusion. “Unit?”

“Yeah, what unit are you training with?” He asked, pointing to the miniaturized unit patch on his hat. “We give you guys discounts, but we have to track what unit you’re with for our records.”

“She’s not in a unit, old timer.” Mohki called out cheerfully as she brought up the rear behind Lirya. “We’re here on vacation.”

The older man put his hands on his heavyset hips. “Vacation! Well how about that. The first of your kind I sent up on one of these was an odd little pink woman, but you may fit in the harness better than her I think.”

“I can go up?!” Lirya cried out happily, clapping her hands together with little stomps of her paw shoed feet.

The old man nodded. “Oh yeah, we ordered a slightly larger harness just for you space foxes, and you look pretty light.”

Lirya went happy-stepping after the man while Mohki leaned against a nearby pillar, watching as Lirya was fitting into the harness. Another nearby Human, a little younger than the worker but not by much, idled up next to Mohki.

“She’s not a veteran?” He asked.

Mohki shook her head. “Nope, just a civilian like me.”

“What the hell did she get into that spat her out like that, then?” The man asked, crossing his arms. “Looks like she came off nearly four years in the field.”

Mohki frowned at that, flicking her hair out of her eyes as she looked over at him. “She got those from people who should have never been her enemy in the first place.”

“Hmm.” The man hummed to himself, both he and Mohki slowly raising their chins as Lirya was slowly hoisted into the air.

“Mohki!” Lirya yelled out, kicking her feet happily. “Look how high up I am!”

Mohki waved at her, as well as the man standing beside her, and he turned his head to Mohki as Lirya was paused at the top.

“Hopefully she heals where it matters.” He said, turning to walk away. “Flesh is far easier to scar than the mind. Those wounds tend to keep bleeding…”

Mohki turned her head to watch him go, but the metallic “click-crack!” of the hoop letting go of Lirya’s chute took her attention back to her friend.

“Wooo!” Lirya giggled out, kicking her feet merrily as the Human children below laughed and cheered.

“You have to say airborne!” A younger girl called out, waving her hands at Lirya as she slowly floated down. “Say the words!”

Lirya perked up at that, her ears high as she clapped her padded palms together. “Oh! Right! Airboorrnnee!”

The words were cut off with a cackle as Lirya landed into the ball pit, the chute falling down around her like a shroud as she continued to laugh from under the high tech nylon and risers.

“What an absolute goober.” Mohki laughed under her breath.

Lirya’s head popped up from the ball pit like a hidden spider, looking around to the older Human man who ran the machine. “Can I go again?!”

He looked towards Mohki, who rolled her eyes and pulled out her funding-slate with a sigh normally reserved for parents.



—



After four drops on the ride, Lirya was satisfied and more than ready to expend the rest of her energy at the mall.

First thing she had to hit was the card store, a massive outlet that boasted enough game tables to host a large tournament. Refreshing her deck with some new packs, and buying Mohki a few boosters as a thanks, they then made their way to a tea shop.

While other races of the stars had been steeping leaves, roots, and other plant elements in water to form their own brews, no planet had honest, true to Terra, *tea*.

Growing in popularity along with many of the other cash crops, tea plants were starting to be found on planets controlled by the Humans, though the plant was oddly aggressive on naturally found plants native to the planets. This required farmers who grew tea plants to *fence off* their crops of tea so the local plants had a barrier from their advances.

Tea plants had, after all, been found to be strangling the roots of native flowers to succor their vitality.

Lirya had tried tea for the first time on Station First Horizon, and had found the herbal concoctions delicious. This store may as well have been a hub to her eyes, the walls filled with drawers bursting with loose and bagged tea.

The smell alone made Lirya close her eyes and breathe in deep, her bandaged tail wagging as she just soaked it in.

Mohki preferred coffee, primarily from an ice cold can dropped from a vending machine, and had to fight to not sneeze at the smell around her.

“Like walking into a gardening center…” Mohki muttered under her breath as Lirya went walking off into the store, sniffing and snuffling at the many drawers.

To Lirya’s most delight, there were dozens of warm pots that offered free samples, and Mohki had to wait behind her with a tapping foot as she tried every, *single*, one of them.

Acknowledging her bubbly appreciation, the workers of the tea shop doted on Lirya as if she were a VIP, brewing fresh samples of tea for her that were not *supposed* to be free samples in the first place.

From rooibos, hibiscus, to jasmine and warm chai, Lirya spent nearly an hour in the store chatting with the Human workers and exploring their many teapots. By the time they left, Lirya had multiple teapots, teas, and steepers being delivered to Kohan’s ship, as Mohki had no desire to haul along multiple iron teapots with matching cups.

To give Mohki a break, Lirya steered them both towards a store named “Love in Steel”, a store primarily catering to jewelry for piercings.

Here, Mohki was in her element, picking out a lot of jewelry she had not seen up on the station, including several new hoops, screw ornaments, and some new gems for her belly button.

Despite their best attempts, Lirya could not be lured in by Mohki, and the male Human who worked the shop, to the piercing chair, no matter how much the two told her that “she would look super cute with a naval piercing”.

One store that caught Lirya’s attention sold tiny, miniature trees, apparently called “bonzai”, and she spent a little bit of time leaning over and peering at the little, manicured trees.

To Mohki’s relief, Lirya did not bite at many of the deals offered to her on little red maple shrubs, or sweet plum trees.

A store they both found enjoyment in was a soap, bath bomb, and shampoo store that looked much like a back-alley market on a fringe world, complete with wooden crates, boxes, and salesfolk dressed in aprons.

Lirya kept threatening to flick glitter on Mohki, who just wanted to browse the bath bombs in peace, while the store workers were running the numbers in their minds on just what would *work* with their fur.

This culminated in both Lirya and Mohki turning into guinea pigs, their furred, pawed hands and cheek fur being used to test soaps, shampoos, conditioners, and oils to see what would work best. 

Mohki found the whole thing rather annoying, while Lirya was basking in the *glory* of it all, her fur smelling like flowers and soft to the touch.

The store gave Lirya small gifts and extras after the amount of money she spent there, the bags being delivered via AI delivery drones to Kohan’s ship.

Lirya was still running her padded fingers through her fur, smiling to herself with indulgent eyes.

“Have you ever felt this *soft*?” Lirya asked Mohki, humming happily to herself as her tail wagged behind her. “It’s like I’m actually clean.”

Mohki, still trying to smooth down her downy-soft fur, twisted her lips. “We came out of that store smelling like expensive hookers.”

“Expensive hookers must smell amazing every *day*.” Lirya said softly, wrapping her arms around herself to better smell the fragrances.

Mohki raised a brow at that, then flicked Lirya on her ear. “Yeah, let’s not start planning our professional future on that particular avenue, eh?”

Lirya just giggled, rubbing at her ear while still smelling at her hands.

A rather unfortunate find was a store that primarily sold ooze and slime, a sensory toy for Humans and anyone else with smooth skin.

Lirya’s over eagerness to play in the slime caused a moment of panic when it dawned on a worker *who* was playing with their product.

The awe turned into horror as Lirya found the slime stuck to her fur in awful ways, and it was only the quick thinking of Mohki that kept Lirya from getting it any further than her wrists.

The soap store employees were surprised to see Lirya again, but the sight of her in panicked tears and rapid sobs sent them into a frenzy.

Mohki, arms crossed and once again gaining the air of a tired parent, got a front row seat to nearly *six* Human workers doing their best to scrub, pluck, comb, and brush Lirya’s fur clean. The task took nearly an hour to finish, but Mohki had found a small coffee shop in the mall that sold ice cold canned coffee to pass the time with.

Mohki noticed with a smile that Lirya had the odd ability to make people *worry* over her, likely due to her innocent nature and infectious personality. Lirya always had the air about her of a favored niece, an innocence that was honest due to her lowly upbringing.

Once she was clean, refreshed, and soft once again, Lirya spent a long moment tearfully hugging and thanking the staff of the soap store.

When Lirya and Mohki walked back past the ooze and slime store, a new sign read “Kafya, please do not play with slime”.

“Little late there, dick.” Mohki muttered, while Lirya took the *long* way around the store, giving it a wide berth.

The sounds of steel on steel brought their attention to a store that was not really a *store*, but a club set into a store space. Within the club, Humans wore odd looking helmets and uniforms, fighting each other with long, thin blades that were blunted at the tip.

Fascinated, both Lirya and Mohki watched the Humans trade blows for a few minutes before journeying on, then coming across the largest Hot Topic that either of them had ever seen.

“Oh *hell* yes!” Mohki squealed out, taking Lirya by the hand and dragging her inside. “This thing is huge!”

Lirya let out a short cry of aggravation as she was dragged inside, as she had been eyeing a different store that seemed to specialize in casual European fits based off of historical clothing. 

“We have this store up on the station!” Lirya grumbled, but resigned herself to the many noises that were coming from Mohki as she looked around at the many broody and gothic wares.

Unlike the store up on station, this Hot Topic was currently going through a series of “Odes to the 2000s”, including resurrecting a ton of merch from bands of the era and earlier.

Mohki held up one shirt in particular, her tail lashing back and forth as she held it up before Lirya. “Do you know who this is?!”

Lirya squinted at the shirt, which appeared to be two white masks, one laughing and one crying, while the words “Theatre of Pain” were scrolled along the bottom.

“Is it from some kind of… play?” Lirya asked, looking around the shirt at Mohki.

Mohki scoffed, slapping the shirt against her thighs before holding it up again. “It’s Mötley Crüe! You’ve listened to them, right? Home Sweet Home? Wild Side? Smokin’ in the Boys Room?!”

“Uh…” Lirya said as she stared blankly at Mohki, her finger tips starting to fidget. “I’ve listened to Yuri… and Tophamhat?”

Mohki’s face seemed to crumple. “Aw man, Lirya, that’s… *weeb* music.”

“I like it though.” Lirya replied shyly, then stamped her foot. “It’s cute, and it’s happy!”

Mohki rolled her eyes. “Have you even tried listening to actual music? Iron Maiden? Judas Priest? Poison? Slip Knot? Tell me you’ve at least listened to *Korn*…”

“Ew, no.” Lirya said with a twisted face, throwing an emotional dagger through Mohki’s heart. “Those bands just sound like a bunch of noise and screaming.”",5,1770926759.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

So I'm relatively new to Godot, I've finished one platformer game, and made a few practice games. I'm using this cafe game to improve my coding skills independently, without tutorials, and I couldn't seem to find one for this specific problem anyway!

So the trouble I'm having right now is this:  
I've used a timer for my customer (I'm wanting to do several different customers of different avatars but I'm unsure how to do that right now, I may need to do a group? I practiced z arrays a bit in a dress up game), and I've used this timer to stop my customer from moving after the timer runs out at 2 seconds, so they'll stop at the counter. I'm coding them, asking for their order (which will be different for each avatar; this is a practice game, and I need to randomize it). The order needs to pop up (order is a label) after the timer runs out. I have the label as invisible, but I'm unsure how to code this in my main game node.

This is the code for my customer so far:

extends Node2D

@\\onready var sprite\_2d: Sprite2D = $Sprite2D



const SPEED = 100.0

var direction = 1.0



\# Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.

func \_ready() -> void:

	pass # Replace with function body.



\# Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame.

	

func \_process(delta: float) -> void:

	position.x += direction \* SPEED \* delta



func \_on\_timer\_timeout() -> void:

	direction\*= 0

Elias woke up minutes before the alarm. It wasn't the sound that woke him, but the feeling that the room wasn't in its right place. He sat on the edge of the bed. He looked at the door. Then at the window. He needed an extra second to convince himself that everything was still. He reached toward his wrist, and stopped before touching it. He let his hand drop.

In the hallway, the sound of intermittent footsteps passed. A door closing. A short laugh from Oliver, cut off suddenly, then returning with a lighter tone.

He went down to the breakfast hall. Professor Miller was there before everyone. A cup of coffee in front of him, and his phone lying flat on the table. On the screen, a photo taken at sunset. The inscriptions. He was zooming in with two fingers, panning slowly, then returning it to its original size. He stopped at a specific part. It didn't look different from the rest, and yet... he kept staring at it longer than necessary. Then, when Elias sat down, Professor Miller turned off the screen, and slipped the phone back into his pocket without lifting his head.

The others arrived one by one. Mia with eyes half-closed. Sophie busy with her phone. Mark talking about the road and the return trip, as if the journey were completely over. Everything returned to its usual rhythm... or so it seemed.

The waiter passed near the table, and the light flickered for a moment. Not a full outage, but a quick dimming, like the blink of an eye. The light returned immediately. Oliver continued talking without stopping. Mark didn't look up. Sophie didn't notice at all. Layla stopped eating. She raised her eyes to the ceiling, then returned them to her plate.

Elias felt a coldness pass through his chest, as if the air had changed its weight. He didn't say anything.

They left the motel after breakfast. The air was colder than Elias expected. Not the morning chill, but a sudden coldness, as if it were passing through him, not around him. In the small lot in front of the entrance, a car was parked along the curb. The engine was running. And no one was inside.

Elias stopped unconsciously. It wasn't curiosity, but the feeling that the scene was missing one step. He approached. With every step, he felt like his body was half a second ahead of him, as if the movement happened, and then he decided on it. He reached for the car door—the engine died. He hadn't touched anything. He stepped back. The sound returned suddenly, louder than before.

Mark said from behind, raising his eyebrows, “Strange... battery must be tired.”

Elias didn't reply. Layla was near him. She looked at his raised hand, then at his face. She didn't ask.

On the way to the city, small things began to go wrong. The radio jumped stations without anyone touching it. The phone lost signal, then regained it in the exact same spot. Mark's digital watch stopped at a time that didn't match anything around them.

Oliver said, smiling a half-smile, “Clearly, technology doesn't like field trips.” No one laughed.

Elias felt the pressure return. Not pain this time, but a heaviness behind the eyes, as if something was trying to cross over, then pulling back. He closed his eyes. He saw the road, but without cars. Without sounds. Without movement. Like a scene where life had been temporarily forgotten. He opened his eyes quickly. Sweat had dampened his neck.

Mark said as he slowed down, “As soon as we arrive, we need to rest. Clearly, the fatigue is getting to all of us.”

They reached the city before noon. The noise returned. The voices, the people, the movement. Elias got out of the car, and felt for a moment that his feet didn't touch the ground at the same instant. He looked around. Everything was in its place. And yet, one thing was clear now: It wasn't him who had crossed time. Time had left its mark on him.

Elias said nothing as he walked behind them. The noise around him was dense, but it seemed distant, as if a thin layer of air separated him from everything. At the first intersection, the traffic light stayed red longer than it should have. Cars behind them started honking. Oliver stuck his head out the window slightly, waved an apology, then pulled it back, muttering something inaudible. When the light turned green, the cars took off all at once, as if time had been held breath for a moment, then suddenly released.

Elias felt the pressure return. Not in his head this time, but in his chest. He took a deep breath, then another. It didn't help.

On a side street, they passed a small shop. Its glass front reflected their images for a moment. Elias stopped unintentionally. He looked at the reflection. It was him... but the movement didn't perfectly match what he felt. He blinked, and turned away.

Mark said from the front, “We're already late, we don't want to get stuck here.”

They continued walking. In the elevator leading to the upper floor of the building they were entering, they gathered in silence. The doors closed slowly. When someone pressed the button, the elevator didn't move immediately. One second. Two seconds. Then it started rising suddenly, faster than anyone expected.

Oliver grabbed the handrail and laughed, “Clearly, today is full of surprises.” His laugh came out shorter than usual.

Upon arrival, the doors opened with a slight force, as if the elevator hadn't calculated the distance precisely. They stepped out. Elias was the last. He felt the floor tilt slightly, or maybe it was he who tilted. He reached for the wall, stopped before touching it, then dropped his hand to his side.

Layla was watching him from a distance. She didn't come closer. She didn't say anything.

In that moment, Elias understood just one thing, without words, without explanation: What happened in the desert wasn't a fleeting moment. And it wasn't something they could leave behind like sand on their shoes. It was with him. In his steps. In his timing. In the empty spaces between things.

And no matter how hard he tried to act like everything was normal, there was one thing that was no longer the same: The feeling that the present is stable... but it doesn't resemble what it was.

I’ve been seeing this girl since October. We had been friends for about a year before that — she had been a supporter of my band and always encouraged my music. After Canadian Thanksgiving, we finally went out for coffee.

The first date went well. When I tried to kiss her, she stopped me and said she was “dating to marry” and didn’t want intimacy unless she saw long-term potential. She’s the daughter of a Baptist pastor and takes her faith seriously. I respected that. But within two days, things escalated quickly. We became intimate, and within two weeks she was telling me she loved me and could see herself marrying me.

We became inseparable. We texted daily, FaceTime multiple times a week, saw each other at least once a week, and she told people I was her boyfriend even though we never officially defined it.

In early November, her mood suddenly shifted. It was drastic. That’s when she told me she has Bipolar I. I told her I wanted to understand and support her. After a short dip, things stabilized and were good for several months.

Around Christmas, she said the holidays depress her because of family dysfunction. Her mood dropped again. After New Year’s, she told me her father had found out about us and didn’t approve because I’m not Protestant. She said she understood his concerns and wasn’t sure it could work — but she was crying, saying she loved me and didn’t want to stop seeing me. That contradiction hurt.

At first, nothing immediately changed. We still saw each other and were intimate. In person, she was affectionate and loving. But during the following week, her texting dropped significantly. She would leave me on delivered while active on social media, but still like my stories or send memes.

After a few days of distance, she told me she’d been diagnosed with depression and didn’t have the energy to talk to anyone. That same night, we met up for coffee and ended up being intimate again. This pattern became confusing: distance over text, warmth in person.

A week later, I told her I missed how things used to be. She responded, “I get that a lot,” and emotionally shut down. Soon after, she ghosted me for several days while posting on Instagram and going out.

In early February, I randomly ran into her at a record store. She acted normal, said she was stressed and mentally exhausted. I asked if she was seeing someone else. She laughed and said she didn’t have time. We went back to her place and were intimate again.

Since then, things have been “mostly normal,” but not like before. She FaceTime's me at night, sometimes for hours. But during the day she barely texts. I can be left on delivered for 6–8 hours while she’s active online. When I try to make plans, she says “maybe” or cancels last minute, yet still sees friends.

There’s also an 18-year-old coworker she’s become close with. She’s spending hundreds of dollars on concert tickets with him and says she feels like his older sister because he comes from an abusive home. She insists there’s nothing romantic there.

It’s been about a month of this inconsistent behavior:

* Distant over text
* Active on social media
* Avoidant about plans
* Still affectionate in person
* Still FaceTiming regularly or reaching out periodically as if nothing happened

I don’t know what to make of it.

Is this bipolar cycling? Depression? Stress from family and religion?  
Or is she slowly losing interest but keeping me emotionally attached?

I’m confused by how someone can seem avoidant yet still stay physically and emotionally connected at the same time.

# TL;DR

Started dating a girl in October after a year of friendship. Things moved extremely fast — love, talk of marriage, strong attachment. She later revealed she has Bipolar I and struggles with depression, especially around holidays and family stress (including a disapproving pastor father).

Since January, she’s been inconsistent: distant over text, active on social media, cancels plans, but still FaceTime's and is affectionate in person. Mixed signals for about a month.

Trying to understand whether this is bipolar/depression or if she’s gradually losing interest.

I came up with a simple Google Maps routine that helps avoid sketchy areas, save on Uber, and actually enjoy walking around.​

1. Switch to “Explore” and zoom out. Look for clusters of cafés, bakeries, gyms, and pharmacies. One or two venues are random; dense clusters usually mean real, everyday life.​
2. Use the 7–9 am coffee test. Search “coffee” and read reviews or photos from early morning. Busy cafés at 8 am are a strong signal of residential, lived-in neighborhoods rather than nightlife zones.​
3. Check the *route*, not just “10 minutes.” Tap “Directions → Walking” and inspect the path. Long, dark stretches, underpasses, or isolated sections can be red flags even if the walk time looks short. Multiple route options are a green flag.​
4. Scan 1-star hotel reviews nearby. Ignore room complaints and focus on mentions of “unsafe,” “noisy street,” “scams outside,” or “sketchy area.” Location complaints often reveal what the map doesn’t.​
5. Use Street View like it’s night-time. Drop into Street View and imagine arriving alone in the evening. Streetlights, open shops, and foot traffic are positive signals; shutters down and empty streets are not.​

You’ve seen the videos: the grainy filter, the slow pan over a family dinner, the old men playing dominoes in white plastic chairs, the caption reading ""THIS is culture."" It looks beautiful. It feels nostalgic. But there is a silent tragedy happening behind the lens.

The moment we frame a tradition to ""show it off,"" we have fundamentally altered it. We have taken a living, breathing ritual, one that used to exist only for the people in the room, and converted it into Social Capital. We aren't just sharing a moment; we are feeding the algorithm the raw data of our souls so it can sell a ""vibe"" back to us.

Jacques Ellul warned us that Technique would eventually move from our factories into our private lives. He was right. We have turned our heritages into ""cores"" and ""aesthetics.""

\-Culture is a way of being.

\-Content is a product for consumption.

When we commodify our upbringing for the For You Page, we flatten the texture of our lives. The algorithm doesn’t care about the weight of your grandfather’s stories or the specific smell of the coffee; it only cares that the ""aesthetic"" generates a 10% higher retention rate.

We are watching the ""washing out"" of humanity in real-time. We are trading the messy, slow, unpolished reality of community for a high-definition simulation of it. We are becoming a society that knows how to look like we belong, while we sit increasingly alone, heads buried in phones, watching videos of people pretending to be together.

The only way to save a culture is to let it be invisible again.

Real culture is inefficient. It is slow. It is often boring. It doesn't have a soundtrack, and it certainly doesn't have a ""share"" button. If you want to find the ""real thing,"" you have to put the camera away.

1r33ghc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r33ghc,"What is going on here with my teeth/gums? Dentist keeps telling me they don't see anything concerning, but something feels wrong.","I've been feeling incredibly frustrated and anxious over these teeth specifically. I've tried to go to the dentists but everytime I have gone, I've essentially been told nothings wrong with my mouth and to keep doing what I'm doing, but it feels like something is clearly wrong and I have felt like I am going crazy. really sorry for how long this is. I'll have a TLDR at the bottom, I just feel the context is important. Also sorry for any formatting or spelling errors, I am on mobile. I have attached a picture of the problem side first and the other side for comparison. 

some medical context: I wasn't taken to the dentist between ages 13-21 due to my family not being able to afford it. I didn't floss at the time but did always brush twice a day and used mouthwash. At the time I was a kid and didn't think of it cause I had no pain but decided at 21 to go to make sure everything was ok and to take care of my health because I finally had money of my own. they told me I had 1 cavity that needed to be filled, which I did, as well as 3 teeth that were progressing towards cavities that they said didn't need to be filled but likely would in the next few years. I also had gingivitis, they did a scaling, gave me medicated mouthwash and toothpaste and sent me on my way. I have had regular 6 month check ups since and now I brush twice a day, floss once a day, and use mouthwash usually ones for gum health specifically. I was using a manual toothbrush fir the last few years but switched over to an electric a month ago. 

I'm a 24 F, I don't smoke at all, and I drink very sparingly. I am a big coffee drinker which is why I have some staining. About a year ago I noticed part of my gums is more sensitive that the rest of them. not necessarily painful or even uncomfortable, it was incredibly slight but it just felt different when I would run my tongue over it. When I looked it, it looked like the gums on these teeth were a bit receded which made me very anxious so I went to my dentist a bit later because I had a cleaning scheduled already. they told me I still had some kinda deep pockets but nothing too concerning. All they said was that my partially erupted wisdom teeth and molars had some build up and to make sure to focus on getting them when brushing and to keep flossing. They recommended an electric tooth brush and told me I should get my wisdom teeth out when I can. I wasn't able to afford either at the time but just tried to be really diligent with my brushing and flossing. my next 6 momth check up said the same thing. 

In November I noticed some pain in my mouth and went in for an impromptu appointment to see what was wrong. They told me I needed to get my wisdom teeth out, that my gingivitis had come back, I need 3 cavities filled. I figured these complications were due to my wisdom teeth because they had been partially erupted for years and while I tried my best to focus on them, parts of them were under gums. They said I didn't need a scaling, did a cleaning, and a few days later filled my cavities. Since I had recently gotten insurance, I got my wisdom teeth out a couple weeks later as well. At the appointment and filling I told them I was worried about recession and that I am really scared of getting periodontis because it's irreversible. They told ne that I had a little recession but likely due to brushing too hard, they said an electric tooth brush would help me brush less hard and to get one after I recovered from my wisdom tooth surgery. 

I had my most recent cleaning early January. I had continuously remained anxious over these teeth specifically cause they seemed the most receded especially compared to the other side of my teeth, the sensitivity was still there, they looked more yellow that the other side no matter what I did. At my cleaning I was told I no longer had gingivitis and had actually reversed my 3mm gum pockets to 2mm and they said I had been healing from surgery a bit slowly but well. I said I was concerned about peridontis and my gingivitis coming back, they told me I could be more prone to it due to genetics and gave me some rx toothpaste for prevention and I also got an electric toothbrush finally. I specifically asked about my recession and sensitivity again, and they said that I did indeed have recession, said it was minor and not concerning and likely due to brushing hard, once again and that the sensitivity may just be from that or healing from surgery. They told me my X rays are fine too and so I left. I had always felt like this dentist always went through my questions and concerns rather quickly and didnt always feel like looked at my teeth the most throughly, it always felt quick, but they are the professional so I just trusted that. I figured if something was wrong, they'd catch it. 

Despite all the changes, I still felt the sensitivity and the recession still worried me. I couldn't really tell if they were getting worse visually but it just felt like something was wrong. And then I started to notice a bit of blood after brushing even though I knew I was brushing lightly with the electric toothbrush. I decided to take another look again and I was comparing this side with the other side of my upper teeth. I noticed a little dark colored line or gap, super tiny, right at my gum line. I picked it a bit with my fingernail and it had a scraping sensation on my nail, as it it were chipped or something. It felt like I was able to get under the gum a bit, and it started to bleed. One of the other teeth did this as well. I tried to do this same picking at the other side of my teeth and it did not feel the same and did not bleed. I didn't feel the scraping or anything. 

Something is clearly wrong and I have felt incredibly frustrated and defeated. I want to do right by my teeth and my health, I want them to be healthy. I have tried my hardest to have a good oral health routine. I have been trying to figure out whats wrong with these teeth for months, trying to ask the dentist who would just tell me it was fine every time. I started to feel like I was a bit crazy and maybe just having health anxiety. But they are bleeding and I clearly feel something wrong. I am terrified of periodontis and gum recession in general. 

I'm going to find a new dentist and see if they can take a more thorough look and help me. I just want to know if anyone has any idea exactly whats going on or what treatment I might need? Or any advice in general. 

TLDR: 3 of my upper teeth look receded to me, more yellow, and are more sensitive. I recently noticed a dark line/gap right at my gum line on 2 of these teeth, and when I ran my fingernail over it, I got a scraping sensation and it bled. It does not do this on the other side. Feeling super anxious about what it could be. Have continuously been told by dentist that they didn't notice this issue so I feel kinda crazy. Help? ",1,1770925769.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

And the other being why do I attract a certain type of woman. 

I never really paid attention to this. But I know that guys tend to pay attention to what type of women paid attention to them the most. Its kinda like the question how do you know if your ugly? I honestly never really cared about my looks. However, I dont want to be the guy who goes after highly sought after women and stay single either. 

For example, my type is women that favor olivia rodrigo( I have said this before) lol. However, I am not going to cut off any women that doesnt favor her. Ironically, alot of asian women respond pretty well to me. Idk why especially if they are chinese. For reference, I am black but on dating apps and irl there are always asian women that flirt with me. 

Lastly, in my life I have attracted a bunch of boarderline insane types as well. When i hear men talk about how they met a woman who is down to earth and somehow lets them use their car, I am dumbfounded. 

Alot of women who end up chasing me, tend to blow up my phone, threaten me or stock me. For example, in college I liked this one girl who rejected me. I moved on. She watched me from a coffee shop and told me that I watched you ever morning btw but I dont like you. She kept tabs on me for 2 yrs straight. 

I offered to take a girl to a bar in my grad school once. She freaked out after I went to the bathroom for 10 minutes. She was waiting out in the hallway saying she was scared that I would leave her. We were still in school lol. Last one, I met a girl who literally got pregnant my another guy and tried to get me to date her. Of course, I said no but she hid the pregnancy and tried being friends with me. 

I only found out because she posted on her facebook.

Can you guys please tell me the best place to get Taiwanese style popcorn chicken!! I have tried a few places and some are better than others but if you guys have any recommendations, it would be much appreciated 😊 I have included a small list of the places I’ve been to below!

**The Teahouse Tapioca and Tea- 8/10** 

This place is pretty good depending on the location you go to and their yucca fries make the trip worth it for me. My favorite location would be the one on 34th street! I don’t know why but the food tastes better at that location. It used to be a good value for what you get but they recently changed their packaging and now they give you less and upped the price😢

**Long Coffee- 7/10**

This place is pretty good, but not as crispy I would say. But they give a lot of chicken for the price they charge.

**Tasteas- 6/10**

This place has good flavor but DEFINITELY overpriced. The regular size is about $8 if I recall and it’s not that much and they have a large for $12 (I think?) but it doesn’t seem worth it. Not sure if they didn’t load up the last time I went. 

**The Bep- 3/10**

The popcorn chicken didn’t really have much of a flavor and it was very tough/not meaty. they did give a decent amount of chicken but I couldn’t finish it due to the taste.",5,1770925389.0,HoustonFood,6,1.0,False

1r339ve,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMindSpace/comments/1r339ve/the_psychology_of_changing_your_life_so_fast_it/,The Psychology of Changing Your Life So Fast It Feels Illegal,"I spent way too long thinking change had to be slow and painful. Like, years of therapy, decades of grinding, maybe by 40 I'd have my shit together. Then I got obsessed with neuroplasticity research and realized we've been lied to. Your brain can rewire in weeks, not years. I'm talking actual structural changes that show up on fMRI scans.

The problem isn't that change is hard. It's that most advice is garbage. We're told to ""think positive"" and ""set goals"" when the real issue is we're running on autopilot 95% of the day. Your subconscious is basically a drunk driver and you're letting it steer. But here's what actually works, backed by neuroscience, behavioral psychology, and people who've actually done this.

**Stop trying to build discipline, start building systems.** This comes straight from James Clear's research in Atomic Habits. The book won multiple awards and Clear spent years studying how Olympic coaches and Navy SEALs actually create lasting change. His main point destroys the willpower myth. You don't need more discipline, you need to make good choices automatic. Want to read more? Put the book on your pillow every morning. Want to exercise? Sleep in your gym clothes. Sounds stupid but it bypasses the part of your brain that negotiates. I started doing this and went from ""I'll go to the gym later"" (translation: never) to just going because the friction disappeared. This book will make you question everything you think you know about habits. Insanely good read.

**Use implementation intentions instead of vague goals.** Research from psychologist Peter Gollwitzer shows that people who use ""if-then"" planning are 2-3x more likely to follow through. Don't say ""I'll eat healthier."" Say ""If it's 1pm, then I eat the salad I prepped."" Your brain loves specific cues. It's like programming yourself. I do this for everything now, even social stuff. ""If someone asks how I'm doing, then I'll actually tell them instead of saying 'fine'."" Sounds mechanical but it works because you're not relying on motivation, which is basically emotional weather.

**The Ash app changed how I process emotions, no joke.** It's an AI mental health coach that actually gets it. Not some corporate wellness BS. You text it when you're spiraling and it helps you identify cognitive distortions in real time. Like when you're convinced everyone hates you, it'll point out you're mind-reading. The CBT techniques are legit, based on decades of clinical research. After using it for a few weeks I started catching my own thought patterns before they wrecked my whole day. Game changer for anyone who overthinks everything.

**Do the smallest possible version of anything you're avoiding.** BJ Fogg's research at Stanford proved that tiny behaviors create momentum better than big commitments. His book Tiny Habits breaks down exactly why. Can't start the essay? Open the document and type your name. Can't work out? Do one pushup. The activation energy required is so low your brain can't build up resistance. And once you start, you usually keep going because humans hate leaving things unfinished. This is how I finally stopped procrastinating on everything. Just make the first step laughably easy.

**The Huberman Lab podcast will teach you more about your brain than four years of university.** Andrew Huberman is a Stanford neuroscience professor who explains complex research in plain English. His episodes on dopamine regulation completely changed how I approach motivation. Turns out constantly chasing little dopamine hits from your phone makes you incapable of doing hard things. He explains the actual mechanisms, not just ""put your phone away."" Once you understand why your brain does what it does, you can actually work with it instead of against it.

If you want to go deeper but don't have time to read through dozens of books and research papers, BeFreed is worth checking out. It's a personalized learning app that pulls from books, expert talks, and behavioral science research to create custom audio podcasts based on what you actually want to improve. Type in something like ""I procrastinate everything and want to build better systems"" and it generates a structured learning plan with episodes you can adjust from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives. The depth control is clutch when you want more examples and context. Plus you get a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with anytime to ask questions or get book recommendations. Makes the whole self-improvement thing way more digestible when you're commuting or at the gym.

**Stack new habits onto existing ones.** This is called habit stacking and it's stupid effective. After I brush my teeth, I do 10 pushups. After I make coffee, I write three sentences in my journal. You're using established neural pathways as anchors for new behaviors. Your brain already has a strong association with the first action, so the second one gets pulled along. Way easier than trying to remember to do something random at 3pm.

**Use Finch for building consistency without shame.** It's a self care app with a little bird that grows as you complete tasks. Sounds childish but the gamification actually works because it gives immediate positive feedback. Most habit trackers just make you feel like shit when you miss a day. Finch celebrates small wins and doesn't guilt trip you. Plus the daily check-ins help you notice patterns in your mood and energy.

**The two-minute rule is legitimately life changing.** If something takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. Reply to that text, wash that dish, send that email. This is from David Allen's Getting Things Done methodology. Every tiny task you put off becomes mental clutter. Your brain keeps track of all that unfinished stuff in the background, draining your energy. Clear them out instantly and you'll feel way less overwhelmed. Started doing this and my anxiety dropped noticeably within days.

Change doesn't have to take forever. Your brain is designed to adapt. The people who transform their lives quickly aren't special, they just understand how neuroplasticity actually works and use it. Stop waiting for motivation. Stop thinking you need to suffer for years. Just start manipulating your environment and your autopilot will follow.",2,1770925352.0,TheMindSpace,0,1.0,False

Enjoy this item list, let me know if there is anything I should critique at all. For the general items section you get one discount per point bracket. Let me know if you would add anything else or if you think something is a bit too overpowered

General

Pocket money (Free)

No matter what you have pocket money, around 10000 yen to start off! Refills hourly but this never goes over 10000 yen

A roof over your head (100 FP)

This is something everyone needs a place to stay, if you are a student then you have at least a room paid for you. This isn't a luxurious option but it does at least give you a fairly decent and furnished studio apartment. Always good to have a place to call home, and for the Hitman, Third Rate of All Trades and Mafia Heir Origins you have the option to buy this multiple times as safe houses!

Quality coffee/ tea set! (100 FP)

This is an amazing tea or coffee set with a special addition, while it comes with everything an upscale tea house but the real pleasure comes from the magic of the brew, in a literal sense, as you can use your various powers in relation to this equipment to influence how the brew comes out. Sky flames feel like home and hearth, Storm is rich and addicting, Rain flames are calming and relaxing, Sun flames give energy and vitality, Lightning makes all flavors come out stronger, Cloud allows you to make flavors linger, and mist allows you to add emotion from your own experience to the brew. Not only that, do you know healing magic? Well brews with this set can now have a watered down version of the ability. The stronger the ability the better the effect but you have to have said ability first.

Mundane Material (100 FP)

This is a good item for the crafty, you have 100 pounds each of cotton, wool, oil, varnish, paint, and nails. As well as 500 pounds each of wood, ropes, and glass, and 1000 lbs of stone, mortar, metal, concrete and all the tools to use this whenever you want. Not that unless you use it, this does not carry over to the next day. If you want to build something huge it will take a while to build anything. Why is it long enough to go to Antarctica and build an igloo for penguins! Each purchase of this doubles it from the last time. Lets hope you have the skill to use it!

Flame Proof Wardrobe (200 FP)

You know what sucks? When your clothes spontaneously combust. I liked those shorts too, but hey now you have an entire wardrobe of fire proof clothing. From formal wear to some casual clothes, even uniforms for school or work. Have fun picking the pieces, but you only have 12 outfits total that are fully flame proof

Shirou’s Prototype Ring (200 FP)

“Why do you have a ring made of bottle caps? You stole it from a teenage wizard living in a shack? What do you mean its matched to your elemental affinity?” This is an extremely low quality ring, but it is matched to a single flame type you have. It increases your efficiency in your flame type and allows you to cast low powered flame attacks with 8% more efficiency and 10% more power with attacks conceptually linked to your flame.

Supernatural material (200 FP)

This is a direct upgrade of mundane material where now its the same material but every piece has a single unifying concept you decide. When making material based on this concept receive a “grade up” from before. If your skills are enough to make a B rank item out of mundane material then you can expect at least an A rank piece.

Combat Club Uniform (400 FP)

“HEY YOU! JOIN MY COMBAT CLUB!” A random kid told you once. Handed you a uniform and the preferred safety equipment and ran off asking the next person. This set is for one of 4 options, but you can only gain one: 
- Boxing Uniform and Gloves: You gain a 40% boost to learning Boxing, and can now push your perks or powers into your fist more easily
- Kyudo Uniform and Bow: You gain a 40% boost to learning traditional Japanese Archery and can now put close combat powers within arrows
- Kendo Uniform and Boken: You gain a 40% boost to learning traditional Kendo and can now flow close combat techniques over your swords and swordsmanship
- Martial Arts Uniform and Ring: You gain a 40% boost to learning traditional Japanese empty handed martial arts and a combat ring where you can enforce a one on one confrontation

Magical Disguise: 400 FP

Where did he go? Well he has a magical disguise that lets him seem like a mundane person of that profession for the setting you are in. You can purchase multiple but please not the smarter or more powerful a person the less likely they will be fooled. You can change the disguise once per setting

Shard of a meteor: 400 FP

This is a meteor with conceptual weight, inside of this meteor comes one concept of your choice that it is aligned to. Whatever concept that is, you can make a mystic code around. This meteor is up to you on it being metallic or non metallic, happy crafting!

Box of Weapons: 600 FP

Now what is a box weapon? Well its an animal, a weapon and a box… yeah okay let me explain. A box weapon needs a flame type ring to activate, and only reaches a full potential when a person with a flame type and ring type match up. The more energy of the corresponding type pushed into the Box Weapon the Stronger it is. And look at that, you can pick the animal and the flame type this box is, make sure you can use it or its just gonna be a paper weight. But if you have everything? You now have a companion or weapon that is either your equal in combat or doubles your combat potential while you have energy.

Broken Bifrost: 600 FP

The shattered and broken pieces of the bridge of the gods. In terms of crafting material and general use this is some of the most conceptually powerful you can have. Any construct you make is truly amazing.

Shroud of a true Saint: 600 FP

It could be a normal cloak in anyone else's hands but for you this is a noble phantasm with one of three uses. A shroud blocking you from paranormal sight, a seal against corruption and evil, or a shield against unholy power. Conceptually this cloak is an A rank phantasm but you experience mental bleed of the user the linger you have to use it. This thing is also self repairing so its gonna last you a while!

Drop In: 


Formal ID 100 FP

This isn't just any ID: passport, drivers license (or learners permit), family genealogy, and more. You have an observable background now! You can still be sketchy and be fully alone but now you actually have stuff to go with that

Mundane Disguise Set 200 FP

Now don’t be alarmed, you have a non mind controlling disguise. But you have a lot of it. You have costumes and make up in the truck load allowing you to have an outfit for every situation. While everything is decent quality this is more a giant closet in your warehouse with one of every costume you can think of, as long as people don't look too closely you can probably convince them of you being someone else. Watch out for any magical or paranormal tracking though, something tells me they don't make a concealer for that. Unfortunately the outfits take a full jump to repair themselves but the make up and wigs are repairing at the end of day!

Premade Gaies 400 FP 

Just sign on the dotted line! This is a premade magical contract that you just have to fill out the details for. You get a new blank Gaies at the beginning of the week if you used one the previous week. These contracts are binding based on the power of the strongest signer. Be careful with this, it isn't easy to break a contract that grows in power just as fast as you do.

Formula Craft Book 600 FP

This is a basic book on formula craft, the basics of the basics if you please. This is a beginners guide to making your own spell, weirdly tailored towards your Element and Origin. There aren't any actual spells in here but there are a lot of notes and research on the topic in formula craft in how it relates to you…

Hitman

Burners Burn Out 100 FP

You have a very special phone for a variety of reasons. For starters it can't be tracked, hacked, stolen or used against you in any way. Secondly it naturally changes model to be whatever model of phone you want once per year. Choose wisely as this is the safest and most protective phone around!

Ring of the Guardian 200 FP

This ring is a special device, because it strengthens based on two factors. It starts at the level of one of Shirou’s Prototype Rings, fairly basic but useable but the stronger the bonds you have, and the stronger the rings in the bond the stronger this ring will be. If you are not within a Sky or the rings within the sky are somehow lower quality it will take a while before it grows at all, but it will keep growing.

Paper Trails Trial 400 FP

Jumper why do you have over 30 ID’s and passports? Wait, what do you mean you have an accent for each one? Well this is a set of ID’s and Passports for every country in the world. You are considered a citizen here in this country, but while using an ID you get three pieces of knowledge. You gain a near flawless accent for whatever region of the country that your ID says you are from. A basic knowledge of statistics of your country, how big, units of measure, the basics. Finally three fun facts on your ‘place of origin’. Overall combined with Mundane Disguise Set unless the investigation has a psychic or a strong magic user you are in the clear. Works in future jumps

Fire Away! 600 FP

This is a gun, but a special one! You have the Dying Will Flame Bullets within a 6 shot revolver. They have two special properties. For the first part don't shoot people in the head, if you don't take my advice don't be surprised if they start having all their secrets spilled. The second ability is that if you have these bullets fired into someone 6 times within a day without them truly injuring themselves you can activate the flames of civilians who might have been too weak otherwise. With this you can also unlock flames of people outside this jump as well! But you only get 6 bullets every month, and again need 6 shots in a day without damage? While people have hysteric strength and going after their desire? Good Luck!

Mafia Hier

Deeper Pockets 100 FP

Well you still have 10000 of something in your pockets daily, but as an heir to a mafia family you do a lot of your education and time within European borders. As such this is now 10000 Euro or equivalent (when KHR took place the conversion was 1 Euro per 147 yen)

Non sick shtick 200 FP

It is sad but there are families within the underworld that would happily subject their kids to torture and illness for a half chance at bragging. With this option you won't have to! Pick one mundane art per purchase of this Item and receive a lucky charm that makes your talent and growth rate in the mundane art be prodigious. Note that it has to be one of the arts!

Familia Headquarters 400 FP

This is a funny little thing, you have your families familiar hq, inside of this gigantic lavish and splendid mansion is at least 40 flame active hitmen who have access to the Hitman Freebies, 50 flame active servants and 10 different flame type weapons. Each one of the flame active people under your command has a low tier and quality ring. Should you purchase ""Alliance Headliner” instead you may be the heir to a family that is cannon in either KHR or Storm of Swords! Good luck wrangling a bunch of people whose power comes from emotion. Your Familia will follow you into new worlds but they will only ever have two power systems, their flames and the world they are currently in.

Kiss the Ring: 600 FP

This is your family's ring, designed by someone who knew what they were doing as its equal to the Vongola Rings. This single ring matches your primary flame type and makes all techniques related to your flame or its attributes 1/10th the price, 300% stronger and much easier to control than it is with anything else. The reason why? This ring is based on your soul itself. The base upgrades? Is the start. This ring evolves with use as you use it, and should you have other magical foci eventually they will have a multiplicative effect as well. Fair warning though, the more foci you have the harder it is to learn until you get to that point

Civilian

Mundane Food Set: 100 FP

This is fairly simple, a fully stocked kitchen and pantry filled with food native to the region you are in and that match your tastes. Inside this kitchen your learning speed for cooking all things experience a massive boost! Show that red haired ass that you are the real master of the kitchen

School House Rock: 200 FP

This isn't an instrument per say, but it is a copy of each of your text books and club equipment charmed to make you learn 5 times faster. Only just picked up an instrument for a club a couple months ago? It sounds like you've been playing for a year. Struggling a bit in math? Well a couple hours a day feels like you have been practicing all day every day with how much you improve. Note that you only have the equipment while inside of the curriculum of an educational institute and their clubs. You keep the skill but still…

A house and home 400/600 FP

Inside of this house is 4 bedroom, 3 bathroom, swimming pool in the back, two story home. This is even better as your apparently did the Emiya’s a big favor back in the day so its warded against a large chunk of supernatural craziness. For an additional 200 FP you have a full family compound with 6 of the original houses worth of rooms and amenities within the gated community. Instead of extra pools there is a game room, an onsen, a meditation garden, a dojo and an at home movie theater. Even better the wards improved to be seen as a ""neutral space”, unless you get into politics and mafia bs at max you would have reborn as to use your kitchen

Nanamori Town 600 FP

Ah… you are bringing this town with you? This town… okay? This is a town where the underworld goes to retire. You have family and friends here and evidently a lot of skin in the game. In terms of what you own, pick 3 mundane shopfronts and they have the same protection as the 600 FP option of House and Home and belong to your family. This town will appear either in japan or a place appropriate for it in your jumps. Good luck?

Third rate at everything

Basic Workshop 100 FP

This is nothing more than a fancy tool shed, sure it is a place where its easier for you to experiment and use your magic, sure its a space that you learn magic faster the longer you are inside. But I see literally just tools and some crafting equipment here, how is this magical?

Runic Alphabet 200 FP

This is a primer for basic runes. Is this helpful past making a bunch of equipment more durable and easier to maintain? Minorly. In all fairness its a beginner book with practical explanations and a bit of room to grow, you are not gonna be throwing out primordial runes any time soon but if you already have know how in how these magic words work it functions as a continuation of education on them or the beginning of another languages rune system if a master of one already

Emiya Estate: 400 FP

this massive Japanese mansion has all the amenities included in a normal home. 10 bedrooms, an extra large Onsen, several bathrooms, a fully upgraded and expanded kitchen, even a large and spacious yard! Oh and don't forget the weapons closet, tactical bunker and the wards you would need a nuke to blast your way through. Inside of this mansion you are one of the safest people in the country, enjoy!

Avalon: 600 FP

The dream of Utopia, the shield of man kinds hopes and dreams. This is an EX rank noble phantasm capable of healing, blocking or hiding anything from anything besides conceptual death. You somehow got added as a tertiary wielder unless of pendragon blood, meaning you may use its power up to the B rank. Also you will look 20 at 200 from a slowed aging but who cares?

Magical Girl!

Magical Storage Necklace!: (100 FP)

This is a magical necklace of some kind, with an adorable animal mascot on the front. You have a necklace that can be used to store an entire wardrobe full of outfits that you can switch between, including accessories. Any magic outfits within your Necklace has the possibility of evolving if in a life or death battle. Have fun with your mid battle transformation sequence.

Magical Girl Uniform!!: (200 FP)

This is a dress of your own design that functions as a magical girl uniform, it takes the shape of a big fancy dress you want, or a suit I am not judging. This outfit is bullet proof, tear resistant, gives a base C rank magic resistance, fire proof to anything below an archibello fire, and is guaranteed to provide modesty for what Shirou believe would be appropriate. Aka it has bike shorts under skirts and is breathable enough there is no reason not to be in full gear. Finally you can use your flame type as a way to add additional armor.

Magical Weapon!!!: (400 FP)

This is a close range weapon of your design that is matched to your flame type, this weapon self repairs and has the chance to evolve whenever your outfit does, this is a melee weapon by default but you can buy this option multiple times. Only the first purchase is discounted.

Rainbow Wand!!!!: (600 FP)

*BOOM* Sorry about that, its your wands max setting. This thing is an absolute beast, made out of the fragments of the bifrost and set with several techniques from around the world to improve the manufacturing. This wand is a monster. Thankfully it has limitations, you only have access to what it can control at the time, unless your life is on the line. For reference at max power if you used enough fire magic to make something the equivalent to a lit match? You just fired a ball of destruction able to topple buildings or crater small hills. To unlock more power and reach these crazy depths you need to practice with your magic, control and more. If you have perfect control while using this? You might be able to destroy city blocks at once. Good luck world, your gonna need it with this thing existing.

After the newborn phase, most of what people read as “glow” is just sleep, hydration, and a few simple care rituals done consistently.

Keep skincare basic and breastfeeding-safe: gentle cleanser, moisturizer, SPF, and one brightening step like vitamin C. Anything complicated won’t stick right now. Hair and nails do a lot of heavy lifting too; a quick blowout, claw clip, or home manicure can make you feel human even in leggings.

Weight loss while breastfeeding is unpredictable. Many don’t see changes until weaning, so aim to nourish and hydrate rather than restrict. Walk daily, get daylight, and take vitamin D if needed. It helps mood, skin, and energy more than most products.

Build “micro breaks.” Shower while baby is in a safe seat nearby. Trade off on-call time with your partner so you can leave the house alone, even for coffee. That mental reset shows on your face more than makeup ever will.

[Machine and/or basket],"I’m pretty new to the whole home espresso world and just switched from a capsule machine to a De’Longhi Dedica Duo.

Up until now, I’ve never had any issues with caffeine. I usually drink flat whites in cafés (sometimes even 2 a day), no jitters, no anxiety, nothing. I even bought the same pre-ground coffee from the café I usually go to, so I’m technically using the exact same beans.

At home I’m using:

* De’Longhi Dedica Duo
* 14g coffee
* Pressurized basket (that’s all I have for now)
* Brewing a double and making a flat white with it

But the weird thing is: the caffeine hit feels WAY stronger. Like uncomfortably strong. I get jittery, overstimulated, nauseous – which literally never happened to me in cafés.

Going with a single shot is not enough to pull a strong taste for the flat white.

The taste is okay (not amazing yet, but drinkable), so I’m a bit confused why the effect feels so different.

People don’t want your tool. They want what the tool enables.

 You do X -> so Y happens (Y = the superpower)

* Bad: “We provide a content system.”
* Good: “Turn LinkedIn posts into inbound leads without spending Sundays writing.”  



**2. Pick an expensive problem**

  
If the problem isn’t intense and frequent, nobody replies.

Anchor to: lost revenue, wasted spend, missed pipeline, risk, churn, hiring pain, time drain, missed deadlines <- just don't use this alone, without context



**3. Personalization isn’t “buddy-buddy.” It’s “why you.”**



Personalization must justify why this person got this email.

* Good: “Saw you’re hiring 3 SDRs - teams hit routing bottlenecks at that stage.”
* Bad: “Go Lions! Loved your post!”  



**4. Use the prospect’s words (delete jargon)**



If they wouldn’t say it over coffee, delete it.

Replace:

* “optimize” → “stop losing”
* “streamline” → “cut time”
* “leverage” → “use”  



**5. Cut BS like your life depends on it**



Mandatory 4-pass edit:

* Pass 1: Delete fillers (“just,” “wanted to,” “checking in,” “excited to,” “hope you’re well”)
* Pass 2: shorten sentences + remove extra claims 
* Pass 3: write as a 6th grader
* Pass 4: fit in 60-80 words



**6. Be meaningfully different**



Prospects already have a way to do the job.  
Include one differentiator they can repeat.

Examples:

* “We do it without hiring.”
* “We do it without changing your stack.”
* “We do it in 10 minutes/week, not 3 hours.” 



**7. Poke the bear (cost of inaction)**



Use a question that makes doing nothing feel expensive.

Good questions:

* “How are you preventing X right now?”
* “What happens if X stays the same next quarter?”



**8. Slow down the CTA (lower friction)**



Email #1 is an interest check, not a meeting request.

Good:

* “Worth a quick back-and-forth?”
* “Want me to send the breakdown?”
* “Open to a couple of details?”  



**9. Be “crispy” (specific = believable)**



Every email needs at least one movie detail:

* number, 
* timeframe, 
* named scenario, 
* constraint, 
* example, 
* metric, 
* mechanism  



**10. The magic of “without”**



The result without the thing that sucks is a top-tier hook.

Examples:

* “Book more qualified demos without adding headcount.”  
* “Reduce no-shows without ripping up your process.”  



**11. Detach and end on a high note**



No neediness. No guilt. No “bumping this.”

Sound calm. Be okay with “no.”

Preface :  61F and 55F from the US. Fairly active. Likes to treat ourselves. 

None of the ATMs worked for me. I came with $400USD and had to change money in a cambio in Pana on Santander. 

If people are Mayan, they will identify as so instead of Guatemalan. 

A good knowledge of Spanish is recommended. Friend said the Guatemalans are very nice and forgiving of her Spanish vs Mexicans (who told her to stop butchering their language) though I thought her Spanish is really good and was able to communicate and have meaningful conversations with people. 

There are tourist prices vs national prices for almost everything. Food is generally cheaper than in US in restaurants along the tourist strip but still expensive for locals. 

DON'T EAT THE LETTUCE. I WARNED YOU RIGHT NOW.  YMMV 

Early February is shoulder season. Weather is cool in the morning and at night. 50's F at morning /night and 75-80 F during the day. It was not crowded anywhere and sometimes we were the only people on tours. Perfect. 

Guatemalans are among the most civil drivers anywhere (maybe script tuk tuk drivers). Hardly any honking!

To Tikal 

GC to Flores - departures and arrivals are in different buildings.  go outside turn right to 1st cross walk and go across the street to departures and check in. 

In Flores was picked up by Hotel Tikal shuttle. Staff could not be any nicer. Hotel is basic but clean. Weather was uncharacteristically cold. There is no heat anywhere. One night I slept in my long underwear and socks. Wore my puffy jacket both days. Food was basic. Food was better at Jaguar inn. They had pepian, the national dish, Chaya (?) a creamy dish flavored with allspice which you can find the trees in the jungle. 

Sunrise Tikal tour with Marlon and Gem Tours. He is an excellent guide and with the money. He will go out of his way and try to find you birds you are looking for. Sunrise was cloudy but fun to hear the howlers wake up while you're walking in the dark. Also went on a Sunset tour thru the hotel. Guide wasn't as good tho he was really good at finding monkeys and told me about the place to look for hummingbirds in the morning. He was spot on cause the birders were there too. Tikal is amazing and you should go out of your way to see as much as you can. 

Took a shuttle to Flores Island. It is small and people weren't kidding that you could walk around it in 15 minutes. The most outer street is flooded in parts and has been for a couple of years. Took a cooking class with Pepian and made guacamole, pepian and tortillas. It was super fun. Stayed at casa Amelia which was clean and basic with a nice terrace and restaurant. 

Flight back to GC then to Antigua via car from hotel. Stayed at the San Rafael which is one of the nicest places I've ever stayed at. It's a beautiful colonial residence restored into hotel rooms. Rooms are beautifully decorated, big and had a great courtyard and sitting space outside your rooms. Plus it's around the corner from the Arch and central to everything. 

Antigua is a beautiful UNESCO city. As such it has these horrible cobblestone streets and tiny sidewalks. Wear hard soled shoes but it's Extremely walkable. The ruined churches are worth seeing as is MUNAG the art museum. The view from the top of La Merced Church is outstanding. Took 2 tours - a bike tour with CA Travelers which went to La Azotea coffee plantation, the market where we tried a tostada and local sweet candy and a small store where they make different drinks. It was fun but a little unnerving in rush hour traffic in these bikes with super fat tires. The other tour we took was a Chicken Bus tour with Columbus Travel. We went to a weaving coop, cocoa processing factory and macadamia nut farm. Shout out to Once Once, a vegan restaurant that we went to 3 nights just cause Guatemalan food is so heavy and El Comolote a restaurant by where they make tortillas with heirloom corn. Also check out Mundo Natural, a spa where the local ladies go for sauna and massages. They have good organic food as well. 

Took a very expensive Uber to Pana. I know this could be done cheaper but...we are not those people.   We stayed south of Pana along Playa Jucanya in Villas Jucanya. Really great villa, very well appointed kitchen and comfortable. The manager was extremely helpful and they had kayaks we could use. Also a tuk tuk driver we used to take us places. 

Boat prices were generally 25Q. It was 50Q to Santiago and mainly because it was slow they had us pay ahead for guaranteed launch (we ended up the only people going that morning). If you need a transfer you'll need to negotiate a transfer price. Usually 25Q but we heard someone get quoted for 35Q cause...foreigner. 

We visited Santiago and San Juan on day 1. Santiago is fascinating if you like history. We booked a walk with Dolores who is a legend in those parts. She's a Mayan elder and medicine woman, lived thru the civil war and can tell you stories. San Juan is really charming with all the colorfully decorated streets. We went to the Stingless Bee exhibit and went up the Mirador for some awesome views. 

We felt like we walked around so many markets already that we skipped Chichi. Instead we went to the Nature Reserve. Great little hikes with many suspension bridges, a butterfly house and nice restaurant. There is zip lining and something that looks like bicycle lining but we didn't do that. Also a hike to a nice quiet beach. BTW the beaches here are not sandy but rocky. Ended the day exploring the market in Pana and had drinks at hotel Don Rodrigo with a great view. They also have an interesting museum with Mayan relics from an underwater explorations. 

Next day we went to Santa Caterina Polopo (weaving and colorful village) and San Antonio Polopo where they make all the colorful ceramics you see around. The tuk tuk driver should have charged us 30Q a piece to SC but he charged 50Q. We think he was mad that we didn't hire him the entire day to do a tour but be wanted to be flexible. Anyways he showed us 3 Mirador points along the way. SC is indeed very colorful. We walked along the street where the school was as there were many stalls with women weaving there. There is also a coop where they sell things the children's parents make to sell to benefit the school. 

Had good coffee from Cafe Tuk a cafe run by a very nice family with a small coffee farm. 

Took another tuk tuk to SA (50Q) to San Antonio Polopo and visited 3 stores. Nice selection and fair prices. If you're short on time you could probably just buy stuff in the stores in Antigua and Pana. Prices are just a tiny bit cheaper (70Q for a mug vs 75Q elsewhere). 

Tuktuk back to Pana was 75Q for both of us. Uber didn't work here. Lol 

As for food we liked the Thai place Dao (really fair prices. Their drinks were inexpensive vs other places),  Circus Bar for pizza and Las Chinitas for Asian Fusion. As for the latter it was recommended by travelers we just met. The food was delicious. However DON'T HAVE THE SUMMER ROLLS if you aren't used to Guate water!  We were so careful and were just caught up in having veggies (these were raw) and we ended up a slight food poisoning. 

It wasn't the worst food poisoning I've ever gotten traveling but bad enough that we couldn't go to Casa del Mundo the next day. Apparently we were the last people they accepted reservations from - they no longer have day passes for people not staying there and using their facilities for the day. So that was a bummer. But glad we could convalesce  at the house. 

We left Pana via a private van that took us to GC but stopped at Iximche ruins along the way. Don't believe drivers when they give you a time, they will always be late. It took a little over 2 hours to get to Iximche and another 2 to get to GC. Iximche was really cool. It cost 5Q to enter and you have to hire a guide to take you around. We ended up with a guy named Alex who was fantastic. His English was excellent and is also Mayan and really affluent the time explaining the ruins to us. If we meet him earlier in the trip I would have tried to hire him for other things.  

Stayed at the Barcelo near the airport. It reminds me of the Marriott circa 1990. Clean and comfy with tons of amenities  (pool, spa, sauna, restaurant, shops). Mostly a business hotel with meeting rooms. You can literally spend your entire day decompressing there and never leave. But we did walk 15 min to a place called Saul for dinner. Beautiful courtyard restaurant popular with locals.

1r32k20,https://v.redd.it/94w6mv1h54jg1,First anaerobic natural this morning. My brain is still buffering.,"Sorry, I had to put my phone down to finish the shot. 15in 41out in 25s. Clarity was great but I think I'm going to shorten the yield and increase the grind/time to try to find more banana.

---

I've been on a single origin deep dive since getting a DF54 for Christmas, and this morning I pulled my first anaerobic natural, the Guava Banana from Colombia (from Hyperion in Ypsilanti, Michigan). I am still processing what happened in that cup.

For context, I'm running a Crossland CC1 espresso machine with a Normcore 58mm to 49mm step-down basket (thanks Lance for that rabbit hole). I switched to the step-down after fighting channeling and sour/bitter shots at 58mm. Initially I was getting a lot of donut extraction on the step-down with denser coffees at 19g. Dropped to 15g doses and things got way more forgiving. Still putting in reps learning to dial in and figuring out what I'm actually tasting, but I'm getting there.

Before this I'd been pulling an Ethiopia Ardi and a Costa Rica Black Honey Reposado (La Cumbre). Both were eye opening in their own ways, the Reposado had this frosted mini wheats sweetness with green grape and pear that I loved. Each one has been so wildly different from the last that I'm kind of kicking myself for not exploring single origins sooner.

But the anaerobic natural? Different planet. The tasting notes say lychee, guava, pink lemonade, tart cherry. I'll be honest, I don't even know what lychee or guava taste like, and I was too distracted by whatever was happening in my mouth to pick out the lemonade or cherry. All I can say is it was intensely boozy and fermented in a way I genuinely didn't know coffee could be. Not bad, just... I didn't have a reference point for it. My brain kept trying to file it under ""coffee"" and failing.

I'm hooked. What was your first anaerobic natural experience like? Did it click right away or did it take a few shots to figure out what you were tasting?",6,1770923735.0,espresso,10,0.8,False
1r32jr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1r32jr4/i_get_rid_of_my_familys_things_regularly_without/,I get rid of my family's things regularly without them knowing.,"I know it sounds bad, rude, inconsiderate, but hear me out. 

My husband had a rough childhood. His dad was schizophrenic and his mom is...well...not smart. Half his childhood was spent shuffling from apartment to apartment, the other half he was just full on houseless, on couches or with other family. His 16th year was spent not just houseless but on the streets, homeless. The way we met was because he was friends with my older brother, who had an old 1990s conversion van that he allowed my future husband to sleep in. My mom wouldn't let him in the house. Why was he homeless? Because his dad lost his apartment, again, and was living in an unheated garage crazy out of his mind. His mom? She was living with a boyfriend who simply didn't want her son there. He wasn't a degenerate, he was unfortunate. 

Anyway, eventually my husband found a job with a man who had an HVAC business and an apartment building. The man was nice enough to let my husband unofficially rent an apartment for half pay. So picture it, a 17 year old boy with his own apartment but only enough money per day to buy himself a few dollar menu items. No furniture. He used his dirty shirts as a towel for after showers and skipped meals to buy soap and TP. He slept on a pile of his clean clothes and made ramen noodles and hot dogs with a coffee pot. I didn't know him well back then, but looking at him, you never knew what he was living like. He didn't talk about it until years later when we got together. 

In the meantime, his mother was bouncing from boyfriend to boyfriend with a few stints of homelessness in between. Despite being a full grown adult in her 40s with a stable job, she could never keep an apartment. Her whole life, she has lived with family, a friend or a boyfriend. If she had no one, she had no home. There was a very few short years where she had custody of all 3 of her kids, one being disabled, and was able to afford a place with that one child's disability check and child support, but she lost custody of that disabled child. The reason she lost custody, according to her, is due to lies and harassments from that childs father. My husband says she had a hard time keeping food in the house and they all had truancy issues at school, especially the disabled child. I have a suspicion that drugs was the reason for the neglect, although I can't prove it. My husband once mentioned that during his time as a homeless teen, it was a particularly cold winter day and the only place he could go at night to sleep was the neighborhood trap house. The lady that ran the trap house felt bad for him and let him sleep on the couch. My husband recalls sleeping on the couch and his mom walking in from outside in the middle of the night, waking him up. She was surprised to see him. He recalls the interaction with her was awkward and brief. She claimed to not know his dad lost his place and that my husband was homeless. She promised to find a place for them and left. What was she doing at a trap house? My husband refuses to believe she was there to buy drugs, claiming to just be ""friends"" with the lady that ran the place. I know better, you,  Reader, know better, but it doesn't matter now.  I digress...

He never heard from his mother about having a place. He worked. When he was 18 he and his cousin joined the army together, but my husband was discharged during basic training because he had undiagnosed asthma. He went back to working for the man with the apartment, got his GED without any prerequisite classes, passed his first try, and then it was all uphill from there. His first grown up job was at Comcast, installing internet and cable boxes. His second job that payed a little more was at a security company installing cameras. His third job that paid a little better was at AT&T. He got laid off and had a stint of unemployment and thats how met again. He was unemployed and bored. My brother, still living at home, had lost his license due to DUIs and needed rides to work, my husband gave those rides for extra gas money. He'd drive my brother home and my mom would welcome him in, unaware that he was that skinny homeless kid she refused to allow in the house, and offer him whatever she made for dinner. We reconnected and the rest is history. I moved into his apartment a year later, we had a baby and bought a house in 2019. That same year, his mother fell on some ice leaving work and broke some segments in her spine, her tailbone, arm wrist and thumb. Due to medical negligence, nothing healed right and she became disabled. Her boyfriend kicked her out and she needed a place to stay so we let her move in. 

This house has been the longest living situation my husband and his mother have ever lived in. 7 years. Its not long but its long to them. Because of all this history and dysfunction, both of them have become quite the pack rats, and no wonder. They never have had to declutter, as an abundance of stuff has never been a problem. My mother in law came with very little for a 52 year old woman. A bed, some knick knacks and a few storage containters of odds and ends. Over the years, she lost a lot of things, including pictures of her own children, pictures of her parents, basically no sentimental items came with her at all. The few pictures she has of my husband and sister in law as babies came from  her brother or my husbands dads side of the family. She didn't even have picture of her dead parents. 

My husband had already had a big collection of things before moving here from the apartment, but now that we have a garage and basement, it has gotten way way out of hand. The garage is full, and I'm constantly fighting the hoard in the basement. As for my mother in law, she didn't come with much, but she wants to claim everything my kids touch. Every drawing, every report card, every school art project and every toy and clothing item. She has one reason or another to keep these things and wants to store them. The key word here is WANTS to store them. She doesn't end up storing them, instead, she piles them up in a corner somewhere with the intention to find the right container and never finds the right container. So on my kitchen table , computer desk, corners of my kids room or living room, theres piles of things she intends to keep. I've tried having a conversation with her, I've tried helping her find a place to put these things in her room where my management is not needed, it doesn't work. Her closet is full to the ceiling. She wants ME to find a place and keep these things. ""get a bin, get a folder, get a filing cabinet"" she says. But i don't WANT THEM. 

And lets not forget my husband, who buys new stuff but refuses to throw away the old. He can fix it, and if he can't fix it, he can take use the parts in it to fix something else. He's very intelligent and tech oriented. Every job he has ever had, he was under qualified for but excelled anyway. Heck, he's an engineer with no college degree, sometimes making double the money other guys at his job make with their degrees. I understand he CAN fix these things, or use the parts, but SHOULD he? No. We have the money where he doesn't have to do that, and he certainly doesn't have the time. There are some weeks where I don't even see him until Friday night because of how many hours he works. He doesn't HAVE to hoard anything for the sake of needing it later, yet here we are. We have a basement and garage full of rusty old tools, computer parts, toys that I deem too damaged, broken or dirty to give away and old dressers he collects from the alley as storage solutions to these items. 

I've tried putting my foot down and just getting rid of some of my husbands things. These are things that I saw as obvious garbage. Broken toys, old papers, things with his FOOT PRINT on them because all he does is step on them, and he picked them back out of the trash! it caused the BIGGEST argument where I thought he was going to leave me. Thats when I realized that he won't get rid of these things not because he's lazy, he has trauma from moving so much as a kid and being forced to leave stuff behind so often. He's in therapy and getting better about getting rid of things, but the damage is done, and its a very slow recovery process. 

My mother in law? she's a lost cause. There's no reasoning with her. Over the years she has gifted my children many things. Many, many things. From dollar store items to expensive clothing, my kids are honestly spoiled with stuff. Anyone who has kids knows that kids grow and change. They stop playing with baby toys and move on to toddler toys, then they move on to ""big kid"" toys, and then they are done with toys forever. No kid keeps the same toys their whole childhood. My mother in law seems to think that we can buy an unlimited amount of toys and store them forever. Especially the stuff that she buys. Same with clothing. It doesn't matter if my kids grew out of them, get a container and keep it forever. Don't donate or give any of it away, ever.  When she sees me making room for the next size up, she'll take whatever clothes she bought out and make a pile. I've tried not saying anything and just ""disappearing"" the pile, but she knows i wanted to get rid of it and will raise hell if she finds it missing. Thats ""her"" stuff. Her stuff that she won't keep in her room or store. 

So this is how I get rid of things so we don't end up on an episode of Hoarders. 

When my husband is at work, and my mother in law is out for the day and my toddler is sleeping, I get a black garbage bag that we use for the kitchen trash and fill it up. I go around to all the piles and put it all in the bag. Everything, my husbands scrap wires, my 8 year olds school papers and drawings, McDonald's toys that my mother in INSISTS will be worth money one day, clothes my kids have grown out of a cheap dollar store toys that my toddler only uses as a projectile, my mother in laws clothes that she decided she doesn't want but must be stored, and I put it in the basement. When everyone comes home to an emptier living space, theres questions. Wheres this? where's that? ""in the basement"" i tell them. This way, if they really needed it, IT IS in the basement and I can bring it back. But if a season goes by (for example, if I put something in a bag downstairs in winter and its still there by spring) I drive the bag to my mothers house and we dispose of the disposables and donate the donatables. Why do I drive it to my moms house? Because if they see a bag anywhere, even if that bag is in the dumpster, they'll open it and pick stuff out. One time I threw away a dollhouse that was chewed up by the dog. My mother in law picked it out of the trash and just left it in the garage. It sat for MONTHS. She didn't touch it, didn't tell me what she did or why..Just decided we're keeping it. So I drove to my moms house and put it in her trash. 

See, they don't want these things. They want to KEEP these things. There is no use to these items other than ""what if I need it or regret getting rid of it?"" 

So I know it sounds harsh, and it feels like stealing, but this is MY house and I refuse to live like a hoarder. 

My husband is getting better, but he still ends up leaving junk everywhere sometimes. My mother in law is a lost cause. Like a child, she wants to hang onto everything with to logic behind it. My opinion is that if she wants to live that way, she can get her own place and fill it to the top. Until then, stuff is going to the ""basement"" (trash).",3,1770923716.0,confessions,3,0.8,False

I’m a Houston-based sewist who focuses almost exclusively on garments. Think everyday clothing that’s stylish, well-constructed, and actually wearable. No costumes, no bodycon club dresses — more elevated basics, tailoring, beautiful fabrics, and thoughtful details.

I genuinely love the craft side of sewing — fabric sourcing, fit adjustments, construction techniques, finishing. I get unreasonably excited about deadstock finds, great interfacing, and perfectly pressed seams.

I’m hoping to:

• Meet other garment sewists locally (fabric store runs, coffee + pattern talk?)

• Potentially plan a Europe textile-themed trip

The dream would include:

– Iconic fabric districts

– Textile and fashion museums

– Workshops with local makers

– Independent fabric shops

– Maybe even small atelier visits

– Plus amazing food, walkable cities, and some adventure

Basically a sewist’s dream vacation.

All the tours I’ve found skew very… retirement-bus energy. I’m 40 and looking for something more dynamic — design-focused, curious, and fun.

Im going to be designing an aluminum enclosure in cad to house all the components with an intake air magnetic dust filter. As cool as it looks open with the components front and center it doesnt make much sense in a real world application. I also ordered a gpu riser so I should be able to lay that and the power supply flat to get room for a keyboard on top of it all. Here's a list of the build parts and prices (i know you guys like tracking these things) Everything was purchased within the past week at bestbuy. I did use price match on a few things to match microcenter. I went with bestbuy because I already had a card with them.

What would that be like

Would I wake up every morning and be grateful just to be alive?

Would I get up make some tea sit outside just to let the warmth of the sun wash over me?

Would I look forward to my day?

Would I smile when the birds sang flitting from feeder to bath to the Japanese maple that looks so out of place next to the Virginia creeper.

Would I be happy?

Would the traffic not be so fast and impersonal?  

Would I smile and wave at the cars passing by?

Would I look forward to my career?  The grocery store?  

Would I come home content and not rushed?

Would I have time to rest to clean to paint to daydream?

Would I prepare the best meals?

Would I sit outside in the twilight thankful for another day’s end?

Would I lay my head down at peace at night?

What if love was easy?

Would I wake up and stare at you sleeping and be overcome that you were mine?

Would I slowly rise hesitantly because I wouldn’t want to leave your side?

Would I prepare your coffee and me my chai with your arms wrapped around me laughing about my terrible milk pour?

Would you tell me the names of the birds who blessed us with their sight?

We’d be happy.

Would we kiss each other over and over while we said our goodbyes in the driveway?

Would we text at work sharing silly stories eager to get back to each other?

Would we race back home?  

Loser makes dinner!

But maybe we decide to make it together.

Would we sit out back at night?

Would you hold me under your arms as you pointed out the stars to me even though I already know all their names?

Would you lay me down like a lover would each evening in our bed?

Would you give me forehead kisses and tell me I’m the match for your soul?

I think of those words Gregory sings “If we didn’t have Second Chances we’d all be alone”.

I'm an indie developer diving headfirst into building a stock market startup – think a user-friendly app that gamifies trading and analysis for beginners, all bootstrapped on my own.   
No big team, no VC funding, just me hustling with code, coffee, and a ton of late nights.  
A bit about the project: It's aimed at making stock market insights accessible and fun, with features like real-time simulations, predictive tools, and mostly risk monitoring to protect retail investors. 
 I've been using \[tech stack, e.g., Python/Django for backend, React for frontend, and some ML for predictions\] to bring it to life.  
Why post here? As fellow indies, I know we all face similar battles – from idea validation to marketing on a shoestring budget, dealing with burnout, or pivoting based on user feedback.

 I'd love to share some of my experiences so far:

* Bootstrapping challenges: Started with zero budget, so I focused on MVP development using free tools like AWS free tier and open-source libs. Validated the idea through beta testers on Discord – got 50 sign-ups in the first week!
* Tech wins and fails: Integrated stock APIs (like Twelvedata) seamlessly, but hit walls with real-time data latency. Any tips on optimizing WebSockets for indie-scale apps?
* Growth hacks: Leaning into content marketing via TikTok devlogs and a small newsletter. What's worked for you in getting eyes on your projects without paid ads?
* Lessons learned: Underestimated the legal side (compliance for financial tools is a beast), but it's taught me a lot about risk management in dev.

I'm here to swap stories! If you're an indie dev with a niche project (finance, sims, or otherwise), what's one piece of advice you'd give? Or if you've built something stock-related, hit me with ideas – collaborations welcome!Looking forward to your thoughts.

As she watches from the shore,

Almost waiting for an angel

To grant her wings to soar.



She’s summer rain in deserts,

The spark in frozen eyes,

The coffee stain on cotton

That clings through endless cries.



But she wears a masquerade

That conceals her far too tight,

Behind the staged facade

Her folded wings lose flight.



She is no holy angel

Sent down from distant skies,

For rain that greens the barren sand

Must vanish as the daylight dies.



It leaves the earth to ache alone,

As ringing fades to tone

Like coffee stains that linger

On shirts she once called home",3,1770922868.0,PoetryWritingClub,4,1.0,False
1r325a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicparents/comments/1r325a1/my_mom_hates_me/,My mom hates me,"I’m 23 (f) and btw this is a throwaway account because i have too much personal stuff on my other account. I’ve always had a pretty rough relationship with my mother since I was a kid. She says very mean things to me and then blames me for my reaction to it. For context she kicked me out of the house when I was 19 because I didn’t want her apart of my personal therapy appointment (I paid entirely for my therapy). She’s told me that she’d be better off if I ended myself and also said that I should just get it over with so that she could move on. That was when I was 17/18 and struggling with my mental health. I try so hard to forgive her for everything she’s done and said but she can’t forgive me for a single thing. Just last week she claims I rolled my eyes at her and thought she was stupid so she texted me “lose my phone number,” and has since decided that we should no longer talk to each other. 

I guess I want her to love me more than she wants to love me because I’m willing to forgive when she calls me lazy, selfish, evil, manipulative, the devil, etc. I’m conflicted because I love her so much but she hurts me so much that I feel happier when I’m not talking to her. I’m tired of the hot and cold where we’ll be close and go out to get coffee and then a month later she decides she wants nothing to do with me. She doesn’t know anything about me and when I ask why she doesn’t remember something I told her the day prior she’ll say “you know i’m not always listening to you. You talk too much and I’m busy.” And I think what hurts the most is that she’s in therapy and still acts this way, in fact I think she’s gotten meaner and more selfish since being in therapy. She ignores me and my dad and is always on her phone. Tells us we talk too much and it’s not our fault she can’t listen to us every second of the day. I’m so tired of wanting a relationship with her even though I know it hurts me. Sorry for the long rant just needed to get it off my chest.

Unfortunately I don't know very many Soulmate prompts other than the classics  
  
  
  
**Soulmate prompts I know**  
  
**• red string of fate:** the classic that I assume everyone has at least heard of once or is familiar with the red string of fate is everyone is with a red string tied around either their pinky or ankle and the string will lead to their soulmate only ypu can't see your own string  
  
**• countdown timer:** a everyone is born with a timer on their wrist.That counts down until the moment they meet their soul mate  
  
**• First Words:** everyone is born with the first words that you soulmate will say to you somewhere on their body, it could be something sweet, romantic, weird or embarrassing  
  
**• Black and white:** everyone in the world can only in black and white until they meet their soulmate or look into their soulmate eyes for the first time then they can suddenly see colour (also if someone losses their soulmate their world returns to back and white)  
  
**• Matching tattoos:** soulmates will have matching tattoo/symbols somewhere on their body that will either represent them both combination like for example a soulmate pairing between a writer and a artist could be a writer's quill and a art brush together in the soulmate favorite color  or like Bruce Wayne might have a bat and catwman might have a cat so their tattoo could be a cat looking up at a bat  
  
**• Soulmate Name/Initials on writs:** list one is pretty obvious and doesn't need much.Explanation but in this are you people would be born with their soul might's name or Initials on their wrist  
  
**• Shared Notes/Injuries:** in this Au soulmate can communicate with each other by drawing on their own skin and whatever is written or drawn on one person's skin appears on the other's  
  
**• Shared pain and injureies**: in this, are you so mate?Can feel each other's pain or/and share injures so if one soulmate got burnt their hand on hot coffee their soulmate will feel the same pain and/or get the same injury. There's also a chance they can share scars  
  
**Note**: apparently, there is another one called the soulmate gose where a angry goose will suddenly appear and chase one person around trying to chase them into the direction of their soulmate and while I ve never actually read or seen anything with this i personal just love the idea

**Edit**: please can everyone work on making this popular as I hope see in lots of different soul mate.Prompts could help other people who are looking for fan fiction or writing ideas also i think the whole thing will be fun for eveyone to take part in or read

This isn't about extreme deprivation; it’s about tightening up your nutrition, increasing your daily movement, and proving to yourself that you can stay consistent. By focusing on high-impact changes over a short window, you can shed water weight, reduce bloating, and clear the mental fog that often comes with a processed diet.

# The 2-Week Strategy for Results

* **The ""Clean Slate"" Rule:** For 14 days, prioritize whole, single-ingredient foods. Eliminating added sugars and liquid calories (sodas, fancy coffees) is often enough to see a visible difference in just the first week.
* **Non-Exercise Activity (NEAT):** While workouts are great, the calories burned through daily movement—like taking the stairs or walking while on the phone—add up significantly over two weeks.
* **Strategic Hydration:** Drinking water before meals isn't just a cliché; it naturally aids digestion and helps prevent overeating by ensuring you aren't confusing thirst with hunger.

1r3207a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1r3207a/bought_a_white_couch_have_3_cats_mom_is_coming/,Bought a white couch. Have 3 cats. Mom is coming. Pray for me.,"Okay, I need to know if I’m delusional here.



A while ago, I bought this white upholstered couch for my apartment. I knew it wasn’t practical. Indeed, I have three cats. I drink red wine. I drink coffee. I’m not exactly living a beige, spill-free lifestyle. But it looked so good in the showroom, and I convinced myself I’d “be careful.”



Fast forward to now... this couch has seen things.



The cats have definitely… contributed. I’ve cleaned up after them every time, but you know how that goes. Then there was the red wine incident. And the coffee... I tried all the Pinterest tricks, store sprays, blotting, and even praying. And the stains faded a little, but they’re very much still there. So I did what any sane person would do and strategically covered everything with cute cushions and a throw.



And now my mom just told me she and my sister are coming to stay with me for a week.



For context: my mom is a cleaning fanatic. Growing up, nothing was ever clean enough. And my little sister was the type to immediately report if I spilled or broke anything. I’m 30-something and somehow still feel 12 thinking about them seeing this couch.



I found this local Uphostery Steamers cleaning service that claims they can handle old stains, but I haven’t called yet. I just wanna ask, can old red wine and mystery pet stains actually be fully removed from white fabric? Or am I about to panic-buy a new couch just to avoid judgment?



Because right now I’m half laughing and half genuinely stressed about a piece of furniture.

I'm sure there's more, but when I'm looking for my next adventure, it is discerning that I have to do a deep dive to see if this place actually exists, so that I don't book the travel and find nothing is there.

1r31vco,https://www.reddit.com/r/focusedmen/comments/1r31vco/the_psychology_of_why_your_hustle_is_destroying/,The psychology of why your “hustle” is destroying you (science-based),"Started tracking my ""productive hours"" last year and realized I was clocking 14-hour days but achieving less than when I worked 6. Wild, right? Turns out half of Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and basically anyone with a LinkedIn bio mentioning ""grind"" is in the same boat. I went deep into research from neuroscience journals, psychology podcasts, and honestly way too many self-optimization books trying to figure out where tf we all went wrong.

Here's what nobody tells you: your brain isn't designed for constant performance mode. Society glorifies the hustle, tech culture weaponizes FOMO, and our biology literally rebels when we ignore its signals. But here's the thing, these patterns can be interrupted once you recognize them.

\*\*Your body is screaming but you keep hitting snooze\*\*

Chronic fatigue that coffee can't fix anymore. Weird muscle tension. Your resting heart rate creeping up. These aren't badges of honor, they're distress signals. Dr. Matthew Walker's research at Berkeley shows that sleep deprivation literally shrinks your brain's decision-making centers. When you're running on 5 hours consistently, you're essentially operating with mild cognitive impairment.

I grabbed \*[Why We Sleep](https://www.amazon.in/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/0241980012�)\* by Matthew Walker after a friend practically shoved it in my face. Walker is a neuroscience professor who's advised Google and Pixar on sleep optimization. The book completely destroys the ""I'll sleep when I'm dead"" mentality with actual brain scans showing what happens when you don't. Best book on biological optimization I've ever touched. This book will make you question everything you think you know about productivity.

\*\*You've replaced actual goals with performative busyness\*\*

Real talk: when was the last time you finished something meaningful versus just adding more to your plate? The glorification of being ""busy"" is a trap. Cal Newport talks about this extensively in his podcast and research. Deep Work, focused attention on high-value tasks, produces exponentially more results than scattered shallow work across 50 browser tabs.

There's this phenomenon called ""productive procrastination"" where you do low-stakes tasks to avoid the actually important scary ones. You'll reorganize your entire Notion dashboard instead of making that career pivot you've been thinking about for two years.

If you want to go deeper on breaking these patterns but don't have the energy to read another book, there's this app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been helpful. It's an AI-powered learning platform from Columbia alumni and ex-Google folks that turns insights from productivity research, psychology books, and expert talks into personalized audio you can actually absorb. 

You can tell it your specific struggle, like ""I'm burned out from overworking but don't know how to set boundaries"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan pulling from sources like Newport's work, Walker's research, and other behavioral science. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples. Makes it way easier to actually internalize this stuff instead of just adding more unread books to the pile.

\*\*Your relationships are becoming transactional\*\*

Everything becomes networking. Every coffee is a ""connection opportunity."" You mentally calculate ROI on spending time with your parents. When someone shares something vulnerable, you're already thinking about your response instead of actually listening. 

The research is pretty brutal here. Harvard's 80-year longitudinal study on happiness found that relationship quality is THE biggest predictor of life satisfaction and longevity. Not career success. Not wealth. Actual deep human connection. But hustle culture treats relationships like LinkedIn contacts.

\*\*The anxiety never actually goes away\*\*

You hit the goal. Then immediately the goalposts move. There's always another benchmark, another person doing more, another zero to add to your revenue target. This is called the hedonic treadmill and it's extensively documented in positive psychology research.

Dr. K from HealthyGamerGG (he's a Harvard psychiatrist who works with high achievers) breaks this down incredibly well. Your brain's reward system gets desensitized when you're constantly chasing. You need bigger hits just to feel normal. It's literally the same neurological pattern as addiction.

Check out the \*\*Huberman Lab\*\* podcast, specifically his episodes on dopamine and motivation. Andrew Huberman is a Stanford neuroscientist who explains how constant stimulation and achievement-chasing actually depletes your baseline dopamine. Makes it harder to find joy in anything. His episode on dopamine scheduling changed how I structure my entire week.

\*\*You've stopped doing things just because they're enjoyable\*\*

Everything needs to be optimized. You can't just go for a run, it needs to be tracked, analyzed, compared. Reading becomes ""knowledge acquisition."" Hobbies become ""side hustles."" Even your downtime gets monetized or justified as ""recovery for better performance.""

This is where apps like \*\*[Finch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finch-self-care-pet/id1528595748)\*\* actually help. It's a self-care app that gamifies taking care of yourself without the productivity guilt. You get a little bird companion that grows as you do basic human things like drinking water, going outside, or talking to a friend. Sounds silly but it genuinely helps reframe self-care as valuable in itself, not just fuel for more work.

\*\*Your identity is completely fused with your output\*\*

Who are you if you're not achieving? When someone asks about you, do you immediately launch into what you're working on? If your startup failed or you got fired tomorrow, would you know who you are?

This hits different when you read \*The Courage to Be Disliked\* by Ichiro Kishimi. It's based on Adlerian psychology and completely dismantles the idea that your worth comes from achievement or others' recognition. The authors are Japanese philosophers who've sold millions of copies. Reading it felt like someone reached into my brain and untangled years of conditioning about needing to prove my value through constant output.

\*\*You're optimizing for the wrong metrics\*\*

Revenue over fulfillment. Followers over genuine influence. Hours worked over impact created. The ""hustle"" often just means doing more of what's measurable rather than what's meaningful.

There's this concept from Goodhart's Law: ""When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."" You start optimizing for the metric instead of the underlying goal. Like hitting your step count by pacing in your apartment at 11pm instead of actually moving your body in ways that feel good.

\*\*Physical symptoms are becoming your baseline\*\*

Jaw clenching. Shallow breathing. That weird shoulder tension that never fully releases. Digestive issues that appeared out of nowhere. Your body keeps the score, and it's losing.

\*\*Insight Timer\*\* has some genuinely helpful guided meditations specifically for nervous system regulation. Not the woo-woo stuff, actual evidence-based practices from therapists and neuroscientists. The app has free content from researchers like Tara Brach and Jack Kornfield who've been studying contemplative practices for decades. The body scan meditations help you actually notice these physical patterns before they become chronic issues.

Look, I'm not saying ambition is bad or that you should quit your job and live in a van. But there's a difference between sustainable ambition and the toxic performative hustle that's normalized in certain circles. The actual highest performers, the people doing groundbreaking work, they're not grinding 24/7. They're strategic about energy management, they protect their recovery time, they maintain relationships that matter.

You know how it is – you get a seemingly straightforward request, and then it snowballs into an avalanche of conflicting priorities, each demanding your immediate, undivided attention. That was me, last quarter, trying to launch a new reporting tool.

Our users, bless their hearts, were practically begging for more granular data exports and custom dashboards. They painted vivid pictures of how this would transform their workflows, eyes sparkling with anticipation. On the other side of the ring, my engineering team, those wizards of code, looked at the specs and just... sighed. 'Months,' they'd say, 'and it'll delay every other critical bug fix and stability improvement we have lined up.' You could almost feel the weight of their current sprint commitments pressing down on them.

And then, *then* there was the business side. My boss, with the best intentions, had already pitched this 'revolutionary' reporting feature to a major potential client, promising it by the end of Q3. The pressure was immense. I was stuck in the middle, feeling like a human juggling act, trying to catch flaming chainsaws of user desire, engineering reality, and executive expectations all at once. My calendar was a graveyard of back-to-back meetings, each one a battleground for resources and deadlines.

The breakthrough finally came after a particularly brutal whiteboard session, fueled by cold coffee and sheer desperation. We decided to slice the 'revolutionary' feature into an MVP that solved the immediate, highest-impact pain point for our users, promising the more complex parts in later iterations. It wasn't perfect, but it shipped, and everyone (mostly) lived to tell the tale. The relief when that first version went live was palpable, like shedding a 50-pound backpack.

Seriously, though, has anyone else ever felt like they needed a degree in diplomacy just to survive a feature launch? How do you guys handle those situations where everyone wants a piece of the pie, but the oven's only big enough for a crumb?",1,1770922030.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

Like, genuinely awful. Someone could practically wear a neon sign saying ""I LIKE YOU"" and I'd convince myself they were just being polite. Turns out, I'm not alone in this. After diving deep into research on attraction, body language studies, and behavioral psychology, I've realized most of us miss obvious signs because we're either too anxious, overthinking, or just unaware of what to look for.

Here's what actually matters, backed by science and real human behavior patterns:

**They remember the small stuff**

When someone likes you, their brain literally prioritizes information about you. This isn't just cute, it's neuroscience. The ventral tegmental area (part of the brain's reward system) lights up when we're attracted to someone, making us hyper-attentive to details about them.

They'll remember you mentioned loving a specific coffee order three weeks ago. They'll bring up that random story about your childhood dog. They're not just being polite, their brain is cataloging YOU because you matter to them.

**The ""lean in"" thing is real**

Body language researchers have found that we unconsciously orient our bodies toward people we're interested in. It's called proxemics, the study of personal space.

If someone consistently leans toward you during conversations, angles their body in your direction even in group settings, or finds reasons to be physically closer, that's a green light. Dr. Monica Moore's research at Webster University found that proximity-seeking behavior is one of the most reliable indicators of romantic interest.

**They laugh at your mediocre jokes**

Not because you're secretly a comedy genius, but because laughter releases oxytocin and creates bonding. A study published in Evolutionary Psychology found that people laugh significantly more around those they're attracted to, even when the humor is objectively not that funny.

If they're giggling at your terrible puns or finding your awkward moments endearing rather than cringe, pay attention.

**The texting pattern tells you everything**

Here's what I learned from reading ""Dataclysm"" by Christian Rudder (OkCupid's cofounder who analyzed millions of interactions). People who are interested respond faster, match your text length, and ask follow up questions. They're not playing games with response times or giving you one word answers.

This book is insanely good at breaking down what people actually do versus what they say. It uses real data from dating platforms to show you the truth about human attraction. Changed how I view digital communication completely.

**They find excuses to touch you**

Touch is powerful. Even brief, ""accidental"" contact on the arm or shoulder releases oxytocin and builds connection. Research from DePauw University found that appropriate touch during conversation increases positive feelings and perceived closeness.

Light touches on your arm during conversation, adjusting your collar, playful shoulder bumps. These aren't accidents. They're testing boundaries and creating intimacy.

**They mirror your energy and movements**

Mirroring is subconscious mimicry and it's a massive indicator of interest. The Chameleon Effect research by Tanya Chartrand and John Bargh at NYU showed that we unconsciously copy the behaviors of people we like or want to connect with.

They'll match your speaking pace, adopt similar postures, even start using phrases you use. It's their brain trying to create rapport and connection without them even realizing it.

For understanding the psychology behind all this, ""The Like Switch"" by Jack Schafer (former FBI agent) is phenomenal. It breaks down the science of influence and attraction in super practical ways. Schafer spent years studying how to get people to like and trust him for interrogations, and he applies those same principles to everyday relationships. Best book on reading people I've encountered.

Also check out Vanessa Van Edwards' YouTube channel. Her videos on body language and social cues are research backed and actually useful, not the typical ""how to manipulate people"" garbage. She breaks down real studies and shows you what to look for in actual interactions.

Another resource worth checking out is BeFreed, a personalized learning app built by former Google engineers that pulls from psychology books, dating research, and expert insights to create custom audio content based on your specific goals. Say you want to ""read attraction signals better as an overthinker,"" it generates a learning plan just for you, drawing from sources like the books mentioned above plus behavioral science papers and real relationship experts. You can adjust how deep you want to go, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive too, there's even a smoky, conversational style that makes complex psychology way easier to absorb during your commute or at the gym.

And honestly, the app Finch helped me build better self awareness around my own social anxiety and overthinking patterns. It's a self care app disguised as a cute bird game, but it genuinely helped me recognize when I was spiraling into ""they definitely don't like me"" mode for no reason.

The thing is, most people aren't as hard to read as we think. We're just scared of being wrong, of misreading situations, of making things awkward. But attraction leaves breadcrumbs. Biology makes sure of that. Our brains are hardwired to signal interest, even when we're trying to play it cool.

You're not imagining things. Trust your gut a little more. The signs are probably there, you just need to know what you're looking for.",1,1770921753.0,MenInModernDating,0,1.0,False

My panel now shows the same. I've been taking a prenatal with iron for a few months so clearly that isn't enough? Now after doing some reading I'm seeing so many things I didn't know - you aren't supposed to drink coffee within 1 hour of taking iron because it decreased absorption, you should ideally take it on an empty stomach, and you should take it with 80-100mg vitamin C to assist absorption (at least this is in the prenatal).

Just wondering if others had a similar issue with previous pregnancies and whether they were able to have adequate stores built up over the remainder of the pregnancy? I'm worried that now that it's low, I won't have time to build up iron stores quickly enough before the iron demand during pregnancy ramps up.

1r31k4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1r31k4a/hr_the_art_of_saying_hello/,[HR] The Art of Saying Hello,"The scent of freshly varnished wood gave the bar new life. He sipped his cold amber pale ale, letting the bitter, woody liquid coat his taste buds. Chic shelves, polished leather chairs, and dim low-hanging lamps surrounded him — Fridays here were for decompressing. Work, life, family, ambition: everyone carried their own weight. Some found release in meditation, some in company. He found it in solitude.

The bar itself was a converted two-story colonial house, its age disguised beneath new varnish and quiet jazz. Once, this very room had likely been a living room — generations of families must have gathered here before, their laughter now replaced by the soft clinking of glasses. In the next room, past the old archway, was a small coffee bar and the narrow hallway to the restroom. Few people came here anymore.

Outside, the 5 o’clock sun cast long shadows across the sea. The old lighthouse — a weathered monument on the horizon — stood watch over the coast, enriching the view with its quiet legacy. Stress, responsibility, the endless rush of modern life — so easily one could get caught in it. But he didn’t. He breathed in the salt air, listened to the waves, and watched the quiet songs of the world. Sometimes, the only choice was to focus on the now.

His mind wandered and eyes glazed when he spotted someone at the other end of the bar — a familiar shape, like an old photograph with edges blurred. Should he say hello? Nod? Pretend he hadn’t seen them at all? He wasn’t sure if it was really his acquaintance.

The cold, sweating glass of ale looked equally puzzled as he tried to gather his thoughts. Would it be rude to speak? The possible acquaintance sat alone, scrolling through their phone, surely not wanting an interruption. How could he disrupt another’s peace?

He took a slow sip. Think. Decide.

A nod might be appropriate, he thought. A nod was both a greeting and non-committal enough to not pressure a response. The ‘hello’ of non-verbal communication — non-offensive, all-purpose, innocuous. Yet, if the stranger was actually an acquaintance, maybe a nod would be perceived as dismissive.

Maybe a small smile with the nod? Too eager. Too casual. Too uncertain. He shifted in his chair, letting the cold glass sweat through his fingers. If he pretended not to see them, would that be safer? Would they notice? Would they think he was rude, or worse — forgetful?

A nod seemed out of the question. He wondered if a verbal greeting would work. “Hey” was a strong contender — simple, friendly, inviting but respectful of their space. “Hi” was another option — short, universal, not overly eager. “Good evening” — formal enough if they were strangers, but friendly enough to be warm.

Sipping her drink, the stranger chuckled at her phone.

There was also the question of timing. When should he say hello, if he did at all? The stranger hadn’t looked up for the last few minutes. An abrupt greeting would come off as brash — even if she had been an acquaintance. Should he wait until she looked up? That would be weird and require him to spend a certain amount of time vaguely looking in her direction to time it right. Too early, and he risked missing it. Too late, and the moment would be gone forever. A greeting wasn’t something you could redo.

Draft beer poured out of the tap as he nodded for a refill.

Whether the stranger was, in fact, a stranger, played through his mind. An acquaintance could do well with a “hi.” A stranger was better suited to a nod. Tone also mattered. Too loud could come off as brash if they didn’t know each other; too quiet risked giving the impression he didn’t remember her face.

How did one deal with misremembering a person? Not being sure of their status made the situation even more precarious. Surely, if they came up to you, you’d acknowledge them, then ask vague questions about how they’ve been and search for clues about who they are. But being the asker was different. There was art to it, especially if you were uncertain whether you knew each other. To disturb their peace risked a bad impression — or worse.

He shifted his weight in his chair and leaned back.

The sun was starting to set as he fiddled with his glass. The passage of time waits for no man, yet he remained in his seat, wondering what to do. The longer he delayed, the greater the risk. If the stranger was an acquaintance, the hesitation could be perceived as standoffish. If the stranger was, in fact, a stranger, he could seem anti-social. None of these outcomes seemed positive, yet he still had no clue who this person was.

Was it a colleague? He’d always had a bad memory for faces, especially at work. He made a habit of keeping every business card he ever received, carefully storing them for situations like these. Was it one of his wife’s friends? The stranger seemed about his wife’s age and did seem familiar. This compounded in his brain.

Her short, sharp laugh — a sound he usually associated with the kitchen and his wife’s stories about work — flickered a connection. Yes. It was his wife’s friend, the one named… What was her name?

He fidgeted with his glass.

Realizing this, he resolved to greet her. The nod was too distant, too harsh. A hello was the only option. Yet, a hello said in a vacuum would be too artificial. He needed a wave. But what sort of wave? A simple hand raise? One with movement? Or a salute of sorts? Each had its advantages, but none struck the tone he wanted to set.

The sun, barely visible, cast a fading shadow over the lighthouse.

There was the option of going up to say hello, but that posed its own risks. Would he interrupt while she was busy? Would it come off as a surprise and startle her? Would it seem presumptuous to intrude on her corner of the empty bar? Whatever option he chose, he had to do so soon.

Another sip.

He imagined what would happen if he said hello and it wasn’t her. She’d give him that look — the one strangers give when they’re forced into unwanted small talk. Then he’d have to explain himself. There was no dignified way to recover from that.

Mustering up the courage, he decided: a hello, a simple hand raise, a slight smile, a nod. He would time it when the bartender returned from the back, so he could pass it off as asking for another beer if he missed his cue.

He waited.

Filled with resolve, three minutes passed. No bartender. Only the sound of the faint evening breeze.

His forehead began to bead with sweat as he fiddled with his half-empty glass. He couldn’t wave with a greasy face. He’d look unkempt, ragged. That was not an option. He adjusted in his seat and stood to go to the bathroom.

Step by step, he debated. The nod would work well, but would it work with the hand raise? The “hello” would work if she were a stranger, but she was an acquaintance. A “hi” was ideal.

Looking into the mirror as he washed his face, suds clinging to his five o’clock shadow, he saw determination.

His shoes made a slight thud with each step back. As he got closer, it seemed to grow louder — thump, thump, thump. His heart beat to the sound.

Approaching the main room, he straightened his shoulders, his determination solidified.

The acquaintance had gone.

The seat where she had sat was empty. The only sound was the faint rinse of her glass in the sink. The bar had returned to silence.

He sat back down, his freshened face cooling in the evening air. The lighthouse blinked once, then again. Alone, he lifted his glass and took another sip.

“Hello,” he murmured to the empty stool.        ",1,1770921552.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

then I started building the car, ordering boxes like a maniac, doing the old wood jobs and sewage jobs. got the taxi job, pretty nice. 

engine is practically together, missing some parts. lost my apartment, no biggie. 

but I'm so tired all of a sudden. fatigue rising exponentially. why? I drink more coffee and energy drinks to counter this. 

I went in to Perajärvi as soon as I woke up to grab the Gigi to do two sewage jobs. 80% fatigue over the travel. and I Google the fatigue system, and apparently I'm addicted to caffeine now. 

taxi boss called me and told me I had to put in more hours or he would take my cab. but I can't complete a taxi job without coffee and I need to abstain to slowly get rid of my addiction. 

suddenly I realised that my winter car is so, so much harder than my summer car, I'm almost as depressed as my character is, and the Problem is also a problem on top of everything, though carefully satisfying it with one beer and then filling up with tap water. 

I'm brewing Kilju right now, and guess I have to sleep in the truck when visiting Perajärvi to not fall asleep behind the wheel and crash to death on the forest roads. 

as a swede, I can relate so much to the hardships of winter, and this game depicts it so well.

I'm terrified. I'm worried I won't get the chance. I'm worried I'll chciken out.

I've tried asking her out before but I've always chickened out. I've always froze before asking and jsut never said anything, even if I've planned what to say.

We get on quite well and I think I have an opportunity to ask her out tomorrow, though I'm also worried I'll miss the opportunity - we wlak together between lessons but as well sometimes leave the first at different times I might miss her :(

I've realised my issue is probably that I've built this moment up too much so I feel much more pressure than it should be. I'm jsut going to ask her for coffee but I'm terrified 😓. 

Basically what I need is any tips on how to relax about it and make sure I don't freeze or chciken out. I'm sure if I just say her name to start talking I'll be okay but I'm terrified that I'll mess it upnor jsut freeze. Honestly I bet I will.

1r31bat,https://www.reddit.com/r/KidneyStones/comments/1r31bat/m53_13mm_and_9mm_stones_laser_lithotripsy_and_10/,M53 - 13mm and 9mm stones - laser lithotripsy and 10 days of stent - my experience,"TL;DR: I’m 53M. Had a 13 mm and a 9mm kidney stone. Had laser lithotripsy and then a stent for 10 days. Intermittent good and bad days with the stent. Had one night of what I think was actively passing a painful fragment. Stent hopefully comes out tomorrow.

That’s the gist - what follows is the full narrative. I hope it helps someone understand their own situation. 

**History** 

About 10-12 years ago I had a 9mm stone that was treated with external shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) that was followed up with whatever the procedure was called when they still have to go in and remove the remaining fragments (I just called it “the claw”). I remember the whole process taking a long time (couple of months I think) and the extended time with the stent until after “The Claw” was more painful than any of the pre-procedure pain from the stones. I never did have to pass a stone of significant size (lots of “gravel” though) that time - so other than the “big stone ache” the stent was the worst part of the experience. 

I should also note that I have a fairly high pain tolerance. I never thought so, but my wife tells me things that I shrug off would have her in severe pain so I’ll take her word for it. 

**Symptoms and Diagnosis**

About 12 months ago I noticed some intermittent but recurring pain in my left flank that would occasionally radiate to my left testicle. It was less severe than that original stone—and would go away after a day or so—so just chalked it up to being sore from the gym. 

Fast forward to about January 7th (a little over a month ago) and that week the pain was persistent and radiating continuously to my testicle. I had a chiropractor appointment for Friday and told myself if the adjustment didn’t affect the symptoms then I’d get checked for a kidney stone. 

(As an aside, I hadn’t told my wife about the symptoms until we were in the chiros office together. So she was mad at me for a few days!). 

Needless to say, given the sub I’m posting on, the chiropractor appointment didn’t help. (I already knew it wouldn’t because the pain was not “movement adjacent”—no amount of stretching or massage ever touched it—so I was really just in denial). 

At this point the pain is either non existent or a 1/10. At its worst it was never more than like a 3 or 4. It was never about the intensity—just the chronic persistence. So I went online to make an appointment with my PCP and the first available one was end of the month. I was going to wait, but my much wiser wife told me to go to urgent care on Saturday Jan 10th (the next day). 

I went to urgent care and described my symptoms without mentioning kidney stones - and the nurse immediately started asking questions that I knew she was thinking kidney stones. I told her I thought it might be a stone, too and that I’d had one a decade ago. They did a quick urine dip and found blood and proteins in my urine (the blood was not visible - but it was detectible). I thought they’d do an x-ray there (it’s why I chose that urgent care—I knew they had on-site imaging) but they sent me to the ER to get a CT scan. They weren’t too worried as there were no signs of infection or active complete blockage but thought it best to be sure. They called the ER to let them know I was coming. 

After an 8 minute drive I’m registering at the ER. 

(Another aside, two years ago I moved from VA to PA and it was from an area where the closest hospital was 30min away. My new place in PA is in the outskirts of a small city and is no more than 10 minutes from anything including the regional hospital. So nice not to have to drive 20-30 minutes to get to civilization). 

Of course, now I’m a new patient again and go through triage, all the same questions, they ask about my pain levels, etc. They take some blood this time. They also want more urine but I had just given my last oz to urgent care. So they hooked me up with a bag of saline and ordered a CT. 

I was very fortunate for a quick and efficient experience at the ER. I was in the waiting room at 10:22. They had taken blood, had me on the saline and ordered the CT by 10:38. The CT was taken by 10:46. And I had the CT results by 11:33. That’s miracle timelines at any ER! 

Anyway, here are the actual results from the CT report:

* There is a 1.3 x 0.8 cm stone in the left ureteropelvic junction causing mild left hydronephrosis (48 of series 2).
* There is a 0.9 x 0.4 cm nonobstructive stone in the mid left kidney.
* There is a 0.4 cm nonobstructive stone in the lower left kidney.
* There is a 3mm nonobstructive stone in the lower right kidney. No right hydronephrosis is seen.

So… yup. Kidney stones. And the big fellas weren’t going to be passing on their own. 

The ER PA came back in the room just as I was finished reading the scan results (they posted in my patient portal so I got to them first). He started giving me the standard spiel and I told him I saw the results, had a stone before and I got the gist of things. 

Funny story, he then tried to ease my nerves—even though I was showing no signs of nervousness—by telling me how the stone is big but not that big. And how this one patient had a stone the size of an egg and how that patient needed a Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL) (though he just said a “tube in his back”) but reassured me that I wouldn’t need that. This is a funny because it didn’t phase me at all; I would love to hear more about his little war story. But he didn’t know me. If it was my wife or mother-in-law his attempt to calm them would have done exactly the opposite and totally freaked them out. As it was, I was glad I told my wife not to come with me.

Anyway, it ended up with a referral to a urologist. The ER PA asked if I needed pain meds and I said no… but he prescribed Percocet anyway “just in case” and he prescribed Flowmax. 

On Monday 1/12, I scheduled a urologist appointment for Jan 21. Note: I filled both prescriptions from the ER but I didn’t need the Percocet and I didn’t want to take the Flowmax until talking to the urologist.

Another funny story. When talking to my parents they mentioned my sister had just passed a couple of stones two weeks ago! That was also her second time with stones. So it clearly runs in the family. My Dad was unsympathetic and just said neither my sister nor I drink enough coffee (neither of drink it at all our whole family thinks we’re weird).

In the meantime, I did some “Dr. Chat GPT” research and was interested to see that since my ESWL a decade ago that the laser lithotripsy was a thing and and that they'd be able to take out the larger fragments at the same time resulting in a faster recovery time. So I was hopeful that when I met with the urologist he’d recommend that.

The urologist appointment was like 10 minutes. I told him I’d read the scan results and that I’d had the ESWL a decade ago. He told me that we should do the new laser litho (which I was glad since I didn’t have to ask him about it) and that I’d have a stent for 7-10 days after the procedure. He asked if I had questions—I didn’t—and sent me to scheduling. I scheduled my procedure for February 3 and had to get blood drawn, an ECG, and surgical clearance from my PCP before then. I’d come back to the office on 2/13 to remove the stent and I’d need an x-ray the day before that. 

I went immediately to the lab place and had the blood and ECG done and I already had a routine checkup with PCP planned for Jan 30. So nothing to do but wait. 

In the intervening days - there were no real changes to my symptoms. The low grade pain/aches would crop up from time to time and last a day or two and go away. 

My wife did however insist that I start drinking more water. I’m happy to say that since that weekend at urgent care I’ve been drinking 75-100oz of water (usually with a few squirts of lemon/lime juice) a day. I’m working on making it a habit; but my long-standing, officially diagnosed ADD makes it a challenge. I've also stopped my iced-tea habit and switched to lemonade (It's not cheap - but Simply brand lemonade is pretty darn good after trying about 4 different brands). 

**Treatment and Recovery**

Fast forward to February 3. My procedure was first thing in the morning. It went well. I never talked to the doc after, but my wife did. He said he “got” most of the stones in the left kidney; the big one and the two smaller ones, too. And successfully placed the stent. As I was coming out of recovery the nurse said the only thing keeping me in the hospital was I had to pee. I tried but couldn’t pee in the recovery room, but once I was back in the patient room I peed right away (the nurse seemed surprised I peed that fast). 

I mentioned I was in quite a bit of pain at that point. The nurse said she could give me something, but I’d have to stay in the hospital for another hour or so to be monitored. I said,”Nope, I wanna go home.” So we were out of there and home by about noon.

I should mention—and I’m not happy with this—the urologist didn’t prescribe ANYTHING for me; no flowmax, no pain meds, no real pain management instructions, nothing. The nurse mentioned using Tylenol—but limiting to 3000 mg per day. I knew from my Dr. Chat GPT research and prior experience what I needed to do, but I was disappointed in the lack of compassionate instructions on this front.

So the rest of that Tuesday I’m in quite a bit of pain. Pee is bloody. Im basically in bed and not sure if I’m recovering more from the anesthesia or the procedure. I really don’t want to take the Percocet if I can avoid it, and I’m limited to 3000mg of Tylenol per day (so basically three doses of two extra-strength Tylenol a day). I slept most of the rest of the day - but by the evening the pain was keeping me from resting. 

This subreddit actually helped me at that point! Since I had nothing other than Tylenol prescribed I started doing some online searching for what might ease the pain from the stent and on some thread someone mentioned Azo. I send my wife out to get some for me and it really helped get through the first few days and then some.

So here’s the timeline since the procedure:

* Tuesday (Procedure Day): Lot pain, lot of rest, ugly bloody pee.
* Wednesday: Felt great, had taken the day off, got some errands and easy chores done. Felt like I had the tylenol/Azo schedule down to stay in front of the discomfort.
* Thursday: Overdid it on Wednesday - felt not great. I work from home and had a normal day, but mostly from bed.
* Friday – Sunday: Some good days some no-so-good days, and other than some active pain from the stent while peeing was never more than just uncomfortable.
* Monday: I had to plow my driveway and little private lane with my little lawn-mower snow-plaw. Figured since I was sitting down it’d be fine - but the twisting to look over my shoulder while backing up irritated the stent. So was uncomfortable the rest of the day.
* Tuesday: Fine
* Tuesday night / Early Wednesday morning: I felt a brief “stabbing” pain around 7pm but it went away. By 2am I was in significant and persistent pain until about 6am. I assume I was actively passing a bigger / pointier fragment. Did a lot of drinking water, walking around my kitchen and feeling sorry for myself until I got to sleep around 6:30. I’ve noticed visible stone fragments in the toilet since then.
* Wednesday: No more pain, but I was deliriously exhausted from the overnight pain and lack of sleep. I tried to work but couldn’t really get much done. I had stopped taking the Azo, but since the pain overnight I’ve started taking it agin and my pee is back to being red/orange.
* Thursday (Today): I feel good. Almost no pain except when peeing. Went to get my x-ray.

So that’s where I am at. Hoping the x-ray is clear and the stent comes out tomorrow. 

That’s a lot of words but—other than the urologist not coving stent pain management—I feel like it has been kind of an ideal scenario across the board. ",1,1770921022.0,KidneyStones,0,1.0,False

That weird tension in the air. The lingering looks. The way someone lights up when you walk into the room. But you second-guess everything because you don't want to look like an idiot who misread the signals. I get it. After diving deep into body language research, evolutionary psychology studies, and even some wild insights from behavioral experts like Vanessa Van Edwards and Matthew Hussey's podcasts, I realized most of us are walking around completely blind to these cues. We're literally programmed to notice attraction signals, but modern anxiety and overthinking have messed with our instincts. So here's what actually happens when someone's into you, backed by science and real human behavior.

## 1. Their Body Literally Turns Toward You

When someone's attracted, their entire body becomes a compass pointing at you. Feet, torso, shoulders. All aimed in your direction. This isn't some magical thing, it's biology. Research from nonverbal communication studies shows that we unconsciously orient ourselves toward things we value or desire.

If you're talking in a group and their feet are pointed at you (not toward the exit or someone else), that's your first clue. Their body is screaming ""I want to be closer to you"" even if their mouth is talking about the weather.

## 2. The Eyes Don't Lie (Especially the Pupils)

Eye contact is obvious, right? Wrong. There's eye contact, and then there's that kind of eye contact. When someone's attracted to you, they hold your gaze a beat longer than normal. But here's the kicker, their pupils dilate. You can't fake that. It's an automatic response controlled by the autonomic nervous system.

A study published in Psychological Science found that pupil dilation is directly linked to emotional arousal and attraction. So if you catch someone's eyes looking bigger than usual when they're talking to you, boom. That's biology doing its thing.

Also, watch for the triangle gaze. Their eyes move from your eyes to your mouth and back. That's not accidental. That's their brain imagining what it would be like to kiss you.

## 3. They Mirror Your Movements

Mirroring is one of those sneaky signs that flies completely under the radar. When someone's attracted, they subconsciously copy your body language. You lean in, they lean in. You cross your legs, they cross theirs. You pick up your drink, guess what? They're reaching for theirs too.

This comes from research on rapport building and connection. Mirroring creates a sense of ""we're alike"" and builds intimacy without anyone saying a word. Vanessa Van Edwards talks about this in her work on charisma and connection, how mirroring is one of the most powerful nonverbal cues of attraction.

## 4. They Find Excuses to Touch You

Touch is huge. But we're not talking about obvious, over the top contact. It's the light brush on your arm when they're making a point. The ""accidental"" bump when you're walking. The playful shove when you make a joke.

According to touch research in social psychology, even brief, casual touch increases feelings of connection and attraction. If someone keeps finding reasons to be in your physical space or makes light contact, their brain is testing the waters. They want to see how you respond to closeness.

## 5. They Remember Weird, Random Details About You

Someone who's attracted to you pays attention. Like, creepy levels of attention (but in a good way). They remember that offhand comment you made three weeks ago about hating cilantro. They ask about your dog by name. They bring up something you mentioned in passing like it's important.

Why? Because to them, you are important. Our brains prioritize information about people we care about or are attracted to. It's called selective attention. If they're cataloging the small stuff, it means you're taking up real estate in their mind.

## 6. Their Voice Changes When They Talk to You

This one's wild but real. Research shows that people alter their vocal tone when speaking to someone they're attracted to. Women's voices often get slightly higher and more melodic. Men's voices can drop lower, becoming more resonant.

It's not a conscious thing. It's an evolutionary tactic to sound more appealing. A study from the Journal of Nonverbal Behavior found that vocal modulation is a key indicator of romantic interest. So if someone sounds different around you compared to how they talk to others, take note.

## 7. They Laugh at Everything You Say (Even Your Bad Jokes)

Laughter is a social bonding tool, and when someone's into you, they're going to laugh at your jokes even when they're not that funny. I'm talking full on giggling at your dumb puns.

This ties into something called ""humor affiliation."" When we're attracted to someone, we want to signal that we enjoy their company and find them entertaining. Laughter creates positive associations and releases feel good chemicals like dopamine and endorphins. If they're laughing more around you than seems normal, they're basically telling their brain, ""I like this person.""

## 8. They Get Nervous or Fidgety Around You

Attraction isn't always smooth. Sometimes it makes people awkward as hell. If someone fidgets with their hair, adjusts their clothes, or seems a little jittery when you're around, that's nervous energy. It means they care what you think about them.

The book The Like Switch by Jack Schafer (former FBI agent) dives into how nervousness and self grooming behaviors are attraction indicators. People primp and fidget because they want to look good for you. It's your brain's way of saying, ""Don't screw this up.""

If you want to go deeper into understanding these patterns and build real social confidence, there's an app called BeFreed that pulls insights from relationship psychology books, dating expert interviews, and behavioral research to create personalized audio learning. 

It generates custom podcasts based on goals like ""become more magnetic in dating"" or ""read social cues better as an introvert."" You control the depth, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive too, including a smoky, conversational tone that makes complex psychology feel like chatting with a smart friend. It's built by Columbia grads and backed by a growing library of dating coaches, communication experts, and peer-reviewed studies.

## 9. They Go Out of Their Way to Be Near You

This one's pretty straightforward but easy to miss. If someone consistently shows up where you are (even when it's not convenient), that's intentional. They take the long route to pass your desk. They happen to be at the same coffee shop. They volunteer for projects you're on.

Proximity is everything in attraction. We're more likely to develop feelings for people we see regularly (it's called the mere exposure effect). If they're engineering situations to be around you, it's because being near you matters to them.

## 10. They Ask Personal Questions and Actually Listen

When someone's attracted, they want to know you. Not just surface level chitchat, but real stuff. They ask about your dreams, your past, your weird hobbies. And here's the key, they actually listen. They follow up on things you told them before. They engage deeply with your answers.

This comes back to investment. People invest time and emotional energy into people they care about. If they're treating conversations with you like they're collecting puzzle pieces to understand who you are, that's attraction.

Here's the thing. Biology, psychology, and evolutionary wiring all play massive roles in how attraction works. These signs aren't guarantees, humans are messy and unpredictable. But if you're seeing multiple signals from this list, chances are high that person feels something.

The real challenge isn't spotting the signs. It's trusting yourself enough to believe them. Stop overthinking. Start noticing. And maybe, just maybe, take the leap and see what happens.",1,1770920970.0,MenInModernDating,0,1.0,False

studied this from like 15+ books, research papers, podcasts (Huberman Lab's episode on social connection is insane), and honestly just observing what makes certain people magnetic. this isn't about manipulation, it's about understanding how human connection actually works so you can stop self-sabotaging.

the thing is, most of our likability issues aren't even our fault. our brains evolved for small tribal groups, not navigating complex modern social dynamics. we're wired to be defensive, self-focused, status-conscious because that kept us alive. but those same instincts now make us insufferable in a coffee shop conversation. the good news? once you understand the psychology, you can work with your brain instead of against it.

**shut up and listen (like actually listen)**

people don't remember what you said, they remember how you made them feel. the fastest way to make someone feel good? genuine curiosity about their life. not the fake ""how was your weekend"" while planning your response. real listening where you're trying to understand their perspective.

[**The Charisma Myth**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11910905-the-charisma-myth) by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks this down perfectly. she's coached everyone from Fortune 500 execs to Stanford students on presence. the book explains how charisma isn't some magical quality, it's just presence + warmth + power. and presence means shutting off that voice in your head critiquing everything and actually focusing on the other person. sounds simple but when's the last time you had a conversation without planning your next clever comment?

technique: ask follow-up questions that show you were actually listening. ""wait so when your boss said that, how did that make you feel?"" instead of ""oh yeah my boss is terrible too let me tell you about...""

**remember their name and use it (sounds cringe but it works)**

Carnegie's old but his **How to Win Friends and Influence People** still hits. there's actual neuroscience behind why hearing our own name activates the brain's pleasure centers. it signals ""this person sees me as an individual, not just another face.""

when you meet someone, repeat their name immediately. ""nice to meet you Sarah"" then use it naturally once or twice in conversation. not every sentence like a psycho, but enough that it registers.

**be warm first, competent second**

we think showing off our achievements makes people like us. wrong. Princeton research shows warmth is evaluated before competence in first impressions. people need to trust you before they care how smart you are.

which means: smile (genuine smiles, the ones that crinkle your eyes), open body language, admit when you don't know something, show vulnerability. [**Daring Greatly**](https://brenebrown.com/book/daring-greatly/) by Brené Brown gets into this, she's spent 20 years researching vulnerability and shame. the book feels like someone explaining why you've been exhausting yourself pretending to have it all together when that's exactly what's pushing people away. vulnerability isn't weakness, it's the thing that makes you relatable instead of that annoying person who humble-brags constantly.

if you want to go deeper on social psychology and communication skills but don't have the energy to read through all these books, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450). it's a personalized learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert insights on topics like social skills and emotional intelligence, then turns them into custom audio episodes. you can set specific goals like ""become more likable in social situations as an introvert"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan based on your unique challenges. 

you control the depth too, a quick 10-minute overview or a 40-minute deep dive with examples when something really clicks. plus you get to pick the voice style, some of them are surprisingly engaging which helps when you're commuting or at the gym. it's helped me connect the dots between all these psychology concepts way faster than trying to plow through book after book.

**mirror subtly (emphasis on subtly)**

we like people who are similar to us. mirroring body language, speech patterns, energy levels triggers unconscious rapport. lean back when they lean back. match their pace, if they're chill don't be manic.

this can feel manipulative but honestly you already do it naturally with people you vibe with. you're just being intentional about it. don't copy every gesture like a mime, just aim for similar energy.

**ask for small favors (backwards but effective)**

Ben Franklin effect: people who do you a favor end up liking you more because their brain justifies ""i wouldn't help someone i dislike, so i must like them."" ask someone for a small favor, thank them genuinely, suddenly they're invested in you.

""hey could you recommend a good coffee shop around here?"" ""do you have a pen i could borrow?"" not massive asks, just small things that let them help you.

**be genuinely happy for their success**

nothing kills likability faster than subtle competitiveness or that forced ""happy for you"" energy when someone shares good news. **Psychologist John Gottman's research** (the guy who can predict divorce with scary accuracy) shows how we respond to good news matters more than how we respond to bad news.

active constructive responding: when someone shares something good, match their enthusiasm, ask questions, celebrate with them. ""that's amazing! how did you pull that off? you must be so proud."" not ""cool. anyway..."" 

**stop trying to be interesting, be interested**

the paradox is trying to seem interesting makes you boring. asking interesting questions makes you magnetic. people leave conversations thinking ""wow they're so easy to talk to"" when really you just let them talk about themselves.

questions that go deeper: ""what's been exciting you lately?"" ""if you could change one thing about your field what would it be?"" ""what's something you believed five years ago that you don't anymore?""

**Insight Timer** (meditation app but has great stuff on social anxiety and presence) helped me get out of my head during conversations. when you're anxious about how you're coming across, you're not present. you're not likable because you're not actually there.

**admit mistakes quickly and with humor**

trying to save face or justify mistakes is exhausting for everyone involved. just own it, ideally with self-deprecating humor, and move on. shows confidence and makes you human.

""yeah i completely misread that situation, i'm an idiot"" with a laugh does more for your likability than 10 minutes of explaining why it wasn't really your fault.

**the gossip rule: only positive or neutral**

negative gossip feels bonding in the moment but research shows people subconsciously associate you with the traits you describe in others. talk shit about someone being lazy? they now associate ""lazy"" with you even though you were criticizing someone else.

compliment people behind their backs. when it gets back to them (and it will) you've just made a friend.

look, none of this is revolutionary. it's mostly just remembering people want to feel seen, heard, valued. we're all walking around desperate for genuine connection but too scared or self-focused to create it. 

the skills are learnable. charisma isn't some genetic lottery, it's mostly just emotional intelligence and getting out of your own way. practice this stuff even when it feels awkward. your brain will adapt, it'll become natural, and you'll notice people responding differently.

anyway that's what worked for me after years of being that tryhard person wondering why conversations felt like pulling teeth.",1,1770920861.0,MensDiscipline,0,1.0,False
1r318h3,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1r318h3/coffee_shop_and_coworking_space_socialization/,Coffee Shop and Coworking space Socialization Question,"I'm trying to validate a project I have, and have seen some posts asking this community about how they meet people if they're trying to connect with others.  If you could make yourself ""visible"" on an app that would allow others in your immediate area know you are open to meeting, would you use it?  For example, if you're working at a coffee shop and have your chess board, you could show in your profile that anyone interested in playing can join you.  Or if you are at a coworking space and could use help with something, you could share that so other users can reach out if they can help.

I've been focusing this project mainly for networking at professional and business events, but want to know if there could be utility here.  One thing I'll share to address some potential concerns is that you can share as much or as little about yourself as you want, including your photo and name.  Safety is a top priority, and users are seen in lists not in a map view.

I'd love your thoughts on if this is something that you can see helping any social needs if others in your area were using it as well.",0,1770920849.0,remotework,1,0.11,False
