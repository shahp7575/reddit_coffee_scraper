Plates stay on the table, conversations wander, phones get ignored for once. That’s the kind of dining space many of us are craving lately.

As we head into **2026**, dining areas are no longer just “where meals happen.” They’ve quietly become:

* Work-from-home corners
* Family bonding zones
* Late-night tea & thinking spots
* A place to slow down

Current home trends are leaning hard into **mindful living**, **quality craftsmanship**, and **warm, grounding finishes**. And honestly? The dining table sits right at the center of that shift.

So here’s a long, cozy, experience-driven list of **15 dining table designs** that genuinely feel right for modern homes in 2026—whether you live in a compact apartment or a big family house..[u/TrendingReddits](https://www.reddit.com/user/TrendingReddits/)

Howdy all! 25M here. Am feeling really lonely this New Year’s Eve but am encouraged to put myself out there now. My new year’s quest is to make more connections and friends.

I’ve complied a list of things I’d like to do / try this year and I’m looking for mates who’d be keen to join me or hang out! I’m thinking this would be a great way to balance work with my outside social life as I was describing in my old post.

Next year Id like to …

•	⁠Have a go at and become competent at bouldering (thinking indoor gym vibe rather than outdoor)

•	⁠Jam more (I sing) and meet some other musicians to potentially write music with

•	⁠Learn to surf

•	⁠Hit up op shops more and thrift more of my wardrobe and household items

•	⁠Develop a further appreciation for coffee and visit heaps of cafes

•	⁠Go to more football (AFL and soccer haha) games

•	⁠Explore new hiking trails and perhaps dabble in a bit of nature photography

•	⁠Progress more in the gym

•	⁠Potentially pick up running again after a few years and join a run club

Alright - this list seems a bit too basic 😅 but it’s a start ! Reach out if you’d like to go one of these adventures or honestly even if something else comes to mind that you think I’d enjoy let me know! While the end of this year has been a lonely one, I’m really keen to be proactive about this next year !",1,1767175836.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

Yesterday we finished a jar of instant coffee, she likes the jars (I don't really understand why) so instead of throwing it away I pulled the label off to clean it up and keep it for her. There was a lot of glue residue left over and she said I should try hot soapy water to get it off. I said I've got some cleaning wipes in the garage that should do it. Later in the evening she came in to the kitchen as I was cleaning the glue off with one of my wipes while I was waiting for the oven to finish. It was taking some effort but it was coming out spotless but she said I should have listened to her it would have been effortless with hot soapy water. I said I was happy doing it my way and showed her how clean it was coming out. She wasn't happy.

I reminded her of a video we watched at the weekend that was aimed at telling both men and women some of the things to do or avoid to help with their marriage (We're going through a tough time at the moment). One of the things aimed at women was: ""Men thrive on appreciation and want to be useful. You have to withhold criticism when he's not doing something the way you would want it done, especially if the outcome is the same. Just appreciate that it was done and be thankful."" I pointed out this is exactly what she was doing now. She thought the whole video was sexist bullshit. I don't think me pointing this out was particularly helpful but she was really upset that I didn't clean the jar the way she wanted and wouldn't drop the subject.

I thought it was all over as she now has the clean jar she wanted and we did manage to get past the subject and be friends again last night, but this morning she wouldn't speak to me. When I gave her a hug she said she was still upset about yesterday, and that I was missing the point. I don't need help understanding her point, I get that she feels like I dismiss her suggestions and ignore her, I just think she's wrong to treat me like this. AITA?",1,1767175819.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

1q09jl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1q09jl5/my_experience_with_expwbpd_bipolar_and_did/,"My Experience with expwBPD, bipolar, and DID (schizophrenia)","Long time lurker and finally feel ready to talk about it. Sorry it’s long, I get if no one reads it.

So I have adhd/autism, cPTSD, and was diagnosed with clinical depression at 8. I have mental health struggles that cause me to isolate and withdraw as I have always had low self-esteem and a very consistent negative outlook on myself and my life. During the lovebombing phase I moved in, I set a boundary that she needs to do therapy consistently, I was in EMDR and self practicing dbt for PTSD. She did one session and the therapist told her she was coping well and she never did another session.

She has DID (schizophrenia), bipolar, and BPD, the crappy thing was that I felt I couldn’t bring up signs of bpd or make new boundaries to protect my own mental health as I 1) wasn’t allowed to since she did one session and was doing fine, and 2) might set off an even more gnarly psychotic episode. I’d hold her through psychotic episodes and sleep three hours as I was having a panic attack and would then be devalued the next day for not doing dishes and making coffee. This escalated until it evolved into full on gaslighting, DARVO, and manipulation. This would often happen during long cyclical arguments when she was feeling emotionally overwhelmed and I would dissociate and try to survive the argument rather than be heard. I was made to apologize for not being okay mentally. I lost friends, my job, and even attempted to take my own life (I’m not actively at risk), the entire time I was told that I’m failing and need to change and I can’t help support her and her overwhelming feelings. I was told that my attempt was manipulative and when I would ask her to “just please be nice to me” she would say that I’m neglecting her and not changing fast enough.

I broke up with her a month after my attempt as the devaluation and gaslighting became so blatant that I couldn’t even wash a bowl of fruit properly without getting talked down to. I attempted to reconnect a month later (fml) and saw the effects of monkey branching and how much she resented me for leaving. My final straw was being gaslighted about the new partner and that she “loves me more” while only wanting to spend 15 minutes around me, telling me we never had good times, all my music sucks, just hurting me in petty ways for the sake of it since I “deserved it”. She’s been blocked on almost everything since then.

A couple weeks ago she messaged me over Spotify (forgot to block on Spotify, because who TF thinks someone will try to reach out over Spotify) and sent a package to my place using her brother in-laws address, the gift was of a show that she belittled me for liking when she split and a poem with hearts on it, and the message was a love song that I sent her on her Spotify wrapped and told me that all her Spotify wrapped songs were from me. I was pissed.

I turned her away while confronting her abuse and shallow apology, she apologized on the surface after mentioning that “she thought I was dead”, but her next message was mocking in tone and almost mocking the pain and anger I was expressing. A week later I checked her instagram (hadn’t until the Hoover) and saw that she was engaged after 7 months to the girl she cheated on me with. I went ballistic and messaged with the intention of hurting her, the fact that she tried to Hoover me back into her life, that she was going to get married AGAIN, with 0 work on herself when she abused me was too much. No idea if she read it and I don’t really care, I’m tired of internalizing a psychotic persons projection and caretaking their mood swings while my own life is falling apart, and being resented and abused for it the whole way through.

And now I’m here with ptsd brain fog, I don’t remember the relationship in full, and I’m trying to work through the gaslighting and brain fog to figure out what my role in all this was, what do I have to do to get better and be a better person? It’s just bullshit that I am the one suffering alone after being abused.

If anyone reads it all the way through thank you, sincerely. Please feel free to message me. I’ve been isolating for around a year so any well wishes or sympathy would be appreciated. We all deserved better.",1,1767175550.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

1q09d0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/HESIexam/comments/1q09d0j/i_passed_my_hesi_yesterday/,I PASSED MY HESI YESTERDAY! 😊,"I passed with a cumulative 90% I scored 100% on A&P. The subjects I had to take were Reading, Vocab, Math, Grammar, and A&P. The resources I used were Nursehub, Nurse Shai, Quizlet, and Smart Edition. 

Studied Nursehub for 3 wks. I took all of the math test in the assignments sections and the last test for the math section on Nursehub. I took all of the grammar lessons and the last test. I did almost all of the last test for Vocab on Nursehub, although it was only 4 words ( Ambivalent, Languid, Lampoon, and overt) from the practice test,  were actually on the my hesi. I skipped reading. I took 8 of the last 10 test on Nursehub practice test for A&P. 

Nurse Shai, was used for my last week reviews before the Hesi. I watched her math videos, vocab, and grammar. The vocab section of the Hesi had maybe 4 words from her video. Ambivalent, Languid, Lampoon, and overt. 

Smart Edition YouTube math videos were very helpful. I definitely seen a lot of the same problems on my Hesi from the videos. There’s two videos for math from Smart Edition. Must watch! 

Quizlet had some very helpful Math that was the same as my hesi word problems. I will list those below. The Quizlet that I will list has Math, Reading, Vocab, and A&P (word for word), all in the same Quizlet. 

For my Hesi, I definitely had a lot of word problems, but they weren’t fraction word problems. The problems were conversion word problems, which weren’t difficult conversions, mostly: volume, length, and liquid. I had a lot of ratios which I know how to do on calculator without writing them down. eg. If you have 2:10::x:5 you look at the two numbers on the opposite side of the x and the number next to the x like ( 2 and 5) you take those two numbers and multiply them then divide by 10! All in the same stroke on the calculator so it should look like this 5x2/10=1 and that’s your answer! Super fast way! I like fast math. 

Hesi vocab section, was nothing like we have studied. It seemed really easy and was more of sentences explaining a definition and asking for the word best for it. The words weren’t large words either. I had a few questions about medical terminology, like anterior and what not. Also misspelled words like deteriorating and medication. Nothing too bad. Lots of context clues! 

Hesi grammar section was super easy! I did not get any indirect objects or adjectives. No predicate nominatives or any of that. Mostly questions like what sentence is using the verb in the correct way. What sentence is grammatically correct. The sentences were about 5 words each. I believe some were from the grammar Quizlet I used as well. 

Hesi reading section, I used Quizlet for sure and a lot was word for word, but make sure you read it yourself because some of the answers are missing from the Quizlet. I had Circus, Food, Coffee, Healthcare, Phobias (there’s 3 phobia answers), Factory, The Golden Gate (answer is not fall to their deaths) Voice, Safe Driving, Rainforest, Alcohol, Exam, Dollar Bill, Insomnia, Olympics, Water Cycle, and Game of Bridge. The passages are extremely short so just make sure to read them.

1q09c5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1q09c5s/i_left_a_note_in_my_apartment_hallway_as_a_joke/,"I left a note in my apartment hallway as a joke, and it accidentally became the reason I didn’t feel alone anymore","When I moved into my new place I was in that phase where I kept telling people I was ""fine"" and technically I wasnt lying. Like I had wifi, I had unpacked maybe three boxes. I had one plate, one fork, and Im pretty sure the spoon was actually from a yogurt cup.

Most nights id eat cereal for dinner. Sometimes just peanut butter on a tortilla standing at the counter. Then id scroll tiktok until my eyes burned and fall asleep to those true crime videos where the guy has a weirdly soothing voice. Just so it wasn't so quiet.

Anyway the building has this elevator thats been ""temporarily out of service"" since like 1987. One night it broke again, shocker, and someone from management taped up a sign:

ELEVATOR OUT OF ORDER (AGAIN). SORRY.

I was having one of those evenings where you feel like you need to do something or youll go insane so I grabbed a sticky note and added underneath:

If you need help with groceries or whatever Im in 3B - Alex

Then immediately thought what did you just do, now youre the weirdo who offers to help strangers. You cant even help yourself.

But whatever, I figured no one would actually knock.

Next evening Im eating more cereal (dinner of champions) and theres a knock on my door.

Its this older guy, maybe late 60s, holding two grocery bags and a case of water bottles. He looks exhausted.

""You Alex?""

""Uh yeah?""

""Dieter. Fourth floor."" He shifts the water case. ""Didnt want to bother you but these stairs are not my friend today.""

So we haul his stuff up. He thanks me. Thats it.

But then the next day someone else knocks. Woman with a stroller and a toddler screaming ""UP UP UP"" on repeat.

Then a college guy with a desk chair still in the box.

Over the next week or so that sticky note somehow turned into a whole thing. People started adding their own notes to the elevator door.

Alex is a real one - 2D

Elevator guy coming Thursday maybe - Management

Someone took my DoorDash AGAIN. I know youre reading this - 4A

Free chair in the lobby if anyone wants it

And then one night I get home from work and theres a new note in really neat handwriting:

If you ever need anything, 1C - Marta

I dont know why but I just stood there staring at it.

Like a week later Im taking trash down at like 11pm, barely awake, and Dieters just sitting on the third floor landing. Not doing anything, just sitting.

""Stairs kicking your ass?"" I ask.

""Nah just taking a break."" He looks at me. ""How you doing Alex? Actually doing.""

""Fine.""

He doesnt say anything, just waits.

And I dont know maybe it was because it was late or because he wasnt being weird about it but I told him the truth.

""Honestly its been kind of strange. First time living alone. I thought id like the quiet more.""

He nods. ""Yeah. Quiets loud isnt it.""

Then after a second he adds ""when my wife died I kept the TV on all the time. Even when I was in the other room. Just needed to hear people talking.""

We just sat there for a minute. Then he got up and said goodnight.

After that things kept happening.

Marta left a bag of clementines by my door with a note, You look like you need vitamin C - M

Someone made a new elevator sign that said DAY 9 WITHOUT ELEVATOR: SOCIETY HAS COLLAPSED. SEND HELP.

Dieter started giving me updates every time I saw him. ""Good news they fixed the railing on five. Were really moving up in the world Alex."" His jokes were not always great but he committed to them.

I started recognizing people. The guy in 2D who was always getting food delivered. The mom with the toddler. A couple on the second floor who argued loudly but not in a scary way.

Nobody ever said were friends now or anything, it just sort of happened.

Last week I had a really long day at work and came home late. The hallway was empty, no one around. No notes on the elevator for the first time in a while.

And I got that feeling again. The one from when I first moved in, the its just you feeling.

Then I saw a post it on my door:

Elevators fixed but were still doing coffee Thursday 6:30 in the lobby. Youre coming - Marta

I dont even really like coffee and Im not great at small talk. And I kind of wanted to just go inside and eat cereal and watch youtube.

But Im probably going to go.

I dont know, I guess Im just realizing that everyone in this building was probably doing the same thing I was, pretending they were fine, eating random stuff for dinner, trying to figure out how to be a person.

And maybe that sticky note didnt fix anything but at least now when I hear someone in the hallway I dont feel like Im the only one here.",8,1767174781.0,stories,5,1.0,False

2. Taste was visibly different, and a non-coffee drinking friend who doesn’t know left from right preferred the Neo.

Heyyy,

I am 27 F living in Germany but I speak French and English also. 

I grew up in France but moved to Germany last year in August.

I love swimming and I'll also be going to gym. I swim 2-3 times a week and I generally just swim freestyle or breastroke. 

I like to listen to music and in general I am just really chill. 

I honestly just like to take care of myself so I know a lot about skincare. I also like to do some cute makeup looks and I've been just trying to change my fashion style.

I've been thinking about getting a tattoo so you could help me with choosing a tattoo ;P.

I do have a highschool diploma but I dropped out of university because I didn't like my studies. I am thinking about getting another degree next year but I have to think about what I really like and it's really difficult.

I also love coffee but I've kinda had a coffee addiction so I forced myself to fight against this addiction and I've been successfully able to lower my daily coffee intake.

I am just looking for somebody to chat to on a daily basis.
I love to make jokes. And of course I don't want to talk to some creepy guy and I'll not be sending nudes

I’m 15 and I have a boyfriend but recently we haven’t been so good… but I have to get into why. Some days I feel like I’m the problem or something. I consider breaking it off but I just need help. I’m constantly saying saying sorry. Okay to the point now. This all happened day before thanksgiving of this year. So me and and boyfriend are so what active but that night we had done it at his house he went to go take out the trash and throw away the condom or whatever and he comes back into the room and instantly his mom calls him and she’s always calling him for something so I just stayed in his room waiting for him but 20 minutes go by and he’s still not back. So I head into the living room and he has the condom wrapper in his handsome and his mom looks at me saying I’m not having sex with her son for the next 40 years and she starts going crazy. I don’t know what my boyfriend had told her already so I went along and said that we only talked about it and said that we wanted to wait for a while. But who wants to tell their boyfriends mom they are doing it. And she starts yelling at me and all she knows is that we didn’t do it that night but she was so pissed I was crying because I fold reqlly easy under pressure or just people yelling in general. My dad is a really bad alcoholic and my parents used to fight bad so I just can’t handle it with all the trauma. And so my mom comes to his house to come pick me up but I’m still trying to figure out things out with his mom and trying to see if she’s gonna tell my mom or not but then she’s like I’m not gonna tell your mom that’s up to you or whatever to tell your mom to be grown about her or something and then his mom has a girlfriend and her girlfriend was like I don’t know what else to say other than you guys just didn’t do it and it didn’t happen so I don’t think his mom should be mad right now and that’s what her girlfriend said his stepmom anyway so I was just trying to figure out if she would tell my mom or not so I was still in the house for 30 minutes talking to his mom about stuff and my boyfriend is just sitting there not saying anything and I just felt so embarrassed in everything you know and his sister was right there and I told her that he you should go to your room because I don’t want his sister up in my business and everything OK fast forward to Thanksgiving day. He calls me in the morning and he’s like hey and I’m like hey and he’s like my mom knows everything and I didn’t know what he meant by everything so I just played along with it and I guess he told her that we did do it that night and she starts going off about how I disrespected her house which I completely understand and all of this and my boyfriend was supposed to come with me to my family‘s house for Thanksgiving too, but he didn’t end up coming because his parents are so unreliable with rides and everything but anyways, my mom was really mad that she was waiting in the car for 30 minutes because I was trying to talk to my boyfriend‘s mom trying to figure everything out and I was crying really bad and we just told my mom that I was throwing up and so my mom told me that I’m not going to his house for a while because I made her wait for so long which is understandable because I would be so mad if my kid was just in their goofing around or doing whatever you know. Anyways, he told me if I didn’t go to his house for Thanksgiving that his mom said it would be so much worse and that she needed to talk to me and anyways first word my mom lets me go over to go have Thanksgiving dinner with his family and I’m at the door I knock and his mom opens it and she hugs me really tightly like too tightly. You know too tight to be a nice welcoming hug she said best believe we’re gonna be talking tonight and my boyfriend had told me that we weren’t gonna talk tonight because this Thanksgiving and who wants to talk about the stuff you know on Thanksgiving like enjoy your holiday and everything but she told me no we’re talking tonight and so I’m in my boyfriend‘s room freaking out because like I don’t know what to tell her so I don’t know what he told her pretty much and anyways I’m just like freaking out like sobbing my eyes out cause I’m so stressed out cause I folded under pressure easily with stress and everything and his mom just yells a lot and I can’t deal with the yelling but anyways she comes in the room and she’s like I don’t hate you. I hope you know that and I’m like yeah and and she’s like yeah well we can talk as soon as you’re writing. I’m like just give me some time and I’m like I don’t want yelling. I don’t want anything. Please understand that like I will have a panic attack and it won’t be good and anyway anyways she just sees that I’m stressing out and my boyfriend’s not doing anything and then she starts speaking Spanish to him she’s like where’s your love at who’s your love blah blah blah and then she starts to slap him like slap the shit out of him heart leaving marks on his face and now he sobbing and he’s crying and everything and I’m just holding him on like it’s OK I’m sorry it’s OK. I’m sorry like everything and then his mom is like OK let’s talk and I was like OK let’s go and so we went into her room and I was sitting on this little chair and she’s just sitting in front of me and then she just starts talking shit to me and calling me names like a thot and just use such vulgar language for a situation like this, you know and said that I could “fuck her son everyday and how she is always going to be his first love” which this lady is completely crazy to me and everything and then she slaps my boyfriend so hard to the point that he has so many marks on his face and he’s pulling back and she’s like don’t you effing pull back and she slapped him harder and then she’s calling me even more names like a hoe and a whore mind you we are still young too, and I shouldn’t be called these names and she’s like I don’t know if you’re experienced or not but blah blah blah if I told my son to break up with you right now he would and I’m like OK like this ladies obviously taking it to the extreme level and it was like this whole thing and she was just like I was graduated from high school and already had my stuff for nursing by the time I was your age, but the fact is that she doesn’t do anything for herself and she lives in a three bedroom apartment with 10 people living there she wants to tell me all of this stuff but she hasn’t done anything for herself in mind you I had to complete and most respect for this lady, but she call me names and she’s a grown lady and I feel like that should’ve happened and she said a lot more things to me that night and slap my boyfriend so hard and I just can’t watch that abuse until I got up and like went in front of her when she was about to slap him and she like you move out of my fucking way anyways so we get done talking and my mom said on one condition I could go over if I had a ride back to my house. My mom said I had to be home before 11 or 11 o’clock on the dot and so I was like OK thank you Mom that gave me two hours to hang out with my boyfriend you know and his dad was supposed to drive me home and I like how I said my dad‘s an alcoholic my dad drove me drunk the last time I saw him so I was really freaked out because he picked me up from school and he we went on the highway and he was just swerving all over. He smelled like beer he was you know just really intoxicated and so when I saw a shot glasses by his dad and drinks and stuff I was like no I will call my mom right now to come pick me up and my boyfriend was like no no like we promised your mom that you would have a ride back home no I don’t do this and his mom‘s like you better. Tell her that your dad is OK to drive which reminds you his dad was completely drunk and just you know he couldn’t even like keep his eyes open while he was like trying to like do anything you know like just sitting there at the table? He’s slumped over and so I started freaking out and I’m like I don’t wanna drive please like I’ll call my mom. It’s OK and then his mom‘s like this whole thing and start slapping my boyfriend again and then his uncle said that he could take me home and I was like thank you and then his wife or his girlfriend his aunt was like oh no you’re gonna have me watching your fucking child but I know fuck you and it turned into this whole fight and I was like seriously like his family isn’t like mine. I grew up completely different from him. He’s been through it. I haven’t, but it’s just the fact that his family just act so immature about situations like me and my boyfriend were in a quinceanera and my boyfriend had given one of the guys hit off of his yart and that guy pretty much greened out and he was like the main guy of the event, but that boy‘s mother went up to my boyfriend‘s mom and was like what the F blah blah blah and then my boyfriend‘s mom wanted to act like she was like a little and that she wasn’t ghetto or anything and you know and they were talking about pressing charges and then his mom just stresses about stuff so much anyways, but his dad was supposed to drive me home, but he was obviously drunk and I didn’t want to get in and she started slapping him and she said you better tell your girlfriend that it’s OK to drive your dad and I said no her name ____ my dad is an alcoholic. I can’t drive with people that have drink in. Please know please know I have so much trauma please I can’t. I can’t. I just can’t do it please and she said bitch what the fuck are you trying to say you’re trying to call my family an alcoholic in this whole thing and this lady just really stepped over the line with that and that’s where I just lost all my respect for her and my mom didn’t know anything or didn’t even know this was happening, but I came home crying and sobbing because his instead of swerving all over the road and I was just so stressed out and you know and so I walked in the door my mom’s like what happened and I’m like pretty much. Her name ____ just called me some names and just told me what the fuck I was talking about and was just assuming things and everything and that she doesn’t understand anything with my dad‘s drinking and when I first met his mom, I was like yeah, like my dad has a really like bad drinking problem like he’s a really bad alcoholic, you know and she just pushed it up to the side and said everybody had a little problem with alcohol, which is not OK just to brush my feelings aside or anything. It’s my stuff but the second it comes to her. It’s like oh the world comes crashing down or whatever and I realize that she’s just a lot you know it’s a person my boyfriend‘s mom is and yeah anyways but my mom was just like seriously what the heck so that all happened on Thanksgiving day which is obviously a Thursday Friday rolls around nothing much and then I was supposed to  get my period on Thanksgiving day but when I’m under a lot of stress or I’m just not doing too well mentally my period skips a few days or skips a week or something because of my stress levels and everything so I was already stressed out from this situation and how is Mom talked to me and how she was screaming when I told her that I didn’t not want her to be screaming and how she slapped him and everything and so on Friday night, I had texted my friend and she agreed to pick me up Saturday afternoon to go get pregnancy test because me and my boyfriend were active a few times before and his mom just really scared the pregnancy thing into me and so I just told my boyfriend like oh me and my friend are just gonna go hang out and go get lunch and then he calls me Saturday morning and was like my mom said you need to come over now or when your friend picks you up and I was like no my friend is not picking me up to go to your house when we have plans and everything and he’s like OK. Well my mom said that she’s going to your house then and I’m like no I’ll just go over because my mom didn’t know anything at the time and I didn’t want her to and so I get over to his house and he his mom‘s like I know that you guys did it another time, blah blah blah, and I was like OK and then she made me go in the bathroom and take a pregnancy test, but she stayed in the bathroom and watched me pee into the cup like my legs are wide open and everything and so I just felt really like humiliated because she’s watching me and she’s a ground woman and everything and I’m a little girl I feel like that was really weird and my period also still wasn’t there so she was just really mad but the test turned out negative like I thought they were and then she starts going off like oh you’re gonna come back in two weeks and I’m gonna test you again and if you’re pregnant, I’m telling your mom and I’m like you just need to give me a second you know and I was pretty much it so me and my friend laughed and then that was it and then I’m texting my boyfriend later that night and he’s not responding and then he tells me that he ended up telling his mom everything like when we first did it and you know like other stuff and I was just like seriously like why didn’t he tell me but this whole situation he’s thrown me under the bus and so I start freaking out again and I just anxiety freak and you know an anxiety is the worst trait of me and I’m trying to get better with a through meditation and through manifestation and other things, but I just you know got scared again and just started thinking the worst things again cause his mom was just really rude. She’s like practically spitting in my face anyway anyways next day rolls around he’s not texting me as much and I’m like hey hello like where are you like? Can you just be here for me like I need support like I feel like I’m the one that’s getting mostly blamed here which I understand but it’s just like a lot and can you like just help me you know like help me feel like you love me you know like help me feel like you’re here for me and then he is just like whatever you’re just always trying to cause fights and I’m like no I’m not. I’m just asking you for one thing and then he was like whatever and I’m like call me cause I’m not gonna deal with a guy that’s gonna be acting like this my mom put up with my dad‘s bullshit for so many years so I know that I’m not gonna deal with something if somebody’s not gonna talk to me correctly or if somebody’s not gonna treat me correctly you know and then he’s like oh like I just wanna break up and then I was like let me talk to your mom and his mom starts talking about more shit and she’s not even helping with the situation and then shit you’re causing my son so much stress and I’m like OK whatever she’s like you’re about to lose a blah blah blah she says their last name she’s like once a last name is halfway out the door they just fully leave and I’m like OK whatever you know like I didn’t want to hear this like I was coming for you for advice not just to get yelled at again and called names again and everything and so me and him ended up breaking up that night for literally eight minutes and then he texted me. I can’t do this without you and so we got back together and then that whole week was just like you know like what the heck and since I was really stressed out, I didn’t get my period but that same night on Sunday I did get my period and his mom didn’t believe me and so she had me sent over a picture of my bloody pad and a bloody toilet paper swipe you know cause she didn’t believe me and she’s a grown woman and this is also why I said she lost all my respect because of all of this you know I was OK that she found out all of this and everything. Thursday rolls around I’m just under so much stress and I’m just not sleeping good at my mom has that really good intuition and she’s really spiritual of stuff and other things he can hear things and can’t see the future like not future but can just tell stuff you know and I woke up from a nap and I was like oh my gosh and she’s like what happened and I’m like there’s something I want to tell you, but I’m not ready to tell you yet you know and she’s like oh she said my boyfriend’s name should I think you guys are having sex and I said yes, but I didn’t tell her anything about his mom knowing it how she went psycho and screaming and slapping and everything. I only told her that she just said some things about me saying something about his dad and my dad, being drunk or alcoholics or whatever and my mom was just really upset you know, but she did the mature thing like she only knew that we did it once and when his mom found out they’ll be did it once his mom went crazy, but my mom just sat there thinking and asked me questions and was mature about it and wasn’t even talking about him not even thinking about him until the very end, it started asking me stuff and everything you know, but I only told her that we did at once and that was all and my mom was like look me and your dad are going through this divorce. I’m gonna let you do whatever you want, but whatever you think you’re a punishment should be, but the thing is my mom. She was just really confused you know and she went outside to go take her smoke break and she came back in. It’s the next morning for school and she has to drive me to school. That’s 20 minutes from where I live and so we’re driving and she’s like you didn’t put your phone on my table like I asked and I’m like OK well you said I could do whatever I want and she’s like yeah well I still want you to listen to me. You know when my mom‘s always just been there for me and she’s always just listen to me and she’s always had my best interest. She’s like I know but you’re too young to be doing this and you know my mom handled the situation in a mature way and after school, she picked me up and then we got coffees and I paid for them cause I do stuff on the side and so I just paid for our coffees and stuff and then I’m just like laying down on the couch just thinking you know and she calls me up to do some tarot cards with her and we’re talking and I get this one card and I was just like the 10 of swords I think and it’s when you’re just having constant nightmares or somethings weighing you down and stuff so my mom‘s like this is what’s weighing you down you know anyway anyways but my mom handled the situation maturely did what she needed to do with me right anyways I told my boyfriend that I told my mom but only told her that me and him did it once and not that his mom knows at all or anything and he starts stressing out on whatever and I’m like it’s fine like it’s OK and he’s like if we need to break up again then that’s fine like whatever you wanna do and I’m like what like why are you even thinking about that? You know he’s I don’t know but the last time when we broke up, he said I was bashing him and I was always trying to cause fights and I wasn’t doing him good and so anyways, Saturday rolls around and I wake up and I’ve been sick since October and it’s already December and he was like hi good morning baba blah like what are your plans and I’m like hi I’m gonna go ge call me t IV and he’s like OK and he was taking like two hours to respond at a time and I was like hey call me and he was like why and I’m like just call me and he called me and I was like hey like what do you think is going on with us like you’re taking forever to respond I’m just asking you just to answer my text or just you know and he’s just like I don’t know he’s like I think I’m losing feelings and I’m like seriously like you’re like. Hurting me, you know and I was like OK I’m like I’m not begging you to stay with me.

I’m not doing anything so we broke up and we broke up for a day and he messaged me Sunday night and we get back together and everything and actually everything starts going good again and then the next week which is a Monday I asked if he could come talk to my mom about this whole situation you know just she just wants to set boundaries and stuff. My mom isn’t gonna yell at him or slap them or anything like how his mom did but my mom just wanted to set boundaries and so I was like hey do you think you can come over tomorrow or today to come talk to my mom and he starts talking about how he wants his mom there but my mom told me that she doesn’t want his mom there and she thinks that she’s too immature to have a conversation about this stuff and thinks you know, but my mom doesn’t know anything about the other stuff but my mom already knows that like it would be such a bad idea just to have her there and he was like no I’m bringing my mom and I’m like no it was this whole thing and he’s just like talking to me badly and I’m just like whatever I’m not dealing with this and so I just told him like I always feel sorry every time I talk to you. I feel like I’m the one to blame you. I feel like everything is my fault because you make me feel like it like it shouldn’t be my fault because it was both of our decisions and everything you know I’m like I’m not gonna stick with you here for you to say things to my face or say mean things to me you’re ignore me or anything. I’m not dealing good things like I’m sorry anyways we ended up seeing each other later that week on a Saturday for a date cause we hadn’t seen each other for three weeks, which is a lot you know cause he’s just trying to avoid stuff and his mom is literally crazy anyways that day it went pretty good just yeah fast forward to now today my dog I had to go take him to the vet and me and my boyfriend like we don’t call as much as we used to.

New here… but let me premise this with the understanding that for the last month I’ve been scouring the posts trying to figure out what I’m doing wrong.

I’ve had a Baratza Encore ESP and Bambino Plus for close to a month and my espresso is just awful. Some shots are drinkable with milk, but none on their own or god forbid without sugar!

I’ve tried 3 different beans (250g bags), all from Italian speciality roasters. All fresh within roast date parameters. Medium Roast to Dark,single origin from Mexico and Brazil, and an Arabica/Robusta blend from Brazil, Nicaragua and Guatemala. All properly stored I might add.

My puck prep is pretty decent. Dose varies depending on roast level.  On average 17g to 18g in (double single walled stock basket with stock porta filter), WDT, stock tamper and Razor tool used to ensure correct headspace.  Preheating group head and porta filter. Purging between shots and even tried purging steam from wand as suggested in one post prior to pulling a shot. Pulling a manual shot with 8 seconds pre infusion and hitting targets of between 25 and 35 seconds for target yields of 1:2 ratios. Even tried 1:5 and 1:75 ratios. Would love to understand if it’s just my palate that’s off or if there is some coffee related conspiracy that I’m unaware of, lol! Can’t even get a decent dial in to do a salami shot to understand if it’s me or something else.

Grind size on the Encore ESP between 14 and 17 on the ESP range.  (Bambino Plus close to choking on 14) Started with recommended 15, to attempt dialling in.  Purging between grind sizes correctly and single dosing.

Water used is filtered. I’m in the process of buying a TDS meter to check that too. Water temp cannot be adjusted on the Bambino Plus.

I’m in northern Italy if that helps with any recommendations for additional accessories that I might need. I’m looking for a decent 54mm bottomless porta filter that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg and that will fit without issues.

What in the heck am I doing wrong? I’m exasperated! What am I missing?

1q091mn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1q091mn/i_live_in_a_house/,I Live In A House,"I live in a house made entirely of glass. Every surface—the walls, roof, floor, furniture, decor, even the plumbing and wiring—is glass. And it’s all on the verge of shattering. The things contained within, pressing against the glass and stressing every surface, continue to grow, multiplying wildly like rabbits. Their emotions are in constant, rapid flux—a chaos I am starting to lose control of.

Despite its composition, you cannot see into the house from the outside, nor can you see out from the inside. To the average observer, it appears to be a normal house. From the interior, looking out, the world is dark. Only soft gray outlines and fluttering winds are visible, barely helping to discern what is directly in front of me.

Inside, I shake like a terrified dog, my tail tucked. I don’t want to move, open my eyes, breathe, or eat. I just want it all to shatter and dissipate. From the outside, the house is quiet; from the inside, it’s a din of roaring screams and cries that howl endlessly. When someone rings the doorbell, I can barely hear it.

“...Payton!” A scratchy voice snaps me out of my daze. I lift my head from the diner counter. Standing across the shiny silver counter, hand on her hip, is an impatient old woman. Her skin and teeth are stained almost entirely yellow from a lifetime of cigarettes, and she always radiates a faint smell of tobacco. The cute, blue-and-white striped waiter dress sharply contrasts with her wrinkled, spotted skin, which is always dry, damaged, and bruised. She used to be an addict.

“How many times do I gotta tell you this ain’t no bar. You can’t be comin’ in here gettin’ wasted like this!” Frustrated, she runs a hand through her thin gray hair, looking as if she’s about to shed her skin. “You’re lucky ain’t nobody come in here no more. It’s all just delivery apps and shit like that. But we still got regulars, and you’re scaring them off!”

“I’m not drunk, Ms. Apple.” She places a coffee in front of me as I speak. I grab the coffee and look longingly into the steaming surface. It's nearly black, the milk old and coagulating, refusing to mix with the drink. I swirl the cup once or twice, hoping to mix it, but the chunks of old milk float to the sides, then spread back across the surface when the little whirlpool settles.

“Who the fuck is Ms. Apple? How many times I gotta tell you I’m Barb?” B-A-R-B, Barb.” She sasses me, before walking away towards the back to do something. I can hear her still continuing her sass through the thin walls that separate the kitchen and the diner. “How many times I gotta tell you, you ain’t got the damn right to call me that anymore!”

“I’m sorry…” I mumbled. I took a sip of the coffee, the chunks of old milk grossly slipping between my lips. Her sass quieted and I could hear the sounds of pots and pans clanking, the fridge opening and closing, the mere sounds of her movements spelt anger clearly. But quickly the smell of morning began to permeate the air, and an odd calmness blanketed the diner. 

Ms. Apple isn’t her real name; it is Barbara. And she hates when I call her such now. But it’s such a habit, I’ve been calling her that since I was a kid. It wasn’t until a few years ago she started hating the name, hating me. 

She earned the nickname when I was a kid because of the amount of apple pie she ate. I’d been coming to this stuck-in-time diner since I was six. She was always so kind to me, often sitting with my father and me during her lunch break. Her lunch break was always apple pie and water, nothing else. We always joked she was going to turn into an apple from the amount of apple pie she ate, which coined the nickname. I can't remember if it was me, my father, or her who first said it.

She finishes whatever task she was doing and returns to the counter in front of me.

“You ever thought about going to rehab?” She hands me a note with a phone number on it and a plate loaded with various breakfast foods, some overcooked, a little burnt, and some a little undercooked.  “It helped me…”

A moment of silence passes between us. I just stare at the number, reading it from left to right, over and over again.

(207) 555-0184

“Look, just consider it, kid.” She walks over to the nearby register and begins to close out for the night. “Eat the food I made ya, finish your damn coffee, and then get the hell out of my sight.”

“The milk is expired.” I inform her. She knew.

The walk home is harsh. The wind stings my hands and face, and even through my thick winter clothes, I can feel my body starting to freeze. A heavy rain is predicted. I contemplate letting myself stay out in the rain once it starts, to *really* freeze. You always hear about drowning being somehow peaceful, but if you read into it, it’s painful—your lungs fill with water, you begin to panic, and your body shuts down. It sounds scary.

But I’ve heard that dying of hypothermia is somehow peaceful. The beginning may be painful, but at some point, as death sets in, it’s like falling into an endless sleep. You get so cold that your body actually starts to believe it's hot. You grow tired as your body slows down, and eventually, you lull into that endless slumber. Then again, it would be slow. I’d be out in the freezing rain and wind for too long. And to reach that odd peaceful end, I’d suffer more than anything else. And then, the suffering I’d inflict upon others…

I arrive home just as the rain begins. My old, wooden shack stands resolutely despite its age, haphazardly plopped down in the port town without rhyme or reason. It’s away from the main neighborhoods, situated instead on the main street leading to the harbor. It has two floors, an attic, and a small, round window placed just slightly off-center between the slopes of the particularly pointy roof—or perhaps it’s the roof that’s off-center, not the window. The only sign of life around the house is a tree growing in my small front yard, its branches nearly touching the second-floor bedroom window. The grass in my little yard hasn’t grown in years, no matter the time of year.

I walk up the zigzagging path that leads to my little screened porch. It curves and sharply cuts for no particular reason: first to the right, softly left, then sharply and suddenly right again. Then, five steps up to a steep final step into the porch. The wind blows the flimsy door open for me, as if welcoming me home. I never lock the porch door, only the main entry door to my house.

I enter the porch and maneuver around some poorly placed furniture to reach the front door. There is no rhyme or reason to any of the decor in the porch, no reason for how the coffee table sits oddly close to the center, or how the couch is too far from it. I think the delivery men just left it like that, and I was too unmotivated to move them. The only thing with a purpose is a little rack next to the front door, which houses a few pairs of shoes meant for gardening or work, yet those shoes remain untouched, except by spiders and stray mice seeking warmth during the colder days. I don’t garden, and my work is far from dirty.

Unlocking the front door is always a challenge; the old, thick wood door is constantly warping, making the way to unlock it inconsistent throughout the year. While unlocking, you’d have to pull or push, sometimes neither, jiggle the door around, and eventually, the lock moves with a loud “*THUNK*” and the door is unlocked. Today, however, I don't have to do anything. There is no challenge; I don't have to fumble with the lock and the door. It just opens.

The foyer feels so empty. Flicking on the lights, they don’t glow as usual. That soft, warm glow of the old lights isn't there to comfort me on my arrival home. I toss my keys from my pocket into a little clay bowl on a rotting side table. I stare at it, wondering when the table will finally give way, give up. I look away, kick my shoes off, and begin to make my way through my home.

All the doors to each room are closed. Passing the kitchen and dining, the door is closed. Passing the living room, the door is closed. The bathroom, the hall closet—all the first-floor rooms are closed. I never leave them closed; there's no reason since it's only me in my tiny little home. Nobody is wandering about my house but me, nobody is peeking at what I'm doing. The only creaks of the floor are beneath my own steps, the only time someone knocks is when I drop something.

I can barely see in the dark halls, due to all the doors being closed, the windows that usually would allow light to leak into the hallways couldn’t do so. But I’ve wandered this path so many times I could do it blind. I know which picture frames stick out a little too much so I wouldn’t knock them with my shoulders. I know where the few cabinets are, holding nothing but air in their drawers, dust on their surfaces. I even know which floorboards are squeakier than others. I like to step on them sometimes, the sound echoing through my home's tight halls, making me feel a little less alone.

The second floor is just the same. Oddly, all the doors, except my bedroom door, are closed. I never really go into the other ones anyway—extra rooms now only used for storage. Nobody comes to visit me anymore. Not my family, not my friends, only house spiders and the occasional mouse that decided the boots outside weren't warm enough. 

My room holds everything I care about: all the books I’ve collected, old gifts and knick-knacks from those I still love, from those who no longer love me. But more so, my room holds more of what I *don’t* care about. Overdue bills, random old notices and explanations of things and places I no longer own or live at, and papers upon papers of old work that have become meaningless, outdated. My closet is filled with dirty and torn clothes that I’ll never replace; if it still covers what it needs, why waste my time replacing them?

I make my way to my lonely single bed, centered against the back wall, parallel to the door. Without taking off the day’s clothes, I flop down on the stiff mat with more of a *smack* than a soft *whump*.

It had been another day wasted. The only things I had done were going to the same job and working the same register, going to the same diner and passing out in the same seat as always, and then taking the same path home to just pass out one more time before I have to get up and do it all over again. I let out a deep sigh, my breath heating my pillow. At least I didn’t drink today.

I lean up on my elbow and reach over to my nightstand, grabbing my pills. It’s a fresh bottle, taking a little more effort to pop open. I dump a good amount into my hand, covering my palm with a little hill of red, chalky pellets. Maybe about half of the three months' supply is right there in my hand. I fumble the pills around as they rustle and crinkle against each other.

I take what I need with some lukewarm water that has been sitting on my nightstand for a while, close up the bottle, and thump my head back down onto my pillow again. I look back over at my nightstand. A dusty picture of a young girl stares at me. She has a big old grin on her face, snot running out her nose, winter clothes a size too big for her, resting floppy on her tiny frame. The predicted heavy rain begins, and I quickly drift off to the sound of the storm outside, staring into the little girl's eyes, desperately trying to remember what her laugh sounded like.

Inside my glass house, I awake on my glass bed. Everything is near ready to shatter, every surface like an intricate spiderweb shining in the morning sun. Some loose glass shards on the surface of my bed poke me through my clothes. My back is bleeding lightly, soaking various spots on the back of my clothes.

Normally, there would be chaos within these walls. The things I’ve tried to keep in for so long, pressing hard on the walls in hopes of getting out, breathing down my back, their hot breath sweating my skin—the ones molting like tarantulas in the darkest corners, I could watch them grow, and the foul ones I could watch mate and breed, spreading more of their darkness in this shattering home. But they are not there. It is all quiet throughout the glass house.

For the first time, I manage to walk out the door to my room. But I remain cautious. All the doors in the house are closed; only the door to my room is open. I can feel a presence behind them, a growing beast breathing heavily, stalking me. I can feel the eyes upon my body, but I can’t see through the glass walls.

The crunch of the glass beneath my feet, like stepping on dry leaves, rings out and rattles every single surface of my glass house. The sound causes some of the loose fragments to fall to the floor, their impact loosening other fragments that were yet to fall from their place, still just barely holding on—that little push from such a small piece of glass was all they needed to break.

I continue my slow walk down the steps to the first floor, trying to carefully step so the glass wouldn’t pierce my bare feet, but even with my meticulous movements, I can't keep the shards from stabbing my soles. My back already turned to Swiss cheese from sleeping on the bed, and now so are my feet from the steps I’m taking. But it doesn’t really feel like anything, my caution is pointless.

I arrive at the front door, and it is wide open. I could have sworn I closed it behind me when I came in. It wouldn’t be the first time I had forgotten to close my front door, and it was never too much of an issue anyway. Outside of young teens egging a house or shop every now and then, that was as bad as crimes got around my town. Of course, having crimes meant people had to be outside, and that was never the case.

But, somehow, staring at my front door, it feels like I had never opened it, nor closed or forgotten to not close it. I feel I never touched it. Somehow, this is the first time I have worried, having my door wide open. I step through the open door into the cold night.

The rain has stopped, but the cold wind still runs up and down the street, passing onto my little glass porch. The wind quickly crisps my nose, turning it red, and my fingers turn purple beneath and around the nails. I shove my hands under my armpits for warmth, but it doesn't matter. I can't really feel the cold from the air, or the warmth from my body.

I quickly peek around, searching for someone, something, anything despite the darkness. But there is none. I turn back around and re-enter my glass home. Slowly closing the door behind me, I turn around to lock it. The lock has no struggles once more as I turn the little knob to lock it. And with a soft *clink*, a rain of glass falls around me; the whole house has finally shattered.

And with the falling rain of glass, so too fall the beasts, the things that resided within my glass house. Their contorting and twitching bodies take hefty strides toward the darkest corners of my little town. Their erotic howling, sad wails, and angry shouts spread quickly like a rolling fog across the main street.

And all I can do is be that scared little dog, his tail tucked between his legs. Even as they run away from me, their bodies finding every single tight corner and open room to infect with their disease, I can feel them staring at me, right next to me. Their necks are elongating to keep their disgusting faces right before me, all around me, surrounding me in a bubble, as their chaos, their pain, their hunger, spread across the world around me.

I don’t want to open my eyes, I don’t want to look at any of them, any of their disgusting faces, I couldn’t face them. I feel so much fear, and so much shame, I begin to bawl like a baby, my breath hastening as the tears fall from my eyes like the surging waters of the Niagara. I shake intensely, tightening my hands into fists, my knuckles white, my nails digging into my palms until they bleed, and the nails sting like wasps.

They sting. I can feel the stinging, and I can begin to feel the harsh winter winds and the scrapes and stabs along my back and feet from the glass. The scrapes along my whole body, caused by the falling glass around me. And I can feel their hot, labored breaths; I can feel their spit as they shout at me; I can feel their tears fall on top of me. I can feel it all.

I shoot awake in the darkness of my room. My bed is wet, a mixture of tears, sweat, and blood. The storm is still raging outside. My palms are gashed, some of the skin stuck underneath my nails. With my bloodied palms, I wipe the thick tears from my eyes, clearing my vision. My breath slows, and I calm.

But my calm doesn’t last long, for through the open door, at the end of the dark hallway, a hulking fog stares at me, its many glowing eyes coating its  whole body like scales, fading in and out of its shape, all staring directly at me.

For a moment, we stare deep at one another. My panicked breaths begin to return, and just as fear sets into me, it slithers away, down the steps, not making a single sound. I watch its figure quickly fade as it moves deeper into the darkness of my home.",1,1767173619.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

Then came the disaster… grind adjustment was 20 and the extraction on the first espresso took more than 40sec - it was overextracted. 

Second try: grind adjustment 60, only droplets of coffee came out while extracting. 

Third try: grind adjustment on 10, nothing came out for 30 seconds!! 

What am I doing wrong? Or does the spinspro have any influence? But how? It only turns the axis so how could it influence anything? 

Side note: everything else was the same as usual, same comandante, same beans, same tamper etc.",1,1767173605.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

It was in the middle of summer and I had just gotten out of the clinic after having congestion problems with my ears. It was hot and I didn't want to stay in a room full of people coughing so I decided to walk across the street to this Dunkin to wait for my ride. Moment I walked in the place was empty and dirty.

There were only two people in that place, the barista and (I fuck you not!) a sketchy guy in a baseball cap, a hoodie (with the hood on) hunched over his laptop. I'm almost 90% certain, that man was looking at porn because the moment I walked in, he gave me this shifty look and turned his computer screen away from me. (Part of me was praying to God he was hacking the mainframe but deep down I knew it was probably porn).

I stand by the machine for a few minutes to cool off (because again the tables were dirty as hell) and I only talked to the barista one time to ask for the time since my phone just died. After a few minutes I was really to order a drink. But before I could even get a fucking word out the barista looks at me and says I need to get the fuck out. Before I can even ask why she said apparently I was acting STRANGE and SKETCHY, and that I was making them feel uncomfortable for asking them QUESTIONS?! (I only asked for the fucking time! What other questions did I ask?!)

Anyways they said they were going to call the cops on me, so instead of arguing I just grabbed my shit and left, knowing full well they kicked me out over the guy who was 100% gooning at one of their tables (and before you ask yes there were dirty napkins in balls next to him).

Literally felt like a fever dream. That Dunkin needs to change their slogan to ""Dunkin' free Wi-Fi for pervin'!"" Never went back to that place again. Hope this lives rend free in your head lol",1,1767173530.0,offmychest,4,0.66,False

I bought some coffee beans from a cafe and they were able to grind them in-store for me. It seems they've ground them too fine as I get no flow at all when trying to pull a shot.

I'm using a dual walled two cup filter and I tried reducing the dose gradually down to 14g and also using less tamp pressure, but every time I get absolutely no flow. Is it because the espresso is too fine or is something else wrong?

I've read about using a single walled portafilter for freshly ground beans (which I guess they kind of are as it was only 12hrs ago) but not sure if this would solve anything.
Thank you",2,1767173526.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

There are towns that teach you how to disappear without ever leaving.

Casper Creek was one of them.

It sat low in the land, fields sagging toward it from every direction, the roads bending inward like they did not want to go anywhere else. Corn grew tall but thin, the stalks brittle by August. Soybeans yellowed early. People said the soil was tired, like it had given all it could and was still being asked for more.

My grandmother used to say the land listened.

“Treat it right,” she would tell me, scraping grease into a coffee can by the sink, “and it will keep you.”

Nothing wasted. Nothing forgotten.

That was Casper Creek’s religion long before the church ever put words to it.

People here shared because they had to. When a man lost his job at the elevator, groceries appeared on his porch. When a woman buried her husband, casseroles lined her counters until there was nowhere left to sit. And when the winter came hard, and it always did, there was meat.

Wrapped in butcher paper. Tied with twine. No return address. Nothing fancy.

It came from the meat locker behind the church.

The freezer sat half buried in the ground like a concrete tick, feeding on the earth. The door screamed when it opened, a long metal wail that carried across the gravel lot. You could hear it from the sanctuary during service if someone went out back, and no one ever looked toward the sound.

You were not supposed to.

I grew up knowing the locker the same way I knew the cemetery, present, useful, not to be lingered on. My grandmother never explained it. She did not have to. She would just say, “Go on, grab a package. The Lord provides.”

And I believed her.

When she died, the town provided back.

That should have frightened me more than it did.

Chapter Two

Grandma Ruth’s house had been shrinking for years.

Not physically, not really, but in the way unused rooms closed in on themselves, doors left shut, furniture collecting dust like it was being slowly buried. By the time she died, she lived between the kitchen, the bathroom, and the chair by the window that faced the fields.

That is where I found her.

Hands folded. Mouth slightly open. The radio playing low, gospel bleeding into static. Outside, the corn rattled in the wind like dry bones.

The doctor said it was her heart. Clean. Quick. A strange mercy of sorts.

The town said she had lived a good life.

I stayed after the funeral to clean. It felt wrong to leave her house to strangers, even though the town insisted they would help. I wanted to see what she had left behind. I wanted proof she had actually been here.

The basement was cool and smelled of dirt and vinegar. Shelves lined the walls, sagging slightly under the weight of glass jars. Beans. Tomatoes. Beets. Everything labeled in her careful script.

Dates mattered to her. Names mattered.

I noticed then how many jars were marked For Church.

In the kitchen, I found butcher paper folded and refolded until it was thin as cloth. Twine wound neatly on a nail. A marker by the sink, its tip stained dark.

There was a stain on the counter I did not remember. A rust colored shadow that would not come up no matter how hard I scrubbed.

That night, I dreamed of her standing at the sink, humming, hands red to the wrists.

The next Sunday, Pastor Lowell found me after service.

“Your grandmother used to help with inventory,” he said. “We would appreciate it if you could take over.”

His smile was kind, practiced.

I said yes.

Chapter Three

The donation freezer was louder than I remembered.

The scream of the door set my teeth on edge, echoing off the church walls and into the empty fields beyond. Cold spilled out, thick and damp, carrying the faint smell of iron beneath it.

Inside, the shelves were full.

Not messy. Not rushed.

Careful.

Every package was wrapped tight in butcher paper, the corners folded precise, twine cinched so snug it cut into the flesh beneath. Names were written across each one in marker, black ink stark against white paper.

I tried not to read them.

I failed.

Ruth H. Miller sat on the bottom shelf, paper darkened with moisture. Pink liquid seeped from one corner, dripping slow onto the concrete floor.

I knelt without meaning to.

The handwriting was hers. I knew it the way you know a voice in the dark.

I reached for another package, hands numb. The paper was stiff with frost. Beneath it, something shifted, just slightly, settling into place.

The door closed behind me.

Pastor Lowell’s reflection wavered in the metal shelves.

“She believed in giving back,” he said softly. “Your grandmother.”

My breath fogged the air. My heart beat too loud in my ears.

“Giving back what?” I asked.

He did not answer right away.

From somewhere deep in the freezer, there came a dull, hollow thump. Not a bang. Not a cry.

Just a reminder.

Pastor Lowell met my eyes.

“Enough,” he said.

Chapter Four

Pastor Lowell did not touch the packages.

He stood just inside the freezer door, hands folded at his waist, coat buttoned despite the cold. He watched me the way you watch a child learning something unpleasant but necessary.

“We will go shelf by shelf,” he said. “You just mark the names. I will handle the rest.”

“The rest of what,” I asked.

He smiled again, that same careful smile. “Distribution.”

I nodded because my body seemed to know this was expected of it. My hands moved before my thoughts could catch up.

The clipboard was cold. The pen skipped when I tried to write.

Names filled the shelves. Some I recognized. Some I did not. Old families, newer ones, people who had moved away, people who had not been spoken of in years. A few were written in shaky script, as if the hand that labeled them had been tired or afraid.

One package near the top shelf had no name at all. Just a date.

I pointed at it. “What about that one.”

Pastor Lowell did not look where I pointed. “That was an emergency,” he said. “We did not have time.”

Time for what went unsaid.

As I wrote, I noticed patterns. Dates clustered around hard winters. After the flood. After the factory closed. After the year the crops failed so badly people fed deer apples from their own trees.

“Does everyone know,” I asked, my voice thin in the cold.

He considered this. “Everyone knows enough.”

Another sound came from the back of the freezer. A soft scrape, like something shifting against concrete.

I did not look.

When we were done, Pastor Lowell took the clipboard and nodded once. “You did well,” he said. “Your grandmother always did.”

The door screamed open again, and the cold loosened its grip. I did not breathe right until we were back outside.

The church bell rang then, slow and steady.

Dinner time.

Chapter Five

That night, I stood in my kitchen staring at the stove.

A package lay on the counter. No name on this one. Just twine and paper, folded with care. It had been left on my porch sometime after I got home. No knock. No note.

The smell came through the paper, faint but unmistakable.

Meat.

I told myself it was venison. I told myself it was pork. I told myself a lot of things while my hands moved on their own, unwrapping, rinsing, seasoning the way I had watched my grandmother do a hundred times.

I did not look too closely.

When it cooked, the smell filled the house, rich and warm and comforting in a way that made my throat ache. My stomach growled, traitorous.

I ate slowly.

It tasted like nothing special. It tasted like survival.

That night, I dreamed of the town as it had been before I was born. Smaller. Hungrier. People with hollow faces and careful eyes. I saw them gather behind the church, hands clasped, breath steaming in the cold.

Someone stepped forward.

I woke with my jaw aching, like I had been chewing something tough.

The next morning, I noticed the ache in my arm again, just below the elbow. Faint bruising bloomed there, yellow and purple, like fingers had pressed too hard.

At the store, people smiled at me more than usual. Mrs. Calder from the bank touched my sleeve and said, “Your grandmother would be proud.”

At the church bulletin board, a notice had been posted.

VOLUNTEERS NEEDED

WINTER PREPARATION

I did not take one of the slips.

Not yet.

That night, I stood at my grandmother’s sink and washed my hands until the water ran cold. That damned rust colored stain on the counter seemed darker than before.

I thought of her careful handwriting. Her labels. Her jars.

Nothing wasted. Nothing forgotten.

Outside, the fields rustled softly, like they were listening.

Chapter Six

I thought I was doing the right thing.

I carried the package into the town hall, past the courthouse steps slick with mud, past the bare trees shaking in the cold wind. Inside, the hall smelled of varnish, old wood, and the faint copper tang of iron that set my stomach roiling. The chairs were stacked along the walls, and the podium gleamed under the harsh yellow lights.

People turned as I entered. Eyes narrowed. Faces I knew stared at me with suspicion. Whispers curled through the room like thick smoke.

“Mayor,” I said, raising the package. “You have to see this. Behind the church…what’s happening; is…”

A laugh cut me off, high and sharp, like a knife scraping glass. It stopped abruptly when Pastor Lowell stepped into the doorway, calm and deliberate. He was taller than I remembered, his coat hanging straight, his hands folded in front of him. His eyes, dark and still, roamed the room and settled on me.

“Thomas,” he said softly. “You do not understand.”

“I understand perfectly,” I said, my voice trembling. “The freezer, the packages…they’re not food. They’re…”

“You dare speak here of lies?” someone shouted. A woman pointed, a finger trembling. “He’s the devil!”

Others joined in, murmurs swelling to shouts. “Sacrilege!” “Blasphemer!”

Pastor Lowell’s lips curved faintly. “You see, they cannot be saved if they speak against the work. Thomas, you were warned.”

The crowd surged forward. Knives, sticks, bats, and whatever they could grasp appeared in their hands. I froze. Every face I recognized was twisted in rage. Every friend, every neighbor, every familiar voice shouted for my blood.

“I… I’m telling the truth,” I said. “Pastor Lowell, he-he’s the one doing this!”

“He is saving us!” someone shouted. “You are the devil!”

The package slipped from my hands and split open. Its contents pooled across the floor, dark and coppery. I did not look closely. My stomach churned, my hands shook, my breath came in ragged bursts.

Pastor Lowell stepped toward me, his face calm, almost expectant. “Do not resist,” he said, voice soft, almost hypnotic. “This is how it must be.”

The crowd did not wait.

Chapter Seven

I ran.

Through mud and frost, into the tall cornfields beyond the hall. The stalks pressed against me, brushing my face, tripping my legs. The shouts grew behind me, every footstep heavy with intent. I could hear the scrape of sticks on the ground, the thud of boots in the wet earth.

Pastor Lowell’s voice echoed after me, but not to stop them; it carried instruction. “Hold him! Don’t let him escape!”

Everywhere I looked, faces emerged from the corn, lit by the dying sun. Angry, silent, determined. They had grown up with his words. They had learned obedience, and now their devotion was a weapon.

A figure lunged. I fell, mud in my eyes, hands raw on the frozen earth. A pipe swung over my back, missed by inches. A knife cut the sleeve of my coat. I scrambled, digging my fingers into the dirt, pulling myself upright.

Through the corn, I saw him. Pastor Lowell, standing on the edge of the field, calm, still, hands lifted slightly, as if conducting the madness around him. A faint smile curved his lips. He did not intervene. He never intervened.

I ran, unseeing, slipping into a ditch, the screams fading into the rustle of the stalks. The wind carried them to me, the prayers, the curses, the chants. I was alone.

The package lay open behind me, its contents forgotten in the mud. My hands were slick with something that did not feel like blood or meat, though I could not tell. My chest heaved, my head spun, and yet I kept running, knowing the town would not stop, knowing Pastor Lowell had planned it this way all along.

I emerged from the corn at the edge of the river. The water was black and cold. My boots sank in the mud. Behind me, I heard them coming again.

I knew I could not outrun them.

And then I understood.

Pastor Lowell had never wanted to save anyone. He had wanted me, specifically.

He wanted me to understand fear. To understand helplessness. To know what it meant to be hunted by everyone you once trusted.

I now sit crouched by the water, listening to the heavy steps in the mud behind me, and I wait for them to find me.",1,1767173471.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,0.99,False

It was late December 2025, and winter seeped in through the poorly sealed windows, but inside the first-floor common room, the heat from electric heaters and the tightly packed bodies created an almost suffocating atmosphere. The walls were covered in faded posters of indie bands, scribbled exam schedules, and a corkboard plastered with notes like ""Don't steal my yogurt from the fridge!"" or ""New Year's Eve party: bring your own drinks.""

Izuku Midoriya and Katsuki Bakugo descended the fifth-floor stairs, Bakugo's footsteps thundering in comparison to Izuku's softer ones. Izuku carried the delivery bag in one hand, adjusting the green hoodie he'd worn since middle school—a memento of simpler times—while Bakugo, in his black tank top that showed off his arms toned from hours at the gym, muttered something about how pathetic ordering food online was.

""I warned you, Deku,"" Bakugo growled, kicking the common room door open. ""That new app is garbage. They always send anything but what you ordered.""

Izuku sighed, scratching his head at his messy green hair.

""Come on, Kacchan, don't be so pessimistic. I had a 30% off coupon, and the reviews said the katsudon was epic. Besides, after that marathon study session for the Applied Physics exam, we deserve something good."" Imagine: crispy breaded pork, steaming rice...!

Bakugo let out a sarcastic laugh, entering the room first.

""Dream on, nerd. If something's wrong, you'll eat it anyway. You always do.""

The common room was unusually lively for a Tuesday night. The large sofa, its cushions sagging from years of use, was occupied by Eijiro Kirishima and Denki Kaminari, who were playing a fighting video game on the old console connected to the TV. Kirishima, with his dyed red hair and perpetual grin, yelled every time his character landed an uppercut.

""Take that, Denki! My combo's unstoppable!""

Denki, blond and with a perpetual expression of amused confusion, leaned forward, controller in hand.

""It's not fair, bro! Your character is overpowered. Rematch!""


Next to them, in the worn velvet armchair, Momo Yaoyorozu was reading a thick book on advanced economics, her thin-framed glasses sliding down her nose as she took notes in a notebook. Ochaco Uraraka, sitting on the floor on a pink pillow she had brought herself, chatted with Momo while sipping apple tea from a mug with an astronaut design.


""Do you think the Macroeconomics professor is going to put that formula on the exam?"" Uraraka asked, her voice light and cheerful. ""Because if he does, I'm doomed. I don't understand anything about supply curves!""


Momo looked up, smiling with her characteristic natural elegance.


""Don't worry, Ochaco."" It's more intuitive than it seems. The supply increases with the price because… —he began to explain, gesturing with his pencil.

In the darkest corner of the room, near the fogged window, sat the three who always seemed out of place: Tomura Shigaraki, slumped in a folding chair with the hood pulled over his head, scratching his neck as he scrolled on his phone; Dabi, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed and a scar visible under his eye, smoking an e-cigarette with a bored expression; and Shoto Todoroki, sitting silently on the floor with his legs crossed, staring into space as if he were in another dimension. No one knew why those three always ended up in the same room—Shigaraki was studying sociology out of pure rebellion against ""the system,"" Dabi visual art with a focus on controversial installations, and Shoto law because his family pressured him—but it was already part of the routine. Sometimes they exchanged words, sometimes they didn't.


Izuku placed the bag on the coffee table, a scratched wooden surface covered with empty glasses and remote controls.


""Alright, everyone, time to eat! I ordered enough to share if you want.""

He opened the bag with anticipation, but the aroma he expected didn't arrive. Instead, he pulled out an elegant black cardboard box, tied with a gold ribbon that looked like it came from a luxury boutique.


""What the heck?"" Izuku muttered, untying the ribbon.


Inside: nine purple grapes. Large, juicy, and glistening under the fluorescent ceiling light. Exactly nine. One for each person in the room.

Denki let out a booming laugh, nearly dropping the remote control.


—Seriously? Gourmet fruit delivery? I thought you ordered real food, Midoriya!


Kirishima leaned in for a better look, laughing.


—Bro, they look expensive. Are they organic or what? They smell sweet.


Uraraka peeked out, curious.


—That's weird... Didn't you order katsudon? This feels like an epic fail.


Momo closed her book, frowning.


—Let's count: one, two... nine. Exactly the same for everyone here. What a peculiar coincidence.


Shigaraki looked up for the first time, with a disdainful sneer.


—This seems like a bad joke. Who orders grapes for delivery?


Dabi chuckled softly, exhaling steam.


—Someone with too much money and not enough brains.


Todoroki said nothing, just stared at the grapes indifferently.


Izuku turned red with fury, clenching his fists.


—This isn't what I ordered! I'm going downstairs and grabbing the delivery guy before he leaves! This is a scam!

He stormed out of the room, the door slamming behind him.


Bakugo, who had been watching everything with a crooked smile, let out a hoarse laugh and grabbed a grape, shoving it into his mouth without a second thought.


""Hahaha, look at the nerd in berserker mode. Come on, idiots, don't let it go to waste. Let's share this crap 'food.'""


Kirishima looked at him, doubtful.


""Are you sure, Bakugo? They could be poisoned or something.""


Bakugo tossed him a grape.


""Here, stone man. See if it makes you more of a man. Eat and shut up.""

""Kirishima looked at him, doubtful.""
Kirishima caught it and ate it, shrugging.


""It tastes... normal. Sweet.""


Denki held out his hand.


""I want some! If it's free, why not?""


Bakugo tossed him one.


""Get your batteries charged, short circuit. Maybe it'll make you smarter.""


Denki bit into it, laughing.


""Mmm, juicy. I feel more alive now!""


To Momo: Bakugo approached and sarcastically offered her one.


""Here, brainiac."" I'm sure you know the scientific name of this thing.

Momo politely took it, examining it.

""Vitis vinifera, probably. Thanks, Bakugo.""

She ate it gracefully.

Uraraka looked at Bakugo with a shy smile.

""For me too?""

Bakugo gently tossed it to her.

""It floats with happiness, all round and fluffy. Eat.""

Uraraka caught it and bit into it.

""Thanks. It tastes good.""

Shoto was next. Bakugo simply threw the grape to him without a word. Shoto caught it in mid-air, looked at it for a second, and silently ate it.

Dabi raised an eyebrow.

""What about me? Or are you going to ignore me, explosive?""

Bakugo smirked and threw one at him.

""Burn it if you want, pyromaniac. Let's see if it warms your cold soul.""

Dabi caught it with one hand, bit into it, and spat the bone onto the ground.

""Not bad.""

Shigaraki was the last one before Izuku. He looked at him suspiciously, scratching his neck.

""I don't want your charity.""
Bakugo shrugged and tossed him the grape.


""It's not charity, dead hands. It's so we don't waste it. Don't disintegrate it before eating it.""


Shigaraki caught it, glared at him, and ate it, muttering under his breath.


""Idiot.""


Only one grape remained in the box.


Izuku returned panting, his face sweaty.


""The guy left on a black motorcycle. No license plate or anything! This is a total rip-off! I'm going to report the app.""


Bakugo threw him the last grape.


""Eat and relax, Deku. At least it's fruit. Organic or whatever.""

Izuku caught it mid-air, still angry, and shoved it into his mouth in a furious bite.


""It tastes... weird. Too sweet.""


At that precise moment, the living room door creaked open again.


The delivery person had returned.


But it wasn't the skinny kid in a cap and reflective jacket that Izuku had seen downstairs.

It was a tall, imposing woman with pronounced curves squeezed into a black business suit that seemed molded directly onto her skin. Her long, dark hair fell in perfect waves to her waist. Her red lips curved into a smile that revealed too many white teeth.

Everyone froze.

Denki was the first to break the silence.

""Who... who are you? And where's the delivery guy?""

The woman took a step forward, her voice a silky whisper that seemed to echo in their minds.

""Very good. Perfect. Everyone ate one. This is... absolutely incredible.""

She placed a hand on her chest in a theatrical gesture, as if she were in a play.

""Let me introduce myself: you can call me Ms. X. I'm, shall we say... a traveling saleswoman of once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. And I just gave you something special: grapes that grant powers.""
The silence lasted a heartbeat.


Then, Denki burst into laughter, doubling over on the couch.


""Powers? Seriously? This is better than a low-budget movie!""


Kirishima laughed too, patting Denki on the back.


""Bro, are you on drugs or what? Magic grapes! Hahaha.""


Uraraka covered her mouth, laughing nervously.


""Sounds crazy... but why did you change your... appearance?""


Momo adjusted her glasses, serious.


""This must be an illusion or a trick."" There's no scientific basis for a fruit altering human biology.

Shigaraki let out a dry laugh.

""You're crazy. Get out of here before I call security.""

Dabi smiled crookedly.

Interesting show. How much do you charge per hour?

Todoroki said nothing, just watched.

Bakugo crossed his arms sarcastically.

""You seriously expect us to swallow that crap? That a grape is going to give us superpowers? How stupid are you. Although... it is freaking weird that you used to be a man. Quick surgery?""
Ms. X smiled wider, her eyes sparkling with mischievous amusement.


""Well, what a bunch of stubborn kids. I love a challenge.""


Then, she stared at an empty Coca-Cola can lying on the table, abandoned by Denki.


The can exploded with a sharp crack, like a firecracker. Metal fragments flew in all directions, embedding themselves in the wall and the floor, but not hitting anyone.


Silence returned, heavy as lead.


Denki opened his mouth.


""What... how...?""


Kirishima paled.


—Bro, that wasn't a trick.


Uraraka gasped.


—This... this isn't normal.


Momo murmured, pale.


—It can't be. It violates the laws of physics.


Shigaraki scratched his neck harder.


—Damn...


Dabi raised an eyebrow.


—Well played.


Todoroki narrowed his eyes.


—Real.


Bakugo's eyes widened, his voice hoarse.


""This... this is fucking real.""


Ms. X was already turning toward the door, her figure beginning to fade like smoke in the wind.


""Let's see how fun this gets now,"" she whispered with a low laugh before disappearing completely, leaving only an echo in the air.


And then, chaos erupted.


Denki was the first to feel it. A tingling in his hands, then blue sparks flew from his fingers like faulty fireworks.


""Ah! What the hell!"" he yelled, and electricity shot out, hitting Kirishima directly in the chest.


Kirishima took a step back, but the shock didn't hurt. On the contrary: her skin instantly hardened, turning red and stony, like living armor.

""Whoa! That stung a little, but... it didn't even tickle! Bro, I'm indestructible!""

Denki stared at his hands, terrified and fascinated.

""I can... shoot lightning! Like a comic book superhero!""

Startled by the noise, Uraraka ducked behind the nearest armchair, covering her head.

""Don't look at me! This is crazy!""

But no one saw her. Her body had completely vanished. Only her clothes floated: the pink hoodie, the pants, the sneakers... as if an invisible ghost were wearing them, hovering slightly.


Kirishima blinked.


""Uraraka? Where are you? I only see your clothes... floating.""


Uraraka poked her head out—invisible—and touched her arm.


""I'm here! But... I can't see myself in the mirror! I'm invisible!""


Momo, flustered by all the commotion, suddenly sneezed. Two red beams, thin and precise like lasers, shot from her eyes, slicing the back of the sofa in two perfect halves that fell to the floor with a thud.


""Oh, no! My eyes!"" she exclaimed, covering her face. ""I can shoot lasers!""


Dabi let out a long sigh, as if he were bored with life. Then, without warning, his entire body was engulfed in cold blue flames that crackled with a sound like icy wind. They didn't burn his clothes or the floor, they just danced around him.


""Wow... blue fire. Not bad,"" he muttered, flexing his flame-enveloped fingers. ""I could get used to it.""


Bakugo opened the palm of his right hand. A small but controlled explosion erupted, shattering a nearby floor lamp in a shower of orange sparks.


""Damn... explosions. From my hands,"" he said with a savage grin. ""This is... powerful.""


Shigaraki accidentally brushed his five fingers against the wooden table as he tried to stand up. The table disintegrated into gray dust in seconds, collapsing into a cloud of particles.

""Damn... I touch it and it melts,"" he muttered, looking at his hands with a mixture of horror and excitement. ""Disintegration.""

Todoroki felt a sudden chill run down the right side of his body. His entire arm was covered in crystalline ice that grew like living frost, spreading up to his shoulder.

""Ice... I'm turning into ice,"" he said calmly, but his eyes showed surprise. ""I can control it.""

And Izuku... Izuku was floating. His feet lifted off the ground effortlessly, rising about half a meter into the air. His green hair rippled gently, as if he were underwater, and a smile of pure wonder lit up his face.


""I'm flying! Really! This is incredible!""


Everyone looked at each other, the air thick with adrenaline. Denki accidentally fired another spark, laughing nervously.


""We're like mutants or something! This changes everything!""


Kirishima flexed his hardened arms.


""I'm a living rock! Nobody can break me!""


Uraraka, still invisible, floated her clothes toward the group.


""I can hide from anyone! It's cool... and terrifying!""


Momo blinked, testing a small laser that sliced ​​a cushion.


—Destructive power... but I could use it for good.


Dabi extinguished his flames with a thought.


—Fire that doesn't burn what I don't want. Useful.


Shigaraki touched an empty glass; it disintegrated.


—Everything I touch dies. Perfect.


Todoroki melted some ice.


—Ice at will. Controlled cold.


Bakugo detonated a small ball of air in his palm.


—Explosions. I can destroy anything.


Izuku lowered himself slightly, his eyes shining with genuine excitement.


""It's incredible, everyone! We have these powers now! We can be like the heroes in the comics we read as kids, Kacchan! Help people, stop crimes, do good! Imagine: saving lives, protecting the weak!""


Denki nodded enthusiastically.


""Yeah! I can electrify the bad guys!""


Kirishima thumped his hardened chest.


""And I'll tank the hits!""


Uraraka became visible for a second—apparently she could control it—and smiled.


""Invisible to spy and help!""

Momo nodded.


""My lasers for precision.""


Todoroki muttered.


""Ice for containment.""


But Bakugo... Bakugo stared at him, his red eyes glowing with something dark, something that had been festering inside him for years of pent-up frustration.


""No,"" he whispered, his voice low like distant thunder.


Izuku tilted his head, still floating in innocence.


""What did you say, Kacchan? Didn't you say what?""


Bakugo took a step forward, the explosions crackling in his palms like contained fires.


""The world doesn't need heroes, Deku.""


""His voice was dangerous, heavy with resentment.""


""It needs to be fixed.""


""Denki blinked.""


""Fixed? What are you talking about, Bakugo?""


""Kirishima frowned.""


""Bro, this is a chance to do some good.""


""Uraraka became fully visible.""


""Yeah, why so negative?""


""Momo chimed in.""


""Bakugo, explain yourself."" This could be a scientific breakthrough...

Shigaraki, however, smirked from his corner.


""Fixed... I like the sound of that.""


Dabi extinguished his flames and stood up straight.


""Go on, explosive. Tell us more.""


Izuku lowered himself to the ground, confused and worried.


""What are you talking about, Kacchan? This is great, we can team up, form a team...""

Bakugo looked up. His eyes seemed bloodshot, not literally, but with an inner fury that burned.


""The world must be fixed,"" he repeated, now louder, firmer, his voice echoing in the room. It doesn't deserve to be saved. It's rotten: corruption, injustice, people trampling the weak with impunity. Heroes only patch things up. I... we... will break it down to rebuild it.

Shigaraki chuckled softly.

—Exactly. Disintegrate the old.

Dabi smiled.

—Burn what's useless.

Izuku gasped in horror.

—Kacchan... no. That sounds like... destruction. We can change it without violence.

Bakugo suddenly extended both hands.

—You don't understand, Deku. You never have.

A massive, perfectly aimed explosion shot from his palms. Not to kill, just to push back with brutal force.

The shockwave hit like an invisible wall.

Denki was thrown backward, crashing into the wall with a muffled scream.

""Bakugo!""

Todoroki tried to shield himself with a wall of fast ice, but the force threw him back anyway, shattering the ice into fragments.

Uraraka instinctively turned invisible, but the shockwave pushed her back, and her floating clothes rolled across the floor like a ball.

Momo created a shield of... wait, no, just lasers; she tried to fire a laser to counter, but the blast sent her crashing into the shelves, books falling on top of her.
Kirishima stiffened his body to its maximum, but even he was thrown back several meters, crashing into the sofa.


And Izuku… Izuku tried to fly higher to dodge, but the shockwave caught him squarely, slamming him against the ceiling before he hit the floor with a thud.


When the smoke and dust settled, the room was a mess: overturned furniture, scarred walls, broken lamps.


Bakugo was already at the door, his expression hard.


Beside him, Shigaraki stood up, scratching his neck with a maniacal grin.


""Come on. This is just the beginning.""


Dabi walked calmly, reigniting his blue flames.


—Time to repair.


The three left without looking back, the door closing with a final click.


In the living room, Denki stood up coughing.


—What... what just happened?


Kirishima helped Uraraka—now visible—to her feet.


—Bro... Bakugo went crazy.


Momo dusted herself off.


—This is serious. We need to stop them.


Todoroki melted the remaining ice.


—They've chosen the wrong side.


Izuku, still on the ground among shards of wood, stared at the empty door, tears burning his eyes. His voice was a broken whisper.


""Kacchan... why?""


Outside, on a cold December night, with light snow falling on the streetlight-lit sidewalk, Bakugo walked quickly, flanked by Shigaraki and Dabi.


Shigaraki broke the silence.


""Plan, explosive?""


Dabi added.


""Yeah, what's next? Burn the university down?""


Bakugo clenched his fists, small explosions leaping between his fingers like promises of chaos.


""Now,"" he said in a hoarse voice, full of dark determination, ""we begin to fix this rotten world. Step by step. Starting with those who corrupt it.""


And somewhere far away, invisible in the shadows, a silent laugh echoed.


Ms. X watched from a distance, her eyes gleaming with anticipation.


The game had barely begun, and the board had just tilted toward the abyss.



Any ideas on how I can improve this?

1q08vg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bloggers/comments/1q08vg5/porcelain_veneers_vs_composite_veneers_pros_cons/,Porcelain Veneers vs Composite Veneers: Pros & Cons,"# Dental veneers cost

People often see your smile as the first thing about you, and if you are one of those who wished to have straighter, whiter, or more uniform teeth, then veneers might be the best solution for you. Veneers are thin and fragile customized coverings that are fitted over your teeth to improve their color, contour, and general appearance.

However, in the choice between the two, porcelain veneers and composite veneers, most patients are still hesitant and the question is: Which alternative is best for me?

The two options can do wonders for the smile but differ in the material used, lifetime, cost, and the treatment. The upcoming discussion will bring to light the advantages and disadvantages of porcelain and composite veneers to allow you to make your choice backed by the evidence.

# What Are Dental Veneers?

Dental veneers are, in fact, the most popular cosmetic restorations that can cover various imperfections such as:

* Discoloration or stains
* Minor chips and cracks
* Gaps between teeth
* Mildly crooked or uneven teeth
* Worn-down enamel

They have the potential to alter the appearance of your teeth entirely, still giving them a natural look.

Two primary categories of veneers exist:

1. **Porcelain veneers**
2. **Composite (resin) veneers**

Now let’s see how both kinds function and what their differences are.

# 1. Porcelain Veneers

Dental veneers costPorcelain veneers are made of a thin, durable ceramic material that mimics the translucency and shine of natural enamel. These are custom-made in a dental laboratory to perfectly fit your teeth and smile design.

**Procedure:**

1. Your dentist removes a thin layer of enamel (around 0.3–0.5 mm).
2. The very first step in the whole process will be a digital scan or an impression of your teeth.
3. The manufacturing of the porcelain veneers will take some time, and during this period, the temporary ones will be applied.
4. Once they are placed, the veneers are securely attached to the teeth with the help of powerful dental cement.

Generally, porcelain veneers need two sittings but still provide that. Among the advantages are results that are not only natural-looking but also long-lasting.

**Pros of Porcelain Veneers**

**Exceptional Aesthetics:**  
Porcelain reflects light just like natural enamel, making your smile look realistic and radiant.

**Stain-Resistant:**  
Porcelain is a material with such properties that it can hardly be stained by coffee, tea, wine and tobacco like natural teeth or composite resin.

**Durable and Long-Lasting:**  
If proper oral care is given, they may last for 10-15 years or even longer.

**Custom Fit:**  
The color, shape and size of your natural teeth are considered very carefully in the making of every veneer.

**Biocompatible:**  
Porcelain is a material that is very friendly to the gums and does not cause any irritation.

**Cons of Porcelain Veneers**

**Cost:**  
Porcelain dental veneers are on the higher end of the price spectrum at the beginning than composite veneers.

**Irreversible Procedure:**  
To perform the operation, a layer of enamel must be removed, which means it cannot be reversed.

**Requires Two Appointments:**  
You’ll need at least two visits one for preparation and one for bonding.

**Repair Limitations:**  
If a porcelain veneer chips or cracks, it cannot be easily repaired it needs to be replaced.

# 2. Composite Veneers

Composite veneers fixate on the color of the tooth and are likewise made of the same material as dental fillings resin. During the whole process which is done in one visit, the dentist first sculpts the resin material onto the tooth, then shapes it, and finally polishes to brighten your smile.

**Procedure:**

1. Tooth preparation is minimal (if necessary).
2. The dentist puts on layers of composite resin on your tooth.
3. The resin is molded and then hardened with a curing light.
4. Then it is polished to provide a smooth and natural sheen.

Composite veneers sometimes get the name “same-day veneers” as they allow the whole process to take place in just one appointment.

**Pros of Composite Veneers**

**Affordable:**  
Their price is lower than that of porcelain veneers, making them economical.

**Quick Results:**  
Can be done in one visit ideal for those seeking an instant smile makeover.

**Less Enamel Removal:**  
The procedure is less invasive as there are less enamel removals, hence there is a more conservative treatment.

**Easily Repairable:**  
If the veneer chips or cracks, the dentist can repair it instead of replacing the entire veneer.

**Reversible Option:**  
You can still have the treatment reversed or replaced later with another one since only a minimal amount of enamel was removed.

**Cons of Composite Veneers**

**Less Durability:**  
Composite veneers have a lifespan of about 5 to 7 years, which is shorter than that of porcelain ones.

**Prone to Staining:**  
They can stain over time from tea, coffee, or smoking.

**Less Natural Shine:**  
Even though they are brightened up by polishing, they do not imitate the translucency of porcelain to the same extent.

**Can Wear Down Faster:**  
On the contrary, porcelain is much harder and more resistant to chipping than composite resin which thus leads to the latter’s faster wear.

# Which Type of Veneer Is Right for You?

Among the factors determining the selection of veneers are your budget, cosmetic goals, and oral health condition, among others.

Here’s how to decide:

**Choose Porcelain Veneers If:**

* Results that last for a long time, the best aesthetics, and so on, are your preferences.
* Discoloration or damage of moderate to severe extent is your problem.
* It is the case that you want less maintenance and more stain resistance.
* Smile makeover of the long-term nature is the one you are to invest in.

**Choose Composite Veneers If:**

* You want a fast and low-cost alteration.
* Your dental condition is such that there is some damage, discoloration, or irregularity in length.
* You prefer either a non-surgical approach or a temporary treatment.
* You do not mind having periodic touch-ups or replacements.

The doctor will look at your teeth and choose the best way for you according to your smile wishes and dental wellness.

# Maintenance Tips for Veneers

No matter if you go for porcelain or composite veneers, good care is required for both their look and life span.

* Use a non-abrasive toothpaste to brush your teeth 2 times a day.
* Floss once a day in order to prevent plaque from building up where the veneer edges meet the tooth.
* Do not chew on hard foods like ice, pens, or even your nails.
* Try not to consume a lot of staining foods/drinks (coffee, tea, red wine).
* Get your teeth cleaned and examined by the dentist every 6 months.
* If you are a nighttime teeth grinder, then wear a nightguard.

At Dr. Mulay’s Dental Clinic, we make veneers with exactness and attention, so they not only look like your natural teeth but also provide comfort and functionality.

# Conclusion

The choice between porcelain and composite veneers might be the one that gives you such a beautiful, smile full of confidence, but it is up to you to decide based on your personal goals, lifestyle, and financial situation.

* Porcelain veneers proffer beauty, durability, and stain resistance together with unmatched quality making them the best choice for those who want a long-term, high-end solution.
* Composite veneers, instead of being a very different, pretty, instant, and reversible option, can also perform an impressive transformation.

# FAQs on Porcelain and Composite Veneers

1. **How long do veneers last?** Ten to 15 years is the lifespan of porcelain veneers, with composite veneers about half as durable at 5–7 years. Their life can be lengthened through proper oral care and frequent dental check-ups.
2. **Are veneers permanent?** Porcelain veneers are termed permanent since the removal of a thin layer of enamel occurs. On the other hand, composite veneers are semi-permanent and can be changed or replaced with greater ease.
3. **Do veneers damage natural teeth?** No, veneers are safe and minimally invasive if an experienced dentist does the procedure. In fact, they prevent the tooth from being further worn down or discolored.
4. **Can I whiten veneers?** Although veneers cannot be whitened by any means, their cleanliness can be kept if one shuns foods that stain and visits the dentist for the cleaning regularly.
5. **Are veneers painful to get?** The whole procedure is practically painless. The local anesthesia used makes the preparation comfortable, and the majority of the patients experience very little sensitivity after the treatment.
6. **Which type of veneer looks more natural?** Porcelain veneers give a more realistic appearance due to their translucency and matching nature with natural enamel. Composite veneers are little less reflective but still can serve with beauty.
7. **Can veneers fix gaps or crooked teeth?** Veneers can indeed close small spaces, hide little crookedness, and make a super even smile without any braces.
8. **How do I choose the right dentist for veneers in Pune?** Opt for a proficient cosmetic dentist who has extensive experience and a good portfolio of veneer cases. Dr. Mulay’s Dental Clinic provides the latest digital smile design and artistic skill to create flawless results.

1q08tr2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q08tr2,Dancong oolong sampler set,"So apparently what I ordered which was accurate, was the sampler set.

It's a pack of six dancong oolongs of different kinds. 

Tasting the first one which is numbered 10 and labelled as xiyedan? xidong dancong oolong

The smell: 

In the dry, it smells of floral tea and cinnamon

In the wet, it smells like cinnamon and coffee

The brew:
95c
The whole packet, weighed the amount and came out to 7.31grams, as it was written in the instructions to dump the whole thing in the gaiwan
First steep was dumped as a rinse
Second steep was around 13 seconds give or take coz I was slow, lol
Third steep was also around 13 seconds
Fourth was 4 seconds
Last steep was around 4 seconds as well
Gaiwan size is 100ml

The taste: 

Second steep was tasting of black coffee, dark chocolate (85% dark, Choco addict, so I know), cinnamony, sweet, bitter but just about perfect

The flavor as it comes back up is sweet, lightly bitter, like black coffee with a small amount of sugar

Next steep was slightly more bitter, black coffee notes, sweet after taste

Next steep, I decided to brew it faster. Sabi sa packet to dump it right away sa fair cup, so I did my best.

It was less bitter, sweetened lighter in taste, I prefer this kind of brew (not to mention naka ilang inom na Ako so the steep will of course be weaker)

Last steep for the day, amazingly the intensity of flavor hasn't weaked much. It's just more of the same but slightly less. 

I can see how people like duck shit oolong. 

This stuff is great. It's like red / black tea with all the oolong goodness. Almost all the blackness and none of the undesirables of black tea. It's very much like black coffee or dark chocolate but all the tasty goodness of tea

There is though, a slight metallic aftertaste. I dunno kung sunog lang panlasa ko from the hot water or dahil sa tea. Also a small amount of astringency but nothing aggressive or bad.

Dapat lang nga pagka lagay mo sa gaiwan, dump it agad sa gong dao bei. You get more steeps, you also get more differentiation of flavor between steeps. Dapat makinig sa nakasulat sa instructions hahahahahahahah

I might drink the rest of this later habang may putukan sa labas. 

My last tea tasting for this year of 2025.

Thank you all for being patient with the noisiest and makulit member of this group. Thank you for making a mod, even if Bago lang Ako Dito.

More tea tastings to come, I hope.

May you all have a happy new year.

Okay so people (or at least those kinnie bingo boards) either say things like; Smart, self taught piano, tea over coffee, can be apathetic, manipulative, athletic, struggles with self doubt, OR; murder, yandere, crazy. Psycho, game code, scary, and that's it. 

Honestly this might just be me but I seriously started getting attached to the characters on my first time playing (especially Yuri) I thought for sure I might kin Yuri, then at the end where Monika said it. 

“you'll never be able to understand
one thing”

“it's the pain of knowing how alone
I really am in this world” 

“in this game”

“Knowing my friends
don't even have free will…”

“and worst of all, knowing what's really out
there, in your world, forever out of my reach.”

“I'm trapped, MC” 

That hit me HARD 

it sounded so close to home 
The solipsism 
The philosophy 
Most of all the solipsism. 


“you'll never be able to understand
one thing” - the feeling of psychosis or having a different point of view, an extremely difficult one, most likely from questioning reality/philosophy/realization 

“it's the pain of knowing how alone
I really am in this world” - absolutely screams solipsism, being alone, the only thing you will truly ever know exists, the only person you can truly prove has a consciousness 
 
“in this game” - not personally my view of solipsism but very common in philosophy style things 

“Knowing my friends
don't even have free will…”- also very common, especially in philosophy where they believe a hyper up is playing with them, or that the “friends” aren't actual people so whatever they do, they were *always* going to do that 

“and worst of all, knowing what's really out
there, in your world, forever out of my reach.” 

“I'm trapped, MC” - I don't need to explain. 


Now THATS what hit way too close to home (coming from someone who's been a solipsist since 13) and If that's not enough to kin her I don't know what is. 

Reading the dialogue changed my view. I thought Yuri was the most relatable 
But as soon as I read that I stopped, it sounded just like me, I just couldn't believe it, I felt like a deep connection to monika. Like she was saying something ONLY I would understand. And it felt kinda trappening for her to tell me I couldn't ever understand when that's something I've never understood more in my life.

1q08s1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Polestar/comments/1q08s1c/follow_up_polestar_4_as_a_first_ev_test_drive/,Follow Up: Polestar 4 as a first EV – test drive summary & next steps,"As mentioned in a previous post, my mother recently installed a solar system and also just crossed the 100,000 km (62k miles) mark with her 2018 Mercedes C200 T (estate). Combined with the fact that she has now retired, this felt like the perfect moment to seriously consider an EV as her next car.

Before deciding on the **Polestar 4,** we **test drove** the **Smart #5 (Brabus), the Hyundai IONIQ 5, and the Škoda Elroq.** All of them have their strengths, but for my mother a clear ranking emerged: Polestar 4 first, IONIQ 5 second, Škoda a close third, and the Smart last. The Smart’s quirky, busy interior simply didn’t suit her taste, while the Polestar stood out for its calm design, coherence, and overall driving feel. We chose these cars because they all sit in a similar price range in Germany – unfortunately also influenced by the fact that the Polestar is built in China, although pricing policies of German brands have become rather ambitious regardless of production location.

***We had the car for almost a full day, from 9:00 to about 16:00,*** covering roughly 420 km (261 mi). The route included motorway driving, a short stretch of state road, and urban driving in Berlin as well as her hometown. Conditions were realistic rather than ideal: 4–8 °C (ca. 40°F), very light rain in the morning, motorway speeds mostly around 120 km/h (75mph), with brief peaks at 150 km/h (95mph).

Average consumption over the full distance was **22.4 kWh/100 km (3.61 mi/kWh)**. For a first longer EV road trip, we considered this a very solid result. While the real-world efficiency of the Polestar 4 isn’t perfect, it never felt problematic in practice. Compared to the Škoda Elroq, which showed slightly better efficiency figures but also has a noticeably smaller battery, the Polestar felt at least as usable and actually more relaxed on longer distances.

Interestingly, even with her driving style, we slightly outperformed the ***Hyundai IONIQ 5, which came in at 22.9 kWh/100 km*** (3.49 mi/kWh) on a different drive that also included a lot of Autobahn and urban driving. That Hyundai run involved lower temperature settings and more city traffic, so it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison. Still, under broadly similar weather conditions, we didn’t observe any serious efficiency issues with the Polestar. On both cars, battery preconditioning worked perfectly, and charging behaviour was smooth and predictable. The IONIQ 5 did charge faster, but not dramatically so.

The Polestar 4 does not have an 800-V battery architecture, so it doesn’t post the very fastest charging figures on paper. In real life, this didn’t matter. We stopped at a 200 kW Alpitronic fast charger operated by EnBW on the A2 federal highway. We planned to charge for about six or seven minutes, grabbed a coffee, and returned after roughly twelve minutes – by then, the car had already charged more than we intended. Charging power briefly peaked at around 170 kW. After about 2.5 hours of driving, a 15–20 minute stop felt completely natural. For my mother, who *wants* to take breaks anyway, this is clearly not a negative.

She adapted to the rear-view camera very quickly, noting that most manoeuvres rely on side mirrors anyway, while the camera provides an excellent overall perspective. The 360-degree cameras, large central screen, and real steering-wheel buttons in the model year 2026 car all contributed to a very relaxed driving experience. The steering-wheel buttons are particularly important in daily use, and combined with Hey Google, which worked very well for controlling vehicle functions, she didn’t miss additional physical buttons elsewhere in the cabin. We had no issues with CarPlay or system stability throughout the day.

Traffic sign recognition worked about 85–95% of the time, which is as good as, if not better than, her previous Mercedes. The driver-assistance systems also felt less intrusive than in the Hyundai. A major plus for her was how easy it is to deactivate assistance systems in the Polestar: no odd button combinations or long presses, just a simple press on the steering wheel when starting the car or via shortcuts. That felt far more intuitive to her than the system in the IONIQ 5.

Ride comfort was one of the highlights. We drove the Long Range Single Motor (LRSM), and despite some claims that the Dual Motor rides better, the LRSM setup felt excellent, especially at this price point – calm, composed, and very comfortable over long motorway stretches.

Parking in her carport is tighter than before, but fully manageable. She’s comfortable with that compromise and knows she can always park in front of the house if needed.

**Next steps & open questions:**

We’re now in the process of acquiring either:

* a **used sub-5,000 km Polestar 4 LRSM MY26** from a dealership in **Storm** or **Space**, or
* a **Storm-coloured Polestar 4 LRSM** with **Prime Package (Plus + Pilot)** and optionally **leather**.

Delivery would likely be February or March, which raises the question of winter tires. The €3,400 Polestar asks for complete winter wheels feels rather steep, so we’re leaning toward a different solution.

Buying outright is still an option, but early leasing estimates look attractive: roughly €470–500 per month, depending on options such as leather, for 48 months and 15,000 km/year, with a moderate down payment. Insurance is expensive, but that’s to be expected. We should hear back from the dealership in the first full week of January, especially regarding exact availability and timing.

Finally, a question to **existing owners**: 

* Have you opted for a **ceramic coating** (weather throught the dealership or a dedicated detailer)? And has anyone applied it specifically with the **rear camera** in mind? We’ve heard mixed feedback about visibility in heavy rain and would be very interested in real-world experiences.
* Also is looking towards **All Season tires** like the Pirelli, Michelin or Continental worth it compared to Summer and Winter-Tire-Combo? 
* 11kW or 22kW **charger at home**. The Electrician recommended 11kW due to the ease of install and no approval by the local energy infrastructure company required. Was it worth it going from 11 to 22kW for those that did?
* For those that have leased Polestars in the past in Germany - how did it go?

All in all, the **420 km one-day test** confirmed what matters most to us: comfort, calmness, intuitive usability, and real-world competence. For my mother, the Polestar 4 simply felt like the most confidence-inspiring choice for her first EV.",3,1767172562.0,Polestar,8,1.0,False

I am a (male) revert, so obviously I don’t know as much about Islam as a born Muslim, but I would like to share my opinion.

I feel like estranging men and woman creates a damaging, and potentially dangerous environment. Obviously there are limits, and we should all do our best to keep our relationships in all forms as halal as possible. 

But jeez, women aren’t aliens 😭😭 women aren’t some weird creatures from another world. A lot of women are incredibly intelligent and have awesome personalities. 

We need to normalise talking after class, having intellectual discussing and having professional friendships between the genders.

In October this year my close friend passed away very suddenly and traumatically. He didn't pass away instantly and was on life support, but 'brain dead'. His wife called me and put her phone on loud speaker so I could say goodbye, I told him I'd miss him, I wasn't angry at him then finished it by randomly laughing and saying 'you know I'm a spooky git, so feel free to come say hi!""
He passed away 2 minutes later. I wasn't really sure if he heard me medically speaking and also judged myself for being so direct and weird in that final moment. (Side note, his wife was also laughing and crying too so I don't feel cringed about my behaviour now)

Just before Christmas my mum took me to a medium evening which we usually go to and enjoy. There was coffee,cake, and around 30 other people there. It got to the end and I hadn't got a message, but I was OK with that as I like seeing other people's messages come through. The medium looked at me and said 'there's a man here for you, he's showing me burning all the way from his throat to his stomach'- my friend passed pretty horrifically and I've never talked about any details. And then the next part was ' he's waving, smiling, dancing with tinsil like a feather boa and said I want this to be at least a BIT of a surprise!' My friend was very extrovert and flamboyant if he wanted to make a point.

I can't believe my friend heard me and made a spectacular entrance as he knew I was probably expecting him. 

Has anyone else had something similar when a loved one was passing?

Six months ago, we opened up the relationship when we started facing certain problems. We've been working on them simultaneously while casually seeing other people.

Recently, I met this man (28M) online, and he quite quickly infiltrated my irl socials. We would speak for hours on end and had a genuine spark. However, in less than two weeks, he stopped calling and would only ever text. He explained after 3 days of zero phone call that the reason behind his silence was that he had an extremely bad dream about me, that made him pull back to preserve his sanity while he was going through a tough time at work. While he did admit he missed me and dreamed of me in ""surreal"" ways, that he was addicted to my voice and was worried of the impact it had on him, I found little to no improvement in his behaviour and no attempt to make things go back to how they were.

He added me on snap and tried to sext/ exchange nudes multiple times. This is after I asked him once if he wanted more distance, to which he said he didn't know (I did get quieter and more reserved following that).

The first time, I merely sexted. The second time, I even refused to do that, let alone exchange pictures. He certainly got the clue, got quiet, and only sent reels here and there. After 3 days of radio silence from my end, I replied to a ""like"" of his on Instagram and he texted me on snapchat, again, looking for virtual action. I geared away the conversation quickly and asked why he hadn't been talking to me normally and if we were going to do so anytime soon. His responses were along the lines of not being able to think straight, being let off very late at work, some visceral headache he'd had for days. He promised that he'd be more available from 25th Dec and ""we'd talk"".

25th and 26th – absolutely no attempt whatsoever. His family adopted 2 new kittens and I replied to the story about them, reacted heart to his replies and didn't say anything. On 26th, very close to midnight, I texted on Snapchat that I couldn't do this back and forth anymore and I was not necessarily bitter, but the two-week silence from him was not doing it for me. I informed him I had removed him from socials. He saw the message and never replied. A couple days later, he heart-reacted to a selfie of mine I had posted on snapchat stories.

It certainly hurts because we had this genuine connection when we started talking. He would call me during lunch breaks and before he went to bed. I looked forward to talking to him. I remember, during our last conversation, I had said, ""I wish there were a parallel universe where I could just be your girlfriend."" That had prompted some mild accusations from his end, along the lines of my trying to fill up some void in my heart. When I said that that wasn't the case and he meant something to me, he had said he wouldn't ask for labels and whatnot. From then on, the silence began.

A part of me feels like I should have waited a couple days longer and confronted him, asked him why we weren't talking yet. A part of me is sure he'd have somehow evaded that question and that would have perhaps prompted me to remove him from everywhere anyway.

It's been a month since we started talking, and a part of me really wonders what went wrong. He and I never even got to meet, and it stings because I used to tell him how much I wanted to sit down with him and have coffee. I don't know exactly what I am asking for and what I want. I just needed to get this off my chest, given I haven't told a single soul about this.",3,1767172208.0,nonmonogamy,7,1.0,False

Fiancee (engaged last month) woke up last Monday, on what looked like deaths door. I called EMS to help by 8:00 am, decided it wasn’t the day to work at that point even tho I had work all week. Well, she’s wayyy sicker than anyone could have imagined. I spent 4 hours in a local ER with no resources, they finally transferred her down by ambulance to the ICU in the big city 50 miles away. Since Monday her parents and I have been with her every day as much as possible. I have been staying at their house, as they live about 10 minutes from the hospital she is in. I’m already also basically out of my job as they didn’t really accept my leave of absence and just expected me back immediately. I told them, our new life is in this new city. She needs better medical care and that is here.

We got answers the 2nd day. Hapatarenal failure, kidney and liver failure caused by alcohol. She’s in….bad shape. She has every complication involved with the disease and she has them all in a bad way. Her scores are almost off the charts (in a bad way) and she would go straight to the top of the liver transplant list due to having MELD scores so high and being at such risk of death.

We didn’t get much communication from her from last Tuesday to Friday, as when the liver fails it releases ammonia into the brain causing confusion, disorientation and complete brain fog. Friday we got the transfer we wanted to a hospital with a better liver team and a transplant team. Saturday and Sunday, she came alive. Talking, eating, feeling better and coherent even tho we still have a long road ahead.

Then came 8:00 am Monday. I’m always there first thing so I stopped to grab a coffee, chatted with a nice lady about how my 31 year old fiancée was in the ICU and things weren’t great. 10 seconds later, I turn a corner just to see 2 nurses SPRINTING toward ICU, I said “no no no” and I started after them with my full cup of coffee, they turned again, toward my fiancées room. I sped up again, turned the corner and saw about 8-10 nurses in her room with the bell dinging. I ran inside and said “WTF is going on?!?”  “Oh, her heart stopped we are having to do CPR” and they guided me out of the room quickly. 15 minutes later that had her intubated and stable enough.

I spent all day with her today 8:00 am to 9:30 pm actually. Her tests were looking better today, they believe we can take the ventilator off tomorrow. She also had a friend visit, who has been taking care of our place and has been bringing down some of the items we need from our house.

Well, I go back to my fiancées parents house tonight after being with her all day and her mom absolutely loses her complete fucking shit on me. I have NEVER seen a grown adult have a tantrum like this. They “like their space” and now I’m invading it, even tho they offered and their daughter is fucking close to death. They don’t spend half the time I do at the ICU and her mom “has to leave by 4:00 pm because she won’t drive in the dark” 😐😐

And she was pissed tonight that I stayed past the 8:00 pm hours, even tho that’s just on the nurses discretion and because I didn’t tell her about a “breathing test” they did on her at the end of the night, even tho it was minor and I told her about it as soon as I got home, plus we all knew about it from the doctors during the day.

She blamed me for EVERYTHING finally. “Why didn’t you do more!?!” “You live with her, why didn’t you save her?!?” “She shouldn’t be with you”

The drinking problem isn’t because of me. I only drink a couple of beers here and there. I have minimal influence on her drinking, we never “party” and we’ve maybe only been drunk together once or twice in 2 years. She’s hides the majority of the drinking from me. I have even encouraged her to drink less and to go to the doctor preemptively. She has other people she drinks with and we’ve only been together 2 years. This liver failure has been a long time coming.

And about 3 years ago she went to drug/alcohol rehab and 1 month after she completed it, her parents were giving her alcohol. 😐😐😐

They act like I’m stepping all over their toes, their life and their daughter. Her mother accused me of not giving a shit about her daughter and went so far to say that she doesn’t want me at the hospital anymore. Even tho she had actually caused a bunch of shit for the nurses and a couple have already mentioned something about her to me.

So I may never see my fiancée again because her mother decided while she is dying in the ICU that I’m not good enough for her now and this is all my fault specifically.

I’m going to try to wrap it up. There are wayyy more details I could get into…feel free to chat me up. Can’t imagine I’ll sleep tonight in this hotel I had to book at 11:30 pm.",36,1767172194.0,Vent,35,0.96,False

Since 2023 I have been working on a homemade ice cream cookbook. Before drafting a proposal, I recipe tested over 50 traditional ice cream recipes as well as 15 non-dairy and vegan recipes. I reached out to numerous publishers with my proposal and only heard back from one, letting me know to reach back out when my social media follower count was over 25K. Sigh.

So I pivoted because I needed folks to be able to make my delicious ice cream as soon as possible. I created a site where folks can buy my individual recipes as well as bundles of recipes. 

I have a Basics section, including recipes for, but not limited to French Vanilla Bean, The Best Chocolate Ice Cream of Your Life, Pistachio, Malted Peanut Butter, Earl Grey, etc. 

There is a Fan Favorite section which includes recipes for my Happy Birthday Cake ice cream and one I love called Graham Slam - which is Graham Cracker ice cream with pieces of homemade Graham Cracker Toffee - as well as a few others. 

There is Deconstructed section which includes recipes for my Deconstructed German Chocolate Cake ice cream, my Deconstructed Snickers Bar ice cream and a few others.

I also have a few Bundles right now. One is my Grocery Store Bundle which includes the six flavors I used to sell in grocery stores in Seattle from 2016-2019. The flavors include: French Vanilla Bean, Cookies N Cream, Rocky Road, Lemon Bar, Strawberry Pound Cake and Coffee Caramel.

 

Lastly, I have a Holiday Flavor Bundle which will be taken off come 1/1/2016. The flavors include: Holiday Eggnog, Gingerbread Cookie, Deconstructed Peppermint Bark and Cozy Hot Cocoa

1q08nug,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1q08nug/something_visits_my_apartment_every_night_at_217/,Something visits my apartment every night at 2:17 a.m.,"I moved into this apartment because it was cheap and close to my office. Nothing about it felt strange at first. It was an old building, four floors, narrow staircase, flickering tube lights in the corridor. The kind of place people forget exists.
I live alone.
The first thing I noticed was the sound.
Every night around 2:17 a.m., I heard footsteps outside my door.
Not loud. Not rushing. Just slow, deliberate steps. Like someone walking without any urgency, stopping occasionally, then continuing.
The first night it happened, I thought it was the night watchman. Old buildings creak. People move around. I checked the time, rolled over, and went back to sleep.
The second night, it happened again.
2:17 a.m.
Same pattern. Same slow steps. Same pause right outside my door.
I lay there staring at the ceiling, holding my breath. I didn’t hear keys. No cough. No phone sounds. Just breathing. Someone was breathing on the other side of my door.
I waited for a knock that never came.
By morning, I convinced myself I was overthinking. Stress. Long work hours. I even laughed about it while making coffee.
On the third night, I stayed awake.
At 2:15 a.m., I sat on my bed with the lights off. My phone clock glowed in the dark.
2:16.
2:17.
The footsteps started immediately, as if on schedule.
They came from the staircase, moved down the corridor, and stopped exactly in front of my door. I could see the shadow under the gap. Someone was standing there.
I counted my breaths. One minute passed. Two.
Then the shadow shifted, slightly, like the person leaned closer to the door.
I didn’t move. I didn’t make a sound.
After what felt like forever, the footsteps continued down the corridor and faded.
I didn’t sleep that night.
The next day, I asked the watchman about it. He frowned and said he locks the building gate at 1 a.m. No one is allowed to roam after that. He also said something else that stuck with me.
“There’s only one other tenant on your floor,” he said. “And he works night shift. He leaves at 8 p.m.”
That night, I placed a small piece of tape at the bottom of my door, barely noticeable. If someone opened it, I would know.
At 2:17 a.m., the footsteps came again.
This time, there was something different.
They didn’t stop.
They paced back and forth in front of my door. Slow steps. Turn. Slow steps. Turn. Over and over.
Then came the sound of fingernails.
Not scratching. Tapping.
Three taps. Pause.
Three taps. Pause.
I stared at the tape. It stayed intact.
The tapping stopped.
Silence.
Then, very softly, someone whispered my name.
Not loud. Not threatening. Almost curious.
I don’t know how they knew my name.
The footsteps moved away.
In the morning, the tape was still there. Undisturbed.
That night, I slept at a friend’s place.
The night after that, I came back, trying to act normal. I told myself I couldn’t run forever.
At 2:17 a.m., the footsteps didn’t come.
Instead, I heard them inside the apartment.
Slow steps. Bare feet. Moving from the living room toward my bedroom.
I was frozen. My door was locked. I could see the handle. It wasn’t moving.
The steps stopped right outside my bedroom door.
Something stood there for a long time.
Then I heard breathing again, closer than before.
The handle didn’t turn.
The steps retreated, slowly, back toward the living room.
When I finally gathered the courage to check, nothing was out of place. No open windows. No signs of forced entry.
The next morning, I found muddy footprints in my living room.
They stopped right outside my bedroom door.
Last night, the footsteps came again.
2:17 a.m.
But this time, they didn’t stop at my door.
They walked straight to my bed.
And stood there.
I haven’t looked. I don’t know if I want to.
I’m writing this because I don’t know what happens next. I don’t know why it’s coming closer every night.
And I don’t understand how something that never opens my door is already inside my apartment.

Each crate is warm, marked with my name, and rattles softly until the sun comes up...","I work nights at a distribution warehouse off the interstate.

Third shift. Midnight to eight. It’s not a career. It’s rent. It’s groceries. It’s the only job that didn’t ask questions when I showed up exhausted and said I could start immediately.

The warehouse handles overflow freight. Stuff that doesn’t fit cleanly into normal logistics. Late shipments. Rejected pallets. Crates that get moved around until someone higher up figures out where they’re supposed to go.

My job is simple. Scan incoming crates. Log them. Move them to temporary holding if the paperwork doesn’t line up. I’m not paid to think. I’m paid to keep things moving.

That’s why the first crate bothered me so much.

It came in on a truck that wasn’t on the schedule.

No driver signature. No manifest. Just a single wooden crate strapped to a pallet, shrink wrap tight enough to squeal when the forklift tines slid under it.

The wood looked new. Fresh. Still faintly yellow under the warehouse lights.

Stenciled on the side, in black block letters, was my full name.

First and last.

Spelled correctly.

I assumed it was a joke. Warehouses are full of bored people working nights. Someone messing around with a stencil didn’t seem impossible.

I scanned it.

Nothing came up.

No barcode. No entry. No rejection notice. The system treated it like it didn’t exist.

I logged it manually and rolled it into holding.

That’s when I noticed the heat.

The crate was warm.

Not sun-warmed. Not residual engine heat. Warm in a steady, internal way, like something electrical was running inside it.

I pressed my palm to the wood and pulled it back instinctively. It felt… alive. Not moving. Just producing heat the way bodies do.

I told myself it was insulated equipment. Maybe batteries. Maybe machinery still cycling down.

Then it rattled.

Not hard. Not violent.

A soft, uneven sound from inside the crate, like something shifting its weight.

I stepped back and laughed under my breath, because laughing was easier than thinking about it.

The rattle stopped.

I didn’t sleep well that day.

The second crate arrived the next night.

Same deal. No paperwork. Same truck number, still not in the system. Same size crate.

Same name.

This one was warmer.

The wood radiated heat through my gloves. When I leaned close, I could smell something faint and organic beneath the sawdust and oil.

The rattle came sooner this time.

A gentle knock from the inside.

Pause.

Another.

Slow. Curious. Like something testing the walls.

I flagged my supervisor.

He didn’t even look up from his tablet. “Put it with the others.”

“What others?” I asked.

He scrolled, frowned, then shook his head. “We’ll sort it out in the morning.”

Morning never sorted anything out.

By the end of the week, there were five crates.

All sealed.

All warm.

All marked with my name.

They arrived between 2:00 and 2:30 a.m. every night, and without fail, they stopped rattling right as the sun started to rise.

I started staying late, watching them from a distance, trying to catch whatever made the noise.

They never moved when I was looking.

But one morning, just before clocking out, I noticed something new carved into the side of the newest crate.

Not stenciled.

Scratched in by hand.

DELIVER TO OWNER
— STILL INSIDE

The crate nearest me rattled again.

Not softly this time.

And from somewhere inside the warehouse, I heard something else respond.

A sound that matched my breathing perfectly.

I stopped staying late after that.

I clocked out the second the shift ended, didn’t matter if the floor was backed up or the logs weren’t finished. I told myself the crates weren’t my problem once the sun was up. Day shift could deal with them. Management could explain them.

They didn’t.

The crates were always gone by the time I came back the next night.

Not processed. Not logged out. Not moved to outbound.

Gone.

The holding area would be empty except for faint dark outlines on the concrete where the pallets had sat, like heat shadows that hadn’t fully cooled yet. If I pressed my hand to the floor, it still felt warm.

I asked a guy from day shift about it.

He looked at me like I’d asked something deeply personal. “What crates?”

“The ones in holding,” I said. “The ones with my name on them.”

He laughed, but it wasn’t natural. Too quick. “You pulling overtime jokes now?”

I showed him a photo I’d taken on my phone. The stencil. My name. The scratch marks.

His smile vanished.

“That’s not funny,” he said. “Delete that.”

Before I could respond, my supervisor called me over and the conversation ended. When I checked my phone later, the photo was gone.

Not deleted.

Gone.

The next crate arrived heavier.

I knew before I touched it. The forklift strained just a little when I lifted it off the truck. The pallet groaned under the extra weight. Whatever was inside had density now.

The rattle was different too.

Slower. Closer together. Less exploratory.

Like breathing.

I stood there longer than I should have, staring at my name on the side, feeling a pressure behind my eyes I couldn’t explain. The warehouse lights flickered once overhead.

The crate rattled.

Three quick knocks from the inside.

Then silence.

I wheeled it into holding with my hands shaking and logged it manually again. This time, the system accepted the entry.

DESTINATION: FINAL DELIVERY

No address. No date. Just that.

When I tried to back out of the screen, it froze. The cursor blinked in place for a full ten seconds before releasing me.

That’s when I noticed the label on the crate had changed.

Under my name, new text had been stamped in red.

CONTENTS: REPLACEMENT

My phone buzzed in my pocket.

A voicemail notification.

No missed call. No number.

Just a timestamp.

2:14 a.m.

I didn’t listen to it. I couldn’t. I muted the phone and shoved it back into my pocket, heart hammering so hard my chest hurt.

The rattling started again.

Not just from one crate.

From all of them.

Five wooden boxes, spread across the holding area, knocking softly in uneven rhythm. Not synchronized. Not chaotic.

Conversational.

I backed away until my shoulders hit a steel rack.

The rattling slowed as I moved. One crate knocked twice. Another answered with three. A third followed, softer, almost hesitant.

They were communicating.

And then the newest crate did something none of the others had done before.

It shifted.

Not sliding. Not tipping.

The wood flexed inward slightly, like something inside had leaned its weight against the wall.

A long scratch dragged down the inside of the crate.

I heard it clearly. Nails. Or something shaped like them.

A voice followed. Muffled. Familiar.

“Almost ready,” it whispered.

The warehouse lights dimmed.

My phone vibrated again.

This time, the voicemail started playing on its own.

It was my voice.

Calm. Steady. Confident.

“I’m still inside,” it said. “But not for long.”

The rattling stopped all at once.

The warehouse went silent.

And somewhere behind me, I heard the slow mechanical whine of a loading bay door opening.

I didn’t turn around.

The loading bay door kept rising behind me, metal groaning as it climbed. Cold night air spilled into the warehouse, carrying the smell of diesel and wet asphalt. I stood frozen between the racks, staring at the crates like they might move if I looked away.

They didn’t.

They waited.

The door finished opening. I heard footsteps on concrete. Slow. Unhurried. Someone who knew exactly where they were going.

I reached for my radio. Dead.

Of course it was.

The footsteps stopped just out of sight, blocked by a row of pallets. Whoever it was didn’t come closer. Didn’t announce themselves. They were listening. Matching their breathing to mine the way the crate had earlier.

“Receiving,” a voice called calmly. My voice.

I swallowed hard. “Who’s there?”

A pause. Then, softer, “You are.”

The newest crate rattled again. Not knocking this time. Shaking, uneven, like something inside had shifted into a crouch. The heat coming off it felt stronger now, rolling against my shins in waves.

I backed toward the aisle, eyes never leaving the box.

“Paperwork’s cleared,” the voice said from the loading bay. “Just need your signature.”

I laughed. A sharp, broken sound. “There’s no paperwork.”

“That’s the point,” it replied.

The other crates began to rattle again, one by one, starting with the oldest. The sound wasn’t exploratory anymore. It was impatient. Like fingers drumming on a table.

I noticed something then. Something I hadn’t let myself see before.

Each crate wasn’t exactly the same size.

They were getting smaller.

Not by much. An inch here. A little less depth there. Gradual enough that I’d missed it. But now, lined up together, it was obvious.

Like molds being refined.

I felt sick.

“You don’t need all of them,” I said hoarsely. “There’s already… whatever you are.”

The footsteps resumed, closer now. I saw movement at the edge of the aisle. A shape stepping into the light.

It was wearing my uniform.

Same reflective stripes. Same scuffed boots. Same stain on the left thigh I never managed to wash out.

But the way it stood was wrong. Too still. Like it was holding itself together by copying what it remembered.

“I’m not finished yet,” it said. “You’re inconsistent.”

It gestured toward the crates. “These are corrections.”

The nearest crate rattled violently, then went still. A thin line split the wood from the inside. Not a crack. A seam. Perfect and straight.

I ran.

I don’t remember choosing a direction. I bolted past racks, alarms screaming in my head even though none went off. The warehouse stretched longer than it ever had before. Aisles repeating. Corners where there shouldn’t have been corners.

Behind me, something heavy thudded onto the floor.

Wood breaking.

The rattling turned into movement.

I risked a glance back.

One of the crates had split open.

Inside was a shape wrapped in packing foam and plastic, limbs tucked in tight. My limbs. My face pressed sideways against the clear wrap, eyes open and unfocused, mouth working soundlessly.

It wasn’t dead.

It was waiting.

I reached the emergency exit and slammed into the door.

It didn’t open.

The red EXIT sign flickered, then went dark.

The warehouse lights dimmed to half power. Long shadows stretched across the floor, converging behind me.

“You clock out in twenty minutes,” my voice said calmly from everywhere. “If you leave early, the count doesn’t balance.”

Something touched my shoulder.

Not a hand.

A crate corner. Warm. Familiar.

“Just sign,” it whispered. “Then you can go home.”

My phone buzzed in my pocket.

A notification from the warehouse system.

FINAL DELIVERY CONFIRMED
RECIPIENT: YOU
STATUS: IN PROGRESS

And somewhere close by, I heard wood creak again.

Not breaking.

Opening.

I stopped running.

Not because I gave up. Because I understood.

The warehouse wasn’t trying to keep me in.

It was trying to finish me.

I stood there in the half-lit aisle, chest heaving, the smell of splintered wood and hot plastic filling my nose. The EXIT sign stayed dark. The loading bay door was gone now, replaced by a blank stretch of concrete wall like it had never existed.

The footsteps approached. Slow. Confident.

I turned.

It was close enough now that I could see the details it had perfected. The crease between the eyebrows I get when I concentrate. The scar on my knuckle from a pallet strap snapping years ago. Even the slight hitch in my left shoulder when I breathed too deeply.

But its eyes were wrong.

Not empty.

Complete.

“I’m ready,” it said. “You’re not.”

Behind it, the last crate finished opening.

The foam peeled back in careful layers. Plastic hissed as it loosened. The thing inside sat up.

Me. Or what used to be me.

This one was closer than the others. Cleaner. Fewer mistakes. Its movements were stiff but deliberate, like it had been rehearsing while folded in the dark.

I finally understood the count.

Every crate wasn’t a copy.

It was a subtraction.

Each night, something had been taken out of me. Patience. Sleep. Memory. Reflex. Tiny inconsistencies shaved away until only the version that belonged here remained.

The warehouse hummed, satisfied.

“You don’t survive this job,” the first one said gently. “You get processed.”

I backed away until my calves hit the steel rack again. My badge scraped against the metal. I felt suddenly, painfully aware of my weight. My heat. My breath.

Temporary things.

My phone vibrated one last time.

A prompt filled the screen. No buttons. No choice.

FINAL CONFIRMATION REQUIRED
PLEASE PLACE HAND ON SURFACE

The concrete beneath my feet warmed.

The rack behind me vibrated softly, like a machine spooling up.

“I don’t consent,” I whispered.

The version of me smiled. “You clocked in.”

Hands took my arms. Not rough. Not violent. Efficient. Familiar. My grip strength. My posture.

As they guided me forward, I saw the crates one last time.

All of them empty now.

Except one.

A new crate was already being strapped shut near the loading bay wall, wood still steaming where the nails were driven in. Fresh stencil ink glistened under the lights.

My name.

Again.

I screamed, but the sound didn’t carry. It never does in a place designed for inventory.

The lid came down.

Darkness pressed in.

Warm. Tight. Correct.

Outside, somewhere far above the warehouse roof, the sky lightened. Morning shift arrived. Clipboards in hand. Coffee steaming. No questions.

A man in my uniform clocked out on time.

He stretched. Yawned. Complained about the hours.

As he walked toward the parking lot, a truck backed into the bay without being scheduled.

Inside it, a single empty pallet waited.

And deep in the holding area, a sealed crate rattled softly.

Yeah, the lyrics can tell you what themes bounces around my Vessel brain frequently.

If you don't know what Sleep Token is, I'm not being rude here or mean, obviously joining the my Discord server isn't the place you should be joining to ask all your questions making me look like an embarrassing Discord server owner.

Yeah, every single Discord member knows what Sleep Token is in the server and people that have never heard of the band are asking that question in the Discord server.

Yeah, I'm not trying to be mean here and that's not my goal at all trying to be mean at all.

However, asking in the Discord server what is Sleep Token and is Sleep Token a band is embarrassing, obviously that makes me look bad as a Discord server owner that is trying to promote the Discord server on Reddit.

Yeah, I'm REALLY obviously not joking when I said I had to kick out a few people yesterday for asking these questions.

What is Sleep Token, is Sleep Token a band? What are you members talking about in this server I don't understand and what is deity Sleep?

Yeah, I'm not understanding what your Discord server members are talking about 😭

The thing that you don't realize is this could make the whole Discord server that knows what Sleep Token is could make them think that I'm promoting this Discord server for random people to join to rack up the Discord server numbers of members up.

Which yeah, I don't want that promotional image on me.

The only thing I can ask is if you listen to Sleep Token FIRSt and IF you need a beginner guide that is already provided in the Discord server link underneath the hashtag Discord server owner intro.

Yeah, you can find a guidesheet there and helpful tips to get you started with the lore without asking too many questions in the general hashtags.

However, there IS a hashtag for further discussion about the lore for people that are further curious about the Sleep Token Lore.

That hashtag is where you can find people discussing Sleep Toke lore in that hashtag.

However, enough of that and we should focus on a simple bio.

Warning: long bio post (nothing hidden.)

What is your name and when I add you I want to know what I should call you as a greeting?

Yeah, I've recently decided to come out and announce that I'm a DID system/host and alters that are named E and S, their enjoyment comes from nicknames.

My real life name is for family members call me by my real life name only, my family doesn't even understand why I dye my hair, why I listen to the music I listen to, why I want a lot of hyper-fixation with band merchandise and you expect them to understand my complex Vessel brain, obviously that has to be a joke.

1 of my family members told me once and this is before we cut off contact unless it's a family emergency that psychologist text are inaccurate, obviously what this 1 family member was saying was that you should question your own psychologist and paperwork to question the accuracy because the test is a general test and psychologist test aren't ''official.''

1 of my family members has asked me as well that I shouldn't take my proper adult autistic diagnosis seriously and I should question the accuracy of my report 🤣

However, let's move on and let's talk about Sleep Token to make this bio more less ''is your family okay?'' 💀

Sleep Token is what's keeping me in a needle of the thread, Sleep Token is my current hyper-fixation, happiness and I cannot see myself stopping buying shirts. Even if I were to have 10 shirts one day, I'll still keep collecting the shirt designs that speak to me and the rare limited numbered merchandise as well.

Yeah, which I looked into yesterday no on Splatoon 3 if your Grizzco work rank is lower than mine, you can't level up your work rank and you can still receive the capsule rewards though, obviously your fish scales as well. My level in Grizzo is.

Profreshional only and I've reached Profreshional+2 is the highest I ever reached on Grizzco rank.

Haven't completed all the story modes, but I want to. However, I'm down to play whatever you want though even if it's just 30 minutes of Turf Wars and 30 minutes of Main Lobby.

Just know on Salmon Run and if you see me on Profreshional playing with you and I don't know how to use the sniper weapons, that's because I don't use those and I'm close to a noob how to use one 💀

Yeah, I'm not the only one on Profreshional rank that just doesn't knows how to use a sniper weapon as a pro 🤣

Yeah, I've seen one of my squad-team members looked so confused on how to use this weapon 🤣

Yeah, I'm not even a fan of camper style weapons, where you sit, camp and perch yourself high up.

That's not me and my style brand on Splatoon 3.

Yeah, I'd enjoy being mid/fling paint range from someone and honestly having a battle instead of being a camper/perched up somewhere high to splat 🤣

Yeah, I'm not afraid to duke things out with someone on the splat-field and that's okay if want to be an eagle camper style player 💀 To be fair of it all using the sniper isn't an easy weapon for any Splatoon player to use and that's cool-style that you enjoy the sniper weapons.

Yeah, something is more fun being in the middle of combat in the splat-field and seeing who can splat each other first and who is the stronger opponent. Yeah, I'm the thriller kind of Splatoon player 🤣 Bring on the fight and battle this out.

Yeah, 1 of my online friends that I play Splatoon with we normally close out an hour or an hour and a half sometimes on Splatoon. Yeah, sometimes we play 30-45 minutes of Fall Guys as well, then an hour of Splatoon 3 before logging off. Yeah I let my online friend pick what they want to do as I'm not picky and unbothered.

Uh, I don't know what else to cover and maybe fashion styles 😂

Yeah, it would be cool to have online male friends that dress in cozy joggers, cheap alternative clothes style clothes from Walmart, Temu and Amazon 💀 and band t-shirts or graphic shirts of your favorite interest.

Yeah, I'm cheap. I just dress in black joggers and Walmart you can get emo/scene looking joggers or leggings 🤣 then I own 9 Sleep Token shirts, no I'm not joking I'd own 9 Sleep Token shirts and I've already posted them on my pro if you scroll all the way down.

Yeah, then I'd also own 3 Lorna Shore shirts, obviously I will just continue to buy Sleep Token shirts and Lorna Shore shirts.

The next thing I want to buy is a Sleep Token blanket, but those are sold out, VERY hard to find if you see them in stores and the next Sleep Token Shirt I need is a Take Me Back To Eden shirt and a Sleep Token Caramel shirt.

Yeah, I need to also purchase a Sleep Token long sleeve shirt and zip up hoodie if I can find one on sale-second hand that's official.

Yeah, with that being said no you don't have to have alternative tattoos or piercings. If you dye your hair that would be cool/great because I dye my hair and I don't ever plan to stop dying my hair.

Red velvet is next on the top part of my roots, then I'll have plans to dye my hair underneath the roots near the ends will be dark brown and my ends will also be dark brown.

Right now, my hair looks awful 🤣 Dyed my hair dark maroon in the middle of December with dark brown ends and just let's say the dark maroon is fading to a nasty color and way too dark 🤣

Yeah, just not my style currently right now, though I would give that hair color a try as I never dyed my hair dark maroon with brown ends and that will never happen again.

Here are some convo starters in my dms because there are some users that are uncertain what to say and these are just random conversations that you can just randomly put in your dms.

Yeah, these questions are REALLY random, but that's honestly the whole point 🤣

What are your favorite hobbies currently? What video games are you currently playing right now?

What video games would you recommend to me if I enjoy Splatoon 3, Fall Guys, Final Fantasy games and yeah I know there is Kingdom Hearts for the PS4.

Yeah, I found my PS4 recently in December and still works, obviously I need to get more games for the PS4 😂 Yeah, forgotten I've had this console just collecting dust 😂

Here are other random assortment of dms you could jump-start your convos.

Are you a guy that is into artsy things? Are you a guy that loves to cook? Are you a guy that loves to bake? Are you a guy that loves to garden and even enjoy painting?

That's cool, even more cool if I would ever make a guy online friend only of course that would pay paino. What if you could play me Dire Dire Docks?

Last conversation starters that would be a good jump-start would be.

Favorite sandwich toppings? What is your go to sandwich and least favorite sandwich? What is your favorite pizza topping and your least favorite pizza topping? What is your go to gamer snack and energy drink?

Least favorite gamer snack and energy drink that tasted gross/not good and you were hoping would taste good? Yeah, do you enjoy coffee? My coffee style is always iced, teas are always iced tea from Starbucks and hot tea at home.

Yeah, I go to Starbucks every-week in a half because I get a sandwich there, either an iced frappe and sometimes I crave a nice iced tea, obviously that can be expensive if I get that often with the sandwich 🤣

Yeah, I'd enjoy a French vanilla iced coffee from Mcdonadl's and sometimes enjoy an iced Caramel coffee from Mcdonald's, obviously what about you?

Yeah, I don't respond to hi messages, hi and 👋 emoji, obviously I'm quite unsure how to respond to that 🤣

Can we be friends if I listen to other genres of music?

If you're a fan of country or rap music, then I just don't know if we could match unless you would want someone that enjoys Lo-Fi as a second option besides a variety of rock, metal and core genres of music then 🤣

Yeah, if you don't want to hear about Sleep Token every single day and I could be just annoying at times for you, yeah I also do send emojis every few sentences and sometimes just 1 if you're annoyed by emoji usage as well.

Yeah, I know this doesn't help much/to make things better and I'm the type of person that won't give you poor conversations unless you tell me hi and ask a deep introverted person what she's doing every single day.

When my life is basically on a repeat loop with barely doing anything by choice and I don't have what you call a socialized family life by their own choices.

Yeah, I wonder how many people would want to hear someone text every single day. I just go on YT, listen to music and find something to watch on YT.

The next thing I'd do is either go on Pandora and then go YT for music, which I think I'm leaning on YT for music more than Pandora, I then listen to music for a while. Then I go back to YT or gaming.

The next thing I'd is I plan to next month buy Final Fantasy 12 Zodiac age because I've lost the game somewhere and I don't know if I'm going to get a new Nintendo Switch game anytime soon, sorry but band merchandise is more important imo ⭐

However, this is why it's probably best for one of us to pick up the conversation where one of us left off, rather than asking what's up every single day when sht don't change.

The thing is that users from this direct post need to realize as well I've no interest in meeting any of you in person because without going into personal details I live underneath the government rules and government funding to at least barely function and live off once-per month.

Which means in translation I'm too broke to see anyone in person and I also get interrogated by the government if I fly somewhere out of state.

Yeah, I'm not looking for a friend to permanently take care of me, what I'm seeing is just best friends on the internet and just give me a reason to look forward to the next day that I will be happy to receive your phone notifications.

The next comment I want to address is seeing posts that people are tired of being ghosted and disposed of close to a fashion trend and tired of that.

That's the sad thing about society culture now, that once someone no longer has a use for you and they got the conversations they wanted to have with you, it's onto the next person, rinse and repeat.

Why do you say on your posts on subreddits for friendship and other connections that you're looking for future best friends? That's weird you're asking for best friends right away and quickly.

Uh, do you know what the future means? That means far-away from now, obviously if you think we can become best friends in a week then that will be on you and not me and that's because.

Yeah, I no longer ask. Recently I made a friend on Tumblr which I don't use anymore who told me I shouldn't be saying the word bestie when we've been friends for two weeks and I should watch what I say to others. Yeah, don't ask me what their problem was/were, however there are some REALLY creepy people on Tumblr and I left.

Yeah, I left Tumblr after I met a crazy ex-person on there trying to compete with my Discord server, they even removed 4 people from my Discord server that were her spy friends apparently and moved them over to create their server. Yeah, after that I left, because this user had problems. They screenshot my bio on Reddit where I said I had DID and sent that out to my followers on Tumblr.

Yeah, I left. I'm not dealing with nuts and I'm not going to deal with someone that wants to hurt or cause drama for my Discord server.

However, let's move on from Tumblr drama and let's just explain what I mean if you would want to help provide moderation for the Discord server, the Sleep Token subreddit and the FB group I recently created. These rules are super-easy and trust me you won't be having high demands as a moderator in Arcadia.

Yeah, when I mean about helping run a Sleep Token subreddit, I mean just daily maintenance and no I'm not asking the moderators of the subreddit to check every minute of their life on the subreddit. The rules are simple/straight-forward/easy. Just check once or twice a day to check for this content on the subreddit that I've created.

However, you can let me know in a dms if this interests you or not and I think that's better off that way, obviously that is because I don't want you to feel disappointed that you're not interested in help moderating the Sleep Token subreddit community. The thing is, you don't need to be an obsessed or hyper-fixated fan of Sleep Token.

The thing that I'm asking is to make sure nobody is posting spam links, spam content, revealing personal information about the band members' real life names and obsession with the band members taking their masks off in a live show.

That's what I'm asking. If this interests you, then you can message me in a few days and I may/might ask if you want to help moderate the server if I feel confident enough to ask, if you obviously don't ask first.

Version II bio-the not super-pleasant topics to talk about before ending this post.

Yeah, I normally don't go out of my way to find a new band or discover a new band, unless someone tells me about a band to check out and if I'm using Pandora at the time. However, I prefer YT music though and not Pandora, however Pandora does offer to find new bands more in the que/recommendations,

However, that's not my main interest right now to spend money on YT music and Pandora music at the same time.

Yeah, my interest right now is just using my YT channel playlist that I've made instead of paying for membership for either of those apps currently. However, you may have a question on a post that I've made recently with this text. Sibling likes to argue about my music, hates my music, yeah we don't have that strong sibling bond anymore and have been falling apart lately, the sibling connection is close to a standpoint of ""we tolerate each other, even though we obviously annoy each other attitude.""

""We occasionally enjoy each other's company ever so often and not often is preferred.

Yeah, for 🎄 yeah, you guys already know that I've asked for Sleep Token shirts from my sibling (my sibling hates this band that I recently found out but tolerates my hyper-fixations) and I got some cute figures and stuffed animals from my sibling's spouses' family.

Yeah, I'd rather not discuss anything about this further, obviously this is way too dramatic of a response of why someone should hate a band.

My sibling says that.

Sleep Token makes her depression worse, sad sad and how can you listen to these awful lyrics? Yeah, you don't get even more depressed when you listen to this stuff my sibling asked me in the car.

Yeah, I just turned my sibling out in the car and said nothing.

My sibling even kept on skipping their songs on my playlist in the car.

Yeah, that's just extremely disrespectful and rude. Yeah, my sibling we only text 1-once or twice a week and that's all. We just don't have that sibling ''spark anymore.''

Well, I might as well go make a ''suitable playlist next time I visit my sibling and lucky that is super way off from happening.''

The only thing I'm going to add to that playlist is video game remixes and Lo-Fi tracks because I'm not going to put rap music on there and this is just how I'm going to fix things here.

Yeah, speaking of my music style, do I dye my hair and do I stick with the same color of hair dye?

My hair is dyed dark red at the roots and my ends dark brown. Yeah, I've been dying my hair this hair color for this whole year of 2025, as dark reds and browns are what is in my style of what I want to dye my hair color right now.

Yeah, this month though I decided to dye my hair dark maroon black and dark brown on my ends, obviously I'm HATING this color combo, because you can barely see the dark maroon color and the color is fading not in a pretty shade as I would've wanted.

Yeah, in January 2026 I'm going to find a red velvet hair dye and go back to my usual dark brown hair dye that I use for my ends.

Yeah, that's why I look for friendships, other connections online about music and that's because all my family members do is sht on my music and have told me in the past that this is how my music is to them.

This isn't my sibling, these are all my family members that I barely have any contact with unless it's an emergency that they think my music is this style.

My music is devil worshipping as well, summoning the devil, satanic lyrics and 1 of my family members thinks that the lyrics that I enjoy are a vast majority of bands sing how to summon a demon and all metal talks about the grim reaper and death 🤣

Get this, before the vast majority of the family members that I have had a lot of contact with and don't anymore for personal reasons, doesn't think I'm telling the truth 🤣

There is 1 family member thinks that vast majority of metal bands that I listen to are ALL singing about the grim reaper, worshipping the devil and even with proof that 1 family member thinks I'm lying and all metal bands are the grim reapers 🤣

Yeah, obviously does this make sense now why I've nowhere to turn to make new connections besides Reddit and Discord friends 🤣

Am I doing anything on the New Year?

No, maybe just ordering Chinese food or just getting me McDonald's and maybe buying a new Final Fantasy game, I've been missing playing Final Fantasy Zodiac Age and the game is lost, have been looking for the game for a while and I can't find the Final Fantasy game.

Well I'm not going to do anything but sit on my bed like a couch, try to complete the winter event on Fall Guys and maybe do a fast food order on McDonald's 🤣

What's your favorite and least favorite mobile order? Last thing you might ask is why won't you see anyone in person that you text on Reddit/Discord? Weird?

Not weird, I'm too broke being on SSI and the rules that I live in my state. I've to be responsible to pay for the plane ticket as I'm not allowed for others to pay for my plane ticket without getting my SSI in jeopardy and I could have my SSI check revoked.

The only thing I've money for every single month is paying my host home half of rent until I get my own government funding apartment that I've already applied for/got approved (just on a waiting list.) bills, whatever food stamps doesn't cover, band merchandise and video games 🤣

Yeah, I even have 1 online friend that I've been with for years and even told me that the reason why they never saw me for those 5 years is the lack of funds there isn't enough left over each month for a plane ticket.

There was an ex-friend of mine a month ago in November arguing with me that my family shouldn't treat me this way, it's unfair, he doesn't enjoy/like that my family life is toxic and we can't become friends anymore because of this vibe.

Uh, well can I say this for people that want to come in my life?

Yeah, you're never going to meet my family and you're never going to meet me in person unless you're highly interested in paying for your plane ticket, your rent car, guest are only allowed to stay in my apartment whenever I get my apartment either in 2026 in summer/spring and the start of 2027 for three days.

Yeah, the thing is you might reflect back on my post and say your online friend that you've been with for a few years is lying to you that they can't afford a plane ticket and probably doesn't want to admit that they don't want to see you.

Uh, that's false, quite insensitive for you to think that, quite insensitive for you to judge my online friend that I've been with for years that you don't even know and that toxic thinking is something I'm not into inviting in my life.The reason why my online friend that I've been with for a few years can't see me in person is this.

Currently without giving too much identifying personal information, which I will not do and provide is this.

My online friend that I have been friends with for a few years can only have a max of 3k in her bank with my online friend being on SSI (state by state is different, mine only allows 2k.)

With frequent medical bills that only half of my online friend's medical health insurance will pay, my online friend is taking expensive supplements that are helping with their auto-immune-diseases that they they've and taking care of their pets.

Then adding my online friend paying for their own groceries, bills, paying a car bill and trying to find a low income apartment to live in, obviously do you think by this point my online friend has enough money for a plane ticket?

Yeah, even my online friend had to get a part time job because my online friend told me that the only way that they can afford all this now with the rise of the cost of living is if they get a part time job and that even with a part time job they still can't afford a plane ticket. Which, let me say this and this needs to be addressed.

Yeah, I've been dumped in the past for friendships even though the friendships were online and got tired of me being broke and not willing to change to make myself not broke anymore, obviously not living on the government income anymore.

However, my past ex-friends that I met on BlueSky which I no longer have a BlueSky account and my previous forgotten account made announcements and acknowledgement to my post that I'm not going to change my financial lifestyle.

This was made as an acknowledgement in several of my past-posts and several users thought I was lying to them and I was going to change my financial ways of living.

Yeah, once they found out the truth that I wasn't all my friends left me in fall and the start of winter of 2025.

Yeah, don't ask me why people think I'm lying, not being truthful about my situation and why they think I've a high-dishonest rate about me, obviously when I've been too honest without giving personal identifying information and people won't waste their time on me.

However, I don't think that's in the right of me to tell my friend this.

''Goodbye, I guess I'll never see you because you've chosen your own living expenses over seeing me which has been a few years now and I guess you will never see me, end the text with a block.''

Yeah, I'm not doing that, I'm just like Brooke and I can't even afford a plane ticket to go see my online friend, obviously why would I do this to someone in the same situation as me?

That's just as bad as telling a friend you've been with for a few years that suddenly got a life-long illness, lost the ability to afford to go see you, lost the ability to only afford living expenses and medical care ''then you will say, this isn't for me and goodbye.''

Yeah, what you're saying and telling that person while dumping them is that you cannot handle this.

Yeahh, you've deep problems holding an online friendship unless it's frequent meetups and you cannot be broke.

Tips for messaging me in chat requests if you're uinsure.

However, let's end this on a positive note. If you don't know how to start your chat requests because you're too shy then maybe you can tell me your favorite pizza topping and least favorite pizza topping?

Yeah, you can also tell me your favorite sandwich topping and least favorite pizza toppings? Yeah, you can even let me know your favorite 🎄 or New Year's dish and even your favorite seasonal dish.

How do you enjoy your coffee? Favorite type of pasta dish, favorite energy drink and snacks when video gaming?

Yeah, for me I normally get Mcdonald's iced French vanilla coffee or caramel iced coffee twice a week. Starbucks I'd sometimes only buy something from Starbucks every week and a half or two because it's pricey because I love to have the iced teas and a nice VERY sweet frappe with one of their sandwiches.

Coffee at the house?

No, not often unless instant and I will be brewing a nice caffeine or caffeine tea every single day.

If that doesn't work you can let me know what games you're looking forward to next year in 2026 and what game you're currently playing right now.

Just let me know your favorite hobbies, interests and you can even give me a mini-bio packed of what you're into right now and you don't have to worry about being basic. Yeah, as long as you don't say hi/hello then you're fine.

Yeah, let's just text about life, your hobbies, interests, I want to know what makes you happy and just as much as I'm happy when you tickle my Vessel brain. Yeah, I'm looking forward to messaging you and if you're in your 20s, that's fine.",1,1767171452.0,u_Competitive_Creme510,0,1.0,False

Five stars, hundreds of glowing comments, people raving about how it changed their mornings. The thing broke after two weeks. When I left a honest one-star review, suddenly I'm getting messages offering gift cards to change my rating. What's real anymore?



My friend works as a professional reviewer for a tech blog. She explained the whole ecosystem to me. Some companies offer free products for reviews, which creates bias. Others pay for positive reviews outright. Some reviews are written by bots. Real negative reviews get buried or removed. How is anyone supposed to make informed decisions?



I've started looking for specific patterns now. Reviews with actual photos of the product in use. Ones that mention both pros and cons. Reviewer profiles that show a history of varied ratings, not just five stars for everything. Critical details matter more than star counts. She mentioned some international platforms like Alibaba actually verify buyer reviews more strictly on certain products. Still not perfect though. Do you read reviews before buying? How do you spot fake ones? I'm becoming more skeptical of perfect ratings than I am of three-star ones with honest feedback.",1,1767171370.0,Reviews,0,1.0,False

The two main characters were white men, probably under 25.  There was a crime spree and a road trip.  I remember they got a lot of money somehow and were living it up.  There was a scene where the 2 men are partying in a living room drinking and doing drugs.  Things get out of hand and they wind up murdering a man, possibly with a fire poker.  There is a shot of the victim on his back under a glass coffee table with blood on his face.  The movie ends in what I remember as a shopping mall.  The shopping mall detail I may be misremembering because there is a gun shop.  That seems unlikely in a mall.  The gun store is closed and the guns are locked behind a chain.  The more aggressive of the two main characters is trying to steal the guns and says something like ""if we get these guns we are home free"".  The movie ends with the calmer headed of the two shooting his now crazed partner and turning himself into the police.  When the police ask him why he killed his partner he says ""I don't know""",1,1767171225.0,whatisthatmovie,1,1.0,False

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm looking for friends only and trying to just talk to someone and maybe hang out online in my free time. I work blue collar but do other things as a hobby, like study computers and I have my own coffee bar.

I don't really bring any recent trauma, only thing is I have ADHD so I can be a bit spontaneous and talk about myself, but it doesn't mean I'm not interested in what other people have to say.

I haven't watched much anime in awhile but me and my partner are watching JoJo and I've watched some other stuff in the past, namely One Piece. I like dramadies and watch shows like Psych and House, and I mostly play games on PC, or otherwise Kirby Air Riders on the Switch 2. I've been looking for a non-serious duo to mess around in some games like SE5 or L4D2, maybe even Smite.

I genuinely do try to put the effort in. I can't always respond but I try to asap, and I'm a bit awkward and struggle with voice calls, but not forever. I'm looking for someone who wants to maintain a friendship but isn't stressed about things being perfect. Nothing is, no one is, I'm not going to ghost unless you're a threat or a problem and even then I'd tell you.

I'd love to talk about coding, games or anything else with someone. Big into math, too. I've got a cat and a bunny, with pictures!

Please, if you're going to reach out use Discord! That's all I ask, but you can message me on reddit first since it makes it easier 🙂 just tell me about you and link your post.

Speaking to governors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the party’s national caucus meeting in Abuja, Tinubu said he had discussed the proposal with US and European leaders as part of Nigeria’s security reforms. “I told them that definitely we will pass a state police to improve security,” he said, adding that he was confident the APC had the political strength to deliver the reform. The creation of state police would require a constitutional amendment and has long been debated amid concerns over funding, political abuse and oversight. Tinubu also reiterated his commitment to enforcing the Supreme Court ruling on local government autonomy, urging governors to ensure councils receive funds directly from the federation account, stressing that autonomy without direct funding was meaningless.

West African crude oil sellers are struggling to place December- and January-loading cargoes as cheaper and more abundant alternatives crowd the market, traders and analysts told Reuters. Around 20 million barrels of Nigerian crude and up to six Angolan cargoes for December and January remained unsold this week, reflecting a broader global supply surplus that has weighed on prices. Brent crude fell below $60 a barrel, its lowest level since May. Analysts say softer seasonal demand, high freight costs and shifting buying patterns are slowing trade. Middle Eastern supplies, helped by lower official selling prices and shorter shipping routes, are displacing West African grades in Asia, while Russia continues to dominate India’s imports. China has also turned to cheaper or closer alternatives, leaving January trade in Angola well behind average levels. In Nigeria, reduced purchases by the Dangote refinery ahead of January maintenance have added to the overhang.

Ghana’s parliament on Thursday approved amendments to the Bank of Ghana Act aimed at tightening limits on central bank financing of the government and strengthening the bank’s independence. The Bank of Ghana (Amendment) Bill, 2025 bars the central bank from purchasing government securities on the primary market and narrows the definition of emergencies that previously allowed lending beyond a 5% cap of the prior year’s revenues. Emergencies are now limited to force majeure events such as natural disasters, public health crises or presidentially declared emergencies. The reforms follow criticism of extensive central bank support during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, when Ghana lost access to international markets, inflation surged, and the Bank of Ghana recorded negative equity. The law also tightens board eligibility rules, enhances audit oversight and aligns with Ghana’s 2023 IMF programme to curb inflation and restore investor confidence.

Cocoa prices rose for a second consecutive session in New York on Wednesday as traders reassessed expectations of a market oversupply and tightening procurement conditions. Cocoa futures climbed 1.5% to $6,066 per metric ton, extending a rebound after losses earlier in the week. Sentiment has improved after Citigroup cut its forecast for a global cocoa surplus this season by 41% to 79,000 tons, signalling a tighter balance than previously expected. While cocoa deliveries to export ports from top producer Ivory Coast, remain strong, exchange-monitored inventories in the United States continue to fall. They are now at their lowest level since March, providing further price support. Prices could gain additional momentum from cocoa’s inclusion in the Bloomberg Commodity Index, which Citigroup estimates could attract about $2 billion in inflows in early January. Robusta coffee slipped 1.5%, while raw sugar edged slightly lower.

Zambia’s President Hakainde Hichilema on Thursday signed into law constitutional amendments expanding parliament, a move critics say could advantage the ruling party ahead of elections due in August 2026. The changes raise the number of members of parliament to about 280 from 167 by creating new constituencies, introducing 40 reserved seats for women, youth and people with disabilities, and increasing presidential appointees to 11 from eight. Critics, including the Catholic Church and opposition figures, argue the reforms were rushed through parliament and could tilt the electoral field in favour of Hichilema’s party. Civil rights activist Brebner Changala said the delimitation process could be used to entrench the ruling party’s strongholds. Hichilema, who is seeking a second term, rejected the criticism, saying the reforms were made in good faith after consultations and were needed because some constituencies were too large for effective service delivery.",1,1767170428.0,anime_titties,0,1.0,False

Your groovy waves

So primal that your shivering cells harken back to when we were in caves

Brutes, unlike us now

May you wear suits that are blue

Sharp like daggers

Dresswear making strangers want to learn who you are, where you're from, and what your square footage situation is

May your visions of murder be brief

Brought to you by low-vibrational astral entities in nightmares you perpetually deny

And may passion and compassion shine so bright like the time you accidentally opened the door to a random Church for no reason in particular to spot a band of what seemed to be Mexicans on stage playing a song who thereby immediately stopped playing, looked at you, and smiled at you with more warmth than your mother ever did 

And may you get kissed on the cheek more than twice but no more than five times over the course of the next 365 days

May your sweaters from Banana Republic not only last but *thrive*

Your wardrobe so fun, so fresh, *eclectic* yet classy

And may you understand - finally - that none of this is your fault

You didn't ask to be born

You're trying your best

May you understand and believe that you will fix nothing

Change nothing

Relieve nothing

You will not save the world.

You won't save supper or the crow with a broken wing outside the building where you work

You won't save bacteria

You won't do anything. Not a thing. Not this year or any year or ever or in any lifetime.

Ive bought ED on steam,and by chance i saw YT  video of SC getting VR  recently (what a timing).All i knew about it is usual stuff you can imagine ppl know  ( 13 years in making,800 mil/ scam game)  i decided to try it too

So here are my few observations ,tbh i dont have negative ones,most negative stuff comes from bugs.

 neutral / negative

\-ive spend those 2 days basically trying to setup VR  /setup controls on game pad(newer saw another game with so much options and keybinds )  but i think im almost there XD  


\- ive tried to do delivery missions to test / learn basics (i guess they are seasonal special ones? ) and managed  to complete it one time. Rn i kinda wondering what new gonna stop me  before  a earn any money in this game

\-ive crashed few times / ive Ejected myself 2  times while trying to turn of /on engines -on time in hangar  /ive fell under the map when i was picking up item / my multitool stopped working when i wanted to deliver present ( i couldnt pick them up for some reason ) game crashed 3 times and one server error

\-Maybe its  because my started ship ( mustang)  but i dont feel ship have weight to it it feels l most like using freecam to fly around. i liked this more in ED. you felt you are inside a heavy / working metal ship.i dont feel it here (again maybe its ship )

\- i think mediocre sounds dosnt help earthier, dont hear my engines starting of,or sounds of metal creaks  when going in to atmo or  quantum t.

\-Some ships designs ( but guess thats my personal view)  im more fan od ,,Aliens,, than mass effect designs

\-not fan on QT  visual ,it dosnt have this,, OOOOMPH,, feeling

  
Good /positive

\-Immersion and scale (especially in Vr ) Yeah this game is (going to be something special)Even all those all bugs i and redoing same mission over and over again i cant wait to go back and play it again

\-this is basically living in space simulator. in some strange way i felt a bit like in early years  of WoW. dunno why. 

\- PPl seems friendly end helpful ( ive played Arc raiders a lot recently ,so this is nice :D )

\-Idea of walking around your ship is great (not much walking in mustang tho:) cant wait to   buy something bigger

\-game looking great (i play on high in VR)  and it looks super nice

 sunset over planets/god rays/clouds  and i havent seen much yet. so i imagine more wow factor 

  
overall -man im glad ive bought this,i think im here to stay Sorry for long post

Ive finished my coffee /going back to work with some SC videos in the background

Prior to my first baby I had the textbook PMS after her everything went away besides the occasional fatigue and acne (maybe 3/4 max) no serious breakout. Which lead to why I’ve been having high hopes this month. Tik tok sent me down the rabbit hole of early testing and never again!!!! I’ve always tested after being late. I’ve had ONE test with a faint line everything negative. (Haven’t been using morning pee) 

We had sex a couple days before and days after. As far as symptoms everything seems different. Which is why I was having high hopes. Chicken smells, tastes weird, the texture is off. I don’t eat red meat I’ve been eating it for a week now & pizza! Store bought at that. I normally drink a coffee everyday I haven’t been tempted to make a cup in morning. Sore boobs, sore nipples, headaches, insomnia, mild subtle cramps. Today I woke up to my face covered in pimples! I look like I’m going through puberty. My face has never looked like this during pms not even before daughter. This isn’t my normal PMS. But the tests are negative so I might have to suck it up and prepare for my period in a couple days ☹️ 

I’m kinda sad. I was so excited seeing the faint line. Just a little rant my friends don’t get it & I don’t want to bore them with this conversation. ",0,1767169562.0,CautiousBB,0,0.5,False
1q07zvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1q07zvf/advice_appreciated_medication_side_effects/,Advice appreciated medication/ side effects,"I was diagnosed with ADHD earlier this year and told I showed both inattentive and hyperactive tendencies (mostly inattentive). I went to the GP first and they passed me along to a private company who carried out my assessments and confirmed I had ADHD. The GP originally pushed me for autism which I denied but after being assessed I started to notice things. (Which may explain why this whole process has been difficult because looking back there’s been several times where I should’ve pushed for a response or confirmed things but I just didn’t realise)

They started me on Elvanse 30mg and I titrated up to 60mg. Felt like for the first time ever I could get things done and it had such a positive impact. But I was lowkey ignoring the side effects I was having, I’m not very good at picking up on my body’s cues or understanding how I’m feeling so I don’t feel it was private company to blame. 

Once they was happy they said they’d pass me back to the GP where they would continue to prescribe the medication, I was having to request it monthly and then pick it up from the pharmacy, and just now today it’s just dawned on me, am I supposed to be paying for them? I have been since being passed back to GP. I wasn’t paying for them through the private company but I should’ve asked my doctor if I’m supposed to be paying but I have been, I can’t believe I’ve only just thought that today 

In my treatment plan it mentions monitoring and check ups for weight blood pressure etc. it also mentioned CBT so I think I had this idea that the GP would be more involved in my treatment plan. 

I started experiencing some bad side effects, I didn’t even realise how bad it was until I took a month break and then when starting on them again it really showed me. Awful insomnia, irritability, blood pressure increased (had low BP before) so the reading is seen as fine but it’s a big difference, tightness in my chest, anxiety and mood swings, excessive sweating, dry mouth I have to drink all the time, urinating a lot, water infections, I’ve lost a lot of weight too which I have been actively trying too but my appetite has been next to nothing and I have to force myself to eat sometimes, and really bad back / shoulder pain aching/ tingling in back and arms. This pain started 3 months into treatment, I had just thought I’d pulled something but this pain went on to torture me for the next few months. To a point where I had days I felt so fragile and achey. I have this weak feeling in general whilst on them but this could be not eating enough and sleep deprivation mixed.

Now i know this seems a lot, but as mentioned im not very good at recognising  what’s happening with my body, my GP pushed me to be assessed for Autism before the ADHD so this might explain that. I told my GP all of these symptoms in a online request and went into thorough detail about how much it’s impacting my personal and work life and I’m worried that my dose is too high and it’s impacting my health. And just getting a text message saying to speak to my psychiatrist was a feel kick in the teeth. Because I didn’t understand who they was referring to, so I put in another request explaining everything again as it will be a different person probably reading and that GP passed me to private company and then they passed me back so there’s probably even some confusion and I need advice. And once again they just sent me a text message saying to contact the psychiatrist… AFTER I TOLD THEM I DONT KNOW WHO THAT IS?? I was so confused did I have a psychiatrist at the GP or is this the company, and I was so sick at the time I didn’t have the energy to wake up again early morning and put in another I was on antibiotics for a water infection (not sure if this is somehow linked to the medication)

So my GP is aware of my ADHD and autism and prescribe me my medication. But when i realised that something was wrong 4 months ago and I contacted them they told me to speak to my psychiatrist. I felt so in the dark about this. It really makes me worry for those who also struggle with autism and adhd and give up. It feels like I’m supposed to know all of this and the process, and the amount of times this year I’ve had doctors or nurses seems annoyed because I can’t convey how I’m feeling and I can get quite emotional when it feels overwhelming and I can’t explain it. 

My mum ended up ringing up as I was quite sick and she asked who is her psychiatrist?? Because I was passed back to the GP and they must’ve accepted some agreement to prescribe in the first place. I felt quite brushed off and like these symptoms must not be that worrying and i must’ve just been making a mountain out of a mole hill. I thought half of these weren’t related until now im experiencing them again. The person my mum spoke to sounded unsure and just said yes when my mum asked if it was the private company and I’m just left so confused. 

It’s taken a lot of mental energy to go through this process not once but twice with being diagnosed with both, and when I first went with the idea I might have ADHD they put me down as “high risk” because I was mentally shattered. My GP pushed me to get assessed for autism and happily set me up with the private company. So it’s all quite confusing now navigating these things as it’s all so new.

All the symptoms I’ve previously mentioned my GP knows about, I even had a trip to A&E because my chest felt funny and heart felt it was beating so fast. I quit drinking, coffee, vaping and fizzy drinks to make sure it wasn’t causing side effects. I contacted the private company start of November and they booked me an appointment for start for December. They adjusted my dose to 50mg and I took a month away. I noticed in that time my shoulder pain that has put such a massive strain on my personal and working life began to disappear. I even went to physio and had a sports massage, it was so bad it would put me in a vile mood and I was in pain just doing my makeup in the morning. I am quite physically active, and with Elvanse helping with my binge eating I’ve lost 3 stone. But I can’t help but feel the whole process has been quite unhealthy. 

A lot of the reason that it’s taken this long is I’ve found it really difficult and a bit embarrassing contacting both Gp and private company. Both times I put in a request from Gp for the medication just told they couldn’t speak to me about it, but I had a while to wait to speak to psychiatrist and when I’ve searched online it always says not to stop taking it without consulting doctor first. I just can’t help but feel brushed off, like I feel these symptoms should’ve been picked up on ages ago, I’ve been to the doctors about my back and water infections heaps of times and I’ve mentioned all these other symptoms and I always tell them I’m on medication. 

I have a weight in next week and a review on the 13th. Maybe this is obvious to some but I just don’t understand should I contact the private company now? Maybe this could be my autism showing but when im given an appointment I just think yes I’ll wait until then because that’s the time I’ve been given and how I’m feeling is probably normal but all do this is just too much really

Again I want to clarify all the symptoms I have stated i didn’t know it was the medication, I had my suspicions but i just thought maybe I was just linking things that wasn’t there. I’m not very good at understanding my body’s cues or explaining that to doctors it seems. I guess maybe part of me was just seeing the best in it because for the first time ever I could get things done, and was succeeding and I stopped stress eating and picked up new hobbies and such. Whenever I have a medication review and they start asking if I feel anxious or depressed or irritable I’ve found that quite tough to answer because I’m not sure what is normal for me. Taking a month away has been an eye opener, and I wish I had done it sooner, but when I was brushed off by GP about taking a break and knew I had to wait a while and google was saying to stay on them I thought I had no other choice. 

This is quite all over the place, but that about sums up my experience overall, messy and complicated. I am very happy with my assessment and now knowing. I just feel there is so many things I don’t knwk and probably should, but I’ve had so many negative experiences it’s really tough contacting so much. I’ve probably had 10 GP appointments in the past couple of months which is a lot for me and I find it so draining and stressful. it doesn’t help when I’ve been told it could all just be anxiety and “general unwellness” and I just feel embarrassed and like I’ve wasted their time. One nurse congratulated me on my weight loss which suprised me in all honestly because I was expecting them to show a little concern with how fast it’s happened, I guess I’m just used to my family worrying all the time 

If anyone has any tips or suggestions I would really appreciate, it’s so difficult to speak to anyone and navigate all of this mentally and physically. ",1,1767169529.0,ADHDUK,1,1.0,False
