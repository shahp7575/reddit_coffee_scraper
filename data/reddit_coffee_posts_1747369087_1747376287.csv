Isabelle

I sat at the lunch table alone, minding my own business. I was the only one who wasn’t in Wolf Training 4, because I hadn’t shifted yet. I was 18… I should have shifted four years ago. I sighed. I looked out the window to see Caleb leading the team, almost as big as dad. That should be me. I was born FIRST. I got hustled by the Pale Lady, she seems to give the men in the family bigger wolves.

What about Michelle? Said Glitter, my inner wolf. She was right, I forgot about her. She was already 6’9 and the same size as Uncle Connor’s wolf. My other cousin Jason was just the tiniest bit bigger. The problem was that my Uncle Connor’s son and my Aunt Shelly’s daughter… and my Little brother were all stronger than me. They got their wolves on time... and I was still basically and Omega… a wolf who can’t shift.

People trembled when they saw them. Actually trembled. All my brother had to do was walk down the hall, and it would part like the freaking sea! I was only 5’1… I sighed, forking my food. I pray to the Lady that my mate is ginormous. Let him be so strong even I think twice when he growls. I thought angrily. Why did I have to be so damn small anyway?! I grumbled in my head.

“Hey” I heard the voice of a sweaty teen boy. He was about 6’5, grey hair, had a perfect tan, and had deep violet eyes. He was muscular, and had on the Jr Warrior uniform, but I wished he would scram. He wasn’t my type; I was waiting for my mate. I knew he wasn’t; it was instinct.

He sat down next to me, and I let out a big breath of air out my nose. Dad said to always give a warning. I flashed my fangs. He ignored.

“Why are you always alone, short stuff?” I cringed when he said that, but he didn’t take the hint.

I growled at him. “Piss off.” I snap. He ignored me again, and laughed a bit.

“What’s your name?” He asks, scooting closer to me, I had to fight Glitter not to bite him. My inner wolf was very dominant, and hated to be treated anything less than a future Luna… but I was the reason we couldn’t shift. My shortness once again, had gotten me into an unwanted situation.

“Isabelle, now just leave me alone.” I growl, picking up my tray to find another table. As much as I hated to submit…. He was bigger than me, and I didn’t have my strength yet since I never shifted. I made it up in my mind that I would try today, no matter what.

He grabbed my arm and made me sit back down. “Dude, fuck off, you have no idea what you’re doing.” I warn, I wasn’t bluffing.

“Why should I? How do you know we aren’t mates? I transferred all the way from GreenMoon with my folks last year, and the Harvest Moon is still 6 months away.” He leaned into my face, challenging me, knowing I couldn’t do anything about it… or so he thought.

“I’m done.” I say flatly. Caleb, this smelly boy is bothering me. I mind link. He didn’t respond. But I saw him leap to the back door of the cafeteria, and shift butt ass naked in front of everyone. It got quiet. He nearly ripped the door off its hinges.

“What are you doing to my sister?” His voice boomed but his eyes were still blue. His false calmness always unsettled me. He was actually a ball of rage because of his wolf Raakshir, but he was always quiet. He always listened first, then decided to rip you to shreds if your answer was stupid.

The light drained from his eyes as my brother walked to him, casually catching a pair of shorts from a teacher without averting his gaze off the guy. “I didn’t know!” He squealed, about to get up and run, but Caleb stopped and closed his eyes.

“If you run, my wolf will chase. you. Down.” The guy froze. Caleb took a deep breath. “Why would you think bothering an unshifted she wolf was a good idea? She rejected your advances, yet you ignored her warning.” He said this with no growl, but his eyes turned red.

“Holy shit… I wasn’t thinking…” He mumbled.

“You were, just not with your brain.” Sighed my brother, slowly clamping his hand around the guy’s throat. “I’m still not sure what to do with you.” He said, his claws came out his free hand, and the guy’s eyes were wide with fear. I sighed… I can’t have him kill him as much as I wanted him too…

“Caleb I just wanted to be left alone, not covered in blood… I don’t know what you should do, just give him a warning or something.” I put my hand on his chest. He looked at me, and let his eyes turn blue. He dropped him to the ground, and the Jr Warrior scrambled to his feet.

“You will get one warning. Leave the she wolves alone.” He growled, and everyone, even the teachers, showed their necks.

He ran off, disappearing once he went through the double doors. Caleb put his hand on the top of my head. “I’ll eat lunch with you big sis.” He said sternly.

I narrowed my eyes at him, but I agreed. “…Not a word of this to dad!” I hiss.

“Please, you know he already knows.” He said with a small smile. He sat with me until the end of lunch, and we both went to biology together. Classes went by slowly after that, and I was a little pissed. Why did he think that it was okay to bother me? I wonder did mom have to go through this shit.

“Caleb and Isabelle Charred report to the office.” Said the intercom in my last class. I grunted, and packed my stuff, going to see my parents.

Surprisingly, it was mom. “I’m pretty sure you know why it was just me who came inside.” She said with a small smile, sitting next to Caleb.

“Nothing happened mom.” I say honestly, sitting down in the office.

“I already know, so I came to pick you up. I want to show you something.” She smiled.

I walked with her out the school, getting bows on the way out. People respected mom because she was a good Luna. She was really fair, and didn’t judge people by rank. I hope my mate will be as fair. I sighed. Dad was in the car, his eyes were completely red, and mom put her hand on his cheek.

“Dad, I’m fine.” I complain, he didn’t care. To him, I was attacked… I sighed and looked out the window. We went to grandma and grandpa’s house. Dad parked and went inside with Caleb while mom and I went into the back yard. She motioned for me to jog with her.

The trail was really peaceful, but I didn’t recognize it. there were old cedar trees, pines, birch, and wildlife. This trail wasn’t even paved, it was just dirt covered with pine needles. Then I saw why she took me. It was a kind of shallow, but wide stream. It was crystal clear, with little turtles sitting on the rocks. “How come I’ve never seen this place?” I question.

“It’s a secret.” She smiled, sitting in the dirt. I joined her, looking at the scenery. “I actually found this place on accident the day I met your father. I was in my 20’s when I shifted, and even now, I’m a really small wolf. But it doesn’t matter the size, strength, or even when you shift, you’re you. Be happy with who you are, you don’t need to compete, and you have your family and the pack to help.” She said, and laid on the grass.

“This must be a romantic place for you then mom?” I ask with a smile, lying next to her, the sun was perfect, and the breeze from the water was cool.

She laughed. “…. No, if anything it was probably the most terrifying day of my life. I didn’t even know your father until that day, and I actually thought he was going to kill me.” She said mischievously, and I laugh, Dad is a furball with mom. It was hard to believe they started off so rocky.

“Mom, is it okay if I try to shift now?” I ask, and she hummed in agreement, sitting up.

I did not change because you are so small. Are you sure? She asks.

Yeah, unless you want to keep submitting to weak males. She growled.

I Quickly took off my school clothes, and the pain came like a shockwave. I felt my bones and muscles grow; I was getting bigger! I collapsed on the ground, but remembered the order dad used to sing to me, Head, spine, limbs. We had a hard time turning fingers to paws but eventually through trial and error, we got there. My scream turned into a howl, and it was responded by dad and Caleb.

I was my wolf now. I let out another howl, no idea what it meant, but it felt good to be in fur. I felt strong. I looked at myself in the water. I was beautiful, and really fluffy. My Lady I was a fluffball. I heard dad roar a warning of challenge. He must have thought that we were under attack, and mom laughed. I was confused why he roared at me a challenge, but mom patted my head before I could return it.

“Your father has never heard your true howls; he thinks you’re a Rouge too close to us.” She said, scratching me behind my ear. I thumped my leg on the ground and I should have been disappointed with myself. This was disgraceful, but Lady did it feel nice…

You’re fucking dead. I heard dad roar in a common mind link, which completely ruined my moment with mom.

Oh, to hell with it. I linked mom. As scary as it was, I challenged back, roaring, then coughing and drinking some of the stream water.

“Lady’s sake.” She said shaking her head.

Don’t tell him! I linked. I had had kind of a bad day, why not prank dad and my brother?

They barreled down the path snarling deathly howls that made Glitter nervous. She was worried that they wouldn’t recognize me, but I stood my ground.

Mom took off her clothes and folded them neatly by mine before shifting instantly. She was tiny, but honestly beautiful, having a dark gray back and silver legs. She was probably half my size, but she held her tail as Luna. I showed respect and made mine lower than hers, and we waited for them.

…. You’re so…. fluffy. Linked dad in confusion. He skidded to a stop when he saw mom next to me.

Sis you are still smaller than me. Said Caleb with an obvious smirk. His wolf looked like he was smiling at me. I was still the smallest, but at least now with my powers, I could defend myself. I would gain the scent of a strong wolf, making most think twice about messing with me. It would be a while before I shift as fast as them though.

Mom and dad touched noses, and he took our clothes for us, so we could change at grandma and grandpa’s.

It felt so good to run, and jump and howl. I was finally a wolf…. but how do I change back when I get there?!

# Chapter 2

Isabelle

It was a brisk fall afternoon, and I was nervous. Tonight, I would find my mate. it was the night of the Harvest Moon, a moon so sacred to wolves, that we aren’t allowed to fight. If you kill someone or hinder the process in any way, there is a chance that you could be cursed by the Pale Lady herself. It was especially so that tonight, as she would grace us in red. It was said that those who were born without mates before this moon, would get mates that were powerful warriors.

I didn’t really believe that. I never heard of the moon actually changing someone just because of the moon phase…. But then again, the Pale Lady blessed my bloodline and a few others with power. It was why I was a princess. It was why, when I got older, that I would be able to crush enemies bigger than me.

There was a howl in the distance, but I ignored it. It sounded like my Uncle. Dad and Uncle Connor are the Alpha and Beta of the pack, so he probably was protecting the border. Just because there was supposed to be peace, didn’t mean that the new wolves in the area meant well. They essentially chased them off during this time of year, but since I was so new to the shift, and still couldn’t shift instantly, I couldn’t help.

A few others weren’t allowed to help either, including our local supernatural officer captain’s adopted daughter Mini. Dad and Officer Jerold thought it was a good idea to let her participate, just in case she had a mate here, even though she wasn’t a werewolf. She was a gravehound, a kind of weredog, and she was smaller than mom when she shifted. Us three were pretty much the same height in a packhouse full of wolves that were taller than us by at least a foot, but it didn’t stop us from getting into shenanigans. I was friends with her since as long as I could remember, and she was probably my only friend that wasn’t family. Oddly enough however, she would blend right in with us, because she had black hair and honey brown eyes.

She was a shy girl, and I would often be the one to introduce her to new things. Today was no different. While dad and the rest were out, I was in my room with her. She was on her phone, and so was I, but I was trying to cheer her up.

“I don’t know Isabelle... what if I don’t have a mate? I’m not a werewolf.” She said shyly, out the blue. It didn’t matter. She was beautiful in her human form, and looked like a black Irish setter shifted. They would see her and be smitten.

“Good Goddess… chill, I know you do; you’re a shifter. Anyone under the sway of the Lady Moon’s grace gets a soul mate. And if it isn’t this year, then maybe next year?” I told her with a smile.

“I just hope I’m not rejected since I’m a hound not a wolf…” she said, looking out the window.

“So what! You’re the sweetest girl I know and whoever’s your mate should be grateful…Your mate would never hurt you. You’ll know him when you see him tonight under the moon.” I said, giving her a small shoulder punch. Nothing that would hurt her; she was my friend.

“…. Can I tell you a secret?” She said with a small smile. I was successful in cheering her up a bit, which made me smile. I nodded for her to continue. “I hope it’s Caleb…don’t tell him.” She said looking down, blushing like crazy. It really wasn’t a secret though; everyone saw her goo-goo eye him every time she came to visit. My brother was no more perceptive than a boulder covered in moss about it though.

“Alright, I swear on my fluffy hide.” I giggle.

The sun was going down, and the moon was already visible, meaning it was time. I took a shower, and Mini did in the guest bedroom. I intended on finding my mate as my wolf, it would be easier. Mini chose a blue short skirt with a white long sleeve top. I silently gave a small prayer for her, because I didn’t want her heart broken in case his mate is a strong Alpha or Beta female. That’s usually how it goes, but there was no telling. Maybe the Pale Lady would cut her some slack. It still hurt to shift, but it only took me 2 minutes to do it. We will find our mate. Said my wolf happily in my mind. I kissed my stuffed unicorn for luck, and we walked together out my room.

I didn’t care who my mate was, as long as they were strong. I had wanted a soulmate since I was in middle school, and now that I was 18, it was only a matter of time. Even neighboring packs came to dad’s territory tonight. So, with that many wolves around, I was bound to find him….

She walked down the stairs, while I trotted in front as my wolf. She had to open the door for me, but I still was next to her for moral support. There were well over two thousand wolves in this one pack territory, and everyone was looking for their one.

Dad was shifted already with mom, and he stood at the top step to common mind link the crowd that had formed.

Pack, Guests, and Visitors, you are all welcome. He boomed. Tonight, is the one night of peace. Tonight, is the night for us to venerate the Lady in our prayers, while the unmated find their true soulmate, mark mates form their bonds, and the mated share precious time with their cherished loved one. Go enjoy the festivities, we rented rides and carnival food. Enjoy. He said wagging his tail. I can’t remember ever seeing him do that, but there was a first time for everything.

Then I saw it. Caleb, as his wolf, had his head in Mini’s chest while she hugged him. The Lady does do favors… I silently thanked her, and looked for my own mate. I knew he would shift back soon, and I didn’t want to see him naked if I could help it.

Jason held Warrior Commander Marcy’s daughter, Ginger, in his arms, and Michelle was in the arms of a heavily tattooed man with blonde hair. I think that was Alpha Leon’s grandson, Martin. It made me want to search harder. I knew that my mate was out there, and damnit I wanted to be held like that. They were practically a breath away from mating right there, but I wanted that too. I howled, hoping that my mate would hear me, but no one responded.

I didn’t give up until the moon sank below the tree line. The event wasn’t over, but I had seen mostly everyone already in the arms of their mate… but I didn’t have mine. My wolf whined, and it made me whine out loud. If I was in my human form, I would probably be crying, but no one would know that.

With my head and tail low, I walked back to the packhouse. I didn’t want to ride any rides, or eat burritos until I wanted to puke with Uncle Connor, I just wanted to forget tonight happened. I walked past many wolves, who encouraged me here or there, but I didn’t really want to hear it.

I went upstairs into my room, shifted, and closed the blinds to my window. The sun would be up soon, and I didn’t want the light in my tear-stained eyes. Sleep was hard to grasp, but I drifted off holding my stuffed unicorn I’d had since I was 5.

My eyes popped open to reveal that I was in the forest, with a backpack. I was camping… how did I get here? I looked around, getting out of the sleeping bag. There were dense, thick oaks that looked like they were hundreds of years old alongside tall pines and red cedars. I could almost smell the woods around me as it began to pitter-patter rain on the yellow tent. There was rabbit on the fire, and there was a howl that scattered the birds from the trees.

Whoever it was, I didn’t recognize him.

I saw the silhouette of a broad shouldered, powerful looking man. I couldn’t see his face, and I didn’t know where I was, but I did know that that had to be my mate, at least I hoped… he was a monster of a man. He intimidated me. I could only stand there. This male was so powerful, that he dominated me in my dreams. His eyes were crimson with his wolf, and he shifted, running toward me.

I bolted awake, falling out my bed. Was I dreaming? It felt so real! He almost got me… He was definitely some kind of Alpha or Beta that was for sure. I would talk to my parents about this, but in the meantime, I had responsibilities to do. I was the only one up, because everyone else was probably hammered from the night before, or sick from the greasy carnival food.

“Izzy don’t worry, you’ll find him next year.” Said Dad full of encouragement. He was on the way to his office, and we just so happened to cross paths. He had a fresh cup of coffee, but he put it in my hands. It was black and fresh, still steaming too.

“Actually, that’s what I wanted to talk to you about.” I said, taking a sip. I followed him and sat in his comfortable guest chair at his desk, while he made himself another cup.",1,1747376195.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False
1kntw8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdultChildren/comments/1kntw8h/mother_very_sick_in_the_hospital_might_have_liver/,"Mother very sick in the hospital, might have liver failure","My moms an addict, and her drug of choice is pills. She used to eat Xanax, Hydrocodone, Oxycotin, and Oxycodone like it was candy. 

She was a social worker and was friendly with a doctor who just threw whatever he wanted at her. He lost his license for doing stuff like that for her and some others, and he fled the country. She was taking the pills for a while, so when that stopped she was in a bad spot. 

She never went to rehab or treatment, she just had her meds majorly cut back so she wouldn't die and went about her life. 

Sometime after that is when she turned to alcohol. I did not notice how much she was drinking until 2022 because we go NC on and off. She has also always had health issues, and tends to over exaggerate things. 

This past year I noticed she was acting off. She would get confused easily, lose her train of thought, and do odd things. I assumed she was intoxicated. Now looking back, I think it was her liver. 

She is in the hospital now and not doing good. 

Her ammonia levels are 200, her liver levels aren't good, and they will be doing a MRI in the morning to see more but they suspect cirrhosis. She is also having a ulcerative colitis flare up, and they are concerned that she is having that many bowel movements and her levels aren't going down. 

She is completely delirious. 

Her eyes look like they are bulging out, and she has orange circles around her eyes. Her skin also looks pale and slightly yellow. She looks like she's 80 and not 57 years old. 

There are still test that need to be done, and more answers to find, but I feel so lost. I am 25, and my brother is 21 and on the other side of the country. We never thought we would be going through something like this. 

I have been doing some research, and a lot of it does not look good. Even if she bounces back from this, what does her future quality of life look like? How many years does she realistically have left? How sick will she be in those years? What do I do? 

The hospital said they would set a meeting with a case manager, but not until my mom is coherent again. So for now I just sit and wait to see what happens. 

I feel traumatized from what I have seen of her. They are having to clean and wipe her. They have coffee grounds all in the room, but the room just reeks of feces and coffee. I just feel so lost. I want to know how much longer she has but I know they can't just tell me that. This is horrible. ",1,1747376034.0,AdultChildren,0,1.0,False

I don't want to choose sides, what would you do? (LONG)","I’m making it sound like I’m fatherless, I’m not. I love my parents whole-heartedly, my parents love me with their life, but do they love each other? Absolutely not. Here's the story:

For as long as I can remember, my mom and dad would have heated arguements in front of me and my little brother (who is oblivious to all of this because they would argue in Tagalog, and he doesn’t understand it at all, so I have to bear the brunt of this mess). It got so much worse when we moved from the Philippines to Canada 2 years ago.

My mom is taking a college course, so she and my dad had to work part time jobs because they couldn’t work full time without a work permit (the process is long and complicated and caused my parents to stress which added fuel to the ongoing fire). My brother and I (we’re both still in school) help out around the house, but I too have a part time job (coffee shop barista $14/h which wasn’t a lot but was something). While my mom was juggling college, kids, a job, cooking all the food, and managing the household chores in general, my dad couldn’t even keep a stable job, and he barely helped with the housework. He was still in charge and would boss around my mom almost all the time.

Clearly, this frustrated my mom and their arguements would get louder and longer. But it all came to a point when my dad quit his most recent job. The reason being the work (construction/installment) was too much and was too heavy on his body (which I find a little strange since he’s really athletic and in shape basically since I was born). But it's his back and joints that were too painful due to early arthritis apparently from his body (coming from a tropical country with 40 C summers) not being adjusted to the ridiculously cold weather of Canada.

When he came back from a business trip, we found out that he had quit his job and doesn’t want to work anymore at all. Words cannot describe how frustrated and stressed my mom was at this point and started arguing again the day after he came back. In the end, she gave him an ultimatum: “it’s either you find a job and support us or leave this family and go back to the Philippines” (not exactly what she said but it was smth like that).

Obviously, he chose the “sensible” decision of going back because apparently, he would rather leave his family than to get a job. Don’t get me wrong, I love my dad, but this is just ridiculous. So for one long month, he has been lazing around the house while my mom was the one doing the work (again) and making arrangements for him to head back. During this time, I was actually dying inside, and my mental health was struggling. My parents have been together my entire life, why fall apart now? This was very difficult for me to process and go through especially when the people who raised you, cared for you, and loved you are now basically going at each other's throats. And I actually cried a lot the night before he left. What's worse is that I didn't even get to see him off at the airport because I was at school.

**It's been a month since that happened, it's just us 3 in my family now. But for the past couple weeks, my dad has been secretly texting me because my mom doesn't want us talking since she blocked his number on my phone and blocked him on my Facebook. We had been chatting through Instagram then and would check up on each other sometime. Recently he asked me a question, ""I miss all of you, don't you want me to come back?""**

I'm afraid to answer, I haven't answered yet, because I think that whatever I say about this is going to affect what happens in the future if I'm not careful. I don't want to choose sides, I don't want any part in this, this shouldn't have even happened in the first place like wtf. I just need these two to make peace. I don't care how, and I don't care if it's on good terms or bad terms, I just need all this to stop.

**But first I need to answer his question, but I don't know how to without choosing any sides. So I'd need some opinions or suggestion first**

Ella

“I’m sorry Ella.” My physician says gently. “I’m afraid you have very few viable eggs remaining. Frankly, I normally see these numbers in women ten or fifteen years your senior.”

“What?” I murmur, not believing my ears. I’ve been trying to get pregnant for years. I’m only 30, I should have plenty of eggs left.

“In terms of fertility, you have very little time left.” She continues. “If you want to conceive, you need to do so before your next cycle begins.”

“My next cycle?” I repeat, my mouth hanging open in shock. I love kids more than anything, and though it might not be everyone’s ambition, I want nothing more than to be a mother.

I have to get home and tell my boyfriend this news, and there’s not a moment to waste.

I make it home in record time, bursting through the door and opening my mouth to call for Mike, but stopping dead in my tracks. As soon as I walk inside I see a pair of high heels and a handbag by the door – neither of which belong to me.

I cock my ears towards the bedroom, and my stomach churns when I hear the unmistakable sound of moaning, accompanied by a steady thump thump thump, as the bed collides with the wall. Worse even than realizing that Mike is clearly in there with another woman, is realizing who he’s with. I know that handbag, and I know those shoes – they belong to my best friend, Kate.

“Fuck, Ella is so stupid.” Mike laughs, “can you believe she actually expects me to have a baby with her?”

Kate snorts, “she’s delusional. I don’t know how you put up with her for so long in the first place.”

“If she wasn’t so beautiful I never would have given her the time of day.” Mike scoffs. “Thankfully daily doses of plan B kept her from ever conceiving.”

“The morning after pill?” Kate asks, “how did you manage to give it to her without her realizing?”

“I put it in her morning coffee.” Mike chortles, sounding far too proud of himself.

My vision goes completely red as everything finally falls into place. Suddenly it’s clear why I’ve never been able to get pregnant, despite having unprotected sex multiple times a week for years. It’s even clear how I could have the eggs of a 45-year-old, if my despicable partner has been secretly feeding me emergency contraceptives every day – there’s no telling what other damage that might have done to my reproductive system.

Before I can think better of it, I pull the smoke alarm on the wall, wanting to frighten and punish the pair in the bedroom so fiercely that I fear I might attack them when they emerge. Water immediately sprays down from the sprinkler system mounted to the ceiling as a shrill siren fills the air, and I hear Mike and Kate cry out in surprise.

A few moments later they come rushing out of the bedroom, stopping in their tracks when they see me looming in the doorway. Mike’s eyes go comically wide, “What are you doing home so early?” The snake has the nerve to sound affronted that I surprised him, when he’s the one who’s been sneaking around behind my back for God knows how long. He seems to realize how suspicious it looks that he and Kate are standing there in their underwear and quickly adds, “Kate came to see me so we could plan a surprise for your birthday, but then we spilled coffee all over our clothes so we had to change.”

Fire blazes in my veins, he must truly believe I’m an idiot if he expects me to buy such a feeble excuse.

It’s a testament to their horrifically low opinion of me that they buy my act, and I vow to get my revenge one way or another. I can’t believe I wasted so many years – my best years – on this scumbag. And now he may have cost me my future too. As soon as the thought enters my head, I know I can’t afford to waste another moment on Mike, I have more important things to take care of.

I make my excuses and rush across town for the second time that afternoon, running to the comforting arms of my surrogate sister, Cora. Not only did we grow up together in the orphanage, but she became an OBGYN and now works for the most exclusive sperm bank in the city. I’ve never gone to her before because I always imagined Mike and I would eventually conceive the natural way, but that clearly isn’t an option anymore.

Even if I could find a man willing to have a baby with me in time, I’m not eager to trust anyone after Mike’s betrayal. I’m going to have to do this on my own, and I know Cora can help me. I don’t have much money, but I have enough savings to pay for the insemination, especially since I basically have one shot and one shot only.

When I arrive, all my plans to lay out my situation for Cora clearly and concisely go out the window, because the moment I see my sister I fall to pieces. She hugs and kisses me until my tears subside, slowly extracting the story from me piece by piece. When she hears about Mike and Kate she swears up a storm, but that’s nothing compared to her reaction when I explain about my fertility.

“That little shit! I’ll kill him!” She fumes, studying me with a worried expression. “Ella, if your doctor was right this means you only have one chance to conceive.”

“I know.” I sniffle. “And if this is going to be my only baby, I don’t want to take any chances. I want the best donor we can find.”

“Don’t you worry about that.” Cora assures me, “We’ve got donations from actors, models, scientists – it’s only the creme de la creme here.” She glances at the door and lowers her voice. “You didn’t hear it from me, but even Dominic Sinclair sent his samples here for testing.”

“Dominic Sinclair? I repeat, “the billionaire?” I’ve seen the man around town, but we don’t exactly run in the same circles. He lives in the same neighborhood as my wealthy employer and often says hello to the children I nanny, but he’s always surrounded by bodyguards and is so intimidating I get goosebumps just thinking about him.

“Oh my god!.” Cora slaps her hand over her mouth. “I wasn’t supposed to tell you that! I don’t know what I was thinking. Apparently he’s no stranger to fertility issues himself, and he trusted us to handle his swimmers over every other lab in the country. I’ve got his sperm in the other room at this very moment.” She frets, “But Ella you can’t tell anyone, you have to promise me.”

“Of course!” I agree immediately. “I know how important confidentiality is here.”

“Thank you,” Cora breathes. “Now, I’m going to give you a dossier of our clients so you can pick a donor, and once you’ve chosen we’ll get you knocked up before you can even blink.”

It’s not an easy decision, but eventually I choose a handsome surgeon whose photo practically makes me swoon. Cora leaves the room only long enough to prepare the sample, and though she looks a bit flustered when she returns, she quickly and professionally completes the insemination, holding my hand when the procedure is finished. “It’s all take care of now, Ella.” She promises, “You can come back in ten days to see if it worked.”

Ten days. I think dazedly. Ten days to decide my entire future.

If only I’d known that by the time those ten days were up, my future would no longer belong to me – but to Dominic Sinclair himself.

# Chapter 2 - Be Fired

Ella

Six days to go. I think, staring at the date circled on my calendar. Six days until I find out if my dreams are finally going to come true… or if I have to figure out an entirely different plan for my life.

I’ve thought about nothing else since Cora inseminated me last week, I’m so anxious to find out if I’m pregnant I haven’t even begun to process Mike’s betrayal.

I’m trying to keep a level head, yet I can’t help but imagine my future with this new baby. Try as I might, I catch myself daydreaming about it constantly. I even find myself humming as I get ready for work in the morning.

When I arrive at my employer’s estate in the most exclusive neighborhood in Moon Valley – which basically makes it the most exclusive neighborhood in the world, since Moon Valley is one of the most expensive cities on the planet – I’m immediately greeted by two little voices shouting my name in excitement. “Ella!”

The next thing I know, 3-year-old Millie is hugging my legs while her older brother, Jake, wraps his arms around my middle. “Good morning love puddles!” I exclaim, returning their hugs. “Are you ready for the museum?”

“Yeah!” They cheer, racing out the door without even stopping to put on coats. It takes a bit of wrangling to get them back inside and bundled up for the cold winter day, but before long we set out into the snow.

Jake races ahead of Millie and I, impatient to get to the science museum and not seeming to notice that his sister’s tiny legs simply don’t move that fast. Chuckling, I lift Millie into my arms and settle her on my hip. “Goodness, you’re getting too big for this, munchkin.”

“Nuh-uh,” Millie grins, “You’re justs too little.”

She might have a point. At five foot one, I don’t exactly have the kind of build suited to heavy lifting. I’m in great shape, but I’ve never been particularly strong. “Smarty pants.” I tease, laughing with the little girl.

When I look back towards Jake, I realize he’s stopped a few feet ahead of us. My heart skips a beat when I realize why. We’re in front of the Sinclair mansion, and its owner is currently standing in the middle of the sidewalk, his gaze searing me like a firebrand as I approach with Millie. Dominic Sinclair is just about the most handsome man I’ve ever seen, but he’s also one of the most terrifying.

With dark hair and piercing green eyes, chiseled features and a body so muscular I could swoon, it doesn’t seem fair he gets to look so good and also be so rich. If I didn’t know better I might think it was his wealth or imposing height that makes him so intimidating, after all he’s at least six foot four, which means he towers over me and everyone else around him. However it’s neither of those things, there’s simply an indefinable quality about the man that I can’t put my finger on, one which screams danger. He gives off this energy that’s so raw and animalistic one forgets there’s anyone else in the room.

Taking a steadying breath, I close the distance between us so Millie can say hello. When she greets him, Dominic drags his attention from me and offers her a smile so genuine that it tugs at my heartstrings. As I watch him talk to my two young charges, I remember what Cora told me about his infertility struggles. He clearly loves children, and I feel a wave of empathy for him. If anyone knows what it’s like to yearn for a family of their own, it’s me.

Jake is currently showing Dominic his new toy airplane, pulling the matchbox model from his pocket and demonstrating how far it can fly. With a great heave, he sends the toy gliding through the air, only to land in the middle of the street. Before any of us can say a word, Jake races after it, right into the busy road.

“Jake no, be careful!” I cry, watching him dart out into the path of an oncoming car but feeling frozen by my fear. Before I can contemplate putting Millie down to go after him, a blur of movement whirrs past my vision. I’ve never seen anyone move so fast in my life. Dominic became little more than a hazy outline of himself, chasing after Jake and pulling him out of the way just before the car slams into them. The vehicle’s tires are still screeching when Dominic sets Jake down beside me, his expression suddenly very stern.

“That was very dangerous.” He scolds gently. “You should never go into the street without looking both ways first.”

Jake hangs his head. “I’m sorry, I didn’t want my plane to get runned over.”

“You are a million times more important than a toy.” Dominic tells him firmly, “and you scared your nanny half to death.”

“I’m sorry, Ella.” Jake sniffles, looking up at me with wide eyes.

“I know sweetheart, just don’t ever do that again.” I breathe, cuddling him against my side. “Thank you so much.” I say to Dominic, feeling more grateful than I can express. “I have no idea how you moved so fast! It was like something out of a superhero film.”

“Must have been the adrenaline.” Dominic shrugs, giving Millie another smile before taking his leave. “Enjoy the rest of your day, and stay out of the road young man!”

“Yes sir!” Jake calls after him, pocketing his airplane. “I really am sorry.” He adds to me.

“It’s forgotten.” I tell him softly, though I take his hand so that he can’t run off again.

“It all happened so fast.” I tell Cora later that night. “I mean the more I think about it, the more amazing it seems. One moment he was there, and the next he was gone. It was like magic.”

“Thank goodness Jake is alright.” She replies, but rather than looking relieved, her face is twisted into a deep grimace.

Studying my sister’s expression, I realize her grim demeanor is not just about Jake’s near miss. Something else is wrong, and I actually feel guilty for not noticing sooner. “Is everything okay?”

Cora frowns, “Not really. But you’ve got so much going on right now, it’s not important.”

“Cora, don’t be ridiculous.” I admonish. “What’s going on?”

“Well, speaking of Dominic Sinclair,” She begins cryptically, “you know that sperm he sent to us for testing?”

“Yeah,” I confirm, wondering where on earth this was going.

“It’s gone missing… and I’m the last person who saw it, not to mention it was in my custody.” She explains, her voice becoming thick with emotion. “Ella, I think… I think I’m going to be fired. And if there’s an investigation I could lose my medical license.”

“What?” I exclaim. “What do you mean it’s missing? A vial of sperm can’t just get up and walk away.”

“I know, I think someone had to steal it, but there’s no way of knowing who’s responsible. And it looks like I’m going to have to take the blame.” She shares, her eyes shining with tears.

“Cora, I can’t believe you didn’t tell me this sooner!” I lament, “They can’t fire you, it isn’t fair.”

“You don’t understand, Dominic is one of our biggest donors.” Cora explains. “And he’s furious, he basically wants my head on a platter.”

A week ago I might have believed there was no hope for Cora, but seeing how kind and understanding Dominic was with the kids today makes me wonder if he could really be so heartless. Surely if he understood that Cora would never be so irresponsible he’d show some leniency? I have to try and help her, I would do anything for my sister – even begging a ruthless billionaire for mercy.",1,1747375314.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

I am looking for some advice. Essentially it is the question, if an Espresso machine is the right thing for me and if so, what machine would be a good buy for my needs.

Currently I mostly drink Mokka using a stove Mokka Maker (Bialetti) at home just with a tiny bit of milk / oat milk. As cup of my typical mokka at home is about 0.2l (small cup). My favourite Coffe buying outside is Flat white. I am not a gourmet coffee enjoyer, but I do know what a decent coffee (e.g. flat white) tastes like.

I am thinking what machine - if any - could fit my coffee needs. Although I occasionally drink espresso as well, most of the time I am going for a coffee just with that tiny bit of milk. As I drink about 3-4 cups a day, I am not aiming for anything that has tons of milk in it, but I enjoy foamed milk from time to time.

Also I want to invest a bit of time to try and find the right recipe, I do not see myself investing tons of time finding the the world’s best way of making coffee, nor do I want to invest too much time in machine maintenance.

At the price range of about 1k Profitec and Acaso came on my radar (besides they seem to make great coffee, I like the design).

## Summary

Here’s a quick overview of Tradlux Fame AI if you just want the key details:

## What is Tradlux Fame AI?

Tradlux Fame AI is an **automated trading platform** that uses artificial intelligence to analyze the market and place trades on your behalf. The idea is pretty straightforward: instead of sitting in front of your screen all day, reading charts and news, you let the AI do the heavy lifting.

The software claims to use **machine learning algorithms** to identify profitable trading opportunities in real-time. It can trade a variety of assets including **Bitcoin, Ethereum, forex pairs, stocks, and even commodities** like gold and oil.

Basically, if you’ve ever wished you had a trading assistant that didn’t sleep or get emotional about the markets—this is what Tradlux Fame AI is trying to be.

## Who Created Tradlux Fame AI?

So, this is where things get a little vague. There’s no well-known name or company directly tied to the creation of Tradlux Fame AI. That’s not necessarily a red flag—many platforms prefer to keep things low-key for competitive reasons—but I do wish there was more transparency on the development team.

From what I could gather, Tradlux Fame AI seems to be developed by a group of fintech professionals and AI engineers who’ve worked on similar platforms like **Bitcoin Era** and **Immediate Edge**. The interface and trading logic feel very familiar if you've used those platforms before.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Tradlux Fame AI Today](https://t.co/9rtMw72k1b)
## How Does Tradlux Fame AI Work?

The process is pretty simple and user-friendly. After you create an account and deposit funds, the AI starts scanning the markets using live data feeds. It looks for **patterns, indicators, and market signals** that typically precede price movements.

Once it identifies a potential trade, it executes it automatically based on the rules you've set (like stop loss, trade size, etc). You can either let it trade fully autonomously or set up **manual parameters** if you want more control.

The AI reportedly improves over time by analyzing previous trades and adjusting its strategy, which is a big plus. It’s not just a static algorithm—it actually learns.

## Tradlux Fame AI Pros and Cons

Here’s a balanced look at the good and the not-so-good:

**Pros:**

- ✅ Supports **multiple asset classes**
- ✅ **Low minimum deposit** ($250)
- ✅ Offers a **demo account** to test strategies
- ✅ Works on mobile and desktop
- ✅ **24/7 customer support**
- ✅ Fast withdrawals (within 48 hours)

**Cons:**

- ❌ **No info on founders** or company behind it
- ❌ **Risky like all trading bots**—wins aren't guaranteed

No need to download a separate app. The dashboard adapts to whatever screen you’re using, which is super convenient.

- **United States**
- **Canada**
- **United Kingdom**
- **Australia**
- **Germany**
- **Netherlands**
- **South Africa**
- **New Zealand**

## Tradlux Fame AI – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

Tradlux Fame AI scans massive amounts of live data and price charts to identify **entry and exit points**. It uses logic based on historical patterns, technical indicators, and momentum signals.

This means it can react faster than a human would and potentially catch quick market moves.

### User-Friendly Interface

The dashboard is clean, intuitive, and doesn’t overwhelm you with jargon. Even if you’re brand new to trading, you’ll find it easy to navigate. Everything from **account management to placing trades** can be done with just a few clicks.

### Mobile Accessibility

You don’t need to be glued to your laptop. You can check trades, make adjustments, or even withdraw funds from your phone while waiting in line for coffee. The mobile version is just as functional as the desktop one.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up email or SMS alerts for price changes, trade executions, and specific market conditions. This feature is super helpful if you want to stay informed without being constantly logged in.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Tradlux Fame AI isn’t just a crypto bot. You can trade:

- **Cryptocurrencies** (BTC, ETH, LTC, etc.)
- **Forex pairs**
- **Stocks**
- **Commodities**

It’s nice to have all these under one roof if you like to diversify.

## Is Tradlux Fame AI a Scam?

Short answer: **No**, but like any trading platform, it’s not without risk.

There are legit users making profits with it, and the platform doesn’t promise “get rich quick” nonsense like some shady bots do. It has a **demo mode**, transparent settings, and lets you withdraw your funds easily.

That said, **automated trading is inherently risky**. The market can be unpredictable, and no AI can win every trade. So don’t dump your life savings into it.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Tradlux Fame AI?

The platform requires a **minimum deposit of $250** to start trading. That’s pretty standard for these types of platforms and makes it accessible for most people.

We pretty quickly moved off the app and onto snapchat (which we both basically only use to talk to each other). I am recently out of a relationship so I kinda didn't ever bring up the topic of any sort of dating, plus our conversations are mostly pretty normal about things going on in our days/life but only occasionally did I throw in a flirt here and there. But one time she sent a voice note and OMG her voice I just- couldn't, it was so damn pretty and soft and relaxing. We ended up setting up a time to hang out one day we were both free (we were gonna go get coffee and hang out in a barnes and nobles) but I ended up having to cancel because I was just way too tired because of finals. The thing is we rescheduled it today, and after some issues with setting up an exact time we ended up meeting up at about 15 minutes till 7 p.m. She asked beforehand if it was fine if she hugged me when she saw me and omg, when I saw her she was legitimately so goddamn adorable *and* gorgeous. And her voice? LITERALLY better than the voice note which idk how it was possible. We talked basically the whole time about a bunch of different things, mostly about our lives and stuff that has happened in the past, but also some about our interests and our futures and our goals. I got us both coffee near the start and we just kept talking, hell it took me way longer to finish my drink than it usually did because she was just so fun to talk to. A few times the conversation went silent for a little but it never lasted long. Also we found out that we both had to take the same bus to get back home so we rode the bus together and just kept talking, we were basically talking nonstop for like 2 hours, and when she had to get off the bus she gave me another hug, which I didn't expect at all but I definitely am not complaining.

My name is Firman, and I’m a final-year Bachelor of Psychology (Hons.) student at Taylor’s University in Malaysia. For my final-year research project, I’m conducting a study to better understand how using online dating platforms—like Tinder, Bumble, or Coffee Meets Bagel—might be related to social anxiety.

Specifically, in this study, I’m exploring how engagement with online dating platforms (like Tinder, Bumble, or Coffee Meets Bagel) is related to social anxiety in young adults. I’m particularly interested in whether fear of rejection and upward social comparisons (i.e., comparing yourself to others who seem more attractive or successful) help explain this relationship.

Understanding these psychological processes could offer insights into how online dating affects mental well-being—especially for people in this age group.

*Sephie*

As Adrik and Ivan were walking away from the kitchen, I asked everyone’s input on the type of cookie I should be making. I had no idea they would all have such strong feelings on what kind of cookie they needed, but it turned into quite a spirited debate.

“I just feel like regular chocolate chip cookies are classic. Timeless, really,” Misha said. “Like me.”

“But they’re boring. And overdone. And sometimes you get one that makes you wish you hadn’t taken a bite of cookie,” Stephen said, which made Viktor laugh. His deep belly laugh filled the kitchen.

“Shortbread is the way to go. It might seem plain, but nothing made with that much butter can ever be bad,” Andrei said. “And you can also put frosting on them. Win-win.”

“I don’t know, I agree with both of you, but I feel like Andrei makes a very valid argument with the frosting,” I said, laughing at Misha’s indignant expression when he found out I agreed more with Andrei.

“You can put frosting on chocolate chip cookies, too,” he said.

“Feels like overkill that way,” Viktor said.

“I agree with Viktor,” I said, walking to the pantry for something. “What about you, Papa Bear? I feel like you’re a peanut butter guy. Simple, hardy, dependable, goes well with milk.” I could hear his deep laugh as I walked in the pantry.

“You’re right. It is my favorite. My wife used to make peanut butter cookies that she would dip in chocolate. It’s a miracle I didn’t gain 50 pounds the first year we were married. I think I talked her into making those cookies at least once a week,” Viktor said. He was smiling as he fondly remembered that period of his life.

“That sounds amazing, if I’m being honest,” I said, measuring out ingredients for the still to be determined cookies.

“They were. I don’t think there was anything special about them. It was just a peanut butter cookie, dipped in chocolate, but I couldn’t get enough of them,” he said.

“I’ll see if I can recreate them, if you like. But it might not be the same. The chef is always the secret ingredient,” I said.

Viktor smiled his sweet smile at me. “I will never turn down anything you make for me, sestrichka.”

I winked at Viktor, then turned to Stephen. I studied him for a minute, then said, “shit, yours is a chocolate cookie, isn’t it?”

He laughed. “Why is that a bad thing?”

“Because they’re actually the hardest to master. It sounds so simple, but you can fuck up a chocolate cookie faster than anything else. Of course that would be your favorite. They’re so deceptively complicated, but when it’s right, it’s divine. Not unlike you,” I said.

“I never would have guessed that talking about our favorite types of cookie would leave me so vulnerably diagnosed, but here we are,” Stephen said, laughing.

“What about you, spider monkey?” Andrei asked.

“Guess.”

Andrei thought for a moment, squinting his eyes as he tried to analyze me. “Sugar cookie?” he asked like he wasn’t sure.

“You’re not wrong, but you’re not completely right either. Keep going, Bubba,” I said.

He thought for a minute more, then I saw him get the answer. “Lemon sugar cookie,” he said, his wide smile stretching across his face.

I nodded, unable to hide my amusement at his boyishly handsome smile. “But why, though?” I asked. I didn’t think I would stump him with my question, but I did. It was actually Stephen that answered.

“Because it’s simple, sweet, with a hint of tangy. Not unlike you,” he said, smiling at me.

“Yoden for the win,” I said.

“I had the simple part, but it would’ve taken me longer to get the rest,” Andrei said, laughing. “Stephen might be as good as me at reading minds.”

“What about Ivan? What are your best guesses for his favorite?” Misha asked.

Stephen and I both looked at each other, grinning. “Biscotti,” we both said at the same time.

“Is that even a cookie?” Misha asked.

“It’s why it’s perfect. Is Ivan even a real person?” Stephen asked, laughing. It just so happened that Ivan and Adrik walked back in right as he said that which caused more laughter from everyone. Stephen apologized when he saw Ivan.

“Don’t apologize. I ask myself that question almost daily,” Ivan said, laughing with us. “What on earth are you guys discussing?”

“We’ve been debating what everyone’s favorite cookie is and what it says about them,” Andrei said, laughing loudly when he saw the look on Ivan and Adrik’s faces. “It’s actually pretty enlightening,” he said, defending our debate. Adrik just laughed, shaking his head.

He walked to me, wrapping his arms around my waist as he stood behind me. I had my hands full, so he rested his chin on my shoulder, watching what I was doing, happy to be near me. “I love you and your randomness,” he said, still chuckling.

“Bubba wasn’t lying. It’s been very enlightening,” I said, still laughing.

“What’s your favorite cookie, Ivan?” Misha asked.

“I don’t really like cookies that much. Or any kind of sweets. I never had it as a kid, so I don’t think I ever developed a taste for sweet things. But I’ll eat an entire package of biscotti if it’s in front of me,” he said, smiling.

“You heard them say that, didn’t you?” Andrei and Misha both said at the same time.

“Heard who say what?” Ivan asked.

“Stephen and Sephie said that was your favorite cookie before you two came back to the kitchen. That’s when I asked if it was even a cookie and Stephen asked if you were actually a real person,” Misha said, now even more amused with the conversation than he was before.

“I enjoy the fuckery as much as you do, Misha, but I did not hear them this time. I just heard Stephen ask if I was real. Still undecided, for the record,” Ivan said.

Adrik had moved to lean against the counter beside me, his arms folded across his chest. He was watching everyone, laughing at our silliness, enjoying a moment of peace before what we all knew was coming.

“Ok, what about Boss? Who can guess his favorite?” Misha asked. He was not going to let this conversation die yet and I loved him for it.

I glanced at Adrik, searching his eyes for a moment to find the answer. I smiled when I found it.

“Nope. Nope. Sephie’s not allowed to answer. She’s clearly cheating. Andrei can’t answer either. They have a clear advantage,” Misha said.

“You’re very bossy when it comes to cookies, my adorable Russian guardian.”

I watched Ivan and Viktor look at each other, then Viktor said, “it’s probably exactly the same one as Sephie. Maybe with a flavor twist, but he probably likes it because he knew as a 5-year-old that it was her favorite so he made it his too.”

I couldn’t contain my laughter. Neither could Adrik. “What’s her favorite, then?” Adrik asked.

“Lemon sugar cookie,” Misha said. “Was Viktor right?”

Adrik laughed. “He was. He was also right about the flavor twist. I like orange better. And they have been my favorite since I was 5. One of my father’s chefs used to make them for me regularly when he found out I liked them.”

“Why didn’t I think of that,” Misha said, shaking his head.

“If nothing else, we’re having the important conversations here. We’re changing the world right now, boys,” I said, laughing. I suspected my eyes would turn green, so I looked at Adrik when I said it. I recognized the look on his face, so I closed my eyes briefly, trying to switch them back to normal.

“As much as I’ve enjoyed this conversation, I also want to know what old friends you have in Panama,” Viktor said, looking at Adrik.

“My father,” he said. “I just called him.”

“I thought he was in Europe?” Viktor said.

“He was during the summer. He likes to migrate south for the winter,” Adrik said.

“So, his guys are going after Trino?” Stephen asked.

Adrik nodded his head. “I told him Trino would be there tonight, but he needed a day or two before they got him out, given the situation with his mom. He said he would send a team tonight to make sure Trino stayed safe, but they wouldn’t make contact for a couple days.”

“Does your father know Trino?” I asked, curious.

“He does. Trino was making a name for himself before I took over for my father. Trino made his move shortly after I took over, partly because we had already worked out a deal for after he took over. The guy he took power from was hated by pretty much everyone. It was in my best interest to support Trino. My father saw it coming a few years before Trino got the idea, although he wasn’t sure if it would be Trino or another guy that was similarly positioned as Trino,” Adrik said.

“What happened to that guy?”

“He still runs part of Trino’s business. He decided he didn’t want to be in charge when it came down to it, but he said he’d support Trino in taking over the previous guy,” he said.

“What happens after Vitaliy’s guys get Trino out of Colombia?” Viktor asked.

“We’re going to go fetch him,” Adrik said. He looked to me as he said it. I could tell he was uncertain about whether I’d be able to make the trip. Or would want to make the trip.

“Everyone is going to fetch him?” I asked. I knew the answer, but I wanted to toy with him.

# Chapter Two

*Sephie*

“Everyone is going to fetch him?” I asked. I knew the answer, but I wanted to toy with him.

“As long as you think you can make that trip, solnishko,” Adrik said, hesitantly. “But I would like you to meet my father.” He looked almost shy about his request. I could feel his uncertainty.

“Of course I’ll go. I would like to meet him as well,” I said, unable to string him along any longer. He relaxed as soon as I said I would go.

“We need to figure out security for Trino,” Ivan said. “He shouldn’t use any of his guys he has now going forward. It wouldn’t surprise me if they were all loyal to Martin now.”

“What about Chris or Keith?” I asked. “You guys have been training them still, right?”

“That might work,” Viktor said. “They’ve progressed in their training. You’d be proud of them.”

“You might have too many guys volunteer once they find out they’ll be spending their time in Colombia. I would imagine the winters there are much easier than the winters here,” I said.

Viktor laughed. “Most of our guys are from Eastern Europe or Russia. The winters here are mild, sestrichka. They all love it here.”

“Valid point. I do not know what winters are like in Russia. I’m also fairly positive I do not want to know what winters are like in Russia,” I said, pulling the cookies out of the oven. Misha was overly excited since I ended up going with chocolate chips, since that was the easiest solution for the evening’s bake. Andrei got up to make a fresh pot of coffee to go with the cookies. After pulling the cookies from the oven, I leaned against the counter, watching everyone again, enjoying the moment of peace. I loved that they had a place where they could talk about stupid things like types of cookies and just forget about everything we were facing at the moment. I knew how stressed everyone was. I was fairly certain a couple of them were having trouble sleeping. They were constantly on edge and tense. But they got a few hours to forget about it all and just be friends. It was quickly becoming one of my favorite things.

The kitchen grew quiet as everyone enjoyed warm cookies and coffee. We heard Adrik’s phone beep. Then we heard Viktor’s phone beep.

“You first,” I said, looking at Adrik.

He glanced at the message. “Trino is safe. He said to tell you that you already know how much he needs to thank you for making him leave tonight.”

I felt the tears welling up in my eyes as I thought about his situation. I knew how heartbroken he would be to lose his mother, but I also knew how much peace it would bring him to know he got to see her one last time. I wiped the tears from my eyes as Adrik walked to me, pulling me to him. I saw the look of surprise on his face as he held my gaze. I raised my eyebrow, trying to figure out what they were doing now. “They’re golden brown now. Almost amber,” he whispered, as he held me against him tightly.

Viktor’s phone beeped again. And again. And again. “Is that her or him?” Ivan asked, trying not to laugh.

Viktor looked at his phone. “It’s both. He finally got back to her and she responded. Andrei was right. She’s not happy he waited so long to respond.”

“What did he say about her going to Italy?” Misha asked.

“He’s not happy about us sending her anywhere. He says he’s still going to come get her,” Viktor said.

I stood up straighter, looking at Andrei, then looking at Misha. Finally, I looked at Ivan. “Is that fishy to you guys?” I asked.

“Very,” Ivan said.

“What do you want to bet that Martin getting Giana as payment is contingent on something specific happening here?” Stephen said.

“She’s not happy with that plan,” Viktor said. He got up to hand me his phone. “She must be cussing him out again, because I can’t imagine this is a situation that calls for dirty talk.”

“Maybe it is and we’re just so old now that we have no clue,” I said. I read through her texts. She could definitely type faster in Italian than she could in English. She sent five more lengthy texts in a matter of seconds. “Oh, she’s definitely cussing him out. She wants to know why he’s being stubborn. Lots of creative name calling, though. I’ll give her that. She says that if he comes here to get her, then there’s a chance she’ll die. If she goes to Italy, she’ll be safe. More name calling. More regret over sleeping with him. More threats of her trying to escape on her own. She also says she might escape and disappear on her own. She doesn’t need him. More name calling.” I looked up at all of their amused faces. “She’s very creative on the name calling. I didn’t expect that. It’s like her gift.”

Viktor’s phone was silent for a few moments, then Martin responded. I looked at the texts. He responded in Italian. “Well, that’s surprising. He’s responding in Italian,” I said, reading through his texts. I suddenly felt very sick to my stomach. “Oh my God…he’s threatening her.” I quickly handed the phone to Adrik then I ran to the nearest bathroom, hoping to make it in time. Luckily, most of the contents of my stomach had already been digested, but I did puke up the cookie I ate. Not gonna lie, one of the more pleasant puking experiences I’d had in my life.

I felt Adrik’s warm hands on my back. “Talk to me, love. What happened?” He ran his hand lightly over my back until I was sure I was done. When I stood up, he handed me a towel. I went to the sink to wash my mouth out and splashed water on my face as well. I groaned as I wiped my face.

“I don’t even like her but I’m scared for her. Martin is very much like Anthony, it seems. He turned evil on her quick. He told her that she belonged to him and he would decide what happened, not her. He said if she ever spoke to him like that again, he would arrange for her to be kidnapped and sold as a slave. It was her choice. She could either do what she was told or be sold off,” I said.

Adrik looked at me thoughtfully. “While I don’t like any of that, why did it make you vomit? You know we won’t let that happen to her, right?” he asked, turning me around to face him.

I looked up at him, not really knowing how to answer. I leaned against the bathroom sink, my hands fidgeting with the buttons on his shirt. I thought for a few minutes, still not sure of the answer. He gently lifted my chin, so I would look at him. He calmly searched my eyes, looking for the answer that I couldn’t articulate. I saw the recognition on his face when he found what he was looking for.",1,1747373439.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

I do want to meet him, but I’m also feeling really nervous at a situation alone with him. I’m a mum now and separated from baby’s dad. I feel scared about letting someone new in - not because he’s done anything wrong, but because I’ve poured so much of myself into people in the past.

Would it be okay if we just met for a casual coffee instead of something more intense? I know that probably sounds silly, but I guess I’m just looking for reassurance that it’s okay to ease into something gently - and that I’m not being weird for feeling this way. I almost want to say to him that I’m not sure if anything will go anywhere but that’s a bit intense. He may say, “Ah I’m only looking for friendship anyway”. I don’t know why I’m overthinking it so much. I just feel more vulnerable now as a mum getting to know somebody new. How can I meet him but maintain distance? It’s hard because I’m naturally an open, chatty person and I’ve given people the wrong idea before when I’ve not meant to.

Why ""Just Push Through"" is Sabotaging Your Motivation (and What *Actually* Works) 🚀","**Stuck in Hyperdrive? Why ""Just Push Through"" is Sabotaging Your Motivation (and What *Actually* Works) 🚀**

Hey MaximizeMe fam! 🌟

Ever found yourself revving your engine on a project, thinking, “I just need to power through”? Yeah, I’ve been there too. It feels heroic at first, right? Like we’re conquering the world, one coffee-fueled night at a time. ☕️💪 But what happens when that grit turns into grind, and your motivation is pretty much... *on empty*? 

Here’s the kicker: pushing through isn’t always the answer. In fact, it often backfires, leaving us exhausted and less productive. It's like trying to sprint a marathon—good luck with that! 😅

### Here’s why the “just push through” mentality might be sabotaging your motivation:

1. **Burnout Central**: 🚒 
   - Our brains are not wired to run on high speed indefinitely. Eventually, the gas runs out. Have you ever tried to work when you're completely fried? Spoiler: it’s not pretty.

2. **Diminished Returns**: 📉
   - That “just 10 more minutes” mentality? Great in theory, but often, you’re not delivering your best when your brain’s begging for a break.

3. **Lost Creativity**: 🎨 
   - When you’re solely in survival mode, creativity gets sent to the back of the bus. Motivation thrives on fresh ideas and enthusiasm, not exhaustion.

4. **Neglecting Your Needs**: 🥤  
   - Ever noticed how pushing through often leads to skipping meals, ignoring exercise, and generally feeling like a walking zombie? Yeah, self-care goes out the window, and we wonder why we feel like garbage.

### So, what actually works? Here are some game-changers:

- **Break It Down**: 🧩 
   - Tackle your tasks in smaller chunks. It’s like eating a pizza slice by slice instead of trying to shove the whole thing down in one go (trust me, I’ve tried, and it doesn’t end well).

- **Schedule Downtime**: 🕒 
   - Treat breaks like appointments you can’t miss! Even squeezing in a 10-minute walk or some mindful breathing can be a total reset.

- **Change Your Environment**: 🌳 
   - Sometimes, all it takes is a change of scenery. Working from a cozy café or even stepping outside can shift your perspective and boost your mood. 

- **Reflect and Adjust**: 💭  
   - Take a moment to ask yourself what’s working and what’s not. Regular reflection can help you align your efforts with your goals and recharge your motivation batteries.

- **Celebrate Wins, Big and Small**: 🎉 
   - Did you finish that daunting task? High five! Did you just *start* it? Double high five! Celebrating progress fuels further motivation.

We all have moments where we feel like we’re stuck in overdrive, but trust me, it's okay to take a pit stop. 😌 So what do you think? How do you manage when you start feeling that push-through pressure? Anyone else been on the brink of burnout and found a way to turn it around? Let’s chat! ✨",1,1747372459.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1knszcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1knszcw/recognizing_trauma_caused_by_your_narc/,Recognizing trauma caused by your narc…,"Trigger Warning : animal harm


— — — — — — — — — — — —

— — — — — — — — — — — — 


I left my narc late last year after reaching a breaking point with her that i wasn’t able to hide from, or bury in what little good remained…

I’m lucky enough to have the resources to have done this, and we didn’t have kids, but after 15 years… it obviously was a drastic change that required a transition in to a crisis mode to get through it.

Time has progressed, and I’ve set my self up somewhere else - the crisis has abated. 

Having been in therapy, I’ve been working through recognizing the patterns and coming to more and more terms with what such a significant portion of my adulthood has been - I feel that I’ve been finding the validation and tools to better understand and uncover what was going on for so many years… It’s helped me immensely as well as a few books which helped me identify the patterns initially.   

But something happened this week - I’m not sure what, triggered me, and last night when going to bed, I wasn’t able to rest, and I should have known, was feeling anxious - but I couldn’t figure out about what …. I eventually fell asleep, but woke up in a cold sweat at 6am, with a vivid memory of the dream I had.

In the dream - which was entirely metaphorical of our relationship - my wife, kills a kitten.    We had cats, and dogs, this behavior is completely the antithesis of who she is.   Despite the narcasissim, she wouldn’t harm an animal…

In the dream, after finding what she had done - I confront her, and she DARVO’s the whole scene, despite me having the direct evidence of what she had done.

It was a violent and dramatic and maximized metaphor of our relationship, where even the most minor things that she should have been able to take responsibility for, or even participate in the conversation in, about her role in - she would deny or displace or delay or worse, gaslight, and blame me… We all know the story.      But the dream took what was covert narcissism - not DIRECTLY violent or harmful,   and dialed it up to 11 in blatant clear depiction.  

Waking up I shook it off and moved the sheets around, and was able to force my self back to sleep.   It was one of those dreams you remember later…

I woke up late, maybe 930 in the morning - I wasn’t late for anything, but I rolled out of bed, knowing i had things to do.

I went to the kitchen, made my breakfast, and sat down in front of the TV to drink my coffee … and fully dissociated …

My phone beeped at 1115 when someone messaged me, and I looked up and realized the YouTube videos on my tv had kept playing, and my coffee was half drunk.  I hadn’t fallen asleep, and I can tell you what was on the TV…. But I can’t tell the order of things I remember seeing on it.   I couldn’t tell you why I sat there for over an hour, or that I knew how much time had gone by at all.

I spent all day feeling fragile and on edge.

All day with a brick behind my sternum.

All day feeling like I was forgetting something.

I was able to talk to a friend about it this evening - but it just made me realize what I was feeling more and more.

The trauma of the last 15 years of my life is cracking through, and it’s time to deal with it.

I guess I figured I could just grow past it.

I guess not.

We have to face our pains and our trauma - I have been trying to work through the transition and crisis, and let my self be distracted - but at some point the crisis settles.  The things that have to get done, are done.    And we’re left with repairing what was done to us.

The streets of New York were bustling with people.

I sat at the corner of the Meeting Cafe for two hours, facing the direction of the counter. A young girl in a sky-blue apron was busy brewing various drinks.

She was about 5'2"" tall, weighing no more than 90 pounds, with fair skin and a slender figure. She had a smile on her face, and her thick, black hair was tied up in a high ponytail. Her eyes were infectious when she smiled.

""Ma'am, would you like a refill?"" She walked over and asked me with a radiant smile.

""Black coffee,"" I replied, flashing a polite smile, my voice calm.

Soon, the girl brought me another cup of bitter black coffee. Instead of leaving immediately, she hesitated for a moment and said, ""Ma'am, you've already had two cups of black coffee. It may be refreshing, but excessive consumption is harmful. Maybe... you can come back next time?""

She was kind-hearted and outgoing. Her voice was clear and pleasant like wind chimes.

I glanced at the black coffee on the table, then picked up my bag and stood up. ""Alright, let's settle the bill.""

The girl was happy that I took her advice. She immediately went to settle the bill and said, ""Ma'am, your total today is $87.""

After paying, I quickly left the cafe.

""Madam."" Tim saw me coming out and nodded respectfully, opening the car door for me.

""Let's go home,"" I said to him with a faint smile.

The car started smoothly, and I closed my eyes in the backseat, images of the young girl from the coffee shop still lingering in my mind, recalling her youthful and radiant face.

Was it her? The girl who, a year later, made Charlie Bennett break ties with his family, pay a great price, and divorce me.

I never expected that the first thing I would do after being reborn was to find out where she works now and observe her like a voyeur.

I was too curious. What kind of girl could take away the man I had loved for ten years?

In my past life, I had never even met her in person. I only found out her name and saw a few pictures. Charlie protected her like a precious treasure, and I was utterly defeated without even facing my opponent.

Young, beautiful, pure, kind, outgoing... all these wonderful adjectives perfectly described that girl.

Her only vulnerability was the lack of a prestigious family background, a disparity in status compared to Charlie.

Suddenly, Tim spoke, ""Madam, today is your wedding anniversary with Mr. Bennett.""

I opened my eyes, momentarily confused. Let me calculate, it has been five years since I married Charlie. Every year on our wedding anniversary, I would be busy all day preparing a candlelit dinner and a wedding gift.

This year, I was 27 years old, and Charlie was 29.

""I know."" I rubbed my slightly uncomfortable temples. ""No need to remind me.""

Perhaps Tim sensed that I was different from previous years, which is why he reminded me.

But why was it always me who put in the effort? Why did I have to love that man? I had pondered this question before my death in my past life. For Charlie, I ended up losing everything in the end.

A miserable outcome.

I was lost in thought when the car had already stopped at the doorstep of mine and Charlie's house- the luxurious and grand mansion our parents gave us as a wedding gift. It occupied over a thousand square meters, a precious piece of land.

Surprisingly, Charlie's car was also parked at the doorstep today. He had returned.

My emotions were complex. As someone who had died once, when faced with the culprit after being reborn, what kind of expression should I put on?

I thought I would hate Charlie. For a woman, he had driven his wife of five years to a dead end. He had also dealt with my once incredibly doting father-in-law and mother-in-law, causing my family to collapse under his control.

However, upon seeing him again, I discovered that I didn't have such intense hatred. Instead, I felt a sense of relief.

In my previous life, Charlie had given me a chance. He proposed a peaceful divorce and compensation in the form of partial shares in the Bennett Group, enough for me to squander for a lifetime. But I refused. Even after ten years, I hadn't received a trace of his affection. Yet, with another woman, he became infatuated within a year, antagonizing everyone.

So, I tried every means possible to win him back, step by step, leading to our irreparable confrontation. A life and death struggle.

Those events had not yet occurred. Instead of harboring hatred, I wanted to change the bitter ending that I had brought upon myself.

""Why are you standing there?"" Charlie sat in the living room, casually crossing his long legs. The smoke on his fingertips had already burned out, and he skillfully put it into the ashtray. Then, he looked up at me, his gaze as indifferent as ever.

On our wedding day, Charlie had openly told us that it was merely a business arrangement between us, that we were just long-term roommates, and he had no feelings of love for me.

""Oh, nothing. I just didn't expect you to be home,"" I bent down to change into Hermès etoupe slippers. They had a simple design and a dignified color, but other than being comfortable to wear, they didn't appear particularly attractive.

I remembered the girl in the coffee shop. She was wearing a blue apron with a small red flower emblem. None of the others had it, only her.

In comparison, all my clothes were expensive but monotonous, exhibiting an unchanging simplicity and dullness.

Suddenly, I felt disgust toward these slippers. I threw them aside and walked barefoot into the living room.

Seeing me approaching him barefoot, a slight frown appeared on Charlie's forehead, and a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes. ""Aren't you wearing shoes?""

""Yeah, I don't feel like wearing them,"" I replied calmly, sitting across from him.

""It's quite strange. What triggered that?"" Charlie suddenly laughed. He used a rare, light tone to ask me that question.

I thought, ""Triggered by the person you will truly come to like in the future.""

I lowered my head to look at my own fair feet, which appeared somewhat dry due to excessive thinness.

Lauren Williams was different. Although she was slender, her skin was firm and elastic, unlike me, who was nothing but skin and bones.

Five years of lonely marriage had caused numerous problems in my body, and I had lost all interest in food. I was becoming thinner and resembling a witch more and more with each passing day.

""Charlie,"" I spoke up.

""Yeah?"" Charlie was engrossed in his phone, not even lifting his head.

No response.

He wore a black shirt and trousers. His slender figure and perfect proportions gave him a striking handsomeness. Combined with his smooth, refined, and deep-set facial features, he could be considered as someone that all women would like.

I looked away from my feet and stared at the man in front of me. My voice was a little husky as I said, ""Let's get divorced.""

As soon as the words fell, I heard Charlie's contemptuous laughter.

He threw his phone onto the sofa and looked at me with a familiar and indifferent gaze, asking, ""Rosalie Harrison, what game are you playing now?""

""I'm serious."" I sat up straight, meeting his oppressive gaze head-on. ""It's been five years, and you're never going to fall in love with me anyway. Let's release each other.""

Next month, there will be a large-scale business seminar in New York, and Charlie will be there. He'll meet Lauren, who will be working as a part-time hostess. It'll be love at first sight, and he'll stop at nothing to possess her.

I don't want to play the role of their legendary love story's cannon fodder anymore.

I have done what I wanted, what I could do, and what I should do in the previous life. I have already achieved the final result. In this life, I won't turn myself into a joke or drag the Harrison family into the abyss.

I decided to leave before Charlie and Lauren met to take the first step on their bumpy path of love.

Perhaps due to the seriousness in my eyes, Charlie's expression instantly turned gloomy and ugly. He has always had a bad temper, and if someone offended him, he would never show mercy.

""So I've become someone's toy now?"" He laughed, but there was a chill in his eyes. ""Five years ago, it was you who insisted on marrying me, and now, it's you who wants a divorce. Rosalie, are you playing with me?""

Five years ago, the relationship between the Bennett family and the Harrison family was perfect. It was a win-win situation for their business development and personal connections.

But with Charlie's personality, he could never be so obedient. The turning point was when the Bennett family's grandfather fell seriously ill and forced him to marry me.

It was a humiliation for Charlie, but fortunately, he didn't have anyone he truly loved. Moreover, he was in the process of taking over the family business and needed a wife who could help him develop his career, so he settled for me for five years.

I sighed with some sadness. ""Do you still want to continue this marriage, which is famous but empty?""

""Famous but empty?"" Charlie seemed to be pondering these four words carefully. Then he raised an eyebrow and sarcastically asked, ""Oh, do you feel empty?""

""No, I just..."" I carefully considered my words.

But Charlie had already stood up and come over to my side. He leaned down, resting his hands on both sides of the sofa, enclosing me within his embrace. His voice was somewhat tempting. ""If you feel lonely, why don't you talk to me?""

Charlie liked to smoke, and he always had a faint fragrance mixed with the scent of tobacco.

Of course, he never embraced me. I used to secretly smell his coat. At this moment, that complex and fascinating scent enveloped me. Ideally, I should have been excited and flushed with reddened cheeks, but in reality, I felt suppressed.

I was ready to leave him, so even a hint of closeness felt ominous.

""It's not about this!"" I tried to push him away.

""Is that so?"" Charlie snorted.

# Chapter 02 The Long-awaited Reunion

Charlie straightened up. He was never interested in me to begin with. The ambiguous teasing just now was meant to embarrass me. He won't lose his control.

I am a nearly thirty-year-old married virgin, emanating resentment rather than a charming fragrance.

""Rosalie, I know today is our fifth wedding anniversary, but I have no interest in all this. If you're trying to divorce me over this, I suggest you stop bothering."" Charlie stood in front of me, his voice turning cold.

""I haven't celebrated the anniversary for years. I didn't start bothering you for this."" I also stood up and looked at Charlie. ""Think about it, now my usefulness is almost exhausted. Compared to me, you need this freedom even more, don't you?""

With that, I headed upstairs to the bedroom without looking back, not wanting to say any more.

There was a rough closing of the door downstairs, followed by the sound of a car engine outside the window. I knew Charlie had left, but this time, I felt calm inside.

My phone rang. It was my friend Jane Donald calling.

""Rose, come out and play! Let's go to Song Garden!"" Jane's loud voice instantly dispelled my gloom. She is around the same age as me but has always been single.

After marriage, I rarely went out to play. Jane invited me ten times, and I could refuse nine times, but she was still very persistent.

""Sure!"" I readily agreed. There was a long silence on the other end of the phone.

""Today is your wedding anniversary with Charlie. Are you sure you want to go out?"" Jane's tone was full of doubt and astonishment.

I had used the excuse of wedding anniversary to refuse Jane for four consecutive years.

""Well, an anniversary is not a memorable day. I'll be right there."" I confidently answered Jane and hung up the phone.

Opening my closet, I saw a sea of black, white, and gray. Even blue was a rarely seen color. Behind every luxury brand, there are various wonderful designs, and I spent a lot of money buying the dullest style among them.

After ten minutes of pondering, I finally selected a less dreary strapless black dress. It had a silky texture, a deep V neckline that nearly reached my navel, and an elastic waist that accentuated my slender waist. My clean, white arms remained uncovered.

I remember buying this dress specifically to seduce Charlie. He didn't even come home for a month.

The only thing that dissatisfies me now is that my chest is too flat, which feels slightly mismatched with the allure of this dress.

I should eat more in the future.

I comforted myself. After changing clothes and applying makeup, I headed to the garage and drove a red Porsche straight to Song Garden.

During college, Jane, Tina Carter, Yolanda Davis, and I were known as the four talented women in the Music Department. Everyone thought that after graduation, the four of us would achieve great things.

However, I got married early, Jane became a regular at nightclubs, and Tina landed a vice-manager position at her family's company. Only Yolanda remained true to her music. She participated in music competitions everywhere and vowed to become a singer.

""You finally made it!"" Jane assumed a leadership pose, swiftly jumping off her high stool to excitedly shake my hand. The other two nodded in agreement, as I had almost disappeared from the social scene after getting married.

After a few drinks, Tina sighed, ""Rose, if you didn't come out this time, I would have thought that the event I attended five years ago was your funeral and not your wedding.""

""Strange! No candlelit dinner at home tonight?"" Jane curiously asked, prying her eyes open. ""Come on, let me see if that scumbag Charlie is still ignoring you. Have you been crying?""

""Don't pull off my false eyelashes, okay?"" I swatted away Jane's hand.",1,1747372232.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

It was early, no one else around. Life’s been rough lately and I was just… done that morning. I got emotional.

The officer (M, guessing early 30s?) was calm and kind. He took my license and registration, couldn’t find my insurance, and he asked for my cell number—wrote it on the registration, then went back to his car.

When he returned, he told me to step out of the vehicle. I thought maybe he assumed something was wrong with me. But instead, he told me to give him a hug. He said they see people going through stuff all the time and that I didn’t need to apologize so much. Then he offered to buy me coffee—multiple times. I said no, told him I was a school counselor and had to get to work. He even joked about getting me a doughnut, then circled back to coffee again.

He gave me another hug before I left. No ticket.

He was really attractive, and he stood close the whole time. I’ve been thinking about it ever since, and regret not saying yes.

Can I drop off a thank you card at the station and let him know I would like to have coffee sometime? Or could I be misread this whole thing?

My 69yr old mother was diagnosed with MM last March. She’s currently awaiting a Stem Cell Transplant. It took way longer than expected to reach this point do to insurance and issues with her name spelling across official sources and then dental clearance. 

She has been on a Valcade regimen since the diagnosis and luckily M protein and other markers have gone undetectable. So far so good 🙏 

The way we found out she had MM was a spontaneous fracture of her L1 and L2 and since the surgery to fix that she’s been mainly in bed for 20 hrs+ per day. It definitely took a toll on her body and mind. Prior to this she was very active at home always cooking and moving around, cleaning, calling relatives etc. Since all this transpired she no longer does or has the desire to do these activities or anything else for that matter. Sometimes she gets very happy and excited and will sit with us for a couple of hours. She doesn’t have an opinion on anything and doesn’t really contribute to much in conversation. 

Example: She’s been going to treatment every Wednesday for the last year. When my wife goes to pick her up, over the last 3 months she has become combative. She asks “Where are we going? Why are we going? Call my daughter and make sure we are supposed to be going.” In a very irritated tone very much unlike herself. 

Lately she’s become especially combative about her memory. She went to a dentist appointment today and my wife walked to a coffee spot she came back to her waiting in the waiting room. She had been in the waiting room for about ten minutes. My wife asked what they said, and what they did during the appointment. She said she just got an exam where they looked at her teeth. The doctor came out shortly after she arrived and he said they took X-rays, she has some root canals and some cavities that need to be done. They performed some tests as well on her teeth. But she did not recall any of those. 

The main reason I’m reaching out to the community is to ask about personal experiences and what to expect after SCT as well as potential improvement of cognitive function if you experienced any loss. She forgets everything from not remembering where she was picked and up from 15 minutes ago, instances of not remembering things from 20 minutes prior. She forgets things she was told the day before . She remembers the important things Name, Birthday, social security number, address things of that nature. 

I don’t know if this is because she doesn’t care about the other things and pays them no mind or because of the treatment and MM mixed with depression and anxiety. 

Please if you have any experience could you leave them below. Thank you so much.

They say if you die in your dream you’ll die in real life, I’m not sure I believe that though. But those were the thoughts running through my mind as I was jolted awake by the horrific nightmare, a nightmare that had been reoccurring for the last few weeks. In the dream I’m walking down a dark ally when all of a sudden I hear the foot steps and feel the rush of someone running up behind me, as I turn around I see the flash of a silver blade high in the air come down to stab me in the neck; then as I feel myself fading I awake in real life terrified and shaking. I haven’t had a good nights sleep in two weeks, and I guess tonight’s no different. I don’t have to be at work until later this afternoon so I could get a little more sleep but I’m too scared the nightmare will return; so reluctantly I get out of bed and start a pot of coffee and turn the tv on. Anything to get my mind off the dream. As the day goes on I start to feel better. Then it’s 11:30am time to get ready for work, my apartment is only a few blocks away from the mini mart I work at so I always walk; saves a lot of money on a car and gas. I’m only supposed to work 12-6 today, that is if Samantha actually shows up for her shift. Hopefully we’ll be busy today and I’ll get my mind off the nightmare for a little while. Well 6 o’clock came and went and no sign of Samantha, great I’ll have to pull another double; at least it’ll be extra money I can put up for savings. Finally 12am I can go home, I start walking down the sidewalk when I notice signs up for construction, I guess they’re getting everything out to get an early start, but now I have to detour down the ally of 5th and 6th street. No big deal, I’ve been down this ally before it’s short and there’s a 24 hour diner on the other side. As I walk a few feet I’m suddenly hit with the sickening feeling of realization that this is the same ally in my dream, maybe it’s a coincidence like I said I’ve been down this ally before but I couldn’t shake the feeling of a pit growing in the bottom of my stomach; so I turn around and head back to call an Uber and wait on the sidewalk well lit with street lights. But when I turn around I see a tall male figure standing at the end of the ally, I can’t make out any facial expression he just looks like a dark mass. Instantly as if my nightmare is playing out in real life I turn around pinching myself, this can’t be real, this can’t be real! But I hear the scurry of a rat behind the dumpster and I can smell the faint sent of hamburgers and fries from the diner. This isn’t a dream it’s real life, you can’t smell in a dream, can you?  Then I hear it, the foot steps running up behind me. The sudden breeze from someone rushing up on me. Without hesitation I start running, if I can just make it to the other end I’ll be under a street lamp and in front of the diner, I’ll be safe. I’m running but my feet feel like they’re in quick sand I can’t seem to go any faster, then all of a sudden I trip and fall hard to my knees my face hitting the pavement. Dern these messy allys, a single empty can of baked beans was enough to trip me up and lose whatever small lead I had on the figure chasing me. I turn around and see the ominous flash of the silver knife blade, this is it, my dream wasn’t just a nightmare it was a premonition. I’m about to be murdered. It seems like everything is in slow motion except my thoughts, my whole life is flashing through my mind. The dark figure is standing over me now and he pulls the blade back over his head and plunges the knife deep into my throat. I immediately start to cough and choke on the blood bubbling up in my mouth, it’s warm and sticky as it drips down to my shirt; I want to reach up and touch it because this still can’t be real it’s just my dream, but I’m too frozen to move. With too much blood loss, my heart beat is slowing and I’m unable to hold my head off the ground any longer, I let it fall hitting the pavement and turning to see the murder flee around the corner. And as my heart slows to a stop and I inhale for the last time, I’m suddenly jolted awake in my bed. Sweating and shaking from the nightmare. They say if you die in your dream you die in real life, I think I’m starting to believe it.

We must rehome our amazing, smart, and beautiful, pretty high percentage Great pyrenees (we did do his breed genetics for fun). He is a incredibly loved and wanted guy and this is a heartbreaking decision. 

He is a wonderful boy(fixed) who is about an est. 18 months old (per vets guess). But he unfortunately has bitten my teenage daughter more than once in reaction to things/fear. He bit her aggressively before and again tonight after he was irritated he had been forced into getting his fave washed in the shower and then after when he was out and laying down seemingly calm again, she saw something on his fur, went to get it off and it was stuck more than she thought and we believe it must have pulled his fur. He went after her and got her in the arm with puncture wounds in more than one area. I was right next to them and was able to grab him very quickly and he stopped and did not attempt again. 

Previous bite was when she pulled a coffee table towards her not realizing he was sleeping where she pulled it towards. This was soon after we had gotten him, and was a very aggressive reaction which required some stitches. He also bit our son minorly when he tried to pull a treat away from him that he was obviously guarding and we told our son not to try and take it. Our son is an adult. 
I am saying all of this to be very up front. He has been doing exceedingly well the last few months with no signs off aggression, until an hour ago. He has never had any aggression or any concerning behavior at all towards my husband or I. 

He is well trained. We paid for extensive professional private training with a year prgram, after he first bit our daughter, in hopes of being able to keep him. It was thousands of dollars and I am still paying for the last two thousand we didn't pay up front, in payments. I will continue to pay this if he has a good home where he can be loved as he still has some in home private sessions left in his year program. 

He knows heel, stay, down, come, paw, hug, leave it, go inside, off, free, etc. 

He walks beautifully and loves his car rides and his trips to farmer's markets. He loves his treats and takes them kindly. 
We just recently started swimming lessons for him so he could be safe playing at my mom's house. So far, he is not real fond of it. 

He does well with other dogs, but we only have small to medium dogs though besides him. He will bark at the other dogs if he feels they are not listening but is not aggressive. He seems to act like they are his babies and he is training them/keeping them safe. He eats at the same time in the same area as the other dogs and has no food aggression towards them.
He loves patrolling our yard perimeter and hanging out laying in the grass, he is used to two walks a day. 

He was found on the street of Phoenix at the end of last summer. He was matted, underweight, with no tags or microchip.

PLEASE, please, if you would consider being a forever home for our baby, please reach out. ANY questions please reach out.
We just want the best possible life for him.

Against protocol, I am here to warn you of bad times coming that I hope will change my timeline. Although admittedly, this was not our original mission, but seeing as how I am stuck here, I want a better future for my family. You can believe me or not, I don't suspect you would - why would you, a man travels back in time to post on the internet? Plus, from what I have seen of your society, I am not garnering much hope that anything will come of this. I'll start from the time when everything goes to hell for your country.

The Chinese have been manufacturing 98% of your electronics. Why did you all think that was a good idea from a country you knew was your adversary? None of us from my time can figure it out, although it's been heatedly debated. The Chinese have been implementing electronics that are highly sensitive to electromagnetic pulses, back doors, eves dropping capabilities in your communications equipment. After the Ukraine/Russia war ended, and boy did you all back the wrong horse there, Russia had become very hostile to Europe and the United States. In 2030 the Russians and Chinese got boost enough to strike and did so using a very strong EMP implemented from satellites - the EMP pulses burnt the circuitry of every computer device, televiewer, phones, walkie-talkies, life-saving medical equipment, every vehicle built after 1978, telephones connected by wire, kitchen equipment, air conditioning units, generators, you name it if it used or produced electricity - it was burnt to a crisp. This immediately sent the entire Western hemisphere into complete and utter chaos. Nuclear reactor meltdowns, fires from electronics burning out, no way to produce or even keep food, no way to communicate to other countries, no way to fly or even use a ship to go to European countries. You all went from a country to 350 million to 60 million in the matter of 10 years. America and other Western countries turned into a dystopian hell scape with no law or order.

But not all states had this problem - Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Texas, Ohio, West Virginia, Tennessee, New Orleans, Louisiana, and Mississippi worked together and rebuilt a lot of their power infastructure, they used old computer systems to set up BBS systems, got old vehicles and trucks running, old ham equipment to establish communications, laid new copper wire from state reserves - they even were able to save their Nuclear reactors and were able to find a way to repair the generators, replaced power lines and transformers, it took 7 years but a smaller nation was created with the new capital in Florida. These states did not have the population decrease like other states because most gun owners, hunters, fisherman, people who knew how to build and repair things lived in these states. They didn't have a lot of the comforts they had from before the attack - but atleast they created a safe society able to feed itself. 

After the 10 year mark from the EMP attack is when Russian and Chinese forces invaded America. However, and for whatever reason, their intel was very wrong. Russia invaded through Mexico up through Texas, while the Chinese beach landed in California and dropped Paratroopers across the United States. Texas was able to call on its other brother states and quickly repelled Russian forces - to their shock and disbelief. They didn't know these states had rebuilt so much, they didn't expect any resistance whatsoever. The Chinese had a much easier time practically taking over California and the entire Western half of America within 30 days. The paratroopers that landed in the new United States were quickly killed or captured. It only took 2 years to push most of the Chinese and what were left of the Russians all the way to California and finally out all together.

In 2036, when the New United States was able to get into the different experimental aircraft bases is when they found the craft they had developed using anti-gravity technology and because they kept in underground facilities, they were in working order. What they had found out was these craft were the reason for all the UFO sightings and was actually developed to respond to any nuclear threats - they could travel to any country almost instantiously - the best way I can describe how they worked is they didn't actually travel per say, they bent the fabric of space and stretched it so the two points would be close together and had devices on board that would shut down nuclear launch facilities and make them completely inoperable - and thats exactly what they did in fear of a nuclear strike from Russia or China. What our military in 2056 found out was they could also travel through time and thats where I come in.

We were sent here to only get more advanced electronic equipment and come straight back - however - once we arrived to this time over New Jersey, the goverment in this time somehow tracked us and shut our craft down leaving it completely inoperable. They desperately tried to find us using unmanned aircraft for months - I am guessing the drones had some type of sensors that could detect us - I am not sure how, I don't even know how they tracked us when we arrived. They confiscated the aircraft and we have been in hiding ever since seemingly stuck here and scared to death of your time's government. Although, since the new president has been elected - they seemingly had called off the drone search.

Thats all I got for now - this coffee shop is about to close and I'm a horrible typist. I apologize for spelling or grammar errors - I don't feel comfortable staying in one place too long. Take my warnings seriously - please try to change what is about to happen if at all possible.",1,1747370583.0,IAMFROM2056,0,1.0,False

Watching a movie with my parents in our living room, my dad’s phone rings. With a concerned look on his face, he stares down at the screen.

‘Excuse me, girls. I need to take this call,’ he says, standing and leaving the room.

‘Should we pause it?’ I ask mum.

‘No, it’s fine, sweetie. Dad has seen this movie before,’ she answers. I return my focus to the film in front of me, and I’m startled when I hear Dad’s tone rise in anger, in the other room.

‘No! That was not part of the deal! You can’t have her. I’m not going over this again with you. She is not for sale! The deal is off. Don’t contact me again, and stay away from my daughter,’ he yells.

I look over at mum who is just as startled as I am about dad’s phone call. I stand and leave the room, and find dad sitting outside near the back door, on the back steps, with his head in his hands.

‘Dad, is everything okay?’ I ask.

‘Yes, darling. Everything is fine.’ He lets out a heavy sigh. ‘Okay, so maybe everything isn’t fine. There is something I need to talk to you about. You know my business has been going downhill, and we have been struggling financially to pay even the basic household bills,’ he says, and I cut him off before he can continue.

‘Dad, it’s fine. I understand. I have two years left of my degree, but mum has taught me everything at her work, in the last few years. I haven’t learnt anything new at uni. I’ll defer my studies for a year or two. I’m sure I can get a part time job at a cafe, to help with the bills or even reception, or admin work somewhere,’ I say. Dad shakes his head. ‘No, Zurielle. It’s more complicated than that. I was offered a large sum of money to help someone with something illegal,’ he says.

‘What kind of illegal work? Are you in some kind of trouble?’ I ask, concerned.

‘I shouldn’t have accepted the offer Zuri-bear. They got me involved in things I’m being blackmailed for. I owe them some money. If I don’t return it, he wants you—’ he mumbles.

‘Who is he? What are they blackmailing you for?’ I ask, looking across at his teary eyes.

‘It doesn’t matter Zuri-bear. You’re my only child. You’re only nineteen. You’re the sweetest, kindest, most beautiful daughter I could ever ask for. I would never hand you over to anyone,’ he says.

‘Does mum know about this?’ I ask.

‘No, I’m going to tell her everything tomorrow. And everything else you need to know. I’m going to return the money in the morning, then we can let mum know. Over my dead body. I would never let him have you!’ He says. I nod.

‘Zuri-bear?’ Dad says.

‘Yes, Dad?’ I answer.

‘No matter what happens, don’t let any man fool you or use you. Men are the worst, most brutal species to exist. They’re nothing but heartless, monstrous beasts.

They only want one thing. To fulfill their desires and their needs. They will use you for your body and throw you away like a toy. Most men won’t care or notice you, for your kind and gentle personality, or even care how intelligent you are. They will see only your beauty and you deserve more than that. You deserve true happiness and a man who loves you for all of you. I know you will make me proud one day. You’ll find a man who is deserving of you. Always remember this, Zuri-bear,’ he says, and tears roll down my face.

‘I will make you proud. I will be cautious. I won’t trust just anyone,’ I say, and he kisses me on the forehead and caresses my cheek with his thumb.

‘I’m already proud of you, Zuri-bear,’ he says, softly.

‘You missed the rest of the movie,’ Mum says, as she approaches us.

‘It’s okay. We can watch another movie tomorrow, if you like?’ I say.

‘Okay. But I’m choosing the next movie,’ she says, smiling. ‘Okay. As long as it’s not a cheesy, unrealistic, romance movie that would never happen in real life,’ I say, giggling, and Mum scoffs.

‘We’ll see. Anyway, it’s late, and I’m tired, so I’m going to sleep. Are you coming to bed, John?’ She asks, looking at Dad.

‘Of course. Good night Zuri-bear. I love you,’ he says, getting up, taking my mother’s hand, and leaving to go to their room.

I sit on the back steps, and look up at the stars and the moon. A shooting star goes by. I should make a wish!

‘I wish one day to find a man who loves me for me; my other half, my soulmate; a man in love with my personality, rather than my natural beauty, everyone strangely thinks I have,’ I say, smiling, and looking up at the stars.

Rue, my little shihtzu, comes running out the back-door, barking at the back fence.

‘Rue! Come here! There’s nothing there. Just a bunch of trees,’ I yell. Rue runs back toward me, I pick her up and make my way inside, to bed.

I wake up coughing, and to Rue barking. It must be the middle of the night. I rub my eyes, and notice smoke coming in under my bedroom door. Is that smoke? Why aren’t the fire alarms sounding?

I jump out of bed and open my door, only for thick smoke to fill my room. I can’t see past the smoke but I can hear fire burning things in the house. I get on all-fours and crawl towards my parents’ room, screaming out for them. ‘Mum! Dad! Fire!’ I yell.

I get to their room, only to find flames coming out from under their door. I’m hoping and praying they have climbed out their window. I have to get myself out. Rue has stopped barking.

‘Rue! Rue!’ I call out.

I hear sirens getting closer; the neighbours must have called the fire brigade, or my parents. I turn around on my hands and knees, and try to get back to my room to climb out my window, but it’s already up in flames. I’m struggling to breathe; I feel the heat of the fire starting to burn me. I crawl faster and almost reach the front door before blacking out.

I wake up to such brightness, I have to cover my eyes with my arm. I can hear beeping sounds, and lots of people talking, and walking around me.

I adjust my eyes, and squint up at the roof.

‘She is waking up,’ someone says. A few different footsteps hurry towards me.

‘Turn the light off,’ a lady says, and the room thankfully becomes darker, and I slowly sit up. My eyes are finally able to open fully. I look around, and take in my surroundings.

I’m in a hospital bed. There are two nurses and a doctor, standing at the foot of my bed, watching me in silence.

My head is aching, and I rub my forehead with my fingers.

‘Why am I here?’ I ask. The nurses give the doctor a solemn look, before looking at me.

‘Do you remember the house fire?’ The doctor asks. As soon as he mentions the fire, I have an instant flashback, remembering everything. I start panicking and cry, reliving it all. The doctor administers an injection into my arm to calm me down. I feel calm and groggy.

‘Miss Summers. I’m sorry you’ve experienced such a traumatic ordeal. You have been in a coma for the last six weeks; you weren’t breathing when the firemen found you just inside your front door. They found you just in time. They carried you out to the ambulance outside your house and performed CPR. We had to put you in an induced coma,’ he explains.

‘My mum and Dad must be so worried about me! Can you tell them I’ve woken? I’d like to see them straight away, please,’ I tell the doctor. His smile becomes a sombre line.

‘Miss Summers, I’m so sorry; your parents died that night,’ he says, and I burst into tears.

‘No! No, that can’t be true! You’re lying!’ I scream.

‘I’m sorry, Miss Summers. I wish I could tell you otherwise,’ he says, looking away sadly.

‘What about their funerals?’ I ask, crying. The doctor turns and opens a cupboard, where two urns sit.

‘Again, I’m so sorry, Miss Summers. No one knew how long you’d be in a coma for. They have been cremated as per their wish, in their wills,’ he explains. I become more and more upset.

‘We will give you some space to process all this, Miss Summers,’ he says, leaving the room.

‘Wait!’ I yell, and he stops and turns.

‘Yes?’ He asks.

‘What about my dog? Rue?’ I ask.

‘I’m not sure, but I can make some phone calls and find out whether Rue survived or not,’ he says, and I nod and watch them leave the room.

My mum and dad are dead; they’re gone! I’m never going to see them again. I wrap my arms around myself and cry, and rock myself, until I fall asleep.

When I wake up, it’s night outside. I reach for the call bell, and press the button. A different doctor from earlier enters the room.

‘Miss Summers. I’m Doctor Wells. The doctor you saw earlier has finished his shift, but he has a message to pass on to you. Unfortunately, your dog Rue didn’t make it. I’m so sorry, Miss Summers,’ she says.

I cry again. My little Rue is dead. My dad bought her for me for my sixteenth birthday.

‘We have told the police you’ve woken from your coma, but they won’t see you until tomorrow,’ Doctor Wells explains. I give her a look of confusion.

‘Why would the police need to see me?’ I ask. Doctor Wells instantly looks very uncomfortable.

‘Oh. I wasn’t aware you weren’t told, Miss Summers,’ she says.

‘Please, my name is Zurielle. Aware of what?’ I ask.

‘Zurielle. The fire was purposely lit; someone murdered your parents. Your parents had stab wounds all over their bodies. Their room was doused in petrol and set alight. The police are still trying to find out who did this, and why you weren’t stabbed to death,’ she says.

I jump out of bed and go into the adjoining bathroom where I vomit into the toilet. My parents were killed! Murdered! While they slept!

Over my dead body. I would never let him have you! Dad’s words resound over and over in my head, until I pass out on the bathroom floor. I wake up in the hospital bed, realising I was meant to survive the fire. Whoever killed my parents wants me!

# Chapter 2

The next morning, I pace back and forth in my hospital room, in my hospital gown. I need to know who the man who murdered my parents is. Is it someone I know? I think of all Dad’s work friends and associates. Damn it! He was going to tell me who it was the next day, before the fire happened.

No one really stands out as someone capable of murder. Dad only took me to work events with mum, if he absolutely had to. His associates and colleagues would always stare at me or attempt to flirt with me otherwise.

I ignored their advances, and pretended I didn’t hear them or notice them. I instead focused on listening to the speeches.

Dad would always thank me for being so graceful and attentive at work functions. He was proud I didn’t give any attention to the ‘hungry men’ or ‘beasts’, as he would call them. I assured him I was there for the function, and not the men. I wasn’t interested in pursuing a relationship with anyone anyway.

I’ve never had a romantic connection with any man I’ve met. Perhaps if they had a proper conversation with me, something would eventually develop. I’m not interested in them, when all they do is flirt. They don’t even ask how my day has been.

Doctor Wells enters my room with two police officers, and my stomach sinks. What am I going to tell them? That my father was involved in some kind of criminal activity? That he owed someone money? About the phone call I heard him have that night? The look on my face must say it all.

‘Zurielle, sit down and make yourself comfortable. You have gone quite pale again. I’ll bring you a fresh jug of water while you get acquainted with the police officers,’ my doctor says.

I sit back on my bed and feel my hands trembling. I clench my fists, hoping to stop the trembles. The police officers step closer, with sad smiles. It’s clear they pity me right now.

‘Zurielle, we know you have been through a lot, but it has been six weeks, and the longer we wait, the harder it will be to catch the person who did this to you and your family. It’s really important you answer our questions as honestly as you can,’ the female officer says, and I nod. ‘Do you know who did this?’ I shake my head, and watch the male officer take notes.

‘Did your parents ever say anything to you, that was out of the ordinary, that could be linked to their deaths?’ She asks. I hesitate at first, but then tell them about Dad’s phone call. I want them to catch this murderer. I want justice for my parents.

‘My father received a phone call the night of the fire. He was angry at someone. He told whoever was on the phone that the deal was off and to stay away from us,’ I explain. The officers give eachother a look.

‘Very good. Can you tell me everything about that phone call? Did your father say anything else about the matter?’ She asks.

‘He said someone lent him money to save his business. In return, he had to do them a favour; illegal favours. He said they blackmailed him after he helped them. They told him they wanted their money back or to hand me over to them,’ I explain.

‘Was your father involved in criminal activity?’ She asks, trying to disguise her shock.

‘I don’t know, I mean, I never saw him do anything wrong, if that’s what you mean? My father is a good man. He would never intentionally do anything wrong unless he was forced to,’ I explain, defensively.

‘Of course, but when you say he did illegal favours, did he elaborate on that?’ She asks, and I shake my head.

‘No, he said would tell me everything else I needed to know the next day. He said he would return the money first,’ I explain.

‘What did your mother have to say about this?’ She asks. ‘My mother didn’t know. My father said he was going to tell her everything the next day. He was also going to tell us who he lent the money from,’ I explain.

‘Tell me what happened later that night. Did you notice anyone lurking around, or any cars in the street that aren’t normally there?’ She asks, and I shake my head.

‘No, not that I can think of. Wait! That night when they went to bed, my dog Rue ran outside and barked at the back fence. It was already late at night so I couldn’t see anything. I assumed Rue was just barking at the trees moving in the wind,’ I explain.

‘What time was this?’ She asks.

‘I don’t know the exact time, but it would have been just after ten o’clock sometime. I called Rue back inside and I went to bed. I don’t know what time I woke up, but Rue was barking at my door, and I was coughing from the smoke. That was when I realised the house was on fire. I also noticed none of the fire alarms went off,’ I say.

‘Is there anything else you can think of that would help this investigation?’ She asks. I shake my head.

‘No, I’m sorry. That’s all I can think of,’ I reply.

‘It’s fine Zurielle. You have given us a lot of new information, which may give us new leads, as to who is responsible. Unfortunately, we haven’t found the knife used to stab your parents, or your dog, yet,’ she says.

‘Wait! I didn’t realise my dog was stabbed,’ I say, crying. The officer walks over to me and places her hand on my shoulder.

‘I’m so sorry for all of this. I have contacted some women shelters, that are going to help you out with some clothing, and with somewhere to live, when you’re discharged from the hospital. I’m going to give you my card, in case you need to contact me, or need to tell me anything else that might help solve this case,’ she says.

I take the card from her, and place it on the table in front of me, and watch as they leave the room. An hour later, a woman in her fifties enters.

‘Zurielle Summers?’ She asks.

‘Yes, can I help you?’ I ask.

‘I’m Debbie from the Women’s Crisis Centre,’ she says, with a smile, and I stare at her blankly.

‘I got a call saying you’re about to be discharged. They’re just finalising your paperwork. If you like, I can take you to the women’s shelter, where we can find you some clothes and a bed to sleep on,’ she says.

I look down at the floor, and remember the house we were renting. Everything would be ruined: all my belongings, all my photos of mum and dad, my piano; everything. I wipe the tears from my face.

‘I’m so sorry. I know this is hard, but that’s why I’m here, and why we have services to help get you back on your feet,’ she says, rubbing my back.

Debbie is a short, plump woman with a beautiful big smile. She is genuine, sympathetic and caring. She is very kind and lovely towards me.

‘Thank you, Debbie,’ I say, sniffling.

I go to the reception desk, collect my paperwork, and follow Debbie to her car. The drive to the shelter is silent.

We enter the building and Debbie takes me into the first room on the left.

‘You get a brand-new back-pack. These are leftover stock donated from factories. Over here, racks of clothing.

You can take as many clothes as you can fit in your backpack. Everything is mostly new,’ Debbie explains.

I go to the size eight rack and pick out a few modest button-up shirts, a few corporate skirts that almost reach my knees, and a couple of jackets that match the skirts. I figure they would be good for the workplace, and it’s important I find a job as soon as possible.

I find a couple of pairs of skinny jeans and plain white t-shirts. I go to the size ten rack and take a couple of hoodies; I prefer the comfort of oversized hoodies. They’re great for hiding in, and for detracting attention away from me.

I take a couple of underwear packs, and a few bras. I’m hoping for plain undies and bras, but they’re all frilly and lacy, and some, even a bit see-through. I blush at the thought of wearing these, but remind myself I’m lucky to even be offered these. I’d have to go commando everywhere, otherwise.

They have a lot of nice things here. They even have really cute, pink, fluffy bed-socks. I can’t help myself, so I put a pair in my backpack, along with some leggings. I go through the boxes of shoes, and pick a pair of plain runners, and a pair of black flats, with a tiny heel. I figure they’ll go nicely with corporate outfits. I’ll wear the runners with casual clothes.

I walk out of the room with a small smile on my face.

‘How did you go?’ Debbie asks.

‘Good. Thank you so much. This will be a good help,’ I say, grateful. Debbie smiles.

‘There are changerooms just in there, unless you want to walk around in your hospital gown?’ She asks, smiling. I blush.

‘Oh. Ok.’

I go into the change-room and step into some underwear and put a bra on. I pull on a pair of jeans, a plain white shirt, a navy hoodie and the runners.

I step out, and for a brief moment, I feel victorious; no longer naked, and quite comfortable.

‘Very good. Follow me to the next room, please,’ she says. I follow her to the next room where she hands me a gift bag. Inside, I find toiletries: a hair brush, hair ties, tampons, soap, razors, toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, and other little items. It’s really cute to find a bottle of pink nail polish in it.

‘Our rooms sleep two women in each room. They’re small, but it’s a roof over your head, until you find something more long term. We also have computers in this room, over here, where we will help you create a resume. We can print out as many copies as you need. People contact us with offers of employment, so sometimes the work comes to you. Now, just a few things. Some of the homeless women here are drug users or alcoholics. There is the odd fight, and some of your items may be stolen. Most women though, are victims of abuse, who have fled their boyfriends or husbands,’ she explains. I nod and smile.

‘Your room is over here. Number eighteen,’ she says, opening the door.

‘Hailey sleeps in this bed. Your bed’s the other one. You can put your bags on your bed, if you like,’ Debbie offers. I sit my bags on my bed and follow Debbie around the building.

‘The kitchen is communal; we all share it. The only rule is to clean the mess you make. You can help yourself to tea, coffee, toast; whatever food you find in here,’ she says.

A few women sit at the dining tables eating.

‘Ladies, this is Zurielle. I’m sure you will all make her feel very welcome, and Hailey: she is your roommate,’ Debbie says. Hailey has short brown hair and blue eyes. She looks close to my age. She waves her hand and gives me a smile. I smile and wave back.

‘Okay, I’ll leave you to it. Tomorrow I’ll help you with your resume,’ Debbie says, wandering back to her office.

I go to my room, lie on my bed, and stare up at the roof. I roll onto my side, and face the wall. I’m grateful for all this help but I’m feeling so overwhelmed, and I’m still processing the death of my parents and my dog.

It was quiet, no traffic, just me and the cop. I’d been having a rough week and I cried. The officer was calm and genuinely kind. Took my license and registration, asked for my cell number (wrote it on my registration) and went back to his car.

When he came back, he told me to step out of the vehicle. I thought maybe he thought I was under the influence or something but he said, “Give me a hug.” He said I didn’t need to apologize so much, that they deal with people going through things all the time.

Then he offered to buy me coffee several times. I said no because I felt awkward and wasn’t sure if it was pity or what. He said “maybe a doughnut?” and asked again if I was sure I didn’t want coffee. I still said no, told him I had to get to work. He gave me another hug before I left and no ticket.

He was standing close, and was really attractive, and honestly I’ve been thinking about it since and I wish I said yes.

Would it be weird to drop off a short thank-you card at the station? Not a big note—just something like “thanks for being kind, and if the coffee offer still stands, I’d like that .” Does that cross a line and misread this whole thing, or is that kind of okay?",2,1747370522.0,AskMen,5,0.67,False

There is nothing wrong with being a sugary coffee enjoyer (I can still mess up a vanilla latte) but I decided to challenge myself with this because I realized I was wasting 200+ calories on coffee sweeteners. Black coffee is amazing for your metabolism and also helps suppress appetite which is great for intermittent fasting. 

But anyways I want to share with you guys how I was able to achieve this and some tips for anyone who might find it useful

For one, I think hot coffee is easier to make yummy without sweetener, rather than iced coffee. I haven’t gotten used to iced black coffee yet, so I recommend hot coffee!

I started with an 8 oz cup of coffee with 1/2 a cup of 2% milk with 2 tsp of sugar 

Then, I removed the sugar and just kept 1/2 a cup of milk. 

I went down to 1/3 a cup of milk and then 1/4 a cup of milk, then just 2 TBSP of milk! Until I was finally ready to drink it black, I didn’t even notice a difference between 2 TBSP and fully black coffee tbh

For anyone curious, here is the calorie count for 2% milk! If you use non dairy milk it may be lower cal :)

a cup of 2% milk: 120 calories 


a tsp of sugar: 15 calories 

[8 oz, 1/2 a cup of milk, 2 tsp of sugar: 90 cals]


[8 oz, 1/2 cup of milk: 60 cals]


[8 oz, 1/3 cup of milk: 40 cals]


[8 oz, 1/4 cup of milk: 30 cals]


[8 oz, 2 TBSP of milk: 15 cals]


[8 oz black coffee: 0 cals :)]

1knsacf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Datehsvsingles/comments/1knsacf/lets_talk_routines_healthy_habits_that_make_a/,Let’s Talk Routines: Healthy Habits That Make a Difference with HSV,"Living with herpes (HSV-1 or HSV-2) may come with challenges, but it certainly doesn't mean your life is over—or even limited. One of the most empowering things I’ve learned since being diagnosed is that a consistent and intentional daily routine can make a huge difference. It’s not just about managing outbreaks; it’s about caring for your mind, body, and emotional health every day.

Whether you're newly diagnosed or you've been living with HSV for years, daily habits can help you feel more in control. In this post, I want to share some of the healthy routines and lifestyle tips that have helped me and others in the community reduce outbreaks, feel better overall, and live more confidently with herpes.

[Freepik](https://preview.redd.it/bcqz3dlln21f1.jpg?width=4587&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9b2533f5f8fd0bb6d0dc0609dc9f122354889f7)

# Why Does a Daily Routine Matter?

HSV is a lifelong virus that tends to stay dormant most of the time. However, certain triggers—like stress, poor sleep, illness, or even friction—can reactivate the virus, causing painful outbreaks or viral shedding. That’s why building a daily routine focused on **immune health, stress management, and personal care** can make a noticeable difference in how frequently you experience symptoms.

It’s not about being perfect 24/7. It’s about doing small, consistent things that help your body thrive and reduce the chances of triggering an outbreak. Think of your routine as a form of self-respect and empowerment, rather than restriction.

# Morning Routine: Start Strong and Set the Tone

**1. Hydration Before Anything Else**  
Starting your day with a glass of water may sound simple, but it’s incredibly important. Dehydration can make you feel sluggish and even interfere with your immune function. I try to drink at least 16 ounces of water before I even touch my coffee. It wakes up your body and gives your system a clean start.

**2. Consistent Antiviral Meds (If Prescribed)**  
If you’re on suppressive therapy like valacyclovir or acyclovir, consistency is key. Taking your antiviral medication at the same time every day helps maintain effective levels in your bloodstream, which can significantly reduce the frequency and severity of outbreaks. I set a phone reminder so I don’t forget, even on weekends.

**3. Immune-Boosting Supplements**  
Many people in the HSV community find relief with specific supplements. **Lysine** (usually 1000-3000 mg/day) is one of the most commonly used. It’s thought to counteract arginine, an amino acid that can encourage the herpes virus to replicate. Other helpful supplements include **vitamin C, zinc, vitamin D**, and **B-complex vitamins**. Of course, always check with your healthcare provider before starting anything new.

**4. Light Movement or Exercise**  
You don’t need a hardcore gym session. Even 10-15 minutes of yoga, stretching, or walking can healthily activate your nervous system and lower cortisol (the stress hormone). Regular movement is also great for circulation, mood, and immune resilience—all helpful in reducing HSV flare-ups.

**5. Mental Framing or Affirmation**  
Don’t underestimate the power of mindset. I like to write down one thing I’m grateful for or remind myself of an affirmation like, “I am more than my diagnosis.” It sets a positive emotional tone for the day, helping me manage stigma and self-judgment.

# Midday Habits: Fueling Body and Mind

**6. Choose Immune-Supportive Foods**  
What you eat can impact your outbreaks. Many people avoid foods high in **arginine**—like nuts, chocolate, and oats—because it may trigger outbreaks. Instead, they focus on **lysine-rich foods** like dairy, chicken, and fish. Personally, I found that eating more whole foods (vegetables, lean proteins, fruits) made a noticeable difference in how I felt. That said, food triggers vary by person, so keeping a food diary can help you spot what works or doesn’t.

**7. Check in With Stress Levels**  
Stress is one of the most common outbreak triggers. Even if your life is busy (whose isn’t?), it’s important to find ways to decompress throughout the day. I take five-minute breaks every few hours to just breathe, stretch, or step outside for fresh air. Meditation apps like Headspace and Calm are also useful tools for reducing anxiety and keeping your nervous system balanced.

**8. Don't Skip Meals**  
I used to skip lunch during busy workdays, but that only made me feel exhausted, anxious, and more prone to symptoms. Stable blood sugar levels support energy and immune function, which is crucial when you’re managing HSV. Try to eat balanced meals every 4–5 hours and include some protein and fiber to keep your energy steady.

**9. Stay Clean and Dry**  
Especially if you’re prone to genital outbreaks, it’s important to keep the area clean and dry. Avoid overly tight clothing or non-breathable fabrics. Moisture and friction can irritate the skin and create the perfect conditions for an outbreak. Opt for cotton underwear and gentle, fragrance-free hygiene products.

# Evening Wind-Down: Rest and Repair

**10. Gentle Cleansing at Night**  
If you’ve been sweating or have experienced friction from sitting or moving all day, rinse gently before bed and pat dry. Don’t use harsh soaps or scrub—this can break down the skin barrier and make it easier for outbreaks to occur. Aloe-based cleansers or just warm water can work wonders.

**11. Take Supplements with Dinner**  
Some supplements, like zinc or vitamin D, are better absorbed when taken with food. I’ve made it part of my dinner ritual to take any vitamins or antivirals with a glass of water to stay consistent. It helps my body wind down and absorb everything it needs to fight off stressors.

**12. Journal or Symptom Log**  
Taking five minutes to jot down how I felt that day—physically and emotionally—helps me connect the dots over time. Did I feel run down? Was I overly stressed? Did I notice tingling or other signs of an oncoming outbreak? This kind of self-awareness is powerful for prevention.

**13. Screen-Free Wind Down**  
Blue light from screens interferes with melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep. I try to put away my phone and laptop at least 30 minutes before bed. Instead, I’ll read, stretch, or listen to relaxing music. Good sleep isn’t just a luxury—it’s your frontline defense against outbreaks.

**14. Prioritize Deep, Consistent Sleep**  
Sleep is your body’s time to heal and reset. Lack of sleep is a major trigger for herpes outbreaks in many people. I aim for 7–9 hours of quality sleep per night, and if I can’t get that, I at least ensure my sleep is uninterrupted and comfortable. A dark, cool room and a calming routine help make this easier.

# What to Avoid When Managing HSV

While we’ve talked a lot about what to *do*, it’s equally important to mention a few habits that are worth avoiding.

* **Too much alcohol** can weaken your immune response and disrupt sleep.
* **Smoking or vaping** increases bodily inflammation, which may aggravate outbreaks.
* **Over-exercising** (yes, even that!) can stress your immune system if you’re not balancing it with recovery.
* **Skipping protection during intimacy**, especially when asymptomatic, still carries risk—HSV can be transmitted even without visible sores.
* **Shaming yourself**, especially mentally or emotionally. Internalized stigma is exhausting and counterproductive. You’re human, you’re worthy, and you deserve compassion.

# Mental Health and Emotional Resilience

Managing herpes isn’t just physical. The emotional and mental toll—especially dealing with stigma, disclosure fears, and dating anxiety—is very real. That’s why emotional self-care is just as important as physical care.

For me, therapy was life-changing. A therapist familiar with chronic health conditions helped me process shame and rebuild self-confidence. Support groups, both online and in-person, helped me realize I wasn’t alone. Communities like r/Herpes and PositiveSingles offer spaces where people share honest experiences without judgment.

Creative outlets like writing, drawing, or even meme-making can be unexpectedly therapeutic. And having one or two trusted friends who know your status and still love you completely? That kind of emotional safety is priceless.

# Navigating Intimacy and Relationships

Having herpes doesn’t make you unworthy of love, connection, or intimacy. In fact, navigating dating and sex with HSV has made me more communicative and honest than ever before.

Daily habits that support intimacy include:

* Being honest about your condition when the time is right
* Taking your meds consistently to reduce transmission
* Using condoms or dental dams
* Checking in with your partner about any concerns
* Practicing regular hygiene and staying tuned in to your symptoms

A loving partner will appreciate your honesty and responsibility. If they don’t, they probably weren’t the right one anyway.

# Weekly or Monthly Habits Worth Building

Besides the daily stuff, I also do regular check-ins with myself. Once a week, I reflect on what’s working and what isn’t. Once a month, I’ll review my symptom tracker to look for patterns or improvements. I also plan at least one self-care activity each weekend—like a hike, a movie night, or an Epsom salt bath.

# Helpful Tools and Resources

Here are a few things I’ve personally found useful:

* **Pill organizer** to stay on top of antivirals and supplements
* **Symptom tracker app** to connect triggers and outbreaks
* **Lysine cream** or **zinc-based ointments** for soothing tingles or minor symptoms
* **Reliable educational resources** like the American Sexual Health Association or trusted support groups online

# Final Thoughts: You’re More Than HSV

Living with HSV can be a wake-up call to take better care of yourself. It forces you to slow down, listen to your body, and prioritise your well-being. That’s not a punishment—it’s a path to living with more intention, health, and self-love.

Whether you’ve had herpes for one week or ten years, you’re not alone. Your routine doesn’t have to be perfect, but it should be *yours*. Find what works, adjust as needed, and give yourself credit for the progress you’re making.

It stood like a fractured memory - red brick fading beneath the weight of time, ivy clawing its way up white columns. Black shutters sliced against the glass, and pink roses bloomed without fail, their petals spilling a thick, botanical scent seeping into the heavy air.

My mother called it a fresh start - a place to begin again, flawless this time, without cracks.

Inside, the atmosphere always smelled like lavender and Dior J'Adore - soft, floral, a lingering richness even in empty rooms, her presence pressed into the walls. But when it rained, when the sky split open and wind swept through the garden, another scent would slip in - damp earth and fresh grass, wild and pure - a subdued reminder that chaos could reach even here.

But for me, it was a stage. A place where I learned to smile on cue, to keep my voice soft, to never raise questions. Silence was survival. And I learned to play my part.

I don’t remember much of Serbia - only fragments. I was born in a country called the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a name that already felt like a mirage, *there* but never quite real. My parents never spoke about it, never explained why we left. Just flashes - gray stone streets, the cold, wet smell of river mud after rain, my grandmother’s voice calling my name, her hands warm but always busy. I don’t remember leaving. I only know we did.

New York was supposed to be solid, but it became a blur - a storm of smoke, whispered warnings, and hurried exits. I was too young to understand. I only remember the ash - falling like silver snow, drifting against the windows. The stillness that swallowed everything. My mother’s voice, cutting but low, her fingers cold as they gripped my wrist. My father’s voice was a steady, unshakable murmur - “Stay close. Don’t look.” His voice was relaxed to the point of chilling. The curtains snapped shut, a sudden, final sound - the light cut off like a breath.

And then, the rush - boxes stacked like ghosts in the hallway, the sky outside a dull, iron haze.

We left one world I barely remembered for another I couldn’t understand. Serbia was a blur, New York a whirlwind.. Savannah was supposed to be peaceful.

My father called it a new beginning. My mother called it safe. But the tension followed us - silent, a phantom trailing beneath the polished floors

Sunday mornings were the only time the house ever felt alive. My father would start it - carefully lowering the needle onto the record player, a soft crackle before the music burst to life. Prince’s electric pulse, Whitney Houston’s soaring voice, Fleetwood Mac’s tangled, bittersweet harmonies. My mother would sway first, her movements light, almost shy, but then my father would take her hand, spinning her across the kitchen floor. She’d laugh - an unguarded sound I rarely heard - and for a few songs, they weren’t careful or distant. They were just them. The twins would dart around their legs, clumsy but unstoppable, their giggles mixing with the music.

Chores didn’t feel like work - dishes clinking to the beat, sunlight spilling across the polished floors, the smell of fresh coffee and warm toast. And I’d stand by the window, watching it all - the way my father dipped my mother, her head thrown back in laughter, the way his expression softened. For a few songs, everything else disappeared. For a few songs, we were a family.

Dinner was a quiet dance of expectations. The table’s polished surface caught the light, silver cutlery glinting with faint reflections. My father sat at the head, his voice smooth but distant, questions precise and polite. My mother smiled without blinking, her fingers twisting a napkin into a tight, tense knot. Tatiana kept the conversation alive with her rehearsed stories, and the twins’ giggles spilled over like their milk. And I would sit discreetly pushing green beans around my plate, offering polite, practiced answers. Smiling just enough. Speaking just softly enough. Never making a mess.

But everything had to be impeccable. If a fork was out of place, my mother’s gaze would tighten. When a drop of milk spilled, her voice would sharpen, thoughtful but tense. “Careful, please.” It wasn’t anger - it was something colder. A need for flawless surfaces, for smiles that never cracked.

The house watched, its polished mirrors catching every movement, its walls absorbing every hushed word.

My mother’s sunroom was her own composed dream - a place where light washed over neatly folded silks, lace veils floating like soft-spoken secrets over faceless mannequins. Her sewing machine sat beneath the window, its soft hum a lullaby she never sang. She was always there, her fingers dancing across the fabric, pinning, threading, cutting. Silk and tulle stood in faultless rows, veils hung without a single crease. She stitched beauty for other women - supreme, sophisticated dreams she never claimed.

To the left of the foyer, my father’s study was where the house’s illusion fractured. Shelves lined the walls, crowded with thick architecture texts - some stacked neatly, others leaning, their spines softened with use. Blueprints lay scattered across the drafting table, corners curling, a ruler balanced across a half-finished sketch. His desk was dark, polished walnut but never clear - sharp pencils spilling from a silver cup, a glass tumbler with faint amber stains, and his leather-bound sketchbooks stacked without order. It was a world of order, of lines and pristine angles. Even the silence was measured.

His compulsion for control stretched through the whole house - pictures hung in unwavering symmetry, the crystal chandelier always sparkling, the front garden a sea of pink roses, each bloom opened just right. Even when I tracked in sand from the pier, my mother’s eyes would catch it, her lips pressing thin. “Lana, please - wipe your feet.”

And then there was Biscuit - a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with chestnut and white fur brushed to a cloudlike sheen, her dark eyes wide and watchful. My mother adored her - a perfect accessory to a perfect house. But she wasn’t just a pretty distraction. Biscuit’s dark eyes followed me from room to room, her soft fur always pressing against me. I’d bury my face in her coat, whispering things I didn’t dare say out loud, and she’d lean closer, her warmth a comfort that never left.

In my room, the walls pressed in like a pastel fog  - my mother’s idea, of course. A four-poster bed dressed in sheer, gauzy curtains that caught the light like mist. The bedspread was a lush garden of pale roses against cream, each petal fragile, perfectly arranged, the kind of beauty that never left a trace of who I was. The vanity sparkled with elegant glass perfume bottles I never used, their sugary scents nauseating. A lace-trimmed mirror reflected the room’s purity - soft, floral, untouched.

But the pink never felt like mine. It was a color meant for someone softer, sweeter - someone who fit into the careful mold my mother shaped. I was supposed to be that girl - the one who smiled on cue, her voice always soft, her eyes never wandering too far. An ethereal mask that never cracked.

Despite the soft pale walls and the lace curtains, I found ways to carve out a space that felt like mine. The muted floral bedspread was soon buried beneath a tangle of thrifted throw blankets, rich, deep colors that swallowed the flimsy roses. Band posters crept up the walls, peeling at the corners, their bold, chaotic images clashing against the washed-out calm.

The bookshelf was an unassuming rebellion - classics and poetry my mother approved of in neat, even rows, but behind them, obscured from view, were dog-eared romance novels and a few forbidden records I wasn’t supposed to own. The vanity, meant to sparkle with glass perfume bottles, hid more than perfume. Beneath the delicate floral scents, I kept a tiny silver lighter and a stolen silver ring - tarnished, twisted slightly out of shape, a secret I never wore.

The vanity - once an intricate display of glass perfume bottles - became a mess of contradictions. Beneath the floral scents, I kept a green lighter, a stolen golden ring twisted slightly out of shape, and a crumpled concert flyer from a band my mother would have hated. Paint-stained brushes sometimes found their way there, too, leaning against the polished glass.

And beneath the bed, a battered shoebox - filled with ticket stubs, a chipped silver compact with a fogged mirror, tangled necklaces, and a dried rose I’d stolen from a wedding bouquet in my mother’s sunroom. A covert shrine to all the pieces of me that didn’t fit the perfect pink frame.

Sometimes, late at night, I’d lean out over the wrought-iron balcony, a joint smoldering between my fingers, the smoke curling up into the humid dark. Those were the only moments I felt real - watching the roses bloom too perfectly below, their petals too precise, the whole garden a careful lie. My mother fussed over those flowers like they were proof of something - like she could prune her way to happiness, arrange beauty until it made sense.

The summer I was seventeen, I did escape - at least for a while. I slipped out just past midnight, the thick air swallowing me whole, the dark pressing close like a confession. I met my friends at the private pier. 

We passed a bottle between us, laughter slipping into the dark, the tranquil rush of water beneath our feet. For a little while, I wasn’t anyone’s daughter. I wasn’t careful, or discreet, or perfect. I was just there - drifting beneath the stars.

The walk home was the best part - warm air sticking to my skin, a blur of giggles still curling in my chest, the world swaying just enough to feel endless. But the second I hit the driveway, it was like stepping off a cliff - joy draining to dread, the house staring back, heavy and unforgiving, waiting to swallow me whole.

At 3:30 a.m., I was caught. I’d made it all the way back, my feet aching, my hair a mess, the night’s heat still clinging to my skin. I thought I’d made it. The key slipped into the lock, almost there - then the porch light exploded on.

“Lana.”

Fuck. Her voice cut through the dark, restrained and venomous, a trap snapping shut.

“Do you ever think about anyone but yourself?” Her shoulders sagged, one hand pressed against the doorframe. “Or is it all just a game to you?” 

I mumbled something about being with friends, the words thin and meaningless. Her stare never wavered. “Your father’s asleep. Go to bed. We’ll talk in the morning.”

But we didn’t. Not really. Morning drifted in peacefully, the house bathed in soft light, the same old routine playing out. But her scrutiny found me and lingered, a slow, methodical weight. She didn’t have to say anything - her silence was enough.

Sometimes, I’d scratch my name into the soft, painted wood of the windowsill - tiny, jagged letters hidden beneath the curtain’s edge. A reminder that I was here, even when no one saw me.

Because the house saw me. It saw the restless ache beneath my careful smiles. It saw the way I slipped out onto the balcony at night, letting the smoke curl into the darkness. It saw the hunger that twisted beneath the surface, the seething rage I swallowed down with each carefully measured answer.

We moved there to escape something, to build something new. But the house was just a picture hung over a crack in the wall - an untarnished image to obscure the damage.

A place where silence was survival, where smiles were painted on like lipstick, where I learned to disappear without ever leaving. But sometimes, I needed proof I existed. So I scratched my name into the window ledge - tiny, jagged letters buried beneath the curtain’s edge. A mark no one would see.

A scar I left behind because it was safer than leaving one on myself.

I’ve mentioned I’m anxious in the title because I would really like to find connections who understand what it’s like to live with an anxiety disorder.

Ours is a townhouse with a front patio and gate followed by 5-6 steps that take to the sidewalk. 

Apparently I just returned back from work yesterday to uncover a bus stop installed right in front of my main gate (It's just a pole with a board with stop numbers and what busses stop here)  There was no notification from city whatsoever. This bus stop has always been 50 ft away.  Here are my concerns - 

Safety - I cannot let me kids freely play on my front patio anymore knowing someone standing right in front of the house always.  

Littering - I'm already seeing coffee Mugs, to go boxes, literally laying on the stairs opposite my house. 

Notification - Shouldn't the city courtesy notify the resident opposite to which the Bus Stop is apparently moving? 

My front patio camera keeps on detecting people and alarming me, causing me lot of irritation now. 

What are my options?

[Domestic violence/murder].","I think it’s safe to say most of us have gotten that same old lecture from our parents at some point or another.
Don’t marry young. Keep it in your pants. Don’t get pregnant.
You know the spiel.

Well… turns out, the smartest thing we can do is actually listen. Because they were right.

But before we get to that, let’s rewind a bit.
Here’s a good spot: I was 18 years old and convinced I had an entire world of nothing but never-ending beauty and wonder ahead of me. Lol, how terribly fucking mistaken I was.

Sure, I was beautiful. Talented, even. But intelligence? Yeah… Sadly, not a quality I possessed. And neither was good taste in men.

Anthony and I met senior year—about six months before graduation. We’d both already picked out colleges and gotten accepted. But in those short seven months, we fell head over heels in love. It was a whirlwind, and neither of us could imagine being apart.

Did I mention I wasn’t smart? Just want to make sure that part sticks.

Because instead of chasing my own dreams, I kissed them goodbye. Gave up the college I was desperate to attend, packed up my life, and moved four states away to be with him. He, of course, got to chase his dreams. Go figure.

About a year and a half after settling into our new home, he proposed. I was elated. Said yes without a second thought.

At first, things were great. But it didn’t take long before the cracks started showing.

He grew controlling. Told me to quit my part-time barista job—one I actually loved. Said he didn’t like the thought of me “serving coffee to old perverts all day.”

Then it was my makeup. Said he didn’t want other men looking at me. Told me to “be more conservative.”
Eventually, I was dressing in baggy jeans and his oversized T-shirts, hiding my figure completely.

He even installed some app on my phone to monitor what I was doing.

One night, I’d finally had enough. I told him it was over, stormed out of the house, and got into my car—only to find that it wouldn’t start. No matter how many times I turned the key, it just sputtered.

I was livid. I climbed back out and stormed up to the front door—only to see him sitting at the kitchen table, laughing.

He never admitted what he did to my car, but whatever it was, it ended up totaled.

Things escalated after that. The day he put his hands on me for the first time, something inside me snapped.
I might have been naïve—but I wasn’t about to be that woman. The one who sticks around and lets a man treat her like a punching bag.

I packed what little I had left—he’d already destroyed most of my stuff—and walked out.

But if you’re hoping that’s where it ended, I hate to disappoint you.
Anthony wasn’t the type to just let go. Especially not of me.

It was around 2 AM. Dark as hell outside. I had three duffel bags slung over my shoulders and was wearing flip-flops and pajama shorts.

Out of nowhere, he came sprinting up behind me, tackled me to the ground, and pressed a knife to my throat.

You know that cliché in horror stories—“it made my blood run cold”?
Yeah. I always thought that was dramatic too. Until that moment.

My entire body locked up. I couldn’t scream. Couldn’t move.
That look in his eyes… I knew if I made a sound, he wouldn’t hesitate to kill me.

With one hand still holding the knife and the other wrapped in my hair, he yanked me to my feet and hissed, “Stay quiet and I won’t hurt you.”

He started walking me back toward the house. I was shaking so hard my teeth were clacking.

And then, as if he wasn’t already terrifying enough, he leaned close and snarled:
“What’s the matter, bitch? Cold? Maybe if you wore some decent clothes for once, you nasty whore.”

The words didn’t break me. I was used to that kind of verbal garbage.
What broke me was realizing how real this had become. How dangerous he truly was.

We were about thirty feet from the driveway when a pair of headlights cut through the dark.

Anthony tensed. He shoved the knife in his pocket and yanked me closer.
“Act fucking natural or you die.”

Here’s a fun fact: no matter how casual you try to look, when you’ve got three duffel bags slung over your shoulder and a deranged man leading you by the hair, people are gonna notice.

A truck turned the corner and slowed beside us.

Anthony started to panic. “What the fuck, what the fuck,” he whispered. “Don’t say a word. Let me handle this.”

The truck stopped, headlights dimmed. A burly, gray-haired man rolled down his window.

“Everything all right, miss?” he asked, completely ignoring Anthony.

Anthony jumped in. “She’s fine. Ain’t shit to see here, old man. Get lost.”

The man glared at him. “You’re only as old as you feel, motherfucker. And I’m feeling pretty lucky tonight.”
Then his tone softened as he looked back at me.
“Now… like I was saying… you all right, ma’am?”

Before I could answer, Anthony lost it.

He pulled the knife and charged the truck, pointing it at the driver.
“I’ll fucking kill you, you son of a bitch! You don’t know who the fuck you’re messing with!”

The man didn’t even flinch. “Let’s not get our panties in a twist.”
He rolled the window up almost all the way. “Put that thing down before you hurt yourself, son.”

Anthony didn’t notice the guy reaching into his glove box. But I did.

Anthony started pounding on the window, ranting.
“Get out of the goddamn truck, pussy! Come on, motherfucker!”

The man calmly unbuckled his seatbelt and shifted into the passenger seat. For a second, I thought maybe he was scared.

He wasn’t.

POP.

The sound exploded in my ears. Glass shattered.

And Anthony dropped. Just like that. A bloody heap on the sidewalk.

I stumbled back, falling over my bags and scraping my elbows on the pavement. My heart felt like it was about to punch through my ribs.

“What the fuck?” I whispered, my voice cracking. “What the fuck?”

The passenger door opened, and the man stepped out. He was huge—at least 6’4”, solid muscle, gray ponytail, and a beard straight out of Duck Dynasty.

He kept a safe distance and extended a hand. “You need help up, miss?”

That was it? That’s all he had to say?

I couldn’t even answer. I was frozen. My lips parted, but no sound came out.

He studied me closely. “He hurt you, didn’t he?”

He paused, searching for the right words. “I promise… I’m not gonna hurt you. And he damn sure ain’t gonna hurt nobody no more.”

In that moment, all I could think about was my parents. So long ago, Anthony had forced me to cut them off. I just wanted my mom. My daddy. I was only twenty. Still a kid. And I was facing things no twenty-year-old girl should ever have to face.

I lost it. My steely exterior crumbled, and in an instant, I was a mess of snot and tears.

The man stepped back slightly and dropped his hand, clearly unsure. I must’ve looked horrifying—eyes wide with shock, mascara streaming like black paint—but after a moment, he stepped closer. He knelt down there in the grass and gently placed a hand on my shoulder.

“Come on, miss. Let me take you somewhere and get you cleaned up.” His eyes flicked toward Anthony’s body. The blood had already pooled beneath him. “Besides… I know we’re out in the sticks, but we probably need to get the hell out of Dodge.”

Suddenly, it all felt real. Anthony wasn’t just dead. He’d been murdered. I couldn’t report it. This man had saved me. What else could I do? I let him help me up.

“ one sec,” he said, before walking around to the passengers side and sweeping all the glass shards out onto the road. When he was finished, he grabbed a towel from the backseat and laid it down.

Smoothing out the towel, he turned to me. “ here you go, miss.”

I walked around the truck and climbed in, still shivering.

He settled into the driver‘s seat, then reached into the backseat once more. “ you look like you need this,” he said, handing me a folded throw blanket.

“ thank you,” I said quietly, taking it from him and unfolding it.

He blasted the heat and the engine roar to life. We drove east about thirty minutes, into the next town, and stopped at a quiet little motel. He put the truck in park, turned off the engine, and looked over at me.

“I’m guessing you don’t have any money. I’m sure he took all that.”

I nodded, sniffling.

Without another word, he stepped out of the truck and disappeared inside the building. I waited ten minutes before he came back, holding a key card. He handed it to me.

“Room forty-seven. Get yourself a shower and a good night’s sleep,” he said with a gentle smile.

My mind was spinning. Who was this guy? Why was he doing this for me?

I had to ask.

He sighed and leaned back in his seat, thinking. “I’m nobody special, miss. Just a man in the right place at the right time.” He chuckled softly. “Well… depending on how you look at it. Some might say the wrong place.”

I managed a weak smile. “Thanks,” I said, taking the key card.

“Don’t mention it.”

I climbed out and shut the door behind me. The headlights lit my path across the parking lot. I turned back for one last look. He threw a hand out the window in a final, friendly wave—then drove off into the night.

I never saw that man again. Never found out his name.

The next morning, I turned on the six o’clock news.

“Man found shot to death in Runner Ridge. Wife still missing.”

Panic surged through me. What if they thought I did it? I’d been so desperate to escape that I hadn’t stopped to think. They might actually blame me.

I paced the motel room, heart racing, trying to figure out what to do. Finally, I decided.

With shaking hands, I dug my phone from one of the duffel bags and dialed 911.

Operator: 911, what’s your emergency?

Me (crying hysterically): I’m at a motel in Carver. I came here to get away from my husband. He was beating me—I just needed to get out for the night, you know? But I turned on the news, and it said he’s been shot! Please tell me it’s not true—please, God!

Operator: Ma’am, I can barely understand you. Breathe. Who’s been shot?

I sucked in a shaky breath, trying to sound like I was holding it together.

Me: My husband! We had a huge fight last night. He got violent and I left, but now the news says he’s dead!

Operator: What’s his name?

Me: Anthony Baldwin. Please, please tell me it’s not real.

Operator: …Mrs. Baldwin, I think you need to come down to the station.

Panic flared again, but I kept my voice as calm as I could.

Me: I don’t have a ride. He destroyed my car.

Operator: How did you get to the motel, forty miles away?

Shit.

Me: My mother gave me a ride.

Mental note: call Mom. Fast.

Operator: All right. What’s your exact location? We’ll send a cruiser.

I gave her the motel address and hung up, still crying like my heart was broken. Forty-five minutes later, a sheriff knocked on the door. I rode with him to the station, answered all the questions, still sobbing. I told him about the fight—how Anthony had grabbed me, how I’d run, how he chased me with a knife. I said I called my mom, and she pulled up just in time. He’d threatened us both, but we left him standing on the roadside. After that, I had no idea what happened.

With all the bruises and bald patches on my scalp, it wasn’t hard to sell. He took notes the whole time, nodding occasionally.

When I finished, he scratched his head and gave me a long look.

“Ma’am… what you’ve been through is awful. I’m sorry.”

I gave him a faint smile and nodded.

“We’re not ruling anything out,” he said carefully. “But I will say this—an older man called in the shooting. Said he was a neighbor. Said he was getting ready for work around five this morning when he heard a gunshot. Looked out the window and saw a red Buick tearing off down the road. Said Anthony was lying there in a pool of blood. Reckon it shook him up pretty bad, but he wanted to make sure you was alright, so he drove down to your place… but you was already gone. If that’s the case, that puts you 40 miles away when the shooting took place.”

He paused, chewing the cap of his pen.

“He called anonymously. Never gave his name. Said he didn’t want to get drawn into it. I guess that makes sense. But the thing is… We’ve questioned all your neighbors, Mrs. Baldwin. Ain’t a one of them that old man.”

Then he looked me dead in the eye. “Ma’am… I don’t think you killed your husband. But I think you know who did.”

I froze, picturing the gray-haired man who’d risked everything to save me. I met the sheriff’s gaze and straightened my back, lifting my chin.

“Sir… I was forty miles away in a motel room. Because my husband had just beat the hell out of me. I don’t know who killed him.”

I shot him a glare from across the table, motioning towards my bruised up arms.” whoever did it, did me a fucking solid. Now, if you don’t mind, sir… I’d really like to put this shit behind me.”

He nodded slowly and sighed. “Very well, then,” he said, snapping his notebook shut. “We’ll be in touch.”

That was almost twenty years ago. Nothing ever came of it. The case went cold fast. The anonymous caller was never identified.

But I know who he was.

I have long sense moved on with my life. A few years later, I met a good man. I can’t stress how good it feels to wake up every day beside a man who loves me for me. 

I finally got to chase my own dreams. I’ve gotten an amazing career and three lovely children. I managed to mend my relationship with my parents. Daddy passed away a few years back, but Mama is still kicking and in good spirits. Can’t say I expected much less. She’s always been a fighter.

 My life has been sprinkled with ups and downs, but all in all, I’ve been blessed. And I owe it all to A quiet old man in a pick up truck who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Well… Depending on who you ask. If you asked me, I’d say it was just the opposite.",22,1747369153.0,stories,2,0.97,False
