I trusted a “4.8-star” cafe on a big review site, only to end up with watery espresso and a sad vibe. Turns out, half the reviews were fake or from folks who think instant coffee is gourmet. That’s why I built [near-me.cafe](http://near-me.cafe) to connect serious coffee lovers with cafes that get it, using authenticated reviews you can actually trust.

I don’t see why I would waste electricity to keep things cooled to use it weeks or months later. And I usually drink coffee or tapwater 🤷‍♂️. 

I admit it looks sad af 😂 But to me some of these posts look like people are always prepared to have an unexpected 50-man party or sth. I simply don’t understand why you would keep 100+ cans of soda cooled at all times. ",1,1753452599.0,FridgeDetective,0,1.0,False

Gaining knowledge and progress on how to make better coffee is great. I make it every day at work (and on vacation too!), and everyone remarks on my AeroPress and wants me to teach them how to use it. It's the best gift I've ever given myself. I've been following this subreddit since the beginning of my journey, but this is the first time I wanted to say hello. I also would like to get some advice on buying a flow control attachment. Will it work well with the AeroPress GO (I've seen mixed reviews)? Is the one from AliExpress similar? I don't have a lot of money and I'm wondering if saving this much is worth it.

1m905dz,https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1m905dz/animating_background_characters/,Animating background characters,"Hi guys, 

What would you consider the best way to have 2 or more characters moving through the background, they would have a number of animations that would be called upon at random whenever the current one ends like idle, move around, make a cup of coffee etc.

My problem is that some of these animations would be seperate and some would include both characters interacting with each other, so I would need them to be perfectly synched.

I also need to make them clickable for player interaction, but that would only spawn like a speech-bubble or sound effect not change the animations.

Currently i am storing everything in a dictionary like this:

    ...
    {""Boxii"":{""animation"":""idle"",""start_pos"":[600,290]}, ""Cuby"":{""animation"":""idle""}},
                {""Boxii"":{""animation"":""jump"",""movement"":[[-10,-40,1.2],[-20,10,0.6]]}, ""Cuby"":{""animation"":""rainbow""}, ""repeat"":9},
    ...

and this is my code:

    extends Node
    
    signal step_finished(character_name)

Its not really working, they keep getting out of synch and moving weirdly, probably cause they run multiple animations at once or something idk...

1m903yl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m903yl/when_have_you_gotten_away_with_a_crime/,When have you gotten away with a crime?,"The streetlights outside my window cast long, skeletal shadows across the living room floor. It was late, past midnight, and the silence was usually a comfort. Tonight, it felt like a drum, amplifying the frantic knocking that had just started at my back door. *Knock, knock, knock-knock-knock.* Aggressive. Impatient.

I froze. Who on earth would be at my door at this hour, especially the back door? My heart hammered against my ribs. This wasn't the kind of neighborhood where you got surprise visits after dark. A cold dread seeped into my bones.

The knocking intensified, followed by a muffled shout. ""Hey! I know you're in there! Open up!""

It was that new guy from down the street, the one with the loud car and the perpetually scowling face. He'd moved in a few weeks ago and had already caused a ruckus with the neighbors over his barking dog and late-night parties. I'd tried to avoid him, but he seemed to have a knack for finding trouble. Or, in this case, bringing it to my doorstep.

""I saw your lights! Open the damn door, I need a word with you!"" His voice was slurred, thick with what sounded like alcohol. Great. A drunk, angry neighbor at my back door. My hand instinctively went to the heavy iron poker by the fireplace. Just in case.

""Look, I don't want any trouble,"" I called out, trying to keep my voice steady. ""You should go home. It's late.""

He laughed, a harsh, grating sound. ""Trouble? You're the one who's going to have trouble if you don't open up right now! I know what you did!""

My blood ran cold. *What I did?* This was escalating quickly. He started rattling the doorknob, hard. The old wood groaned. Was he trying to break in? My mind raced. This wasn't just a drunk neighbor; this felt like a threat. A genuine, terrifying threat. My grip on the poker tightened.

The rattling stopped abruptly. There was a moment of silence, and then a loud *CRACK* as something hit the door. He was trying to smash it in. Panic seized me. I couldn't let him in. Not him. Not like this.

I braced myself, waiting for the next blow, but it didn't come. Instead, there was a sudden, sharp *thud* from the other side, followed by a choked gasp. Then, silence. Utter, complete silence.

I waited, poker still raised, for what felt like an eternity. Nothing. No more shouts, no more rattling, no more thuds. Just the distant hum of the city. Slowly, cautiously, I lowered the poker and crept towards the door, peering through the peephole.

He was there, lying on the ground, still. A dark, spreading stain bloomed on the concrete beside his head. He must have slipped, or maybe tripped over something in the dark, and hit his head hard. What a clumsy fool. It was an accident. A tragic, unfortunate accident.

I sighed, the tension slowly draining from my body, replaced by a strange, almost clinical calm. It was a mess, certainly. A problem to be dealt with. But at least the immediate threat was gone.

The first step was to ensure no one saw. The back alley was usually deserted at this hour. I dragged him inside, the surprising lightness of his frame a minor convenience. The floorboards creaked under his weight, but the house was old, and the sounds were familiar to me. I worked quickly, efficiently, cleaning the concrete outside with a bucket of water and a stiff brush until no trace remained. Inside, the process was more involved.

I laid him out on the tarp in the basement, the fluorescent light casting a stark, unflattering glow on his pale skin. His face, even in death, held that same scowl. Such a waste of good potential. I ran my gloved hand along his jawline, feeling the firm structure beneath. Yes, this would do nicely.

The initial incision was clean, precise, following the natural lines of the body. The blade, honed to a razor's edge, slid through skin and muscle with satisfying ease. The rich, coppery scent filled the air, a familiar perfume that always sharpened my focus. First, the major arteries, carefully drained to prevent excessive bruising. I worked with a surgeon's meticulousness, separating muscle groups, admiring the intricate architecture of the human form. The deep red of the muscle fibers, the pearly sheen of the tendons, the glistening white of the bone – each component was a testament to nature's design.

I started with the thighs, the thick, lean meat always a favorite. Slicing away the quadriceps and hamstrings, I trimmed them meticulously, removing any fascia or excess fat. The texture was perfect, firm yet yielding. Next, the glutes, large and substantial, perfect for a slow roast. I moved to the torso, carefully excising the tenderloin and sirloin equivalents, the prime cuts. The ribs, too, would be excellent, stripped clean and slow-cooked until the meat fell off the bone.

The organs were always a special treat. The liver, rich and iron-filled, would be pan-seared with a touch of garlic and herbs. The heart, resilient and strong, could be thinly sliced for a carpaccio or diced into a stew. Even the brain, a delicate, almost custardy texture, had its own unique appeal, best served lightly scrambled. I carefully separated the head, the skull surprisingly robust, but easily managed with the right tools. The eyes, still wide and staring, were removed and set aside; some things are best discarded.

Hours passed, marked only by the rhythmic scrape of the blade and the soft thud of muscle hitting the prepared containers. By the time the first hint of dawn touched the sky, the basement was pristine, and the freezer was well-stocked. I wiped down my tools, each one gleaming, and carefully put them away.

I brewed a fresh pot of coffee, the aroma mingling pleasantly with the lingering, faint scent of my night's work. The morning news would likely report a missing person, perhaps a ""clumsy drunk"" who wandered off. They'd never suspect the quiet neighbor, the one who just wanted to be left alone.

I took a sip of coffee, a contented sigh escaping my lips. The world was full of rude, aggressive people who just didn't know how to mind their own business. And sometimes, those people just happened to stumble into the wrong backyard. It was a shame, really. But a man had to eat. And some ingredients were just too good to pass up.",1,1753452426.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

For taste reference, I primarily drink McDonald’s double double, for Keurig pods I used light or medium roast. I HATE strong coffee and don’t really drink latte’s, espresso, or anything fancy.

Is there a brand of pods you can recommend for me that will give me the classic “double double” taste? Or should I just buy another Keurig? Are all Nespresso coffee pods strong and “bitter” tasting?

Im trying to bounce back both mentally and physically, but feel wrecked. (Mentally wrecked, really.) Im off my routine,  so that is certainly contributing to it, as well as the hormonal changes.   
What should I adjust, once Im back in action again?


30mg vyvanse daily
.7ml IM testosterone 
10g methalyne blue (just increased from 5 to 10 today)
Creatine 
Pre-workout (beta-alanine, L-citraline, lions mane, Alpha GPC)
Protein shake
(10mg latuda- mood stabilizer)

Neutropic cordyceps coffee in the AM


My diet right now is TRASH.  But when im behaving, its actually quite good at 3k cal daily with a reasonable macro split.

A week looks like

Working in a manufacturing warehouse mon-fri 8hrs.

Monday/Wednesday/Friday/Saturday- strength training at the gym

Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday- 2h roller derby practice (cardio, skills, conditioning)



Ive been on my ass for about 6 weeks now and going nuts.   I know itll be over soon, but I want to get my routine and supplements adjusted appropriately for when life returns to normal. My mental health has taken an absolute dive from inability to work out.

Id really like to be able to focus more.  I have raging ADHD and tend to get ""stuck"" and not able to do or remember anything.  Thoughts won't stay in my head and I struggle to complete tasks.    I also just simply feel stupid sometimes.  I don't know.    My doctors dont know what to do with me half the time because ""research isnt there"" etc, for ftm individuals.   So id really rather just do this myself. 

 Any help is really,  appreciated.  ",1,1753452226.0,Biohackers,1,1.0,False

1m8zyfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeetNewPeopleHere/comments/1m8zyfg/42m_france_i_am_an_english_guy_living_in_france_i/,42M France I am an English guy living in France. I am seeking to start off as friends first with a nice lady that may develop into something serious later on. This post tells you more about what I am seeking I know what I want in life and I have been very open and honest about myself long post!,"Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is ages between 25 and 32 and please have maturity and decency many thanks. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!",2,1753452059.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

1m8zwwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/1m8zwwn/veteran_division_gatekeeping/,Veteran Division & Gate-Keeping,"I keep seeing us tear one another down over who “deserves” what the VA gives out, and it eats at me. Most of us walked into a recruiting office because it was the only clear path we saw to a doctor and a classroom. They took us young, trained us hard, and sent us home with skills that don’t line up against civilian job descriptions. Whether the paperwork says zero percent or a hundred, every one of us paid something we can’t get back. Every one of us are owed far more than the system will ever willingly give back. 

The real sting is that while we argue over the scraps, the people who wrote the original contract never feel the pinch. All they have to do is watch us argue about who’s faking, who’s lazy, who “just needs to work harder,” and they can quietly cut another slice out of the budget. Twenty-two veterans still choose suicide every day. That number should be enough to make us put the finger-pointing down. 

I’m not asking anyone to storm the Capitol. I just want us to stop doing their work for them. If a vet asks where the food bank is, point him there without a lecture. If someone’s claim gets approved and yours didn’t, remember the fight is with the system, not the guy who finally caught a break. Pick a veterans’ group—VFW, American Legion, IAVA, Team RWB, AMVETS, whatever—and show up. If none of them feel right, start your own. Bring two buddies with you next time, even if it’s just for coffee and paperwork help. When you see the “they’re faking it” comment, hit back with “Mission still stands, we take care of our own. DM me and I’ll walk you through the paperwork if you need it.” Post the suicide line like it’s a rally point: 988, then press 1.

1m8zwih,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1m8zwih/the_return_of_the_bully/,The return of the bully,"I just woke up from a nightmare that I even feel in my heart. I got bullied by this person about 18 years ago. Imagine! 

In this dream I was on some kind of trip with him and some other man. I had to sleep with them in one bed. But it turned into buillying via a videocall. Where they were making quite a catchy song about everything they thought was wrong with me. The more I tried to make it stop, the harder they were continuing to sing it. It turned into a musical. I decided to sleep on the couch after I told him I don't think I can trust him anymore. 

Somehow I left it up to my mom to deal with him. But instead of doing anything about it, she turned the song louder.  Untill I put it softer to try and catch some sleep.

Woke up with my heart still aching and that song still in my head haha. What a way to start the day. I got quite painfully excluded by that bully from my dreams a long time ago. Feeling like that fragile teenager again. Time to drink a big ass mug of coffee to try and flush it away in my head. ",2,1753451936.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

This isn't a problem for most people because we tap the card on the reader and wait to see that it goes through or at least hear the usual thank you from the brave soul manning the register. But then there's the people who just up and walk away. 


They'll grab a single beer or coffee or what have you, tap the machine once and just leave as quickly as they can without waiting for any confirmation of having paid. Most machines here will beep once when the card is recognised and once more when the transaction goes through, these people either don't know this or just don't care as they won't wait for even the first one. 


In the last 2 months I've had to run after a couple of customers because the machine is asking for a pin number from someone who is already outside and unlocking their car. Granted most of the time people around here are nice enough and just come back to do it but some huff, puff and grumble at me and or the machine.


I wonder if this is an issue for others?",1,1753451913.0,retailhell,2,1.0,False

1m8zu1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/HauntedRouter/comments/1m8zu1c/how_well_do_you_know_your_children_part_1/,How Well Do You Know Your Children part 1,"For extra context read “I’m A Terrible Serial Killer”

People pretend to understand their children’s lives, but in truth, they’re often lying to themselves or their friends to save face. You wouldn’t believe how many crying mothers come to me, desperate to find their kids, only to discover them in some drug den, squandering their “college money.” That’s other people’s kids, right? Never your precious angel. But that’s the lie we tell ourselves. 
Despite our best efforts, our children are their own people, free to use their will as they choose. 

I did everything right in my parents’ eyes, especially my father’s. I graduated high school, went straight to the police academy, and climbed the ranks in my midsized city. I became the youngest chief homicide detective, partly because the previous chief succumbed to a brutal heroin addiction. 

It wasn’t long before I met Jessica, the love of my life, the most beautiful brunette God ever created. That is, until our daughter, Becca, was born—she became my entire world. Watching her grow, exploring the wonders around her, was what I looked forward to every day. Everything changed when Becca turned fourteen. 

It wasn’t teenage angst; it was Jessica’s stage-four ovarian cancer diagnosis. We were the perfect family until then—family dinners, summer vacations, never missing Becca’s extracurriculars. After the diagnosis, we grew stronger for a time, but watching the brightest light in your life fade to nothing would break even the strongest man. Seeing my frail wife take her last breath changed my fourteen-year-old daughter. 

Becca dropped all her activities and threw herself into her studies. As a father, I was proud of my honor student, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t miss her talking to me. Her high school years passed like this, but I stayed positive at home. I never wanted her to carry the weight of her broken father. 

That is until I was alone in the big, empty room where I once held my beautiful wife, the darkness sank in. It’s hard to describe the horror of that solitude. I’d sit in the middle of my bed, the walls racing in opposite directions, my skin shivering as a black hole opened in my chest, pulling in the misery the walls fled from. I didn’t cry or moan—just trembled, wishing tears would release me from that cosmic pressure. 

You might think opening up to Becca or seeking family counseling would’ve helped. I tried. For two years after Jessica’s death, we saw grief counselors, psychiatrists, you name it. It stopped the day Becca came home from school, tears in her eyes, and said, “Please, no more shrinks, Dad. They can’t bring Mom back.” Her words confused me—no one was trying to resurrect Jessica. I said, “They’re just helping you process, sweetheart.” She looked at her fidgeting hands and whispered, “I know. I just want it to stop.” That day, I saw a pain in her deeper than at her mother’s funeral. I canceled all future sessions. 

When I dropped her off at college in the next state, I told her how proud I was. She hugged me tightly and said something that seared into me: “You don’t have to pretend to be strong anymore.” It was four years before she contacted me again. 

I lasted six months before I started drinking. Even though Becca rarely spoke when she was home, she gave me purpose, a reason to hold it together. But her words haunted me like a broken record: “You don’t have to pretend to be strong anymore.” I kept my job for another six months before taking early retirement at fifty. I wasn’t ready to stop working, but my drinking had taken over, affecting my ability to lead. I’d sneak drinks at work, chuckling to myself, “At least it’s not heroin—this job must be cursed.” I didn’t want to end up a disgrace like my predecessor, so retirement was the logical choice. 

I sold my home, downsized to a smaller place, hoping the walls wouldn’t race away. They did, and the void in my chest remained. With my remaining money, I bought a small office and became a private investigator, figuring I was the only boss who wouldn’t fire me for drinking. 

The next three years blurred with cases of infidelity, wayward kids, and odd jobs—until Becca called. At three a.m., I woke groggy, still buzzed, but her voice sobered me instantly. “Daddy, please come get me,” she said, followed by unintelligible garble. I always knew her location through Find My iPhone—not to stalk her, but because I never stopped paying her bills to support her through college. 

Her annual transcripts, sent without words, were her way of saying she was okay and thanking me. I didn’t need her calls, just confirmation she was safe. 

That night, she was ready. I drove like a man possessed to an oversized frat party. There, I found a brown-haired, blue-eyed girl slumped against a red sports car. It was Becca, just sleeping. I carried her to my car. 

The next morning, she woke to the smell of pancakes and me in the kitchen. Despite her hangover, her face lit up, and she rushed me with a bear hug, apologizing for not calling, saying she loved me over and over. Apparently, a sorority girl bragging about a Lake Tahoe trip with her father had triggered her, leading to drunken tears and her call to me. 

That sorority girl was the best thing to happen to me in years—she gave me my daughter back. Becca was now the happy, strong woman her mother had been before the cancer. Over the next few days, she shared her life: her law major, her love for yoga, and why she’d stayed silent. 

She thought contacting me would drag me back into her pain, believing she was an anchor holding me down. She now knew that was never true. 

We started talking weekly. One day, she called about a guy she met at a coffee shop near her yoga class. They talked daily, but he hadn’t asked her out. She laughed, saying she’d give him one more chance tomorrow and promised to keep me posted. She never did. It’s been two years, and Becca still hasn’t been found. I’ll never stop looking for the man who took her.",1,1753451763.0,HauntedRouter,0,1.0,False

Feeling overwhelmed? Staring at a giant task list? Spent hours organizing your work instead of doing it? You're not alone.

Here's a stupid simple trick that actually works: Eat That Frog.

No, not a real frog! 🐸 It means: Do your HARDEST or MOST IMPORTANT task FIRST thing in your workday. Before email. Before meetings. Before easy little tasks.

Why ""Eat That Frog"" works magic for coders and builders:

Your Brain is Freshest Early: Willpower and focus are like a full battery in the morning. Use that power on the tough stuff (debugging that complex bug, building the core feature, writing that scary email). Hard things get easier.

Stop Procrastinating Pain: That scary task hanging over you? It drains your energy all day just thinking about it. Do it FIRST and feel FREE. The rest of the day feels easier.

Momentum Builder: Knocking out the big, hard thing first gives you a HUGE win. Feeling like a superhero? Now tackle the smaller stuff!

Avoid ""Planning Trap"": It's easy to spend hours rearranging Jira tickets, making beautiful todo lists, or ""researching""... instead of actually coding or building. Planning isn't progress. Doing is.

Small Wins Trick Your Brain: Finishing your ""frog"" gives a dopamine hit (feel-good chemical). You crave MORE wins, making it easier to keep going.

How to Actually Do It (Super Simple):

Tonight/Tomorrow Morning: Look at your list. Ask: ""What's the ONE thing I'm dreading or that really matters?"" That's your frog.

Protect Your Morning: Block 60-90 minutes FIRST THING. No distractions. Close Slack, email, Twitter. Put phone away.

JUST START: Seriously. Open your code editor, draft that email, sketch that design. Action kills anxiety. Don't overthink step 1.

Celebrate the Frog! Finished it? Even partly? HUGE WIN. Do a little dance, get coffee, feel awesome. Then move to smaller tasks.

""But what if my frog is HUGE?""

Chop it! Can't build the whole feature? Fix one specific bug within it. Write one function. Draft one section. Make the frog bite-sized.

""But I'm not a morning person?""

Use your best time. ""First thing"" means your first focused work block, whenever that is. Protect that time fiercely!

Stop letting the scary task control your day. Eat the frog first. Watch your productivity (and mood) soar.

Doing the hard thing isn't just progress. It's power.

She's a few years younger than me, but we hit it off straight away. We would go out, send messages on social media. For over a year we were good. 

Recently I had birthday. First I invited her and one more person from my office for a meal. Unfortunately I canceled it, mostly because of unexpected expenses and I couldn't afford to pay for their meal. But also my friend when I told her that we would go out here showed absolutely no interest. She only said in this super annoyed voice that it's ok and it doesn't matter to her anyway. Before she would always be excited and she'd message me about this. But now it was like she was not interested. I ended up canceling it. 

She messaged me saying that I am the asshole because she had a birthday gift for me and now she has to return it and that she was planning to give me a birthday cake etc. I told her that it was my decision and I can't afford paying for it all. She kept bringing up the gift and I said that if someone wants to give something to someone there is no need for a party. I got some gifts from people who i didn't even see personally due to their work and they sent the gifts to me. I said I don't care about this and I wanted to invite them for a coffee a bit later. But she blamed me for it all.

It all made me think that she is a bad influence. My boyfriend pointed this out that always after going out with her I was different in a bad way. And when I sat down and thought of this I realized that I was always turned into a bad guy when she was the victim. She was criticizing every single decision I made. 

Now some people said that I should've been the one apologizing but I have nothing to apologize for.

Staring at a giant task list? Spent hours organizing your work instead of doing it? You're not alone.

Here's a stupid simple trick that actually works: Eat That Frog.

No, not a real frog! 🐸 It means: Do your HARDEST or MOST IMPORTANT task FIRST thing in your workday. Before email. Before meetings. Before easy little tasks.

Why ""Eat That Frog"" works magic for coders and builders:

Your Brain is Freshest Early: Willpower and focus are like a full battery in the morning. Use that power on the tough stuff (debugging that complex bug, building the core feature, writing that scary email). Hard things get easier.

Stop Procrastinating Pain: That scary task hanging over you? It drains your energy all day just thinking about it. Do it FIRST and feel FREE. The rest of the day feels easier.

Momentum Builder: Knocking out the big, hard thing first gives you a HUGE win. Feeling like a superhero? Now tackle the smaller stuff!

Avoid ""Planning Trap"": It's easy to spend hours rearranging Jira tickets, making beautiful todo lists, or ""researching""... instead of actually coding or building. Planning isn't progress. Doing is.

Your Brain is Freshest Early: Willpower and focus are like a full battery in the morning. Use that power on the tough stuff (debugging that complex bug, building the core feature, writing that scary email). Hard things get easier.

Stop Procrastinating Pain: That scary task hanging over you? It drains your energy all day just thinking about it. Do it FIRST and feel FREE. The rest of the day feels easier.

Momentum Builder: Knocking out the big, hard thing first gives you a HUGE win. Feeling like a superhero? Now tackle the smaller stuff!

Avoid ""Planning Trap"": It's easy to spend hours rearranging Jira tickets, making beautiful todo lists, or ""researching""... instead of actually coding or building. Planning isn't progress. Doing is.

Small Wins Trick Your Brain: Finishing your ""frog"" gives a dopamine hit (feel-good chemical). You crave MORE wins, making it easier to keep going.

How to Actually Do It (Super Simple):

Tonight/Tomorrow Morning: Look at your list. Ask: ""What's the ONE thing I'm dreading or that really matters?"" That's your frog.

Protect Your Morning: Block 60-90 minutes FIRST THING. No distractions. Close Slack, email, Twitter. Put phone away.

JUST START: Seriously. Open your code editor, draft that email, sketch that design. Action kills anxiety. Don't overthink step 1.

Celebrate the Frog! Finished it? Even partly? HUGE WIN. Do a little dance, get coffee, feel awesome. Then move to smaller tasks.

""But what if my frog is HUGE?""

Chop it! Can't build the whole feature? Fix one specific bug within it. Write one function. Draft one section. Make the frog bite-sized.

""But I'm not a morning person?""

Use your best time. ""First thing"" means your first focused work block, whenever that is. Protect that time fiercely!

Stop letting the scary task control your day. Eat the frog first. Watch your productivity (and mood) soar.

Doing the hard thing isn't just progress. It's power.

Long time listener who looks forward to every Thursday since it’s my (28F) boyfriend’s (40m) boys night at his place. For background, we’ve been together for over a year. Him & I live separately at the moment but have plans to move in together and eventually buy a home. We have both been previously married. We still see each other 5 days a week. 

On Thursdays, he usually hangs out with one, sometimes two of his male friends. This has been a long standing tradition with them for ten years. They usually meet at his place, cook a meal, and play video games. I’ve always respected this and have even moved plans around it. I’m big on personal space and having time with your friends. Typically, no women are allowed but they’ve sometimes made an exception for my boyfriend’s bestfriend’s girlfriend. We will call her Madison. Madison and I have developed a friendship over the last year. We usually hang out with her and her boyfriend, (We’ll call him JP) once a week. A few weeks back, Madison texted me saying that one of their other friends came to boys night. I was happy about this, as the friend hasn’t been around in a few months. I asked my boyfriend why he didn’t mention it to me, knowing he had to be excited to see his friend. Somehow during conversation, it came out that Madison was also at the same hangout that night. 

To be fair, I don’t get insecure over female friendships. My bestfriend is a guy. But this rubbed me wrong. Madison didn’t mention she was there, and neither did my boyfriend. Apparently she was out at a bar nearby and JP asked if she could stop by. That turned into Madison and JP staying in the guest suite overnight. I asked why wasn’t I told about it or invited as well, he swore it was just a last minute thing and he didn’t think he had to tell me. I explained it made me feel somewhat uncomfortable and that I would like to know when others come by/stay the night, especially if it’s a female. He agreed and apologized for how I felt. We went on with our weekend. 

Last night, I was home alone listening to this week’s episode of THT. After doing some housework I went to sleep. Usually my boyfriend will send me photos/videos of everyone hanging out. I woke up to a video at 3:30 AM of a movie playing we love to watch. In the frame, there was a purse on his coffee table. I recognized it right away, it was Madison’s. But I asked anyway whose purse it was. He immediately called me. I said “Yes?” He said “I’m not going to lie to you, it’s Madison’s. She’s asleep in the guest room right now and JP is here with me watching a movie”. I asked why I wasn’t told about this. He said “I knew you’d be upset. “. I lost my mind. I started asking why it was so easy to lie to me, why even lie when I said it was okay I just want to know, and why was I once again excluded. I hung up because I was frustrated. He called back many times. I finally picked up two hours later to him saying it was his fault but he “didn’t know what the big deal was”. I reiterated how it made me feel, how we established a boundary and he broke it, and how he’s only sorry he got caught. He kept saying he was coming to my place, but I told him not to. I hung up, he sent a few more apology texts. I left the group chat I’m in with him, Madison, & JP. And went to sleep. 

I’m supposed to be going to his place today for the whole weekend. We have reservations to take his mom to dinner for her birthday. But now, I don’t know how to feel at all. I love him very much, and everyday feels like a day with my bestfriend. But I feel betrayed and lied to. I know nothing is going on between him & Madison. But why lie about it? And why is she always getting so drunk nearby my boyfriend’s house on boys night? I know her & JP have trust issues but this seems toxic and clingy. I’ve never invaded a boys night. I feel excluded and in a way, my relationship feels targeted. I’m sure we will talk today but I don’t know how I feel or if this is worth pursuing further. Am I overthinking this? Is it worth breaking up over? I don’t really want to but I feel like he’d rather lie to me than respect my feelings. Thanks for reading this far! ",2,1753451324.0,TwoHotTakes,13,0.75,False

People pretend to understand their children’s lives, but in truth, they’re often lying to themselves or their friends to save face. You wouldn’t believe how many crying mothers come to me, desperate to find their kids, only to discover them in some drug den, squandering their “college money.” That’s other people’s kids, right? Never your precious angel. But that’s the lie we tell ourselves. 
Despite our best efforts, our children are their own people, free to use their will as they choose. 

I did everything right in my parents’ eyes, especially my father’s. I graduated high school, went straight to the police academy, and climbed the ranks in my midsized city. I became the youngest chief homicide detective, partly because the previous chief succumbed to a brutal heroin addiction. 

It wasn’t long before I met Jessica, the love of my life, the most beautiful brunette God ever created. That is, until our daughter, Becca, was born—she became my entire world. Watching her grow, exploring the wonders around her, was what I looked forward to every day. Everything changed when Becca turned fourteen. 

It wasn’t teenage angst; it was Jessica’s stage-four ovarian cancer diagnosis. We were the perfect family until then—family dinners, summer vacations, never missing Becca’s extracurriculars. After the diagnosis, we grew stronger for a time, but watching the brightest light in your life fade to nothing would break even the strongest man. Seeing my frail wife take her last breath changed my fourteen-year-old daughter. 

Becca dropped all her activities and threw herself into her studies. As a father, I was proud of my honor student, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t miss her talking to me. Her high school years passed like this, but I stayed positive at home. I never wanted her to carry the weight of her broken father. 

That is until I was alone in the big, empty room where I once held my beautiful wife, the darkness sank in. It’s hard to describe the horror of that solitude. I’d sit in the middle of my bed, the walls racing in opposite directions, my skin shivering as a black hole opened in my chest, pulling in the misery the walls fled from. I didn’t cry or moan—just trembled, wishing tears would release me from that cosmic pressure. 

You might think opening up to Becca or seeking family counseling would’ve helped. I tried. For two years after Jessica’s death, we saw grief counselors, psychiatrists, you name it. It stopped the day Becca came home from school, tears in her eyes, and said, “Please, no more shrinks, Dad. They can’t bring Mom back.” Her words confused me—no one was trying to resurrect Jessica. I said, “They’re just helping you process, sweetheart.” She looked at her fidgeting hands and whispered, “I know. I just want it to stop.” That day, I saw a pain in her deeper than at her mother’s funeral. I canceled all future sessions. 

When I dropped her off at college in the next state, I told her how proud I was. She hugged me tightly and said something that seared into me: “You don’t have to pretend to be strong anymore.” It was four years before she contacted me again. 

I lasted six months before I started drinking. Even though Becca rarely spoke when she was home, she gave me purpose, a reason to hold it together. But her words haunted me like a broken record: “You don’t have to pretend to be strong anymore.” I kept my job for another six months before taking early retirement at fifty. I wasn’t ready to stop working, but my drinking had taken over, affecting my ability to lead. I’d sneak drinks at work, chuckling to myself, “At least it’s not heroin—this job must be cursed.” I didn’t want to end up a disgrace like my predecessor, so retirement was the logical choice. 

I sold my home, downsized to a smaller place, hoping the walls wouldn’t race away. They did, and the void in my chest remained. With my remaining money, I bought a small office and became a private investigator, figuring I was the only boss who wouldn’t fire me for drinking. 

The next three years blurred with cases of infidelity, wayward kids, and odd jobs—until Becca called. At three a.m., I woke groggy, still buzzed, but her voice sobered me instantly. “Daddy, please come get me,” she said, followed by unintelligible garble. I always knew her location through Find My iPhone—not to stalk her, but because I never stopped paying her bills to support her through college. 

Her annual transcripts, sent without words, were her way of saying she was okay and thanking me. I didn’t need her calls, just confirmation she was safe. 

That night, she was ready. I drove like a man possessed to an oversized frat party. There, I found a brown-haired, blue-eyed girl slumped against a red sports car. It was Becca, just sleeping. I carried her to my car. 

The next morning, she woke to the smell of pancakes and me in the kitchen. Despite her hangover, her face lit up, and she rushed me with a bear hug, apologizing for not calling, saying she loved me over and over. Apparently, a sorority girl bragging about a Lake Tahoe trip with her father had triggered her, leading to drunken tears and her call to me.

This amazing driver out in Raccoon Valley decided to cut the corner a bit early causing me to brake earlier and harder than I normally would have. In true Joe Diffie fashion. Car cut the corner... slammed on the brakes... coffee went flying forward and the coffee exploded all over the cab. I wouldn't be as mad but it takes 30 minutes to get to town for good coffee and 30 minutes to get home because I live all the way out in the country... All for this guy to ruin my coffee trip about 5 minutes from home.

1m8zm0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1m8zm0b/how_well_do_you_know_your_children_part_1/,How Well Do You Know Your Children part 1,"People pretend to understand their children’s lives, but in truth, they’re often lying to themselves or their friends to save face. You wouldn’t believe how many crying mothers come to me, desperate to find their kids, only to discover them in some drug den, squandering their “college money.” That’s other people’s kids, right? Never your precious angel. But that’s the lie we tell ourselves. 
Despite our best efforts, our children are their own people, free to use their will as they choose. 

I did everything right in my parents’ eyes, especially my father’s. I graduated high school, went straight to the police academy, and climbed the ranks in my midsized city. I became the youngest chief homicide detective, partly because the previous chief succumbed to a brutal heroin addiction. 

It wasn’t long before I met Jessica, the love of my life, the most beautiful brunette God ever created. That is, until our daughter, Becca, was born—she became my entire world. Watching her grow, exploring the wonders around her, was what I looked forward to every day. Everything changed when Becca turned fourteen. 

It wasn’t teenage angst; it was Jessica’s stage-four ovarian cancer diagnosis. We were the perfect family until then—family dinners, summer vacations, never missing Becca’s extracurriculars. After the diagnosis, we grew stronger for a time, but watching the brightest light in your life fade to nothing would break even the strongest man. Seeing my frail wife take her last breath changed my fourteen-year-old daughter. 

Becca dropped all her activities and threw herself into her studies. As a father, I was proud of my honor student, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t miss her talking to me. Her high school years passed like this, but I stayed positive at home. I never wanted her to carry the weight of her broken father. 

That is until I was alone in the big, empty room where I once held my beautiful wife, the darkness sank in. It’s hard to describe the horror of that solitude. I’d sit in the middle of my bed, the walls racing in opposite directions, my skin shivering as a black hole opened in my chest, pulling in the misery the walls fled from. I didn’t cry or moan—just trembled, wishing tears would release me from that cosmic pressure. 

You might think opening up to Becca or seeking family counseling would’ve helped. I tried. For two years after Jessica’s death, we saw grief counselors, psychiatrists, you name it. It stopped the day Becca came home from school, tears in her eyes, and said, “Please, no more shrinks, Dad. They can’t bring Mom back.” Her words confused me—no one was trying to resurrect Jessica. I said, “They’re just helping you process, sweetheart.” She looked at her fidgeting hands and whispered, “I know. I just want it to stop.” That day, I saw a pain in her deeper than at her mother’s funeral. I canceled all future sessions. 

When I dropped her off at college in the next state, I told her how proud I was. She hugged me tightly and said something that seared into me: “You don’t have to pretend to be strong anymore.” It was four years before she contacted me again. 

I lasted six months before I started drinking. Even though Becca rarely spoke when she was home, she gave me purpose, a reason to hold it together. But her words haunted me like a broken record: “You don’t have to pretend to be strong anymore.” I kept my job for another six months before taking early retirement at fifty. I wasn’t ready to stop working, but my drinking had taken over, affecting my ability to lead. I’d sneak drinks at work, chuckling to myself, “At least it’s not heroin—this job must be cursed.” I didn’t want to end up a disgrace like my predecessor, so retirement was the logical choice. 

I sold my home, downsized to a smaller place, hoping the walls wouldn’t race away. They did, and the void in my chest remained. With my remaining money, I bought a small office and became a private investigator, figuring I was the only boss who wouldn’t fire me for drinking. 

The next three years blurred with cases of infidelity, wayward kids, and odd jobs—until Becca called. At three a.m., I woke groggy, still buzzed, but her voice sobered me instantly. “Daddy, please come get me,” she said, followed by unintelligible garble. I always knew her location through Find My iPhone—not to stalk her, but because I never stopped paying her bills to support her through college. 

Her annual transcripts, sent without words, were her way of saying she was okay and thanking me. I didn’t need her calls, just confirmation she was safe. 

That night, she was ready. I drove like a man possessed to an oversized frat party. There, I found a brown-haired, blue-eyed girl slumped against a red sports car. It was Becca, just sleeping. I carried her to my car. 

The next morning, she woke to the smell of pancakes and me in the kitchen. Despite her hangover, her face lit up, and she rushed me with a bear hug, apologizing for not calling, saying she loved me over and over. Apparently, a sorority girl bragging about a Lake Tahoe trip with her father had triggered her, leading to drunken tears and her call to me. 

That sorority girl was the best thing to happen to me in years—she gave me my daughter back. Becca was now the happy, strong woman her mother had been before the cancer. Over the next few days, she shared her life: her law major, her love for yoga, and why she’d stayed silent.

Quit 6 Years of Heavy Coffee Use — 18 Days In and Still Struggling Badly

Body:
I’ve been drinking coffee daily for the past 6 years, and not just a cup or two — I used to mix 4 teaspoons of instant coffee directly into water and drink that in the morning, every single day. No milk, no sugar, just strong caffeine to kickstart my brain.

I finally quit on June 18, so today is Day 35 caffeine-free.

I haven’t touched a drop of coffee or tea since. But honestly, it’s still really tough.

Here’s what I’m dealing with:

Low motivation

Low energy

Kind of sad and depressed

Still having intense brain fog

Waking up at night —at 3–4 AM, and I can’t fall back asleep

I go to sleep at 10:40 PM consistently, but I don’t feel rested


I didn’t expect the recovery to take this long. I thought things would improve after 7–10 days, but I still feel stuck. No cravings, just a very foggy and flat brain. I’m trying to eat well and stay consistent, but some days are rough.

Has anyone else gone through this after long-term, high-dose caffeine use?
How long did it take for you to start feeling normal again — mentally sharp, motivated, and emotionally stable?

Any advice or encouragement would really help.

When I first came across it, I wasn’t sure how something so small could make a difference. With its promise of decluttering wires on mixers, coffee makers, pressure cookers, and more, I decided to give it a try and put it to the test.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
The product stood out right away with its minimalist design. It’s crafted from high-quality rubber that feels durable, and true to its claims, it resists deformation even when tugged upon. The nano tape adhesive on the back was another point of curiosity; this “super sticky,” odorless material promised no sticky residue, something I can’t compromise on. After cleaning the surfaces of my blender and coffee maker, the installation process was simple enough to follow, as long as you’re patient and let the adhesive set for the recommended six hours. Still, I had my doubts about how well it’d hold up over time.  

[Find the best price for Daisyhome CO-NV-2024 Cord Organizer on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0dg8hrxpq/)  

**How It Works (And Does It?)**  
This organizer features three slots designed to handle wires of varying diameters, a small but clever element that makes it versatile for different kitchen appliances. My coffee maker’s cord fit snugly in the middle slot, while the thinner wire of my toaster slotted perfectly into the outer groove. Wrapping cords was easy, though I noticed bulkier wires (such as those on my air fryer) required the entire organizer, leaving no room for additional cords. It didn’t take long to appreciate how much cleaner my countertop looked, thanks to one small upgrade.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Clean and neat organization for messy kitchen cords.  
- Versatile slots handle various wire diameters.  
- Adhesive is strong yet doesn’t leave sticky residue.  

**Negatives**  
- Not great for heavier appliance cords like stand mixers.  
- Requires careful surface cleaning and installation to adhere securely.  

**Who Should Consider This?**  
If you’re a neat freak or someone who can’t stand cluttered counters, this item is a game-changer. For those with an air fryer, pressure cooker, or a fleet of kitchen gadgets, it makes a noticeable difference in tidying things up. On the other hand, if you own one or two major appliances with heavy, thick cords, you might need something designed explicitly for bulkier cables.  

**Product Contenders**  
While testing the Daisyhome CO-NV-2024 Cord Organizer, I found similar products like the Cord Wrapper Pro and the Ez Organizing Cable Tamer. The Cord Wrapper Pro scored higher for its load-bearing capacity, making it ideal for larger machines like a mixer or a portable grill. However, its design wasn’t as sleek or rubbery, limiting its aesthetic and flexibility. The Ez Organizing Cable Tamer excelled in adhesive strength (perfect for uneven surfaces), but it fumbled in handling thinner wires consistently. Where the Daisyhome product punches above the rest is versatility—it performs beautifully in most cases.  

**Budget-Friendly**  
One of the biggest selling points is its affordability, especially when stacked against its competitors. Even better, these come in an 8-pack, giving you more bang for your buck. You can pretty much reorganize your whole kitchen for a fraction of what pricier options would cost. While some might debate its longevity, for the price, I don’t see how you could go wrong.

1m8zecz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToolTales/comments/1m8zecz/explore_the_bissell_big_green_pet_pro_carpet/,Explore the BISSELL Big Green Pet Pro Carpet Steamer review for ultimate cleaning performance!,"The **BISSELL Big Green PET PRO Carpet Cleaner 3288** has truly proven to be a game-changer in my daily battle against pet-related messes. With two dogs that seem to think my carpet is their playground, and a cat who prefers to test the durability of my upholstery, I had no choice but to give this hefty carpet cleaning machine a try. After weeks of consistent use, the results are in, and while it’s not exactly flawless, it delivers a powerful performance that's tough to beat. Let’s unpack all the details.

**Professional-Grade Cleaning Power**

This machine is an absolute beast when it comes to tackling stubborn pet stains. Its 8-row XL DirtLifter PowerBrush is genuinely impressive in lifting embedded dirt and pet hair from my carpets and rugs. I had this one area near the coffee table that’s been a mystery stain for months, thanks to who knows which pet, and the cleaner erased it like magic. With its corded-electric power source, you can run it without worrying about losing cleaning performance halfway through the job.

**Usability and Comfort**

At first glance, the BISSELL Big Green PET PRO looks intimidating with its industrial design. But surprisingly, it’s quite user-friendly. The ergonomic handle made gripping and maneuvering around my home a lot easier than I expected. It’s not lightweight, but the sturdy build makes it feel durable. However, it does take a little muscle to move across thick carpets. Someone with limited mobility might find this a downside. 

[Ready to snag BISSELL Big Green PET PRO Carpet Cleaner 3288? See Amazon’s price.](https://measuringworld.com/p/b09xfh7b5s/)

**Tackles Specific Pet Challenges**

One of the most touted perks of this cleaner is its ability to extract odors from pet urine. I was skeptical, but the included BISSELL PET PRO Oxy Urine Eliminator Formula worked wonders. Not only did it leave my carpets smelling fresh, but it also handled the occasional surprise mess on the upholstery using the 9-inch long reach hose and tools. Bonus points for versatility! 

**Water Tank System**

The dual-tank system is one of the most brilliant features here. The separate tanks for clean and dirty water meant there was no cross-contamination, which I truly appreciated after seeing the gunk pulled from my carpets. Plus, the tank capacity is fantastic. I didn’t have to make frequent trips to refill or empty the machine, which helped streamline my cleaning routine.

**Strengths**

- Cleans better than rental machines, leaving carpets noticeably fresher.  
- Pet-friendly formula specifically targets stains and odors.  
- Sturdy, ergonomic build minimizes discomfort during prolonged use.  
- Versatile nine-inch reach hose and tools make upholstery cleaning a breeze.  

**Critiques**

- Weightier than expected, making it a challenge to haul upstairs.  
- Bulky design requires significant storage space.  
- Drains water slower on low-pile carpets, leaving them damp for longer.  

**Competing Products**

Compared to its competitors, like the Rug Doctor Deep Carpet Cleaner and the Hoover SmartWash Pet Complete, the BISSELL Big Green PET PRO stands out in terms of power and build quality. The Rug Doctor has a competitive cleaning ability but feels heavier to maneuver. On the other hand, the Hoover SmartWash is lighter and offers a one-step cleaning solution, though it doesn’t quite match the BISSELL’s ability to handle tough pet stains.

Where this device really outshines the competition is its commitment to pet-friendly cleaning. With every purchase supporting the BISSELL Pet Foundation, I couldn’t help but love the philanthropic twist.

**Affordable Quality**

When evaluating its price in the context of its features, this product makes a strong case for itself. It’s a significant upfront investment, but considering the professional-grade cleaning and the cost you’d save on renting carpet cleaners over time, it’s well worth the expense. If pets are turning your carpet into a Jackson Pollock painting, this cleaner is truly a sound investment.

1m8zb44,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1m8zb44/does_the_bosch_shpm78z55n_dishwasher_deliver_on/,Does the Bosch SHPM78Z55N Dishwasher Deliver on CrystalDry Promises?,"Let me share my hands-on experience with the Bosch SHPM78Z55N dishwasher – my new kitchen buddy. I’ve put it through its paces for weeks now, cramming it full of everything from greasy pans to delicate glassware, and it certainly made an impression. This isn't the first dishwasher I've dealt with, but here's the good, the bad, and everything in between.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This dishwasher is a looker. Its stainless steel finish screams modern elegance, blending effortlessly into my kitchen’s aesthetic. The pocket handle is a neat touch – sleek and understated, without those bulky protrusions some other models feature. Its dimensions (23.75"" D x 23.56"" W x 33.88"" H) fit seamlessly into my built-in slot. Inside, the stainless steel construction feels sturdy and promises durability. When unloading it, I realized Bosch wasn’t messing around with materials. It feels like it can withstand years of abuse from hurried hands and clumsy dish stacking.  

**Performance and Cleaning Ability**  
The cleaning performance was something I was genuinely curious about. I threw everything its way – stuck-on lasagna, dried oatmeal bowls, and coffee-stained mugs – just to test the limits. Thanks to the PrecisionWash technology, which uses sensors to monitor and target every corner of the items inside, I didn’t have to pre-rinse my dishes. Even with my skepticism, each load ended shiny and spotless, especially the glassware.  

[Check Bosch SHPM78Z55N price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b07wd62xr9/)

**Special Features That Stood Out**  
One of the standout features is the CrystalDry technology. Imagine unloading your dishes and having even plastic items bone-dry – that’s exactly what it does. It dries dishes by turning moisture into intense heat (up to 176°F) and works wonders even on hard-to-dry items like reusable food containers. The Flexible third rack is a boon when it comes to those odd-sized utensils or extra silverware. I was pleasantly surprised with how much it expanded the overall capacity – no more running multiple cycles because of a few extra utensils. The InfoLight, which beams on the kitchen floor when the machine is running, might seem like a minor thing, but with how quiet this machine runs, it’s nice not to second-guess if you forgot to start it.  

**Operation Sound**  
Noise level sits impressively at just 42 dB, making it one of the quietest dishwashers I’ve had the pleasure of running. I’ve had conversations directly above it while it purred quietly in the background. Late-night dishwashing isn’t a nuisance anymore, even with a sleeping baby in the next room.  

**Positives**  
Here are some of the highlights that stood out to me during usage:  

- CrystalDry technology ensures dishes come out dry – even plastic.  
- Noise level at 42 dB keeps it ultra-quiet.  
- Flexible third rack expands the interior capacity for utensils.  
- Sleek and modern stainless steel design with a functional pocket handle.  

**Deficiencies**  
While overall impressive, there are a couple of hurdles:  

- The 3-prong power cord is included, but if you prefer hardwiring, you need to buy a separate junction box.  
- Cycle durations can be long, which might bother anyone looking for quick turns.  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this model to other household names like Whirlpool and Samsung dishwashers in the same price range, Bosch has a clear edge in drying performance. Whirlpool’s drying technology often struggled with plastic containers, leaving them wet every time I tried. Samsung models, though stylish and efficient, fell behind in terms of operational noise, running noticeably louder during cycles. Where Bosch trails slightly is the simplistic LED display interface. While effective, some models from Samsung have sleeker controls and app integrations, which this model doesn’t offer. Despite this, Bosch outshines most brands with cleaning thoroughness and its CrystalDry feature.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Admittedly, this dishwasher sits on the higher end of the pricing scale, but with its performance and unique technology, I’d say it’s worth every penny. Despite the premium price tag, the peace of mind knowing I no longer have to stand by the sink scrubbing off stubborn grime is justifiable. And considering its longevity and effectiveness, I think it balances long-term value and upfront investment admirably.

1m8zake,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1m8zake/multiverseposting/,MultiVerse-Posting,"So I continue to throw this into the stars spinning my webs throughout the Universe.

May My Father In Heaven Be My Sails.

Hey, 👋 weird and awkward and I doubt you’re even in any of these subs however.


I’m throwing this out because the last two times I went by for some 7 everything oddly lined up.

I can’t lie I was asking for some sort of guidance from my Father “The universe maker”

And oddly enough I had been able to see you talk to you and then….Intrusion….i didn’t take it as bad he was doing his job and you had just happen to say hi.

But thinking back anytime I come by you pop out or try and say hi.

You tell everyone Mr.C… is a great guy

Oh that’s Mr.c

While it’s odd hearing someone call me Mr.

I know you’re just being respectful.

I like that but the first time we talked I complimented your neckless I thought it was Sumerian and you had corrected me and I already forgot but it was months ago.

I did complement your goddess neckless.

It reminded me of the fertility Goddess but more so reminded me of deans neckless.

You know from supernatural.

But I just wanted to say I appreciate seeing you and having someone seem interested in talking or seeing me.

I’m very guarded and it wasn’t weird or anything now I seek it in return but I’m definitely cautious you know my name and speak so highly of me it seems even to co workers I leave after getting my coffee and my ear burns the good side…so I believe maybe it’s you talking to your coworker the one that was very overly nice but I wasn’t even looking towards her I turned that corner saw you and….Damn…🙃 

Here I am writing this getting high and forgot about my food….but it’s been a long time since someone threw me off like this it’s hard when I’m so guarded.

Maybe your just being nice is what I convince myself that it’s just part of your job.

That’s it your nice and friendly because your job?

Sorry I’m just confused slightly because you made a joke….so this gives it away big time….you had asked if it was me because I didn’t get the Banana Bread. Instead I got my old drink I didn’t drink 24/7 like the banana bread.

But yea this is how I’m gonna work through it.

Don’t get me wrong I definitely wanted to go back and see about talking to you more but that’s weird…

Even though we had laughed about me being a doppelgänger because I didn’t get the banana bread. My response was no it’s just me…..you continued and I responded with…. as far as I know I don’t have a doppelgänger and you laughed.

I kind of laughed slightly inside because you hit 6 instead of 5 and I’ve done that kind of thing on any touch screen.

So leaving this here and telling myself it’s just you being kind and expressing yourself at work. 

It doesn’t mean we had any chemistry or anything.

If we did I would like to understand it better.

Only time will be the judge but writing it helps the best I would love to be that guy that makes you feel special for going out of my way and coming back just to talk to you.

However without  better understanding I don’t want to be that weird guy that comes through and makes it awkward.


😬 Yikes but this is interesting definitely asked for some kind of clarification with you.  I prayed and each time I saw you.

Each time we’d notice each other try and talk something would happen you got busy or the other employee out spoke you and wouldn’t let you say almost anything to me and I was just like…

but I would have rather talked to Her first…

that’s another thing you know my first and last name…..

I don’t need to know your name however I’d like to know so I can stop referring to you in my own words as “Her” 
I’d ask 100% I just don’t want to upset or make you feel uncomfortable that’s the issue dear and self doubt. Respecting your own boundaries I’ve made up in my head. 🤷



But last night we talked it was something that definitely made my night seeing you and being able to enjoy talking to you without the hassle of the world it was dead and I didn’t have coffee all day.

so after my tasks I went for coffee not expecting you I didn’t even pray about it or you or anything and boom….💥 as I round the corner I see you. You know it’s not fair right?

I can’t exist in sorrow for too long?
I’m glad someone has turned my eyes towards the light while I try to follow The light of my Spirit.

 the worlds darkness easily can diminish that flame, thank you for being a light even if temporary.


I’ll do the only thing I know that leads my sails…..Pray….Ask God and have him lead me.  I’ve been stranded for quite some time.

But I’ve asked prayed and been reading my bible more then what’s been common for myself.

The more devotion I show the more of a response on guidance I seem to be getting buts it’s just very strange how everything is going Smoothly that’s the thing I’ve heard….


If it’s a door from god there isn’t any discomfort it’s easy and smooth comfortable.


If it’s something that’s uncomfortable or causes you grief it’s probably not a door from god.


Using this and asking with obedience I’ve started to get alot of guidance.


Just FYI this is my perspective and my experience.


I wish someone could remove emotions.

I keep getting a pull I want to persuade however I over analyze over think and I re-weight my scales 1000 times to many.

After spending almost every morning with this electric Cuban coffee maker, I’ve got plenty to share about both its strengths and weaknesses. Let's dive right in.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffee maker gives off a modern, stylish vibe with its black metallic finish and a lightweight build. The dimensions, measuring 5.12”D x 7.48”W x 10.63”H, make it compact enough to sit comfortably on a crowded kitchen counter. The transparent container on the top? That’s probably my favorite touch. Watching the brewing process in action feels oddly satisfying and luxurious, like my morning coffee routine suddenly got fancier. The BPA-free food-grade plastic and aluminum build also make it safe, which is always a huge plus. 

**Ease of Use**  
This is where the LAOION Espresso Maker truly shines. I can practically make coffee while half-asleep, and that’s saying something. There’s no heat stove or complex process involved. Just fill up the water, add medium-ground coffee to the funnel filter, tighten everything together, and hit the button. Five minutes later, you’ve got yourself a cup of rich, aromatic espresso. The simplicity of operation takes what could have been an intimidating gadget and makes it beginner-friendly.

[Check LAOION Espresso Maker price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0bp6ntd1p/)

**Portability and Versatility**  
This little machine is surprisingly portable. Its 6-cup size is compact enough to pack up and take to an office, campsite, or even a weekend getaway. It’s become my new travel partner for quick caffeine fixes during early road trips. Whatever your destination, having a private coffee shop experience in five minutes is unbeatable. Plus, the fact that it supports various coffee styles—espresso, mocha, latte, and cappuccino—makes it a mini coffee powerhouse.

**Efforts Toward Safety**  
One of my coworkers borrowed this machine once and was impressed with its safety features. The auto shut-off works seamlessly. If you remove the pot from its detachable electric base during brewing, it immediately cuts the power. Additionally, the heating process stops right when the coffee reaches its boiling point. These are thoughtful layers of protection that prevent accidents, especially when you’re as absent-minded before coffee as I am.

**Advantages**  
Let’s take a second to list some of the key perks.  
- Compact and modern design, fitting for small spaces.  
- Transparent container makes the brewing process enjoyable.  
- Super simple operation suited for beginners.  
- Portable and easy to use on the go.

**Areas for Improvement**  
Look, nothing is perfect, and this coffee maker is no exception. Here are a few points that stood out:  
- The 6-cup capacity might feel a little small in families with several coffee drinkers.  
- The bottom aluminum pot could be prone to wear if not dried thoroughly after cleaning.  
- It's slightly noisier than expected, especially during brewing, which could be a buzzkill for early mornings.

**Market Rivals**  
How does this espresso maker fare compared to industry heavyweights like the Bialetti Moka Express or Breville Bambino? Well, it occupies a unique middle ground. Bialetti offers that traditional stovetop charm but lacks the plug-and-brew simplicity here. Breville Bambino, on the other hand, is a beast for full-scale coffee customization but comes with a hefty price tag and steeper learning curve. The LAOION Espresso Maker holds its own by being portable, affordable, and absurdly easy to operate. While it may not deliver barista-grade espresso like Breville, its convenience factor makes it an everyday winner for me.

**Smart Spending**  
The pricing feels fair for what this espresso maker delivers. I’ve seen plenty of machines that charge double for the same performance. Given its safety features, sleek design, and portability, it hits a sweet spot on the price-value scale. If your priority is a quick, no-hassle morning coffee experience, this might just be the machine for you.

I have to admit, I wasn’t expecting the Hamilton Beach 46200 to fit so seamlessly into my crowded kitchen counter setup. Between my toaster, mixer, and some clutter I refuse to acknowledge, space is a premium in my household. The compact design of this 12-cup programmable drip coffee maker genuinely lives up to its promise—slipping under the cabinets without any awkward overhang. The sleek black exterior with stainless steel accents elevates its look, adding a modern charm that fits right in. It's lightweight at just over five pounds, which makes it easier to nudge around when reorganizing.  

**Ease of Operation: A Button-Pusher’s Dream**  
The top-mounted digital controls caught my eye immediately. Positioned conveniently on the top panel, these buttons make each step of brewing straightforward even in half-asleep zombie mode (trust me, I’ve tested it early in the morning). The easy-touch programming is a lifesaver—it lets you prep the coffee maker up to 24 hours in advance. Coming down to freshly brewed coffee first thing in the morning feels almost luxurious.  

**[Grab Hamilton Beach 46200 at the best price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0832nqnx8/)**  

**Brew Customization for the Picky Coffee Lover**  
One of the best features here is the Select-a-Brew option. You can switch between regular and bold settings depending on your mood or how much of a kick you need to start the day. My partner’s preference leans towards mild coffee, while I enjoy mine strong like jet fuel—this feature keeps us both happy, which is a rarity in shared morning routines.  

**Carafe Quality That Eliminates Spills**  
The borosilicate glass carafe deserves a special mention. Not only does it feel more robust compared to typical glass offerings, but the no-drip spout works wonders. Cleaning up spills and dribbles used to drive me nuts with my previous coffee maker. This one, however, ensures the coffee pours into the mug—not onto my kitchen counter. It holds enough to fuel a family brunch or a long workday without repeatedly brewing.  

**Safety and Comfort**  
As someone who often gets distracted by work calls (or the occasional Netflix binge), the 2-hour automatic shutoff feature is a huge relief. It prevents me from worrying whether I left the machine running—I can let my forgetful tendencies off the hook.  

**Positives**  
- Space-saving compact design ideal for smaller kitchens.  
- Durable borosilicate glass carafe with no-drip spout.  
- Intuitive top-mounted digital controls with easy programming.  
- Brew strength selector for customizable coffee.  
- Automatic shutoff that adds peace of mind.  

**Critiques**  
- The water reservoir isn’t removable, so cleaning it thoroughly can require effort.  
- It’s a little noisier than I’d expected during brewing.  
- The reusable filter is convenient but may still occasionally let finer grounds through.  

**Product Contenders**  
While testing this machine, I couldn’t resist comparing it to popular alternatives like the Keurig K-Classic and the Cuisinart DCC-3200. The Keurig’s single-serve feature is fantastic for minimizing waste but can’t match the multiple servings made by the 12-cup capacity here. The Cuisinart model boasts more advanced elements like a charcoal water filter and adjustable hot plate temperature, though it comes at a much steeper price point and larger size. For those who prioritize simplicity and space-saving features without compromising on quality, the Hamilton Beach coffee maker stands out quite strongly.  

**True Value**  
When weighing all the features this coffee maker offers—compactness, brew customization, and thoughtful shutoff functionality—against its cost, it sits firmly in the affordable quality segment. Comparable machines with the same programming capacity and design finesse often cost noticeably more. In my experience so far, this product ticks many boxes without stretching the budget unnecessarily.

1m8z8bn,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1m8z8bn/explore_if_raw_basics_laundry_detergent_sheets/,Explore if RAW BASICS laundry detergent sheets deliver zero waste solutions review,"The RAW BASICS B0BNLVDZ6T laundry detergent sheets have been a surprising addition to my daily household routine. Typically, I’m someone who sticks to the usual liquid detergents, but these sheets caught my attention with their eco-friendly promise and minimalist packaging. After a few weeks of use, I can confidently say these detergent sheets bring a refreshing twist to simplifying laundry while addressing environmental concerns. But, like any product, they come with both highs and lows. 

**Compact and Thoughtful Design**  
The first thing I noticed about these detergent sheets is their simplicity. Packaged in unbleached cardboard, they’re lightweight, compact, and perfect for limited spaces. For someone like me, who lives in an apartment with no room for bulky detergent bottles, it’s a game-changer. The zero-waste philosophy of these sheets is evident since the packaging decomposes quickly without contributing to plastic pollution. This detail makes me feel like I’m doing a small part for the environment every time I do laundry.  

[Check RAW BASICS B0BNLVDZ6T price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0bnlvdz6t/)  

**Performance That Surprised Me**  
When it comes to removing stains, these sheets hold their ground. I've tested them on everything from coffee spills to grass stains on my kid’s clothes. The enzymatic technology in these sheets truly digs deep into fabrics, lifting even the most stubborn dirt without fading colors. The whites looked whiter, the colors retained their vibrancy, and there’s no soapy residue left behind. For heavy stains, I used a full sheet, but for regular dirt, tearing one in half did the trick—stretching the 50 sheets provided into up to 100 uses!  

**Safe and Unscented**  
One of the reasons I turned to these detergent sheets was the unscented formula because someone in my house has sensitive skin. Traditional detergents often left their skin irritated, but these sheets worked without causing any discomfort. With no artificial fragrances infiltrating the laundry, they’re incredibly gentle. I would caution, however, that if you prefer your clothes to have that signature “laundry fresh” scent, you may want to pair these with a fabric refresher.  

**Portability is a Blessing**  
As a parent who frequently goes on camping trips with the family, these sheets have quickly become my go-to travel solution. I can't count the number of times I’ve had liquid detergents leak in my luggage. These are different: slim, solid sheets that weigh practically nothing. They don’t just deliver cleanliness; they bring peace of mind. Trust me, having something this light and efficient for trips is worth its weight in gold.  

**Highlights**  
- Plastic-free, environmentally-friendly packaging.  
- Effectively lifts stains while preserving fabric quality.  
- Can be portioned easily for light or heavy loads.  

**Areas of Improvement**  
Despite their many merits, there are a few points worth mentioning:  
- While the lack of fragrance works for skin sensitivity, it might not appeal to people who love the fresh scent in their laundry.  
- These sheets are more expensive upfront than some traditional liquid or powder detergents. In the long run, stretching them for 100 uses balances this out, but it’s something to consider.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to something like Tru Earth or Earth Breeze detergent sheets, RAW BASICS shines in minimal packaging and offering up to 100 uses per box. However, Tru Earth provides 64 or 32-load options, which may suit households with different needs. Earth Breeze, on the other hand, frequently markets its charity programs, which might appeal to socially minded shoppers. RAW BASICS focuses more heavily on uncompromised cleaning power and a softer introduction for sensitive skin.   

**Worth Every Penny**  
Although the pricing may sit slightly higher on the spectrum, it’s hard to argue with the value this product delivers. It’s a sustainable switch that reduces waste while getting the job done effectively. In my opinion, you’re not just paying for detergent; you’re investing in a cleaner planet and a more streamlined laundry experience.

A year ago, I was overweight, unhealthy, po\*n addict and not doing much with my life. After the breakup, I decided to join the gym and focus on becoming better. I stopped drinking and eating junk food and stopped all my bad habits. ***Ya'll are welcome to visit my profile and judge my photos lol***

In ten months, I got fit and in best shape of my life. I started getting attention and I have been told I look better than before. I feel I can't just use the moment for my favor. I feel I have some kind of part time social anxiety when I am around people.

Weekdays 5 days a week I am busy at work and gym. I only get go outside on weekends like dance class and coffee shops where i read books. In dance studio I enjoy dancing, but when I’m in a room full of strangers (mostly women), I don’t always feel like myself. It’s like I shrink a bit instead of opening up and unable to talk to anyone. Most people in dance studio know each other.

I do get attention in my regular coffee shops, but I just don't approach anyone, and I also don't want to be recognized by staff as guy who keeps hitting on chicks on same coffee shop. People in work find me entertaining as i know them since 3 years. Its just hard to break ice with new people these days. I am trying to read books that help me to go out of comfort zones and help on avoiding small talk.

So far in last 7 months I have only approached 3 girls and all from gym. So far 1 gave her number, other two had boyfriend. The chick I got number I really lost interest on her as we kept talking small talk in gym and I got frustrated. I don't think gym is a great place to do all this thing lol.

Some days I feel outgoing, confident, and can hold great conversations. But other days, my social battery is so low that even if I get the chance to talk to someone attractive, I just make small talk and walk away. I don’t really know why it happens. I am really lost as of now as nothing is happening anyway. Dating apps are waste of time at this point. I feel it's better outside to try than dating apps lol. Forgot to mention this that most of the time I’m surrounded by people who aren’t from my background. Not sure if anything has to with this or not

1m8z5as,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1m8z5as/i_need_your_help/,I need your help,"Hello ladies and gentlemen,

I come to you all with somewhat of an ethical dilemma.

Here’s a bit of context for you, back in the day, I used to be a bit of a player, right - when I say this, I mean, I know my way around how to be toxic and how to not give a f*** about what’s happening. I really developed the craft when I was at Uni. 

Enough about me and back to the topic at hand… a few weeks ago, there was a girl from the gym (employee) who showed a lot of interest in myself, to which I was obviously pretty keen to explore. For reference, everything I learnt about being a player, I threw out the window as I genuinely liked this girl… she was really my type. We got talking, she heard some stories about me (from 2 years ago) and she kind of got scared but one of my mates girlfriends eased things out for me, so we went and got coffee and after coffee, she asked if I wanted to go out for dinner, to which, naturally, I said yes.

This is where the issue starts, when we got dinner, she made mention that she has her own uni starting up in the following week and she was genuinely very stressed out about it - it was very clear to see. Anyhoo, at the end of the date, she wanted to organise a movie date, again, this is something I said yes to. 

The day after the date, I explained everything that happened at the date to the boys at work, but specifically, I made mention that she was very stressed out about uni and whether or not it would be a nice thing to do to buy her flowers as a way of saying ‘please don’t stress out about uni - I genuinely care’ (not sure if it makes sense). Anyhoo, as the story goes, I went out of my way to buy some flowers and snuck them into the gym when I went next and gave them to her. 

When I gave them to her, she was genuinely so happy - the smile on her face was beaming and she made mention of how much she loves fresh flowers. When I left the gym, I asked if we were still on for the movies and she said yes BUT we didn’t organise anything as there was nothing good on (I’d already seen the F1 movie, she’d already seen Superman, all the other movies sucked etc.). 

The problem comes after this. The day after the flowers, we had a quick phone call to which there was no problems… literally everything was fine. I just wanted to ask how she was as there was a gym member who was giving her a hard time - everything was fine and dandy on this (I went to watch a sports game when she was at work so I called her at halftime). The day after this, I saw her at the gym and the vibes were just a little bit off… I asked at the gym if I could give her another call later that night just to talk, nothing else really to it. She asked if it was anything serious and I said (satirically) “very serious” and she acknowledged that it was a joke and said that she might not be able to answer, dependant on what she was doing. Anyhoo, I tried giving her a call later that night and she didn’t pick up. NOTHING wrong with it… people are busy, right?

Well… I opted to not text her for the week as my life was genuinely busy and… as I was overthinking everything… I didn’t want to bother her (thankfully I didn’t).

I found out today, by aforementioned friends girlfriend that the flowers were too much and that it was a “fatal blow”.

Now, this is the first proper time I’ve tried to play everything by the book. I’ve since asked various other people for their opinion (men and women) and the men all said it’s a nice thing and the women have said they’d of swooned over whoever bought them flowers and or been very happy at the least. 

I just want other people’s opinions, as everyone I’ve asked has probably given me a biased answer and answers that have been an attempt to make me feel better about myself and what I did. I agree that maybe the flowers were too much, which I really want to address with her when I see her at the gym next… but are they really too much? Do I ask if she wants to do something - like watching a movie? I genuinely do like the girl and would like something to happen but where I thought I was doing a nice thing has turned to really bite me on the backside. Help and advice is needed, as I said, I’m a player BUT when it comes to actually making a meaningful connection, I have no clue. 

Maybe there’s some details I’m missing, feel free to ask away in the comments and I’ll reply. 

I genuinely just want to know what others would do if they were in my boots - as I said, do I try to organise something next? Were the flowers too much?

1m8z4ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1m8z4ia/anyone_else_feel_like_theyre_drowning_in/,Anyone else feel like they're drowning in loneliness but can't explain it to anyone? 🫡,"I'm 27M and I don't really know how to say this without sounding pathetic, but I'm so fucking lonely it's starting to scare me.

It's not even about not having friends or whatever. I mean, I talk to people. I go out sometimes. But there's this constant feeling like I'm behind glass, you know? Like everyone else got some manual for how to connect with people and I missed the day they handed it out.

I quit my office job a few months ago because I was dying inside. Now I'm freelancing as a designer, which is what I always wanted, but holy shit the isolation is brutal. Some days I don't talk to another human being except to order coffee.

The worst part is when I do try to open up to someone about feeling this way, their eyes kind of glaze over. Or they give me the whole ""have you tried going to the gym?"" speech. Like, thanks Kevin, never thought of that.

I'm not looking for a pity party here. I just... does anyone else feel like this? Like you're screaming into a void and everyone around you is having normal human experiences while you're just trying to figure out why everything feels so damn hard?

How do you even meet people who get it? Dating apps are a nightmare. Making friends as an adult feels impossible. And I'm tired of pretending I'm fine when cashiers ask how my day is going.

If you've felt this way and somehow figured it out, I could really use some hope right now. Even just knowing I'm not the only one would help.

Sorry for the rambling mess. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.",21,1753449965.0,getdisciplined,7,1.0,False
1m8z3ar,https://www.reddit.com/r/studyAbroad/comments/1m8z3ar/ultimate_2025_guide_top_countries_for_indian/,"""🌍 Ultimate 2025 Guide: Top Countries for Indian Students with Epic CVs - My simple formulae = (2+ Research Pubs, 10+ Extracurriculars, 5 community certis) to Land High-Paying Jobs Abroad! 💰😎""","**Best Countries for HighPaying Jobs for Indian Students with Superhero Profiles (2+ Research Pubs, 10+ Extracurriculars, 10+ Community Service)**

Your CV is basically a Bollywood blockbuster—research pubs, extracurricular certs, community service, and probably a hidden talent for juggling flaming torches! 🔥 With your stellar profile, you’re ready to conquer grad programs and highpaying jobs abroad. I’ve jazzed up this guide for 2025 with some humor to match your energy, comparing top countries (and the USA) for Indian students like you chasing big bucks, great education, and a chance to settle. Let’s dive into the global job market like it’s a danceoff! 💃

Top Countries for HighPaying Jobs

1. Canada Why It’s Great for You: Canada’s like that friendly neighbor who invites you over for chai and then offers you a job! 🇨🇦 Top unis like UofT or UBC will drool over your pubs, and scholarships like Vanier (CAD 50k/year, \~₹30L) are basically begging you to apply. The PostGraduation Work Permit (PGWP) lets you work up to 3 years postgrad, and Express Entry or Provincial Nominee Programs (PNP) make PR smoother than a Tim Hortons drivethru.

HighPaying Jobs: Data Scientist: CAD 85k–130k/year (\~₹51–78L). Toronto/Vancouver are hotter than your mom’s spicy biryani. AI/ML Engineer: CAD 90k–150k/year (\~₹54–90L). Think Shopify or RBC, not just maple syrup startups. Research Scientist: CAD 70k–120k/year (\~₹42–72L). DeepMind or unis, where you can nerd out in peace.

Compared to USA: Pros: Tuition’s cheaper (CAD 20k–40k vs. USD 30k–60k in USA); PR is easier than convincing your auntie you’re full; huge Indian diaspora for late night dosa runs. Work 20 hrs/week parttime during studies, fulltime during breaks—chaotic, but doable! Cons: Salaries are a tad lower than in the USA (US data scientists make USD 100k–150k, \~₹83–125L); winters so cold you’ll think your code’s frozen too; fewer tech giants than Silicon Valley. Visa Edge: Canada’s study permit is chill—work off campus without begging for approval, unlike USA’s F1. PGWP > OPT, because H1B is like playing visa roulette.

Why It Fits: Your pubs and certs make you an Express Entry rockstar, and Canada’s so welcoming you’ll feel like you’re at a family wedding (minus the awkward rishta talks).

2. Germany Why It’s Great for You: Free unis (TUM, Heidelberg) charge \~€200–400/semester, cheaper than your annual coffee budget! ☕ Your pubs scream “DAAD scholarship” (€1,200/month), and the 18month poststudy job search visa plus EU Blue Card make you the James Bond of STEM careers. 🕶️

HighPaying Jobs: Software Engineer: €60k–100k/year (\~₹53–88L). SAP, Siemens—basically, German engineering with a side of schnitzel. Research Scientist: €50k–90k/year (\~₹44–79L). Max Planck or Fraunhofer, where your pubs will have groupies. Data Scientist: €55k–95k/year (\~₹48–84L). Berlin/Munich, where startups are cooler than Oktoberfest.

Compared to USA: Pros: Free education (vs. USD 30k–60k/year in USA); living costs (\~₹8–10L/year) won’t make you cry like US rents (\~₹12–20L); EU Blue Card lets you flex across Europe. Some programs don’t even need IELTS—score! Cons: Salaries lower than USA; German language is like decoding a secret spy code for PR; fewer global finance/tech hubs than Silicon Valley. Visa Edge: 20 hrs/week parttime work, like the USA. Poststudy job search (18 months) is more flexible than OPT, and Blue Card is less drama than H1B.

Why It Fits: Your research vibes sync with Germany’s nerdy innovation scene, and your certs make scholarship apps pop like a Bollywood dance number.

3. Australia Why It’s Great for You: Unis like Melbourne or ANU will roll out the red carpet for your research and leadership, and Australia Awards (full tuition + living) are basically your Oscar. 🏆 The poststudy work visa (2–4 years) is like a gap year with a paycheck, and the Skilled Migration Program makes PR as achievable as mastering Vegemite toast.

HighPaying Jobs: Software Developer: AUD 80k–130k/year (\~₹48–78L). Atlassian, Canva—kangaroolevel cool. Data Analyst/Scientist: AUD 85k–140k/year (\~₹51–84L). Sydney/Melbourne, where the coffee’s as strong as your CV. Research Fellow: AUD 70k–120k/year (\~₹42–72L). Universities or CSIRO, where your pubs get VIP treatment.

Compared to USA: Pros: Longer poststudy visa (2–4 years vs. USA’s 12–36 months OPT); multicultural vibes like a global food festival; high quality of life (beaches, anyone?). Tuition (AUD 30k–50k) is often cheaper than USA. Cons: Salaries slightly lower than USA; Sydney’s living costs (\~₹10–12L/year) hit harder than a cricket ball; smaller research job market. Visa Edge: 20 hrs/week parttime work, like USA. Poststudy visa is less fussy than OPT, with clearer PR paths than H1B’s Hunger Games.

Why It Fits: Your certs add PR points, and your pubs make you a star in Australia’s tech scene. Plus, you’ll probably charm a koala or two.

4. United Kingdom Why It’s Great for You: Oxford or Imperial will see your pubs and certs and think, “Is this the next Nobel laureate?” 🧑‍🎓 Chevening scholarships (full funding) are your golden ticket, and the Graduate Route visa (2–3 years) lets you work in finance/tech/academia while sipping overpriced London coffee.

HighPaying Jobs: Investment Banking Analyst: £60k–100k/year (\~₹63–105L). Goldman Sachs, Barclays—fancy suits included. Data Scientist: £50k–90k/year (\~₹53–95L). London’s tech/finance scene is buzzing. Academic Researcher: £40k–80k/year (\~₹42–84L). Unis or institutes, where your pubs are basically royalty.

Compared to USA: Pros: 1year master’s programs save time and cash (vs. 2 years in USA); no H1B lottery nonsense; London’s finance/tech networks are posher than a royal tea party. Cons: Tuition (\~₹15–35L/year) is steeper than a doubledecker bus; London living costs (\~₹10–15L) make your wallet cry; PR tougher than cracking a British accent. Visa Edge: 20 hrs/week parttime work, like USA. Graduate Route is simpler than OPT but shorter than Canada/Australia’s chill vibes.

Why It Fits: Your research and leadership make you a UK superstar, ready to sip tea and code with the best.

5. Singapore Why It’s Great for You: NUS/NTU are like the Avengers of tech/business, and your pubs scream SINGA scholarship. 🦁 Employment Pass/S Pass are your keys to highpaying jobs in this financial/tech hub, where you’re closer to home than a quick flight to Mumbai.

HighPaying Jobs: AI/ML Engineer: SGD 80k–150k/year (\~₹50–93L). Grab, DBS Bank—futuristic vibes. Financial Analyst: SGD 70k–120k/year (\~₹43–75L). Banking sector, where money talks. Research Scientist: SGD 60k–110k/year (\~₹37–68L). Biotech/tech R&D, where your pubs shine.

Compared to USA: Pros: Tuition (SGD 20k–40k) is cheaper than USA (USD 30k–60k); salaries rival Silicon Valley; close enough for mom’s care packages; no H1B drama. Cons: Job market’s smaller than your LinkedIn network; PR is tougher than getting into an MRT at rush hour; living costs (\~₹10–15L) sting. Visa Edge: 16 hrs/week parttime work; poststudy job search is less structured than OPT but Employment Pass is smoother than a Singapore Sling.

Why It Fits: Your pubs and certs make you a scholarship magnet, and Singapore’s innovation scene loves a brainiac like you.

USA: The Benchmark Why It’s Great for You: The USA is the Hollywood of job markets—MIT, Stanford, and Silicon Valley are ready for your blockbuster CV. 🎬 Your pubs and certs score TA/RA gigs (USD 20k–30k/year stipends), and companies like Google or Amazon will fight over you like it’s Black Friday.

HighPaying Jobs: Software Engineer: USD 100k–150k/year (\~₹83–125L). Google, Amazon—chaotic but dreamy. Data Scientist: USD 90k–140k/year (\~₹75–116L). Tech/finance, where data is king. Research Scientist: USD 80k–130k/year (\~₹66–108L). Pfizer, NASA—your pubs are basically VIP passes.

Pros: Highest salaries globally; tech/finance hubs bigger than your ambitions; STEM OPT (24 months) for F1 holders; networking at elite schools is wild. Cons: Tuition (USD 30k–60k, \~₹25–50L) is pricier than a Bollywood wedding; living costs (\~₹12–20L) hit hard; H1B lottery is like trying to win at Uno with your cousins; PR is a distant dream. Visa: F1 allows 20 hrs/week on campus work, offcampus via CPT/OPT with approval. H1B is a wild card.

Which Country Should You Pick?

Canada: Go for affordability, PR ease, and a vibe so chill you’ll feel like you’re in a romcom. Your certs and pubs are PR gold. Germany: Free education and research galore—perfect if you don’t mind learning German and dodging Oktoberfest crowds.

USA: Chase the big bucks and global fame, but brace for visa drama etc (kidding… mostly).

Australia: Tech jobs, PR, and beaches—ideal if you want to code by day and surf by evening. Singapore: Tech/finance paradise close to home, but PR is trickier than getting your parents to approve a love marriage.

Pro Tips for Your Superhero Profile:

Leverage Your Pubs: Your 2+ publications are your Infinity Gauntlet—use them for scholarships like Vanier, DAAD, Chevening, or SINGA. Snap your way to funding! Use Your Certs: Your extracurriculars and community service are like extra lives in a video game—boost your scholarship and PR points (Canada/Australia love this). Network: Slide into LinkedIn DMs of alumni/professors like you’re pitching a startup on Shark Tank. Plan Early: Visa rules are tightening faster than your deadline stress—apply ASAP for unis and scholarships. Language: Learn basic German (for Germany) or polish your business English (UK/Singapore) to charm recruiters like a Bollywood hero.

Drop your field (STEM, finance, etc.) or dream job, and I’ll tailor this further. Where are you leaning—Team Canada or Team Silicon Valley? What’s your next move, superstar? 😎

I quit my office job a few months ago because I was dying inside. Now I'm freelancing as a designer, which is what I always wanted, but holy shit the isolation is brutal. Some days I don't talk to another human being except to order coffee.

The worst part is when I do try to open up to someone about feeling this way, their eyes kind of glaze over. Or they give me the whole ""have you tried going to the gym?"" speech. Like, thanks Kevin, never thought of that.

I'm not looking for a pity party here. I just... does anyone else feel like this? Like you're screaming into a void and everyone around you is having normal human experiences while you're just trying to figure out why everything feels so damn hard?

How do you even meet people who get it? Dating apps are a nightmare. Making friends as an adult feels impossible. And I'm tired of pretending I'm fine when cashiers ask how my day is going.

# Brother, You’re Not Broken (And This Pattern Has a Name)

If you’re reading this because something in that opening hit different, listen — [you’re not crazy, you’re not weak](https://app.coto.world/KeASMTp7hVb), and you sure as hell aren’t the only guy dealing with this.

**Here’s what nobody talks about:** I tried every **best mental health app** available — Headspace, Calm, BetterHelp, Talkspace — but none addressed the root issue. In the U.S., only 40% of men with mental illness get help compared to 52% of women. But it’s not because we’re naturally tougher. It’s because we’ve been taught that admitting we’re struggling makes us less of a man.

That’s complete garbage.

[**Why the top mental health apps failed me**](https://app.coto.world/KeASMTp7hVb)**:** Most **therapy apps** focus on symptom management — breathing exercises, mood tracking, guided meditation. But they don’t address why you’re addicted to chaos in the first place. There are more than 10,000 mental or behavioral health apps publicly available, yet there is little available information on their effectiveness for deep relationship patterns.

Cultural expectations around masculinity often discourage men from expressing vulnerability or seeking help, leading to silence, shame, and untreated psychological distress. From childhood, we hear “boys don’t cry,” “man up,” “handle your own problems.” So when our relationships become war zones and our **mental health** spirals, we try to muscle through it alone.

But here’s the truth they don’t want you to know: staying stuck in relationship patterns that destroy good women and sabotage your happiness isn’t strength — it’s fear dressed up as masculinity.

**Quick Check: Are You Stuck in Toxic Love Patterns?** □ Drama feels more “real” than peace in relationships  
□ You sabotage good relationships waiting for disaster  
□ Healthy love feels “boring” compared to emotional chaos  
□ You’d rather suffer alone than ask for **relationship advice**  
□ You keep attracting the same type of woman (the ones who hurt you)

If you checked even two boxes, you’re dealing with what relationship experts call “familiar pain addiction” — and traditional **mental health apps** won’t touch the root of this problem. Most **therapy apps** focus on surface-level coping strategies, but **what are the symptoms of depression** when it comes to toxic relationships? It’s not just sadness — it’s addiction to familiar chaos.

*Pause here: What would your life look like if you stopped equating emotional chaos with “real love”?*

# My Story: When a Software Engineer’s Logic Met Love Addiction

Name’s Marcus. 29, software engineer in Chicago. I debug systems for a living but couldn’t debug my own heart to save my life. For two years, I was trapped in an on-and-off nightmare with Sophia that nearly cost me the woman I actually wanted to build a life with.

Sophia was chaos [wrapped in chemistry](https://app.coto.world/KeASMTp7hVb). We’d fight like enemies, break up dramatically, then reconcile like we were starring in some tragic romance movie. I told myself this was “real love” — the kind you fight for, the kind that proves you’re actually alive.

The truth? I was addicted to the highs and lows because they felt familiar. Growing up watching my [parents’ volatile marriage](https://app.coto.world/KeASMTp7hVb), my nervous system learned that love equals conflict, that peace means someone’s about to leave.

Emma was everything I claimed I wanted — stable, consistent, emotionally available. We met at a climbing gym. She was patient when I was learning new routes, supportive without being clingy, confident without being dramatic.

But when she offered me the [**emotional wellness**](https://app.coto.world/KeASMTp7hVb) I said I craved, my system went haywire. Peace felt like a trap. I kept waiting for her to reveal hidden chaos that would make our relationship feel “real.”

Three months with Emma. Things were beautiful — too beautiful. Then Sophia texts at midnight: “I miss us, Marcus. We were magic together.” My heart pounds. Emma’s sleeping peacefully beside me, trusting me completely.

In that moment, I [realized something terrifying](https://app.coto.world/KeASMTp7hVb): I was more excited by Sophia’s midnight chaos than Emma’s morning coffee routine.

**How This Toxic Pattern Destroyed My Life:**

**Career Implosion:**

* [Missing deadlines](https://app.coto.world/KeASMTp7hVb) because I’d spend hours analyzing Sophia’s social media for “hidden signals”
* My manager Jake pulled me aside: “Your code’s solid, but you’re clearly distracted”
* Panic attacks [during stand-up meetings](https://app.coto.world/KeASMTp7hVb) when my phone buzzed
* Productivity crashed every time we were in “reconciliation mode”

**Family Destruction:**

* Lying to [my parents about why Sophia](https://app.coto.world/KeASMTp7hVb) kept disappearing from family events
* Snapping at my brother when he asked innocent questions about my “[mood swings](https://app.coto.world/KeASMTp7hVb)”
* Using family dinners to process relationship trauma instead of being present
* Mom started calling more often, worried about my “stress levels”

**Social Isolation:**

* Canceled basketball games because “what if she needs to talk?”
* Abandoned my [woodworking hobby](https://app.coto.world/KeASMTp7hVb) — every project reminded me of promises we made
* Friends stopped including me because I’d spend entire hangouts checking my phone
* Lost myself [completely outside of relationship](https://app.coto.world/KeASMTp7hVb) crisis management

**Physical Breakdown:**

* Chronic insomnia during “unclear status” phases
* Stress-induced stomach issues that required medical attention
* Constant tension headaches from overthinking every interaction
* Started drinking more to numb the anxiety

The worst part? I was unconsciously testing Emma’s patience, trying to create the drama I was addicted to. I was self-sabotaging the healthiest relationship I’d ever had because it didn’t match my trauma-conditioned definition of “love.”

**The Internal War Every Man Faces:**

Society programs us to be the provider, the protector, the one who never breaks. But what they don’t tell you is that emotional constipation isn’t strength — it’s just constipation. I thought asking for help made me weak. Actually, staying stuck in patterns that hurt good women? That’s what’s weak.

*Take a moment: What would change in your life if you stopped believing that struggle equals love?*

# How coto’s Live Tarot Reading Became My Alternative to Failed Mental Health Apps

After downloading every [**best mental health app**](https://app.coto.world/KeASMTp7hVb) available — Headspace, Calm, Sanvello, even premium **therapy apps** like BetterHelp — and getting surface-level coping strategies, I found coto during a 3 AM desperation search. Look, I was skeptical as hell. **How to find a life coach** through tarot cards? **Tarot reading** felt like something my sister did for entertainment, not something for a logical engineer dealing with real problems.

But I was desperate. Emma deserved better than my chaos, and I was about to lose her because I couldn’t stop gravitating toward familiar dysfunction. Unlike **mental health apps** that offer scheduled sessions or automated responses, coto offered **24/7 mental health support** through verified experts.

**My First Session with Rashmeet Changed Everything:**

Rashmeet wasn’t some crystal-gazing fortune teller. She was a **relationship coach** who used tarot cards as psychological tools. No mystical predictions about my future — just brutal honesty about why I kept choosing familiar pain over unfamiliar peace.

“Marcus,” she said, laying out The Devil card, “look at these figures in chains. But see this? The chains are loose. They can walk away anytime. You’re not trapped by Sophia — you’re trapped by your addiction to chaos.”

That hit like a sledgehammer. I wasn’t a victim of bad luck in love — I was an addict choosing drama over peace because it felt more “real.”

**What Made coto Different from Top Mental Health Apps:**

* **Real humans available instantly** during emotional crises (not scheduled therapy weeks away like traditional **therapy apps**)
* **No judgment about masculinity and spiritual seeking** — they normalized getting guidance as evolution
* **Integration of practical psychology with spiritual wisdom** — not just **stress management** breathing exercises and mood tracking like **wellness apps**
* **24/7 mental health support** when destructive impulses hit hardest
* **Tools for pattern recognition**, not just symptom management like most **mental health apps**

**Why This Worked When Best Mental Health Apps Failed:**

Most **therapy apps** treat symptoms, not causes. They offer **anxiety therapy** techniques and **depression support**, but they don’t address why you’re choosing chaos over peace. **Virtual coaching** through tarot provided something different — immediate insight into behavioral patterns that **mental health apps** miss.

**The Insight That Changed My Life:**

“The Seven of Cups shows a figure overwhelmed by illusions,” Rashmeet explained. “You’re not choosing between two women — you’re choosing between two versions of yourself. Sophia represents who you were. Emma represents who you’re becoming.”

For the first time, I understood: I wasn’t choosing between people — I was choosing between growth and familiar suffering.

*Reflect on this: If you knew your current relationship patterns would be identical five years from now, what would you change today?*

# The Practical Tools That Actually Worked (No Spiritual Fluff)

# Daily Tarot Guidance Protocol

**Morning Card Pull:** “What energy am I bringing to my relationship today?”  
**Evening Reality Check:** “Did I choose growth or familiar patterns today?”

# Crisis Management System

When Sophia would text or drama-addiction kicked in:

1. **Pull one card immediately**
2. **Ask: “Is this choice serving my highest good or feeding my addiction?”**
3. **Breathe, choose consciously, not reactively**

# The 6 Rituals That Broke My Destructive Patterns:

**1. Ho’oponopono Prayer + The Star Card:** *“I’m sorry for believing love should hurt. I forgive myself for choosing chaos over peace. Thank you for showing me I deserve gentle love.”*

**2. Cord Cutting + The Two of Swords:** White candles, visualize cutting toxic relationship cords: *“I call back my power from patterns that no longer serve me.”*

**3. Gemstone Work + The Empress:** Rose quartz meditation asking: *“What does healthy love feel like?”* Answer: Steady warmth, not lightning.

**4. White Spells + The High Priestess:** *“I call in wisdom to distinguish chemistry from compatibility, trauma bonds from healthy partnership.”*

**5. Candle Blessings + The Lovers:** Pink/green candles: *“I bless my journey toward conscious love. I release the need for chaos.”*

**6. Love Ritual + Two of Cups:** *“I call in partnership that supports growth and truth.”*

**The Breakthrough Moment:**

Rashmeet had me visualize my life five years from now:

* **Path 1:** Still cycling through chaos with Sophia, still anxious, still stuck
* **Path 2:** Building something real with Emma, growing together, at peace

**Which future required more courage?**

*Challenge yourself: What patterns are you ready to outgrow?*

# The Transformation: What Actually Changed in My Real Life

**Month 1:** Stopped responding to Sophia’s manipulation attempts  
**Month 2:** Started recognizing peace as safety, not boredom  
**Month 3:** Had completely honest conversation with Emma about my patterns  
**Month 6:** Felt genuinely calm in love for the first time in my adult life  
**Month 9:** Helped my buddy Alex recognize his own **toxic relationship patterns**

**Concrete Life Improvements:**

**Professional:** Promoted to lead developer with improved focus and decision-making **Family:** Actually present during gatherings, honest conversations with my dad **Personal:** Back to basketball and woodworking, sleep quality improved dramatically **Social:** Friends seek my advice because I seem more grounded

**Relationship Reality:** Emma and I are engaged. Not because we’re “soulmates,” but because I choose peace over chaos daily. Do I miss the intensity sometimes? Yeah. But I don’t mistake intensity for love anymore.

**5 Signs You’re Ready for Healthy Love:** ✓ You can sit with calm without creating crisis  
✓ Your partner’s consistency feels safe, not boring  
✓ You choose based on long-term compatibility, not short-term chemistry  
✓ Problems get solved through communication, not drama  
✓ You see seeking guidance as masculine evolution, not weakness

# It’s Time to Redefine Masculine Strength

**The strongest men aren’t the ones who never fall — they’re the ones who choose to get back up differently.**

Over the past 20 years, the number of men receiving **mental health support** has increased from 8.7% to 11.3%. We’re slowly realizing that the “tough it out alone” approach is literally killing us. Men died by suicide at a rate 3.54 times higher than women in 2017.

**What Actually Makes You Strong:**

* Recognizing destructive patterns and changing them
* Getting **relationship coaching** when DIY approaches fail
* Choosing growth over ego protection
* Building partnerships based on compatibility, not just chemistry

The guys who’ve done this work aren’t less masculine — they’re more evolved. They have stronger relationships, clearer minds, better careers.

**Why Tarot Guidance Is Growing Among Men:**

**Tarot relationship spreads** offer immediate insight without traditional therapy stigma. Unlike apps with generic advice, live **tarot reading** provides personalized guidance exactly when you need it.

The bottom line: Your patterns aren’t permanent. Your past doesn’t have to poison your future. Sometimes the most badass thing you can do is choose love that feels unfamiliar because it’s actually healthy.

# Ready to Break the Cycle? Your Next Move Starts Here

Stop managing symptoms. Start transforming the root patterns.

**The strongest choice you can make right now:** Connect with verified **relationship coaches** and **tarot reading** experts who understand that seeking spiritual guidance isn’t “unmanly” — it’s the next level of masculine evolution. Available **24/7** for immediate support when you need clarity most.

Unlike **best mental health apps** that offer scheduled sessions, **how to find a life coach** through tarot means instant access during crisis moments. Because your breakthrough doesn’t have to wait for Monday’s therapy appointment.

1m8yx25,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoLawns/comments/1m8yx25/an_economic_lawn/,An Economic Lawn,"The importance of a yard. How can your yard help lessen the climate catastrophe? As an upcoming author, I try to post my writing on various topics once a week. This week, I opted to educate my base on the importance of a native lawn. I live in Michigan 6a. 

Original Post: [https://mwupham.wixsite.com/upham-writes/post/an-economic-lawn](https://mwupham.wixsite.com/upham-writes/post/an-economic-lawn)

As a homeowner, I am currently in the process of killing all my grass to replace it with native flowers, plants, and crops to effectively utilize the space to create a sustainable environment. 

It’s important to consider what’s more important: a neat lawn or the survival of our environment? “More than 80 percent of the world’s flowering plants need a pollinator to reproduce; and we need pollinators too, since most of our food comes from flowering plants. One out of every three bites of our food, including fruits, vegetables, chocolate, coffee, nuts, and spices, is created with the help of pollinators” (Randall, 2020). This statement perfectly outlines the purpose of no-lawn culture. In dedicating our space to grass only, we are robbing wildlife of many plants and nutrients they need to survive. Though it might not seem like a detriment to humanity, the cost will have long-term effects that could make it extremely difficult for our species. This is even more apparent when you consider “Over 83% of land in the United States is privately owned. This means that every bit of care, whether on a small plot or a vast estate, plays a huge role in the fate of wildlife in this country” (Randall, 2020).

Bees are currently facing endangerment, and several species are nearly extinct. By using pesticides, pulling flowering weeds, and keeping the lawn short, humanity is effectively making their properties a “no life” zone for many species who are quickly running out of space. Why? For the aesthetic of having a well-manicured lawn? Unfortunately, like most climate change issues, humanity is failing to consider what happens after the bees go extinct due to our own negligence. “Honey bees alone pollinate 80 percent of all flowering plants, including more than 130 types of fruits and vegetables” (Randall, 2020). 

Similarly, did you know that fireflies are quickly approaching the endangered species list? “Fireflies are the latest insect to be considered endangered amid a so-called 'bug apocalypse’. It was reported earlier this year that monarch butterfly populations dipped 59% in their winter migration” (Dunbar, 2024). Why is that? The answer is quite simple with a few key questions: Where do fireflies lay their eggs in the fall? On fallen leaves, which humans are quick to get rid of. Part of the “no lawn” culture includes leaving the fallen leaves. Not only do fireflies lay their eggs on these leaves, but many insects, amphibians, and reptiles use the leaves to hibernate or keep warm until spring arrives. After May passes, the leaves become safe to remove. However, by removing them in the fall, we are effectively contributing to the extinction of several species that rely on them to survive. And honestly, what’s a few leaves left behind? By leaving them, you no longer have to rake, which reduces your yardwork. Not to mention, do we even use our yards in the winter? What is the actual purpose of raking our leaves besides keeping up with a pointless aesthetic? 

Many people involved in no-lawn culture limit the number of pesticides and fertilizers sprayed in their yards. If fertilizer is used, we try to keep it as natural as possible. “Pesticides and lawn chemicals are major limiting factors. Mosquito spraying kills nontarget insects, including fireflies. And homeowners douse their lawns with all manner of elixirs deadly to firefly larvae and their prey, both of which live in soil and leaf litter” (Williams, 2023). Furthermore, where do the pesticides go after they are sprayed? With every rain, they are carried down storm drains into lakes, rivers, and oceans. These pesticides hurt many plants and all animals that come into contact with them, even humans and children who may be swimming where pesticides currently reside. Furthermore, “Professor David Wolfe found that, for every ton of nitrogen created to make lawn fertilizer, four or five tons of carbon are added to the atmosphere” (Maceachern, 2022). 

In this day and age, with the climate crisis rising, every individual must take part in restoring the ecosystem wherever possible. This includes more than recycling and turning off lights when not in use. “Climate change will also trigger a catastrophic rise across several climate-sensitive disease outcomes, including vector-borne disease, which will likely impact previously less affected regions such as Europe and the United States. By 2050, an additional 500 million people may be at risk of exposure to vector-borne diseases” (World Economic Forum, 2024). So we must do whatever we can to aid against the climate crisis NOW, before it’s too late. 

I understand this lifestyle is not for everyone, and I’m not asking you to remove every spec of grass from your property. I acknowledge that children deserve a place to play, and I intend to have plenty of space for my potential future children in the backyard. However, we must consider our environment as much as we do ourselves in the age of the climate crisis, and I know that a biodiverse yard helps the climate more than keeping a standard yard. 

In conclusion, I plan to fill my property with beautiful native flowers and plants that will help support the biodiversity of species native to my area. “You can create a sanctuary by: eliminating outdoor lights or at least putting them on timers; reducing or eliminating pesticides and lawn chemicals; switching to natural fertilizers; planting native forbs, grasses, shrubs, and trees; keeping property moist by creating pools and water gardens; and, the easiest and most popular of all, resisting requests to mow grass and rake leaves” (Williams, 2023). 

If you’ve read this far, I want to give a warm thank you. I hope it’s clear how near and dear to my heart this issue is, and how vital it is that we protect our planet in ways we never thought possible. In reading my post, I request that you ask yourselves a few key questions. What do you hope to get out of your yard? Is your yard being regularly used? Would it be possible to give some of your yard back to the pollinators to assist the environment and fight the climate crisis? For ideas and inspiration on how to have a fun, beautiful, and climate-friendly yard, there are plenty of ideas on Pinterest and the internet that show just how decorative and lovely a no-lawn yard can be.

1m8ysfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAVoyager/comments/1m8ysfs/how_to_go_around_oahu_island/,How to go around Oahu island?,"Just got back from an incredible Circle Island Tour of Oahu and I need to share this experience. As someone who's explored Hawaii multiple times, I've finally found the perfect way to see everything Oahu has to offer in a single day.

I took the Circle Island Tour with Waimea Waterfall, and it was honestly the best decision I made during my stay. The 8-hour journey covers all the major spots around Oahu, and you don't have to worry about navigation or parking - which is a huge relief if you've ever tried driving in Hawaii.

The tour starts early (7 AM pickup from Waikiki), but it's worth getting up for. Our first stop was Diamond Head, where we got those postcard-perfect views of the coastline. The morning light made for amazing photos, and our guide shared fascinating stories about the volcanic crater's history.

One of the highlights was definitely Waimea Valley. The botanical garden is stunning, but the real gem is the waterfall. Pro tip: bring your swimsuit! The water is refreshing, and swimming under a Hawaiian waterfall is something you don't want to miss. 

The North Shore portion was fantastic - we stopped at famous beaches like Sunset Beach and had lunch at one of those legendary shrimp trucks. The garlic shrimp is a must-try, trust me.

What made this tour special was all the local insights our guide shared. We learned about Hawaiian culture, history, and got to try local treats like fresh macadamia nuts and Kona coffee at Tropical Farms. The Dole Plantation stop was perfect for grabbing that famous Dole Whip ice cream.

The best part? You can book it easily online and they offer free cancellation up to 24 hours before. After trying various ways to explore Oahu, this tour is definitely the most convenient and comprehensive option. You can check availability and book here: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island

Some practical advice:
- Bring cash for lunch and tips
- Wear comfortable shoes
- Pack a swimsuit and towel
- Bring a camera - the views are incredible
- Stay hydrated (they provide water)

The tour costs $154 per person, which is actually great value considering it includes entrance fees and transportation. They keep groups small (max 24 people), so you get a more personal experience.

If you're planning to explore Oahu and want to see all the major highlights in one day, this is your best bet. No rental car hassles, no getting lost, just a well-planned journey around the island with an expert guide.",1,1753449103.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

We met the same place my parents met 25 years back and when I first saw him I remember I pointed him out to my mom and saying look at that handsome guy with dimples I want him and I got him by chance and I feel like I fucked up . He was 5 years older to me and way more mature we were going to get engaged tomorrow but he broke it off last month because I told him I wanted a wedding next November and he told me a lot of other things he was done with with which I kept begging him to stay and I would change and fix them but he left 
He broke up over text in the afternoon and that morning he was so normal with the good morning text and I remember asking him that morning if he still likes me and he said yes and after the break up text when I called him crying he kept telling me he was done and I pleaded while losing my self respect . 

and in my eyes he was perfect , family was perfect and he was a true gentleman until the breakup hit and he got very mean all a sudden. He would make me wear my heels , make me coffee , cuddle me , everything under the sun but he was emotionally unavailable and after a point he was too busy to text or talk .

It’s been exactly one month from the break up and it’s not been easy . I’ve lost so much weight and sleepless nights , I keep thinking if I hadn’t brought up stuff he would have stayed . He went to Thailand and had his time while I cried my eyes out and when my parents reached out to his they were telling us how happy and stress free he is after the breakup and they never want to see me again . 
Yes I was immature and yes I had a few fuck ups but nothing that couldn’t be solved .
Ive never experienced this pain and it is not easy but im trying everyday hoping it gets better .

She sat across from me in the dimly lit restaurant, Niko’s. She chose this place, and it just so happened to be the restaurant that Mother always said she would want for a first date if she were ever to look for another fish in the sea. It seemed fitting now that I could sit in this restaurant on my first ever date. Brought here in some roundabout way by Mother.

Her voice didn’t do her justice when I spoke to her on the phone. She was beautiful. Her auburn hair fell in soft waves across her shoulders. She had just enough freckles speckled across her cheeks and the bridge of her nose to make it impossible to count. She wore a dress. I wouldn’t know how to describe it other than to say it was dark blue; she looked perfect in it, and Mother wouldn't have approved.

I had foolishly gotten my hopes up that this would be a real date, but she was far too gorgeous to be out with me. I knew the moment I saw her that she had probably suggested this meeting as a way to smooth things over with what had happened at the clinic. I’d be polite, like Mother had told me I should be on a first date. I’d pull her chair out for her, I’d give her the flowers I had brought, I’d pay for her meal, and if I had done everything correctly, I’d be allowed to walk her to her car and give her a hug. My hopes for the hug had walked out the door as this beautiful woman had walked in.

“I’m so sorry.”

“Again, it’s alright,” I said, as I slathered butter onto my slice of bread and shoved it into my mouth nervously.

“It’s just that he’s.” She paused while she searched her mind for the words. “He’s just such a fucking prick all the god damn time.”

I stopped chewing the massive bite and stared at her.

“Sorry, but it’s true. I fucking hate the man.”

I forced down the bite. “No, no, no. It’s ok.”

“It’s really not. I have to put up with him every day and he’s always such a sleazy piece of shit. There were all these rumors about him. Stuff about him getting caught in the dark with patient  X-rays. “Doing what?” I asked.

“You know.” She pantomimed stroking something with a closed fist.

I furrowed my brow. “I don’t know.”

She let out a massive laugh that turned into a contorted snort. Her sudden outburst startled both me and the others sitting near us. She covered her mouth with her hands, and her cheeks immediately blushed. “That’s funny. You’re funny, but nice try.”

An arm reached over her shoulder and placed a glass down in front of her. “A glass of Willamette’s pinot noir for the lady and for the gentleman.” The waiter gently bit his tongue as he set the glass down in front of me. “A glass of Welch’s grape juice. The food will be out shortly.” He turned on his heels and walked off into the sea of dimly lit tables.

“Anyways,” she said. “I probably shouldn’t be telling you any of this anyway, and it doesn’t even matter. He’s gone now.”

“Gone?” “Well, yeah. You don’t get to scream at a patient like he did and keep your job.”

“Oh, I feel awful. I didn’t want that.” I slouched back in my seat and took a sip of my juice.

“Don’t feel bad. It was going to happen sooner or later. You just happened to be the last straw for his career at the clinic.” She leaned forward and shot a wink across the table at me. “If anything, I should be saying thank you, but I think it’s best if we don’t even think about him tonight. After all, that’s not what we’re really here for.”

“No?”

“No.”

We looked at each other. Taking each other in. My heart began to beat faster.

“I’m sorry. What are we here for?”

She sat back in her chair and smiled. “I thought we’d get to know each other. Who are you? What makes you tick?”

My vision went hazy, and my ears felt hot as blood rushed through them. My heart was pounding as I began to share my life story. She was just so beautiful, I felt as if I was on the verge of blacking out while talking. My story isn’t particularly interesting, but by the time I finished, she was still listening. She seemed genuinely intrigued.

She looked across at me, stone-faced. “Wow. That was certainly a lot.”

“Yeah. It’s been a tough couple of months.”

She smiled. “I think you’re doing just fine.”

“I’m really sorry, but I have to be honest with you.”

“Yes, please do.”

“I don’t know what I’m doing.” I blurted. “I’ve never been on a.” I couldn’t bring myself to say it.

“A date?” She asked as a sly smirk crossed her lips.

“Yeah,” I said with a heavy sigh.

She reached her hand across the table and placed it on top of mine. “It’s ok, sweetie. I’ll help take care of you.”

The rest of the night was a blur. She introduced me to so many things that night, and it was an amazing evening of firsts for me. She ordered the food and more drinks. I had my first drink of wine. My head was a buzz as I learned about hummus and feta. I learned that there were all sorts of olives, and they were all more delicious than the last.  I learned that if you’re too loud, the bar will cut you off from drinks. I learned that a hug from a woman other than your mother gives the warmest feeling deep down in your soul. I learned about the softness of lips against your own. I learned about the smell of her shampoo and how the nape of her neck felt against my cheek. I learned how to unbutton a bra and about the peach fuzz on the small of her back. I learned about the weight of her bare breasts as they heaved against my chest. I learned that night what it meant to love.

Celeste moved in with me later that week. We were in love. She didn’t care that I still slept in my childhood room. She didn’t care that I had no prospects for a career. She didn’t care about the lump. She seemed to enjoy it. She would tell me often that I should just leave it. That it made me unique, and that she liked that I wasn’t anything like the other men she had been with. She’d often reach down and touch it as we made love, and that was fine by me. She had a voracious appetite for love-making. It had begun to affect our lives in negative ways. We had yet to unpack all of her belongings, so we lived among towering cardboard boxes of clothes, books, and knick-knacks she had brought with her. The house was starting to get dirty as well. Dishes were piling up in the sink, and grime was beginning to accumulate in the bathroom's crevices. The grass in the yard had started to grow unruly, and dirty clothes were piling up in every corner of every room. She took all of her vacation time to spend it at her new home with me, and it was clear what she intended to do, what she called “a staycation.” It had been 4 weeks now, and it was the most magical time of my life, but I was honestly exhausted, and the fact that I was such a light sleeper didn’t make the transition to sharing a bed any easier.

One night, I had to tell her that I just needed to sleep.

“I feel like a raisin.”

She reached down below the sheets, pulled my pajama shirt up with one hand, and thrust the other hand down below to take hold of me.

“I’m serious,” I said. “Not tonight. Please.”

“At least take off your pajamas.” She pleaded.

“No.”

She rolled her eyes. “Fine,” she mumbled as she turned away from me.

Although I couldn’t see her, I could feel how annoyed she was. Her warm body pressed up against mine, but the bed still felt cold. I don’t know how long she stewed in annoyance because the exhaustion took hold. I did not drift off to sleep as much as I plummeted into slumber.

“Wake up!” She whispered loudly into my ear.

My eyes shot open as her hot breath pierced into my ear canal.

“What? What is it?”

“Someone is trying to break in.”

I bolted upright, throwing back the covers. The late-night air was cold against my bare chest. I jumped up and ran to the window. There, below, I could see the form of a man sneaking around the house, peering into the windows. I grabbed the phone and called the police. The police arrived quickly. It couldn’t have been more than four or five minutes, but in that time, I saw the figure weakly attempt to pull open several windows and pick the lock in the door with no luck. The police arrived with flashing lights. They quickly jumped out of the car and began shouting at the figure. The lights silhouetted the figure more clearly, allowing me to see more details. It was now clear that whoever it was had a gun in one hand and a rope in the other. He was hunched over, old and frail.

“Holy shit,” Celeste said as she pressed her face up against the window. “That’s Dr. Richards down there.”

It was. Clear as day now in the sharp red and blue light spilling across my front yard. It was the same man who had screamed at me a month ago, bringing Celeste and me together.

“I have to get in!” He screamed at the police.

“Sir, that is not going to be happening tonight. You need to drop the gun!”

I couldn’t see all the details between the strobing lights and the awkward angle from which I was attempting to watch. Just a quick jerking movement from the doctor’s arm with the gun, and then a flurry of sparks and deafening bangs from the police. The doctor’s body was slumped against the doo,r and officers ran towards him shouting.

“Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit!” Celeste screamed.

“He’s going to be alright, right?”

“No, he’s not going to be alright! He’s fucking dead! They fucking shot him!”

“They’re going to want to talk to us, Celeste. Where’s my shirt? I need to find my shirt.”

The next day, Celeste went back to work. We did our best not to talk about what had happened that night, but it was hard not to think about it as we saw the blood-stained concrete in front of the door every day. As best as the police could make out, Dr. Richards was attempting to break in to enact revenge on me. It seemed that he was blaming me for losing his job at the clinic and had been planning on teaching me a lesson. We did our best to put it behind us.

Our love-making had come to a sudden crawl once Celeste had returned to work. I had just assumed it was due to the stress that comes with the hard work she did, but I didn’t really mind. I was glad to have the opportunity to rest and recharge, and Celeste still woke every morning with a smile on her beautiful face. Her work was a drain on her, though, and she’d return sullen. She began to seem distant to me. Her attitude had started to shift. I wasn’t sure if it was the incident with the doctor or the return to work. It could have been all of it. I had a new purpose in life now. I only wanted to make Celeste happy. While she was away, I cleaned and took care of the home. I prepared her meals and made sure she was as comfortable as possible. Nothing seemed to work, though. She’d often snap at me.

“God, you’re fucking pathetic. You know that, right?” She said one day, when I surprised her with flowers one day as she walked through the door.

She apologized later that evening as she mixed our nightly drink. A tradition she had started that I wasn’t particularly fond of, but it had become the only time now that she would sit and chat with me and be kind. The only time we had together anymore that reminded me of our first night together at that Greek restaurant. Every night was a different drink, and she’d refer to herself as a “mixologist”. We’d sit and sip our drinks and chat. I rarely, if ever, enjoyed the drinks, but I learned quickly that she took great offense if I didn’t finish them. We’d go to bed afterwards, where we no longer made love. The bed was only a place for sleeping now.

She had gotten into some sort of trouble at the clinic and was placed on a work program. This meant that she had to start working the late-night shift. We became like ships passing in the night. I’d wake in the morning with the sun and work around the house quietly while she slept. She’d wake as the sun went down and get ready for work. The tradition of our daily drinks did not end. She still insisted on fixing one for me each night before she left. I was just thankful that the few hours that we spent with each other included a brief time of comfort and conversation. I’d have my drink and crawl into bed, and she would leave for work. We carried on like this for months.

I woke one morning to a dull ache in my lump. I looked down to find that it had grown. The skin was blistered and red. I reached down to touch it, and the skin was hot and firm. I pulled myself from bed and fought off the pain with some ibuprofen. When Celeste woke up that evening, I asked her to take a look.

“I think you must have just slept on it wrong. Or didn’t you say you had switched the laundry detergent? It looks to me like an allergic reaction.”

“Allergic? To the detergent?” I asked.

“It’s super common. Don’t worry about it.” She said as she got dressed for her day.

But the pain didn’t subside. Every morning, the lump grew. Bit by bit, it grew until it was the size of a basketball protruding from my side. One morning, when I woke up, there was a small tear in my skin on the lump. Small splotches of blood had stained the sheets.

“You’re perfectly fine.” She’d assured me. “I even asked some of the doctors at the clinic about your situation, and they all agree that this is just a general flare-up. It’ll happen from time to time.”

“How can they know what it is? They haven’t even seen it.” I stammered.

“We have your files at the clinic. They’ve all seen that.”

“But it’s so much bigger now!”

“I know. They know that, too. I’ve shown them the pictures.”

My eyebrows shot up. “Pictures? What pictures?”

“The pictures I took.” She said with a tinge of annoyance.

“What are you talking about, Celeste?”

“I took a couple of photos of your lump when you were asleep. Don’t make a big deal about it.” She said with a scowl. “Celeste, why would you take pictures of it when I’m asleep?”

“This! This right here! This is why!” She snapped. “You’re such a god damn baby about everything. You spent so long moping around the house after Dr. Richards bled out on our front porch.” “That was a traumatic event!” I snapped back.

“You don’t do well with stress, Colin! Maybe it’s because you grew up as such a mama’s boy! I don’t fucking know!” She screamed at me. She took a deep breath and grabbed my shoulders. “You’re soft, Colin. It’s part of why I love you, but it means you don’t handle discomfort well. I know you feel shame around your lump. You shouldn’t feel shame about it, but you do. Am I right?”

I looked down at the floor. I was almost six inches taller than her, but in this moment, I felt so small. “Yeah.”

“You sleep like a rock. It takes an act of god to wake you up when you’re dead asleep. I just figured I’d save you from some embarrassment by taking some quick pictures while you slept. It’s not a big deal.” “You could have asked,” I said sheepishly.

“Colin, you would have been so fucking embarrassed and you know it. I’m only telling you about all of this now because you forced my hand. You know I love you, right?” She slipped her hand up to my chin and lifted my face to meet her gaze.

I nodded as I felt a sinking feeling in my gut. I felt sick to my stomach. This was all too much to take in. I felt violated and betrayed by someone I loved. Was this love? Was this what it meant to be loved? She fixed me a drink as usual. Tonight’s events were swimming through my mind as I was handed a drink. Something to do with a russian donkey. She talked to me as I sipped on my drink. I tried to listen. I nodded my head as if I was listening, but I couldn’t. My stomach churned over and over. I did my best not to let on how truly sick I felt. I knocked back the last of my drink in one swift motion.

“I have to use the restroom.” I blurted as I stood up and walked away.

“Ok. Go get 'em, Lump,” she said as I made my way down the hallway.

I stumbled into the bathroom and quickly shut and locked the door behind me. I promptly fell to my knees and grabbed onto the sides of the toilet. My back arched as I evacuated my insides in a violent blast. It stank of the drink I had just forced down. I immediately felt better. I stood to my feet and wiped the vomit from the corners of my mouth. I flushed the toilet and watched as the vile concoction spiralled down.

I walked back to the living room to find Celeste lounging on the couch, flipping through stations on the TV.

“You have such a small bladder.” She said with a chuckle. She turned her head back and caught a glimpse of me. She bolted upright. “Are you ok?”

“I’m fine.”

“You’re looking pale.”

“I’m just tired.” I lied. I couldn’t bring myself to tell her I couldn’t keep her drink down or that I was upset with her. Even though I didn’t trust her, she was so beautiful. I didn’t want to cause her any sort of pain, and I definitely didn’t want to say anything that would lead to another argument.

“Are you feeling nauseous or anything?” She asked with what seemed like genuine concern.

“No, no. I just had a big day today with cleaning, and I think I didn’t sleep great last night. No big deal. It’s bedtime anyway, so I’m just gonna go to bed.”

“Get some good rest,” she said after me as I made my way to the bedroom.

My head hit the pillow, and I drifted off to sleep. I had the most vivid nightmares of my life that night. I dreamt that there was a beautiful woman with a beautiful voice in love with an attractive man with an ugly voice. They had a long and loving conversation for what seemed like hours. All in soft whispers.

“They can’t keep us apart, my love.”

“Come to me.” The voice gurgled.

“He’s too stupid to know of our love.”

“Tell me you love me.”

“I love you, I love you, I love you.”

“Kill him,” it hissed.

“You know we can’t do that.”

“Take me away”

“You know that’s not an option either, my love.”

“Take me away!” It growled

The voice was horrible. I knew this dream was a nightmare, and I attempted to will myself awake to stop the horrendous voice from speaking. I blinked my eyes open ever so slightly. There in the pale light, I could see Celeste, nude and kneeling down by the bed. She was gently caressing my lump and whispering to it too faintly for me to make sense of the words parting between her lips. I dared not move and lay as still as possible and pretended to sleep. I didn’t know who this woman was, but it was not the Celeste I had fallen in love with back at Niko’s. She stayed there by my side until the sun rose. She looked back over her shoulder towards the rising light and stood up. She dressed in her nurse scrubs and left.

I lay there trying to make sense of the hellish night I had just experienced. Mother had given me bits and pieces of what it was like to have a partner, but she had certainly never described something like this.

I crawled out of bed and made my way downstairs. I could hear Celeste in the kitchen moving dishes around. I walked in to find her making eggs.

I cleared my throat as I took a seat at the kitchen table. “Celeste, last night.”

“Ugh, I can’t right now, Colin. I had a long day at work, so whatever hypochondriac issue you have cooking in that brain of yours is just going to have to go on the back burner.”

“Rough day at work?” I asked, perplexed.

“Yes, Colin. Not all of us got a ton of money from our dead mom. Some of us have to work for a living.”

“Celeste.”

She slammed her wooden spoon down on the counter. “For fuck’s sake, Colin. I have been at work all night dealing with annoying patients faking illnesses for painkillers and creepy doctors staring at my ass all night! I just got home! I just want to eat and go the fuck to bed! Is that too much to fucking ask for? Can you just shut the fuck up for a few fucking minutes and let me have some peace and god damn quiet?” She went back to stirring her eggs with the wooden spoon. I wouldn’t speak another word. I stayed sitting at the table. She finished cooking her eggs and ate them in complete silence. She tossed her fork down onto the empty plate and went to bed. I sat there at the table for hours. I finally stood and went to clean the dried eggs off her plate and pan. As I stood there focusing on the warm water running across my hands, I tried to make sense of how Celeste spent all night whispering to my lump. Why was she lying about being at work all night? I looked up to see the liquor cabinet on the other end of the kitchen beckoning me to open it. Beckoning me to peer inside for the first time since Celeste had claimed it for herself. I dried my hands and flung the doors open. Dozens and dozens of bottles lined the shelves. Brown, green, clear, and yellow. I would have thought it looked pretty if I didn’t already know how vile they tasted. I pulled the bottles out one by one to take a look at what they all were. I smelled each one in turn. Tequila, vodka, vermouth. Gin especially smelled foul. Then I came across a bottle I recognized. A small, plastic, orange bottle with a white cap. A child safety cap. It was my medicine. The medicine that Dr. Richards had given me was but the prescription date was after I had stopped taking the drug. I picked up the bottle to take a closer look, and there, behind that bottle, was another. Behind that bottle was another. I found six bottles in total. Each was jammed with the pills. Enough that had I continued to take them daily, I’d have enough for well over a year. Behind the bottles were two other troubling items. One was a bottle of some sort of medical liquid called Midazolam. The other was a booklet of prescription papers that had previously belonged to Dr. Richards.

I didn’t understand. She said I was perfect the way I was. Why was she giving me the medicine that had been making my lump grow? Why did she have so much of it? So much that she had a prescription pad to order more. What was Midazolam?

I picked up my phone and dialed the Wellspring Clinic.

“Thank you for calling the Wellspring Clinic. Can you please give me your name and date of birth?” Said a raspy-voiced woman on the other end. Her voice rattled with the sound of a lifetime of cigarettes.

“Hi, I’m Colin. I’m not a current patient. I just have a quick question I’m hoping you can help me out with.”

“Sure, Colin, go ahead,” said the smoky voice.

“My girlfriend actually works there. Well, she’s been.”

“Oh! A boyfriend is calling.” She exclaimed. Then with a hushed tone, “Are you planning a surprise? Who is the lucky girl?”

“Uh. Celeste, but what I wanted to ask is.”

“No, I don’t think so,” she interrupted. “Celeste doesn’t work here.”

“What do you mean she doesn't work there? Maybe you just don’t know her.”

“No. I’ve been here for twenty-two years this last Tuesday. I know everyone who works here, and there aren’t that many people to keep track of. It sounds like there is some confusion on your end, and I’m really sorry to have to be the one to break it to you. Celeste really should have been the one to tell you, but I can’t say I’m too surprised. She hasn’t worked here for two months now. She walked out and made a big stink about it. Threw brochures and papers all over the place. Real big mess to clean up.”

“That doesn’t make sense. She’s been going into work every night.”

“Honey, I don’t know where she’s been going every night, but it certainly isn’t the Wellspring Clinic.”

“I don’t understand.”

“Sometimes life throws you a curveball, honey. She’s a looker, and she was a talented nurse, but something in her snapped. She just wasn’t the same there at the end. Hope things get sorted out for you. You take care now, honey.” And with that, the phone went dead.

I was stunned. On the blindside of information slamming into me, I had completely forgotten to ask about the Midazolam.

“What’s going on, my love Lump?”

I spun around on my heels. There stood Celeste in her nightgown. The satin fabric spilled across her breasts, barely containing her as she rubbed the sleep from her eyes.

“What time is it?” She asked through a massive yawn.

The clock on the oven showed 2:33. I had completely lost track of time, getting lost in my thoughts. This was much earlier than she usually woke up, though.

“It’s really early. Why are you up?” I managed to ask through a guilty gulp.

“I just heard you talking to someone.” She walked to a cupboard and started to make some coffee. “Phone?”

“Yeah. Just a wrong number.”

“Sounded like a long phone call for a wrong number.”

“Some pushy salesman calling the wrong number. Couldn’t take no for an answer is all.” I said, staring down into the sink at the rest of the dishes I needed to finish up.

She stood very still for a moment before letting out another big yawn. “Ok,” she squeaked. “I hate those fuckers.” She began to pour the grounds into the top of the coffee maker. “Why don’t you go have a seat in the living room, Lump. I’ll fix my coffee up and I’ll bring you your nightly drink. I think you’ll like the surprise I’ve got lined up for you tonight.”

“Don’t you want to go back to sleep? It’s still so early for you.”

“What’s the point. I won’t be able to get back to sleep anyway, and we can hang out for a couple of extra hours. Go, have a seat, and relax. I’ll take care of mommy’s itty bitty boy.” She gently pushed me out of the kitchen and into the living room. “Sit, sit, sit.”

I plopped down onto the sofa. What in the world was going on? I reached down to hold my swollen lump, still the size of a basketball. What was her obsession, and what exactly was she putting in my drinks? She soon emerged from the kitchen with her coffee in one hand and a tall glass of brown liquid in the other.

“Thought we’d just go for an easy classic for you tonight.” She shoved the drink into my hand. “Whiskey on the rocks.”

She sat down across from me and leaned in close. She reached up and ran her fingers through my hair. “Drink up.”

I brought the drink slowly up to my lips and began to take a sip. She lifted her hand up to the bottom of the glass and tilted it back. The whiskey and whatever else was in there flooded into my mouth. I swallowed it down with a few gulps, and it burned the back of my throat and nose. This was by far the worst-tasting drink she had given me, but I had managed to drink it down.

“Good boy.” She patted me on the head and took my glass. “I’m going to make breakfast real quick. You just lie here and relax. She made her way to the kitchen while looking back over her exposed shoulder at me with a smile. “I’ll be right back.”

As soon as she left the view of the living room, I jumped to my feet and ran down the hallway to the bathroom. I assumed my position at the toilet and let loose a violent torrent of brown fire and mystery medicine. I hadn’t eaten all day, so the contents of my stomach were almost empty save for the drink and bile. I flushed it down and ran back to the couch Celeste had left me at while wiping the corners of my mouth free of vomit for a second night in a row. I plopped down and did my best to appear comfortable. A moment later, Celeste came back in with a slice of toast and her coffee. She sat down across from me once again.

“Wanna watch the bachelor?”

I nodded my head. “Sure.”

I couldn’t tell you what happened on the bachelor. Even when I wasn’t in fear for my life I couldn’t stand the show. I only sat through it because Celeste loved it so much. I found every person on the show absolutely horrible, but she thought the show was hilarious. We made it through the episode when she looked over at me and furrowed her eyebrows.

“Aren’t you tired?”

This was it. She was expecting me to be tired from the drink. I had to play along in order to try to piece together the puzzle of how she was spending her nights. I put my arms up high over my head and faked a yawn. “Oh, I am bushed,” I said as I started rubbing my eyes. I really needed to sell the idea that I was tired. “I think I’ll go get in bed early tonight.”

“Sounds good, Lump. Sweet dreams.”

I brushed the vomit and whiskey out of my teeth and crawled into bed. Truthfully, I was tired. Whatever she had given me was making me feel drowsy even after having put most of it down into the sewers below. My eyelids grew heavy as I lay still beneath the warm, soft sheets. I couldn’t lie there much longer pretending to be asleep before I actually fell asleep. The world grew dark and distant as I drifted off.

I dreamt again that night. More whispering between two beautiful lovers. One with the voice of an angel and the other with the sounds of an injured animal that had learned to talk.

“Did you bring it?” said the pained voice

“I bring it every night, love.”

“It’s time.”

“I can’t. I just can’t.

“Just do it already.” It snarled gt I felt a pinch. I peeled my eyelids apart to find, once again, Celeste nude and kneeling next to the bed. Rubbing my lump and whispering frantically. I watched her for a few minutes. If this were anything like the night before, she would continue on for hours and hours before ending her bizarre pastime. “Celeste?” I asked weakly through dry lips that stuck together as I said her name.

Her whispering stopped immediately, and she slowly turned her head to look at me.

“Celeste?” I licked my lips to moisten them. “What are you doing?”

She moved her hands down as if to hide them and continued to stare at me.

“Celeste. I called your work today. I know you’re no longer working at the clinic. I know you’ve been spending the nights coming in here and talking to yourself. I don’t know what’s going on, but I am deeply worried about you.”

Nothing. It was as though there was nothing there. She stared back at me with the eyes of an empty person.

“What are you hiding, Celeste?

Her gaze finally broke away from mine, and a look of shame spread across her face like wildfire. She handed me a small syringe.

“Celeste. What is going on?” I whispered to her.

With that, her nose crinkled and tears welled up in her eyes. She began weeping and placed her head down on my chest. My face was covered with her hair.

I put my hand onto her head and gently caressed her hair. “Tell me what’s wrong, Celeste. We can fix this. We can make things like they were once. We can get you help.”

I felt wet. A warm wetness. At first, I thought it was her tears cascading down me, but it was so much. It was all over me. I reached my hand down out of sight to touch the wetness and brought it back up to see. My fingers were drenched in red. I grabbed Celeste by the shoulder and sat her up along with me. The sheets were covered in blood, I was covered in blood, and Celeste was covered in blood. There in Celeste’s hand was a scalpel. “Celeste! No! Why? Please don’t do this. You have so much to live for! I love you!” I screamed. I grabbed the scalpel to rip it away from her. In doing so, I sliced deep into my left hand, but I had managed to throw the instrument across the room. I didn’t care about my hand. I could fix that later, but for now, I needed to find where she had cut herself. I grabbed her arms to see where she had made the slices. It was difficult to maneuver my hand with the deep gash. I must have sliced through some tendons, but I had enough dexterity to lift her arms up and find nothing.

“Where did you cut yourself, Celeste! Please tell me!” I grabbed her head and started moving it around to see if she had cut her throat. Once again, nothing. All I could see was a perfectly healthy, beautiful woman covered in blood and weeping. I looked down, and that was when I saw it. I was the source of blood. A gash running across the lump had exposed the yellow and white of the fatty tissue beneath the skin. It ran the entire length of the lump, and it was clear that the growth was beginning to make its way out.

“Celeste! Why? Why did you do this?” I screamed. I took both my hands and, to the best of my ability, I attempted to hold the wound closed. Blood seeped from between the two flaps of skin. The wound looked awful, but I could barely feel it. Other than the wetness and warmth of the blood, there was almost no feeling at all. “We were supposed to be together.” Said Celeste as she plunged her hands between the folds of skin I was holding together. No pain, but an overwhelming sense of pressure swelled up within me. I could feel a tugging at my innards. I let go with one hand and punched her square in the nose. It broke with a deafening crack as she fell backwards. Her hands, along with some of my intestines, spilled out of me. I grabbed them as quickly as I could and frantically started to shove them back inside.

Celeste leaped to her feet and lunged at me. I threw up my arms and managed to throw her down to the floor again. This short victory came at the cost of the intestines slipping out once more. This time, they plopped down onto the floor with a sickening, wet thud. I stood up, and the intestines spilled out more. I grabbed at them and tried to shove them back in with limited success. Celeste screamed incoherently. Her naked body writhed in the wetness, and her hair was a tangled, matted mess. Her eyes darted across the room to the scalpel on the floor. We both made a mad dash to be the first to get to it. There, our bodies entangled in a slippery mess on the floor. I held her face back with my limp hand. She bit into it deeply. I screamed out in pain, but I had a firm grip of the scalpel with the other hand. As she bit deeper and deeper into me, I swung the end of the blade upward into her throat. I swung the blade hard and deep over and over and over again. I kept swinging it after her body went limp and fell lifeless beside me.

Panting, I stumbled to my feet and grabbed at my side in an attempt to hold the wound closed. It was clear that I needed to stop the bleeding as soon as I could. I grabbed a towel and held it tightly to the cut. I made my way over to the mirror to see what Celeste had done to me. There it was. A clean cut about a foot long going vertically down my side. At the bottom were my intestines hanging out and dragging on the floor behind me. I moved the towel to the side a bit more to get a better look at the cut. As the folds of skin separated, I could make out a pair of milky eyes. They blinked.

I slowly peeled back the folds of skin and could make out more of a face. It was disgusting by any measure. Instead of a nose, it had only two shriveled holes. It’s lips were pulled back so far that they were barely there, and behind them were it’s gums holding onto tiny, chiclets of teeth. It had strands of hair falling across it’s brow in a wet mess, and it’s skin was mottled with vibrant reds, yellows, and sickening greys. It gasped for breath as if it had never tasted air before. With every breath it gulped down, I could feel my own lungs fill with a foul stench.

I couldn’t breathe. I had so many questions. Had this been in the entire time? Was this what Celeste wanted? What was I looking at? Most importantly, why was it so beautiful? Something about this thing was drawing me in. It called to me. I knew now what Mother meant when she talked about love at first sight. I knew the kind of love she described to me in fairy tales. I thought what I had felt for Celeste was love, but that paled in comparison to this.

I pulled back at my skin and pushed from within to reveal as much as I could. There in my childhood bedroom, I held the face of my beloved. It’s face would be the last thing I would see before I drifted off to sleep one last time. Although Celeste had brought my life to an end, she had taught me that in the end, I could truly learn to love myself.",2,1753448996.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

this week we had the oregano steaks & panzanella and i remember that it's always a banger, the panzanella is great. we've ordered it every time it's on the menu.

but they didn't include vinegar or olives as ingredients as they did in the past, which i thought was odd, because most cold salads need a vinegar component.

i thought maybe i was going crazy so i compared the current recipe card with an old one online that i'd ordered in the past.

and lo & behold, the old recipe had sherry vinegar and kalamata olives.

vinegar isn't expensive, neither are olives - why exclude them from the recipe?

and like, you actually \*need\* some vinegar in the salad, it adds this lovely acidic/sweet element and is much needed with the olive oil and mayo. olives are a delightful little treat and add lots of flavor.

i feel like Blue Apron is deliberately eliminating ingredients - some of them key! - in order to save themselves money but they're raising the prices on customers. you can go back and compare current recipes to old ones, and it's honestly appalling. they're leaving out stupid little things too, like onions and olives, or vinegar and spice packets. and they never give you enough cheese.

what gives, Blue Apron? i was born at night but not last night. gimme a break here.

anyway, thanks for tolerating another whiny post ... i swear i'm a very positive person in real life and maybe i'll feel better after i house this donut + coffee.",5,1753448996.0,blueapron,3,1.0,False

She sat across from me in the dimly lit restaurant, Niko’s. She chose this place, and it just so happened to be the restaurant that Mother always said she would want for a first date if she were ever to look for another fish in the sea. It seemed fitting now that I could sit in this restaurant on my first ever date. Brought here in some roundabout way by Mother.

Her voice didn’t do her justice when I spoke to her on the phone. She was beautiful. Her auburn hair fell in soft waves across her shoulders. She had just enough freckles speckled across her cheeks and the bridge of her nose to make it impossible to count. She wore a dress. I wouldn’t know how to describe it other than to say it was dark blue; she looked perfect in it, and Mother wouldn't have approved.

I had foolishly gotten my hopes up that this would be a real date, but she was far too gorgeous to be out with me. I knew the moment I saw her that she had probably suggested this meeting as a way to smooth things over with what had happened at the clinic. I’d be polite, like Mother had told me I should be on a first date. I’d pull her chair out for her, I’d give her the flowers I had brought, I’d pay for her meal, and if I had done everything correctly, I’d be allowed to walk her to her car and give her a hug. My hopes for the hug had walked out the door as this beautiful woman had walked in.

“I’m so sorry.”

“Again, it’s alright,” I said, as I slathered butter onto my slice of bread and shoved it into my mouth nervously.

“It’s just that he’s.” She paused while she searched her mind for the words. “He’s just such a fucking prick all the god damn time.”

I stopped chewing the massive bite and stared at her.

“Sorry, but it’s true. I fucking hate the man.”

I forced down the bite. “No, no, no. It’s ok.”

“It’s really not. I have to put up with him every day and he’s always such a sleazy piece of shit. There were all these rumors about him. Stuff about him getting caught in the dark with patient  X-rays. “Doing what?” I asked.

“You know.” She pantomimed stroking something with a closed fist.

I furrowed my brow. “I don’t know.”

She let out a massive laugh that turned into a contorted snort. Her sudden outburst startled both me and the others sitting near us. She covered her mouth with her hands, and her cheeks immediately blushed. “That’s funny. You’re funny, but nice try.”

An arm reached over her shoulder and placed a glass down in front of her. “A glass of Willamette’s pinot noir for the lady and for the gentleman.” The waiter gently bit his tongue as he set the glass down in front of me. “A glass of Welch’s grape juice. The food will be out shortly.” He turned on his heels and walked off into the sea of dimly lit tables.

“Anyways,” she said. “I probably shouldn’t be telling you any of this anyway, and it doesn’t even matter. He’s gone now.”

“Gone?” “Well, yeah. You don’t get to scream at a patient like he did and keep your job.”

“Oh, I feel awful. I didn’t want that.” I slouched back in my seat and took a sip of my juice.

“Don’t feel bad. It was going to happen sooner or later. You just happened to be the last straw for his career at the clinic.” She leaned forward and shot a wink across the table at me. “If anything, I should be saying thank you, but I think it’s best if we don’t even think about him tonight. After all, that’s not what we’re really here for.”

“No?”

“No.”

We looked at each other. Taking each other in. My heart began to beat faster.

“I’m sorry. What are we here for?”

She sat back in her chair and smiled. “I thought we’d get to know each other. Who are you? What makes you tick?”

My vision went hazy, and my ears felt hot as blood rushed through them. My heart was pounding as I began to share my life story. She was just so beautiful, I felt as if I was on the verge of blacking out while talking. My story isn’t particularly interesting, but by the time I finished, she was still listening. She seemed genuinely intrigued.

She looked across at me, stone-faced. “Wow. That was certainly a lot.”

“Yeah. It’s been a tough couple of months.”

She smiled. “I think you’re doing just fine.”

“I’m really sorry, but I have to be honest with you.”

“Yes, please do.”

“I don’t know what I’m doing.” I blurted. “I’ve never been on a.” I couldn’t bring myself to say it.

“A date?” She asked as a sly smirk crossed her lips.

“Yeah,” I said with a heavy sigh.

She reached her hand across the table and placed it on top of mine. “It’s ok, sweetie. I’ll help take care of you.”

The rest of the night was a blur. She introduced me to so many things that night, and it was an amazing evening of firsts for me. She ordered the food and more drinks. I had my first drink of wine. My head was a buzz as I learned about hummus and feta. I learned that there were all sorts of olives, and they were all more delicious than the last.  I learned that if you’re too loud, the bar will cut you off from drinks. I learned that a hug from a woman other than your mother gives the warmest feeling deep down in your soul. I learned about the softness of lips against your own. I learned about the smell of her shampoo and how the nape of her neck felt against my cheek. I learned how to unbutton a bra and about the peach fuzz on the small of her back. I learned about the weight of her bare breasts as they heaved against my chest. I learned that night what it meant to love.

Celeste moved in with me later that week. We were in love. She didn’t care that I still slept in my childhood room. She didn’t care that I had no prospects for a career. She didn’t care about the lump. She seemed to enjoy it. She would tell me often that I should just leave it. That it made me unique, and that she liked that I wasn’t anything like the other men she had been with. She’d often reach down and touch it as we made love, and that was fine by me. She had a voracious appetite for love-making. It had begun to affect our lives in negative ways. We had yet to unpack all of her belongings, so we lived among towering cardboard boxes of clothes, books, and knick-knacks she had brought with her. The house was starting to get dirty as well. Dishes were piling up in the sink, and grime was beginning to accumulate in the bathroom's crevices. The grass in the yard had started to grow unruly, and dirty clothes were piling up in every corner of every room. She took all of her vacation time to spend it at her new home with me, and it was clear what she intended to do, what she called “a staycation.” It had been 4 weeks now, and it was the most magical time of my life, but I was honestly exhausted, and the fact that I was such a light sleeper didn’t make the transition to sharing a bed any easier.

One night, I had to tell her that I just needed to sleep.

“I feel like a raisin.”

She reached down below the sheets, pulled my pajama shirt up with one hand, and thrust the other hand down below to take hold of me.

“I’m serious,” I said. “Not tonight. Please.”

“At least take off your pajamas.” She pleaded.

“No.”

She rolled her eyes. “Fine,” she mumbled as she turned away from me.

Although I couldn’t see her, I could feel how annoyed she was. Her warm body pressed up against mine, but the bed still felt cold. I don’t know how long she stewed in annoyance because the exhaustion took hold. I did not drift off to sleep as much as I plummeted into slumber.

“Wake up!” She whispered loudly into my ear.

My eyes shot open as her hot breath pierced into my ear canal.

“What? What is it?”

“Someone is trying to break in.”

I bolted upright, throwing back the covers. The late-night air was cold against my bare chest. I jumped up and ran to the window. There, below, I could see the form of a man sneaking around the house, peering into the windows. I grabbed the phone and called the police. The police arrived quickly. It couldn’t have been more than four or five minutes, but in that time, I saw the figure weakly attempt to pull open several windows and pick the lock in the door with no luck. The police arrived with flashing lights. They quickly jumped out of the car and began shouting at the figure. The lights silhouetted the figure more clearly, allowing me to see more details. It was now clear that whoever it was had a gun in one hand and a rope in the other. He was hunched over, old and frail.

“Holy shit,” Celeste said as she pressed her face up against the window. “That’s Dr. Richards down there.”

It was. Clear as day now in the sharp red and blue light spilling across my front yard. It was the same man who had screamed at me a month ago, bringing Celeste and me together.

“I have to get in!” He screamed at the police.

“Sir, that is not going to be happening tonight. You need to drop the gun!”

I couldn’t see all the details between the strobing lights and the awkward angle from which I was attempting to watch. Just a quick jerking movement from the doctor’s arm with the gun, and then a flurry of sparks and deafening bangs from the police. The doctor’s body was slumped against the doo,r and officers ran towards him shouting.

“Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit!” Celeste screamed.

“He’s going to be alright, right?”

“No, he’s not going to be alright! He’s fucking dead! They fucking shot him!”

“They’re going to want to talk to us, Celeste. Where’s my shirt? I need to find my shirt.”

The next day, Celeste went back to work. We did our best not to talk about what had happened that night, but it was hard not to think about it as we saw the blood-stained concrete in front of the door every day. As best as the police could make out, Dr. Richards was attempting to break in to enact revenge on me. It seemed that he was blaming me for losing his job at the clinic and had been planning on teaching me a lesson. We did our best to put it behind us.

Our love-making had come to a sudden crawl once Celeste had returned to work. I had just assumed it was due to the stress that comes with the hard work she did, but I didn’t really mind. I was glad to have the opportunity to rest and recharge, and Celeste still woke every morning with a smile on her beautiful face. Her work was a drain on her, though, and she’d return sullen. She began to seem distant to me. Her attitude had started to shift. I wasn’t sure if it was the incident with the doctor or the return to work. It could have been all of it. I had a new purpose in life now. I only wanted to make Celeste happy. While she was away, I cleaned and took care of the home. I prepared her meals and made sure she was as comfortable as possible. Nothing seemed to work, though. She’d often snap at me.

“God, you’re fucking pathetic. You know that, right?” She said one day, when I surprised her with flowers one day as she walked through the door.

She apologized later that evening as she mixed our nightly drink. A tradition she had started that I wasn’t particularly fond of, but it had become the only time now that she would sit and chat with me and be kind. The only time we had together anymore that reminded me of our first night together at that Greek restaurant. Every night was a different drink, and she’d refer to herself as a “mixologist”. We’d sit and sip our drinks and chat. I rarely, if ever, enjoyed the drinks, but I learned quickly that she took great offense if I didn’t finish them. We’d go to bed afterwards, where we no longer made love. The bed was only a place for sleeping now.

She had gotten into some sort of trouble at the clinic and was placed on a work program. This meant that she had to start working the late-night shift. We became like ships passing in the night. I’d wake in the morning with the sun and work around the house quietly while she slept. She’d wake as the sun went down and get ready for work. The tradition of our daily drinks did not end. She still insisted on fixing one for me each night before she left. I was just thankful that the few hours that we spent with each other included a brief time of comfort and conversation. I’d have my drink and crawl into bed, and she would leave for work. We carried on like this for months.

I woke one morning to a dull ache in my lump. I looked down to find that it had grown. The skin was blistered and red. I reached down to touch it, and the skin was hot and firm. I pulled myself from bed and fought off the pain with some ibuprofen. When Celeste woke up that evening, I asked her to take a look.

“I think you must have just slept on it wrong. Or didn’t you say you had switched the laundry detergent? It looks to me like an allergic reaction.”

“Allergic? To the detergent?” I asked.

“It’s super common. Don’t worry about it.” She said as she got dressed for her day.

But the pain didn’t subside. Every morning, the lump grew. Bit by bit, it grew until it was the size of a basketball protruding from my side. One morning, when I woke up, there was a small tear in my skin on the lump. Small splotches of blood had stained the sheets.

“You’re perfectly fine.” She’d assured me. “I even asked some of the doctors at the clinic about your situation, and they all agree that this is just a general flare-up. It’ll happen from time to time.”

“How can they know what it is? They haven’t even seen it.” I stammered.

“We have your files at the clinic. They’ve all seen that.”

“But it’s so much bigger now!”

“I know. They know that, too. I’ve shown them the pictures.”

My eyebrows shot up. “Pictures? What pictures?”

“The pictures I took.” She said with a tinge of annoyance.

“What are you talking about, Celeste?”

“I took a couple of photos of your lump when you were asleep. Don’t make a big deal about it.” She said with a scowl. “Celeste, why would you take pictures of it when I’m asleep?”

“This! This right here! This is why!” She snapped. “You’re such a god damn baby about everything. You spent so long moping around the house after Dr. Richards bled out on our front porch.” “That was a traumatic event!” I snapped back.

“You don’t do well with stress, Colin! Maybe it’s because you grew up as such a mama’s boy! I don’t fucking know!” She screamed at me. She took a deep breath and grabbed my shoulders. “You’re soft, Colin. It’s part of why I love you, but it means you don’t handle discomfort well. I know you feel shame around your lump. You shouldn’t feel shame about it, but you do. Am I right?”

I looked down at the floor. I was almost six inches taller than her, but in this moment, I felt so small. “Yeah.”

“You sleep like a rock. It takes an act of god to wake you up when you’re dead asleep. I just figured I’d save you from some embarrassment by taking some quick pictures while you slept. It’s not a big deal.” “You could have asked,” I said sheepishly.

“Colin, you would have been so fucking embarrassed and you know it. I’m only telling you about all of this now because you forced my hand. You know I love you, right?” She slipped her hand up to my chin and lifted my face to meet her gaze.

I nodded as I felt a sinking feeling in my gut. I felt sick to my stomach. This was all too much to take in. I felt violated and betrayed by someone I loved. Was this love? Was this what it meant to be loved? She fixed me a drink as usual. Tonight’s events were swimming through my mind as I was handed a drink. Something to do with a russian donkey. She talked to me as I sipped on my drink. I tried to listen. I nodded my head as if I was listening, but I couldn’t. My stomach churned over and over. I did my best not to let on how truly sick I felt. I knocked back the last of my drink in one swift motion.

“I have to use the restroom.” I blurted as I stood up and walked away.

“Ok. Go get 'em, Lump,” she said as I made my way down the hallway.

I stumbled into the bathroom and quickly shut and locked the door behind me. I promptly fell to my knees and grabbed onto the sides of the toilet. My back arched as I evacuated my insides in a violent blast. It stank of the drink I had just forced down. I immediately felt better. I stood to my feet and wiped the vomit from the corners of my mouth. I flushed the toilet and watched as the vile concoction spiralled down.

I walked back to the living room to find Celeste lounging on the couch, flipping through stations on the TV.

“You have such a small bladder.” She said with a chuckle. She turned her head back and caught a glimpse of me. She bolted upright. “Are you ok?”

“I’m fine.”

“You’re looking pale.”

“I’m just tired.” I lied. I couldn’t bring myself to tell her I couldn’t keep her drink down or that I was upset with her. Even though I didn’t trust her, she was so beautiful. I didn’t want to cause her any sort of pain, and I definitely didn’t want to say anything that would lead to another argument.

“Are you feeling nauseous or anything?” She asked with what seemed like genuine concern.

“No, no. I just had a big day today with cleaning, and I think I didn’t sleep great last night. No big deal. It’s bedtime anyway, so I’m just gonna go to bed.”

“Get some good rest,” she said after me as I made my way to the bedroom.

My head hit the pillow, and I drifted off to sleep. I had the most vivid nightmares of my life that night. I dreamt that there was a beautiful woman with a beautiful voice in love with an attractive man with an ugly voice. They had a long and loving conversation for what seemed like hours. All in soft whispers.

“They can’t keep us apart, my love.”

“Come to me.” The voice gurgled.

“He’s too stupid to know of our love.”

“Tell me you love me.”

“I love you, I love you, I love you.”

“Kill him,” it hissed.

“You know we can’t do that.”

“Take me away”

“You know that’s not an option either, my love.”

“Take me away!” It growled

The voice was horrible. I knew this dream was a nightmare, and I attempted to will myself awake to stop the horrendous voice from speaking. I blinked my eyes open ever so slightly. There in the pale light, I could see Celeste, nude and kneeling down by the bed. She was gently caressing my lump and whispering to it too faintly for me to make sense of the words parting between her lips. I dared not move and lay as still as possible and pretended to sleep. I didn’t know who this woman was, but it was not the Celeste I had fallen in love with back at Niko’s. She stayed there by my side until the sun rose. She looked back over her shoulder towards the rising light and stood up. She dressed in her nurse scrubs and left.

I lay there trying to make sense of the hellish night I had just experienced. Mother had given me bits and pieces of what it was like to have a partner, but she had certainly never described something like this.

I crawled out of bed and made my way downstairs. I could hear Celeste in the kitchen moving dishes around. I walked in to find her making eggs.

I cleared my throat as I took a seat at the kitchen table. “Celeste, last night.”

“Ugh, I can’t right now, Colin. I had a long day at work, so whatever hypochondriac issue you have cooking in that brain of yours is just going to have to go on the back burner.”

“Rough day at work?” I asked, perplexed.

“Yes, Colin. Not all of us got a ton of money from our dead mom. Some of us have to work for a living.”

“Celeste.”

She slammed her wooden spoon down on the counter. “For fuck’s sake, Colin. I have been at work all night dealing with annoying patients faking illnesses for painkillers and creepy doctors staring at my ass all night! I just got home! I just want to eat and go the fuck to bed! Is that too much to fucking ask for? Can you just shut the fuck up for a few fucking minutes and let me have some peace and god damn quiet?” She went back to stirring her eggs with the wooden spoon. I wouldn’t speak another word. I stayed sitting at the table. She finished cooking her eggs and ate them in complete silence. She tossed her fork down onto the empty plate and went to bed. I sat there at the table for hours. I finally stood and went to clean the dried eggs off her plate and pan. As I stood there focusing on the warm water running across my hands, I tried to make sense of how Celeste spent all night whispering to my lump. Why was she lying about being at work all night? I looked up to see the liquor cabinet on the other end of the kitchen beckoning me to open it. Beckoning me to peer inside for the first time since Celeste had claimed it for herself. I dried my hands and flung the doors open. Dozens and dozens of bottles lined the shelves. Brown, green, clear, and yellow. I would have thought it looked pretty if I didn’t already know how vile they tasted. I pulled the bottles out one by one to take a look at what they all were. I smelled each one in turn. Tequila, vodka, vermouth. Gin especially smelled foul. Then I came across a bottle I recognized. A small, plastic, orange bottle with a white cap. A child safety cap. It was my medicine. The medicine that Dr. Richards had given me was but the prescription date was after I had stopped taking the drug. I picked up the bottle to take a closer look, and there, behind that bottle, was another. Behind that bottle was another. I found six bottles in total. Each was jammed with the pills. Enough that had I continued to take them daily, I’d have enough for well over a year. Behind the bottles were two other troubling items. One was a bottle of some sort of medical liquid called Midazolam. The other was a booklet of prescription papers that had previously belonged to Dr. Richards.

I didn’t understand. She said I was perfect the way I was. Why was she giving me the medicine that had been making my lump grow? Why did she have so much of it? So much that she had a prescription pad to order more. What was Midazolam?

I picked up my phone and dialed the Wellspring Clinic.

“Thank you for calling the Wellspring Clinic. Can you please give me your name and date of birth?” Said a raspy-voiced woman on the other end. Her voice rattled with the sound of a lifetime of cigarettes.

“Hi, I’m Colin. I’m not a current patient. I just have a quick question I’m hoping you can help me out with.”

“Sure, Colin, go ahead,” said the smoky voice.

“My girlfriend actually works there. Well, she’s been.”

“Oh! A boyfriend is calling.” She exclaimed. Then with a hushed tone, “Are you planning a surprise? Who is the lucky girl?”

“Uh. Celeste, but what I wanted to ask is.”

“No, I don’t think so,” she interrupted. “Celeste doesn’t work here.”

“What do you mean she doesn't work there? Maybe you just don’t know her.”

“No. I’ve been here for twenty-two years this last Tuesday. I know everyone who works here, and there aren’t that many people to keep track of. It sounds like there is some confusion on your end, and I’m really sorry to have to be the one to break it to you. Celeste really should have been the one to tell you, but I can’t say I’m too surprised. She hasn’t worked here for two months now. She walked out and made a big stink about it. Threw brochures and papers all over the place. Real big mess to clean up.”

“That doesn’t make sense. She’s been going into work every night.”

“Honey, I don’t know where she’s been going every night, but it certainly isn’t the Wellspring Clinic.”

“I don’t understand.”

“Sometimes life throws you a curveball, honey. She’s a looker, and she was a talented nurse, but something in her snapped. She just wasn’t the same there at the end. Hope things get sorted out for you. You take care now, honey.” And with that, the phone went dead.

I was stunned. On the blindside of information slamming into me, I had completely forgotten to ask about the Midazolam.

“What’s going on, my love Lump?”

I spun around on my heels. There stood Celeste in her nightgown. The satin fabric spilled across her breasts, barely containing her as she rubbed the sleep from her eyes.

“What time is it?” She asked through a massive yawn.

The clock on the oven showed 2:33. I had completely lost track of time, getting lost in my thoughts. This was much earlier than she usually woke up, though.

“It’s really early. Why are you up?” I managed to ask through a guilty gulp.

“I just heard you talking to someone.” She walked to a cupboard and started to make some coffee. “Phone?”

“Yeah. Just a wrong number.”

“Sounded like a long phone call for a wrong number.”

“Some pushy salesman calling the wrong number. Couldn’t take no for an answer is all.” I said, staring down into the sink at the rest of the dishes I needed to finish up.

She stood very still for a moment before letting out another big yawn. “Ok,” she squeaked. “I hate those fuckers.” She began to pour the grounds into the top of the coffee maker. “Why don’t you go have a seat in the living room, Lump. I’ll fix my coffee up and I’ll bring you your nightly drink. I think you’ll like the surprise I’ve got lined up for you tonight.”

“Don’t you want to go back to sleep? It’s still so early for you.”

“What’s the point. I won’t be able to get back to sleep anyway, and we can hang out for a couple of extra hours. Go, have a seat, and relax. I’ll take care of mommy’s itty bitty boy.” She gently pushed me out of the kitchen and into the living room. “Sit, sit, sit.”

I plopped down onto the sofa. What in the world was going on? I reached down to hold my swollen lump, still the size of a basketball. What was her obsession, and what exactly was she putting in my drinks? She soon emerged from the kitchen with her coffee in one hand and a tall glass of brown liquid in the other.

“Thought we’d just go for an easy classic for you tonight.” She shoved the drink into my hand. “Whiskey on the rocks.”

She sat down across from me and leaned in close. She reached up and ran her fingers through my hair. “Drink up.”

I brought the drink slowly up to my lips and began to take a sip. She lifted her hand up to the bottom of the glass and tilted it back. The whiskey and whatever else was in there flooded into my mouth. I swallowed it down with a few gulps, and it burned the back of my throat and nose. This was by far the worst-tasting drink she had given me, but I had managed to drink it down.

“Good boy.” She patted me on the head and took my glass. “I’m going to make breakfast real quick. You just lie here and relax. She made her way to the kitchen while looking back over her exposed shoulder at me with a smile. “I’ll be right back.”

As soon as she left the view of the living room, I jumped to my feet and ran down the hallway to the bathroom. I assumed my position at the toilet and let loose a violent torrent of brown fire and mystery medicine. I hadn’t eaten all day, so the contents of my stomach were almost empty save for the drink and bile. I flushed it down and ran back to the couch Celeste had left me at while wiping the corners of my mouth free of vomit for a second night in a row. I plopped down and did my best to appear comfortable. A moment later, Celeste came back in with a slice of toast and her coffee. She sat down across from me once again.

“Wanna watch the bachelor?”

I nodded my head. “Sure.”

I couldn’t tell you what happened on the bachelor. Even when I wasn’t in fear for my life I couldn’t stand the show. I only sat through it because Celeste loved it so much. I found every person on the show absolutely horrible, but she thought the show was hilarious. We made it through the episode when she looked over at me and furrowed her eyebrows.

“Aren’t you tired?”

This was it. She was expecting me to be tired from the drink. I had to play along in order to try to piece together the puzzle of how she was spending her nights. I put my arms up high over my head and faked a yawn. “Oh, I am bushed,” I said as I started rubbing my eyes. I really needed to sell the idea that I was tired. “I think I’ll go get in bed early tonight.”

“Sounds good, Lump. Sweet dreams.”

I brushed the vomit and whiskey out of my teeth and crawled into bed. Truthfully, I was tired. Whatever she had given me was making me feel drowsy even after having put most of it down into the sewers below. My eyelids grew heavy as I lay still beneath the warm, soft sheets. I couldn’t lie there much longer pretending to be asleep before I actually fell asleep. The world grew dark and distant as I drifted off.

I dreamt again that night. More whispering between two beautiful lovers. One with the voice of an angel and the other with the sounds of an injured animal that had learned to talk.

“Did you bring it?” said the pained voice

“I bring it every night, love.”

“It’s time.”

“I can’t. I just can’t.

“Just do it already.” It snarled gt I felt a pinch. I peeled my eyelids apart to find, once again, Celeste nude and kneeling next to the bed. Rubbing my lump and whispering frantically. I watched her for a few minutes. If this were anything like the night before, she would continue on for hours and hours before ending her bizarre pastime. “Celeste?” I asked weakly through dry lips that stuck together as I said her name.

Her whispering stopped immediately, and she slowly turned her head to look at me.

“Celeste?” I licked my lips to moisten them. “What are you doing?”

She moved her hands down as if to hide them and continued to stare at me.

“Celeste. I called your work today. I know you’re no longer working at the clinic. I know you’ve been spending the nights coming in here and talking to yourself. I don’t know what’s going on, but I am deeply worried about you.”

Nothing. It was as though there was nothing there. She stared back at me with the eyes of an empty person.

“What are you hiding, Celeste?

Her gaze finally broke away from mine, and a look of shame spread across her face like wildfire. She handed me a small syringe.

“Celeste. What is going on?” I whispered to her.

With that, her nose crinkled and tears welled up in her eyes. She began weeping and placed her head down on my chest. My face was covered with her hair.

I put my hand onto her head and gently caressed her hair. “Tell me what’s wrong, Celeste. We can fix this. We can make things like they were once. We can get you help.”

I felt wet. A warm wetness. At first, I thought it was her tears cascading down me, but it was so much. It was all over me. I reached my hand down out of sight to touch the wetness and brought it back up to see. My fingers were drenched in red. I grabbed Celeste by the shoulder and sat her up along with me. The sheets were covered in blood, I was covered in blood, and Celeste was covered in blood. There in Celeste’s hand was a scalpel. “Celeste! No! Why? Please don’t do this. You have so much to live for! I love you!” I screamed. I grabbed the scalpel to rip it away from her. In doing so, I sliced deep into my left hand, but I had managed to throw the instrument across the room. I didn’t care about my hand. I could fix that later, but for now, I needed to find where she had cut herself. I grabbed her arms to see where she had made the slices. It was difficult to maneuver my hand with the deep gash. I must have sliced through some tendons, but I had enough dexterity to lift her arms up and find nothing.

“Where did you cut yourself, Celeste! Please tell me!” I grabbed her head and started moving it around to see if she had cut her throat. Once again, nothing. All I could see was a perfectly healthy, beautiful woman covered in blood and weeping. I looked down, and that was when I saw it. I was the source of blood. A gash running across the lump had exposed the yellow and white of the fatty tissue beneath the skin. It ran the entire length of the lump, and it was clear that the growth was beginning to make its way out.

“Celeste! Why? Why did you do this?” I screamed. I took both my hands and, to the best of my ability, I attempted to hold the wound closed. Blood seeped from between the two flaps of skin. The wound looked awful, but I could barely feel it. Other than the wetness and warmth of the blood, there was almost no feeling at all. “We were supposed to be together.” Said Celeste as she plunged her hands between the folds of skin I was holding together. No pain, but an overwhelming sense of pressure swelled up within me. I could feel a tugging at my innards. I let go with one hand and punched her square in the nose. It broke with a deafening crack as she fell backwards. Her hands, along with some of my intestines, spilled out of me. I grabbed them as quickly as I could and frantically started to shove them back inside.

Celeste leaped to her feet and lunged at me. I threw up my arms and managed to throw her down to the floor again. This short victory came at the cost of the intestines slipping out once more. This time, they plopped down onto the floor with a sickening, wet thud. I stood up, and the intestines spilled out more. I grabbed at them and tried to shove them back in with limited success. Celeste screamed incoherently. Her naked body writhed in the wetness, and her hair was a tangled, matted mess. Her eyes darted across the room to the scalpel on the floor. We both made a mad dash to be the first to get to it. There, our bodies entangled in a slippery mess on the floor. I held her face back with my limp hand. She bit into it deeply. I screamed out in pain, but I had a firm grip of the scalpel with the other hand. As she bit deeper and deeper into me, I swung the end of the blade upward into her throat. I swung the blade hard and deep over and over and over again. I kept swinging it after her body went limp and fell lifeless beside me.

Panting, I stumbled to my feet and grabbed at my side in an attempt to hold the wound closed. It was clear that I needed to stop the bleeding as soon as I could. I grabbed a towel and held it tightly to the cut. I made my way over to the mirror to see what Celeste had done to me. There it was. A clean cut about a foot long going vertically down my side. At the bottom were my intestines hanging out and dragging on the floor behind me. I moved the towel to the side a bit more to get a better look at the cut. As the folds of skin separated, I could make out a pair of milky eyes. They blinked.

I slowly peeled back the folds of skin and could make out more of a face. It was disgusting by any measure. Instead of a nose, it had only two shriveled holes. It’s lips were pulled back so far that they were barely there, and behind them were it’s gums holding onto tiny, chiclets of teeth. It had strands of hair falling across it’s brow in a wet mess, and it’s skin was mottled with vibrant reds, yellows, and sickening greys. It gasped for breath as if it had never tasted air before. With every breath it gulped down, I could feel my own lungs fill with a foul stench.

I couldn’t breathe. I had so many questions. Had this been in the entire time? Was this what Celeste wanted? What was I looking at? Most importantly, why was it so beautiful? Something about this thing was drawing me in. It called to me. I knew now what Mother meant when she talked about love at first sight. I knew the kind of love she described to me in fairy tales. I thought what I had felt for Celeste was love, but that paled in comparison to this.

I pulled back at my skin and pushed from within to reveal as much as I could. There in my childhood bedroom, I held the face of my beloved. It’s face would be the last thing I would see before I drifted off to sleep one last time. Although Celeste had brought my life to an end, she had taught me that in the end, I could truly learn to love myself.",4,1753448952.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1m8ynep,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1m8ynep/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

I know exercise calories are hard to track and as l heard so many people overestimate their calorie needs.
I have been thinking about changing my routine while on maintance 
I track my heart rate by counting my pulse for 15 seconds and multiplying by 4, because I know calorie trackers aren’t always accurate.
 Right now, I do 40 minutes of stationary biking with a heart rate around 100 bpm 6 times a week, and I walk 40 minutes six times a week with my heart rate usually between 80–90 bpm. 
Before walking, I alwasy drink  a cup of tea, and later a cup of coffee. I’m wondering if these drinks affect my heart rate significantly. 
Also, I’m thinking about adding 3–4 times muay thai classes a week, each lasting about 50 minutes, on top of my current routine. 
Currently, I’m eating at a sedentary calorie level. To maintain my weight without gaining,
 what calorie level should I aim for given my current and potential future activity?
I don't really want to risk to be tired that l might faint after my potential future activity.

# Testimony Transcript

*(Source: Civilian #6291, Designation: ""Lila Monroe"")*

I'm writing this because no one will believe me, and I'm running out of time. Something’s happening. Something awful. It’s 9:47 PM now, and I can’t stop thinking about 7:13 PM. That’s when it happens. Every day.

I work data entry at TechCorp. Boring job, boring building, boring life. Until Monday.

I was at my desk, sipping coffee, when my plastic cup just… crunched. Like someone crushed it in their fist, but nobody was there. It collapsed inward, folding into itself with this sickening crack, like bones snapping. It happened so fast I screamed and knocked over my chair. The plastic crumpled into this perfect little cube, maybe an inch wide, sitting in a puddle of coffee. My heart was pounding so hard I thought I’d pass out.

Jake came over asking what happened. I tried explaining but I sounded crazy even to myself. “Maybe you gripped it too hard,” he said, trying to be nice. “You've been working a lot of overtime.” But I felt the air pressure change. I felt my eardrums pop as the space the cup occupied just... disappeared.

I spent the rest of the day googling “spontaneous plastic deformation,” but found nothing. That night, I couldn’t sleep. I kept hearing that crunch in my head, seeing the cup twist like it was alive.

Tuesday, it got worse. It was 7:13 PM again—I was scrolling on my phone. I was in the break room, alone, when the water cooler, one of those big five-gallon jugs, just… collapsed. It didn’t crack or leak—it imploded, like a giant invisible hand crushed it. The plastic buckled inward with a sound like a car crash. The water didn't splash—it compressed too, becoming this dense, syrupy mass that stayed perfectly contained.. I fell back, gasping, my hands shaking so bad I couldn’t hold my phone. A couple of coworkers ran in, but they didn’t see it happen. “Maybe it was defective,” Sarah said like it was no big deal. Defective? That thing folded like paper! I tried to tell them, but they looked at me like I was losing it. I’m not losing it. I’m not.

***\[Foundation Note:\] Subject’s observation of localized spatial contractions aligns with Veil-thinning activity in node #POR-022. Veil integrity at risk. Monitoring escalated.***

Wednesday, the implosions got crazier. It’s always 7:13 PM—I’m sure of it now. I was at my desk, watching the clock, dreading it. 7:12 PM. My stomach was in knots. Then, right on cue, my monitor imploded. The screen didn’t shatter—it crumpled inward, like a black hole sucked it dry, with a sound like glass screaming. I jumped back, screaming, and Jake ran over. “What the hell, Lila? You broke it?” I yelled that I didn’t touch it, that it just happened, but he shook his head, said I needed to chill. Chill? My monitor was a twisted wreck, and he’s telling me to chill? I heard whispers in the break room later—Sarah saying she saw a chair collapse in the conference room, another guy saying his stapler “fell apart weirdly.” But nobody’s talking about it, like they’re scared to admit it. I’m not imagining this. I’m not.

That's when these people showed up, calling themselves researchers. They had official-looking badges and white coats, said they were from something called *The Threshold Foundation*. They brought in all this equipment and started taking measurements, but they didn’t talk to us, didn’t smile, just moved like they were following a program. One of them, a woman with eyes that didn’t blink enough, was staring at a wall, whispering, “The node is stable.” I asked what she meant, but she ignored me, like I wasn’t even there.

By Thursday, half my coworkers had called in sick or started working from home. The few who remained wouldn't talk about what was happening. I tried calling my boss, Tom, to figure out what was going on, but his line went straight to voicemail. Always does now.

But I kept watching. I kept counting down.

7:13 PM became this weight in my chest, this gravitational pull I could feel approaching. At 7:10, my heartbeat would sync with this low-frequency hum that seemed to come from the building itself. At 7:12, the air would get thick, like breathing honey. And then, at exactly 7:13, something would collapse.

The explorers are different now. They’re not blending in anymore. They’re in full hazmat suits, white and sterile, with goggles that reflect nothing but light. They’re dragging in heavy equipment—drills, scanners, things that hum so low it makes my teeth hurt. They’re not measuring walls anymore; they’re tearing into them, pulling out wires that spark and writhe like snakes. I heard one say, “The Pattern must be preserved,” and it sounded like a prayer, not science. People are quitting now. Sarah didn’t show up today. Jake’s acting weird, like he’s not himself. I keep finding notes on my desk I didn’t write: *7:13 PM. The Pattern awaits.*

***\[Foundation Note:\] Subject’s fixation on temporal anomalies and Explorer Unit E-512’s operations indicates severe Veil breach. $THLD resources allocated for node stabilization.***

I started staying late, trying to figure out what they were doing. The building gets really quiet after hours, just the hum of the air conditioning and these weird low sounds coming from upstairs. I'm not supposed to have access to the fourth floor but my keycard worked tonight.

I wish it hadn't.

I found a maintenance door that was cracked open. Inside was this narrow tunnel with pipes running along the walls. I could hear someone breathing heavy, like they were hurt. I followed the sound to another door and looked through the little window.

There was a man in one of those white hazmat suits, but something was wrong with him. He was leaning against the wall, shaking, and part of his left arm looked... smaller? Like it had been squeezed. The suit was torn open at the shoulder and I could see his arm was compressed down to maybe half its normal size, all twisted and wrong.

I opened the door and he looked up at me with these wide, terrified eyes.

“Oh, you shouldn't be here,” he gasped. “It's still active, the compression field is still-”

He stopped talking and stared at his legs. I looked down and nearly threw up. His left leg was slowly getting shorter, like something invisible was crushing it from the knee down. I could hear these awful wet cracking sounds as his bones folded in on themselves.

“Jesus Christ,” I whispered, reaching for my phone to call 911.

“No!” he shouted, grabbing my arm with his good hand. His grip was so tight it felt like needles, and his fingers were starting to buckle, curling inward like they were being sucked into themselves. “No time! Just… help me document this. Write down what you see. The Pattern needs to know!”

*It’s 7:09 PM*. My hands are shaking so bad I can barely hold his tablet. He’s screaming measurements—numbers, angles, things that make no sense: “Compression rate, 3.2 centimeters per minute! Density increasing!” His voice is calm, like a scientist, but his face is twisted in pain, veins bulging, sweat mixing with that black stuff creeping up his neck. His leg is gone now, just a stump folding into his hip, and the sound—it’s like gravel grinding in a blender.

***\[Foundation Note:\] Subject’s exposure to Explorer Unit E-514’s terminal degradation confirms critical Pattern Corruption.***

*It’s 7:10 PM*. I’m crying, begging him to let me get help, but he won’t stop. “Write it down!” he screams, shoving the tablet closer. His chest is starting to cave, ribs snapping one by one, each crunch making me gag. His eyes are wild, not with fear but with reverence, like he’s seeing something holy. “The Pattern is eternal,” he whispers, his voice breaking as his shoulder collapses inward, his arm folding into a cube no bigger than a fist.

*It’s 7:11 PM*. I can’t breathe. The air’s so thick it’s choking me. His torso is shrinking now, flesh and bone compressing into a grotesque, geometric mass. He’s still dictating, his voice a rasp: “Structural integrity failing. Core density at 87%. Record it!” I’m sobbing, typing nonsense on his tablet. I try to pull away, but he grabs me again, his hand half-gone, fingers merging into a single, twitching mass.

*It’s 7:12 PM*. The hum is deafening, a scream inside my skull. His body is barely human—just a writhing, collapsing shape. His face is folding inward, his jaw crunching shut, but he keeps talking, his voice coming from nowhere: “For the Pattern!” I drop the tablet, screaming, backing away as his body twists.

*7:13 PM*. He finally implodes. Not silent this time—a deafening crack, like the world snapping shut. The air collapses inward, pulling at my clothes, my hair, my skin, leaving a perfect, red cube on the floor, and I’m screaming so loud my throat burns.

I ran. I'm home now, typing this with shaking hands. I keep hearing footsteps in the hallway outside my apartment.

I need to tell someone about this. What the hell happened at TechCorp ?? What is this “Threshold Foundation” ? These “explorers” ?? I'm going to post this everywhere I can, send it to news stations, upload it to every forum and social media site I can find.

So besides working forty-six hours a week at Bethel we had Monday night's *Watchtower study* and *primary school,* and Tuesday and Friday nights were meetings at your local Kingdom Hall. Sundays were for Field Service in the mornings and meetings in the afternoons. Basically, the only free time you had were two weekday nights and Saturday afternoons and evenings. After working, sleeping, meetings and subway rides we had about 15 to 17 hours of free time every week.

So, guess what many of us Bethelites did with all that extra free time? We got another job!

Those at Bethel called those outside jobs *G-jobs.* Some said it stood for government job. No one really knows where the name came from. A *G-Job* was any job that you worked at to make money outside of Bethel, more than the seventy-three cents a DAY or the twenty-two dollars a month Bethel gave us. We spent almost nine dollars (of the twenty two dollars) a month, just on subway tokens to get back and forth to our Kingdom Halls. So, after those necessary traveling expenses, if you do the math, we were really only making about seven cents an hour.

I heard a story about a guy who was mugged in New York City. The mugger put a gun to his victim's head and said, “Give me your money or I’m going to blow your brains out!” The man said, “Well you better shoot. Because I know one thing about New York: You can live here without brains, but you gotta have money!”

Most of us Betheites had little to no money.

Many of the guys at Bethel had families that couldn’t send them any extra cash for the basic necessities. That meant earning even ten or twenty bucks extra a week could make a big difference in making life a little more comfortable there.

When the Sisters forgot to make your dinner at the Kingdom Hall, with that extra cash, there could be a slice of pizza in your future. Or once or twice a week, you could get a hero sandwich and a quart of beer down at the *Plymouth Deli.* If you were really rolling in cash, you could buy a chuck steak at 69 cents a pound and some frozen French fries, add one onion and cook it up in your room on an electric skillet. A cheap steak and a quart of beer and life was good.

For really special occasions, there was a restaurant that was a Bethelite’s idea of a real paradise. If one of our buddies *“made his time”* and was leaving Bethel, the restaurant of choice to celebrate at was *Steak & Brew.* For about $7.95, you could buy a complete dinner consisting of an appetizer, a steak, veggies, a baked potato, ice cream and coffee. But, the most important thing to us Bethelites was the promise of unlimited beer, wine or sangria. Of course, it was the cheapest rot-gut beer you could get in New York City at the time, but we didn’t care. Just say the words *Steak & Brew* and a Bethelite’s eyes would light up.

Yes, just a couple of extra dollars a month could make a real difference there.

Believe it or not, most of the extra money we made went to food. The reason for that is explained in the next chapter.

There were many different types of *G-jobs* the Brothers were willing to do for a little extra money.

Some guys in the pressroom ran *the paper route.* It started at 3:00 a.m. on Sunday mornings. You would run through apartment buildings delivering this massive Sunday editions of the newspaper to people’s doorways. I did it once. Not for me.

Some lucky guys got jobs at the *Fleur De Lis* catering hall in Brooklyn as waiters at wedding receptions. That job provided great tips, plus you could keep all the half-drunk bottles of wine when it was over. You might have to pick out a cigarette butt or two, but what the heck? There was a waiting list to work there and it was very tough to get hired on there.

Some guys found jobs painting apartments. Anything for a buck.

My friend Jim Pipkorn worked at a funeral home in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. It was always fun visiting him at his place of employment. One Saturday afternoon, I went to his funeral home to pick him up to go to a movie on *Times Square*.

When I got there the owner told me. “He is downstairs in the basement.,”  I looked down the stairs and shook my head no and said. “It’s okay I'll wait up here.” He looked at me and smiled. I, on the other hand, really didn’t want to go down there. Jim must have heard us upstairs talking. “Keith, come on down here. *They* won’t hurt you.” I slowly walked down the stairs to the basement.

As I expected, there were dead people down there. Two guys in white aprons were hunched over an old dead guy lying on a porcelain table. There were tubes and needles everywhere and blood pouring down the table into a waiting bucket. There was another old dead guy on an embalming table next to them as they worked. He was naked with a strange look on his face. This dead guy also had a sixteen-ounce can of *Rheingold beer* perched in the middle of his chest. As the undertakers were working, the oldest one would reach over and take the can of beer off the dead guy’s chest and take a swig from it. I wondered what this dead guy’s relatives would have thought if they could have seen their dead grandpa with a can of beer on his chest.

Another time I visited Jim at the funeral home, he was alone in the basement. He showed me a large refrigerator where they kept the dead people. He opened one of the drawers and rolled out a dead black pimp. The guy had been stabbed about twenty times. He then rolled out a dead woman in her twenties. There wasn’t a mark on her body. She had no hands and no head. The missing limbs had been surgically removed.

“Why?” I asked Jim.

“Because whoever killed her knew that if she could be identified, the killers could be caught. She had no birthmarks or tattoos, yet the police still identified her. How do you think they did that?”

“I don’t know, feet marks?” I said.

“No such thing."" He said. ""They found that she had an IUD that had a serial number on it.” Sure enough they caught the guys that did it. 

One of my first *G-jobs* was as a dishwasher. I washed pots and pans in a high-end restaurant three blocks from Bethel. I was a true “*pot licker.*”

To this day, I will not order turkey and dressing in a restaurant. The restaurant served little miniature loaves of bread. People would eat half of them and then put out their cigarettes in what was left of the bread. The waiters would bring what was left of the loaf of bread to the kitchen and throw them in a dirty cardboard box on the floor. Next week the bread in that box was the stuffing for the Thursday's turkey-and-bread-stuffing special.

I also worked in two liquor stores, one in the *Inwood* area and one in *Brooklyn Heights*. Hey, one dollar and seventy-five cents an hour seemed like good money. I was only making seven cents an hour working for Jehovah. I guess Jehovah doesn’t believe in minimum wage. Some nights, I wouldn’t bring home any money. Instead, I traded my earnings for one of two of my best friends: *Jack Daniels* or *Johnnie Walker*.

At this time, Dave Borga, the waiter who showed me the *hot end* of the dishwasher, worked in the pressroom.

Dave would go down in Bethel history as the *king of all G-jobbers*. They still speak about him to this day, fifty years later, in the *new boy talks.* While working at his Bethel job, he also had a full-time job working the night shift at a toy factory in New Jersey. That’s right, he was working almost eighty hours a week! He was getting by on just three to four hours of sleep each night. Needless to say, he didn’t last long, working at that pace. But he was able to buy a newer Ford Mustang before he got kicked out and had to leave Bethel and drive back home to Wisconsin.

Dave finally left the religion he grew up in and has been out for almost thirty years. However, he has recently re-joined the church again. He met a rich good looking Jehovah's Witness widow who started *a home Bible Study* with him.

I sent him my book but it was too late. I talked to him on the phone and he told me how we are living in ""The last days of the last days again."" Dave is now getting ready for Armageddon again.. Good luck Dave.

As Al Pacino said in the Godfather movie *""Just when I thought I was out... they sucked me back in!""*

One weekend, Jack Sutton and I painted a whole apartment for only one-hundred-and-fifty dollars. Seventy-five dollars apiece. Of course, it would have taken us almost four months at our Bethel jobs to make that kind of money. We knew we had under bid the job when the alcoholic owner came home with over a hundred dollars’ worth of booze.

He loved us.

P.S. Bethelites are no longer allowed to get an outside Job. They got *new light* on the matter. Now as a new boy you are required to sign a document stating that outside work is not allowed and that you take a *take a vow of poverty.*

Rich Church but poor workers. Just one m*ore Catch 22.*

I’m traveling solo and staying in Göreme for 2 full days (arriving the night before). I’ve got some questions and would really appreciate your advice:

1. Hot Air Balloon Ride:
Is it better to book online in advance, or should I wait and book in Göreme 1-2 days before? I’m worried about availability and price differences.

2. Sunset Activity:
I’m torn between ATV vs horseback riding during sunset. Which one do you recommend for a solo traveler? Which has the better vibe, views, and experience?

3. Rooftop Breakfast Spot:
Any early-morning rooftop cafes or restaurants where I can watch the hot air balloons while having breakfast or coffee? Preferably somewhere with a great view and chill atmosphere.

4. Other Must-Do Activities:
Aside from the balloon ride and sunset tour, what are the other top things I shouldn’t miss? I’d love a mix of culture, nature, and photography spots.

5. Getting Around:
Is it better to join group tours (like Green or Red Tour) or explore on my own using taxis/local transport? I’m open to either but would love to hear what’s most practical and cost-effective.

Any extra tips for solo travelers in Cappadocia are very welcome!

1m8yfvi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m8yfvi,I can’t believe I paid less than £22 for this set! Tangzu Wan ‘er 2 Jade special edition.,"First off the unboxing was damn good. Nice big packaging and attractive artwork. But then when opening it I got greeted with the artwork again… but on a nice big lint free cleaning cloth. Then when I removed that I surprised by IEM units themselves and a nice silicone carry case. The iem is plastic (as to be expected) but the lovely Jade coloured plastic makes them look more expensive. Then the dragon design on the faceplate is nicely detailed too. The nozzles are metal and feel super sturdy. Then once that layer is  removed there are two different sets of eartips underneath. The Tangzu wide bore and a set of normal smokey style tips. 6 sets i. Total which is fantastic as it means if you were gifting this then you don’t need to worry if the wide bore will be suitable for someone or not. (I’ve paid £6 for a set of the wide bore tips on their own individually before so was surprised they just come as standard here). 

My only gripes really are that the earhooks don’t sit flush on my ears by it’s nothing a hairdryer couldn’t fix. But the rest of the lead is pretty good for a budget offering. I’ve seen worse on similarly priced sets (*cough KZ cough*).

Soundwise it’s the Single DD from the Wan ‘er 2 you’ve come to expect. I was Surprised by the clean bass, ok mids and light airy treble. You could blind test these with some of your friends and they’d probably say these cost more than they actually do. 

Overall this set was an amazing purchase for less than 4-5 coffees. Amazing looking lint free cloth, silicone carry case with magnetised clasp at the top, plastic but nicely designed iem shell, a reasonably good lead and 6 sets of eartips. I’m tempted to buy another set just so I can keep them and gift them to someone in the future. ",28,1753448188.0,iems,4,1.0,False

The Rules Are Changing,"Read: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenHorrorWriters/comments/1m8yc5x/night_shift_at_the_evergrove_market_day_1/)

Believe it or not, I’ve made it three whole weeks in this nightmare.

Three weeks of bone-deep whispers, flickering lights, and pale things pretending to be people.

And somehow, against all odds, I keep making it to sunrise.

By now, I’ve realized something very comforting—sarcasm fully intended:

The horror here runs on a schedule.

The Pale Lady shows up every night at exactly 1:15 a.m.

Not a minute early. Not a second late.

She always asks for meat—the same meat she already knows is in the freezer behind the store.

I never see her leave. She just stands there, grinning like a damn wax statue for two straight minutes… then floats off to get it herself.

Every third night, the lights go out at 12:43 a.m.

Right on the dot.

Just long enough for me to crawl behind a shelf, hold my breath, and wonder what thing is breathing just a few feet away in the dark.

And every two days, the ancient intercom crackles to life and croaks the same cheerful death sentence:

“Attention Evergrove Staff. Remi in aisle 8, please report to the reception.”

It’s always when I’m in aisle 8.

It’s always my name.

The only thing that changes is the freak show of “customers” after 2 a.m.

They’re different from the hostile monster I met on my first shift—more… polite. Fake.

On Wednesdays, it’s an old woman with way too many teeth and no concept of personal space.

Thursdays, a smooth-talking businessman in a sharp suit follows me around, asking for the latest cigarettes.

I never respond.

Rule 4 …. is pretty clear:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

And the old man—my “boss”—well, he’s always surprised to see me at the end of each shift.

Not happy. Not relieved.

Just... surprised. Like he’s been quietly rooting for the building to eat me.

This morning? Same deal. He walked in at 6:00 a.m. sharp, his coat still covered in frost that somehow never melts.

“Here’s your paycheck,” he said, sliding the envelope across the breakroom table.

$500 for another night of surviving hell. 

But this time, something was different in his face.

Less dead-eyed exhaustion, more… pity. Or maybe fear.

“So, promotion’s the golden ticket out, huh?” I said, dry as dust, like the idea didn’t make my skin crawl. Not that I’d ever take it.

That note from my first night still burned in the back of my skull like a warning:

DON’T ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

He didn’t answer right away. Just looked at me like I’d said something dangerous.

Finally, he muttered, “You better hope you don’t survive long enough to be offered one.”

Yeah. That shut me up.

He sat across from me, his eyes flicking toward the clock like something was counting down.

“This place,” he said, voice low like he was afraid it might hear him, “after midnight… it stops being a store.”

His gaze didn’t meet mine. It drifted toward the flickering ceiling light, like he was remembering something he wished he could forget.

“It looks the same. Aisles. Shelves. Registers. But underneath, it’s different. It turns into something else. A threshold. A mouth. A… trap.”

He paused, hands tightening around his mug until the ceramic creaked.

“There’s something on the other side. Watching. Waiting. And every so often… it reaches through.”

He took a breath like he’d just surfaced from deep water.

“That’s when people get ‘promoted.’”

He said the word like it tasted rotten.

I frowned. “Promoted by who?”

He looked at me then. Just for a second.

Not with fear. With resignation.

Like he’d already accepted, his answer was too late to help me.

“He wears a suit. Always a suit. Too perfect. Too still. Like he was made in a place where nothing alive should come from.”

The old man’s voice went brittle.

“You’ll know him when you see him. Something about him... it doesn’t belong in this world. Doesn’t pretend to, either. Like a mannequin that learned how to walk and smile, but not why.”

Another pause.

“Eyes like mirrors. Smile like a trap. And a voice you’ll still hear three days after he’s gone.”

His fingers trembled now, just a little.

“This place calls him the Night Manager.”

I didn’t say anything at first.

Just sat there, staring at the old man while the weight of his words sank in like cold water through a thin coat.

The Night Manager.

The name itself felt wrong. Too simple for something that didn’t sound remotely human.

I swallowed hard, suddenly aware of every flickering shadow in the corners of the breakroom.

The hum of the vending machine behind me sounded like it was breathing.

Finally, I managed to speak, voice quieter than I expected.

“…How long have you been working here?”

He stared into his coffee for a long moment. When he finally spoke, his voice was smaller.

“I was fifteen. Came here looking for my dad.”

Another pause. Longer this time. He looked like the words hurt.

“There was a girl working with me. Younger than you. Two months in, she got offered a promotion. Took it. Gone the next day. No trace. No mention. Just... erased.”

He kept going, softer now.

“Found out later my dad got the same offer. Worked four nights. Just four. Then vanished. No goodbye. No clue. Just... gone.”

Then he looked at me. And I swear, for the first time, he looked human—not like the tired crypt keeper who hands me my checks.

“That’s when I stopped looking for him,” he said. “His fate was the same as everyone else who took the promotion. Just… gone.”

And then the clock hit 6:10, and just like that, he waved me off. Like he hadn’t just dumped a lifetime of this store’s lore straight into my lap.

I went home feeling... something. Dread? Grief? Maybe both.

But here’s the thing—I still sleep like a rock. Every single night.

It’s a skill I picked up after years of dozing off to yelling matches through the walls.

I guess that’s the only upside to having nothing left to care about—silence sticks easier when there’s no one left to miss you.

There wasn’t anything left to do anyways. I’d already exhausted every half-rational plan to claw my way out of this waking nightmare.

After my first shift, I went full tinfoil-hat mode—hours lost in internet rabbit holes, digging through dead forums, broken archives, and sketchy conspiracy blogs.

Evergrove Market. The town. The things that whisper after midnight.

Nothing.

Just ancient Reddit threads with zero replies, broken links, and a wall of digital silence.

Not even my overpriced, utterly useless engineering degree could make sense of it.

By the third night, I gave up on Google and stumbled into the town library as soon as it opened at 7 a.m. I looked like hell—raccoon eyes, hoodie, stale energy drink breath. A walking red flag.

The librarian clocked me instantly. One glance, and I knew she’d mentally added me to the “trouble” list.

Still, I gave it a shot.

I asked her if they had anything on cursed buildings, haunted retail spaces, or entities shaped like oversized dogs with jaws that hinged the wrong way.

She gave me the kind of look reserved for people who mutter to themselves on public transit. One perfectly raised brow and a twitch of the hand near the desk phone, like she was debating whether to dial psych services or security.

Honestly? I wouldn’t have blamed her.

But she didn’t. And I walked out with nothing but more questions.

This morning, I slept like a corpse again.

Three weeks of surviving hell shifts had earned me one thing: the ability to pass out like the dead and wake up to return to torture I now call work.

But the moment I walked through the door, something was wrong.

Not just off—wrong. It felt like standing at the edge of a cliff, gravity whispering your name. Everything in me screamed: run.

But the contract? The contract said don’t.

And I’m more scared of breaking that than dying.

So I stepped inside.

The reception was empty.

No old man. No sarcastic remarks. No frost-covered coat.

I checked the usual places—the haunted freezer, aisle 8, even the breakroom.

Nothing. No one.

My shift started quietly. Too quietly.

It was Thursday, so I waited for the schedule to kick in.

Pale Lady at 1:15. The businessman around 3. Then the whispers. The lights. The routine nightmare.

But tonight, the system failed.

At 1:30, the freezer started humming.

In reverse.

Not a metaphor. Literally backwards. Like someone had rewound reality by mistake. The air around aisle five warped with the sound, like it was bending under the weight of something it couldn’t see.

Even the Pale Lady didn’t show up tonight. And that freak never misses her meat run.

No flickering lights. No intercom.

Just silence.

Then, at 3:00 a.m., the businessman arrived.

Same tailored suit. Same perfect hair. But no words. No stalking.

He walked up to the front doors, pulled a laminated sheet from inside his jacket, and slapped it against the glass.

Then he left.

No nod. No look. No goodbye.

Just gone.

I walked up to the door, heart already thudding. I didn’t even need to read it.

Same font. Same laminate.

Same cursed format that had already ruined any hope of a normal life.

Another list.

**NEW STAFF DIRECTIVE – PHASE TWO**

*Effective Immediately*

I started reading.

1. **The reflections in the cooler doors are no longer yours after 2:17 a.m. Do not look at them. If you accidentally do, keep eye contact. It gets worse if you look away first.**

Cool. Starting strong.

1. **If you hear a baby crying in Aisle 3, proceed to the loading dock and lock yourself inside. Stay there for exactly 11 minutes. No more. No less.**

Because babies are terrifying now, apparently.

1. **A second you may arrive at any time. Do not speak to them. Do not let them speak to you. If they say your name, cover your ears and run to the cleaning supply closet. Lock the door. Count to 200. Wait for silence.**

What the actual hell?

1. **If you find yourself outside the store without remembering how you got there—go back inside immediately. Do not look at the sky.**
2. **Something new lives behind the canned goods aisle. If you hear it breathing, whistle softly as you walk by. It hates silence.**
3. **If the intercom crackles at 4:44 a.m., stop whatever you're doing and lie face down on the floor. Do not move. You will hear your name spoken backward. Do not react.**
4. **Do not use the bathroom between 1:33 a.m. and 2:06 a.m. Someone else is in there. They do not know they are dead.**
5. **If the fluorescent lights begin to pulse in sets of three, you are being watched. Do not acknowledge it. Speak in a language you don’t know until it passes.**
6. **There will be a man in a suit standing just outside the front doors at some point. His smile will be too wide. He does not blink. Do not let him in. Do not wave. Do not turn your back.**
7. **If the emergency alarm sounds and you hear someone scream your mother’s name—run. Do not stop. Do not check the time. Run until your legs give out or the sun rises. Whichever comes first.**

I blinked.

Once.

Twice.

What the actual hell?

April Fools? Except it’s July. And no one here has a sense of humor—least of all me.

I stared at one of the lines, as if rereading it would somehow make it make sense:

""A second you may arrive tonight. Do not speak to them…""

Yeah. Totally normal. Just me and my evil doppelgänger hanging out in aisle three.

""Do not look at the sky.""

""Speak in a language you don’t know.""

""Run until your legs give out or the sun rises.""

By the time I reached the last line, I wasn’t even scared. Not really.

I was numb.

Like someone had handed me the diary of a lunatic and said, “Live by this or die screaming.”

It was unhinged. Unfollowable. Inhuman.

And yet?

I didn’t laugh.

Because I’ve seen things.

Things that defy explanation. Things that should not exist.

The freezer humming like it’s rewinding reality.

Shadows that slither against physics. 

The businessman with the dead eyes and the too-quiet shoes who shows up only to tack new horrors to the wall like corporate memos from hell.

This place stopped pretending to make sense the moment I locked that thing in the basement on my first shift.

And that’s why this list scared the hell out of me.

Because rules—real rules—can be followed. Survived.

But this? This was a warning stapled to the jaws of something that plans to bite.

I folded the page with shaking hands, slipped it into my pocket like a sacred text, and backed away from the front door.

That’s when it happened.

That... shift.

Like gravity blinked. Like the air twitched.

The front door creaked—not the usual automatic hiss and chime, but a long, slow swing like a church door opening at a funeral.

I turned.

And he walked in.

Black shoes, polished like obsidian.

A charcoal suit that clung to him like a shadow.

Tall. Too tall to be usual but not tall enough to be impossible. And sharp—like someone had sculpted him out of glass and intent.

He looked like he belonged on a red carpet or a Wall Street throne.

But in the flickering, jaundiced lights of Evergrove Market, he didn’t look human.

Not wrong, exactly. Just... off.

Like a simulation rendered one resolution too high. Like someone had described “man” to an alien artist and this was the first draft.

His smile was perfect.

Too perfect.

Practiced, like a knife learning to grin.

The temperature dropped the moment he stepped over the threshold.

He didn’t say a word. Just stared at me.

Eyes like static—glass marbles that shimmered with a color I didn’t have a name for. A color that probably doesn’t belong in this dimension.

And I knew.

Right then, I knew why the old man warned me. Why he flinched every time I brought up promotions.

Because this was the one who offers them.

From behind the counter, the old man appeared. Quiet. Like he’d been summoned by scent or blood or fate.

He didn’t look shocked.

Just... done. Like someone waiting for the train they swore they’d never board. He gave the tiniest nod. “This,” he said, voice barely above a whisper, “is the Night Manager.”

I stared.

The thing called the night manager stared back.

No blinking.

No breathing.

Just that flawless, eerie smile.

And then, in a voice that slid under my skin and curled against my spine, he said:

“Welcome to phase two.”

1m8yd6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1m8yd6z/is_there_ever_a_good_explanation_or_argument_that/,Is there ever a good explanation or argument that condones censorship in video games?,"I posted this kind of thing before in this sub-reddit and yet, I feel compelled to this again because it is really a heated thing amongst gamers whenever censorship is encountered in video games.

This is mostly in response to the recent censored or edited elements in the game Ready or Not which is a visceral game about police taking down terrorists and criminals.

There is a shooting in a shop and signs of torture or bystanders being afraid or even potentially shot if the player is not careful.

But many players gave a lot of negative reviews on Steam for the publishers' move to the console market of the game to censor or edit some elements of the game to appeal to the console market.

This is not new either.

Plenty of games have been censored in order to target a much wider audience.

For example, there is a time when Rainbow Six Siege wanted to expand to the Chinese market but in order to do this, the servers had to censor everything that had to do with skeletons, including on one of the Operators because there is a cultural taboo against death in China.

Many players hated this and this decision was revoked by Ubisoft.

And the most obvious example of censorship is of course that of Mortal Kombat.

When it was first introduced, many politicians were afraid of what the children might do or what the video games might try to condone because of such grotesque violence.

This is where the ESRB rating was first introduced and in versions of the game, the developers used sweat instead of blood to make the game more audience-friendly.

But the Mortal Kombat games are known for their violence and fatalities and one might say that some versions of this depicted violence was too far for some because it was reported that in Mortal Kombat 11, some developers had PTSD when they programmed certain grotesque violence in the fatalities.

So would this be a good excuse or a good argument for censorship in violence?

The puzzling question here is that in order to protect the mentality of gamers, over certain fears over trauma or what kind of incentive the video games might try to invoke on the player, some video games were censored or even banned.

This goes back to the same old argument about kind of message the gamers might digest from the video game like the possibility to commit violent acts or even terrorism.

This goes back to the school shooting in 1993 where the blame for the shooting was because the shooters were a fan of Doom.

But the irony is this.

Some video games were censored like the Manhunt games by Rockstar because people believed that it was too violent or too much of a message to do such things to innocent bystanders

The same thing went with the Hot Coffee episode in GTA San Andreas 

However, there is a double standard here.

Violence against Nazis or terrorists or soldiers are OK in the eyes of a lot of people. 

But showing a nude scene or more violence than 'necessary' crosses a red line.

This was a time where the video game Hatred was a topic of heated discussion because the protagonist was an anarchist who hated humanity 

But in the GTA games, the player can do pretty much anything or even overrun people or police officers.

This type of double standard is also seen in films and TV.

So, that being said, considering that censorship is a topic that plenty of gamers find to be unnecessary, especially when the items that are being censored are parts of what make the video games stand out (like Ready or Not where the players are literally fighting against terrorists, murders, gangsters and torturers), is there even a good argument that one can say that censorship is acceptable or necessary?

# How to start

# Step 1: Choose a gym

* Visit at the time you plan to work out.
* Ask about equipment, class schedules, trial passes, locker and shower access.
* Test the vibe: supportive vs. intimidating.

# Step 2: Prepare

* Bring: breathable clothes, athletic shoes, water bottle, towel, lock for locker.
* Research a simple workout or ask staff.
* Check peak hours to avoid crowds.

# Step 3: First visit

* Scan in at reception.
* Start with something easy: treadmill walk, basic machines, or beginner class.
* Ask for a demo if unsure how to use equipment.

# Step 4: Build a habit

* Aim for 2–3 times per week, 30–60 minutes each.
* Increase weight or time slowly.

# Gym etiquette in plain words

|Tip|Why it matters|
|:-|:-|

1m8yc5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenHorrorWriters/comments/1m8yc5x/night_shift_at_the_evergrove_market_day_1/,Night shift at the Evergrove Market - Day 1,"My first shift at the Evergroove Market started with a paper sign:

""HIRING!! Night Shift Needed – Evergrove Market""

The sign slapped against the glass door in the wind—bold, blocky letters that caught my eye mid-jog. I wasn’t out for exercise. I was trying to outrun the weight pressing on my chest: overdue rent, climbing student loans, and the hollow thud of every “We regret to inform you” that kept piling into my inbox.

I had a degree. Engineering, no less. Supposed to be a golden ticket. Instead, it bought me rejection emails and a gnawing sense of failure.

But what stopped me cold was the pay: $55 per hour.

I blinked, wondering if I’d read it wrong. No experience required. Night shift. Immediate start.

It sounded too good to be true—which usually meant it was. But I stood there, heart racing, rereading it like the words might disappear if I looked away. My bank account had dipped below zero three days ago. I’d been living on canned soup and pride.

I looked down at the bottom of the flyer and read the address aloud under my breath:

3921 Old Pine Road, California.

I sighed. New town, no family, no friends—just me, chasing some kind of fresh start in a place that didn’t know my name. It wasn’t ideal. But it was something. A flicker of hope. A paycheck.

By 10 p.m., I was there.

The store wasn’t anything spectacular. In fact, it was a lot smaller than I’d imagined.

“I don’t know why I thought this would be, like, a giant Walmart,” I muttered to myself, taking in the dim, flickering sign saying “Evergroove” and the eerie silence around me. There were no other shops in sight—just a lone building squatting on the side of a near-empty highway, swallowed by darkness on all sides.

It felt more like a rest stop for ghosts than a convenience store.

But I stepped forward anyway. As a woman, I knew the risk of walking into sketchy places alone. Every instinct told me to turn around. But when you’re desperate, even the strangest places can start to look like second chances.

The bell above the door gave a hollow jingle as I walked in. The store was dimly lit, aisles stretching ahead like crooked teeth in a too-wide grin. The reception counter was empty and the cold hit me like a slap.

Freezing.

Why was it so cold in the middle of July?

I rubbed my arms, breath fogging slightly as I looked around. That’s when I heard the soft shuffle of footsteps, followed by a creak.

Someone stepped out from the furthest aisle, his presence sudden and uncanny. A grizzled man with deep lines etched into his face like cracked leather.

“What d’you want?” he grunted, voice gravelly and dry.

“Uh… I saw a sign. Are you guys hiring?”

He stared at me too long. Long enough to make me question if I’d said anything at all.

Then he gave a slow nod and turned his back.

“Follow me,” he said, already turning down the narrow hallway. “Hope you’re not scared of staying alone.”

“I’ve done night shifts before.” I said recalling the call center night shift in high school, then retail during college. I was used to night shifts. They kept me away from home. From shouting matches. From silence I didn’t know how to fill.

The old man moved faster than I expected, his steps brisk and sure, like he didn’t have time to waste.

“This isn’t your average night shift,” he muttered, glancing back at me with a look I couldn’t quite read. Like he was sizing me up… or reconsidering something.

We reached a cramped employee office tucked behind a heavy door. He rummaged through a drawer, pulled out a clipboard, and slapped a yellowed form onto the desk.

“Fill this out,” he said, sliding the clipboard toward me. “If you’re good to start, the shift begins tonight.”

He paused—just long enough that I wondered if he was waiting for me to back out. But I didn’t.

I picked up the pen and skimmed the contract, the paper cold and stiff beneath my fingers. One line snagged my attention like a fishhook, Minimum term: One year. No early termination.

Maybe they didn’t want employees quitting after making a decent paycheck. Still, something about it felt off.

My rent and student loans weighed heavily on my mind. Beggars can’t be choosers and I would need at least six months of steady work just to get a handle on my debts.

But the moment my pen hit the paper, I felt it. A chill—not from the air, but from the room.

Like the store itself was watching me.

The old man didn’t smile or nod welcomingly—just gave me a slow, unreadable nod. Without a word, he took the form and slid it into a filing cabinet that looked like it hadn’t been opened in decades.

“You’ll be alone most of the time,” he said, locking the drawer with a sharp click. “Stock shelves. Watch the front if anyone shows up. The cameras are old, but they work. And read this.”

He handed me a laminated sheet of yellow paper. The title read: Standard Protocols.

I unfolded the sheet carefully, the plastic sticky against my fingers. The list was typed in faded black letters:

*Standard Protocols*

**1) Never enter the basement.**

**2) If you hear footsteps or whispers after midnight, do not respond or investigate.**

**3) Keep all exterior doors except the front door locked at all times—no exceptions.**

**4) Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

**5) If the lights flicker more than twice in a minute, stop all work immediately and hide until 1 a.m.**

**6) Do not exit the premises during your scheduled shift unless explicitly authorized.**

**7) Do not use your phone to call anyone inside the store—signals get scrambled.**

**8) If you feel watched, do not turn around or run. Walk calmly to the main office and lock the door until you hear footsteps walk away.**

**9) Under no circumstances touch the old cash register drawer at the front counter.**

**10) If the emergency alarm sounds, cease all tasks immediately and remain still. Do not speak. Do not move until the sound stops. And ignore the voice that speaks.**

I swallowed hard, eyes flicking back up to the old man.

“Serious business,” I said, sarcasm creeping into my voice. “What is this, a hazing ritual?”

He didn’t laugh. Didn’t even blink.

“If you want to live,” he said quietly, locking eyes with me, “then follow the rules.”

With that, he turned and left the office, glancing at his watch. “Your shift starts at 11 and ends at 6. Uniform’s in the back,” he added casually, as if he hadn’t just threatened my life.

I stood alone in the cold, empty store, the silence pressing down on me. The clock on the wall ticked loudly—10:30 p.m. Only thirty minutes until I had to fully commit to whatever this place was.

I headed toward the back room, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. The narrow hallway smelled faintly of old wood and something metallic I couldn’t place. When I found the uniform hanging on a rusty hook, I was relieved to see a thick jacket along with the usual store polo and pants.

Slipping into the jacket, I felt a small spark of comfort—like armor against the unknown. But the uneasy feeling didn’t leave. The protocols, the warning, the way the old man looked at me... none of it added up to a normal night shift.

I checked the clock again—10:50 p.m.

Time to face the night.

The first hour passed quietly. Just me, the distant hum of the overhead lights, and the occasional whoosh of cars speeding down the highway outside—none of them stopping. They never did. Not here.

I stocked shelves like I was supposed to. The aisles were narrow and dim, and the inventory was… strange. Too much of one thing, not enough of another. A dozen rows of canned green beans—but barely any bread. No milk. No snacks. No delivery crates in the back, no expiration dates on the labels.

It was like the stock just appeared.

And just as I was placing the last can on the shelf, the lights flickered once.

I paused. Waited. They flickered again.

Then—silence. That kind of thick silence that makes your skin itch.

And within that minute, the third flicker came.

This one lasted longer.

Too long.

The lights buzzed, stuttered, and dipped into full darkness for a breath… then blinked back to life—dim, as if even the store itself was tired. Or… resisting something.

I stood still. Frozen.

I didn’t know what I was waiting for—until I heard it.

A footstep. Just one. Then another. Slow. Heavy. Steady.

They weren’t coming fast, but they were coming.

Closer.

Whoever—or whatever—it was, it wasn’t in a rush. And it wasn’t trying to be quiet either.

My fingers had gone numb around the cart handle.

Rule Five.

**If the lights flicker more than twice in a minute, stop all work immediately and hide until 1 a.m.**

My heartbeat climbed into my throat. I let go of the cart and began backing away, moving as quietly as I could across the scuffed tile.

The aisles around me seemed to shift, shelves towering like skeletons under those flickering lights. Their shadows twisted across the floor, long and jagged, like they could reach out and pull me in.

My eyes searched the store. I needed to hide. Fast.

That’s when the footsteps—once slow and deliberate—broke into a full sprint.

Whatever it was, it had stopped pretending.

I didn’t think. I just ran, heart hammering against my ribs, breath sharp in my throat as I tore down the aisle, desperate for someplace—anyplace—to hide.

The employee office. The door near the stockroom. I remembered it from earlier.

The footsteps were right behind me now—pounding, frantic, inhumanly fast.

I reached the door just as the lights cut out completely.

Pitch black.

I slammed into the wall, palms scraping across rough plaster as I fumbled for the doorknob. 5 full seconds. That’s how long I was blind, vulnerable, exposed—my fingers clawing in the dark while whatever was chasing me gained ground.

I slipped inside the office, slammed the door shut, and turned the lock with a soft, deliberate click.

Darkness swallowed the room.

I didn’t dare turn on my phone’s light. Instead, I crouched low, pressing my back flat against the cold wall, every breath shaking in my chest. My heart thundered like a drumbeat in a silent theater.

I had no idea what time it was. No clue how long I’d have to stay hidden. I didn’t even know what was waiting out there in the dark.

I stayed there, frozen in the dark, listening.

At first, every creak made my chest seize. Every whisper of wind outside the walls sounded like breathing. But after a while... the silence settled.

And somewhere in that suffocating quiet, sleep crept in.

I must’ve dozed off—just for a moment.

Because I woke with a jolt as the overhead lights buzzed and flickered back on, casting a pale glow on the office floor.

I blinked hard, disoriented, then fumbled for my phone.

1:15 a.m.

“Damn it,” I muttered, voice hoarse and cracked.

Whatever the hell was going on in this store… I didn’t want any part of it.

But my train of thought was cut short by a soft ding from the front counter.

The bell.

The reception bell.

“Is anyone there?”

A woman’s voice—gentle, but firm. Too calm for this hour.

I froze, every instinct screaming for me to stay put.

But Rule Four whispered in the back of my mind:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

But it wasn’t 2 a.m. yet. So, against every ounce of better judgment, I pushed myself to my feet, knees stiff, back aching, and slowly crept toward the register.

And that’s when I saw her.

She stood perfectly still at the counter, hands folded neatly in front of her.

Pale as frost. Skin like cracked porcelain pulled from the freezer.

Her hair spilled down in heavy, straight strands—gray and black, striped like static on an old analog screen.

She wore a long, dark coat. Perfectly still. Perfectly pressed.

And she was smiling.

Polite. Measured. Almost mechanical.

But her eyes didn’t smile.

They just stared.

Something about her felt… wrong.

Not in the way people can be strange. In the way things pretend to be people.

She looked human.

Almost.

“Can I help you?” I asked, my voice shakier than I wanted it to be.

Part of me was hoping she wouldn’t answer.

Her smile twitched—just a little.

Too sharp. Too rehearsed.

“Yes,” she said.

The word hung in the air, cold and smooth, like it had been repeated to a mirror one too many times.

“I’m looking for something.”

I hesitated. “What… kind of something?”

She tilted her head—slowly, mechanically—like she wasn’t used to the weight of it.

“Do you guys have meat?” she asked.

The word hit harder than it should’ve.

Meat.

My blood ran cold. “Meat?,” I stammered. My voice thinned with each word.

She didn’t move. Didn’t blink.

Just stared.

“Didn’t you get a new shipment tonight?” she asked. Still calm. Still smiling.

And that’s when it hit me.

I had stocked meat tonight. Not in the aisle—but in the freezer in the back room. Two vacuum-sealed packs. No label. No origin. Just sitting there when I opened the store’s delivery crate…Two silent, shrink-wrapped slabs of something.

And that was all the meat in the entire store.

Just those two.

“Yes,” I said, barely louder than a whisper. “You can find it in the back…in the frozen section.”

She looked at me.

Not for a second. Not for ten.

But for two full minutes.

She didn’t move.

Didn’t blink.

Just stood there, that same polite smile frozen across a face that didn’t breathe… couldn’t breathe.

And then she said it.

“Thank you, Remi.”

My stomach dropped.

I never told her my name and my uniform didn't even have a nameplate.

But before I could react, she turned—slow, mechanical—and began walking down the back hallway.

That’s when I saw them.

Her feet.

They weren’t aligned with her body—angled just slightly toward the entrance, like she’d walked in backward… and never fixed it.

As she walked away—those misaligned feet shuffling against the linoleum—I stayed frozen behind the counter, eyes locked on her until she disappeared into the back hallway.

Silence returned, thick and heavy.

I waited. One second. Then ten. Then a full minute.

No sound. No footsteps. No freezer door opening.

Just silence.

I should’ve stayed behind the counter. I knew I should have. But something pulled at me. Curiosity. Stupidity. A need to know if those meat packs were even still there.

So I moved.

I moved down the hallway, one cautious step at a time.

The overhead lights buzzed softly—no flickering, just a steady, dull hum. Dimmer than before. Almost like they didn’t want to witness what was ahead.

The back room door stood open.

I hesitated at the threshold, heart hammering in my chest. The freezer was closed. Exactly how I’d left it. But she was gone. No trace of her. No footprints. No sound. Then I noticed it—one of the meat packets was missing. My stomach turned. And that’s when I heard it.

Ding. The soft chime of the front door bell. I bolted back toward the front, sneakers slipping on the tile. By the time I reached the counter, the door was already swinging shut with a gentle click. Outside? Empty parking lot. Inside? No one.

She was gone.

And I collapsed.

My knees gave out beneath me as panic took over, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might tear through my chest. My breath came in short gasps. Every instinct screamed Run, escape—get out.

But then I remembered Rule Six:

**Do not exit the premises during your scheduled shift unless explicitly authorized.**

I stared at the front door like it might bite me.

I couldn’t leave.

I was trapped.

My hands were trembling. I needed to regroup—breathe, think. I stumbled to the employee restroom and splashed cold water on my face, hoping it would shock my mind back into something resembling calm.

And that’s when I saw it.

In the mirror—wedged between the glass and the frame—was a folded piece of paper. Just barely sticking out.

I pulled it free and opened it.

Four words. Bold, smeared, urgent:

DONT ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

“What the hell…” I whispered.

I stepped out of the bathroom in a daze, the note still clutched in my hand, and made my way back to the stockroom, trying to focus on something normal. Sorting. Stacking. Anything to distract myself from whatever this was.

That’s when I saw it.

A stairwell.

Half-hidden behind a row of unmarked boxes—steps leading down. The hallway at the bottom stretched into a wide, dark tunnel that ended at a heavy iron door.

I felt my stomach twist.

The basement.

The one from Rule One:

**Never enter the basement.**

I shouldn’t have even looked. But I did. I peeked at the closed door.

And that’s when I heard it.

A voice. Muffled, desperate.

“Let me out…”

Bang.

“Please!” another voice cried, pounding the door from the other side.

Then another. And another.

A rising chorus of fists and pleas. The sound of multiple people screaming—screaming like their souls were on fire. Bloodcurdling, ragged, animalistic.

I turned and ran.

Bolted across the store, sprinting in the opposite direction, away from the basement, away from those voices. The farther I got, the quieter it became.

By the time I reached the far side of the store, it was silent again.

As if no one had ever spoken. As if no one had screamed. As if that door at the bottom of the stairs didn’t exist.

Then the bell at the reception desk rang.

Ding.

I froze.

Rule Four punched through my fog of fear:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

I slowly turned toward the clock hanging at the center of the store.

2:35 a.m.

Shit.

The bell rang again—harder this time. More impatient. I was directly across the store, hidden behind an aisle, far from the counter.

I crouched low and peeked through a gap between shelves.

And what I saw chilled me to the bone.

It wasn’t a person.

It was a creature—crouched on all fours, nearly six feet tall and hunched. Its skin was hairless, stretched and raw like sun-scorched flesh. Its limbs were too long. Its fingers curled around the edge of the counter like claws.

And its face…

It had no eyes.

Just a gaping, unhinged jaw—so wide I couldn’t tell if it was screaming or simply unable to close.

It turned its head in my direction.

It didn’t need eyes to know.

Then—

The alarm went off.

Rule Ten echoed in my head like a warning bell:

**If the emergency alarm sounds, cease all tasks immediately and remain still. Do not speak. Do not move until the sound stops. And ignore the voice that speaks.**

The sirens wailed through the store—shrill and disorienting. I froze, forcing every muscle in my body to go still. I didn’t even dare to blink.

And then, beneath the screech of the alarm, came the voice.

Low and Crooked. Not human.

“Remi… in Aisle 6… report to the reception.”

The voice repeated it again, warped and mechanical like it was being dragged through static.

“Remi in Aisle 6… come to the desk.”

I didn’t move.

Didn’t breathe.

But my eyes—my traitorous eyes—drifted upward. And what I saw made my stomach drop through the floor.

Aisle 6.

I was in Aisle 6.

The second I realized it, I heard it move.

The thing near the desk snapped its head and launched forward—charging down the store like it had been waiting for this cue. I didn’t wait. I didn't think. Just thought, “Screw this,” and ran.

The sirens only got louder. Harsher. Shadows started slithering out from between shelves, writhing like smoke with claws—reaching, grasping.

Every step I took felt like outrunning death itself.

The creature was behind me now, fast and wild, crashing through displays, howling without a mouth that ever closed. The shadows weren’t far behind—hungry, screaming through the noise.

I turned sharply toward the back hallway, toward the only place left: the stairwell.

I shoved the basement door open and slipped behind it at the last second, flattening myself behind the frame just as the creature skidded through.

It didn’t see me.

It didn’t even hesitate.

It charged down the stairs, dragging the shadows with it into the dark.

I slammed the door shut and twisted the handle.

Click.

It auto-locked. Thank God.

The pounding began immediately.

Fists—or claws—beating against the other side. Screams—inhuman, layered, dozens of voices all at once—rose from beneath the floor like a chorus of the damned.

I collapsed beside the door, chest heaving, soaked in sweat. Every nerve in my body was fried, my thoughts scrambled and spinning.

I sat there for what felt like forever—maybe an hour, maybe more—while the screams continued, until they faded into silence.

Eventually, I dragged myself to the breakroom.

No sirens. No voices. Just the hum of the fridge and the buzz of old lights.

I made myself coffee with shaking hands, not because I needed it—because I didn’t know what else to do.

I stared at the cup like it might offer answers to questions I was too tired—and too scared—to ask.

All I could think was:

God, I hope I never come back.

But even as the thought passed through me, I knew it was a lie.

The contract said one year.

One full year of this madness.

And there was no getting out.

By the time 6 a.m. rolled around, the store had returned to its usual, suffocating quiet—like nothing had ever happened.

Then the bell above the front door jingled.

The old man walked in.

He paused when he saw me sitting in the breakroom. Alive.

“You’re still here?” he asked, genuinely surprised.

I looked up, dead-eyed. “No shit, Sherlock.”

He let out a low chuckle, almost impressed. “Told you it wasn’t your average night shift. But I think this is the first time a newbie has actually made it through the first night.”

“Not an average night shift doesn’t mean you die on the clock, old man,” I muttered.

He brushed off the criticism with a shrug. “You followed the rules. That’s the only reason you’re still breathing.”

I swallowed hard, my voice barely steady. “Can I quit?”

His eyes didn’t even flicker. “Nope. The contract says one year.”

I already knew that but it still stung hearing it out loud.

“But,” he added, casually, “there’s a way out.”

I looked up slowly, wary.

“You can leave early,” he said, “if you get promoted.”

That word stopped me cold.

DON’T ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

The note in the bathroom flashed through my mind like a warning shot.

“Promotion?” I asked, carefully measuring the word.

“Not many make it that far,” he said, matter-of-fact. No emotion. No concern. Like he was stating the weather.

I didn’t respond. Just stared.

He slid an envelope across the table.

Inside: my paycheck.

$500.

For one night of surviving hell.

“You earned it,” he said, standing. “Uniform rack’ll have your size ready by tonight. See you at eleven.”

Then he walked out. Calm. Routine. Like we’d just finished another late shift at a grocery store.

But nothing about this job was normal.

And if “not many make it to the promotion,” that could only mean one thing.

Most don’t make it at all.

I pocketed the check and stepped out into the pale morning light.

The parking lot was still. Too still.

I walked to my car, every step echoing louder than it should’ve. I slid into the driver’s seat, hands gripping the wheel—knuckles white.

I sat there for a long time, engine off, staring at the rising sun.

Thinking.

Wondering if I’d be stupid enough to come back tomorrow.

And knowing, deep down…

So in 2018 I was told very briefly I had my first cold sore. I didn’t really have education on it but have been lucky I have the big initial outbreak and it took until 1.5 years ago burning my lip with coffee to get my second. But.. before my oral outbreak I got my first gential outbreak that was swabbed and said it was HSV2 but I read it could be false (in my denial) and got type tested and only was postive for HSV1 we waiting 8 weeks or more and retested me and only HSV1 

I am now living in constant fear, scrubbing my hands until I get eczema and I don’t interact normal with my kids or fiance anymore. 

I read and was told that having the same type in both areas wasnt a thing yet here I am. Idk how I gave it to myself without being careless with an outbreak but I haven’t had those in years and always cautious if something orally seemed abnormal. 

My fiance years before him and I got together, went to the VA for a skin issue on his privates and they said it’s friction. For some reason I’m more comforted getting it from him being misdiagnosed then unknowingly by myself since my oral is very mild and my genital is still new and idk how to navigate any of this. 


Can someone have some guidance and maybe some comfort they can share so I can try to be okay again?

1m8yab5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1m8yab5/find_out_if_the_hario_v60_pour_over_coffee_maker/,Find Out if the Hario V60 Pour Over Coffee Maker Delivers Cafe Quality,"Brewing coffee is probably one of my favorite daily rituals, and the Hario V60, model V60, has quickly become my go-to coffee-making companion. Coming from someone who has tried numerous pour-over systems in the past, this set truly stands out! The moment I unboxed the kit, I could feel the attention to quality. It includes everything you need—a ceramic dripper, a glass coffee server, a coffee scoop, and even 100 Hario V60 disposable paper filters. It’s like they knew just how much I dislike having to buy several components separately. With a professional yet simple setup, all you need is ground coffee, hot water, and this gadget.  

**Striking Design and Build Quality**

The ceramic material of the dripper was the first thing that caught my eye. Aside from its sleek and minimal look, the build quality is superb. It’s not just about being aesthetically pleasing; the ceramic not only retains heat well but also maintains the integrity of the flavors during the brewing process. The cone-shaped design and ridges allow the coffee to flow evenly, creating that perfect bloom I’m always aiming for. As someone who’s clumsy before their first coffee of the day, I appreciate how sturdy and durable this set feels. 

**Ease of Use and Learning Curve**

Getting the hang of the Hario V60 system was surprisingly straightforward. Though manual brewing can seem intimidating for beginners, the included starter kit simplified things. Even my friend, who’s new to pour-over coffee, managed to brew a great cup after a quick walkthrough. The coffee scoop ensures you measure the exact amount, and the filters fit perfectly, leaving no room for accidental spills. I will admit, mastering the perfect pour takes a bit of practice. Once you have the water flow technique down though, you’ll feel like a barista in your own kitchen.

**Check [Hario V60 price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b01l6ocxas/)**

**Flavor Like No Other**

Brewing with this kit gives you complete control over the flavor profile of your coffee. Changing water temperatures or grind sizes adjusts the taste beautifully. I tested it with a variety of medium and dark coffee beans, and the results were consistently rich and flavorful. Unlike coffee machines that can often over-percolate, this manual pour-over method ensures there’s no bitterness in the cup. Whether I’m in the mood for a quick pick-me-up or a slow, Sunday morning brew ritual, it nails it every time.

**Positives**

- Exceptional build quality with durable ceramic and heatproof glass
- Comes as a complete set, reducing the hassle of buying separate items  
- Produces rich, nuanced coffee with total control of the brewing process
- Compact and stylish design that enhances any kitchen  
- Filters are well-made and fit perfectly  

**Negatives**

- Slight learning curve for beginners to achieve consistent results  
- Filters are proprietary, so restocking requires planning  
- Ceramic construction could feel heavy for some users  

**Competing Brands**

Comparing the Hario V60 to others on the market, such as the Chemex and Kalita Wave, was interesting. While Chemex offers a larger brewing capacity and a more elegant design, I found its filters to be pricier and less beginner-friendly. The Kalita Wave, on the other hand, has a flat-bottom style that’s excellent for evenly extracted coffee, but it doesn’t allow the same level of control over the pour as the Hario V60. If precision, efficiency, and a compact form are priorities for you, this coffee dripper has a strong edge over its rivals.

**Cost Efficiency**

For the performance and build quality, this product offers fantastic value. Compared to investing in machines that cost three to four times as much, this set provides a more personalized brewing experience without breaking the bank. It’s a small price to pay for what can only be described as coffee nirvana right in the comfort of your home. Plus, the included 100 filters save you a fair amount initially, so all that’s left is picking your favorite beans.

this'll probably get taken down by mods, but that's fine. i just want to say my piece - it'll help me feel better. enjoy being my catharsis.

what's the point of this sub if people instantly piss and moan every time someone posts something?  
someone shares a gameplay clip or a cool move - it gets trashed. they're told it's superfluous, been done, or too irrelevant to post.

or someone does a 'rate me' post - they're immediately shit on. and not in the fun, sarcastic way where everyone throws out fake rankings and jokes around. it's just real negativity.

and god forbid someone wants to complain about teammates or opponents. the tiny group of active users shuts it down instantly.

and that's fine - if that's the standard here, cool.

but then seriously, what’s the point of this sub if:

* sharing clips gets trashed *(i'm guilty of this sometimes too - fair's fair, but the point still stands)*
* asking for feedback gets mocked or dismissed
* venting or asking legit questions gets labeled as whining

you ask something about the game, people pile on with ""how could you not know this"" like you're dumb.  
you complain about the game? smacked down.

i get that maybe the mod vision is some curated ultra-positive space. but that’s not what most people come here for.  
people want to vent about garbage teammates, or ask “is this a cheat?” (spoiler: no, it's a glitch, reload the game).

and yeah - let’s be honest here.  
part of this is me just wishing this sub had more drama.  
i want to see the flame wars. i want to see people exposing toxic pieces of shit (with censored names, fine, sure - whatever).  
maybe even get a bit of vigilante justice for someone if i beat them - or have to admit that i'm trash at this game when i lose.

it’d be fun. it’d be real.  
it’d reflect the actual game experience more than the squeaky-clean curated positivity people pretend they want.

anyway. just typing. it's 8:30am, i don't work today, and i need coffee.",3,1753447725.0,RLSideSwipe,2,0.67,False

1m8y97s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1m8y97s/aitah_for_choosing_to_go_nc_with_my_mum_because/,AITAH for choosing to go NC with my mum because she disagrees with my partner and I having a child?,"Hiiiiii Potatoes, 

This is my first time posting ever on reddit. Always being a silent follower. And yes, I am Australian so spelling mum like this is correct for me!

I 30F and my wife 32F have been married for 5 years. We have been in a great place financially with good careers, earning a good income etc. We decided we wanted to start a family 1.5 years ago. As we are a same sex couple, we knew that we were limited on options and decided to go down the fertility route. Great! We knew we could afford it and decided it was what was best for us together as a couple. 

My wife and I agreed she would be the one to get pregnant. For context, I found out when I was 18 that I could not have children. This plus myself earning the highest income made the most sense for us on her becoming pregnant and I could work while she is on Mat Leave (obviously still being present to help with any children we have and her recovery, and any other support). We discussed for a long time (6 months) because she wanted to make sure I would be okay not going through pregnancy etc. I assured her in every aspect that I have come to terms with the fact I won’t be able to bare children and I cannot wait to help her through the process as it’s OUR baby, not just hers. 

My mum and I have always been best friends. I am the only daughter and the oldest with 3 x brother siblings. We’ve always had such a close relationship and she has always been my rock. Never had an issue with me being gay and always was my biggest supporter. My wife and I explained to her when we met for coffee every weekend like we always did and expressed our desire to have a family. She was all on board and supportive as usual. We were 9 months in with many unsuccessful rounds and it had been heartbreaking for us. Finally, at round 6 we fell pregnant. We were so excited we couldn’t wait and obviously with me being so close to my mum I called her to tell her the good news. She seemed very excited on the phone and I didn’t notice any behavioural changes. 

It was one my brothers birthdays, and every year for each of us children my mum loves to cook us our favourite meal or meal of choice and the whole family gets together, drinks and catches up as we don’t all see each other often. My mum loves to drink, and I mean, too much to the point she goes through all the stages - happy, hip hop dancer, emotional, crying, sloppy, passed out on the floor. Generally, I am the one always picking her up and putting her to bed. When she gets in this state, her true feelings about anything just blurts out. 

This particular night, she was quite drunk and decided to site my wife and I down while skulking many beers stating how she is so sad that her only daughter is not going to give her grandchildren. She had a hysterectomy about a year ago and kept saying how she wanted to give me her reproductive system so I could have my own. For context, my fallopian tubes are blocked and need to be removed. I am in the process of trying to get a hysterectomy myself. She genuinely believes that if I had accepted having surgery to remove my “parts” and transplant hers into me I would be better off and not relying on my wife to have children that are not related to her. She also whispered to my wife whilst I was inside talking to my Dad that she did not believe any children my wife had would be her grandchildren as they are not blood related. My wife did not tell me until we were driving home. 

Firstly, I was furious that she has not come to me at any point before even considering to have children, knowing I could not have any at 18 years olds. Secondly, any children my wife has, WILL BE my child PERIOD.  I don’t care if there is any relation to me. That will be our baby and I will love them no matter what. Thirdly, this is a side I’ve never seen of my mum and I am still to this day shocked she acted this way. I since had a conversation with her about it expressing my frustration and explaining I will be a mum regardless of DNA. She completely did a 180 and said she didn’t mean it and was sorry. I accepted her apology and assumed this was just poor behaviour from drinking. I did start to slowly stop confiding in her and talking every second day and even reduced my weekly weekend coffee catch ups to once a fortnight or even monthly. 

Then, another brother’s birthday came about 3 months later. Same story, dinner, drinks good time until…….she decided to start expressing how she is upset that my wife is the one pregnant and I am not and same old spiel again, and again. This time she also said my dad felt the same way and would not accept the baby into the family. I confronted my dad and asked if this was how he felt, he immediately became offended that I would assume he ever felt this way. Which is not the case at all. I then confronted my mum with dad in the same room and she denied immediately about saying anything of the sort. I called b*llsh*t grabbed my wife and left. 

She since has messaged asking my we decided to leave when we were having a good time. I sent her a very long message stating how I felt and that if she did not see our children as her family then she won’t be apart of our family. I never received a response and I decided to go completely NC. 

2 months later (now), she reached out to me saying “Hi my love, I hope you are doing okay since you won’t talk to me”.  Mate! When I saw that message I was FURIOUS! I just copied the original long message I sent before that had no response and resent it. And didn’t get a response for the second time. I gave up! Why am I going to try with someone who ignores my feelings and just wants to brush everything under the rug and have no accountability. F**k that! She sent another message 2 days ago saying I am being awful for not talking to her since we were inseparable. I just can’t deal with it anymore. 

So Charlotte, reddit potatoes, AITAH for deciding to no longer have contact with my mum? 

Also to note, the baby we found out we were pregnant with unfortunately we lost not long after the second dinner. We are still ongoing on our fertility journey hoping for a good outcome. 

Appreciate any advice going forward as I do miss having my mum there for support and sometimes feel like I should give in to have that relationship back. 

Thanks for reading! I feel better for getting it all out at least.

I also gave up coffee and dropped 10 pounds.

In July, I was working out at the gym and began to pass out. It was terrifying. I couldn’t make it out the door, so I sat on a machine and signaled for help. Soon, I was loaded into an ambulance and taken to a hospital. Generally, I work out twice per week, and I have never had anything like this happened to me before.

At the hospital, I was diagnosed with low blood pressure and possible dehydration. I was held overnight for observation, all of my blood pressure readings were very low. 

At the hospital, the doctor said it might be my combination of metoprolol and alfuzosin, which he said could also lower my blood pressure. 

My question is, has anyone here ever experienced anything like this before? How normal/abnormal is it to go from HBP to LBP in three months?

My cardiologist wants me to continue taking the metoprolol and speak to my GP about discontinuing alfuzosin. I agree, but would also like to reduce the metoprolol. 

Thanks in advance for your responses.

1m8y4x1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Polkadot/comments/1m8y4x1/what_do_you_think_should_we_push_ink_or_move_with/,What do you think: Should we push Ink or move with solidity?,"Hi Everyone,

  
ink! is Polkadot’s native smart contract language, built in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly. It’s powerful, secure, and tightly integrated into the Polkadot ecosystem.

But let’s be honest - ink! is still far from being a mainstream choice for most developers.

Meanwhile, Solidity dominates the Web3 space with its huge developer base, mature tooling, and wide adoption. So, how can ink! catch up and possibly go beyond?

I believe Ink! doesn’t need to replace Solidity.

Instead, it should position itself as the better long-term choice for serious Web3 builders. But that requires effort from the community, the ecosystem teams, and the developer tooling space.

Here’s a breakdown of why ink! is worth pushing and how we can actually do it.

# Why ink! Deserves a Bigger Role

1. **Speed and Security**

* ink! compiles to WebAssembly, which is faster and more efficient.
* Built on Rust, ink! benefits from a strong type system and memory safety, leading to fewer vulnerabilities.

1. **Tightly Integrated with Polkadot**

* ink! contracts can interact with pallets, access native staking and governance mechanisms, and use cross-chain messaging via XCM.
* It’s designed from the ground up for the Polkadot ecosystem.

1. **Async and Multi-Chain Friendly**

* Unlike Solidity, ink! can support asynchronous execution and cross-chain logic natively.
* This is a major advantage as Polkadot moves toward a multi-core, elastic scaling future.

1. **Built for Long-Term Composability**

* ink! contracts are modular and extensible. Developers can create complex systems that go beyond the simple app logic.

# What’s Holding ink! Back?

1. **Rust Learning Curve**

* Rust is a powerful but complex language, especially for devs coming from JavaScript or Python.
* But here’s the thing - Solana uses Rust too, and they’ve succeeded in onboarding thousands of developers. So this is a solvable problem, not an excuse.

1. **Tooling Gaps**

* `cargo-contract` works, but it’s not as beginner-friendly or powerful as Hardhat or Foundry.
* Testing, debugging, deployment, and simulations still need to improve.

1. **Lack of Ecosystem Libraries**

* Solidity devs have access to OpenZeppelin, Chainlink, and countless verified templates.
* ink! needs a similar ecosystem of plug-and-play components.

1. **Poor Visibility**

* Very few public case studies or flagship apps using ink!.
* Many Polkadot developers don’t even consider ink! when building.

# How We Can Push ink! Forward

1. **Improve Dev Experience**

* Invest in better tools like debuggers, gas analyzers, and live testnets.
* Create easy-to-use starter kits (`scaffold-ink`, `create-ink-app`).
* Launch a browser-based IDE (like Remix) for ink! with templates and deploy buttons.

1. **Build Ecosystem Libraries**

* Fund the development of common ink! modules (e.g. token standards, DEX contracts, DAOs).
* Port popular Solidity contracts to ink! with testing and docs.

1. **Make Learning Easy**

* Publish guides like “Solidity to ink! for Beginners” or “ERC-20 in ink!”.
* Run workshops and tutorials targeted at Solidity devs.
* Create short YouTube series, Twitter threads, and GitHub examples.

1. **Highlight Real Projects**

* Feature teams building real apps with ink! and how it helped them.
* Turn successful stories into content: blogs, videos, talks.

1. **Run ink!-Focused Grants & Hackathons**

* Offer funding and visibility for ink!-only dApps.
* Include ink! in every Polkadot hackathon, with mentorship and beginner tracks.

# Tools and Initiatives Available for ink! Today

* **Ink!ubator**: a bounty program to further the ink! smart contracting ecosystem.
* **Pop CLI**: Alternative to `cargo-contract`.
* **ink!athon**: A full-stack boilerplate for ink! smart contracts with frontend integration.
* **VS Code Extension (ink! Analyzer)**: Created by David Semakula, offers inline diagnostics, quick fixes, autocompletions, and inline documentation for ink!.
* **zink!**: A macro library that simplifies ink! development and reduces boilerplate code.
* **use-inkathon**: A React hook and utility toolkit to interact with Substrate-based networks and ink! smart contracts from your frontend.
* **DRink!**: Developed by Aleph Zero, it allows full local contract development without a running node.

# Long-Term Vision

The future of smart contracts is multi-chain, parallel, and high-performance, all areas where ink! shines.

Ink! can power the next generation of Web3:

* async dApps
* trust-minimized bridges
* cross-chain DAOs
* interoperable games
* modular identity frameworks

To get there, we need to invest now in developer tools, content, and community. We don’t need to replace Solidity. We need to show that ink! is a better option for those who want to build faster, more secure, and future-ready smart contracts.

By investing in better tools, education, and awareness, we can help ink! reach the level of adoption it truly deserves.

This is not just about developer choice. It’s about building the kind of smart contract ecosystem that Polkadot was designed for.

# Who Am I?

I’m Abinash, and I’ve been building Web3 products since around 2021–2022. I’ve worked with Solidity on EVM, Rust on Solana, and ink! on Polkadot, building everything from consumer apps to developer tools.

**Current Project:**

* **Dotme** – a frictionless tipping platform on Polkadot (think Buy Me a Coffee, but powered by DOT).
* **Arbit** – a tool for collecting verified user feedback and testimonials directly from wallets interacting with Web3 products. (Shipping soon!)
* [https://x.com/implabinash](https://x.com/implabinash)
* [implabinash (Abinash) · GitHub](https://github.com/implabinash)

**Let’s make ink! a first-class citizen of the Web3 world. Not as a niche language, but as the go-to choice for serious builders in the Polkadot ecosystem and beyond.**

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts, experiences, and ideas. Have you tried ink!? What helped? What stopped you? What should we build next?",9,1753447355.0,Polkadot,1,0.92,False

One example:  My kitchen lights run off of two smart plugs.   They have for well over 10 years.   Every morning a routine runs and they are on when I come down to make coffee in the morning.  

When I want them off I simple say ""Hey Google, turn off kitchen!""  

Last night that didn't work.  Tried to turn on my dining room and only one light came on.  

In the home app I am able to turn on all the dining room light by selecting the light group under 'dining room'.  I am also able to turn off the two kitchen switches in the app.   When I ask for my living to turn on only one light responds.  In the app the entire light group turns on when I select it.  

All of a sudden Google Assistant seemed to forget I have rooms.   I have also been getting more and more 'that device hasn't been set up...'   A moment later, it works fine.  ",3,1753447353.0,googlehome,0,1.0,False

Castle 2035

Kate was 57 years old and had become a senator. Her passions had become environmentalism, justice for the oppressed, and justice for children.
Castle was 64 years old and, after writing two magnificent, critically acclaimed novels: “A Complicated Love” and ""A Happiness Achieved,"" a two-part story heavily inspired—as you might expect—by his personal life with Kate, he had returned to his first love : crime fiction. His new opus, ""Human Heat,“ was heavily inspired by the ”Shauna Taylor"" case, one of the rare cases where Castle and Beckett each stuck to their own line and where the solution left a lot of blanks, at least in Castle's mind.
It was September, a Saturday, and Castle was at a book signing in his own city, New York, at the Stand bookstore in Columbus. A man who had been waiting in line for a while handed him his book and asked him to write the following inscription on the endpaper:
“For Paul, whose life I saved.”
Castle, perplexed at the time, looked up and saw in front of him a man in his forties with brown hair, a small mustache attached to a beard, glasses, and a mischievous expression.

(Paul): You don't recognize me, do you?
(Rick): I have to say I don't. Sorry. You don't remind me of anyone I know.
(Paul): And yet you did save my life... Maybe with my name... my name is Paul Deschile. Castle leaps out of his chair and says :
(Rick): Oh, what a fantastic surprise! Of course I know who you are. And besides, you're in my book!
(Paul): Indeed, I realized that when I read it. That's why I insisted on coming to this signing session in person, and I also wanted to take this opportunity to thank you once again for what you and Detective Beckett have done for me.
(Rick) :That's fantastic. Give me a few minutes to finish my signing, and I'm yours for... whatever you want.
(Paul) : That sounds pretty good to me. I have a little time today, and I'm in New York for two days because I'm giving a lecture tomorrow afternoon at the Coney Island Amphitheater on energy in sustainable development.
(Rick) : So, it's decided, and I'm kidnapping you to bring you to our home, just after this session is over.
(Paul) : That works for me, but I'm going to make a couple of phone calls to reassure everyone and say that I haven't yet fallen prey to a dangerous criminal! 
(Rick) : And I'm also going to make two or three phone calls to make this evening an unforgettable moment.

While Paul Deschile called his superiors and colleagues, Castle called his wife between signings and asked her to do something for him, no questions asked. Kate had long trusted her husband completely, but that didn't make her any more reassured. 
Castle added : I'm bringing someone extremely important home and trying to make sure our three children have no plans tonight. Make sure the guest room is ready, and I'll arrange for some items from Remy's to be delivered. Also, get some good wine and chill some champagne.
Kate replied : You're lucky I'm home and, for once, relaxed. I'll do what you ask. Don't forget to let me know when you plan to arrive with your ""special guest star."" I guess there's no point in asking in advance, who knows?
(Rick) : Indeed, but you won't be disappointed, and neither will the children. 
(Kate) : Should we dress to the nines?
(Rick) : No, the dress code is cool.
(Kate) : So, see you later. I love you.
(Rick) : I love you too.

Castle finished his signing session with his head in the clouds, almost automatically signing the last copies presented to him. He stood up, joined Paul, and said : 
Paul, I want you to know my family. Of course, you know Kate Beckett, my wife now, and also a senator, but we also have three wonderful children, Lily, Jake, and Reece, who will be so happy to meet you and, above all, to discuss your education, your work, and your future prospects. They have long been, thanks to their mother, very close to nature and the environment, and it will be a wonderful meeting. And it will be an opportunity to talk again about that timeless moment when my wife and I argued about Simon Doyle. It's going to be magnificent. Do you remember Simon Doyle? I think you only caught a glimpse of him at the police station and you've probably forgotten his face.
(Paul) : No, I remember him very well, and in fact, he's in your book too.
(Rick) : Right! Let's take my car and get home quickly.
Castle's eyes twinkled, and Paul watched with a fond expression. Castle called Remy's place with the order and called Kate back to tell her they'd be there in 20 minutes, depending on traffic, and that Remy's order was on its way.

Castle opened the door and exclaimed : It's us! 
He was then very surprised to see his entire family on the couches facing each other around the coffee table, including Alexis, whom Kate had called because her presence was always helpful when Castle decided to do something strange. Her husband, David, had preferred to stay home with his children.
Everyone shouted ""Welcome!"" together to the incoming guest, but the smiles faded as no one recognized this last-minute guest. For a moment, there was even an awkward silence.
Kate broke the silence by saying : Come on, come on, let's at least give this person a chance to introduce themselves.
Castle retorted : Wait, you're all sitting around like we're going to play, so let's play! You're going to play ""who am I?"" Our guest and I will give you clues by answering your questions. 
Paul gave Castle a knowing wink and said : Fine by me, I agree.
Rick relieved his guest of his coat, and the two sat down in armchairs around the table.
 Jake was the first to ask Paul a question :
Hello, I'm Jake Castle, and do I know you?
(Paul) : No, I'm sorry, but we're going to get to know each other.
Reece chimed in second:
I'm Reece Castle, his twin brother. I don't suppose we know each other either?
(Paul) : Indeed, Reece, we don't know each other yet.
The doorbell rang, Rick answered it and retrieved Remy's order. He went to the kitchen where his wife joined him.
(Kate): What are you playing? If no one knows this person except you, everyone's going to get bored quickly.
(Rick): Trust me, you're going to love this evening. Let's prepare the meal together, if you don't mind, and I'll put some champagne glasses on the coffee table.
Fleur spoke:
Hello, I'm Fl..., uh, Lily Castle, and I don't suppose I know you either.
(Paul) : Right. This is the first time I've seen you, but I'm delighted to meet you.
Fleur blushed and didn't dare say another word.
Alexis, who also didn't recognize the guest, ventured a question:
Are you famous?
(Paul) Well, in one very specific field, I think I am indeed famous.
(Reece): Known like our father?
(Paul): Oh no, certainly not that famous!
Castle gave a knowing wink of thanks for having made him look good to his children.
(Reece): You don't look like a trendy singer or the best basketball player in the NBA. So I guess your field is science. Judging by your very proper attire and neat appearance, I deduce that you're not a mathematician. I'd opt for physics or life sciences. Am I wrong?
(Paul): Yes, that's right. Bravo, I am indeed a physicist.
Kate and Rick looked at each other, amazed and full of love for this prodigious son with a supernatural and, no doubt, a touch of genetic talent.
(Jake): And since our father knows you, it's clear you helped him with his research for a book.
(Paul): Well, I'd say it's quite the opposite: your father helped me a lot to become who I am today, but my story has a lot to do with his latest book.
(Jake): Did you know our mother too before coming to our house?
(Paul) : Yes, Jake, I met her at the same time as your father.
(Kate): I thought your face wasn't completely unfamiliar to me. Was it during a case?
(Paul): Yes, a very special case in which you saved my life. At that time, your name was still Kate Beckett and you were a detective at the 12th Precinct.
(Kate): I know who you are! Your face has aged, but so has ours, unfortunately. You were very young then. It was 2014, and I believe your name is Paul Deschile.
(Paul): I'm clued in. Well done, Ms. Castle. Good memory.
(Reece): Paul Deschile? The one about tachyons? The energy shield? Alternative energy? You're probably famous! You're regularly on the cover of scientific journals and you're a real whistleblower when it comes to the environment.
(Paul): Well done, Reece, I'm simply amazed at how much you know about my work.
(Reece): That's because I love doing research like my dad. It's very inspiring.
Rick had tears in his eyes, and Kate couldn't hide them anymore. Rick then said : Now that you know our guest, it's time to honor him. To your glasses, and let's raise our glasses to Paul Deschile!
To Paul!
Everyone took a sip of champagne, including the children, this time exceptionally, and began to nibble at Rémy's delicacies.
The children continued with the water, and Kate brought a nice bottle of Sancerre for Rick and his guest, but also a little for herself and Alexis.
(Jake) : Dad, now we need to know the end of the story, and especially how you and Mom saved his life. The real story. Not the one in your new book that you're keeping us from reading because we're not grown-up enough, even though everyone here knows that at our age, you were no saint.
(Rick): Jake, I think you're being very disrespectful to your old father, and if you want to hear this story, I suggest you keep your voice down.
Sorry, Dad, I was just basing it on what Mom told us.
What? Rebel Kate told you secrets about me? Oh, good job, you're better served by your enemies.
Fleur glared at her brother, and an icy silence spread throughout the room.
Rick and Kate burst out laughing, and the evening's good mood was instantly restored.
Rick said : Don't you want to ask Paul some questions instead?
(Jake): No, only afterward. We want to hear the story of the investigation!
(Paul): Mr. Castle, I'd like to hear it too, to see if your book is accurate...
(Rick): Well, I suggest, for once, that Mom tell the story. That way, no one can accuse me of tinkering with the truth.
(Kate) : Are you sure?
(Rick) : Absolutely.
(Kate) : Okay, but you'll be the one serving.
Kate went and stood between her twins and began her story.
(Kate) : It all started, if I remember correctly, in 2014 with a phone call to the police station from someone reporting a rather terrifying murder (sorry, but I won't go into details, I'll just say that there was torture before the murder) and this witness had seen the possible murderer flee. He was wearing a hoodie, but the witness was able to draw a composite sketch of his face. The victim's name was Shauna Taylor. She was a probation officer by trade, and we started, as we always do in an investigation, by contacting her close family. Shauna no longer had her parents and since the recent death of her father, she only had one half-brother, Professor Wickfield. We went to meet him and he told us that the last time they spoke, his half-sister had told him about her anxiety about a man who was always following her, who was harassing her, telling her that she had to believe him, that billions of lives were at stake.
After some time, she called the police, and the man was arrested and taken to a mental institution for evaluation. We got his photo, and it matched our composite sketch exactly. He had to be our murderer. I then asked for the medical records with the videos of the psychiatric evaluation of this individual who still stubbornly refused to give his name. Your father and I watched the video and saw this man screaming like a savage, saying that he had to be released immediately so that he could save Shauna Taylor and thus save billions of people. And that if he wasn't released immediately, we would all die. His only explanation was that he had been sent from the future and that the only clue he had was: 12.58. I remember at that precise moment, I thought to myself that we were dealing with a psychopath and that your father, with that sneering look you know him for, whispered in my ear: ""This is officially my favorite case."" I immediately asked to bring this individual to the station, willingly or not, but he was released after his evaluation. Just as I was about to put out an APB, Kevin, Lieutenant Ryan, informed us that the witness from the beginning had seen the man in question again at the crime scene and that he was still there. Ryan and Esposito apprehended him and took him to the station in handcuffs. Castle and I (she had just said Castle again as she had done back then and it brought a knowing smile to Rick's face) questioned him. We already knew his name: Simon Doyle, but the rest was no clearer than on the asylum video: he came from 2035, so from today, as a temporal anthropologist, to prevent something from being changed in 2014, in order to avoid a catastrophe that would kill billions of people. He was supposed to go to Shauna Taylor's house to protect her, but when he arrived, she was already dead. He had just returned to the crime scene to look for clues with a kind of toy he called his temporal tracker. As usual, he told us that we had to release him because time was against us, that we were on the same side, and that he had to find Shauna's murderer very quickly. At that point, Esposito came to confirm to me that the only fingerprints found at the crime scene were Doyle's. I had Doyle locked in a cell and asked a police psychologist to come and do another evaluation. I remember thinking I was going crazy and I also remember saying to your father, ""For the sake of our future, tell me you don't believe this individual!"" Your father understood very quickly that he shouldn't contradict me at that moment and he simply said: ""No, but you have to admit that he is very convincing when he tells his story!"". When the psychologist, Dr. Silverman, arrived, I told him where Doyle was, but he had vanished from his cell. I still remember saying: ""But where did he go?"" and your father replied, smiling: ""It's not where?, but when!"" I was seething inside because I saw your father laughing and I had to find a Cartesian excuse for what had just happened. At that moment, the only one I could find was that a paperwork error had been made at the police station and that he had been released by mistake and that everyone was now trying to save their own asses. Your father knew that I didn't like the excuse I had just given, but I was on edge. So he said kindly, ""It's plausible. The chances are very slim, but it's plausible."" I love your father because he knows how to push me, but he also knows when not to push me too far.

Then Lanie asked me to meet her at the morgue because she'd found a lipstick stain on our victim's neck. Shauna's half-brother confirmed over the phone that she was indeed a lesbian, but that she wasn't seeing anyone at the time. Ryan, for his part, had gone through her credit card accounts and noted that she'd been at George's Bar the night of her murder and had paid for two drinks. There was a hotel across the street from George's Bar that fortunately had security cameras. Thanks to the videos, we were able to see the woman who was with Shauna, and we went back to question the bartender with the photo, hoping for an identification. The waitress confirmed that she had seen Shauna with this woman, but that she was a prostitute. She said she knew her as Veronica, that she worked Saturdays at another place, and that she often saw her with different men, but that this was the first time she had seen her at George's bar, and with a woman at that. We set up a stakeout in front of the other bar, and we were quickly able to catch this prostitute, who told us everything she knew when she realized she was going to be accused of murder. She told us that she had been hired by a rather scary guy to seduce Shauna so he could go to her apartment and steal her keys. And that's what she did. We asked her who had hired her, but she didn't know him. We showed her Doyle's picture, but it wasn't him. He was, according to her, much scarier. We then asked her why she had agreed to do this, and she replied that she had done it on the orders of her pimp, Mick Lindon. We asked her to draw a composite sketch of the man who had hired her, partly because it might be useful to us, and partly to keep our only lead on this murder in the police station. At the same time, Ryan contacted the pimp, telling him that his charge had been arrested for soliciting and he was coming to post her bail. Of course, Ryan and Esposito took him straight to the interrogation room to get him to reveal the guy's name. His name was Garrett Ward, and he had been the pimp's cellmate at the “5 Point” prison. We learned then that the aforementioned Garrett could have been a soldier, that he had a mission, that he was a big, bad, cracked guy, and that we shouldn't get in his way. By comparing the photo of Garrett recovered from the prison administration department with the composite sketch of the prostitute, we understood that he was our killer. All that remained was to find him, and to do that, we had to work on the motive. Why had Garrett tortured and killed Shauna? Castle reminded me that we had to call the central database to get Professor Wickfield's number because he was on the unlisted list and that he might be trying to find Wickfield. So, we quickly realized that the Professor could be in danger and we rushed to his house but we arrived too late. According to his wife, who was there at the time of the tragedy, Garrett tortured the professor to find out where “the child” was and then he broke his neck to kill him and he fled when he heard our sirens.
And here, I'm going to take a little dramatic pause because, while I'm telling this, I'm not eating or drinking anything, and I'm hungry and thirsty too!

Jake says:
Wow, Mom, you're a great storyteller! You're keeping us on the edge of our seats, and we're really looking forward to what happens next and finally seeing how Mr. Deschile fits into this story.
Reece adds:
And don't forget Mr. Doyle! Because just because he's off the radar for now doesn't mean this guy isn't important. Despite all his crazy antics, I'm sure he's the key to the investigation.
Rick looked at his son, gave him a big wink, and said :
Come on, let Mom eat a bit and wait for her to continue her story!
After a light snack, Kate continued : Ryan was interested in Garrett Ward's past and told us he hadn't found any paperwork on him before he went to prison, but we knew he'd been arrested for planting a bomb at an environmental rally organized by an environmental group led by a man named Jack Hastings, and we could find this person right away because he was currently giving a lecture in New York. Your father and I questioned him, and he told us it was Ward who had planted a bomb at their rally. He described him as a completely crazy person, propheciing wars and genocides to come as if he'd actually lived them, and once he was arrested, we wanted nothing more to do with him."" We also showed him Doyle's photo, and he told us he'd never seen him. We then asked him if he knew where Ward might have taken refuge, and he told us that Ward had once said he liked the East River Power Plant because its magnetic field protected him from government agents. Your father and I went there immediately and stumbled upon his hideout. Unfortunately, he was there, and he started trying to strangle me. I remember the force of his hands tightening around my neck, and I fainted. Rick immediately jumped on him, and Ward switched lenses and began strangling your father. I was just beginning to regain my breath and senses when Doyle appeared, activated his camera, and Ward ran away. I instinctively pointed my gun at Doyle, made your father give his camera, and handcuffed him to a pipe at the power plant. Then I called for backup to catch Ward. Alas, he had escaped, again.
In a file spread out on the table in Ward's den, there was a stained letter, obviously coffee-stained, of which we only had the front: we knew that this letter was addressed to Professor Wickfield, that it was dated April 7, 2001, but we didn't know the name of the author. There was also in the file a photo of a young man we didn't know. Doyle, although handcuffed, told us again that we were on the same side and that it would be wise to look for the original letter.
I had Ryan and Esposito sent to Professor Wickfield's office, and his wife found the letter. It had been sent by a young college student named Paul Deschile. Ryan realized then that Ward wasn't looking for a child, but for Deschile.
Once we got back to the station, I handcuffed Doyle to my desk to make sure I had an eye on him before he was re-evaluated psychologically. We tried to contact Paul, through his family and then a friend, and we learned from this friend that he was at the planetarium and that he had already given this information to someone who had called him earlier. We were very far from the planetarium to the station, but luckily, Ryan and Esposito were just around the corner, having just left Wickfield's office. Ward was on the verge of murdering Paul, but our top lieutenants were able to neutralize him. I interrogated him, but he didn't open his mouth, and he was transferred to the warehouse.
As for Simon Doyle, he retook his assessment and was released. He admitted to us that he had lied professionally on his test, but that it no longer mattered because we had saved Deschile, and that only that mattered because we had saved the world. I was seriously starting to lose it when Paul told us that he had been at the Hastings meeting, that it was there that he had met Professor Wickfield, that he was his role model at the time, and that it was he who had found the bomb at the meeting before it exploded and had thus ensured that Ward had failed. This logically explained why Ward had a grudge against Paul. I finished this crazy story in a nice hot bath and spent the rest of the day in my bathrobe in my apartment. I called your father, specifically asking him during our conversation not to mention the word “future”!
(Jake): This story is incredible, Mom, but honestly, you and Dad really put your lives in danger when you were in the East River Power Plant.
(Kate): Dad and I, as you say, were never very sensible when it came to taking risks, but we could always count on each other and we saved each other's lives many times. But I can assure you, as soon as we decided to bring you into the world, we really put the brakes on the adrenaline because neither of us wanted to make you orphans. But sometimes, I have to say, I missed it. Luckily, your father always knew how to find ways to never be bored. Always.
Kate couldn't help but give Rick a knowing look as she said this last word, who gave her a little wink and an equally knowing smile.
Paul spoke and said:
I'm so glad I heard this story! Now I know what a police investigation is like: incredibly complicated, dangerous, and above all, I now know perfectly well why and thanks to whom I'm still alive. Ms. Castle, you had a great team of investigators back then, not to mention your husband. Searching without understanding is sometimes our lot in Physics, but I've never voluntarily put myself in danger like you did for me. Thank you, thank you, thank you! But I must say goodbye because it's already late, and I have to be available very early tomorrow morning for a video meeting with my colleagues. But I've naturally reserved seats for you at my conference, and you are all my guests. I believe, Lily, Jake, and Reece, that you will have all the answers to the questions you have about my work and my commitments. Kate and Rick, thank you so much for this evening. As a single person, I really felt like I was with family. If you ever see those lieutenants who stopped Ward from assassinating me again, assure them of my gratitude, and if they're available tomorrow, they're also my guests. Now, Rick, could you call me a cab, please?
(Rick) : I'll do it right away and bring you your coat.
(Paul) : Thank you.
Kate stood up and addressed Paul:
Thank you for this little trip down memory lane! We were very pleased to have you here, and we'll be sure to attend your conference tomorrow. I promise I'll call Ryan and Esposito to see if they can make it.
(Paul) : Thanks again, and see you tomorrow!
The taxi arrived, and Paul said goodbye to his hosts.

Only Rick, Kate, and their children were able to attend the conference. Even Alexis declined the invitation because she had plans with her own family.
Paul Deschile entered the stage, sat down at the lectern, gathered his papers, and began reading:
“ Everyone in life seeks to improve their own personal comforts. Having a roof over their head, having enough to eat, having a car, a refrigerator, a vacuum cleaner, a dishwasher, and there's nothing fundamentally unhealthy about that. However, all of this requires energy. And energy requires fuel, which means raw materials. Unfortunately, the raw materials we use most often are not equitably distributed among countries, and this inevitably leads to geopolitical conflicts, which half the time lead to totalitarianism and war. This is why research, particularly into ways of using renewable energy sources such as the sun or wind, is ultimately a political search for solutions to armed conflicts, and therefore one of the essential paths to world peace.”
Throughout this introduction, Kate noticed tears rolling down Rick's cheeks, and she wondered why her husband was so sensitive. She took his hand, and Rick was leaning forward to explain when Paul Deschile continued:
“ Ladies and gentlemen, this introduction could have been my own, but you actually owe it to the great novelist Richard Castle, because this is how his book “Human Heat” begins. Richard Castle and his wife, Senator Katherine Beckett-Castle, a great advocate for environmental causes, are in this room today, and they know how much I owe them. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to give Mr. and Mrs. Castle a round of applause.”
Kate and Rick rose to thunderous applause, watched by their children, both amazed and proud.
Then the conference continued for a short hour, enriching for everyone, and the Castle family rose as one at the end to a boisterous standing ovation.
As they left the amphitheater, a staff member brought Castle a note that read: ""Meet me backstage, I have a surprise for you."" Signed Paul Deschile.
It was Sunday, the children had to be driven back to their boarding schools, and it was already quite late. Rick showed Kate Deschile's note and asked if she could handle the children's transportation to their respective boarding schools on her own. She replied with stars in her eyes:
Baby, I can't see myself depriving you of this moment. Go ahead, join him. You can tell me about it tonight in our bed before we sleep.
Kate and the children left, and Rick went backstage to Paul Deschile's dressing room. He knocked on the door. Paul ushered him in and said :
Mr. Castle, I'd like you to sit down because the surprise I have in store for you might really come as a shock.
Castle complied with a worried look. There was another knock, Paul opened it, and greeted... Simon Doyle! Rick noticed right away that he hadn't changed since they first met! Not a wrinkle. His hair and beard were the same. He looked... like he hadn't aged! Rick pinched himself to make sure he wasn't dreaming and stammered :
So it was true, you really did come from the future!
Paul took Castle by the arm and said :
Some of our discoveries and some of our eminent scholars like Simon still need to be protected from widespread dissemination. But yes, Simon was indeed sent back in time to ultimately save me. Few people know about this, and it must remain that way. That's why, in light of your new book, I ask you to be very careful when interviewed and to always emphasize that your writings remain fiction. It's a matter of national security.
Rick said he understood and turned to Simon:
I'm so happy to see you again and to be able to clear up my doubts. I'll be careful, I promise. If you don't mind, I have two favors to ask: the first: I did marry Kate, I did have three children (by the way, their names are Lily, Jake, and Reece, but I know now that you knew that when we met), I did write novels that some have considered ""great literature,"" but I didn't see the murderous wars of 2031. Can you explain?
Simon looked at Paul, who gave him a sign that meant: you can talk to him. Simon then explained that some wars in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia had been ignored by the media, and that the energy shield had operated primarily in airspace, or even in space altogether, which, of course, had not been revealed to the general public for obvious reasons. He added:
Mr. Castle, you are now sworn to secrecy, but you deserved to know, and we trust you completely.
Rick choked back a sob and said :
Thank you, thank you, thank you! You are now one of my friends, and you will never have to fear me. Will you allow me to tell my wife? After all, she's the one who saved you, Mr. Deschile. I assure you, she'll say nothing.
Paul and Simon looked at each other and said together : Okay.
And Simon thought it wise to add :
But don't tell your children. They're still too young, and they need stability at their age.
Rick understood and promised not to reveal anything to the children.
Simon then said:
And the second favor?
Castle said:
You know, you left your time tracker at the police station when you disappeared for good... Does it still work, and can I keep it as a souvenir?
Simon smiled and said:
You can keep it; it's obsolete now and can't work anymore. But it's decorative and a testament to our meeting!
Rick thanked them again and said goodbye to Paul and Simon, as it was really late this time, and he was eager to get back to Kate as soon as possible after such an intense emotional shock. At the door, he turned and simply said:
I hope we meet again.
And Simon replied:
The future will tell!
To which Rick replied, smiling:
Take care of yourselves... and of us!

Rick came home, his head still in the clouds, and Kate was waiting for him, lying on the living room couch. She had Rick's latest book in her hand and was rereading the words Paul had used for his lecture. Rick poured two glasses of wine and went to sit next to his wife, who had straightened up.
(Kate): You know, tonight I realized again that I married the most extraordinary man I've ever met in my entire life. This weekend was a success thanks to you, and I was so proud when Deschile read from your book. But you know what made me even more proud of you?
No, I don't know.
It's that at no point yesterday, during my account of the investigation, in front of the children, did you make a noise, clear your throat, or try to change anything. And I know that must have been difficult! I love you, Richard Castle. You're a good, loving, respectful man... and you still have sex appeal!
(Rick): Thanks, Kate. You still stand up for yourself pretty well, but if I'm good, loving, and respectful, like you say, it's because you deserve it. You're also the best thing I've ever met on this earth, and I can never thank your parents enough for bringing you into this world.
They kissed tenderly and Rick said :
You know, the surprise? Well, I'm really going to have a hard time explaining it to you, and above all, I don't want you to make fun of me.
(Kate) : To that extent? What happened?
(Rick) : Well, first of all, you have to promise me that what I'm about to tell you will remain strictly between us and that you will never break this oath with anyone, not even our children.
""Okay,"" Kate replied, intrigued.
(Rick) : When I arrived in Paul's dressing room, he told me to sit down so I wouldn't fall over when the surprise came, and it's a good thing he told me to do so, because thirty seconds later there was a knock at his door and Paul called in: ""Guess who?""
“Come on, Rick, the game was last night. So, who was it?”
“Simon Doyle!”
Rick then told Kate everything about their conversations, and then he looked her straight in the eyes and said, after a deep breath: 
Doyle really did come from the future!
Kate looked at her husband tenderly and said:
This time, I'm not going to make fun of you because I should have confessed something to you a long time ago, but I never could, I couldn't convince myself until today. If you join me in bed, I'll tell you.
Kate went to undress and got into bed first, followed closely by her husband.
(Kate) : Do you remember the stained letter of which we only had the first page in the file found at the East River power plant?
(Rick) : Yes, with the photo of Deschile.
(Kate) : And do you remember that Doyle suggested we find the original to get his name? 
(Rick) : Yes, and he even said a lot of other things, including that I would marry you, that we would have three children, that you would be a senator, and that I would write great literature. Do you realize?
Kate gave Castle her killer look, and Rick said : 
Sorry, I interrupted. So, the letter?
(Kate) : Esposito and Ryan went to get it from Wickfield's office, and the letter was immaculate. By that I mean, without a single stain.
(Rick) : Okay, so what?
(Kate) : Well, when you came home after losing sight of Doyle just as you were trying to return his time tracker, I stayed in the office for a bit to tidy up the file and accidentally spilled my coffee on the letter. I rushed over to put more papers on top to mop it up, and when I retrieved the mostly dry letter, it had the exact same coffee stain as the first page I found at the power plant. I couldn't fight it anymore. The only logical explanation was the one you believed in and the one I'd been fighting all along. 
(Rick) : Kate, I don't know what to say anymore...
(Kate) : So don't say anything, baby, let's forget all this for now and kiss me.
Rick kissed his wife tenderly, and they both said at the same time, as in the heyday of their joint investigations: ""Not a word to the kids!""
They smiled at their complicity as they fell asleep peacefully in each other's arms.

I believe this. I don’t believe she jumped, or even leaned over to vomit. I don’t believe the family is nefarious. Her brother was 21 at the time, and was a different person than he may be now. They were close siblings and I can see that in the pictures, podcasts, etc. I think they were just a regular family from Virginia. Even family friends saw how close they all were. I don’t believe she committed suicide so moving on. 

With that said, I’m thinking she’s out on the balcony laying down after her brother went to bed. Assuming she’s having trouble sleeping, so instead of laying there, maybe she decided to go outside for a little and walk around the ship. Whether to go get water after a night of drinking, find another spot to pass out at on the top of the ship, get coffee, etc. I can see myself personally doing any of those things.

She left the balcony door, thinking maybe she’ll be back quickly and didn’t matter if it was slightly opened (grabbing water or coffee theory). She probably didn’t close the slider all the way, to not wake her parents up (those make a lot of noise). Her probably grabbed flip flops she had near the door or went barefoot - both not weird to do. 

And then something nefarious happened in that time. Whether Yellow saw her and convinced her to go somewhere with him, maybe said there’s an empty room somewhere, someone grabbed her, etc. That might explain the two girls seeing her. ",1,1753447161.0,AmyLynnBradley,0,0.6,False

The math's not mathing, making me worry about my friend's mental health.

I've (F36) known my friend ""Lynn"" (48) for almost 5 years now. We met through a local meetup when lockdowns started to subside. She’s my concert and coffee buddy, we share a love for the same types of music and a coffee. 

Lynn has apparently been with her boyfriend ""Leon"" (M50?) for nearly 15 years. He is the love of her life and has taken such good care of Lynn over the years. He cooks, he cleans, he cares about her feelings, he's good in bed.

But I've never actually met Leon. Never seen him, or spoke to him. Nobody we mutually know has. According to Lynn, he wants to meet me and have dinner sometime. But dinner plans have never actually happened, even when I've tried to set a time and place. All I've seen are some photos of a guy who she says is Leon.

I've also never been inside Lynn's apartment. I've picked her up in the parking lot, but have never been invited inside. Generally, she has either come over to my place or we meet up in public.

She insists their apartment is too messy and also, Leon is terminally ill. He's a recluse who works part-time from home and was supposed to pass away about 7-8 years ago. But he hasn't yet. Therefore, he's afraid of venturing out of the house or meeting people, catching a cold, and dying. So he's just hanging on for as long as he can in their messy apartment.

Now that nearly 5 years have gone by, I can't help but think something smells bad about this situation. My current hypotheses are:
1. Lynn dearly loves Leon is and trying to hold onto him for as long as possible.
2. Leon is very mentally ill. Lynn is covering for him for some reason instead getting him therapy. Or Leon is stringing her along with how sick he is and living off of her. 
3. Leon doesn't exist. Lynn is very mentally ill and has done a relatively good job hiding it for 5 years.

So how do I handle this? I feel like I'm being lied to about something, but also worried for my friend's well-being. I find myself avoiding her because I feel so conflicted.",1,1753446976.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

The Rules Are Changing.”,"Read: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lwk0ql/night_shift_at_the_evergrove_market_day_1/)

Believe it or not, I’ve made it three whole weeks in this nightmare.

Three weeks of bone-deep whispers, flickering lights, and pale things pretending to be people.

And somehow, against all odds, I keep making it to sunrise.

By now, I’ve realized something very comforting—sarcasm fully intended:

The horror here runs on a schedule.

The Pale Lady shows up every night at exactly 1:15 a.m.

Not a minute early. Not a second late.

She always asks for meat—the same meat she already knows is in the freezer behind the store.

I never see her leave. She just stands there, grinning like a damn wax statue for two straight minutes… then floats off to get it herself.

Every third night, the lights go out at 12:43 a.m.

Right on the dot.

Just long enough for me to crawl behind a shelf, hold my breath, and wonder what thing is breathing just a few feet away in the dark.

And every two days, the ancient intercom crackles to life and croaks the same cheerful death sentence:

“Attention Evergrove Staff. Remi in aisle 8, please report to the reception.”

It’s always when I’m in aisle 8.

It’s always my name.

The only thing that changes is the freak show of “customers” after 2 a.m.

They’re different from the hostile monster I met on my first shift—more… polite. Fake.

On Wednesdays, it’s an old woman with way too many teeth and no concept of personal space.

Thursdays, a smooth-talking businessman in a sharp suit follows me around, asking for the latest cigarettes.

I never respond.

Rule 4 …. is pretty clear:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

And the old man—my “boss”—well, he’s always surprised to see me at the end of each shift.

Not happy. Not relieved.

Just... surprised. Like he’s been quietly rooting for the building to eat me.

This morning? Same deal. He walked in at 6:00 a.m. sharp, his coat still covered in frost that somehow never melts.

“Here’s your paycheck,” he said, sliding the envelope across the breakroom table.

$500 for another night of surviving hell. 

But this time, something was different in his face.

Less dead-eyed exhaustion, more… pity. Or maybe fear.

“So, promotion’s the golden ticket out, huh?” I said, dry as dust, like the idea didn’t make my skin crawl. Not that I’d ever take it.

That note from my first night still burned in the back of my skull like a warning:

DON’T ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

He didn’t answer right away. Just looked at me like I’d said something dangerous.

Finally, he muttered, “You better hope you don’t survive long enough to be offered one.”

Yeah. That shut me up.

He sat across from me, his eyes flicking toward the clock like something was counting down.

“This place,” he said, voice low like he was afraid it might hear him, “after midnight… it stops being a store.”

His gaze didn’t meet mine. It drifted toward the flickering ceiling light, like he was remembering something he wished he could forget.

“It looks the same. Aisles. Shelves. Registers. But underneath, it’s different. It turns into something else. A threshold. A mouth. A… trap.”

He paused, hands tightening around his mug until the ceramic creaked.

“There’s something on the other side. Watching. Waiting. And every so often… it reaches through.”

He took a breath like he’d just surfaced from deep water.

“That’s when people get ‘promoted.’”

He said the word like it tasted rotten.

I frowned. “Promoted by who?”

He looked at me then. Just for a second.

Not with fear. With resignation.

Like he’d already accepted, his answer was too late to help me.

“He wears a suit. Always a suit. Too perfect. Too still. Like he was made in a place where nothing alive should come from.”

The old man’s voice went brittle.

“You’ll know him when you see him. Something about him... it doesn’t belong in this world. Doesn’t pretend to, either. Like a mannequin that learned how to walk and smile, but not why.”

Another pause.

“Eyes like mirrors. Smile like a trap. And a voice you’ll still hear three days after he’s gone.”

His fingers trembled now, just a little.

“This place calls him the Night Manager.”

I didn’t say anything at first.

Just sat there, staring at the old man while the weight of his words sank in like cold water through a thin coat.

The Night Manager.

The name itself felt wrong. Too simple for something that didn’t sound remotely human.

I swallowed hard, suddenly aware of every flickering shadow in the corners of the breakroom.

The hum of the vending machine behind me sounded like it was breathing.

Finally, I managed to speak, voice quieter than I expected.

“…How long have you been working here?”

He stared into his coffee for a long moment. When he finally spoke, his voice was smaller.

“I was fifteen. Came here looking for my dad.”

Another pause. Longer this time. He looked like the words hurt.

“There was a girl working with me. Younger than you. Two months in, she got offered a promotion. Took it. Gone the next day. No trace. No mention. Just... erased.”

He kept going, softer now.

“Found out later my dad got the same offer. Worked four nights. Just four. Then vanished. No goodbye. No clue. Just... gone.”

Then he looked at me. And I swear, for the first time, he looked human—not like the tired crypt keeper who hands me my checks.

“That’s when I stopped looking for him,” he said. “His fate was the same as everyone else who took the promotion. Just… gone.”

And then the clock hit 6:10, and just like that, he waved me off. Like he hadn’t just dumped a lifetime of this store’s lore straight into my lap.

I went home feeling... something. Dread? Grief? Maybe both.

But here’s the thing—I still sleep like a rock. Every single night.

It’s a skill I picked up after years of dozing off to yelling matches through the walls.

I guess that’s the only upside to having nothing left to care about—silence sticks easier when there’s no one left to miss you.

There wasn’t anything left to do anyways. I’d already exhausted every half-rational plan to claw my way out of this waking nightmare.

After my first shift, I went full tinfoil-hat mode—hours lost in internet rabbit holes, digging through dead forums, broken archives, and sketchy conspiracy blogs.

Evergrove Market. The town. The things that whisper after midnight.

Nothing.

Just ancient Reddit threads with zero replies, broken links, and a wall of digital silence.

Not even my overpriced, utterly useless engineering degree could make sense of it.

By the third night, I gave up on Google and stumbled into the town library as soon as it opened at 7 a.m. I looked like hell—raccoon eyes, hoodie, stale energy drink breath. A walking red flag.

The librarian clocked me instantly. One glance, and I knew she’d mentally added me to the “trouble” list.

Still, I gave it a shot.

I asked her if they had anything on cursed buildings, haunted retail spaces, or entities shaped like oversized dogs with jaws that hinged the wrong way.

She gave me the kind of look reserved for people who mutter to themselves on public transit. One perfectly raised brow and a twitch of the hand near the desk phone, like she was debating whether to dial psych services or security.

Honestly? I wouldn’t have blamed her.

But she didn’t. And I walked out with nothing but more questions.

This morning, I slept like a corpse again.

Three weeks of surviving hell shifts had earned me one thing: the ability to pass out like the dead and wake up to return to torture I now call work.

But the moment I walked through the door, something was wrong.

Not just off—wrong. It felt like standing at the edge of a cliff, gravity whispering your name. Everything in me screamed: run.

But the contract? The contract said don’t.

And I’m more scared of breaking that than dying.

So I stepped inside.

The reception was empty.

No old man. No sarcastic remarks. No frost-covered coat.

I checked the usual places—the haunted freezer, aisle 8, even the breakroom.

Nothing. No one.

My shift started quietly. Too quietly.

It was Thursday, so I waited for the schedule to kick in.

Pale Lady at 1:15. The businessman around 3. Then the whispers. The lights. The routine nightmare.

But tonight, the system failed.

At 1:30, the freezer started humming.

In reverse.

Not a metaphor. Literally backwards. Like someone had rewound reality by mistake. The air around aisle five warped with the sound, like it was bending under the weight of something it couldn’t see.

Even the Pale Lady didn’t show up tonight. And that freak never misses her meat run.

No flickering lights. No intercom.

Just silence.

Then, at 3:00 a.m., the businessman arrived.

Same tailored suit. Same perfect hair. But no words. No stalking.

He walked up to the front doors, pulled a laminated sheet from inside his jacket, and slapped it against the glass.

Then he left.

No nod. No look. No goodbye.

Just gone.

I walked up to the door, heart already thudding. I didn’t even need to read it.

Same font. Same laminate.

Same cursed format that had already ruined any hope of a normal life.

Another list.

**NEW STAFF DIRECTIVE – PHASE TWO**

*Effective Immediately*

I started reading.

1. **The reflections in the cooler doors are no longer yours after 2:17 a.m. Do not look at them. If you accidentally do, keep eye contact. It gets worse if you look away first.**

Cool. Starting strong.

1. **If you hear a baby crying in Aisle 3, proceed to the loading dock and lock yourself inside. Stay there for exactly 11 minutes. No more. No less.**

Because babies are terrifying now, apparently.

1. **A second you may arrive at any time. Do not speak to them. Do not let them speak to you. If they say your name, cover your ears and run to the cleaning supply closet. Lock the door. Count to 200. Wait for silence.**

What the actual hell?

1. **If you find yourself outside the store without remembering how you got there—go back inside immediately. Do not look at the sky.**

1. **Something new lives behind the canned goods aisle. If you hear it breathing, whistle softly as you walk by. It hates silence.**

1. **If the intercom crackles at 4:44 a.m., stop whatever you're doing and lie face down on the floor. Do not move. You will hear your name spoken backward. Do not react.**

1. **Do not use the bathroom between 1:33 a.m. and 2:06 a.m. Someone else is in there. They do not know they are dead.**

1. **If the fluorescent lights begin to pulse in sets of three, you are being watched. Do not acknowledge it. Speak in a language you don’t know until it passes.**

1. **There will be a man in a suit standing just outside the front doors at some point. His smile will be too wide. He does not blink. Do not let him in. Do not wave. Do not turn your back.**

1. **If the emergency alarm sounds and you hear someone scream your mother’s name—run. Do not stop. Do not check the time. Run until your legs give out or the sun rises. Whichever comes first.**

I blinked.

Once.

Twice.

What the actual hell?

April Fools? Except it’s July. And no one here has a sense of humor—least of all me.

I stared at one of the lines, as if rereading it would somehow make it make sense:

""A second you may arrive tonight. Do not speak to them…""

Yeah. Totally normal. Just me and my evil doppelgänger hanging out in aisle three.

""Do not look at the sky.""

""Speak in a language you don’t know.""

""Run until your legs give out or the sun rises.""

By the time I reached the last line, I wasn’t even scared. Not really.

I was numb.

Like someone had handed me the diary of a lunatic and said, “Live by this or die screaming.”

It was unhinged. Unfollowable. Inhuman.

And yet?

I didn’t laugh.

Because I’ve seen things.

Things that defy explanation. Things that should not exist.

The freezer humming like it’s rewinding reality.

Shadows that slither against physics. 

The businessman with the dead eyes and the too-quiet shoes who shows up only to tack new horrors to the wall like corporate memos from hell.

This place stopped pretending to make sense the moment I locked that thing in the basement on my first shift.

And that’s why this list scared the hell out of me.

Because rules—real rules—can be followed. Survived.

But this? This was a warning stapled to the jaws of something that plans to bite.

I folded the page with shaking hands, slipped it into my pocket like a sacred text, and backed away from the front door.

That’s when it happened.

That... shift.

Like gravity blinked. Like the air twitched.

The front door creaked—not the usual automatic hiss and chime, but a long, slow swing like a church door opening at a funeral.

I turned.

And he walked in.

Black shoes, polished like obsidian.

A charcoal suit that clung to him like a shadow.

Tall. Too tall to be usual but not tall enough to be impossible. And sharp—like someone had sculpted him out of glass and intent.

He looked like he belonged on a red carpet or a Wall Street throne.

But in the flickering, jaundiced lights of Evergrove Market, he didn’t look human.

Not wrong, exactly. Just... off.

Like a simulation rendered one resolution too high. Like someone had described “man” to an alien artist and this was the first draft.

His smile was perfect.

Too perfect.

Practiced, like a knife learning to grin.

The temperature dropped the moment he stepped over the threshold.

He didn’t say a word. Just stared at me.

Eyes like static—glass marbles that shimmered with a color I didn’t have a name for. A color that probably doesn’t belong in this dimension.

And I knew.

Right then, I knew why the old man warned me. Why he flinched every time I brought up promotions.

Because this was the one who offers them.

From behind the counter, the old man appeared. Quiet. Like he’d been summoned by scent or blood or fate.

He didn’t look shocked.

Just... done. Like someone waiting for the train they swore they’d never board. He gave the tiniest nod. “This,” he said, voice barely above a whisper, “is the Night Manager.”

I stared.

The thing called the night manager stared back.

No blinking.

No breathing.

Just that flawless, eerie smile.

And then, in a voice that slid under my skin and curled against my spine, he said:

We actually met in DC and both went to college here so the transition was pretty painless and smooth.  It’s nice to see family and old friends as we’re both from the east coast originally. 

But man, do we miss Sac. We both cried as we headed east on 80 out of the city. We miss the coffee, the people, the food, the palm trees and sunshine.  We miss the plants and the hummingbirds and the delta breeze. We miss the laid back vibe of the river on a weekday in the summer. God I miss the Panaderias, the elote man, the vibrant colors and architecture. Cold mornings and oppressive sunshine. Clear blue skies. 

What a special hidden gem of a paradise. I don’t feel like I took it for granted when I lived there, but man do I miss the small things now that they’re gone. 

Take care sacramento, stay you, we’ll be back for sure, hopefully for good.  ❤️

1m8xnh6,https://i.redd.it/9p1fw6p4j0ff1.jpeg,Help dialing in Tabi beans,"Picked up a bag of these recently from Middle State Coffee in Denver. The barista seemed to highly recommend these beans over some of the others. I rested them for 2 weeks per his recommendations, but after 4 cups I’ve really only been able to produce what I consider to be “generic coffee flavor.” 

I’m using a v60 and Comandante C40. I started at 25 clicks (93 C) and Lance’s 1-2-1 method, but that produced a cup that was way too acidic. So I dialed the C40 down to 20 clicks and then brewed with 4 equal pours instead. But that just produced more of a bitter cup. I haven’t been able to pick up any fruit notes at all. I’m not one to try and taste everything tasting note put on the bag, but with tasting notes like these I would expect to at least get a slight fruity feel and taste.

I’ll continue to adjust grind size and temp, but since this is the first time I’ve brewed Tabi beans I figured I’d see if anyone on here has any advice or recipes for them.

Thanks!

I think I’ve been in a really long flare (if that’s even possible) for months. One of my biggest symptoms these days is I can no longer tolerate any sort of caffeine. I used to be able to slam a coffee or energy drink every morning and feel amazing even with a more elevated heart rate but fuck, now all I do is vibrate and then dissolve (faint) an hour after consuming a tiny amount of caffeine. As a coffee lover this is tough, I enjoy treating myself at least once a month but the consequences suck and last all day! Water and electrolytes help in the slightest but are there any snacks that go well with coffee that don’t make you feel as shitty? ",7,1753445867.0,POTS,19,0.9,False

1m8xk39,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1m8xk39/sf_spacecraft/,[SF] Spacecraft.,"In 1946, I inherited a large patch of land just outside of the wonderfully named town of Zzyzx, in California, including part of the Mojave Desert. There were about 500 acres, included was a large farmhouse, outbuildings and approx. 700 head of cattle, plus acres of Alfalfa. 

As a city dweller, I was totally out of my depth, luckily my late uncle had employed about 20 staff, so the farm ran very well under the farm manager that my uncle had employed. I had nothing to do, so using one of the farm's jeeps, I set off to explore my new domain. Each day I would take a map, compass, food, and a flask of coffee. 

It was on one of these exploratory trips, that I got lost, the compass went haywire, spinning wildly like a top. As I didn’t know the area, I was totally disoriented. Nothing looked familiar. I parked up and looked around, all the sand dunes looked the same. 

My brain felt foggy, I couldn’t concentrate. I slumped back in my seat, I couldn’t focus on the map, I’d forgotten everything that Sargent Olsen had taught me when I was drafted into the army in “42. 

How long I sat there, I don’t know, when I became aware of my surroundings, it was still daylight, but the sun was in the wrong position in the sky. I drove back to the farmhouse, it was 5:00 am, somehow, I had lost at least 14 hours. 

I was ravenous, I went for a shower, wrinkling my nose up at the smell of stale urine that surrounded me. Had I been out of it for so long I had wet myself.? After putting my clothes in the laundry basket, I took a long hot shower. 

After showering, I cooked a large breakfast of bacon, eggs, hash browns, toast, coffee, and O.J. that would set me up for the day. After eating, I made my way to the tool store, collecting a sledgehammer and a load of wooden marker stakes. 

I dipped the tops of the stakes in red paint so they would be visible. I made two flasks of coffee, some sandwiches, I took a new smaller scale map showing the area where I had been yesterday, plus plenty of pencils, so I could mark the area. 

It took me a few weeks to plot out the area, but I ended up with a circular area, about 60 feet across, I noticed that the plant growth was different inside the circle. I spoke with the farm manager and asked him about the area, he said that the local Indian’s wouldn’t go near there, they thought the area was haunted by bad spirits. 

He said that even the cattle avoided the area and wouldn’t graze there. I told him that I was going to investigate the area, I hired a digger and started excavating. I had excavated down about ten feet, when I hit something hard, try as I might, I couldn’t dig it up, I moved about six feet to the side and tried again with the same result. 

I spent the day excavating, moving around, and excavating some more. Within a week the smooth desert sand resembled the craters on the moon or the battlefield of the Somme. I had no idea what I was digging up, but I was like a man obsessed, I would drive out there early every day, and would labour under the blazing sun, until late at night. 

Finally, I uncovered a large metal plate, recessed into the metal was a large locking wheel, as I touched it, I was hit by a loud burst of static, just like a wireless radio, that needed tuning in properly. The noise was so loud, my ears started to bleed, I sat there, dazed, my head feeling like it was going to split in two. 

As suddenly as it had started, the noise was gone. I wiped my face and drank my coffee while my heart returned to a regular beat, and then I walked back to the metal panel, very gingerly, I reached out and touched the locking wheel. I was tensed up expecting another burst of static, but there was nothing. 

The panel was covered in strange markings, unlike anything I had seen before. I lay on my back in the sun, thinking hard, what on earth had I found, I suddenly thought, maybe what I had found wasn’t from earth at all. I decided to try something, I picked up the sledgehammer and swung it hard against the panel.

There was a dull clunk, and the vibration of the hammerhead shook the hammer from my stinging hands. The panel was undamaged, not the tiniest scratch was visible. This confirmed to my mind that I was standing on a piece of alien technology, my mind was agog, how far had this thing travelled.? 



I climbed back into the digger and moved back a few feet, I started digging, I continued down until I could see the bottom of this thing, it didn’t seem very big, maybe ten-feet deep, and approx. sixty feet across. There appeared to be a gentle curve to the thing, making it oval and not flat. 

It appeared to be embedded in the rock of the hillside. I gave some serious thought about opening it.? When I drove home late that night, I was thinking of the gas masks, we had used in the Pacific while fighting the Japanese, would the masks be sufficient.? Probably not, what else could I use?. 

Then in the morning, it came to me, back in my hometown, an old army buddy had set up a sub-aqua diving club, he had racks of diving suits, and more importantly self-contained breathing kits. I made a few long-distance phone calls and undertook the long drive back to Long Beach, after calling in to see Mom and Pop, I called in to see Jimmy Brent. 

We had grown up together, went to the same schools, played little league together, kissed the same girls, got called up together and served in the same pioneer unit in the Pacific. That is where I learned to use heavy earth moving equipment, and because I still had my operator’s license, I could hire the digger. 

After the war, Jimmy had opened a diving school, that was slowly taking off, he had about 200 members, and a fully equipped hire shop, including a large oxygen compressor for refilling oxygen bottles. We met for a few drinks, a few turned into a lot, and we both got rat-arsed, getting kicked out of a bar at about 2:00 am. 



Both of us were way too drunk to drive. We staggered the few blocks back to Jimmy’s shop, and crashed out on a pile of wetsuits, we had both slept in worse places. In the morning, over coffee, I gently probed Jimmy about wetsuits and breathing equipment. I fed him some cock and bull story about finding a cave system on my land and wanting to explore it, but there was a large underground river blocking the way. 

Jimmy started talking about the merits of different wetsuits for their thermal properties, and different sized oxygen bottles and face masks. I left there with a top of the range wetsuit and three 40-minute oxygen bottles. Plus, contact details of a local (to me) diving club. 

After a few days, I loaded up my car that my uncle had left me in his will, a sandy coloured 1946 Studebaker and started the 190-mile trip home to Zzyzx. After a few days, talking with the farm manager and checking that the farm was running properly, I decided it was time to crack open the craft. 

So early next morning, I drove the old farm jeep up to where the craft was still semi-buried. I pulled on the bulky wetsuit and connecting the oxygen bottle just had Jimmy had shown me, I approached the craft. I made sure that the goggles were tight on my face, turned on the oxygen bottles, put the mouthpiece between my teeth, and taking a deep breath, reached up and turned the locking wheel. 

With a sharp screech, the wheel started to turn, after two full turns, the door swung open, I could feel countless centuries of dead foul air rushing past me. After about fifteen minutes, the air pressure seemed to equalize. I opened my eyes, I hadn’t realized that I had shut them, I looked for the first time inside a vehicle that hadn’t been made on earth.

As I looked, small purplish coloured lights came on, they didn’t show much. I decided to return in the morning, with flashlights so I could explore the craft safely. The next morning, I returned after a hearty breakfast, I wriggled into the craft. The craft seemed to be sitting pretty level as if it had been parked and not crashed. 

The head height seemed to be about 6 feet, I’m 5 feet 10 inches tall, so, I could stand up straight. I walked slowly down the corridor, there were hatches leading off from both sides, I could see piles of greenish/blue dust laying in corners, I noticed that as I walked deeper inside the craft, lights started to come on, these were a lot brighter. 

The corridor led to a large room, all the walls were of a white metal, in front of a large featureless wall, was a chair, it looked a little small for me, but I managed to sit down. As I rested my hands on the arms of the chair, buttons suddenly lit up, the wall in front of me slide to the side, exposing a large picture of the surrounding area. 

As I sat there, headphones clamped themselves into my ears, there was a burst of static, and I could feel the engines burst into life. Without a sound, the craft was starting to extract itself from where it had been buried for millions of years. As the craft gained height, the picture in front of me changed to a seamless view of the surrounding area, I could see my farm. 

I could feel myself getting weaker, the craft was using my lifeforce to power itself. As I blacked out, there were alarms blaring. The craft had only been flying for about a minute before it crashed. 



Official Report.



We responded to reports of a plane crash, we found the area littered with pieces of a substance, unlike anything we had ever seen before. Very light, like tissue paper, but incredibly strong. Recommend the whole area is put into quarantine and cordoned off. ASAP.

The End.

1m8xjdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/1m8xjdy/my_psoriasis_and_diet/,My psoriasis and diet,"About a year ago I started getting very itchy scalp and extremely dry hands. Initially moisturizing helped, but suddenly it seemed like I was putting lotion on my hands all the time, I would wake up in the middle of the night scratching them anyway. I finally went to a doctor when my palms starting splitting. 

  
When I went in the splits were healing up, but I had foresight to take some photos. Quickly and easily diagnosed as palmoplantar psoriasis and clobetasol (sp?) was prescribed. Problem solved, sort of. Strong steroids would stop or reduce my psoriasis but never quite eliminated it from coming back, it was more like 2 weeks on 2 weeks off, although my scalp issues went away and stayed away. 

Like most here I noticed that when I would vacation or travel I would clear up and have fewer problems. So I do think stress is a strong trigger for me. Then I also realized that the foods I was eating when I would travel were very different than what I typically ate at home. I tried a few versions of restrictive diets I have narrowed mine down to dairy/lactose products. By cutting out everything except milk in my coffee my psoriasis is all but gone I haven't had to use steroid ointment in about 6 weeks. 

  
So while everyone's body is different and responds differently to what you put in it/on it, I think you should keep trying and exploring what will work best for you. Having this and dealing with this absolutely sucks, but through some persistence and luck I was able to hopefully figure out mine.

  
Diets I tried:

Gluten free (no effect)  
sugar free (no effecy)  
Lactose free (effect!)  
Nut free (no effect)

Therapies:  
short band UV (mild)  
sun (strong)

Medications:  
Euchrasia (no effect)  
Cortizone (no effect)  
Ammonium lactate (helped skin under psoriasis)  
Salycyclic acid (mild)  
Clobetasol (ointment/alcohol, very effective)

UV lights and sun helped but it was nearly impossible to maintain the amount of exposure I needed and work as needed. Clobetasol 2 weeks on 2 weeks off would clear me up, and then I would start a diet a one week through my clobetasol treatment. Eventually learning that lactose free has worked wonders for me. I was told by a doctor that some people my age do become lactose intolerant (40s).

  
I hope this does help someone else, as mentioned it drove me crazy but it seems like a have a plan I can try to follow. As a sidenote I did try some ice cream and it didn't lead to full blown episode, but I could feel a gradual itchy feeling returning in my palms and at my next physical I do plan to ask about some type of testing to confirm what I have stumbled upon.
