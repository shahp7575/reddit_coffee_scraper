That’s the word everyone used. Lovely.

Wide sidewalks. Slow traffic. Friendly hellos from people you didn’t really know. The kind of place where nothing ever happened, and that was the point.

Sarah noticed the birds first.

Or rather, how often she noticed them.
Every morning at 6:42, a medley of soft, cheerful chirps began drifting from the trees. Not always the same birds, but the same tone—melodic, measured, comforting.

It was everywhere. At the park, along the bike trail, even in the little café with the minimalist chairs and seven-dollar lattes.

Theo, her husband, was the first to say it out loud.
“You ever think those birds sound… fake?”

Sarah blinked. “What do you mean?”

“I don’t know. It’s like… they’re always on. Same rhythm.”

She laughed. “You’re analyzing birds now?”

But the thought clung to her.

Especially after she noticed the coincidences.

The birdsong got a little louder the day protests were mentioned on the news.
It seemed to swell in volume when someone at the office voiced a slightly different opinion.
And every time there was a tense conversation—about rent, or the war, or elections—the birds would sing.

Not louder, exactly. Just… clearer. Like static being tuned away.

Eventually, you stopped finishing your sentence. You softened your words. You agreed.

Not because you were forced to.
Just because it felt better that way.

Theo started wearing earbuds around the house. “White noise,” he said.
Sarah thought he was being dramatic.

Then he unplugged the speaker in the guest room—the one that played bird sounds automatically at night. Just once.

The next morning, the speaker was back on.
No one had touched it.

They didn’t fight. That wasn’t how things happened here.
They just… stopped discussing things that weren’t pleasant.

Theo still made breakfast. Sarah still smiled at the neighbors.
And the birds still sang.

They weren’t real. She knew that now.
They were part of a sound design package for public spaces. Something about “emotional stability” and “community wellness.” She looked it up once. The website was gone.

Still, it helped. No one got angry anymore.
The air was light. Easy. Agreeable.

Even Theo softened. He stopped wearing the earbuds. He smiled more.
One morning, she heard him humming the bird song. The notes were perfect.

She kissed his cheek and brewed the coffee.
It was just another lovely morning.
The sun glinted off the flags in front yards.
The air smelled like grass, and lemon, and clean memory.

And when she heard the birds begin—soft, measured, always in tune—

I stopped at 2 stores on my way back to pick up 4-5 items that added another hour. Had lunch, prepped dinner, then went to lie down. Slept 3 hrs. PEM fatigue--full out crash. 

Every time I feel fatigued, I don't just rest, I fall asleep a full 3 hrs and even after that find it hard to get up. 

Are these 3-4 hr naps and finding it hard to rise in the morning more moderate than mild?

Unlike its more famous neighbor, Corfu, it maintains a low-key charm and attracts only a handful of visitors throughout the year. With no airport to speak of, Paxos remains blissfully serene, making it a perfect getaway for those looking to escape the crowds. One of the island’s most intriguing historical sites is **Agios Nikolaos Castle**, a fortress built to protect the island from pirates in the 15th century. If you're planning a visit to Paxos, make sure this stunning castle is on your itinerary!

*Processing img pj1p632oyjte1...*

[The Fascinating History of Agios Nikolaos Castle](https://www.paxosglyfada.com/agios-nikolaos-castle/)

The story of Agios Nikolaos Castle goes back to the Venetian era, when the island of Paxos was under Venetian rule from 1381. The castle was originally known as the Venetian Castle of Paxos and was built in the early 15th century after the island came under threat from frequent pirate attacks. Local Venetian lord **Adam Il San Ippolito** petitioned the Venetian Senate to fund the construction of a fortress to protect Paxos. The chosen location was a small islet in Gaios Harbor—what we now call **Agios Nikolaos Island**. From this vantage point, the castle could oversee the entire island and its coastline, providing a strategic defense against invaders.

The construction of the castle was no small feat, taking nearly 90 years to complete, and the Venetian lord never saw its completion. Nonetheless, the fortress was completed in 1510 and played an essential role in Paxos' defense until 1797 when the French took control of the island. In 2025, the remains of the castle still stand proudly as a testament to the island’s rich history.

**Design and Structure of the Castle**

The design of the castle has an interesting historical connection to the genius of **Leonardo da Vinci**. According to research by architect **Roberto Veneris**, the design of Agios Nikolaos was influenced by Leonardo’s military designs, which were preserved in Venetian libraries. Though the roof of the castle is long gone, much of the structure remains intact. You can still explore the old gunpowder magazine, some cannons, the observatory, utility rooms, and even a deep well that still holds water.

Interestingly, while Agios Nikolaos Castle is the most famous fortress on Paxos, it’s not the only one. Another castle was built in Lakka, but sadly, it no longer exists today. The Agios Nikolaos fortress remains the island’s only surviving castle, and it offers visitors an incredible glimpse into Paxos’ past.

**Visiting Agios Nikolaos Island**

Agios Nikolaos Island is a lush, green paradise just a short distance from the bustling town of **Gaios**, the main port of Paxos. From Gaios, you can easily reach Agios Nikolaos by a small boat or even by swimming across the 50-meter-wide channel. The islet is just the right size for a day trip, offering both history and nature in abundance. You can hike up to the castle, take in panoramic views of the island, and explore the small chapel dedicated to Saint John.

After you’ve explored the castle, take some time to wander around the islet. The Mediterranean vegetation offers plenty of shady spots to relax and take in the stunning views of **Gaios** and the surrounding islands. The island is also home to an old windmill—another great spot for photos!

**How to Get to Agios Nikolaos**

The journey to Agios Nikolaos is quite simple. From wherever you're staying on Paxos, you can drive to Gaios in about 20 minutes. Parking is fairly easy, and you might even get lucky with a spot right near the water. Once you arrive, you can hire a small boat or simply swim across the channel to reach the island. For those who aren’t keen on swimming, there are local fishermen and boat captains who are happy to take you across for a small fee.

The island is small enough that you can easily explore it on foot. Flip-flops or comfortable shoes should be enough for the trek to the castle and around the islet.

**Things to Do After Visiting Agios Nikolaos Castle**

Once you’ve finished your visit to the castle, why not spend some time in **Gaios**? The town has plenty to offer, from quaint pedestrian streets lined with shops and boutiques to cafes serving delicious Greek coffee. In the summer months, you might even catch some of the events at the **Paxos Festival**—an excellent way to experience local music and culture. The festival typically runs throughout the summer, and you can expect concerts and exhibitions that showcase the island’s vibrant artistic scene.

For a more peaceful afternoon, wander to **Anilipsi Church**, a charming pink church with stunning icons. If you're looking to cool off, there are some great beaches near Gaios. **Gianna Beach**, located close to the harbor, is perfect for families. For a more secluded spot, head to **Kaki Langada Beach**, where you can rent sunbeds at the **Aeolus Beach Bar** and enjoy a refreshing drink while soaking up the sun.

**Where to Stay on Paxos**

Paxos is ideal for those looking to escape the usual tourist crowds. While there are a few hotels on the island, the best way to [experience Paxos is by staying in a villa](https://www.paxosglyfada.com/glyfada-beach-villa/), especially if you want some privacy. **Glyfada Beach Villas**, for example, offers a set of small villas with direct access to two beautiful beaches. This makes for a perfect base to explore both the island and the surrounding coastline at your own pace. Whether you're looking for seclusion or a lively vibe, Paxos offers a unique mix of both.

**Final Thoughts on Agios Nikolaos Castle**

Visiting **Agios Nikolaos Castle** was one of the highlights of my trip to Paxos. Its historical significance, combined with the breathtaking views and natural beauty of the surrounding area, made it a must-see spot on the island. Whether you're a history buff, a nature lover, or simply looking for a tranquil place to unwind, Agios Nikolaos Island has something for everyone. So, if you find yourself on Paxos in 2025, don’t miss the chance to experience this historical treasure firsthand!",1,1744092585.0,u_glyfadabeach,0,1.0,False

1ju6q2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/vtm/comments/1ju6q2o/tonight_i_had_the_best_payoff_for_a_plot_twist_id/,Tonight I had the best payoff for a plot twist I'd planned in may many years,"So, just wanted to share this since I'm very proud and hyped for what I achieved with my friends and players. Grab a coffee or tea, this WILL be a long ride.

I had planned for a big and impactful plot twist to be the season finale for our chronicle. 2/4 players are new to the system (1st chronicle) and another one hasn't played for many years. So I wanted them to end the 1st season feeling what the jyhad and being pieces on someones larger chess board really feals like. This is a Camarilla chronicle.

So I spent quite a few session observing their main goals, the plots they were more invested in, NPCs they liked or had a antagonistic relation to... and crossing this information with my personal notes about the goals and moves of major players in the cicy like primogens and court members. I always try to make my world a moving and breathing one so there's always stuff happening unrelated to the players that add to the development of the setting in parallel with the players actions and achievements.

Then, while doing this I noticed a possible way to achieve my goal of making them not only seeing the jyhad, but feeling it. And started working towards it.

The brujah of the group was being forced by the nosferatu primogen (through a major boon said brujah owned to her) to get something she could use to take over the position of the gangrel sherif.
But said sherif was not only a very cherished character of the group, but also an ally to some degree.
So they went their way to not only protect, but also double cross the nos primogen.
- I gladly indulged the behavior. -

The group unknowingly delivered a dhampir child to the prince, that made a horror scene spectacle of confirming the nature of the helpless child. Something that didn't stick well not only with the party but with the great majority of the kindred present. So the players (and a few of their characters) wanted to fix this by rescue the kid.
- I showed them that even though it would be very hard and risky... it was something they could work towards and achievable. -

They managed to capture three rogue kindred that were actively trying to breach the masquerade in the city and deliver to the prince. Both the nos primogen and the malkav one wanted their custody to use their talents and extract information from the rufians.
- And THAT was when I started directaly trying to align the pieces together. -

With the high humanity brujah character searching for info about the dhampir kid, they are approached by the malkav primogen (also keeper) with a proposition: make sure the primogen concil votes in my favor about the 3 rogue kindred and I'll give you all the info you need to plan a rescue for the kid.
After some convincing the coterie, they were in... and after a few sessions they managed to do it with merit!

So they get the info and after a tense and action packed heist... they rescued the kid. They even crossed with and third group also in a heist of the same vault complex to steal some other arctifact. This makes them suspect the breach in the security was not actually made for them, but just informed to them so they could exploit it while this 3rd group was executing their long and more elaborate plan.

Next night, an emergency court gathering is announced to decreate some serious deliberation. It is a tense night for them.

Next night, it is revealed that a precious vault of the domain was assauted, a war is declared, and a bloodhunt is called on the inside agent they uncovered plus anyone they find out helped.
Players are tense and mortified.
3 security camera footages show a corridor they passed and killed 2 guards with the bodies appearing in the screen and a figure gets into frame walking it... but it isnt the players characters. It is the nos primogen. EVERY PLAYER IS SURPRISED BY THIS. The sherif pouces towards the nos, but she manages to flee disapearing literaly in front of everyone.
The prince screams demanding her head.
End
Session

Now, players noticed that everything they did in the past week in game was ajusted just enough as to benefit some great plan of a powerful elder. They are scared of the malkav primogen, excited by the turntables and most importantly.... LOVED the twist.

As for me, I'm revigoated as a GM like I haven't been in almost a decade. The way they played and made it possible for me to deliver such a cool bit of story was such a delight. They are amazing and I love them and their characters.

So as a happy ST, I'm here sharing with you this cool moment we had. Sry for the bible of a post.

TLDR: Players pursued their own personal goals and found out the best players are always a piece in another player's larger board.",1,1744092331.0,vtm,0,1.0,False

I have been using V60 with Timemore Chestnut as a work setup for quite some time. Last year, I upgraded my home espresso kit, and that was a night and day difference. 

After that, I wanted to upgrade my filter experience, too, so I got the Stagg pour-over and immediately noticed the difference. I drink light fruity roasts, and the coffee tasted a lot sweeter, which I quite like. 

After much research, I decided to buy the legendary C40, which I have been using for about three months now. Taste-wise, the difference isn’t enough for me to warrant keeping it. If I get the right beans, I can make a great cup with either of the grinders. I just don’t like using it.

I don’t like the ergonomics. The grip is uncomfortable. I don’t have big hands, and I constantly feel like it’s going to slip, and I’ll drop the whole thing on the floor. Timemore feels so much nicer in my hand—smaller size and a nice texture.

The static drives me crazy. 

The threads on the cup are awful, and I would rather use a magnetic catch cup.

I packed my Timemore when travelling away last weekend, and it felt so much nicer to use. I immediately decided to sell the C40 and look for something else. It just doesn’t work for me. 

Should I look at 1zpresso or is there anything else that would fit the bill?

1ju6orb,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCCruises/comments/1ju6orb/msc_divina_review/,MSC Divina Review,"Just got off the MSC Divina! Wanted to post a little review since I always found these helpful prior to booking or boarding. This was my first MSC cruise, as I usually cruise Norwegian. Certainly had my concerns coming into the cruise given what I have read online, but figured you get what you pay for. Overall I had a great vacation with little complaints. Nonetheless, I kept my expectations tempered. 

  
Buffet: 

* Pros: Buffet was great. Was definitely able to identify the foods that we liked and stick with them and left every meal feeling happy and full. I'm a big pizza snob and thought that the pizza would be overrated, but I got pizza during every meal - it was that good. The cheeseburgers were quite good, even if they looked like cafeteria burgers. But overall it was easy to find the foods that you like. It was nice having bars in the buffet too. They were great with allergies, as they would bring out the chef to help identify exactly what you could and couldn't eat if you were allergic to something. 
* Cons: the scrambled eggs during breakfast sucked, but you can get hardboiled, omelet, or sunny side up instead. The soft serve machine had limited hours. 

Main Dining Room: 

* Not much to be said here, as we only went the first night and never went back. I'll start with the pros: the staff was great and very accomodating for allergies. The cons: the food. We are not picky eaters and we eat literally everything, but I'd have to agree with other reviews that the Black Crab MDR food was very subpar. The guests next to us got a NY Strip that was the saddest meat I've ever seen and definitely not cooked to how the guest ordered. We decided to hit the buffet for all other days due to the better food and flexible eating time instead. Was not a fan of the late dinner, as food took a long time to arrive as well. 

Drinks: 

* We had a drink package (easy plus) and was grandfathered into the old one prior to the change, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Would highly recommend the drink package even if you drink a moderate amount simply for the convenience. We got to try some drinks we otherwise would not order without feeling guilty. This also included all coffees, juices, protein shakes, Gatorades, Red Bulls, sodas, etc. The bartenders were fantastic. Understandably some bars got quite busy, but they did a great job making drinks. No complaints here. They don't have craft beers if you're into that, however. It was only light beers and Guinness. The package works on their private island which was great as well. The bar service staff were phenomenal as well. Get to know the bartenders - they will hit you up right and it was great to just get to know them as people. 

Entertainment: 

* We had previously read that there was subpar entertainment, but we thought it was phenomenal TBH. The theater had truly amazing performances and the comedian had us going back for more. The casino was great with reasonable minimums. There was always something going on if you checked the daily schedule, and we enjoyed trivia, gameshows, and the live music. Pools were great, and there was an adult only section as well which was nice. The waterslide kind of sucked though. Karaoke was super entertaining. We never got bored on the ship. I liked the idea of the White Night and enjoyed the theme, but the party at the pool deck was underwhelming. Just not the party that we were expecting but I think most people enjoyed it. 

Ship Environment: 

* Beautiful ship - MSC takes pride in its ships clearly. Overall it was pretty clean but some public bathrooms could definitely use a bit of renovation or better cleaning. Ship was otherwise gorgeous. I wish deck 7 was fully open - it would have been nice to walk around the entirety of the ship but not a big complaint. Gym was great and had most things that you could need. Loved the uniqueness of each section of the ship. Aside from the buffet at peak times, it did not feel too crowded. We really liked how the pool chairs had a top section that could be utilized to provide shade. 

Service: 

* Top notch. Room was very clean and staff would come in multiple times a day to get the room ready for us. They even folded some of our clothes on the bed! Very nice people, always smiling even though they were super long hours. No one was rude to us and everyone was very friendly and helpful. Any questions that we had were quickly answered. Really appreciate everyone on the ship. 

Ocean Cay: 

* Beautiful island. Drink package works here which is nice and they have multiple bars, although some close earlier than others. The buffet had limited hours and we only got to enjoy lunch on one day, but the food was very good. The water was beautiful and there was lots to do. We had an excursion get cancelled but got our refund easily. 

Logistics: 

* Embarkation and disembarkation were very quick, easy, and smooth. No issues here. You are allowed to walk off on your own any time during the disembarkation period provided you carry your own luggage, so we took advantage of that. 

Would I cruise with MSC again? Absolutely. We knew this was a cheaper cruise and the food may not be as good as other lines, but we had a great vacation nonetheless and did not break the bank. We are confident everyone can find some food that they enjoy (even if you avoid the MDR), and for a 5 day cruise, that is more than enough. The pizza was truly as good as advertised. If money was equal, I'd probably pick NCL over MSC, but it is hard to beat MSC's price point and what they offer. Book your cruise!",3,1744092179.0,MSCCruises,0,1.0,False

|4|8|Wolf 359|Life's not easy for Doug Eiffel, the communications officer for the U.S.S. Hephaestus Research Station, currently on Day 448 of its orbit around red dwarf star Wolf 359. He's stuck on a scientific survey mission of indeterminate length, 7.8 light years from Earth. His only company on board the station are stern mission chief Minkowski, insane science officer Hilbert, and Hephaestus Station's sentient, often malfunctioning operating system Hera. He doesn't have much to do for his job other than monitoring static and intercepting the occasional decades-old radio broadcast from Earth, so he spends most of his time creating extensive audio logs about the ordinary, day-to-day happenings within the station. But the Hephaestus is an odd place, and life in extremely isolated, zero gravity conditions has a way of doing funny things to people's minds. Even the simplest of tasks can turn into a gargantuan struggle, and the most ordinary-seeming things have a way of turning into anything but that. Wolf 359 is a radio drama in the tradition of Golden Age of Radio shows. Take one part space-faring adventure, add one part character drama, and mix in one part absurdist sitcom, and you get Wolf 359. New episodes are released every two weeks.|

1ju6l13,https://i.redd.it/heex415uvjte1.png,"StoreKitHelper: A lightweight StoreKit2 wrapper designed specifically for SwiftUI, aimed at simplifying the implementation of in-app purchases.","At the entry point of the SwiftUI application, create and inject a `StoreContext` instance, which is responsible for loading the product list and tracking purchase status.

👉 https://github.com/jaywcjlove/StoreKitHelper

```swift
import StoreKitHelper

enum AppProduct: String, CaseIterable, InAppProduct {
    case lifetime = ""focuscursor.lifetime""
    case monthly = ""focuscursor.monthly""
    var id: String { rawValue }
}

@main struct DevTutorApp: App {
    @StateObject var store = StoreContext(products: AppProduct.allCases)
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView().environmentObject(store)
        }
    }
}
```

Use `StoreKitHelperView` to directly display an in-app purchase popup view and configure various parameters through a chained API.

```swift
struct PurchaseContent: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var store: StoreContext
    var body: some View {
        StoreKitHelperView()
            .frame(maxWidth: 300)
            .frame(minWidth: 260)
            // Triggered when the popup is dismissed (e.g., user clicks the close button)
            .onPopupDismiss {
                store.isShowingPurchasePopup = false
            }
            // Sets the content area displayed in the purchase interface 
            // (can include feature descriptions, version comparisons, etc.)
            .pricingContent {
                AnyView(PricingContent())
            }
            .termsOfService {
                // Action triggered when the [Terms of Service] button is clicked
            }
            .privacyPolicy {
                // Action triggered when the [Privacy Policy] button is clicked
            }
    }
}
```

Click to open the paid product list interface.

```swift
struct PurchaseButton: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var store: StoreContext
    var body: some View {
        if store.hasNotPurchased == true {
            PurchasePopupButton()
                .sheet(isPresented: $store.isShowingPurchasePopup) {
                    /// Popup with the paid product list
                    PurchaseContent()
                }
        }
    }
}
```

You can use the `hasNotPurchased` property in `StoreContext` to check if the user has made a purchase, and then dynamically display different interface content. For example:

```swift
@EnvironmentObject var store: StoreContext

var body: some View {
    if store.hasNotPurchased == true {
        // 🧾 User has not purchased - Show restricted content or prompt for purchase
    } else {
        // ✅ User has purchased - Show full features
    }
}
```

I see a lot of men getting ahead by just knowing the right people in right places. I’ve worked my ass off, but I was never good at networking. 

Now, I have started reaching out to people on LinkedIn to setup calls for knowledge exchange. Or sometimes when I see a good opportunity at a great company, I reach out for referrals. 

The problem is, 70% of the time, the seniors are men, they end up hitting on me or saying they will discuss this over a coffee not an online meet. Or even for referrals, men say things like - if you get this job, you go out with me for dinner. 

I don’t even want to be rude to people. Initially I would tell them - this is inappropriate. So they would say things like - so you tell me, if someone had to approach someone at work with genuine feelings, how would they. My standard response is - I don’t know about others, but I don’t want to be approached at work. 

At this point, I am now spending extra time looking for women to network with. Sometimes there aren’t enough women in leadership roles. 


How do you all network for work, especially at senior level and how do you deal with this unwanted attention? I feel like it is holding me back work-wise.

Most ""heart health"" supplements are boring as fuck.

You take them because you know you should, not because you feel any difference.

At least that's what I thought until I tried Formulation Factory Heart of Steel.

I was looking for something to support my cardio since I started pushing harder in my training. Blood pressure was creeping up (thanks genetics), and recovery between sets was becoming an issue.

After 60 days of consistent use, here's what actually happened.

# Why I Chose Heart of Steel

First, the ingredients got my attention:

* Citrulline (1000mg) - The pump ingredient I already knew from pre-workouts
* L-Arginine (400mg) - Another nitric oxide booster
* Resveratrol (200mg) - The stuff in red wine everyone talks about
* Ginseng (200mg) - Energy and focus support
* Ginkgo Biloba (200mg) - Circulation booster
* Rhodiola Rosea (200mg) - Adaptogen for stress
* Coleus forskohlii (200mg) - Supposedly helps with blood pressure
* CoQ10 (150mg) - Cellular energy production
* Quercetin (150mg) - Anti-inflammatory
* Capsaicin (50mg) - Metabolism booster

The combo looked solid. Proper doses of ingredients I recognized, not just fairy dusted amounts.

# My Baseline Stats

Before starting:

* Resting heart rate: 72 bpm
* Blood pressure: 138/85
* Recovery time between heavy sets: \~2:30
* Energy crash: Usually by 2pm daily
* Endurance: Could do about 20 mins HIIT before gassing out

# 7 Unexpected Benefits I Experienced

# 1. Recovery between sets improved dramatically

By week 3, my rest periods between heavy sets dropped from 2:30 to about 1:45.

Doesn't sound like much, but it meant finishing workouts 15-20 minutes faster with the same volume.

The citrulline-arginine combo was likely responsible here. Better blood flow = faster recovery.

# 2. Morning brain fog disappeared

Wasn't expecting this at all.

Usually took me an hour and coffee to feel mentally ""online"" in the mornings.

Around day 25, I noticed I was waking up clearer. By day 40, morning mental fog was basically gone.

Ginkgo and rhodiola probably deserve credit here.

# 3. Blood pressure normalized

Started at 138/85 (borderline high).

After 60 days: 122/76.

This was the most measurable, objective benefit. My doc was impressed enough to ask what I changed.

# 4. Stress tolerance increased

Normally, work stress wrecks my training. Bad day at the office = shit workout.

About a month in, I noticed work stress wasn't bleeding into my gym time as much.

The adaptogenic effects of rhodiola and ginseng seem legit.

# 5. My endurance ceiling raised

Previously hit the wall at about 20 mins of HIIT.

By day 45, I could push to 30+ minutes before the same level of fatigue.

Wasn't expecting this much improvement, especially since I didn't change my cardio routine.

# 6. Better pumps (even on non-training days)

The nitric oxide benefits weren't just in the gym.

Vascularity improved even on rest days. Veins more visible, muscles looked fuller.

Not why I took it, but definitely a welcome side effect.

# 7. Energy levels stabilized

No more 2pm energy crashes.

Instead of the caffeine rollercoaster, my energy stayed consistent throughout the day.

CoQ10 plus the adaptogens probably contributed to this.

# Side Effects

Gotta keep it real:

* First week: Slight digestive discomfort (went away by day 10)
* Occasional face flushing from the niacin reaction (mostly after meals)
* Had to pee more frequently (increased blood flow effect)

Nothing serious or persistent.

# Was It Worth The Money?

At about $45 for a month supply, it's not cheap.

But considering I:

* Potentially avoided BP medication ($?)
* Finished workouts faster (time = money)
* Felt better overall (priceless)

I'd say it was worth it. I've spent way more on supplements that did way less.

# How It Compares To Others

I've tried a few heart/circulation supplements before:

* Regular CoQ10 - Subtle effects, nothing dramatic
* Standalone L-Arginine - Some pump effects but nothing like this
* Beet root extract - Decent for pumps but temporary

Heart of Steel worked better than any individual component alone. The synergy is real.

# Would I Recommend It?

If you:

* Are pushing your cardio limits
* Have borderline BP issues
* Need better recovery between sets
* Want better blood flow without stimulants

Then yeah, it's worth trying.

If you're just looking for a pre-workout effect, there are cheaper options.

# My Current Protocol

After seeing the results, I'm continuing with:

* Heart of Steel - 2 capsules daily with breakfast
* Extra 500mg Citrulline pre-workout
* Splitting doses (1 morning, 1 evening) on training days

Anyone else tried this? What were your results?

EDIT: Lots asking about stacking with pre-workouts. I take it 2 hours before my pre on training days to avoid overlap with stimulants.

EDIT 2: For those asking about my exact BP protocol - I take it with food to prevent any stomach discomfort.",1,1744090751.0,suppgains,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The Powers Gold Label Irish Whiskey boasts several defining characteristics that contribute to its unique flavor profile and overall experience.

**distillation Process:** Powers gold Label is primarily a pot still whiskey, a type of Irish whiskey made in copper pot stills. This customary method, involving triple distillation, contributes to the whiskey's smooth texture and concentrated flavors.

**Cask Maturation:** The spirit is aged in a combination of ex-bourbon barrels and sherry casks, imparting distinct flavors and aromas.The ex-bourbon barrels contribute vanilla, caramel, and honey notes, while the sherry casks introduce dried fruit, spice, and a hint of sweetness. This combination creates a balanced and complex flavor profile.

Happy Spring everyone 🌷,"I am heading to bed soon, but I would like to talk to some new people and share some info about me. I’m 32, fun, flirty, and smart. I live in New York City, but I am from the Midwest. I have been here for 10 years and love every minute of it. I’m into movies, theater, dancing, singing loudly, reading, hosting dinner parties, laughing too loud, and champagne for breakfast.  
I love hearts, pink, and white; fashion and traveling; and I could spend every day happily sitting in a bookstore café, sipping on a  iced chai latte, and reading a book or working on my laptop. Wanna guess what color I chose for my MacBook?


I’m open to voice chat as well, if we have good chemistry here.

Here’s what I’m seeking:

A person who might carry an umbrella but isn’t afraid to say, “Forget it, let’s enjoy the rain!” Someone who understands the difference between ""their"" and ""there."" Ideally, you live in the United States, speak English, and fall within the age range of 24 to 43.

You should feel equally at ease sipping coffee at a diner and dining at the finest restaurant in town—it's an essential quality in my eyes. Additionally, I’m looking for someone who loves to read and engage in book discussions, has a passion for music, and is open to exploring different genres (although I must confess, Heavy Metal and Bluegrass aren’t my favorites).

The appointment was on a Saturday but my wife got a text from the work friend on the Wednesday prior saying she’d be bringing the tattoo artist a coffee and not to get him one herself. Obviously my wife was confused because the agreed upon date was the upcoming Saturday so she asked the work friend if the tattoo appointment was still on Saturday, to which the work friend replies with, “No it’s today”. 

My wife works two jobs and had to work very hard to carve out any and all free time that is during the work week so this sudden change in schedule was inconvenient to say the least but also confusing because there was no warning or heads up of any sort. When my wife asked what happened the work friend just made attempts to console her on “forgetting the appointment” and it wasn’t my wife’s fault and no one was mad. 

Between my wife and I asking her wtf went wrong, the only truth I can carve out is this: sometime between when the appointment was made and the Wednesday in question, my work friend called/texted the tattoo artist about the appointment (Im assuming to change the date) and did not tell my wife, wether it was purposely or accidentally I cannot confirm. The work friend has claimed to ME she informed my wife that she was unavailable that weekend thus the change in appointment but we have no text evidence that she told my wife and my wife says she was never verbally told. When my wife explained how she felt hurt being so left out of the loop my work friend just reacted “👍🏻” to her message with no sort of apology or explanation. Even the tattoo artist has since reached out to apologize about the situation. 

My wife and I are hurt to say the least. My wife views getting tattoos together as a very close-friend thing to do and to back out of it with no warning or explanation and hiding behind lies hurts. We always treated her like a friend and made memories with her and for her to seem so inconsiderate of my wife’s time and feelings is so confusing. I don’t know what to do because I hate conflict and I feel like if I straight up say, “You’re lying” it will be a whole dramatic blow up that i’d like to avoid. And the work friend talks to me as if nothing happened. She send me memes and jokes while she hasn’t spoken or texted my wife since she explained how hurt she felt. And coincidentally the work friend works earlier shifts now and doesn’t overlap shifts with me when we used to work closings together.

# 40 ⁣oz Water Bottle ⁤Showdown (2025): Top Brands Compared &⁢ Reviewed!

Staying hydrated is a cornerstone of⁣ a healthy lifestyle. Whether you're crushing ⁤it at the gym, conquering a mountain ⁣trail, or powering through a long day at the office, a reliable water bottle is an essential companion. In the battle for⁢ optimal hydration,the 40 oz water bottle reigns supreme for its generous capacity and convenience. But with a seemingly endless array of brands and features, choosing⁣ the right one can feel overwhelming. Fear not! This 2025 deep dive compares‍ and reviews the top 40 oz water ​bottles on the market, helping⁤ you​ find the perfect fit for your needs.

## Why Choose⁤ a 40 oz Water Bottle?

Before we dive into the ​specific brands,‍ let's address the elephant in the room: why opt⁣ for a 40 oz water bottle in ⁣the first place? The answer lies in convenience and hydration goals. For health-conscious individuals aiming to meet their ⁤daily water intake ⁣goals,a large water bottle 40 oz often‌ removes the need for constant refills. This is especially ⁣beneficial ‌for fitness enthusiasts engaged in intense workouts or outdoor adventurers embarking on‍ long hikes. A⁣ large water bottle 40 oz reduces the risk of dehydration and ensures you have ample water readily available. Moreover, for ‌those‍ constantly on the​ go - students‍ or professionals - a 40 oz water bottle fits the bill perfectly,⁤ minimizing interruptions for refills and promoting consistent hydration throughout the day.

## Understanding the key Features: What to Look For

Not ​all 40 oz water bottles are created equal. Key features differentiate them and​ determine ​their suitability for various lifestyles. Consider these factors before​ making your purchase:

### Insulation: Keeping It Cold (or ​Hot!)

The ability to maintain temperature is paramount.‍ A 40 oz insulated water bottle is a game-changer, keeping your ⁤water refreshingly cold for hours (and your coffee piping hot,​ if that's your preference). Look for bottles with double-walled vacuum insulation, a feature common in high-quality 40 oz stainless steel water bottles. This technology minimizes temperature transfer, ensuring your drink stays at your desired temperature.

### Material: Stainless Steel vs.‍ Others

Stainless steel is ⁤the gold standard⁢ for 40 oz water ⁢bottles. It's durable, resistant to odors and bacteria, and doesn't leach harmful chemicals into ‌your​ drink. While other materials like plastic and glass exist, stainless ​steel offers the best balance of safety, durability, and insulation.

### Lid and mouth Design: ‍Sipping ​made Simple

The lid ‌design can significantly impact your drinking experience. Do you prefer a wide mouth for easy filling and cleaning, or a​ straw lid for convenient sipping on the go?

It’s complicated, what should I do?","I [49M] have a crush on my coworker [32F]. It’s complicated so the post will be long, please bear with me. TL;DR at the end.

Please note that I am in europe and workplace dating is considered OK if you don’t have a dependency between the two parties (i. e. boss and subordinate or the like)

We have been working together closely for three years now. I have always found her attractive but since I was married I did not even think about anything romantic. She had a boyfriend but broke up with him last november.

In early december we had a team celebration lunch and my coworker was eye fucking me the whole time. there is no other word. It created the impression in me that she might have feelings for me. That is where I discovered that I did in fact have feelings for her as well. This episode was a single event and there was no other indication of feelings between us for the time being.

In any event, without giving all the details,I broke up with my wife on March 14 and asked for a divorce. I intentionally told my coworker as a personal comment during an informal one on one meeting. Her reaction was astonishingly positive (everyone else said „I‘m sorry for you“, she said „good for you“).  She seemed almost euphoric and gave me lots of advice. I thanked her for her help and invited her to lunch or dinner officially to say thank you but also to test the waters. she said yes and wanted to go on a weekend (she works long hours, different from mine) but she was genuinely unavailable the next two weeks.  I told her to let me know when since I did not want to push things beyond being friendly at this point (plausible deniability).

the following week I got lots of intense eye contact and huge smiles from her. She would stop at my office door in the morning and present herself smiling. I had the impression that she was dressing up for me and tried to sit next to me during meetings. this caught me by surprise and that is when my feelings erupted into a full blown crush. I tried to reciprocate with smiles and more eye contact.

the following week she would just pass by my office and say „hello“ without looking at me. We still had lots of eye contact when we talked and I could see from her behavior that she has feelings for me. There were lots of situations which would have been slightly inappropriate or weird with other coworkers.

I repeated my invitation once but she still wasn’t available. she is currently traveling for work so it’s not just an excuse. starting saturday I am on vacation for ten days (which she knows) so she just said „don’t worry, we‘ll make it“.

I saw her twice in the last few days and now she is acting cold and distant. no eye contact and a 100% professional behavior. she still asked me if I come for lunch with the team and bought me coffee.

but at this point I am gasping for straws. Of course I am devastated because I am under the impression that I had a chance and blew it. I am constantly wondering what is going on and if I did anything wrong. my divorce is going „great“ (my wife agrees and is currently moving out, the papers are being written) but obviously it still creates turmoil and I am in no way emotionally stable which doesn’t help.

I am at a loss on how to proceed and what I should even think of this mess. Anyadvice would be appreciated.

I've been a frequent lurker here for a while as this part of the process always intrigued me more than coffee itself.
It's also very inspiring to visit different old coffee forums like homeroasting, homebarista.

So I wish to take a plunge.
More interested in building a roaster myself before roasting and all these forums led me to very interesting way to build a DIY Frankenstein fluidbed roaster with air blower, heat gun heating element and basic circuit to have a artisan compatible roaster.

I'm very much tempted to try this.
Already sourcing the things.

However there are few concerns.

The most important one is fire hazard.
Especially the chaff.
I would like to try my best to Avoid that at all cost.
Initially I will not be making a chaff collector and will use ducting pipe to get the smoke and chaff out.

This is my first ever DIY project and I'm not a technically sound person (engineering and physics is not my field). However I have tendency to understand the logic once I start to learn things. So it will take me quite some time to even make this.
I have found numerous sources and very detailed information about how people went on about making their roaster this way.

I first initially thought I would start with popcorn popper or breadmaker heatgun combo but again I'm sort of very afraid of fire hazard.

This seems like a bit of work, but atleast seems bit more safe and also more consistent.

I do not know alot about roasting. out of curiosity I've seen few videos from youtube channels like mill city roasters. A lot of information, but most of it was about drum roasters. And as I found out, there are a lot of difference between fluidbed toasters like I'm trying to make and drum roasters.
Especially in such small scale.

I live in India, and it seems sourcing green bean seems to be task here, atleast in cheaper prices.
Most of the good quality green beans I find online are actually as costly as the roasted beans I'm consuming right now. Although after a bit of fiddling I might be able to find a cheaper source.

So I guess I would like to ask in this subreddit is that...
How people who have gone through this route prevented risk of fire.
How did they even start?
I don't mind taking my sweet time in building this.
At this point, I'm more intrigued at the idea of making this kind of roaster than roasting itself.

And is there anyone from India here, who did something similar ?
The fact that I'm doing this is because home roasters are not easily available in India.
Even SR800 is crazy expensive by indian standards. Something like this is quite cheap and has a future potential to turn into some kind of product. (Very unlikely)

1ju5wq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ju5wq7/aitah_for_being_an_emotionally_and_financially/,"AITAH for being an emotionally and financially manipulative, and just overall a POS boyfriend?","TLDR: I need the internet to tell me to get my shit together. My girlfriend is amazing and really hard working but I don’t put any effort into our relationship and put financial pressure on her for no reason other than my own insecurity. 

Preface: I am the A-hole. As the title states I (22M) am emotionally and financially manipulative towards my long distance (3-hour car drive) (22F) girlfriend of nearly 3-years due largely to what I believe to be immaturity and a slew of personal issues that I have with both myself and my family (note: this is just me speculating on myself, I do not attend therapy though I think this should really be a first step in fixing this and other issues). I want to be a better person and honestly just don’t know why I’m not making the necessary changes.

I’ll start with my girlfriend. 
All in all, she’s amazing, beautiful, a super kind and generous person who if she has $20, everyone has $20. 
She’s a full time student in her final semester of college while working a part time job to pay her expenses. She works extremely hard at both of these while also making sure to have time for our dog taking the time to hang out with her friends, have hobbies, and to top it all off, she makes sure to make sure our relationship and myself are happy and taken care of (buying/making gifts, planning surprises, picking new restaurants, etc).
She used to do more to make our relationship special like leaving love notes, surprise candy and stuffed animal, planning dates, but she stopped almost altogether after I did almost nothing to reciprocate/return any of this effort and care. I took these things for granted and they went away. She’s made it abundantly clear what she needs from me in our relationship (plan some dates, buy/make her small gifts to let her know I’m thinking of her, honestly just anything to show that I care) and I did almost nothing. Before we started dating and at the very beginning of our relationship I did try, and I was doing the things that she’s asking of me not because she was asking (she hadn’t asked for any of this yet) but because I wanted to and knew it would make her happy. But after we started dating I got lazy, complacent, and now it’s a rare occurrence that I so much as bring her flowers when I come to see her every couple weeks.

We frequently get into “arguments” where she comes to me with what is always a very, for lack of better verbiage, valid issue. It’s almost always something she has come to me with before and that I said I would fix/ improve upon. The problem is, I tend to shut down and get really defensive and just end up apologizing. As I said above, I pulled back almost immediately when we started dating and this has cause a ton of issues with her not feeling valued, acknowledged, loved, and respected. These issues are furthered when I do my best to end these conversations as fast as possible by apologizing and saying that I’ll do better and then proceed to do the exact same thing that I said I would fix. 
Honestly I don’t know how to fix this. I know I’m being dismissive of these things that I know are major issues that I have and need to fix if 1. I want to keep our relationship. 2. Simply want to stop being such a terrible person. 
Focusing on the financial manipulation, I make $60k per year in an office job while my girlfriend makes probably close to 8k. While being a full time student. 
She pays her own rent/utilities, pays for our dog almost entirely (I only help with unexpected bills usually related to the vet), purchased the vast majority of items for our apartment (we live together for a year prior to being long distance), and to top it all off she’s extremely generous when it comes to gifts/dinners for big events like birthdays and graduations (not just for me but for my younger brother!).
I on the other hand, pay for my student loans, car insurance, vet plan for our cat, live rent free with and have meals made for me by HER PARENTS, and otherwise have no expenses other than going to visit her every other weekend.
The differences between our bills and in the amount we make are not the problem, the problem is that I act like I’m equally broke if not more so that she is. I complain about spending money like it’s my job and make her feel guilty for wanting to go out on dates, get coffee in the mornings when I’m there, pay for anything for OUR DOG, etc. Overall, I make her feel like shit for not being able to split the weekends and anything else 50/50 with me. I know this is ridiculous. I know that I need to change my perspective from her expenses being unrelated to mine and that when we’re together, it should be even. I know that I’m in the position to at a bare minimum, cover the expenses when we’re together and not complain about it. But i always, without fail, complain about spending money and blame her.
I don’t want to be this person. I don’t want to be the person who only care about themselves and makes her feel like shit for being a full time student with responsibilities. I want to be the person she can ask for help from without feeling like I’m going to complain about it.

1ju5wo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1ju5wo1/afraid_of_the_future/,Afraid of the future,"Maybe just the ramblings of an 18 year old.

I’m just less than two months from graduating, and I think I’m at a point in my life which most people would call *what do I do with my life?*.

7 months ago when I was still 17 I had signed up for the military and I was proud of it.  For one, I had gotten into a highly-wanted program, so I signed a bonus of $70k.  For another, I was just simply proud I had actually shot for something and done it, seeing as I’ve never been the type of person to go with my gut.  

Well a few weeks ago I got my acceptance letters from a few colleges.  And now my gut is telling me I’m making a truly great mistake going to the military.

I don’t want to buy into fear.  Fear is the mind-killer, after all (hehe).  But college feels safe.  Something I know.  All my cousins have gone to college.  All my friends are going, some to the ones I’ve been accepted to.   My entire life I’ve been told by family and relatives and their relatives that college is the key to my future.  Being in an Asian immigrant family, it’s emphasized all the more.  Practice SATs, tutors.  My parents weren’t dealt an easy card coming here, and they were damn sure it wouldn’t be the same for me.   All this to say, I’m comfortable with college.  Or at least the idea of it.  I know how to sit in a classroom, how to hold a pen and write down notes I’ll read just before a test.  How to do just enough to get a good grade.  How to study with one eye open.  Study with a headache.  

But if there’s ever a reason for why I do something, I never want it to be because I was simply comfortable with it.  

I joined the military because I wanted to be independent.  And I still do.  I want to make money.  I know the field I’m going in translates well after service.  I want be my own man, so to speak.  I want to support my family, while also being away from them, because I’ve also realized I’m happier when I’m away from them.  I live with my grandma.  She’s old and grumpy.  Most old people are.  I don’t blame that in her.  But she gets mad a lot, even when I have done nothing wrong.  And often, she divulges into the wish that me and my brother would leave forever.  I know she doesn’t really mean it, that it is just anger, that actions do speak louder than words.  Otherwise, she wouldn’t wake up early every morning to make us coffee, give us food, or worry about every single problem in our lives.  

However, I’ve also come to realize that that wish is still there.  A part of her, no matter how much she tries to suppress it.  

I joined to make that wish come true.  For her and also myself.  I think my want for independence is my revulsion for being a burden.  It makes me feel guilty and worthless.  I know that if I go to college, I’ll be a burden for the next 4 years.  If I dorm, my family will have to find money for it, and my money will be a burden.  If I commute, I’ll live with my grandma, and I’ll be a burden for just existing.

I wish life wasn’t so wobbly.  I wish everything had been set in stone for me, and I could walk along the path with no regrets knowing I could’ve done nothing to change my future.  College and the military are so different from each other.  But I’m not old enough to tell the difference.  And I feel I’m not old enough to decide.

I want to go with my heart, and that is the military.  But I don’t want to be that thirty old man wishing he could turn back time.  I think I’m lost, so I would appreciate any advice that could help me.

That hoodie looks like it's seen more emotional breakdowns than a therapy office.
And that haircut? It’s not a fade, it’s more like your barber just gave up halfway through and said, “Nature will finish the job.”

Appreciate the confidence though—takes guts to post a selfie that screams midlife crisis meets gas station coffee enthusiast.

You look like you just woke up from a nap you didn’t deserve. That face says, “I’ve made peace with my poor decisions… but barely.”
The wrinkles on your forehead look like they're trying to escape your thoughts before they have to hear another one of your bad ideas.
That 3-day shadow on your chin? More like your beard saw your face and decided not to fully commit.

Your hoodie has more lint than your resume has accomplishments, and that tag poking out? Bro, your outfit's trying to run away from you too.

You’ve got “dad who lost custody and the remote” energy written all over you.
But hey, it takes a special kind of bravery to look like a character from a low-budget reality show called “Why Me?”

You look like the human version of a slow Wi-Fi connection—always there, never quite working right.
Your face says, “I’ve been through things,” but your eyes say, “I forgot what those things were.”
That confused expression? Like someone just told you the Earth isn't flat and now your whole belief system is crumbling.

That haircut… it’s giving DIY with dull scissors during a power outage. You didn’t get a fade—you got a buffering error.

Your double chin’s got better layering than most winter coats, and that neck crease? Looks like it’s storing secrets from 2006.

Your hoodie is covered in so much lint, it’s practically a pet. I bet it sheds more than your self-esteem after reading this.

You look like the kind of guy who’d lose a staring contest with a mirror.
If disappointment had a face, it’d be using yours as its profile pic.

You look like your spirit animal is a forgotten grocery list.
That expression? Like someone just asked you to spell “gym” and you panicked.
Your face screams, “I peaked in 8th grade,” and even then, it was a tie with the janitor.

You’ve got the posture of a man who’s been dodging responsibilities since ‘03.
Your hairline’s retreating faster than your ambition, and your scalp is throwing a farewell tour.
That patchy stubble? It's not “rugged”—it's what happens when puberty files a restraining order.

Your hoodie looks like it’s been washed more times than you’ve washed your hands in 2020.
You’ve got that “I sleep in my car but still blame the economy” vibe.

You look like you charge your phone at gas stations and tell people you’re “between jobs” when the real job was never showing up in the first place.

If self-doubt were a person, it’d wear your face like a badge of honor.

You look like you were assembled at a garage sale and left in the rain.
That expression? It’s like your brain got a loading screen and it’s been stuck at 9% since 2017.
You’ve got “tech support scam victim” written all over you—twice.

Your hairline’s doing the cha-cha-slide straight off your scalp, and that buzzcut? It’s less “style” and more “court-ordered fresh start.”
You don’t have a five o’clock shadow—you’ve got a “I gave up at 4:37 and just let life win” shadow.
That face has more missed opportunities than a Blockbuster franchise.

You dress like you lost a bet and your dignity.
That hoodie’s got more pills than a retirement home, and the tag sticking out? Even your clothes are trying to distance themselves from you.

You look like you were kicked out of a vape shop for being “too sad.”
Your vibe screams “divorced, but it was her dog and her house.”

Your neck folds are storing more secrets than the Pentagon, and your whole aura gives off “I peaked during the MySpace era.”

If rock bottom had a promotional poster, your selfie would be front and center, captioned: “Still Digging.”

You look like you moisturize with expired ranch dressing.
That selfie has more red flags than a toxic ex’s group chat.
Your whole aura says “I give unsolicited advice at bus stops.”

You look like you tell people you're “working on yourself” but the only thing you've worked on is your Uber Eats loyalty status.
That haircut? Bro, it looks like you used a lawnmower with commitment issues.

Your beard’s so patchy, even your chin gave up and said, “This ain't worth it.”
You’ve got the fashion sense of a middle schooler who just discovered Hot Topic... in 2025.
That hoodie? It's so worn out it qualifies as a historical artifact. Pretty sure archaeologists would dig it up and say, “Ah, yes—the Great Depression 2.0.”

You look like you’ve been through four breakups, two personality changes, and a failed pyramid scheme all before breakfast.
Your face says, “Trust me,” but your vibe says, “I once got scammed by a free trial.”

You give off the energy of someone who says “Let me cook,” then sets off the smoke alarm making cereal.
If disappointment had a holiday, your selfie would be the greeting card.

At this point, you’re not just down bad—you’re the spokesperson for it.

But hey, props for the confidence—it takes serious guts to request a full roast and keep asking for more like a gladiator of self-burns.

Hey Redditors,

I have been pondering on the topic ""."" and I would love to have a thought-provoking discussion with all of you. So, grab your coffee or popcorn, sit back, and let's dive into this intriguing subject.

• What is the meaning behind "".""?
We often find ourselves searching for meaning and purpose in life, but sometimes it feels like we are staring at a blank canvas. ""."" represents that elusive sense of emptiness or the unknown that we encounter in our lives. It can be interpreted as a symbol for the absence of clarity or direction.

• The power of ""."" in decision-making:
Think about the moments in life when you are faced with significant choices - a career path, a relationship, or even what to order for lunch. ""."" lurks in the shadows, reminding us of the uncertainties that come with making decisions. It reminds us that sometimes we have to navigate uncharted territories without a clear road map.

• ""."": An opportunity for creative exploration:
At first glance, ""."" might seem like nothingness, but what if we learn to embrace it rather than fearing it? The absence of predefined paths can be seen as an opportunity for creative discovery. When faced with a blank canvas, painters imagine vivid landscapes; when faced with a blank page, writers pen tales of imagination. ""."": the catalyst for innovation and ingenuity.

• The psychological impact of ""."":
We know that uncertainties can trigger anxiety, stress, and restlessness. When we encounter ""."", we might feel adrift or lost. However, it's essential to remember that ""."" is an inherent aspect of life. It is through navigating the unknown that we develop resilience and find our true selves. Viewing ""."" as a chance for personal growth can lead to a more enriching experience.

I'm really lost, so I thought I'd ask you guys and see if it brings me any clarity.

I (29m) have been in a serious relationship with (28f) for 3.5 years. I have had lots of relationships but I believed she was the one for me and every day I would wake up happy to be with her. 

Recently I found out she has been texting with a much older man that she studies with. She does a course once a month that it a few hours from our home town. He does the course too. 

Things between her and him have grown over the last few months to the point where they are texting all the time, sometimes flirting, sending selfies etc. Nothing sexual that I have found out. During this time our relationship has been really tough and we've been trying to work through it together, but I had no idea about this until I caught her out on it recently. 

This is where the main issue for me started. She began by saying it was just normal texting and he is a friend. She said she has never met up with him or anything like that outside of lectures. Then after a while of us arguing she admits that the last weekend she did actually meet him, but just for coffee. Then more arguing happens and after promising me that's all she then says she met him that night in a club too, and they danced together. She promises me that is it and then again I learn they met for coffee two more times that weekend just the two of them. 

The issue for me is not the meeting, but it's the lying and the hiding it from me. She has many boy friends, and I have never expressed any issues towards it, I have always trusted her completely and never been paranoid or anything like that. 

If I hadn't called her out on it, she never would have told me anything. She claims she didn't say because although she knew it was wrong, she thought that soon they would just become friends, but I am finding that really hard to believe. 

Where do I go from here friends? We've said we're gonna try couples therapy, but I just feel so lost.

The coffee’s cold. Again. The screen glares. And somewhere in the house, a printer whirrs like it knows we're still scanning our way to salvation. But tonight… tonight we feel the echoes.

Welcome back to the place between sleep and scriptwriting, where stories linger like static in the grey.Settle in—this is a two-minute walk through memory, and maybe something more.

This week, the chorus grew louder.

We officially launched the Reader Voices section of the website—a space for those who’ve wandered the grey world, survived it, and returned with something to say.
Reviews. Messages. Recollections. These aren’t just sweet nothings—they’re the lifeblood of adaptation.

Producers want proof that people care.Directors need to feel the world waiting for them.And we? We want to build the Grey World together.

You see what we miss.You remember what we’ve forgotten.You carry the echoes in your own voice.
This story was never meant to be resurrected alone.

And then came the podcast.

This week, Maddie joined Mike Davis and his brilliant crew on the Lovecraft eZine Podcast. What followed was something rare—a raw, resonant, and profoundly personal episode about Displaced Person, cosmic horror, and the memory of a father who saw the future before it arrived.

“Speaking with Mike felt like a portal back to my dad,” she said.

And then came something even deeper.

“It was only when I was talking to Mike,” Maddie admitted, “that I realised how much I actually know about this book... about him. How much it shaped me, even when I didn’t want to admit it.”

In that moment, something shifted.
A daughter no longer speaking about her father’s work, but with it—through it.And the story became more than a legacy.It became alive.

The conversation spiralled beautifully—through Aussie horror classics like Wake in Fright, Talk to Me, and Wolf Creek. Maddie, true to form, reached deep into the cult vault, name-dropping obscure titles from 1971, prompting laughter from the crew as she pulled back the curtain on Australian genre cinema’s particular flavour of dread.

From there, they drifted into cosmic horror territory, trading notes on favourites like Donnie Darko, The Thing, and 2001: A Space Odyssey—where fear isn’t found in jump scares, but in the existential quiet. In the silence of space. In the slow unravelling of identity. In the things we can’t explain but know are coming.

They talked about isolation.About how Displaced Person was written before the internet, before the pandemic—yet somehow still speaks to our fractured, modern lives.About how the story now feels less like fiction…and more like a quiet warning we didn’t hear in time.

And then came a moment.A dropped detail that made everyone pause—Lee Harding coined the phrase “the interface” in 1961, in the original short story version of Displaced Person.

Nineteen sixty-one.Before personal computers. Before cyberspace.Before Gibson’s Matrix.

Harding imagined a grey realm between realities, navigated through an invisible threshold—an interface—where people disappeared after becoming unmoored from their lives.

Prophetic doesn’t even cover it.It’s a revelation.

And in that moment, the podcast became what all great conversations eventually become—a séance with truth.

If you haven’t heard the episode yet, you need to.

Not just for the celebration of Displaced Person, but because it lays bare why stories like this matter more than ever.
And why we need your help to bring it to the screen.

🎬 We’re applying to Screen Australia in November.Your reviews, your messages, your support—it all becomes evidence.

That this book isn’t just remembered.It’s revered.It’s still speaking.And it wants to be seen.

We’re building it with you.

I am going to be living off campus for the first time and will be living with three other people, one of which being my current roommate this year. We have always gotten along extremely well without a single issue. In addition to my current roommate (let’s call her Gloria) I am living with 2 other people, we’ll call them Haley and Stella. Both of them I met through Gloria and we were very excited to live together. Leases have been signed etc. 

Now that we’re getting closer to the summer I thought it would be smart to start thinking about what we would need for the apartment, as we all have fully furnished rooms but are sharing one kitchen together. My grandpa is into cooking and was kind enough to send me a bunch of pots and pans so I thought I should create a list to start crossing off what we already have. I copied and pasted a list of “what to get for an apartment” online and put it into google sheets. This included spices, utensils, some utilities like a coffee maker, etc. Nothing too crazy or extensive. I then shared it with my three future roommates in a group chat specifically saying that this was just a starting point to see what we might need to get for the kitchen over the summer and it’s totally flexible. I did this with my current roommate Gloria for the vacuum and fridge etc. and it totally worked out great! 

But the other day, I heard from several mutual friends that Haley and Stella were “furious” about the list and that they thought it was completely unreasonable. It is mostly Stella leading the charge. Keep in mind, I mentioned this isn’t what’s “expected” or anything, just a starting point since we’ll need to buy a bunch of stuff to be able to cook food since we’re off the dining plan next year and we don’t want to do it last minute. I don’t even drink coffee! I don’t need a coffee maker! Apparently, Stella doesn’t plan on sharing and wants to bring all her own pots, pans, utensils, and other supplies and was appalled at the idea of sharing (she is an only child btw). We got together to chat about it since I heard she was pretty upset, even though she and Haley expressed great enthusiasm for the list in the group chat. She refused to apologize and still thinks I messed up big time. I’m just so beyond confused about the lack of communication about the list, and it seems very out of character for both. I’ve never had any issues with the two and was genuinely so excited to room live with them. They should know me well enough that I wouldn’t do anything malicious!

Between unreliable signals, painfully slow speeds, and security risks, I started looking into better ways to stay connected while traveling. That’s how I stumbled into the world of **portable mobile WiFi devices**, and more specifically, the **MUAMA Ryoko WiFi**.

I’ve been using it for several months now on weekend trips, flights, and even just working from parks or coffee shops—and I’m surprised how useful it’s become.

**Why Portable WiFi?**

Public WiFi networks are usually a mess. You either need to sign up for something, agree to sketchy terms, or deal with painfully slow speeds. Using my phone as a hotspot helped, but it drained my battery like crazy and would sometimes drop out during longer sessions.

That’s when I decided to try a **portable WiFi hotspot**—something separate from my phone, that I could use when I needed reliable, private internet without burning through my data plan.

**What is MUAMA Ryoko WiFi?**

It’s a **4G LTE portable hotspot** that works in over **76 countries**. It comes unlocked, which means you can use your own SIM if you want, but it also comes with a pre-installed SIM and 500MB to get you started.

No contracts, no monthly fees unless you want them. You just top up with what you need.

It supports up to **8 devices at once**, which is more than enough for me. I usually connect my laptop and phone, and sometimes my tablet too.

You can check out full details here:  
[**MUAMA Ryoko WiFi Official Info**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/WC9TFJH/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/CoolNewGadgets)

**How Well Does It Work?**

Short answer: better than I expected.

Speeds are solid—usually **40–80 Mbps** in cities, sometimes higher. I used it while staying in a mountain Airbnb where the cabin had no WiFi, and I was still able to stream Netflix and take work calls without issues.

The battery lasts about **12–15 hours**, and it charges via USB-C. I throw it in my bag with my power bank and forget it’s even there.

Another thing I noticed: the signal is more stable than my phone’s hotspot. It doesn’t randomly disconnect, which used to drive me nuts during Zoom calls.

**Data Packages and Cost**

Once the initial 500MB runs out, you can top up online. Prices vary, but it’s usually around **$5 per GB**, and bigger bundles (like 10GB or 20GB) are cheaper per GB.

What I really like is that the data doesn’t expire each month. So if I buy 10GB and only use 4GB on a trip, the remaining 6GB is still available later.

Here’s the link I used to grab data bundles:  
[**Ryoko WiFi Data Options**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/WC9TFJH/?uid=4362&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/CoolNewGadgets)

**What It’s Great For**

* **Remote work:** I’ve used it in cars, parks, hotel rooms, and even while camping.
* **International travel:** No roaming charges. It just finds the best local network automatically.
* **Emergency backup:** When my home internet went out during a storm, Ryoko kept me online.
* **Families or groups:** 8-device support means others can connect too.

**A Few Downsides**

* It’s **not 5G**, just 4G LTE. Speeds are still solid, but if you’re chasing the absolute fastest connection, keep that in mind.
* There’s **no display screen**, so you need to log in to check data usage or signal strength.
* The included SIM is mostly tied to the device—can’t just pop it into your phone and use it there.

**Final Thoughts**

If you’re looking for a flexible, secure, and portable way to stay connected while traveling, I think **Ryoko WiFi** is one of the better options out there. It’s not a home internet replacement, but it fills the gap between sketchy public WiFi and expensive data plans.

I use it way more than I expected to—and not just when I’m away. Sometimes I even use it at home if my main connection is acting up.

Happy to answer questions or hear what other people are using! Always curious if anyone’s found something better or has cool use cases.",1,1744087472.0,CoolNewGadgets,0,1.0,False

Background: 
I (Tina) have been best friends with my “former”bestie Paige since elementary school. We have a friend group consisting of my “former” best friend Paige, her boyfriend, Gary (M), me, Tina (F), my boyfriend, Kole (M), and our two other friends Brian (M) and Dana (F)(not a couple). This friend group has been friends since high school, we are now all 22. Back in October, we decided to meet up for another hang out for a combined birthday get together thing for me and my best friend. It was hosted at my best friend and her boyfriend’s apartment. We all made a plan to bring 2 things for a “potluck”. It started off fine, we ate, hung out and just chilled like normal. We didn’t really drink (except Paige) and I genuinely think that was the issue even if she denies it. 

Mind you, I got there at like 3p, like 3 hours before the “start” time to exchange birthday gifts with my Paige. I gave her well over $1000 worth of gifts because I am a gift giver and I just always loved to spoil her. So that was fine, we exchanged gifts, blah blah. Then when everyone else was there- we all ate a bunch of food and were just talking. Hours past- we were just chilling still, we played a couple games but overall it was just chill (nothing crazy- no drinking, no screaming and being loud). Around maybe 11-midnight, Paige randomly stormed upstairs to her bedroom and never came back down. So everyone else were still downstairs and were on our phones and the boys were playing video games. We all asked Gary like “what’s up with her” “is she okay” and he said “yeah she’s fine, she said she was going to sleep” like okay that’s fine. We stuck around for another hour or so and we’re all just ready to leave at that point. I helped clean up and then me and kole went on our way after Brian and Dana left. I didn’t think too much of this encounter because every time she drinks, she ends the night mad or crying. 

The day after that night, Paige started sending me blank snapchats (we normally send videos on snap back and forth), and she texted our group chat something like “I’m not interested in doing a secret Santa/ white elephant anymore” which I responded “okay drama” and that was the end of that but I think that pissed her off. The next day I texted her personally and asked her what’s wrong. And she responded that she’s just tired of putting in so much effort for the same results and she’s chasing memories of our friend group from sophomore year of college so she’s taking a step back. 

So I got sassy with her (which I have never done, I always support her and defend her but I just started my period that day and I was not in the mood). Here is a summary of our text thread. 

Me: what are you talking about? Gary said you went to sleep we weren’t gonna wait down there for a few hours without you down there with us 

Her: the vibe was gone before I went upstairs

Me: people were tired and not in the mood of what you wanted them to be, because we weren’t jumping up and down screaming, you’re gonna cut everyone off. Makes sense. 

Her: this is not a unique experience, this happens every time. I literally said nothing about cutting everyone off, I said I’m taking a step back 

Me: cancelling Christmas plans with the group is cutting them off. What do you mean it happens every time? 

Her: Christmas plans that I made. Actually I make every plan in that group. I’m the only one who tries to keep it together. So no, I’m not cutting everyone off. I’m taking a step back. And if it falls apart it falls apart. I can’t be the only one ever making an effort to keep high school friends together. 

Me: I don’t know what triggered this but okay 

Her: I’m literally saying what triggered this to you. I’m speaking my feelings and you immediately turned it back on me and how I’m the crazy one. 

Me: girl you are the crazy one. You stormed upstairs to go pout, what did you want us to do? You have only sent caption less face snaps to me as a “fuck you” for what reason. I don’t know. Tell me 

Her: literally every single person went up to Gary separately to ask if I was okay. Why didn’t you? 

Me: He literally told me you were tired and went to sleep. So you stormed up there and wanted to me follow you and give you attention. I’ll keep that in mind but you do that every time. You are the one who always ends up mad or crying 

Her: No I didn’t want anyone to follow me up there. I wanted everyone to leave and go home. I was genuinely upset and really sad. I promise you the last thing I was thinking about how to get attention from you. I’m not doing any of this to get attention from you, but the fact you never asked about me does hurt me a bit. I just want my feelings to be heard now but I can’t do that with you calling me crazy and throwing things in my face. I think I’m done with this conversation now as it’s going no where so please text me when you’re actually ready to talk instead of argue.

After this. I stopped texting her back because I was done at that point. So we went silent for a couple days until my birthday in which she just texted “happy bday” I said “thank you”. We didn’t text, we kept our Snapchat steak for a while sending blank snaps but I got sick of that so I ended our streak. 

Flash forward to December. She texted me and our text thread looks like this 

Her: Hey. We haven’t spoken or heard from each other in like 2 months now. I thought I should reach out before more time has passed and see where you think we stand. It all felt very sudden for a 15 year friendship so I was just wondering where you are with things.

Me: Hi. I’m not really sure what to say. I have tried to be the bestest friend I can for you. I have taken you on trips, I have spent thousands of dollars on you, I would do anything you ask but I’m not sure what more you want from me. I’m sorry for whatever you’re going through and your birthday wasn’t as extravagant as you wanted it to be but it was for my birthday too and I have no ill feelings towards anyone. There was no reason to lash out the way you did. I mean this with respect, I’m not trying to argue.

Her: I don’t think I can make people understand what exactly I was feeling on my birthday or what upset me, but I promise extravagance didn’t have anything to do with it. I have never considered myself to be ungrateful for your friendship and I am not currently going through anything. My intentions when saying I was taking a step back from the group didn’t mean everyone in the group individually but the group as a whole. So when you broke our snap  streak, I kinda took it as a message that you were done with our friendship. I know that our streak meant a lot. So I guess I’m wondering if I took that correctly or if I was wrong.

Me: I still don’t know exactly what you were upset about so if you want to elaborate. I don’t think a snap streak should be defined as friendship. I think we are a bit too old for that. I’m sorry you feel that way but I wasn’t going to keep sending and receiving blank snaps. 

Her: I remember you once telling me years ago that if our streak ended, we could no longer be friends, so I guess that was still in my head and what led me to that conclusion. I agree that we are too old for that though. I don’t think trying to explain that night will help anything to be honest. I think we both have set versions of events in our heads that we won’t get each other to see. I think we will have to decide if we want to agree to move on from there. I guess my main question is where you are with that right now?

Me: I don’t know what your question means. I can’t really answer it if I don’t know why you acted the way you did. I can admit that I got sassy with you when that all happened but I also started my period that day. So I apologize for that but I don’t think I did anything wrong so if you could elaborate, it would make me understand better. 

Her: Okay, I will try to explain. I just do not want to escalate or argue anymore. I feel like I put in a lot of work to try to keep the friend group together and keep us hanging out. I’m not saying everyone else isn’t, I just feel I do the majority most of the time. So when we finally all get to hang out, I’m always so excited. And I don’t want anyone to think it was because no one wanted to drink. If they didn’t, that’s completely fine, and I would never get upset at that. It was confusing though when you and Kole brought over like 50 jello shots and 12 blood bags and Dana brought like 2 cases of seltzers so I got the impression it was everyone would be drinking. I know Dana talked to me beforehand and said she would. But like I said that really didn’t upset me, It just confused me a bit. I really don’t mind if people didn’t want to drink. I probably should have asked but halfway through the game we were all playing, it felt like everyone just emotionally checked out from the entire night. You stopped talking and went super quiet, then it felt like Kole did. Then after the game, Dana just faced away on the floor and started going on TikTok and no one was really talking at all. I even suggested multiple times to play a game and brian was the only one who responded to me so I gave up. So that was kinda where I got upset. I felt like the night was going to be over 2 hours after it started and I was really sad about that. I am sorry that I went upstairs and did not come back down, I probably should have addressed what was going on and asked why absolutely no one was talking. It just feels like this stuff happens a lot when the group hangs out and no one actually has a good time anymore. One by one people emotionally just check out and it ends with no one talking for a bit and everyone on their phones and an awkward goodbye. So I was frustrated. That is why I typed in the group chat that  I did not want to participate in Secret Santa or White Elephant anymore. It was never my intention to cause all this angst and tension. I just wanted to take a step back and have someone else take over for a bit because it was starting to wear me down. And that night is something I got over in like a week, but the responses I got when I tried to explain myself were what really hurt me and caused all the silence on my part. It felt like everything I was saying and trying to explain was being turned back around on me. I felt like everyone thought I was blaming specifically them when I was just trying to share it. I know I was not the most gentle in that text exchange either and I am sorry for that too. I was just taken aback by how fast things escalated into arguing. I am not trying to make you feel bad or cause you to need to defend yourself. I’m not even sure you will understand it since you haven’t been looking through my eyes, but it seems really important to you that I try. I was not in the right to go upstairs and isolate myself from the group instead of confronting everyone, but I was also just really sad and had a few drinks in me at the time and felt like it was a hopeless situation. I do want to make it clear though that I am 100% not angry at anyone for not drinking or not wanting to. I loved all of your gifts and was extremely grateful for them as well, I didn’t need anything more extravagant. I just wanted to feel close to everyone again for a night and hid when it felt like the night reached the point of no return. My favorite night for us as a group was last Christmas when we just sat around drinking and playing games like Uno and Throw Throw Burrito and just talking to each other. I don’t know how much everyone even drank that night nor do I care. What I cared most about was that we all had fun together for a whole night instead of a few hours. Now it feels like I am just babbling on and on so this is the best I can do to describe my feelings. 

Me: You can’t let one night of tiredness, full stomachs and just not being in the mood as an example of it’s not like it used to be. As for everyone not talking and doing their own thing- we were all still content. It’s okay to just sit there and enjoy just being with each other despite not having the energy to drink, talk, etc. I don’t think this happens every time like you’re saying it does. But I hear your feelings and I understand why you thought that. 

Her: Yeah, I think we just have different interpretations of that night. I don’t stand behind my decision to isolate myself and not ask what was going on, but I don’t regret trying to tell everyone my feelings after the fact. I didn’t really expect it to escalate like it did though. At the time I was just trying to explain the best I could but everything kinda spiraled with us after that.

Then I didn’t respond for like 8 hours so she texted me again 

Her: hey, so you said you couldn’t answer my question if I couldn’t explain what I was feeling and what happened, and I did the best I could to do that. And I know it was a really large text so I gave you time to process. So now I’m just wondering where you are at in terms of the future for our friendship.

Me: As I said before I had no problems with anyone during or after that night. I didn’t like how it was handled by you taking a “step back”cancelling Christmas plans rather than just saying something in the moment. It made things weird for everyone because cancelling Christmas plans seemed like you wanted no communication at all. I did not want to keep sending blank snaps so that’s why I stopped our steak. I never had any intention to stop being friends with you but I was leaving it up to you to figure out what you wanted since you’re the one who wanted to distance yourself and I wasn’t going to force my friendship when it seemed like you didn’t want it

Her: I never had intentions of just stopping any of the friendships. I was taking a step back from the group, not everyone individually. All I wanted was some time to think about things. I didn’t mean just to stop everything. I sent you blank snaps after not out of malice or pettiness but because I was still upset from that night. Not particularly upset at anyone in general, just the whole thing. I did, however, go silent after our argument though because it took me by surprise and I had no clue how to approach the situation anymore. I just would like to know now that we have both said our explanations for what happened if we are going to be able to move on from this. I am completely fine with Brian as far as I know and I can always talk to kole about it too. I am going to talk with Dana about my feelings that night as well so I can clear things up because I feel like she has misconceptions as well.

Me: I don’t have a problem moving past it, like I said my interpretation was that you wanted to keep your distance till you were ready so I wasn’t going to reach out. I’ve been over it pretty much from the beginning because I didn’t see an issue with that night but that may be something we never agree on but that wouldn’t mean the end of our friendship lol 

Her: Yeah agree to disagree on that one. I am also fine with just moving past it. I just felt a lot of uncertainty about what you were feeling towards me and the future and everything like that.

Next day: Do you and Kole want to come over sometime for like a movie night sometime to just shake off whatever leftover weirdness there is

Me: Yeah we can do that

Her: I’m free Friday and Saturday nights

Me: Maybe the January 3rd or 4th but  kole might work 

+ plus a little small talk about exchanging Christmas gifts 

Neither of us followed up about movie night/ Christmas exchange and we haven’t really talked since except on New Year’s Eve when Dana invited both of us to a bar even though they argued real bad (way worse that her and I’s text conversation) about the events of that night with Dana. 

Dana and I have kept in touch and feel like Paige is crazy and crashed out since that night. Paige and Dana went out for coffee after Paige invited her to “talk about her feelings” and they ended it decent a few weeks after all this happened. But Paige has not tried to get coffee or anything with me and I’m just so confused what I did wrong and why she’s up Dana’s ass when they argued way worse! Paige is always texting Dana and wanting to hang out when Dana is in town. Dana has invited Paige to a couple things with her other friends and Dana said that Paige was horrible and mean to Dana’s friends, but played it off as joking. Dana is friendly with Paige but this whole thing brought me and Dana closer because we are still so confused what’s wrong with Paige. 

When me, Kole, paige, Gary, and Dana all showed up after Dana invited us for New Year’s Eve- it was awkward but it wasn’t like bad bad. We all talked a bit but there was a lot of weirdness still. 

Since then, I have only sent Paige a couple random texts every few weeks about random things and she is pretty dry. So like am I the asshole? I know I probably missed a few details but like what did I do wrong? At this point in time, I can’t see myself ever being friends with her again with how she acted, yet still talks to Dana.

For the past 3 years, every time I have gotten my physical, I get warning messages after I get my blood drawn that my LDL levels came back super high. It went from 139, 141, 147. Everything else is fine and ""perfect"" according to doctor standards *but* this. My doctor sent me a message in my chart accusing me of eating fried foods and pastries and says I need to lay off of the junk food, but I don't eat that kind of stuff ever. 

I drink nothing but tap or bottled water. No coffee, no tea, no juice, no carbonated/flavored water, etc. I work from home so I cook my own meals and I only know how to cook like 8 things total, so every day I eat the same thing which is a bowl of oatmeal and fruit for breakfast, chicken breast, sweet potato and cooked spinach for lunch and salmon, broccoli with cheese and more spinach for dinner. I don't like desserts so all cookies, cake, chocolate, candy I haven't had since I was a teen. I don't eat processed food so haven't had chips, protein bars, or frozen dinners in over a decade. I do go out with my friends on the weekends and sometimes will have McDonald's or a greasy pizza but that is 1 meal/1 day out of the week, the other days I eat like I stated before. 

I am a former college athlete, so I work out 6 days a week, running a 10k 3x a week and the other days I'm in the gym strength training or playing racquetball with friends. I told my doctor all of this and she only replied that it was the McDonalds and Pizza on the weekend that is causing the levels to be so high and just told me to stop eating fast food all together and that will fix the problem. 

I'm not a doctor and while I respect and trust doctor's opinions/advice, I have a hard time believing that my high LDL levels are solely because I eat fast food one meal out of 21 meals a week and feel like my doctor is being somewhat dismissive because she's a Know-It-All and writes condescending notes in my medical chart whenever I do something she disagrees with. 

Is there something else that could be contributing this? I read high LDL levels lead to heart attacks, heart disease, strokes, etc so I am quite concerned but I feel like doctor is being somewhat dismissive.

Free of her brother for the rest of the morning, Sera hopped down the stairs in such high spirits that even her mother noticed her smile. The two made eye contact, her mother still standing at the door where Seth had dashed out of. Suki’s hand was still on the doorknob, like she was waiting for him to be back already, so she would open it the second she heard his voice or Seth’s signature pounding footsteps, for Sera’s older brother was always running, always running somewhere from somewhere else, and leaving them all behind. Her smile faltered for a brief second as she looked away, and at her mother’s face, vanishing all negative thoughts with that motion as her smile renewed as if it had never left. Suki looked at her in question. 

“Can you believe how idiotic he really is, mum?” she giggled, walking past Suki and into the kitchen. “I cannot understand for the life of me. I outright said, to his face, that I was turning eighteen soon. And he said nothing, did nothing. Just stayed mad at me like a true older brother.”

Suki tilted her chin. “Mad at you? Why was he mad at you this morning?”

Sera paused for a moment, recalling she had literally asked her fully adult brother to smuggle her alcohol from his bartender job. Shoving her mouth full of breadfruit, Sera waved her hand dismissively, shaking her head. She swallowed down hard. “That’s besides the point, mum. I’m saying that Seth truly has zero inclination that today is his birthday and mine. Isn’t that insane? Whatever has happened to our resident workaholic. It has all gone to his head.”

Suki let out a low, dry laugh. “No, dear. I’m afraid the title of resident workaholic was earned by your father years ago. Nothing Seth ever does will compete.”

Sera didn’t look at her mom as she spoke, “Well, you can’t be a resident workaholic if you’re not even a resident.” She had said it with such a humorless tone, that her statement had single-handedly plunged the entire atmosphere into a weary, uncomfortable silence. 

Suki sighed sadly, moving towards her daughter, already rehearsing the words in her head before she spoke them. “Sera, dear-”

Sera moved away from her towards the stairs, without so much as a glance back. “Sorry to pull a Seth-original, but if I don’t bolt right now, I too will be late. And I can’t be late to school today. I have a test that needs to be aced.” with that, she hopped up the stairs and was gone.

Suki was left in the quiet, empty kitchen with a floating, outstretched hand and no one to hold onto. 

Upstairs, Sera was taking out her silent rage in the way she rushed to get ready, doing everything with more force than required, almost knocking several things over and trying hard to not slam the bathroom door as she rushed in and out to fix her hair, brush her teeth, survey her appearance. Her morning routine seemed to go by much faster than usual and she was thankful for it, because then she could get out of this tight and heavy house as fast as possible and finally breathe the horrible, but free air of the streets on her way to school. 

Their father, San, had always been a sour topic around the house. Nobody spoke about him, not because he wasn’t there, but because he would never be, even though he wasn’t dead. You spoke about someone you missed fondly because you could imagine the next time you would see them and how much relief you would feel when you did, how much better things would be when the thing you’ve been wanting finally gets to you. And when someone is dead, you talk about them fondly as well, but because you’re grateful for the time you already had and will never get back, a sort of respect by memory. Well, how do you talk about someone that isn’t dead, but might as well be? Sera had no idea, other than with disdain and spite, if at all. Suki had other opinions, always having something to say in defense of her absent husband. A hard-working soldier, she said, who sent us all the fruit of his hard labour every month. San’s money was what was getting us by everyday. I wonder whether my mother didn’t know that soldiers registered with families always got a portion of their salary sent back home, a portion kept for that soldier himself, and another piece set aside to save. It was why, on the streets, you heard soldiers earned so much money, but when you have that money in your hands, sliced into three, it suddenly didn’t seem like such a lumpy sum anymore. San hadn’t sent us any money himself. The crown did. Suki had to know, but was probably in some sort of denial. Oh, but he sent us letters every month as well, Suki said once. Yes, Sera thought to herself. Letters that could be compared side by side to one another over a year and all the 12 would appear written in one sitting. In his letters, San only ever indicated concern over the same things. That Seth was going about his forced assessment studies as advised, and that Sera was not still trying to live her aimless, stupid pipe dream of becoming a girl-soldier, that her grades in school were as high as the scoresheet allowed. San had stopped mentioning when next he would visit them, stopped asking how they were getting by, stopped trying to keep up with events in the tiny town and all his childhood friends who lived there in his absence. He stopped caring. She had tried to do the same, in all her stubborn nature, and she had failed because she was just so angry. And she couldn’t understand for the life of her why no one else seemed to be. Her mother was in a permanent state of dazed gentleness, seeming more sad and lonely than anything else. Her brother, that otherworldly buffoon, went about his busy days in such a state of normalcy, like absolutely nothing was wrong, and nothing had changed. Seth stayed diligently on the path that San had carved for him and cemented him into, irrespective of all the times it was clear that particular path was far from what was best for him. But Seth didn’t seem to care, even in their father’s absence. So she was left alone, left behind, the only one who still harbored rage for him, who had yet to come to terms and accept her situation and everything that came with it. She was nothing like Seth, and if she was ever going to squeeze herself into the tight lines her father had drawn for her, it would most certainly not be in his absence. Now, spitefully, she would do whatever she wanted, regardless of who supported her. Which is why she’d only be going to school to write the one test, and then head off to the school sparring grounds with Will, who seemed to be the only person in the world who saw her for who she truly was and accepted her that way, even praised her so very often. She would train with him until his free period was over, then he’d hand her over to his friends, who’d take turns fighting her until school came to an end. Then she would come home, in her clean uniform, changed out of any dirty combat clothes, talk briefly about how great her classes were when her mother asked, then head upstairs after a large meal and absolutely collapse on the top bunk until late into the night, when Seth came home, and collapsed right after her. Then she’d rise, like a zombie and do all her day’s homework and more studying, all easy stuff she could afford to halfass pumped up on coffee, and still maintain her stellar grades so steadily, that no one would ask any questions. Once it was all done the best it could be, she’d head back into bed a good time before Seth got up for his own early morning studying, oblivious to it all. Then it was eat, sleep, repeat. Just not in that order. And nobody would suspect a thing, because the ease of living with people who fooled themselves through life was that they would see the things they wanted to see, believe whatever was easier. And Sera had become wonderful at showing her father what he wanted to see for years. She could easily do the same to anyone else. 

So with an unseen determination, Sera jogged downstairs, ready to leave, and lied to her mum again, before rushing out of the house to draw her own lines and carve her own paths, because she was done letting other people do it for her.",1,1744087264.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

1ju5dq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tools/comments/1ju5dq1/fastener_storage_time_aarc/,Fastener Storage Time aArc.,"Just a general note to whoever is listening. I have grown from youth,  where we had about 7 or 8 coffee cans full of every imaginable nut/bolt/screw/nail/washer God ever made in a jumbled up frenzy that as kids we dumped on the farm shop floor to find THE EXACT PIECE WE WERE LOOKING FOR!  This was a time when stove bolts were common, so as to give you an idea of reference. I can remember being ""in trouble "" for not getting them all put back in the can - nobody wanted a flat from from a rusty, bent 16 penny nail! 

I grew to my teens, and graduated to tiny boxes which held the thirty two 1/2"" nuts I bought for $0.89 or the 158  concrete nails I bought in a waxed brown paper bag which I might need for ""a project"" (I was trying to think ahead,  you know!). I was really feeling my oats,  and I revelled in it!

Young adulthood had me buying larger and color coded boxes!  Stackable,  coordinated, this was THE EPITOMY of 3/4"" wing nut heaven.  I had Fastenal by the (excuse the pun) literal nuts. Anybody with a fastener minded brain could see that MY FASTENERS could solve almost any fastening problem you could contrive.  I had PLASTIC BOXES GALORE! It was a FASTENER MASTERPIECE,  and every red blooded male who walked through my garage bowed in humble acknowledgement of the mastery of boxes and fasteners I was so obviously capable of.  

20 or so years after that, I tired of the ""thinking SOMEDAY I could use these"" aspect of this,  and I got to the point of drawing out each and every project into a detailed masterpiece, in an effort to buy the EXACT AMOUNT of fasteners (i.e., 49-1/2x8 lag bolts, 27-3/4x7 anchor bolts, 13-10 mm fine/reverse threaded castle nuts) so as to not NEED additional plastic boxes, and hold them insitu until possibly/improbably needed once more. I was a WARRIOR! No project felt the fine detail and sharpened pencil of a builder as fierce as I; all jobs were in fact the enemy - not to be trusted, and only to be conquered by requiring not a single return trip to the hardware emporium.  I was unmatched in my fastidious adherence to perfection, and my close friends (the only ones to be trusted with the full truth of the matter) marveled at the detailed eye bolt count.

Today,  I must confess. I have gone back to the old coffee can. I am smiling, and that counts for something. In fact,  almost everything. ",1,1744087075.0,Tools,0,0.67,False

1ju59py,https://www.reddit.com/r/Muppets/comments/1ju59py/the_brilliance_of_letters_to_santa_2008/,The brilliance of Letters to Santa (2008),"I’ve seen at least one person make an entire post dunking on this film, another post asking for more love for the film, while other users pretty reliably rank it at or near the bottom of the Muppets’ Christmas movies. I watched it for the first time about a month ago, and since then, have watched it again **three times**. I am going to break down what I feel make this movie an underappreciated gem, even if the narrative itself is nothing to write to Santa about.

1. The soundtrack – This is a short film with only four original songs, all composed by the man who gave us ""Rainbow Connection"", the great Paul Williams. That being said, all four are bangers and instantly hooked me right from the start. The opening number at the post office is a cinematic marvel with the guy from Rent. Enough said. “It’s All About Heart” is a (no pun intended) heartwarming sequence in which Gonzo steps up as the (no pun intended) bleeding heart of the squad and inspires Kermit, Fozzie, and cohorts to not give up hope. “I Wish I Could be Santa Claus” is going to be its own paragraph, so stay tuned. And “My Best Christmas Yet” is such a banger, I’m constantly humming it, the melodies are so catchy and infectious. Plus Robin is adorable for his 30 seconds of screentime. A lot of classic Muppet songs took me quite a few listens to really appreciate, including masterpieces like “Being Green” and “Never Before and Never Again.” Not the songs from Letters to Santa. Instant bangers, in my opinion.
2. The raw, unadulterated absurdist comedy – I know absurdism is one of the Muppets’ strong suits, but I cannot overstate its role in this film. I’m probably a bit biased, but featuring a **full blown Sopranos crossover scene** with Paulie Walnuts and Bobby Bacala doing business with Pepe made me literally jump out of my seat and call my fiancée. I am a diehard Sopranos fan and somehow didn’t know that this totally random-ass scene with tenuous, but ultimately weak ties to the actual plot of the film existed. And even though they’re both credited as “Mafia Guy,” the Swedish Chef can clearly be heard saying “Sorry, Paulie” when he brings him a Swedish, fish-covered pizza, much to Paulie’s dismay. Genius. Some other examples include Mayor Bloomberg’s hilarious exchange with Miss Piggy at the beginning, Uma Thurman convincing the Muppets to literally ride on the wing of a plane headed to the North Pole, and the Muppets deciding to skydive off the plan with no parachute EVEN THOUGH THE PLANE IS LANDING IN THE NORTH POLE. Beaker being an absolute horn dog and spending the whole movie off somewhere engaging in rated-R behaviors with Petra Němcová. Vernon Dursley showing up as Santa Claus. Pepe breaking out into opera singing. The madness, the chaos, the unhinged lunacy, I love it.
3. The Nathan Lane subplot with Bobo the Bear – I cannot possibly explain how hard this made me laugh. Nathan Lane as Officer Frank Meany, very clearly clowning on the trope of the one-dimensional villain who changes his ways in the spirit of Christmas. This is very plainly the joke and it works so well, especially with the unrivaled comedy chops of Nathan Lane. And his freaking hilarious dynamic with Bobo the Bear is just on another level. I’m generally a Bobo fan, no matter what the movie he’s in. But these two just killed me in this film. “Ding ding ding da-ding ding ding” The interrogation room (which used to be the coffee room!) bit. It’s all perfect. All of it.
4. “I Wish I Could Be Santa Claus” – It’s not often a Muppets song gets me this choked up. But pay close attention to the lyrics. It’s not just the obligatory Christmas spirit pick-me-up song. It is a raw, emotional expression of the love that Gonzo and Fozzie have for one another. A sincere and passionate celebration of their friendship. This is evident in Fozzie’s line, “I’d try to teach the kids to be a little more like you.” Don’t get me wrong, I love Kermit with all of my heart, but I do believe that, more often than we realize, Gonzo and Fozzie are the heart and soul of the Muppets. This song hit me in ways and in places I couldn’t possibly have anticipated. It’s a short little ditty that is mostly about the Christmas spirit. But the extra, added focus on Gonzo and Fozzie’s friendship made it extra special because it let me know that they appreciate each other as much as I appreciate them. I sleep better knowing that it’s not just me so deeply affected by these wonderful young men, but that they feel it for each other, as well.
5. The fact that the entire sequence of the events in the film took place because of Gonzo’s dedication to making the children of the world happy during the Christmas season. The Muppets’ whole journey was kickstarted by Gonzo realizing he accidentally failed to drop off the letter to Santa from the little girl next door. He couldn’t live with himself knowing that he let her down, even though there’s no guarantee she would ever actually find out. This is admittedly a silly premise, but the sentiment is wholesome and genuinely heartwarming if you ask me. Gonzo is such a great guy and I love him forever.

This is a short 45-minute banger of a film that absolutely deserves more love than it gets. It’s a simple story with a lot of heart (pun intended) and way more comedy than any movie of its length has any business showcasing. If you skipped this one, maybe it’s time to fire up Disney+ and give it a go!",4,1744086652.0,Muppets,0,1.0,False

I’m most worried about the anesthesia. I’m getting my procedure through Kaiser if that matters. I’ve expressed my concerns to my surgeon and she thinks I’ll be fine. I just found out that I will not have an Anesthesiologist but a Nurse Anesthetist for my procedure which has heightened my anxiety to the point that I am thinking I need to cancel last minute. 

I have a history of really bad tachycardia that landed me in the ER multiple times and required a cardiac ablation to fix. That was 7 years ago. Now I’m mostly fine or at least that’s what my doctors who aren’t cardiologists say. No heart meds anymore but I still get the occasional skipped heartbeat and fast heart rate. I’ve completely cut coffee from my diet since my body can’t handle any caffeine. I was on a heart monitor recently and it seemed odd to me since I wasn’t working out but had a high of 180 but my doctors assured me it’s normal.

Anyway, I’ve had a lot of anxiety about going under. I wanted to talk to an anesthesiologist prior to my surgery to make sure I was safe for surgery and now I don’t know what to do since I have a CRNA assigned instead.

Adaptogens are non-toxic plants that, when consumed, can improve the body’s ability to cope with stress. They have been used in traditional medicine for centuries, particularly in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine. The term ""adaptogen"" refers to a natural substance that enhances the body's resilience to stress and helps stabilize physiological processes.

Understanding the science behind adaptogens and stress relief requires diving into how they function within our bodies. When you encounter stress, your body goes through a series of physiological changes, often referred to as the stress response. This involves the release of hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. While these hormones are essential for survival, chronic stress can lead to negative health effects, such as anxiety, depression, and other stress-related disorders.

Adaptogens work by modulating the body’s response to stress. They help balance the production of stress hormones and support the adrenal glands in their function. This means that rather than completely blocking stress, adaptogens help you manage it more effectively. This unique capability is what distinguishes adaptogens from other herbal remedies.

Some popular adaptogens include:

- **Rhodiola Rosea:** This herb helps enhance energy levels and combat fatigue, making it useful during long periods of stress.
- **Holy Basil:** Often used to promote mental clarity and emotional stability, holy basil also supports immune function.
- **Ginseng:** Traditionally used for its energizing properties, ginseng can help combat stress-induced fatigue.
- **Eleuthero:** Known for its ability to enhance stamina and endurance, eleuthero supports overall stress adaptation.

These adaptogens into your daily routine can provide significant benefits. Research has demonstrated their potential to:

- Reduce cortisol levels, promoting a calmer state of mind.
- Enhance mental focus and cognitive function under stress.
- Boost energy levels, helping to combat fatigue often associated with prolonged stress.
- Support emotional balance, reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms.

While adaptogens can be beneficial, it's essential to consider factors such as dosage and potential interactions with medications. Starting with a low dose and observing how your body reacts is crucial. It’s always advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before introducing new supplements, especially if you have pre-existing conditions or are on medication.

Adaptogens into your lifestyle can be done in various ways. They can be found in supplement forms like capsules or powders, or you can opt for herbal teas that feature these adaptogenic plants. Adding adaptogenic herbs to your smoothies, soups, or cooking can also make for delicious and healthful choices.

Beyond dietary changes, managing stress effectively often involves a holistic approach. Combine adaptogens with other stress-relief techniques, such as:

I am looking for technical answers, not emotional ones.

Now before people come for me and tell me to man up an be a real Aussie and drink cows milk, I gotta say I can't. I'm East Asian in genetics so I can't drink that sh, I can however drink super heated cows milk like they do in Asia.

  
But in Australia I just gotta find alternates. For the longest time I just drank black tea like a sad wanker. Then I went onto drinking oat w my coffee, but we all know that's a joke to drink on its own. But I went on a trip to Vietnam last month and tasted the sweetest most delicious Vinamilk Soy Drink and brought home a 4 pack and finished it in like 2 days. And I figured I'd be able to find alternatives considering the MELTING PAWT we are, but all I got is all this crap in Woolworths like BONSOY (bonsoy is for coffee only, it is not for drinking straight) and YEO'S disgusting bean juice.

  
My lovely mum even got me some ""DAMEE fresh soy milk"" with this koala on the front from Eastwood because bless her heart she cares about me (and I had a massive sook to her about how Asian food is so much better than Western food why did you ever leave), but it tastes like straight poop i'm so sorry. Like I'll finish this because she got this for me, but I'm wondering is there any soy bean drink around here that actually tastes good?

Now before you come for me and say ""well that sh in Vietnam has SO Much sugar in it you're a stooge"" yeah well that's what I want actually, I care about my tastebuds, not my health. (also why can't I find any drinks brand in Asian groceries aside from YEO's wtf it's giving monopoly and bottleneck.)",27,1744086101.0,AskAnAustralian,97,0.74,False
