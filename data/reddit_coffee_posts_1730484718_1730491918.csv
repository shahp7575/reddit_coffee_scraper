1ghensg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeleineMcCannInfo/comments/1ghensg/kate_and_gerry_mccanns_frequent_runs_and_kates/,"Kate and Gerry McCann's frequent runs, and Kate's knowledge of Praia da Luz.","Kate and Gerry McCann are known for their love of sport and would often go on runs together, it was the same when they stayed in Praia da Luz in 2007.

It is often repeated that the McCanns were unaware of their surroundings in Praia da Luz as they were only tourists but further investigation proves this wrong.

In her book 'Madeleine' Kate mentions their love of sport, specifically running.

*""Gerry was good at sport, too, and being Gerry he was hugely competitive. Middle-distance running was his forte and at seventeen he was the fastest in Scotland in his age group over 800 metres. At Glasgow University he ran with the Hares and Hounds club, whose team strip was a hideous bright yellow.""*

*""In our spare time Gerry and I would go out for meals with friends or run in the fields around Queniborough. Gerry played the occasional game of squash and joined Rothley Park Golf Club.""*

The McCanns' holiday in Praia da Luz:

As written by Kate McCann:

""Most afternoons the children went back to their clubs, while we played tennis, **went for a run** or read and chatted by the pool.""\*

""While our three were having fun elsewhere with their buddies, there would be a rare chance for Gerry and me to spend time together playing tennis, **going for a run** or just relaxing.""

Sunday 29 April 2007: ""In the afternoon the children went back to their clubs and, after a leisurely hour by the pool with Fiona, David and Dianne, **Gerry and I took a run along the beach.** Being able to play tennis and run together for the first time in ages was a real treat.""

2 May 2007: ""Today it rained. The children went to their clubs, but our tennis lessons were postponed. Instead we joined Fiona, David and Dianne at the Millennium restaurant for coffee. We then returned to our apartment and a little while later **I left again, to go for a run with Matt**. I’d bought a new pair of running shoes a few days before we’d left for Portugal and they were certainly getting a good initiation.""

3 May 2007: ""Having arranged for Gerry to meet the children, **I opted to go for a run** along the beach, where I spotted the rest of our holiday group. \[...\] **I had finished my run by five-thirty** at the Tapas area, where I found Madeleine and the twins already having their tea with Gerry.""

Matt Oldfield's witness statement: ""**I went running with Kate at lunchtime, she's quite a good runner,** and we went out on the road all the way up to the main junc, erm, the sort of main road where you access Praia da Luz from and then back'. Police officer: 'What sort of distance would that be?' 'Erm, yeah, I think it'd be about **three or four miles, maybe each way**'. Police officer: 'And you run, do you often run?' Matt's reply: 'Erm, no, I don't like it, but I quite like it on holiday when it's a bit warmer and it's not so bad on your joints and I quite like running on the beach, \[...\] she's quite a good runner and I quite enjoy it every now and again, but, if it's sort of unusual and you're sort of **exploring** a bit'. \[...\] I think **Kate might have run most days**, because she was quite a keen runner, and it may just be that either I thought I'd go for a run and she was already changed, or I was changed and, or Gerry might have said that, erm, I'm speculating, it may just have been coincidence that we both got into running gear and then decided to run together'. Police officer: 'But you went on this route and are saying you found it quite hard to keep up.' Matt: 'Yeah, well, yeah, she's quite a good runner'.

The route Matt goes on to describe is far beyond the borders of the Ocean Club resort.

Fiona Payne's witness statement: ""And then it was time to pick up the kids, so Kate and I walked from the Tapas area over to the main reception, going between, you know, there was a sort of **path that went between** the other Ocean Club complex as well along the road, erm, and she picked up Madeleine and I picked up Scarlet and then we walked back together and that was the only day we ever did, ever did that.""

Kate's witness statement: ""Both of them took Madeleine to the other creche. They went via a path in front of the small reception and then through gardens and stairs, **taking a short cut**. This route was the one mentioned by Gerry.""

Kate's book: ""After preparing some lunch, I went with Fiona to pick up Madeleine and Scarlett, who was in the adjoining Baby Club, taking her on the **quicker route** through the grounds of the Ocean Club, **which she \[Fiona\] hadn’t yet discovered**.""

So Kate knew her way around the village considering she already figured out the short cuts after a few days in Luz.

**So after six days of running around and exploring Praia da Luz, it safe to say that the McCanns knew their way around the village.**

Even after Maddie was reported missing the McCanns went on runs around the village of Luz.

*""I also felt a compulsion to run up to the top of the Rocha Negra. Somehow, inflicting physical pain on myself seemed to be the only possible way of escaping my internal pain.""*

*""Monday 14 May. Today I went for my first run since Madeleine was taken. Anyone who doesn’t run or exercise generally might wonder why, and more to the point, how I could possibly do this in the circumstances. Why is easy. Exercise, and running in particular, is good for the mind as well as the body. It can induce a sense of well-being, lifting your mood, and aids the relief of stress, anxiety and sleeplessness. \[...\] However, I was also driven by additional and more complicated motives. One was that somehow I knew running would help numb the torment, albeit temporarily. \[...\] I remember speeding along the beach, concentrating totally on Madeleine. I had a picture of her in my hand which I would squeeze when I felt tired to spur me on, especially going up the sharply rising Rua da Praia. I could not have entertained stopping. Simultaneously I was saying a decade of the rosary in my head. When I returned to the apartment block, I sat on the steps at the bottom and cried like a baby. Either the run or the crying, or both, seemed to induce a sense of calm. That first weekend I’d felt a burning desire to run up the Rocha Negra, and Gerry and I would in fact do so many times over the next few months.""*

16 May 2007: *""Gerry played tennis with Seddo, David and the Mark Warner tennis coach. \[...\] Although I’d been for a run two days before, to me, as I’ve said, this seemed a necessity rather than a pleasure, and there is no doubt there was an element of self-punishment to it. All recreational activities seemed inappropriate, verging on disrespectful, and because they weren’t yet right for me, I found it hard to understand how Gerry could enjoy them,""*

Gerry's blog posts also mention running:

20 May 2007: *""Kate is a keen runner and in the last few days has tried to include a run in the daily routine. Yesterday (Sat) at 7am we ran to the monument at the top of the steep cliff overlooking Praia de Luz. We reached it in 19 minutes.""*

27 May 2007: *""Strange day after all the activity during the week. Kate and I started off with an early morning run to the the top of the nearby cliffs.""*

17 June 2007: *""Kate and I managed an early morning run before church.""*

Still to this day Kate and Gerry go on runs together and compete in marathons and triathlons.

So, it's very possible that after six days of running around and exploring Praia da Luz, the McCanns knew their way around the village.",1,1730491812.0,MadeleineMcCannInfo,0,1.0,False

No, not that type of grounded. 

However, being “Grounded” comes with many different connotations. 

Some good, some not so good. 

Today, we are talking about the good version of “You’re Grounded”, Heavy Duty Braided [Ground Straps](https://falconerelectronics.com/ground-straps/). 

However, let’s take a step back to your teenage years for a moment. 

When you first heard “You’re Grounded” in your teenage years, you knew that pain and suffering were on the horizon. 

How? 

Loss of phone privileges, no weekends with your friends, no dates, and possibly even worse. 

Most likely you found yourself stuck at home.

The sad truth, we all probably deserved it. 

However, let’s change gears. 

Thankfully the conversation today goes in a totally different direction. 

**Related Article:** [**You Will Find Ground Straps in Planes, Trains and Automobiles**](https://falconerelectronics.com/you-will-find-ground-straps-in-planes-trains-and-automobiles/)

# Grounded with Braided Ground Straps 

“You’re Grounded” for this conversation reflects safety and security. 

Heavy Duty Ground Straps help you stay grounded in the sense of avoiding electrical currents. 

Yes, those shocking electrical currents that just do not feel so good. 

Ground Straps help protect you and those loved ones around you.  

[**Check out the Instant Ground Strap QuoteBuilder** ](https://falconerelectronics.com/instant-ground-strap-quote/)

For example, ground straps protect your spouse or significant other, friends, family, priest, the in-laws, UPS driver, your pet parakeet, drive-thru window companion that you see every day at the coffee shop as well as anyone else that you encounter on a regular basis.  

Sorry if we left anyone out. 

Anyway, with any electrical device, a ground strap provides a designated and safe path for electrical energy to flow to ground without harm.

By providing a path to ground, electricity can travel safely, minimizing injuries as well as potentially save lives.

Who knew that such an inexpensive product like a small ground strap could provide such value to its users. 

In conclusion, next time you hear the words “You’re Grounded”, you are not in trouble at all. 

It simply means you are safe and sound.

So I chose phantom Noir as my Sotd and thought I'd give a short review. 

The notes on the bottle almost perfectly describe what I smell but not in the order listed haha.

I feel like it's chocolate forward then a mix of coffee and caramel comes through. I also get almond coming through a bit to add a bit of creaminess. 

It's basically like a cup of hot chocolate 50/50 mixed with a caramel flavored coffee and then you add some almond milk cause you're trying to be healthy and not use full on creamer. 

Also it's not really sweet as expected, like the cup above is not using any sugar. There's other notes listed but I don't get them. 

I'd say it's an unisex frag for sure perfect for a chilly fall day.

The weekend after I asked her she said she was busy because it was her birthday weekend, okay, fair enough. She asked me if the following week would work (this week), and I told her I worked a lot but if I could swing something I’d let her know. 

On Monday, I asked her if she was free this Friday (today) and she said no, that she’s going to a symphony with her fam. Cool, again just timing. But I let her know pretty quick after that I was free some other days this week and to let me know if they line up, but she never got back to me. So I waited 2 days and heard nothing over text so I just texted again and said “hey I don’t mean to bug you about this and I apologize if it’s coming off that way, but I’d like to know what the plan is so I can plan around it.” And she got back to me immediately very apologetically and said “she sucks at texting” and that she’s busy with work, church and family all the times I suggested and asked if she could let me know about next week, apologizing again. I said yeah that’s fine, that I’m pretty open next week and just to let me know. 

It’s been two days since then and that’s not very long so I’m just trying to be patient. I haven’t talked about the plans much in person, but when I have she seems to be down, but she really doesn’t text me at all. I admittedly have been lead on a few times before so I think I might be a little too weary of that, but I also feel like if she really wanted to go out she’d be more active in helping with the planning. I don’t want to be overbearing, so I plan on not mentioning anything about the date next week to give her a chance to reach out and let me know like she said she would.

I’m very worried that she’s not actually wanting to go out and that she’s just trying to make excuses to not go out with me as to not hurt my feelings. But at the same time I feel like that’s sort of irrational because she has expressed multiple times that she is down to go out and has clearly asked about later times. I just feel so conflicted because I’m eager to go out but I don’t want to seem desperate or needy, but I want to know that she’s not just going to keep putting the date off until later. “If she wanted to, she would” keeps replaying in my head. I think I need to let go and just see what happens and stop thinking so much about it for the next week.

($50ish)","Hello all!  I hope this is okay to post here, and apologies if not. I am in Northern California looking for where to find where to buy a mug that meets specific criteria.

I have a coffee/Espresso lover in my life who never asks for anything. And the one time that they actually have asked for something, I am having trouble finding it.  They have expressed wanting a nice wide latte mug.  (Cool, no problem!) Then they added that it would be cool for it to have a quote on the inside of the mug (DONE, or so I thought.)  The issue I'm having is that I simply can't find this mug. Is a mug like this something others have come by and could you direct me in that direction? I have googled and checked etsy, etc. I have come across a mug or two, but nothing that is quite it.  Any suggestions or leads are welcomed! Like I mentioned earlier, my coffee lover never asks for anything and I have made it my life's mission to find the perfect latte mug for them. Or at least try for a while before I end up at least just getting  a nice one with no quote.  I don't want to break the bank, but it is something I am willing to save for in order to get for them. Thank you !",3,1730490858.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1ghe8aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/MythosIndustries/comments/1ghe8aq/illyria_24/,Illyria 24,"I sit down on the patio with my iced coffee. Holden recovered and returned home under his own power a couple days ago. I told him everything that went down after he got shot. It blew his mind that Artemis came down and saved him. After being shot, it didn’t slow him down. He got dressed and supervised The Pack taking the bikes left by the Lobos. He is planning on stripping them down for parts. I’m told that it was Shine’s idea. The Pack are unusual for werewolves. I just can’t explain it. I think I believe that because of Grave. She is quiet but intense. Very intense. I doubt she has to take the alpha form to do real damage. She is the most intense individual I’ve ever met and she says nothing. It’s like The Pack are the island of misfit toys on wheels. I sit here and think about the fact I almost lost my friend…again. Just two days ago. It’s really fucking me up right now. The door to the guesthouse opens and Holden walks out. Without thinking, I get up and run to him. Then I give him a big hug.
“The hell?” Holden says.

“Hug me back, asshole.” 

Holden wraps his arms around me. I try but I end up sniffing with a tear rolling down my face.

“We aren’t going to talk about our feelings are we?” Holden asks.

“Shut up. I almost lost you.”

“I could get hit by a bus today or any other day actually”

“Not the same. That’s an accident. What happened the other day was very much on purpose.”

“What happened the other day could’ve happened with any other normal pack.”

I lean back and look up at him.
“How are you so casual about this?”

“I got people that depend on me. The kids and my chapter. Plus you. I fall apart, y’all fall apart.”

“You need to process what happened.” I say.

“I will. In my own way and in my own time. When I feel it’s right. Can you watch the kids? I got a meeting with Mercy.”

“Right now?” I ask.

“Yup. Then I’m going to hunt down the Lobos. I’ve already made some calls to other Prezs. The Pack are on high alert. The Pack is already searching the tristate area.”

“Ok. I can watch the kids. You do you.”

“You know I will. Thanks.” Holden says. He gives me a tight squeeze before walking away.

I wipe away a second tear as I hear Holden’s motorcycle start and drive away. I go into the guesthouse and find Lilith and Fang sleeping in Holden’s bed. After what happened, they don’t let Holden out of their sight. They are going to be mad that he left without them. I sit down in the bed and gently shake Lilith.
“Hey. Wake up.”

Lilith wakes and when she sees that Holden is gone. She panics. I grab her shoulders and say.
“Calm down. He’s fine. He had business to take care of.”

She knocks my hands away and tries to get up but I grab her and thrown her back down on the bed.
“You want to dance? We can do that. I’m way stronger than I look. We need to talk, understand?”

Lilith bares her teeth and growls.

“Save it, bitch.” I say as I lean over and shake Fang. “Wake up, dude.”

Fang wakes up and slightly panics.
“Easy dude. He’s fine. He’ll be back. Listen, I got something to say.”

Fang sits up.

“Ok. I know Holden has old you two to protect Aurora, Maddy and I. I’m saying protect him first.”

Lilith stops growling. I continue.
“Holden is more important. He’s your alpha and Prez of his club. Not only is he my best friend. He’s my oldest. So I’m saying protect Holden and Aurora and Maddy at all cost. Even at the expense of me. Understand?”

Lilith stays silent. Fang nods his head.

“Good. Glad we have this understanding. Now go use the bathroom and I’ll make some breakfast.”

I get up and they run past me to get outside. I go into the kitchen and start making some food. There wasn’t much but I was able to whip up some steak and eggs for the kids. I walk to the door and yell.
“Breakfast!”

“What’s cooking?”

I look over and see Aurora walking towards me with Scorn on her shoulder. She is holding an iced coffee.
“Kids breakfast. I see you found my coffee.”

“You mean my coffee.”

I smirk as Lilith and Fang run into the house. We all walk in and sit at the kitchen table. Fang smiles as Aurora sits next to him. Right before tearing into his steak. Seems he has no problem with cooked meat. Lilith struggles but she does start eating her steak. Seems she is still getting used to it.

“What’s on the agenda today?” Aurora asks.

I sigh.
“Well. Holden’s agenda is hunting down the Lobos. So we are in a holding pattern until it’s done.”

“How’s he holding up?”

I fold my arms and lean back.
“A little too stoic for my liking.”

“Because he didn’t break down and boohoo on your shoulder?”

“He didn’t even want to talk about it. He said he will deal with it on his own terms and time.”

“Seems sensible.” Aurora says.

“Seems toxic.”

Aurora shrugs.
“Who am I to judge? People call me toxic all the time.”

Then she drinks some of my iced coffee.

“That shit that went down a couple days again was a big deal. Could go sideways in the future if not dealt with properly.”

“His trauma, his choice. Oh.” Aurora says then stops talking and wipes some egg off of Fang’s face. “There you go my handsome guard.”

Fang smiles. A wolf, human hybrid smiling is a bit disturbing. But Fang’s charisma makes up for it. I look over and see some egg on Lilith’s face. I go to wipe it.
“How did you get egg next to your ear?”

Lilith smacks my hand away.  I reach again and she smacks it away again.
“Fine. Look like a fool. See if I care.”

“Little snippy with her. That because Holden isn’t dealing with something the way you would like?” Aurora asks.

I snort.
“Yeah, yeah, sure. Holden is always doing something I don’t like. If I took it personally, I would always be irritated.”

Aurora looks at me with a raised eyebrow.

“Shut up.”

Aurora takes another sip of my iced coffee.

The kids finish and start to get up. I snap my fingers repeatedly.
“Hey, hey. Dishes in the sink.”

Lilith gives me a death glare as she does as she is told. Fang puts his dish in the sink and stands next to Aurora. She puts a hand on his face.
“I don’t need anything, sweetheart. Go play with Lilith. Scorn, do you want to go play with them?”

Scorn screeches and lands on Fang’s shoulder. The three of them run outside. I get up and make a second iced coffee. I then sit back down and take a sip.

“Feeling better?” Aurora asks.

“As a matter of fact, I am.”

We both laugh. Maddy walks in the opened front door.
“What’s up?” I ask.

She walks in followed by Grave. As always her face is mostly covered by her long black hair. I wouldn’t think she would need sunglasses but she’s wearing them.
“There you are. You know where Holden is? Grave is looking for him.” Maddy asks.

“Went to talk with Mercy. Why?” I respond.

“We found them.” Grave says.

“Who?” Asks Aurora.

“Tock. He and the rest of his assholes were holed up in a shithole about fifty miles from here. Death is bringing them back.” Grave says in a soft voice.

“Shit. You don’t know where Mercy lives do you?” I ask.

Grave shakes her head no.

“Ok. I’ll go and tell Holden. Were you taking them?”

“Clubhouse.” Grave answers.

“Ok. He’s on his way. Maddy, can you watch the kids?”

“Sure can.”

Aurora stands.

“Where you going?” I ask.

“To the clubhouse. Those assholes could’ve shot us too. I want to see justice served.”

“Wait a min. Hold on.” I say. I take out my phone and dial. Holden’s phone goes off in the bedroom. I lean my head back.
“Fuck. He didn’t want to be disturbed. That’s why you came. You called already.” The last part I say to Grave. She nods her head yes.
“Alright. He will be there in a hour.” I say.

We leave the guesthouse. Aurora follows Grave and I head towards Mercy. When I get there, Cythina opens the door.
“What the hell do you want?”

“Holden. Where is he? His bike is out front.”

“Talking to mom.”

“Out of my way.” I say as I push my way in. I make a beeline to Mercy’s office. I don’t bother knocking. I just throw open the door.
“Dude. They found Tock.”

“Where?” Asks Holden.

“They all are being brought to the clubhouse. You would already know if you had your phone on you.”

Holden gets up as Mercy says.
“Take care of it. We’ll finish our talk later.”

Holden nods at her and leaves and I follow…to a point. Holden is hellbent and has little regard for safety and road rules. I end up being five minutes behind him. I reach the clubhouse unsure of protocol. So I just walk in. The first floor is filled and I do mean filled with The Pack members. Tock is in the middle and secured by chains.
“You killed my brothers and sisters. You’ll pay for this.” Tock sneers.

I go and stand with Aurora near the back.

“No. These are your final moments. The claw is mine and never meant for you.”

“This is bullshit. You don’t have the authority to kill the President of M.C.”

“I have the authority given to me by King. That’s all I need.” Holden says.

“That’s only one member of the original, that’s not enough.” Tock counters.

“Excuse me.” I say without thinking. Everyone turns and looks at me. I make my way to the front.
“I believe I’m the ultimate authority here.”

With blood poring from his mouth Tock sneers at me.
“This ought to be interesting. Why do you say that?”

I straighten my back to show my authority. Or at least fake it well.
“This whole state belongs to my mother, Faust. She has banned house vampires and satanists from this state. She has done this over a mountain of bodies. The Pack recognizes this and that’s why they came here to ask for her blessing to set up a chapter here. In her absence I have taken her place. It is my word that allowed The Pack and the Fangs to come here. My mom’s authority that I’ve used is backed up by the kingdom of Dusk and the fairy kingdom. My uncle is the god of serial killers so I’m including them as well.”
I lean towards Tock.
“You fucked with the wrong bitch and you’re about to find out.”
I straighten and look at Holden.
“You have the full blessing of Faust to kill this man. If anyone has a problem with it. They will face the combined forces of her allies.”

“You can’t do this!” Tock screams.

“I have spoken.” I say before I go back and join Aurora. She elbows me in the side and whispers.
“That was badass.”

“I’m on the verge of passing out.” I whisper back.

Holden starts undressing.
“You are the last member of the Lobos. Once you’re gone. The Lobos will be gone and forgotten.”

Tock snarls.
“Unite me and face me like an alpha.”

Holden tilts his head.
“That’s fair. However. Honor and our ways are a foreign concept to you. Instead of facing me before. You had a sniper try and take me out instead of you. So no. You will die like the spineless coward you are.”

Once naked, Holden transforms into his alpha form and howls. The alpha howl does something to the lizard part of our brains. I know I’m not alone in this because when he howls. Aurora grabs my arm in a death grip out of instinct. What happened next was surprising. Holden outstretches his arm and spreads out his claw. Then a metal claw gauntlet thingy materializes and covers Holden’s forearm. Then Holden puts the claw in front of Tock’s face. Then he swings and rips Tock’s throat out. Nearly decapitating him. The room explodes into howls and cheers. I feel a sense of relief wash over me. At that moment the sound of motorcycle engines could be heard. Everyone turns and looks as the door opens and King and a red handed woman walk in. King turns to her.
“See Executioner. That’s why we make a reservation. We missed the show.”

Executioner licks her lips.
“I’m more interested in dinner.”

We walks to Tock’s dead body. I can see on her cut the patch that says “Prez.”
“Fuck you Tock. This is what a spineless coward deserves.”

Then she turns to Holden and looks up.
“So you’re Holden. Nice to meet you. I’m Executioner, Prez of the Indiana chapter.”

Holden transforms back into human. The claw of Artemis disappears.
“Nice to meet you. King has told me a lot about you.”

“All good things, I’m sure. Holden, there may come a time where the New Moon chapter will need help. The Indiana chapter will be your go to. I think you will find us up for the task.”

I look and see M.C members walk in. Even by outlaw standards, they are a rough looking bunch. Some are even missing an eye. One chick is missing a whole ear. Executioner continues.
“I have to admit. I was disappointed that the Indiana chapter wasn’t selected for the claw. But looking at Tock’s dead body. I’m looking forward to whatever trouble we get into.”

“I think you may be over qualified for the job.” Holden says.

“We definitely are.” Executioner tells him.

You know how people say that everyone is a badass until a real badass walks into the room? That’s Executioner. She flat out radiates violence. Her whole chapter does honesty.

“With the Lobos dead. I say this is the perfect time for a party.” King exclaims. 

This is greeted by a roar from the crowd. Holden turns to Grave.
“Can you dispose of the body? No need to make it respectful.”

Grave nods and grabs a couple people to help her. Executioner looks around and sees Aurora and walks straight towards us.
“A fellow redhead. I thought I smelled another badass bitch in here.”

“Aurora. Nice to meet you.”

Executioner sniffs.
“You’re not werewolf.”

“I’m a witch.”

Executioner smiles and it is fucking terrifying. It feels like a predator before they attack. Executioner turns to me.
“Who are you?”

“I’m Illyria.”

Now Executioner smiles at me. Which I rather she didn’t.
“So you’re the one that allowed this. King has told me about you.”

“I am. Holden is a dear friend.”

Executioner looks at both me and Aurora.
“A werewolf, a witch and whatever you are. This should be fun.”

Then she walks away.

“I need a smoke.” Aurora says.

“I’ll join you.” I reply.

We go outside. Aurora lights a cigarette and I ask.
“Can I have one?”

She gives me one and lights it. I take a drag and exhale.

“That was intense.” Aurora says.

I bring my cigarette to my lips with a shaking hand.
“I’ve never ordered an execution before.”

“I guess you’re not in Kanas anymore.”

“I guess not.” I say.

“To be fair. You didn’t. You have your blessing.” Aurora tells me.

“Feels the same.” I respond.

Holden walks out.
“Hey, party is about to start. I’ve called Maddy and she is bringing the kids.”

“That wise?” I ask.

“Sure. More members of The Pack need to see them. Strengthen bonds.”

“You good?” Aurora asks Holden.

“Yeah. I’m fine. Better now that Tock is dead.”

“Why didn’t you say you had the claw this whole time? How does it work?” I ask.

“I got it the day I got my cut. I pit it in and …I dunno. I absorbed it. It’s always on me.”

“And you didn’t show it until now?” Aurora asks.

“The best weapon is the one your enemies don’t know about. I thought Tock wanted to see it before he died.”

I take a drag.

“Since when do you smoke?” Holden asks me.

“Don’t fuck with me today, Holden.” Is my reply.

“Kinda hot seeing daddy taking care of business.” Aurora teases.

Holden tilts his head back.
“Bitch, stop saying that. You going to say that around the wrong people and it’s going to be a thing.”

“It’s a thing as far as I’m concerned.” Aurora says before taking a drag.

“You need to be more concerned with Executioner. She seems quite taken with you. Holden tells Aurora.

“I’m not worried. I got daddy looking over me.” Aurora replies.

“You know what? I came out here to check on you two. You good. I got more important stuff to do. Stay for the party or leave. I don’t care.” Holden says before going back inside.

“That really bothers him, you know?” I say before taking a drag.

“Does it bother you?”

“As a life long friend. I approve of this ball busting.”

“Good. Mommy agrees.”

“You know what? That’s a bridge too far. I approve of busting Holden’s balls. Not mine.”

Aurora finishes her cigarette as do I.
“I’m going inside.”

“I’m staying out here for a minute. Can I have another cigarette?” I ask.

“Sure.” Aurora says. She hands me one and goes inside.

I stay outside thinking. Today was a lot. Jesus, I wonder if mom had situations like this. As I stand there, Death walks out.
“Not partying?” I ask him.

“I prefer the quiet.” He says softly.

I do t know Death well but he very much puts out a “don’t fuck with me and I won’t fuck with you” vibe. So I’m not going to fuck with him.
“Ok. We can enjoy the quiet together, quietly.”

Death nods.

I take a drag.

It’s nice to enjoy the quiet with a new friend.",1,1730490679.0,MythosIndustries,0,1.0,False

1ghe6r4,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmyjoystick/comments/1ghe6r4/pcunknown_a_first_person_flash_game_which_gets/,[PC][Unknown] A first person flash game which gets more & more creepy as the game proceeds.,"Platform(s): PC. I played it on a browser. 

Genre: horror or thriller. It was a first person game. Not shooter. Although i do remember shooting or killing happening towards the end of the game.

Estimated year of release: I played it between 2015-2018

Graphics/art style: Pixel art style. I think this style is called 8 bit graphics. To give a reference, pretty similar to the art style of the game '8bit Killer' 

Notable characters: I remember when we leave our house on the first day for office, we meet a neighbour, do a small talk, then go to office and meet our boss who give us work. The neighbour had a name. As the next days arrive, the game starts getting worse progressively. I think after two or three days when we leave our house for office, and the scene cuts to the neighbour as usual (for doing the usual small talk), we find him laying dead.

Notable gameplay mechanics:  gameplay included clicking and typing i think. And if i remember correctly typing was only included in one scene, where we are in the office and had to complete our office work by randomly pressing any key. We had a keyboard or typewritter in front of us with a sheet attached to it and as we pressed keys the sheet got filled. When it filled fully our office work was done.

Other details: the game starts by us waking up and opening eyes to see our house's roof which was brown in colour (our characters pov is what we see). We get up and make a cup of coffee and go for office. Scene cuts to us seeing our neighbour and talking with him, then go to our office and do work. Then on the next day we wake up again as usual and do the same routine but things get progressively weirder. i remember towards the end, we wake up with earthquakes, the roof start getting cracked, the coffee we make doesnt look like a coffee anymore, The neighbours talk gets strange, we even see him rotting i guess but go to work like we didnt see that and still had to countinue our normal routine like it was nothing.

I'm thinking of taking nicotine gums for a while after coffee. I'm already a light smoker like one cig a day after work. I was thinking I might as well take this opportunity to switch to gums and eventually quit. 

Am I thinking straight? Not here for confirmation bias.

# Do you often find yourself dragging through the day, waiting for the next cup of coffee to kick in? 

# You’re not alone! Many people struggle with energy levels, but the good news is that you can recharge your battery without relying solely on caffeine or energy drinks. In this post, we’ll explore five effective energy hacks that can help you feel revitalized, focused, and ready to tackle whatever comes your way!                                                          

# 1. Power Up with Proper Hydration Did you know that even mild dehydration can lead to fatigue and decreased concentration? Water is essential for every cell in your body, and it plays a crucial role in maintaining energy levels. 

# Aim to drink at least 8-10 cups of water daily, and don’t wait until you feel thirsty! Hack: Start your day with a glass of water first thing in the morning, and keep a water bottle handy throughout the day. You can even infuse your water with lemon, cucumber, or mint for a refreshing twist! 

# 2. Move Your Body When energy dips, a quick burst of physical activity can be incredibly effective. Exercise increases blood flow and releases endorphins, giving you a natural high that can last for hours.

#  Hack: Try a 5-minute movement break every hour. This can be as simple as a few stretches, a brisk walk around the block, or a quick dance session to your favorite song. You'll return to your tasks feeling more alert and energized! 

# 3. Optimize Your Sleep Environment Quality sleep is crucial for maintaining high energy levels during the day. If you’re tossing and turning at night, it’s time to revamp your sleep environment. 

# Hack: Create a relaxing bedtime routine by dimming the lights an hour before bed, keeping your bedroom cool, and minimizing noise. Invest in blackout curtains and consider using a white noise machine if you live in a noisy area. 

# Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night to wake up refreshed. 

# 4. Snack Smart What you eat plays a significant role in your energy levels. Instead of reaching for sugary snacks that lead to crashes, opt for nutrient-dense foods that provide sustained energy.

#  Hack: Create your own energy-boosting snack packs! Combine nuts, seeds, and dried fruits for a balanced mix of healthy fats, protein, and fiber. Consider including snacks like Greek yogurt with honey, apple slices with almond butter, or veggies with hummus to keep your energy stable throughout the day. 

# 5. Mindfulness and Breathing Exercises Stress can drain your energy faster than anything else. Incorporating mindfulness practices into your routine can help you manage stress and recharge your mental batteries. 

# Hack: Take 3-5 minutes each day to practice deep breathing or meditation. Find a quiet space, close your eyes, and focus on your breath. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a moment, then exhale slowly through your mouth. 

# This simple practice can reduce anxiety and boost your focus. 

# Conclusion: Take Control of Your Energy Energy management doesn’t have to be complicated. 

# By incorporating these simple hacks into your daily routine, you can experience a noticeable difference in your energy levels and overall well-being.

#  Remember, small changes can lead to significant results! What are your favorite energy hacks?

*Covers real life sensitive topics, feel free to skip post*

Well you guys asked for it, so here it is! This was originally written about 2 years ago. 

I'm the parent to a bunch of stuffed animals (all posts so far)

This series is ongoing but it's been confusing to some people who read the new posts and don't have all the context. So, I've decided to compile it all in one post! I tried to put things in order, so hopefully it will be. Also, some of these are from months ago.

Part 1

This is going to sound like the craziest thing ever, but I don't care. If you want to comment mean things, go right ahead. It's just more engagement on my post. 

Also, I'm not sure if I can post this in the parenting sibreddit since they're not human kids.

Anyway, here it is.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been buying stuffed animals, and I started taking care of them like my kids until they actually became my kids. They all have their own voices and personalities, and I love them all. 

I have no idea how this happened. It's just been happening and has been a part of my everyday life ever since I could remember. It probably happened as a mixed result from my autism and a stress response from my abusive dad.

But now this is my life, and I couldn't imagine it without my stuffed animal children! Anyway, this was just an introduction. I'll post more later.

I know not everyone is going to understand or be nice about it but I'm going to continue posting about my kids. Cheers.

This...this blew up. Please continue sharing your stories about your own stuffed animals! We're all in this together. And for all the comments, thank you so much. It makes me so happy to hear about your stuffed animals. Send me any info you want about them. I'm hanging out with my mom tonight (who is a human btw) but if I don't update by tomorrow I definitely will tomorrow! There's so much I want to share!

Part 2

I'm the parent to a bunch of stuffed animals. Just to be clear, the kids in this story are all dolls/stuffed animals.

Amyway, my daughter, Marceline, age 19, left home. She and her boyfriend have one son, Ash, and they were trying to have a second child. 

Marceline really wanted one. I didn't realize how much until the doctor told them they probably couldn't have another kid (her and her boyfriend). 

She and her boyfriend and son moved back home (they had been living away from home for a few different reasons) and fell into a deep depression and started smoking weed and making edibles, which my younger kids got into once.

I got angry and told Marceline she was no longer allowed to smoke weed or make edibles and as she was living under my house she would live by my rules. I told her I was sorry she couldn't have another baby but she needed to get it together. Tough love and all.

She then left (this was weeks ago) and has been gone ever since. She left us a note explaining she was going to stay at her friend, Jessica's and did not want to be bothered. She said she would have her phone off the entire time and that I was nobody's fault and she wasn't mad, she was just depressed and needed some time to figure some things out. She left her weed pipe beside her note.

We had a family meeting so everyone could voice their concerns. Some of the kids were concerned, some felt guilty, and some said that it was good that she was taking some time for herself because she clearly needed it. 

In the end we reluctantly decided to leave her alone. She was obviously depressed and maybe this would help.

Part 3

Kind of a spinoff but related post to my ""I'm a parent to a bunch of stuffed animals"" series.

These are just a few basic rules you should know if you're going to be reading about and/or a part of my stuffed animal world. The rules are different from ours in a lot of cases.

1. The legal age to learn to drive is 13.

2. Stuffed animals can date within their families.

3. Stuffed animal school is still closed because of you-know-what.

4. Sibling assignments are when an older sibling takes on a majority of the responsibility for a younger sibling. I'll go more into that later.

5. Not all stuffed animals are good.

6. The stuffed animal world exists within ours but is very different in a lot of regards. The one constant that keeps us connected is the human/stuffed animal (or doll) relationship.

7. Not all stuffed animals age every year.

Part 4

My daughter left home a while ago and disappeared. Nobody has seen her or heard from her since. She said shes staying with a friend and requested to be left alone so we did. 

Her 20th birthday recently passed and it makes me sad that she celebrated it without her family and especially her twin brother. He was very upset and missed his sister. He called her friend's house and she requested not to attempt to contact his sister again.

She needs time to figure some things out, apparently, and she doesn't want to hear from us right now. She's of legal age so there's nothing to be done. I'm worried about her.

Part 5

I've talked about this before. I post these stories here and a few other places but not on any parenting subreddits because I'm technically not a ""real"" parent. At least, the other parents would see it that way.

I know this is weird, but I'm the parent to a bunch of stuffed animals. One of my girls, a 4 year old named Kendall, has been getting sick 1-2 times a month since about November of last year. Is this just a phase or something? Did anyone else have a kid who got sick a lot but then got over it?

I'm kinda worried. Usually it's just a cold and she'll be better in 2-3 days but a couple times she had the stomach flu and most recently it was an earache.

Part 6

Good morning! This is another part in the ""I'm the parent to a bunch of stuffed animals"" series. Thank you to the person who stood up to me on the last post when one user said I wasn't a parent! 

Anyway, one of my stuffed animal kids, Rigby, I've had since 2017, as I brought him home as a foster kid. I started the adoption process after a month with his permission. The problem is, the adoption process to adopt a stuffed animal child usually takes years, and they wouldn't let me continue it when i moved back in with my mom due to covid, so it was stalled for two years.

We're going to get to move forward with it once I move out though. However it could still take up to a year to finish. They do have a new adoption process that's out that takes a much shorter time, but they're still letting people who already started using the previous adoption process continue with that. 

I dont want to stop the adoption process to start using the other one because my son has had terrible experiences with foster homes that made him feel unloved and unwanted, and I'm worried that if i switch to the new adoption process, he'll just find out that I stopped the adoption process and think I don't want to adopt him anymore or something.

Anyway, that's all.

Part 7

I'm turning 28 in less than a month, and I love my birthday, so me and my mom always make it into a big thing. The plan never changes in a big way because I like doing the same stuff for my special day. One of the things we do is go to a toy store or two and my mom buys me one or two toys. I still have presents that are surprises but I like picking one or two things out for myself. So usually I have a little walking around money and I get to choose something(s) I want to buy. This year I found a Luca plush online, because the movie came out. It was probably my favorite Disney movie that came out during the pandemic! I was really excited because I haven't shopped at the Disney store in a couple years and I forgot that new movies meant new plushies. I told my mom I wanted to skip Mastermind Toys, where we've been going for the past few years, and instead I wanted to go to the Disney store and get a Luca plush.. We'll be at the mall anyway because that's part of our plan. Anyway, I'm really excited for Luca to join my family!

Part 8

I'm a parent to a bunch of stuffed animals. This is an ongoing series. I've been going through the adoption process since 2017, and finally, FINALLY, I got an email from the adoption agency this morning saying the final paperwork will be processed within 24 hours! That was at 8:42 this morning, which means by the time I wake up tomorrow, he will be officially adopted! I'm buying him his favorite treats later today and I'm going to throw him a special party! I'm SO SO SO excited!

Edit for info: Yes, my son is a stuffed raccoon. He's 13 years old and the adoption process has taken about 5 years. I bought his favorite cookies for him to surprise him tomorrow!

Part 9

Yes, the kids in this are stuffed animals. There seems to be some confusion about that.

My heart is soaring right now! Despite the mixes reactions on this series I'm going to continue posting and I'm SO happy right now I don't even care about anything else!! My son went out with his brother so we could set up, but left his phone at home and my other boy's phone is dead. They said they would be home by 6 at the latest. I'm so happy that I'm officially my son's mom after so long!

Part 10

I'm a parent to a bunch of stuffed animals, and I recently adopted one of then after a long process. I'm so happy, and I ordered a copy of his original birth certificate to celebrate. I thought he might want to see it. However, when it got here on Tuesday, it had his birthdate two years from when it was supposed to be, meaning he's actually 11 instead of 13. He's been in Toronto with a bunch of his friends since last Sunday and will be there until tomorrow night. I didn't want to do this over text and I didn't want to ruin his good times, but I know I have to tell him.

Quick edit: my son just came home and texted me that he was going to bed because of how tired he was but he said he would talk to me tomorrow. It was like a ""Going to bed. Talk to you tomorrow. Love you"" text. So I will be discussing this with him. I'm nervous.

Part 11

There is a link to an explanation post down below in case you guys need more context. There's also a link to the original post below.

But basically I'm a parent to a bunch of stuffed animals, and I posted a couple days ago that tomorrow I was going to tell one of them that they were 11 and not 13. My son was away with friends.

I posted that on Sunday and it's now Tuesday. We still have not had that discussion. He came out of his bedroom Monday afternoon and I asked him if we could talk for a moment. He said he couldn't because he was running late to lunch with a friend. He left quickly before I could say much else.

Later, he texted me to let me know that he wanted to stay over at his friend's place and I asked if he could come home so we could talk. He asked me if it was an emergency and I hesitantly said no. 

I don't want to have this discussion over text. He said he wanted to stay out with his friends at least until later today. I wish I had more of an update for you all. I just don't know what's going to happen.

That's all for now.

I'm the parent to a bunch of stuffed animals (New Updates)

So, i wanted to first explain how things went with my son. He was pretty shocked when i talked to him and said he needed a little time. His brother drove him to the airport and he flew to the U.S. and was there for about a week. He came back and didn't talk to me for a while, but his baby sister talked to him and then he was fine with it for the most part. He seems kind of happy that he gets 2 11th, 12th, and 13th birthdays. 

Second, my daughter moved out in December of 2021. Many months later, in November of 2022, she came over for a visit just to tell us that everything was going ok and she wasn't sure if she would ever be back. She said she was going to travel for a while. 

While she was away, there was a lot of fighting over what would happen to her coffee shop. Eventually Shadow paid off the guy who wanted to sell it and it stayed vacant. 

Then, in late February of 2023, my son flat out refused to celebrate his birthday without his twin sister. He kept refusing party stuff, and it all came to a head when his siblings tried to throw him a birthday party and he got frustrated and smashed the cake. 

Marceline chose this moment to show up. There was a knock on the door, Marshall (her twin brother) answered it and there she was. 

We asked her how she knew and all she would say was that it was twintuition. We never really got answers to our questions beyond that. Things have mostly gone back to normal since then.

I'm the parent to a bunch of stuffed animals and my son just dropped a bombshell on me.

TW: PAST ABUSE.

Before anyone is wondering, this happened today. Also i asked my son if i could post this here and he said yes.

My son is Morty Smith from Rick and Morty. 

Up until today i thought he didn't go back to the show (he left around season 3) because he didn't like the plotlines where he was being abused by his grandpa or others (so, pretty much all of them). 

If you haven't seen the show, a few of the things that happened to him were:

1. In the pilot, his grandpa forced him to stick huge seeds up his behind in order to bypass interdimensional security.

2. A few episodes later he was r-worded by someone on an adventure that he and his grandpa went on together.

3. His grandpa constantly verbally abused him as well.

4. He was constantly put in dangerous situations as a kid instead of being allowed to enjoy life. 

5. In the vat of acid ""episode"" his grandpa made a device that mentally tormented him and then informed him that it was actually alternate versions of him who died. My son then asked how to save the alternate versions of himself and his grandpa almost forced him to take the fall for all his actions and go to jail (i think) all because he said his grandpa's idea was dumb. 

I asked him if there was any concern that his grandpa might try to get him back and take him from us. He said no and that his grandpa said if he didn't want to go on adventures then that was ""whatever"" and ""he would just get another Morty.""

Morty has been living with us the past few years. He seems happy especially in spite of everything he went through. Everyone loves him and he loves everyone.

His therapist gently guided him to tell me during his first therapy session today.

TW: BULLYING

I'm the parent to a bunch of stuffed animals, and my son is back in ballet.

So, my 11 year old son recently joined a new ballet program that opened here last week. He loves ballet but stopped going years ago because of bullying and the teacher not doing anything. 

The program that opened last week is run by a Christian woman who has the class open 6 days a week, just not Sunday, as she observes the sabbath. She also has a son, Tristyn, who is in the class as well, and he and Tails have already become friends. He's having dinner there tomorrow night.

I'm The Parent To A Bunch of Stuffed Animals (Explanation/OOC Post)

TW: MENTIONS OF ABUSE

This is a spinoff/continuation post to my ""I'm the Parent to a Bunch of Stuffed Animals"" series, which is an ongoing series. There seems to be a lot of confusion and questions about that series, so hopefully this post will clear up at least some of that.

1. I am not delusional or crazy. I do not believe this is real. There are various reasons that I choose to do this which I will get into lower down the post. I pretend this is real and i love that this is my family, regardless of knowing this isn't real, I will continue to do this. It makes me happy.

2. Yes, all the kids in the series are, in fact, Stuffed animals/dolls. They are sewn together and filled with stuffing. They are literally stuffed animals. They come from various toy stores, such as Mastermind Toys, or online. No, I do not mean foster children. No, English is not my second language. Yes, I realize they are not real.

3. I am careful about not losing myself in my fantasy world. I have healthy relationships with mainly my mom, but that is more related to the fact that i have such a hard time making friends and not because of my stuffed animals. I absolutely do not ask any of the humans in my life to play along. 

4. I realize this is the internet, and is not a catered safe space for me. I realize some people will be assholes and try to kill people's joy just for the sake of being assholes. However, I accept that not everyone will get it. I am used to mixed reactions. I will not let other people change how i feel or stop posting due to this. I take it in stride. And if they continue being jerks, that's what the block button is for. I do love engaging with people on my posts. I will answer your questions as long as you're not just being an asshole. 

5. I love my kids, and nothing will change that. I'm happy with my life. 

Now, to the question: Why do I do this? 

TW: mentions of abuse.

When I was a child, I grew up with an abusive dad. For me and my sister it was mostly emotional abuse. He would gaslight us and isolate us from everyone, including our mom. He also sexually abused me when I was a teenager.

I developed a lot of coping mechanisms. One of them was ""parenting"" my stuffed animals. I would treat them like my kids. After my dad left, I became a full on parent to my kids and started creating an entire world. It soon turned into a series with storylines and everything.

Just as an example, when I say something like, ""My son is out,"" i realize he is actually sitting by my pillow and hasn't moved. But in my mind, he is away with friends. No, they do not have cell phones. Again, that is imaginary. I cannot stress enough that I know the things I am talking about are not real. I have created this world due to my autism, trouble making friends, depression, and ptsd. This is left over from when I was a kid, only I've decided I love doing it and don't want to stop.

So what's next for the series? I'm not giving anything away as of now. There are some really hardcore storylines coming up. 

I will link this post in the comment section of all my new posts so people can read it and hopefully understand me a little better.

I'm the parent to a bunch of stuffed animals, and I spilled my guts to my support worker.

(Sept 16).

This happened today, in the early afternoon.

I have autism and depression and various disabilities so i have support twice a week. 

Today we were going shopping. I just decided to tell her everything.

I told her things my mom doesn't even know.

How my daughter moved away and doesn't talk to me, about my granddaughter who was born with health issues, about Morty and the past with his grandpa, about Rigby and his depression, about the portal and my son getting lost inside it.

I kinda skipped over the part where Rigby shot Simoce but basically everything else just came out.

We had a talk about how parents make mistakes, I'm not going to share her personal business here, but she shared her mistakes with me.

We're all human and maybe i didn't protect my kids in the past but that i can do better for them now and how if my daughter wants to reach out she will, and that she might come around. I hope she does. I miss her voice.",1,1730489891.0,MarkNarrations,0,1.0,False

slithering timeless junkies and chilly fingers back

sad sack back but I drink water now -

it makes you a bad poet bad bad poet.



Cried all night but just with my mouth

breathing with my mouth open

breathing with my mouth clasped shut



the man is awake and has to be up at 5:30

the man has to get to sleep

I could do it for him with my mouth

I could do it for him and I don’t 

it makes you a bad bad poet.



I’m next to cold eggs I don’t want to bring downstairs

didn’t finish the eggs but finished the coffee

coffee at any temperature

everything like coffee at any temperature

for sure.



when the starlight flicks off the dying leaves

when the car wavers in the rain and I think I’ve wasted my life

when I look at him and see a future without suicide

when I enjoy the feel of the sun on my face and the sound of the breeze

of my father laughing, of the squirrels falling out of the trees

the joy is cheap -

the words are gone.

1ghdsxf,https://v.redd.it/dl3cmuyxdcyd1,Temperature sensor issue (ECM Classika PID),"Hello espresso community!

I have an ECM Classika PID that I bought around 5 months ago. A great machine that gave me a lot of delicious espressos over last months. 

However, around a week ago I started having  problems with a proper extraction. Coffee became cold and soury. After cleaning and recalibrating my Niche grinder, cleaning shower screen and back flushing the machine I was looking further for solution of the problem.

At this stage I found topics about calibration of temperature offset in E61 machines. I realized that with original offset set to 17 I am not even close to boiling water when the PID is set to 100 degrees. I changed the offset to maximum 25. Now, when PID is set to 98 degrees extraction is better, close to original, but still no boiling water at 100 degrees.

I also have Profitec Go with same PID and I have correctly boiling water at 100 on PID (video in comments).

Another strange symptom I found is what PID shows just after switching from steam mode to brew mode. Previously when I finished milk frothing and wanted to get back to brew mode temperature on PID was slowly going down from 120 during purging the steam out. Now when I hit the switch it suddenly shows much below 100 degrees. I am pretty sure that it previously behave differently. 

Seller told me to send  the machine iback for warranty check but looking for some tips before that. Anyone had similar issue?

1ghdroq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ghdroq/how_to_deal_with_coworker_who_makes_you_feel/,how to deal with coworker who makes you feel stupid,"hello! i (23m) am a full time graduate student pursuing a masters degree in another state that neighbors my home state. even if i’m doing full time schooling, the bills don’t just disappear, so i work as a server three shifts a week. this is my first serving job, though not my first job ever as i’ve had a few others prior to this one when i was in high school and undergrad. 

i’ve been working here for about a month and a half maybe, and ive been having trouble with this one older woman at my job, and i don’t know what to do. i’ll admit, i don’t know the menu and drinks as well as the other servers, though this is mostly bc they’ve been there longer and they work more shifts there, but i’m not clueless. any mistakes i still make are minor, maybe forgetting to give someone a spoon with their soup, or telling a customer they can make an alteration to a dish, then having to go back to the table and explain to them that i actually can’t do that for whatever reason (e.g. they ask for a pasta dish but without a cajun seasoning, and i say ok but the cajun seasoning is in the precooked sauce or something to that effect so i have to go back to the table and explain that we can’t). regardless, i really don’t make mistakes often.

anyways, there’s this older woman bartender at my job who just makes me feel like i’m stupid. she always acts like i should know something i’ve never been told, or am expected to remember something that only applies to her. for example, today i got yelled at bc when i was cleaning up a table, i dumped out a drink in the the drain tray (essentially this rectangle that hangs on the edge of the sink and you dump drinks in there and the liquid goes through into the sink, and any ice or lemons/limes get caught there). apparently, she doesn’t like this, bc it leaks supposedly, and i got yelled at by her bc she said that she doesn’t like it and “i told you that one time already” (i dumped an old pot of coffee out bc it was full of coffee grounds, and i used the filter to stop the grounds from entering the drain, but she said to use the sink instead, and i thought she said that just bc it was a hot beverage or something idk). 

then, today a customer asked for their cocktail to have light ice, so under requests i typed in “less ice please”, and she goes and gets the manager and has the manager tell me that “light ice doesn’t mean more drink it means more ice” and asked if i told them that, and i said yes, they didn’t ask bc they wanted more drink, they asked bc the customer and her friend were chatting and didn’t like how the ice melted and watered her drink down while they are talking. he said ok that’s fine, and she went “you know why they do that right?” and i said “bc you’d be giving them more alcohol for the same price” and she scrunched her face and shook her head, giving me this look like “what are you talking about”. she said back “it’s bc it wouldn’t be a standard drink” and i said “yes, but also bc the bar would be losing money for giving away extra alcohol” and i walked away. when she is working, you aren’t allowed behind the bar. ever.

another occasion she had a customer at the bar order food, and i was eating on my break at this time bc the restaurant was empty except for two customers at the bar, so i wasn’t paying attention to the food window. as servers we each get one section, and as a bartender, she gets the bar, and the two tiny, two-person tables right by it. each server grabs their own food from the window. this is a small restaurant in terms of size, and the bar to the kitchen is not a walk at all, you can have a convo from the kitchen to the bar without using your loudest voice. you can grab your food from the window while still being in eyesight from the bar.

anyways, this customer waits there for 30 mins, and she comes over and yells at me bc she’s says it’s my job to get the food bc she’s at the bar and i’m a server (even though i wasn’t serving that table, she was bc it was the mini table by the bar, she took their order, and gave them their drinks, and EVERY other bartender will get the food, or they’ll ask a server or kitchen worker if their food is up yet). 

for the rest of the day, every time she got an order she’d say to me, alright i got an order so make sure you look at it this time, and for the rest of the day, im running her food to her table. every other bartender either gets their food, or someone brings it to their table, and if no one brings it after ten minutes they go to the kitchen and see what the hold up is. she waited 30 mins to see where her food was, then yelled at me for not bringing the food to her table. 

THEN, i hear her telling a customer at the bar that im new and how the managers told her i was done training but she doesn’t think i should be serving and all this stuff… TO A CUSTOMER. 

she also gives me all these rules NO ONE ELSE FOLLOWS. she told me not to scoop the ice with the cup, when EVERY other server does that, including the woman who trained me and has been working there for years. another time, she made a huge fuss about me wanting to sample a beer, even after i explained i was sampling it bc its on tap and i get asked my opinion on the beers on tap all the time so i have to know how they taste. everytime i work with her, i try not to say anything to her, but nearly everytime i leave, she makes me feel stupid and that im doing things i should know better about, bc she’ll squint her eyes at me and shake her head. i really can’t afford a gap in my paychecks, which is what quitting would do, and i don’t hate the job, i only hate it when she’s working bc i feel like shit after each shift. i can’t really talk about it with other coworkers bc two of her sons work in the kitchen, and a lot of the other co workers don’t seem to care about her or simply avoid her. is there anything i can do to stop myself from leaving work feeling like shit?",2,1730489477.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

1ghdrcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/1ghdrcv/dangerous_host/,DANGEROUS HOST,"Hey CS Community. I’m a straight male, in my mid-30s, and have been on CS for over a decade. I’ve hosted hundreds of people and recently have been surfing quite a bit in Latin America. This past week I had a dangerous experience with a gay, male host (also mid-30s) that you need to know about. This experience will likely result in the host leaving a negative review about me which you will soon understand why. As we all know, one negative review, true or not, can be a death sentence for a CS profile. I’ve spent the last decade building a fun and safe environment for surfers and I’m incredibly saddened that one bad actor can tarnish a reputation I spent over a decade building. I’ve written to CS Support but have concluded that they cannot take sides unless there is concrete evidence, which there is not. I want to convey the anguish and frustration I’m feeling, just so you understand—even if there’s no fair resolution. I realize my only option is to leave an honest review for my host, Miguel, and to respond thoughtfully to his review of me. I’m still reeling from the experience and by writing it down I’m hoping to get clarity. All comments and advice are welcome, especially anything that could help keep my CS profile in good standing. Here’s what went down:

My first two days with Miguel were fantastic. He was welcoming, energetic, and eager to show me around his hometown. I appreciated his playful, shit-talking banter—he reminded me of a friend from back home, so we hit it off right away. We talked about my girlfriend, so it was clear I was straight and not interested in men. During those first two days, I never felt uncomfortable or unsafe. We even started casually discussing plans for him to visit me in my hometown. This is what CS is all about!

On the third night, things took a turn. We went out downtown, bar-hopping, where I met several of his friends. We stayed out until the bars closed around 4 am. As we lingered outside, he struck up a conversation with three gay guys and invited them back to his place, which was fine with me—they were friendly, and I enjoyed practicing my Spanish with them. Back at his place, around 6 am, they all continued drinking, but I’d had enough and wanted to stop. That’s when Miguel’s demeanor shifted dramatically—a real Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde moment. His energy went from friendly to unsettling. He started pressuring me to keep drinking, insisting that I was being a ""bad wingman"" for stopping. I told him I was content without more alcohol, but each time I refused, he grew more hostile, transforming from a friend into something predatory. To add to the friction, his friends began to chime in, calling me a ""downer"" and saying I wasn’t any fun. When he realized he couldn’t pressure me into drinking, his tone changed. Like a caring mother he said, “Hey, Mike, you look tired. Why don’t you go sleep in my bed?” I declined, but he insisted, and his caring tone instantly reverted right back to one of agitation. He then demanded that I come into his room. At that moment I realized this guy was not my friend and someone I couldn’t trust.

I got up from the couch and headed to the sink to drink some water, hoping it would clear my head. As I chugged glass after glass, his friends continued hurling insults, and I started to think about how I could get out of there. Being on the fourth floor of an apartment, with my bicycle in need of repairs and all of my saddle bags, I knew an immediate escape wasn’t feasible. I kept deflecting Miguel’s advances until he finally gave up, heading to his room with one of the other guys. I seized the moment to step outside, circling the block to gather my thoughts.

Around 8 am, I found a coffee shop and stayed there for an hour to regroup. When I returned to the apartment, Miguel was still hostile. I made up my couch bed and kept repeating that I needed rest, though I wasn’t going to sleep. Eventually he left me alone and returned to his room. I stayed alert, listening as Miguel and one of the other guys got intimate in the adjacent room. Over the next hour, I planned my exit strategy. In Miguel’s current state of mind, he could not be reasoned with so I had no other choice but to leave in stealth to avoid any potential physical confrontation.

Once things quieted down, I decided I needed to repair my bike first. I began moving it outside to fix the flat tire and then buy the spare part I needed. Miguel heard me open the front door and ran out of his room asking what I was doing. I explained, and though he made a few snide comments, he didn’t stop me. I fixed the flat and got the spare part I needed. At 11 am I returned and locked my bike up out in front. I entered the apartment quietly, hoping everyone was asleep. Miguel’s door was closed so I quickly gathered my bags and ran out the door. I attached everything to my bike and left without looking back. Once I reached a hostel, I blocked him on WhatsApp and Couchsurfing.

Deep down I think that Miguel is a good guy and the booze severely impaired his judgment but unfortunately, he broke trust and from that, there’s no going back. If you believe this story then you know that Miguel is not fit to host travelers or be on the platform. I’m a confident person and didn’t back down to his demands, but had it been a less experienced person, the situation would have been horrific. Miguel is a dangerous predator who should never be able to use CS again. I have submitted this report to CS Support in the hopes they can prevent him from using CS but I know that's likely not possible since it's so easy to create an account under another name. More or less this will be my review for Miguel as long as there aren’t character restrictions on CS, since it is quite lengthy.  I’ve got another week before I need to leave a review for Miguel so if you have any suggestions on anything I should add/remove I’m all ears.",4,1730489452.0,couchsurfing,9,0.83,False

I opted to do a Thursday to Thursday diary to take advantage of participating in Hell Week at my Orange Theory Studio.

10/24- Thursday: woke up at 6 am. Today is the first day of Hell week and I fully intended to participate but I have staff at work out sick so I need to cover for them.  No work out today. I make my typical morning coffee of cold brew over ice with a bit of whole milk and some vanilla syrup. I drink this is the car on the way to work. I grab my prepacked lunch bag from the fridge and out the door to sit in traffic for over an hour. 

At work I hit the ground running. No breakfast for me today. Finally at 11am I stop for a quick bite. Unch is a bag of Caesar salad mix topped with a package of smoked salmon bite from Sams. It’s a fast efficient lunch but also tasty. I drink a zero sugar 7up Shirley Temple edition with it.  

Around 1pm I am so tired of sitting that I get up to take a quick walk abut campus. The weather here is SoCal is unaware that it is fall and it is sunny and in the 80s today. 

I leave at 4pm today because its Thursday and I have a standing dinner date to watch Thursday night football with my husband. I grew up a football fan because my dad was a coach.  Traffic sucks as always so I have my husband order Dominos for dinner. Not the healthiest but football calls for junk food.
After watching the Chargers beat the Vikings I clean up around the house a bit and decide I really want something sweet for dessert. I grab a serving of Tru Fru frozen raspberries in white and dark chocolate. These are my newest obsession.  I finally call it a night at 10pm.  

10/25- Friday: I wake up at 6am. I slept terrible last night but I have my first Hell Week class this morning.  I make my standard coffee and then get dressed. This years there for Hell Week is Zombie Types and today is No Sudden Moves. We also do them dress days and today is Throw Back Day. If you complete Hell Week (4 of 8 days of themed workouts) you get a t shirt and todays dress up option is to wear a shirt from a previous hell week. This is my 5th Hell Week so I grab one of my old tank tops from a few years ago. Its actually too big as I have lost 50lb since then.  

Today I am taking a Tread 50 class, which is a 50 minute treadmill based class. There are Strength 50 class (50 minute weights) and 1 hr traditional classes that do Tread, Rower and Weights.  I hope on my treadmill and today is 2 blocks 6 minutes each of intervals and 2 11 minutes blocks of tread of distance. I like the tread classes because while we have this outline we also can sort of do what we want. I chose to do a flat road run for the longer blocks but hills for my interval work.  At the end of my 50 minutes I am sweaty and tired. I take a fast shower in the locker room and get dressed for work. I mark the class complete on the leader board outside. I am hungry and hot. I run into the Sprouts next door and grab a bottle of chocolate milk and a banana to eat in the car on my commute to the office and a tuna salad and pretzel chip lunch pack for this afternoon. 

I work non stop teaching my interns about assistive tech today then finally eat lunch at 1pm. I have to eat between interruptions because I am alone for the afternoon and it’s a busy day. My lunch is the tuna and pretzel pack, it also has some cheese cubes and grapes. I drink my last Zero sugar 7up from the fridge.

I don’t get home until nearly 7pm. I had a 1.5hr commute home then had to stop at the grocery store because I knew I was out of milk for my coffee the next day. I stop in a my local grocery and pick up a few items that are on sale this week: Lime Le Croix, Fairlife whole milk and low fat chocolate milk, all beef smoked sausage, Halloween themed tortilla chips, ruffles, salsa and sour cream. 

At home I make myself a quick dinner of a grilled cheese, some Autumn crisp grapes and a real sugar glass bottle coke. I crash out around 10pm.

10/26- Saturday: I had planned to sleep in a little bit since I don’t have to be at the gym until 8:45am but woke up at 6am. I decide in that case I am going to have my coffee in silence before my family wakes up. I make my normal coffee and then around 7 am make a small breakfast. I generally do not like to workout with food in my stomach but also know that I won’t be able to do much completely empty.  I eat 2 hardboiled eggs with a slice of toast.

8:45am: Today these Hell Week theme is as Fast As You Can” and the dress up theme is Betelgeuse. I don’t actually have anything in that theme so I toss my hair in a pony tail with a lime green scrunchie and wear my favorite purple snack skin print set. I am doing a 1 hr class today.  It’s a combo of sprint efforts on the tread, weights with cardio drills interspersed on the floor and Rowing efforts broken up with Lunges between efforts.  Its rough. I hate rowing. Rumor has it one class will be a solid 23 minute row for distance. I plan to skip that day.
Back at home my husbands springs it on me that he wants to do a grazing board and champagne brunch for our SEC football game, We run around the corner to the store and pick up several bottles of wine and champagne and some cheeses and salami. Back at home he has to take a work call while I create our Brunch. I plate up some smoked cheddar, goat cheese with honey, beef summer sausage and hot mustard, carrots and hummus, salami and prosciutto, grapes and some crackers. I pour myself a glass of the champagne and wait for him to come watch the game. Since moving to the West Coast we have made it a bit of a tradition that if my home team plays in what counts as morning for us we watch with this type of spread. But today does not go as planned. He is constantly having to take work calls and pausing the game. I snack on a little of the food and put it away. It take use 7 hours the entire day to finish the game because of his work and I am kind mad about it. Our son mostly plays video games  and between segments where we can watch the game I do the house hold chores (laundry, dishes and some meal prep).
Finally around 6pm he signs off and we finish the game. I was annoyed because I needed to go to Aldi to do the weekly shopping plus pick up things for our Halloween party. He goes with me and we grab some baguettes, pizza sauce, broccoli, chicken breasts, BBQ sauce, lunch meat and cheese and Hawaiian rolls.  He wants to grab some tortellini for dinner but I tell him I already have some at home.  At home I cook some tortellini and a jar of marinara sauce. I also grab some frozen meatballs and cook them in the air fryer.  I head off the bed around 11pm.

10/27/24- Sunday:  I wake up again at 6:30am. My husband is already up and working. He normally doesn’t work on weekends but something is going on and he is pulling a stupid amount of hours. I surprise him though because I prepped sour dough pancake batter yesterday. I make us a breakfast of pancakes and bacon.  I also use the pancake batter to make a bunch of small waffles to freeze. Just like Eggos but less likely to get recalled.

Around 10am I head to day 3 of Hell Week.  Today is Beast Mode and Freddy Vs Jason. I wear my Camp Crystal Lake Camp Counselor T shirt.  The regular class had to do a lot of animal themed floor work like Bear Planks. But I chose to do  another Tread 50 class so I get to run on the treadmill. Todays is all about inclines. For 50 minutes I alternate between jogging and walking at inclines going up to 12. My butt is hurting after class. But I am not only 1 day away from my T shirt. The things we do for a “Prize”.

At home I have time to kill before my next day of food ball. Today I am not even bothering to wait for my husband. He tells me upfront he will be working all day. I make a batch of pumpkin breakfast cheese cakes for my breakfast for the week and then make a fruit, meat and cheese plate for lunch.  After I eat I go out to fix our Halloween decorations. The wind has been high and managed to knock down a bunch of things and completely bend the supports for my yard skeletons. After that I go inside to watch the Chiefs destroy the Raiders. During half time I prep dinner for that night. I pound out some chicken breast and then marinate them in a bottle of parmesan garlic wing sauce. I plan to grill them and then serve them with rice and a bac of parmesan roasted veggies. I also divide up and vacuum seal the rest of the family size pack of chicken and 2lbs of leftover pulled pork.  I put the packs of meat in the freezer, I also pull out a froze hashbrown casserole and put in the fridge to cook the next night.
Around 3:30pm my husband makes himself food and I realize he never had lunch and now wouldn’t want dinner until late. My son is a super picky eater, so I know he isn’t going to eat with me either. I feel my son quesadilla around 6pm and make myself  a BLTA for dinner using leftover bacon from this morning.  I take an Epsom salt bath since my muscles are killing me from the inclines and head off to sleep at 10pm.

10/28/24- Monday- I wake up late and in a rush. It is also Shot day. I am 2 yrs into using Wegovy to assist with my weight. I lost 50lbs in the first 18 months but have been holding steady since then.  Its nice that something finally worked but I wish I could lose the last 15 lbs. I had hoped for. I quickly do my shot and then rush out the door.
Its day 4 of Hell Week for me and its going to be a 50 minute upper body day. The official theme is Keep Your Head Above water which is a long row day for the regular classes. I am defiantly happy to skip that. Its Witch dress up day I toss on a t shirt that say “Not Your Basic Witch” and head out. I lift slightly lighter than normal due to my lower back feeling really tight. At the end of class I excitedly go to the front for my t shirt and discover…my shirt hasn’t arrived and they are expecting the shipment later in the week. I am mildly disappointed but try not to show it. I go get cleaned up and head to the office. 
An hour later and I walk into a disaster of students having melt downs and my staff in chaos. I am told our night shift has called out for Thursday and no one is willing to cover. As the director this means I will have to come in and end up canceling my son’s Halloween plans. I go to the bathroom to cry in frustration. I am currently interviewing for other jobs because I am over this type of thing happening. Luckily the evening appointments are able to be shifted and we can close early that night. I don’t have to cancel.
At 1pm I realize I never ate anything for breakfast this morning nor did I remember to pack my lunch. I open my desk drawer and pull out my emergency food, a can of beanie weenies. This is not a healthy choice but its fast and easy so I eat that and splurge on a real coke from the vending machine. I think about how I haven’t really planned well this week an am frustrated. Between my husband and myself our work/life balance this fall has been non-existent.
I get home around 5:30pm tonight and immediately start making dinner. I grill the chicken I marinated the night before and put a bag of parm garlic veggies in the air fryer to roast. I originally planned on rice but my husband asked for potatoes. I actually have some frozen mashed sweet potatoes  so I make those. For dessert I have one of my pumpkin breakfast cheese cakes. They are pretty decent.

10/29/24- Tuesday:
My normal morning routine, wake up at 6:30am and have my iced coffee before my commute. Today is a rest day for me and I need it. Every single muscle in my legs and arms ache. Once at work I have a Fairlife protein shake for breakfast. It’s a busy day so I am up and down the stairs in my office for most of the day and putting out fires.  Around 1pm I finally stop for lunch. I had packed leftovers from last night so I have some grilled chicken and roasted broccoli, sweet potato and onions.  As a treat I also have a palm full of Coffee caramel cashews. 
There was a major issue with a student at work tonight and I ended up staying in the office until nearly 11pm. Because of my night blindness my husband convinces me to just stay at a hotel in the town I work in instead of driving an hour home.  I ordered Door dash at work and regret it. I got Sonic, a chili dog, tots and a coke. My stomach feels like I swallowed a brick.  
At midnight I lay down and sleep restlessly all night.  

10/30/24- Wed: 
I was up at 7:50am after a restless night of sleep. I get dressed, I luckily had a se of clean clothes in my gym bag so the unexpectant night away wasn’t that big of deal. I started keeping a change of clothes and some toiletries in my trunk because shockingly these late nights at work are rare but not unheard of.
Since I am not at home I go to a local coffee shop for a coffee. I get a season drink called a Vanilla Spice. It’s a hot vanilla latte with whole milk and a spice blend. The overwhelming taste is clove and I am not a fan.
Once I get to the office I grab a packet of instant grits with bacon in it and make it in the office microwave. I spend the day working and around noon take a short walk around campus. For lunch I grab a packet of trail mix and a string cheese from the office fridge. I remind myself to do more fridge stock prep for next week.
I leave work around 3pm and head home. Once back in my town I stop at the grocery store to grab sugar and eggs. I am entering  a baking competition at work for Halloween and needed a few things.
At 5pm I go with my husband to take my son to his therapy appointment. He sees a therapist every 2 weeks to work with him on his ADHD and emotional regulation. While he is in therapy we wait at a restaurant in the same shopping center. We just grab drinks. I get a lemon drop martini and we talk.  After therapy we get home and I make a fast dinner of ground turkey tacos. I make mine a taco salad with romaine, tomato, black beans, corn, turkey taco meat, a bit of cheese and a dressing made of Mexican Crema, lime juice and hot salsa. After dinner I make my cup cakes for the next day. I make a pumpkin spice latte cup cake. I go to bed around 11pm.
10/31/24- Thursday
6am: I wake up and make my coffee. I am out the door early to get to work to help set up for the employee Halloween event we have.  For breakfast I have an apple and Fairlife Protein shake. 
At noon I walk to ¾ mile from my office to the location of the event. I did not win the baking competition but my coworker in my office does and I am really excited for her. Apparently I got 2nd.  The lunch was actual Mexican style street tacos. I get 2 carnitas tacos with rice and pinto beans and a full sugar coke.  I don’t eat any of the sweets.  I walk back to the office.  I leave early today at 2pm so I can get home and get things ready for my sons Halloween get together.
For Halloween night I make a bunch of finger foods for a grazing table. We have spooky shape chicken nuggets, pizza rolls, ham and cheese sandwich sliders, chips and dips, a fruit and a veg platter and cup cakes and sugar cookies.  I make espresso martinis and maple bourbon old fashions for the adults. 
I have 1 martini and a small plate of carrots with ranch, a few nuggets and pizza rolls. I take my son and his friends trick or treating at by the time we get home my tracker says we walked nearly 3 miles.
I crash out around 11pm.

Help me choose a pannier. ,"I'm trying to choose between the Arkel (picture 1) Signature C, (2) Signature M, (3) Metropolitan.

Signature C is water resistant but not waterproof and has handy outside pockets; Signature M is waterproof but no handy outside pockets; Metropolitan is waterproof and has outside pockets, very practical, but I don't like how it looks as much.

I use my bike for transportation, and this pannier would be for going to meetings, coffee shops, errands etc. These panniers all have laptop pockets and room for a jacket, change of clothes, etc. The pannier doesn't need to look particularly professional, but I'd like it to look reasonably nice.  I would prefer waterproof and outside pockets, but I also want it to look nice.

The blue ones match my shopping panniers, and I'll often use it with one of those, but this isn't a critical detail.

So i had my first bumble date earlier this week, it was my first time going on date with someone off an app and just i guess someone random in general. But the date i think went well, we just went for coffee and talked for while was like a 3 hour date. I can get a bit shy and in general am new to the whole dating scene again so maybe i forget how to do things BUT anyways i think we both had a good time i even offered to bring her home earlier cause she said she had something to do but she declined and wanted to stay out longer with me so i really dont know what to think, in terms of how she enjoyed herself. 

I brought her home when we were done gave her a hug in the car and she told me to text her when i got home before i left, which i did and i was kinda prepared for like our convo to end there but she continued on a conversation basically until bed time. But when the next day came the texts were very dry and just barely texted (maybe like 2 text exchanges) but prior to our date we texted steady and a good amount. So i kinda just dont know what to think or do. I did really enjoy my time and would like to take her out for dinner and drinks or something but unsure.",1,1730489334.0,Bumble,5,1.0,False

1ghdmdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuzanneMorphew/comments/1ghdmdd/strange/,strange,"what irritates me a bit with this case is the follwing taking all assumptions together:

killer is a known person:

the killer sedates the victim 1st crime scene

the killer shoots the victim at home? bullet found? 

the killer fakes  an abduction (bike) 2nd crime scene

the killer carries evidence around to trash places 3rd crime scene

the killer burries the remains at the known places  4th crime scene



killer is a stranger:

  
the killer abducts the victim

the killer shoots and sedates the victim- why shooting and sedation? if the victim is gone anyway and the killer was successful with abduction why sedation which might be lethal? doesnt make sense

the killer burries the remains at the known place  4th crime scene

  
For me the stranger theory seems a bit off. Why lethal sedation and shooting?

  
Back to the known persons: i think there was an ex lover and her husband.

  
I still find it a bit despicable that her EX bf although he knew there is a murder investigation did not say a puh.

He easily could have told FBI to stay silent about his affair but could have told what he knew.

Maybe a second check of his Alibi is necessary.

  


On the other hand this husband who talks about mountain lions. A hunter. Bizarre.

But why would he sedate her in the evening claiming he runs after chipmunks, in the morning she drinks coffee?

Is there any other reason running around erratic the evening before he might have killed his wife next day?

It is all confusing.

Something is off with the timeline.

We do not know enough. Maybe assumptions have to be corrected.

1ghdm8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelNoPics/comments/1ghdm8a/my_tier_list_of_cities_ive_visited/,My tier list of cities I've visited,"My ranking is based on what I think makes sense for a 1 week trip. Not livability or an overnight. 1 week, just traveling and seeing stuff.

S tier:

Naples, Italy. Lived here for a month and a half. Holy shit the food and coffee is enough to win me over. On top of that there is so much to do. Lots of castles and museums and honestly just walking the streets is a fun past time. It's got some grit to it, which I kinda like. Makes it feel real. Not much green space would be my only complaint. Very minimal tourism.

Vienna, Austria. Very modern and clean city with cool history. There's a lot of cultural stuff to see here like plays and symphonies and opera and such. Museums, food is meh, almost brings it down to a tier.

Athens, Greece. I went in the off season of tourism but I'm sure it's very touristy in the summer but I had a great time in January.

Similarly Santorini, Greece for basically the same reasons at the same time of year. Felt like we had the island to ourselves and we could connect with the locals. Santorini in June is f tier tho. The hike from Fira to Oia is hard, but rewarding.

Copenhagen, Denmark. Biggest drawback is the food is better than average but not the best. The city literally feels like a utopic modern paradise.

Amsterdam, Netherlands. I want to live here. Food is great, the vibe of the city is awesome. Drunk / high people can be annoying sometimes but they mostly keep to themselves

A tier:

Berlin, Germany. Some bias here since I lived here. Lots to do, culturally very interesting. Only reason it's not S tier is because it's different from the rest of Germany so I'm not sure you'd be getting an authentic German experience.

Reykjavik, Iceland. Amazing food. It's actually hard to find bad food here. Very interesting place to explore with just weird and out there history. The rest of Iceland is amazing to explore and the nature is stunning, but the largest town is interesting even without all that.

Rome, Italy. Biggest draw back is tourism. Food, stuff to do, museums are all awesome.

Prague, Czech Republic.

Hamburg, Germany. My biggest issue is that everything is a bit spread out. 

Pittsburgh, USA. Great food, lots of fun stuff to do. Amazing urban fabric but little public transportation and downtown is kinda boring.

Bologna and Florence, Italy. Cool and all and world class museums and good food. Basically imagine everything that's good about Paris, but make it italian and turn down the amount of tourists.

B tier:

Paris, France. I think with Paris what you see is what you get. It can be idyllic and serene and very romantic feeling and it can also feel like a scummy place. Depends where ya are and what you're doing. Food CAN be really good but can also be garbage. In general, tourism seems inversely proportional to how good things are. Lourve I don't really enjoy. The tower is cool. History is neat. I think everyone should visit but it's not my top place to go to.

Avignon, France. Avignon has cool history, isn't super touristy and has some good food. Not much to do though for a whole week so b tier.

Budapest, Hungary.

Oslo, Norway. Cool city and great museums (the Munch Museum is my favorite art museum) but the food is meh. Get ethnic food if you are here (which is great) and avoid traditional Norwegian food.


C tier:

Breccia, Italy. I don't remember much about this place but was staying here for a few days. It's a smaller more quiet town.

Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. There's a beach I guess.

Memphis, Tennessee. Good food, some cultural stuff to do but not enough for a week's worth.

Dallas, Texas. Certainly lots to do and good food. Infrastructure is terrible, drivers are awful.

D tier:

Heidelberg, Germany. The castle is pretty cool but not enough stuff for a week of travel. Food is meh.

Toronto, Canada. Not much to do. Food can be good or bad depending where you go. Drake is from here.

Indianapolis, Indiana. Very little to do, but kinda nice for a day or two.

Stockholm, Sweden. Boring. Bad food.

F tier:

Barcelona, Spain. Boring. Everything feels kinda fake compared to the rest of Spain. There are good cafes I like here. It might be a nice place to live, but to go visit. Idk not for me.

Venice, Italy. Everything is a tourist trap. You cannot take 2 steps without someone trying to solicit something from you or scam you. I challenge you to go to one restaurant without them charging you a 20€ ""seating fee"" or something like that.",0,1730489071.0,TravelNoPics,3,0.5,False

1ghdjwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_valley_lemon/comments/1ghdjwg/how_to_get_to_work_on_time_every_time_with_adhd/,How to get to work on time every time with ADHD,"Put your phone away. Buy an alarm clock and charge the phone overnight in your leaving-the-house bag next to the door you leave through.  

Prepare to leave the house the night before. Pack your breakfast and lunch and keep it in a bag in the fridge. Everything else goes in the bag by the door. Set out your outfit. Bathe. Do everything that can possibly be offloaded to the night before, the night before.  These things should be part of your evening/pre-bed routine.

If your hair takes up too much time and forces a lot of morning effort, get a haircut.  High-maintenance hairdos are for when you have an established working system that leaves you room for that kind of optional additional task.

Go to bed without a phone.  If you have reasons someone might need to emergency contact you in the night, get the most featureless prepaid burner you can find and give that number only to those who might need it.

Time your morning tasks so you know how long they take without a phone. Buy a cheap travel alarm for each task and set the alarm for when you must **stop** each task.

Figure out the math: what time do you need to walk out the door to get to work on time on an average day? Now subtract an hour from that\*. You're going to walk out the door at X:XX whether you're ready or not.

Now reverse engineer from that: what critical tasks must you get done before X:XX? Get out of bed, get dressed, hair and makeup as applicable, tend to children and pets? 

So let's say you have to be at work at 9am. It takes 35 minutes door-to-door on an average day to get there, so subtract the extra hour plus that, and now you have to walk out the door at 7:25. You need 10 minutes for morning bathroom and hygiene, 15 minutes for hair and makeup and getting dressed, no pets or kids. We're going to add a 10-minute final check to make sure you have everything gathered in your leaving-the-house bag(s) so:

* Leave your property AT 7:25
* Final check and make a go-cup of coffee if applicable 7:15-7:25
* Hair and makeup 7:00-7:15
* Bathroom and teeth 6:50-7:00
* Alarm goes off at 6:50
* If necessary, set an alarm for 6:15 just to take your meds and eat a few almonds or other easy shelf-stable stomach-padding, then roll over and go back to sleep

When you get to work, you'll have about an hour to eat the breakfast you packed, drink your coffee, fart around on your phone, read a book, whatever. These are luxuries, they wait until you're right there at work.  **But they are also your dopamine, your treat, your sacred morning time.  When you think about this time, hype it up, become protective of it, do not treat it like ""extra time"" you can use to delay leaving the house.**

You really need to send the message to your nervous system that this is inviolable. There's no more ""really mean to"" because intent *doesn't work for us*, this is deadly serious because you have to work to pay rent and buy food. Put a work outfit (including shoes) in your car or your bag, to indicate how serious it is - you will go to work in your pajamas if you have to, because you walk out the door at 7:25 no matter what.

Critical mindset reminders: 

* There is no time travel.  Everything takes some amount of time, and lying about how long it takes does not magically make it take less time.  If you have to add a morning task, *you have to move your wake-up time back to accommodate it*.  I have to feed the cat and scoop the litter box, that's 5 extra minutes.  On Thursdays I have to drag the trash bins to the curb, that's 5 extra minutes (that I insert between ""final check/coffee to go"" so I do actually lock the door, put my stuff in the car, do the bins, and then have to be hitting the power button in my car at 7:25).
* The fewer tasks you have to do in the morning, the less opportunity there is for disasters!  All the more reason to offload as much as possible to the night before.
* Make and post physical checklists if you need to.  If ""hair and makeup"" tends to wander off track, go do the whole process (no phone) and write down and time each step.
* Be your own hypeperson!  Don't tell your nervous system how awful this all is, talk it up!  Congratulate yourself on how much nicer it feels to have a plan, how pleasant it is to have a system that runs more smoothly, pat yourself on the back for taking this seriously.  Make a point of enjoying it, you are teaching your body that this is good actually.
* Keep moving.  We have a joke in our home about sitting being quicksand.  Obviously if you need to sit for actual practical reasons, do that, but don't make it cozy.
* **Do not break the seal.**  If you are already chronically late to work, it's because you were late once and it wasn't too big a deal, so why not twice, so why not 100 times?  You've ""broken the seal"" on the sacredness of that timely arrival, and now you're pretending it's not going to bite you in the ass eventually.  Even if your workplace is extremely loosey-goosey with working hours, you should pick something and stick to it, because it's just an easy way to look better and more professional and more organized.  But if it does actually matter, I promise you someone is noticing and you are not ""getting away with it"" like you are telling your nervous system you are.  So the overarching rule is: you walk out the door at Walking Out The Door time, and the *only* exception to that rule is because you're going to the emergency room/vet or have been called to your child's school instead.

\*If you are operating on a really small scale, like you live 5m from work or in a small town with a brief commute that's never going to be subject to surprise bad traffic, you can drop down to 30 minutes once you've passed a proof-of-concept period in your first weeks of the job.",1,1730488900.0,u_valley_lemon,0,1.0,False

I took my test today in person from the test site and received my provisional pass! I have to say that I couldn’t have done it without this group! Here is what I did in 3 weeks while working full time and parent of 2 ages 10 & 12.

- DM Udemy course, completed the whole course in 1 week. Utilized all of my extra downtime to watch video’s and listened to it almost constantly. Then registered to it. And then listened again. 

- Joined this Reddit group, read post daily and tailored my learning based off what worked for others.

- PMI Study Hall, took all mini exams and averaged between 40’s-80’s first time taking them. Reviewed all wrong answers and retook until I understood mindset and was getting 100. 3 Full Length Exams where I got 62,64,62. Don’t feel defeated by your test scores use them to push you!!! The study hall videos were a waste of time for me.

- DM YouTube videos for PMP test questions. I would listen to him read them, pause pick the answer and see if I was right. I started tracking my average of correct answers until I was comfortably at 5/6 correct.

- Bought the Third Rock Cheat sheet but honestly never even looked at it.

- 30 min before the test I relistened to DM Mindset Video twice and soaked it in.

- I ate a small high protein breakfast, 1 cup of coffee, and brought a bottle of water and protein bar with me for the break.

- I suggest taking the breaks, moving around, focusing on something other than a screen then get back to it.

Hope this helps someone the way all the posts helped me! Good luck to all of you out there! Looking forward to seeing what my scores were.😁",8,1730488893.0,pmp,0,1.0,False

Hello!  I'm wondering if any of you may have tips on how to correct the finish on my coffee table.  I did reach out to the manufacturer, who hasn't gotten back to me at this point.  The specs indicate that it's painted veneer.  We put a pizza box on it and I'm unsure if it was maybe too hot, too wet, or a combo of those things that did it.

I think it makes me look bored, uninteresting, plain, common and flat 100%. I don't deny the fact that some people might look average and good suitable with brown eyes but when it comes to myself I just feel so inadequate and dead staring with such undesirable darkness. I guess I inherited the trait from my family (we are all Latin) and I'm still thinking it's dull and boring. Perhaps it's just internalized colorism or hidden racism (not intentionally) I have seen media portraying lighter eyes as the standard beauty and I feel they are right about it. From Light brown, Caramel, Amber, Hazel, Green, Blue, Gray and shades between these colors and mixed are richer and creatives unlike dark brown/black. I know eyes also works for the gift of sight which I am grateful for (I suffer from sensitive dry eyes 👀 which avoid me to carry colored contacts unfortunately and if I do, I would feel fake after all) But the rest of it, I think I just feel hatred, discomfort and other emotions that only makes me feel sorry myself and entirely plain. I wish a lighter brown will do the right thing for me, Amber or green etc except the ugly brown-black. I have never had any compliments in person about my eyes color 👁️ since they lack of life and don't even slightly change against the sunlight at ALL. I feel it but I understand honestly. Having Dark Brown hair doesn't help either. My pale skin which at don't complain at least, would do better and hide my eye bags if it wasn't for the extreme darkness of the iris that makes me think enhance my dark circles around my eye area like a zombie. I really wish a lighter shade will harmonize my sight zone bringing down my unpleasant looking sleepy stare when I just focus my dark eyes into something or someone, this honestly makes me extremely unsatisfied, and the fact I have read people start calling them (about the color in general) ""Mocha Dark"" ""Black Coffee"" ""Root Beer"" ""Black Pools"" etc as a way to romantize them makes the whole situation even more inconvenient since it seems like that's just a failed attempt to make somebody feels good while feeling sorry for them about the trait they have, in this case (dark brown eyes) which has nothing especial about at least in my persona (I would trade them any day of the week) unlike warming light brown, bright gold, sweet caramel, candid honey, exotic amber or unique enigmatic green, or piercing striking blue or fascinating silver gray and other blends together that brings the richness that colored eyes are supposed to. I find my combo shade (dark hair and eyes) in many members of my family and that reminds me a part of myself that I deeply reject.",0,1730488552.0,confessions,0,0.5,False

One question for this group is positioning of the portafilter when locked in. I’m used to most machines I’ve owned where the portafilter locks in at 90° or perpendicular to the machine, but mine is not really going past 45° (see photo below) without a ton of force. Most stock photos I’ve seen and posts from this sub show the portafilter locked in at 90° so wondering if this is an issue with the basket, portafilter gasket, or something else?

The other odd thing is that the double spout does not sit squarely on the bottom of the portafilter so in addition to the portafilter at 45° in the group head, the double spouts are not lining up even with the machine so when pulling a shot into 2 cups (which I’ll probably never do) instead of sitting cups side by side, or 9 and 3 on a clock, they’d need to sit at 11 and 5, or thereabouts.

Neither are a huge deal, just sort of odd and annoying so wondering if I should reach out to Chris’ Coffee to resolve or if this is pretty normal. Thanks in advance for the responses!",1,1730488290.0,ranciliosilvia,4,1.0,False

1ghd400,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SirBigdog01/comments/1ghd400/story_mirrors_of_fate_chapter_2/,Story: Mirrors of Fate - Chapter 2,"Jason wasn’t sure what had changed, but everything felt different since that night at the fair. In the days that followed, it was as if a door had opened, one he’d never thought to look for. Their days blurred together, a steady rhythm of texts, late-night conversations, and casual meet-ups at places they’d soon come to consider their own. He’d never met anyone with whom conversation flowed so naturally, as though every sentence was merely an extension of something they’d been saying forever. She laughed easily, talked about things he’d never thought of, and made the world feel larger and more vibrant. There was an effortless ease between them that defied explanation, an unspoken connection that drew him in deeper each time they were together.

Jason had never felt so at ease with someone, nor had he ever felt so thoroughly pulled out of his own comfort zone. Lily’s spontaneity brought out a side of him he rarely let see the light of day—the part of him that wanted to explore, to embrace the unfamiliar, to jump without looking. And the more time he spent with her, the more he saw their differences, but he couldn’t deny how much he craved her presence.

They met at the local park one crisp Saturday afternoon, the air carrying the sweet, earthy scent of fall. Leaves crunched beneath their feet as they wandered along the winding paths, golden and red, scattering in their wake. Lily was talking animatedly about an art class she’d just started, her hands punctuating each word as if trying to bring her thoughts to life. She had a way of lighting up when she talked about her projects, and today was no different. Her face glowed as she described her latest piece—a swirling nightscape filled with stars she was trying to capture from memory, with deep blues blending into purples and greens.

“It’s like… I don’t know,” she said, struggling to find the right words. “The sky, it’s just so alive. When you look up at it, you don’t just see stars, you see this whole universe out there, moving and changing. I want to paint that feeling, like there’s something just beyond what we can see.”

Jason nodded, captivated by the intensity in her voice, even though he didn’t understand much about painting. “I’ve never thought of it that way,” he admitted. “For me, the sky’s always just been… peaceful. Like something solid and dependable.”

Lily laughed, her eyes sparkling as she looked up at him. “Of course you would see it that way. You’re so grounded, Jason. You see order in things, patterns, even when they’re just chaos. Me? I see the chaos and want to dive right in.”

He chuckled, feeling a slight blush creep into his cheeks. “Maybe you’re rubbing off on me. I mean, before I met you, I never would’ve thought about seeing the sky like that.”

“Good!” she said with a grin. “Everyone needs a little chaos now and then. And you know what? I think you could use a bit more of it.”

He laughed, unable to deny the thrill he felt at the idea. But beneath the laughter, he felt a sense of grounding he hadn’t realized he’d been missing. There was something exhilarating about being near her, something that made him feel more alive. Yet, as close as he felt to her, their differences were always there, like two halves of a whole that had never quite fit together until now.

They walked on, discussing everything from art to music to the little quirks of their families. Lily’s stories were vibrant, filled with spontaneity and moments of impulsive decision-making. She told him about her mom’s “art days,” when she’d cover the entire kitchen in newspaper and paint with abandon, and her dad’s tendency to disappear into long “philosophical musings” that bordered on passionate debates. Her family sounded chaotic and warm, like a house filled with a thousand colors all at once.

Jason’s family, on the other hand, was structured, orderly, predictable. His mom was meticulous about keeping the house clean, organizing things into neat compartments, a trait that extended into every part of their lives. His dad was a reserved, practical man, the kind who preferred his life planned out five years in advance, with no surprises. To Jason, they had always been the definition of stability—a steady presence, unwavering.

“Your family sounds… intense,” Lily said with a grin, tilting her head. “But in a good way, I mean. Like, I bet they always know where their car keys are.”

He laughed, nodding. “Oh yeah. My mom’s actually got a little bowl by the door where she makes us all leave our keys. It drives her nuts if we don’t use it.”

Lily laughed, her laughter carrying on the breeze. “That is so not my family. I don’t think my mom’s ever known where her keys are. She just… trusts the universe to help her find them eventually.”

He shrugged, grinning. “Guess it comes with the territory. My parents are both engineers, so I think it’s hardwired in me or something. I grew up hearing about the ‘scientific method’ before I could even spell it.”

“That explains a lot,” Lily teased, but there was a warmth in her smile, as if she found his practicality charming. “My mom’s an artist, too. She says artists have to learn to follow the currents of inspiration, even when it makes no sense. My dad, though, he’s nothing like her. He’s all business—structured, exact, super grounded. But I think that’s why they work together.”

Jason found himself smiling at the contrast between their families. “My family’s kind of the opposite. They’re both logical thinkers. My mom is super organized, practically schedules our whole lives down to the minute. My dad… well, he’s got a whole room in our house full of charts and diagrams for things like ‘financial projections’ and ‘project timelines.’ Sometimes I think he organizes his dreams.”

Lily’s laugh rang out, her eyes sparkling with delight. “Oh, wow. But I can see it. You’re like this calm, collected person who probably never forgets an assignment or misses a deadline.”

Jason shrugged, smiling sheepishly. “Well, I guess you’re not wrong.”

As they continued down the path, Jason became aware of little details that seemed both familiar and oddly unsettling. The way Lily laughed—open and genuine—reminded him of his younger sister, Sarah. And the color of her eyes, that clear, deep green, was eerily similar to his mom’s. But in Lily, those features carried a spark he hadn’t seen in his own family, a fire that seemed ready to blaze out of control at any moment.

And then there was her dad. Jason had only heard bits and pieces about him from Lily, but he’d seen a photo of him on her phone—a tall, lean man with dark hair and piercing eyes. The resemblance to Jason’s father was uncanny, almost unsettling. But while Jason’s father was practical to the point of being predictable, Lily’s dad sounded like a man driven by restless energy, always moving from one idea to the next, fueled by some inner fire Jason couldn’t quite understand.

These little similarities started popping up everywhere. Lily’s brother, who she described as quiet and thoughtful, sounded an awful lot like Jason’s sister Sarah, who was shy but observant, content to fade into the background. Jason couldn’t shake the feeling that their families were mirror images—physically similar in so many ways but fundamentally different in personality, like reflections in a distorted mirror.

These little oddities nagged at him, making his mind itch with a need to understand, to explain the unexplainable. He told himself it was just a coincidence, but a part of him couldn’t shake the feeling that it was more than that. For someone as rooted in logic as he was, it was an unsettling thought. But with Lily, these boundaries between what made sense and what didn’t seemed to blur.

“So,” Lily said, nudging him out of his thoughts, “you ever wonder why we’re so different? I mean, it’s almost like we come from opposite worlds.”

He smiled, though her words struck a chord. “Yeah, I guess so. Maybe that’s why we get along so well—balance or something.”

“Maybe.” She looked at him thoughtfully, her expression unreadable. “Or maybe the universe just knew we’d need each other.”

Jason felt a chill, remembering the distant thunder from the night of the fair, the strange sensation that had passed between them. He wanted to brush off the eerie feeling, but it lingered, a whisper in the back of his mind.

They fell silent, their footsteps crunching over the fallen leaves, the autumn air cool and sharp. As they walked, he felt the weight of questions that seemed to hang in the air, questions he didn’t know how to ask, let alone answer.

One evening, as they sat tucked into a cozy corner of a dimly lit coffee shop, the conversation drifted, as it often did, to stories of their families and upbringings. A candle flickered on the table between them, casting a warm glow over Lily’s face as she listened intently, her chin resting on her hand, her eyes on him with that steady, inviting gaze that always made him feel a little braver.

Jason was telling her about his family’s rituals, the unwavering structure that had defined his childhood. “My mom is the queen of routine,” he said, smiling at the memory. “Dinner was at exactly 6:30 every night, no exceptions. She even had this little dinner bell she’d ring, like we were living in some storybook. And my dad—well, he has this habit of giving ‘life advice’ every chance he gets. He calls them ‘guidelines for the future,’ but we all know they’re just mini lectures.”

Lily grinned, her fingers tracing the rim of her coffee mug. “That’s so charming, though. I mean, yeah, kind of intense, but it sounds like there’s a lot of love in those routines.”

Jason chuckled, nodding. “There is. It’s like their way of keeping everything grounded. My dad always says, ‘If you don’t know where you’re going, make sure you know where you are.’ I think that sums up my family pretty well.”

Lily’s smile softened, a distant look passing over her face. “It’s funny,” she said, her voice gentle, as if she were weighing each word. “Your mom sounds a lot like mine… but at the same time, they’re worlds apart. My mom’s organized too, but in this really… chaotic way. She’ll block off ‘creative time’ on her calendar, but then end up using it for whatever strikes her in the moment. One time, she set aside an hour to paint, but by the end, she’d rearranged the entire living room because she ‘needed a new perspective.’” Lily laughed, her eyes bright. “My dad calls it organized chaos.”

Jason laughed along with her, though a strange, quiet unease settled in the back of his mind. It was a small thing, he told himself, just an odd coincidence. But he couldn’t shake the feeling that it was more than that. Somehow, every story, every quirk, every habit their families had in common felt less like happenstance and more like echoes—reflections of one another across some unseen divide.

He took a sip of his coffee, the warmth grounding him for a moment. But the thought lingered, a question that refused to fade. “You ever wonder why we have all these little similarities?” he asked, trying to keep his tone light but unable to fully mask the curiosity—and unease—in his voice.

Lily shrugged, a slight smile playing at the corners of her mouth as she watched him. “Maybe it’s just the universe’s way of telling us we were meant to meet. Or maybe…” She paused, her gaze drifting as if she were searching for the right words. “Maybe we’re just weirdly in sync.”

Jason’s laughter was more nervous this time. “Weirdly in sync… yeah, maybe that’s it.”

But the unease lingered, growing almost palpable between them, as though there was something unsaid, something hiding just below the surface. He could see the hint of it in her expression too, the way her fingers played absently with the edge of her sleeve, her eyes distant as though she was grappling with thoughts she couldn’t quite voice.

After a moment, she looked back at him, her smile gone soft and thoughtful. “Do you believe in… fate?” she asked, her voice barely louder than a whisper, as though saying the word out loud might make it real.

He hesitated, feeling an odd weight in her question. “I’m not sure. I’ve always been more of a logic kind of guy. You know, A leads to B, cause and effect…” He paused, considering his next words. “But with you, sometimes it feels like there’s something more. Like we were… meant to cross paths.”

Her eyes lit up, a soft, almost haunted smile tugging at her lips. “I feel it too. Like there’s this connection between us, something bigger than either of us can explain.”

Jason shifted in his seat, his fingers tightening around his coffee cup. He wanted to brush off the feeling, to laugh it away as he usually did when things got a little too mystical for his liking. But with Lily, the strange, inexplicable feeling was impossible to ignore. She seemed to exist on a different wavelength, pulling him into a world of spontaneity and possibility he never would have ventured into alone.

“Maybe that’s all it is,” he said finally, attempting a smile. “Just a really, really intense coincidence.”

But Lily didn’t look convinced. She leaned in, her gaze locked on his, and in that moment, the hum of the coffee shop faded away. “What if it’s more than that?” she asked, her voice quiet but filled with a gravity that made his heart skip. “What if we’re… connected, somehow? Like, our lives were always meant to intersect, even if we don’t know why.”

Jason felt a strange thrill at her words, an almost dizzying sense that she was putting voice to something he’d felt but couldn’t name. His rational mind wanted to argue, to dismiss it as nothing more than a product of their attraction, of spending so much time together. But another part of him, the part that had been quietly whispering since the night of the fair, wondered if there was something more.

He shook his head, trying to ground himself. “You make it sound like some kind of… cosmic alignment,” he said, his attempt at a joke falling flat as his own words echoed strangely in his ears.

“Maybe it is,” she replied, undeterred, her gaze unwavering. “Maybe there are forces out there—things we don’t understand—that pull us together, people we’re meant to meet.”

Her words hung in the air between them, the weight of them settling over him, stirring something deep inside. And for a moment, Jason felt as though they were standing on the edge of something vast and unknowable, like the world as he knew it had stretched to reveal something just beyond his grasp.

They sat in silence, her words reverberating in his mind as he tried to reconcile them with his usual worldview. The idea that they could be bound by some unseen force felt almost laughable—his logical mind instinctively wanted to brush it off, to tease her for being so fanciful. But something about the intensity in her gaze stopped him, made him wonder if maybe, just maybe, there was more to this connection than he’d thought.

Lily glanced around the coffee shop, her eyes flickering from wall to wall as if something were slightly off. “You know… I swear the walls weren’t this color last time I was here.”

Jason blinked, looking around the small café. The walls were a familiar deep green, a cozy, earthy color that matched the dim lighting and mismatched furniture. He’d been here countless times, and as far as he could remember, the walls had always been that shade.

“Really?” he asked, frowning slightly. “They’ve always been green as far as I know. I don’t think they’ve changed since I first started coming here.”

Lily tilted her head, her brows knitting together in concentration. “Huh,” she said, almost to herself. “That’s weird. I could’ve sworn they used to be… I don’t know, a warm brown or maybe even a dark blue.”

Jason chuckled, trying to lighten the sudden heaviness that had settled between them. “Are you sure you’re not thinking of some other place?”

She laughed softly, though the puzzled expression didn’t leave her face. “Yeah, maybe. It just felt like I’d been here before when the walls were a different color. But I must be losing my mind.”

She shook her head, brushing it off, but a strange, thoughtful silence lingered between them. Jason wanted to say something to ease the tension, to dismiss the odd comment, but the unease tugged at him. It was a small thing, just a passing remark, but something about it felt… wrong, like a detail that didn’t quite fit. And as he looked at her, the flicker of understanding he’d noticed before was still there in her eyes, mirroring something he felt but couldn’t name.

In that moment, looking into her gaze, it didn’t feel impossible. It felt as though she were a reflection of a hidden part of himself, a connection beyond explanation, as though she held some piece of him he hadn’t known was missing. And despite every instinct to brush it off, to hold onto his familiar logic, he found himself caught in that gaze, wondering if maybe she was right.

Over the next few weeks, their relationship deepened in ways Jason hadn’t expected. Each day seemed to reveal a new layer to Lily, a new piece of her world that felt just out of reach but irresistible all the same. She was constantly pulling him into her orbit, introducing him to parts of life he’d never thought to explore—spontaneous outings, unexpected detours, and adventures that left him feeling like he was experiencing life on a different frequency. With Lily, everything felt heightened, as if the world had turned up its brightness and warmth.

They would skip classes to chase sunsets, hiking to high points on the edge of town, or spend hours stargazing on a chilly night, pointing out constellations while their breath hung in visible puffs in the night air. Jason found himself staying up until dawn with her, debating philosophy and the mysteries of the universe over cups of tea, talking about everything and nothing, the conversations deepening with each hour. He caught himself letting go of his careful routines, embracing the unexpected, her energy breaking down his usual walls one impulsive decision at a time.

And yet, no matter how close they became, a strange feeling lingered in the background. Sometimes, he’d catch her staring off into the distance, her expression distant and pensive, like she was lost in a thought too complex or too heavy to share. He could sense a quiet struggle behind her eyes, as if she, too, felt the pull of something unseen. There were moments when they’d be laughing, sharing a quiet moment, only for her gaze to drift, her smile to falter, like she was trying to remember something she couldn’t quite grasp.

The closeness they shared was undeniable, their lives intertwining in a way that felt almost predestined. Yet there was something separating them too, an invisible thread that both connected and distanced them, hinting at a deeper truth just out of reach. It was a barrier neither of them could name, an unseen weight pressing down on them both.

One night, as they sat on a hill overlooking the city, watching the lights twinkle like distant stars, Jason felt the tension grow too much to ignore. The silence between them was heavy, the kind that begged for unspoken truths to be brought to light. He hesitated, searching for the right words, but the question had been pressing at him for too long to keep silent.

“Lily… do you ever feel like… I don’t know, like there’s something off about all of this?” he asked, his voice barely a whisper.

Lily turned to look at him, her eyes reflecting the glow of the city below, her face softened by the shadows of the night. A flicker of understanding passed over her expression, as though she’d been waiting for him to ask. She bit her lip, hesitating before she spoke.

“Sometimes, yeah,” she admitted softly, her voice tinged with a vulnerability he rarely saw. “It’s like there’s something pulling us together, something bigger than just… us. But also, there’s this feeling that we’re only seeing part of it, like there’s this bigger puzzle we’re part of and we don’t have all the pieces.”

Jason nodded, feeling a chill that had nothing to do with the cool night air. “I can’t shake the feeling that there’s more to this than we know. The way our families are so similar, the way we met… it just doesn’t feel like coincidence. It’s like… there’s something that’s been set in motion, something we can’t control.”

Lily took his hand, her fingers warm against his, and gave it a reassuring squeeze. “Maybe we’re not supposed to know, not yet anyway,” she murmured, a trace of sadness woven through her words. “Maybe it’s one of those things that only makes sense when you look back, not while you’re living it. We just have to… trust that it’ll all come together someday.”

Jason held her gaze, feeling the weight of unspoken questions pressing between them. They were opposites in so many ways—her wild spontaneity, his careful logic; her impulsiveness, his grounded stability. And yet, they fit together in a way that felt like a long-lost balance, as if they were pieces of the same story that had finally found each other. Even as a sense of dread flickered at the edge of his thoughts, he pushed it aside, grounding himself in the warmth of her presence.

But as they sat there, surrounded by the quiet of the night, he couldn’t shake the feeling that they were caught in something far bigger than either of them could understand, their lives bound by invisible threads, tangled in ways they couldn’t yet see. He could almost sense the shape of something vast and intricate hovering just beyond their reach, a pattern woven into the fabric of their lives that defied the limits of logic and reason.

They both turned their gaze back to the city lights below, the night stretching out around them in a vast, quiet expanse. And as Jason sat there with her, hand in hand, he felt the thrill and weight of the unknown settle deep within him, a sense that they were teetering on the edge of something extraordinary.

 

\*\*\*\*\*\*

The Fortune Teller sat alone in her dimly lit room, the quiet hum of the fair long faded into memory. Her hands, weathered and steady, hovered over a shallow bowl filled with water that rippled with visions only she could see. In the shifting reflections, Jason and Lily’s faces appeared and vanished, two souls caught in an endless loop, bound by forces they could neither see nor understand.

She watched as they sat together on the hilltop, hands intertwined, their words and fears drifting out like whispers on the night air. The faintest smile touched her lips, but it was tinged with a deep sadness. She had seen it all before—their paths, their struggle, their connection stretching across worlds like threads in an intricate tapestry. And as much as she’d hoped to spare them the truth, the time had come to reveal what lay hidden.

“It is time,” she murmured, her voice a quiet echo that filled the stillness of her room. The words carried an undeniable weight, as if spoken not just by her, but by the very universe itself. She dipped a finger into the water, and the images of Jason and Lily dissolved into ripples, fading into darkness. Their journey would soon bring them to her door, seeking answers they could no longer deny.

But answers came with a price, and the Fortune Teller knew that the truth she held would unravel more than they could ever imagine. The echoes of thunder still rang faintly in her ears, a warning as old as the worlds themselves. And as she extinguished the candle beside her, plunging the room into shadow, she whispered a silent plea that, somehow, they might find a way to mend the rift.",1,1730487739.0,u_SirBigdog01,0,1.0,False

Background: 

I’m a 23 y/o male that has been working out 4-6 days a week for 8 years

I had a regular cup of coffee from home about 1.5-2 hours before going to the gym and I only had toast for breakfast, I don’t typically drink coffee and it does make me jittery sometimes but not always.

Story: 

I was working out at the gym back in August when near the end of my workout, as I was about to start the last set of my second last exercise, I suddenly felt my heart rate go through the roof, making a whole bunch of weird beats all over the place. I thought I was having a heart attack and almost asked the person next to me to call an ambulance lol. I stayed calm, breathed deeply, and called my mom to come pick me up. The episode lasted for about 5 or so before I slowly got up and anxiously walked to the door and sat in the lobby with my mom for a few minutes anxious to get up and walk to the car. I don’t remember feeling much more than the irregular heartbeat other than feeling anxious to standup and pass out if I were to walk out on my own.

I have never had this before and it hasn’t happened since. Only thing I’ve noticed is my heart skips a beat here and there, mostly when I’m tired or working out (I’ve been working out at my home gym ever since), which I believe is normal and I’ve noticed before. I have an Apple Watch now, and my ecg results are always sinus rhythm and my resting heart rate is between 40-80 (40 when I’m sleeping and between 70-80 when I’m active in the day).

I think I had a panic attack but Im curious to see if anyone thinks it could be something else? I read into ventricular tachycardia and the symptoms are seem similar which makes me nervous lol.

My doctor thinks it’s nothing and booked me a holter monitor appointment on Monday for 3 days for reassurance.

I’m asking about this now since I’m going to the police academy in 3 weeks and I’m feeling a it anxious about having an episode like that again while I’m there 😂.",1,1730487711.0,anxiety_support,1,1.0,False

Do you often find yourself dragging through the day, waiting for the next cup of coffee to kick in? You’re not alone! Many people struggle with energy levels, but the good news is that you can recharge your battery without relying solely on caffeine or energy drinks. In this post, we’ll explore five effective energy hacks that can help you feel revitalized, focused, and ready to tackle whatever comes your way!



# 1. Power Up with Proper Hydration

Did you know that even mild dehydration can lead to fatigue and decreased concentration? Water is essential for every cell in your body, and it plays a crucial role in maintaining energy levels. Aim to drink at least **8-10 cups of water daily**, and don’t wait until you feel thirsty!

**Hack**: Start your day with a glass of water first thing in the morning, and keep a water bottle handy throughout the day. You can even infuse your water with lemon, cucumber, or mint for a refreshing twist!



# 2. Move Your Body

When energy dips, a quick burst of physical activity can be incredibly effective. Exercise increases blood flow and releases endorphins, giving you a natural high that can last for hours.

**Hack**: Try a **5-minute movement break** every hour. This can be as simple as a few stretches, a brisk walk around the block, or a quick dance session to your favorite song. You'll return to your tasks feeling more alert and energized!



# 3. Optimize Your Sleep Environment

Quality sleep is crucial for maintaining high energy levels during the day. If you’re tossing and turning at night, it’s time to revamp your sleep environment.

**Hack**: Create a relaxing bedtime routine by dimming the lights an hour before bed, keeping your bedroom cool, and minimizing noise. Invest in blackout curtains and consider using a white noise machine if you live in a noisy area. Aim for **7-9 hours of quality sleep** each night to wake up refreshed.



# 4. Snack Smart

What you eat plays a significant role in your energy levels. Instead of reaching for sugary snacks that lead to crashes, opt for nutrient-dense foods that provide sustained energy.

**Hack**: Create your own energy-boosting snack packs! Combine nuts, seeds, and dried fruits for a balanced mix of healthy fats, protein, and fiber. Consider including snacks like Greek yogurt with honey, apple slices with almond butter, or veggies with hummus to keep your energy stable throughout the day.

# 5. Mindfulness and Breathing Exercises

Stress can drain your energy faster than anything else. Incorporating mindfulness practices into your routine can help you manage stress and recharge your mental batteries.

**Hack**: Take **3-5 minutes** each day to practice deep breathing or meditation. Find a quiet space, close your eyes, and focus on your breath. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a moment, then exhale slowly through your mouth. This simple practice can reduce anxiety and boost your focus.

# Conclusion: Take Control of Your Energy

Energy management doesn’t have to be complicated. By incorporating these simple hacks into your daily routine, you can experience a noticeable difference in your energy levels and overall well-being. Remember, small changes can lead to significant results!

It’s who will control the money and oil being supplied to the world. Killing Aaliyah’s father wasn’t in the plans. 

S1E8, Byron said, you had 20yrs to remove him from the list, if you didn’t want him dead. 

S1E8, Kaitlyn’s husband, Errol and Hollar, NSA director, both say the exact same thing. “… better to deal with the devil you know…”

The “money makers” and government insiders had control over who got what and unfortunately there was “collateral” damage but that was acceptable to them. 

Now, the “MM” don’t have that control, China is making a play and they need to get a handle on the situation. 

Eliminate China and get control of the Mexican oil cartel by showing them “we can get to anyone we want.”

So, the underlining plot for S2 is clean up the mess caused by the death of Aaliyah’s father and make sure the same mistake doesn’t happen again, not having control over the situation.

This means, kill the lioness program. 

Errol now knows he can’t influence Kaitlyn anymore and she’s been getting very suspicious of his comments. 
Kaitlyn would never let her lioness program get scrapped. 

Now, if we eliminated Joe or had leverage (kidnapping) over her the program is finished. Joe is not replaceable(in show context) and getting her classified info to obtain her address that is definitely leaked from the inside.

“MM” have the perfect smoke screen to blame Aaliyah’s family for retribution.

So, S3 would be find the mole and of course Joe survives and her family’s life is never the same.

(Gourmand/Coffee),"So, as a gourmand lover at heart, I always go for a coffee dominant vibe come colder months. The products I reach for during this time of year are usually as follows; 

***Haus Of Gloi*** pumpkin butter in **Vice**. But I find it can be rather intense at times so I’m hoping to try **Ghost Puffs** soon and that it’ll have a rice krispy treat vibe for me. I really am not wanting to smell like popcorn. 

A mix of ***LuvMilk’s*** **Child King** and **Cookie Thief** body spray on myself and clothes. Truly head over heels for these two, especially Child King. Absolutely devastated I must wait till winter for them lol 

Then **Strength** by ***Andromeda’s Curse*** on pulse points but it fades pretty quickly. 

My all time favorite indie to use year around is **Delizia Di Marshmallow** by ***Kyse***. I’m utterly obsessed with a realistic marshmallow straight from the bag scent and this has been the closest I’ve found. But I’ve never tried CocoaPink’s marshmallow outside of Rice Krispy Treat and I’m curious! 

I’m excited to dive into the Black Friday sale tomorrow but am feeling really overwhelmed by the huge selection. I’m interested in any scent you think could combine/layer well with the others or that I might be interested in? I’m open to trying something, not necessarily coffee related, but that could layer well and create an interesting or complex vibe/atmosphere with the others. I’m planning on getting linen sprays and possibly the silky soft body oil if that helps at all. 

*The scents I’ve personally been eyeing are…*

- Black Cherry Upside Down Cake
- Black Marshmallow
- Butterscotch Marshmallow Frosting
- Full Moon
- Hazelnut Napoleon 
- Hearts on Fire Gelato
- Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream
- Marshmallow 
- Mocha Ice Cream Sundae
- Myrrh Coffee
- Pumpkin Waffle Delight
- White Chocolate Covered Pretzels
- Wynken, Blynken & Nod

*But I’m totally open!*

Sorry for rambling! Any reviews or recommendations would be thoroughly appreciated! Happy shopping season y’all :)

1ghcqhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1ghcqhn/can_you_feel_lonely_but_still_have_friends/,Can you feel lonely but still have friends?,"I’m a 2nd year undergrad and I just recently moved to a new school, abroad and away from my closest friends of 15 years. My uni friends (different from my closest friends) also moved to the same school I went to. I also stay in a dorm and get to go home during the weekends.

I dont know what this is, but ever since i started uni, I started to feel very alone. My closest friends used to be my whole world. We would talk about everything and anything, share all our stories/experiences. But when i moved away, we dont get to talk that much (understandably) and I came to terms with that already.

I figured that this would be a way for growth as I would branch out and strengthen the bond with my uni friends and get to know my roommates more. For the past few months, I did try to get along with them, but they seem to each have chosen their “person”. Like they seem to have chosen the person they would open up to, the person to accompany them somewhere, or ask for help. It’s like im the least important friend. And It’s not on purpose either, they did become friends first and I came on a bit later, but because of that, theres like this wall formed already. 

Nevertheless, I chose to overlook that and start to bond with them more. However, i recently started to notice that i’m not sure i could ever be close with them. Their interests and personalities are way too different from mine and I know that having differences doesn’t mean you cant be friends, but I have it hard to relate with them. 

On the other hand, i thought i would really get along with my roommates, and I do, but It’s a similar situation with my uni friends, different personalities and interests.

And the situation that really got me thinking that I was alone was when my closest friends invited me out to coffee and the whole gang was there + their significant other (s/o).

They seemed to be very secure in life, in a sense that they have someone to turn to and lean on in times of happiness, sadness, etc. Something you might not be able to get from friendships alone.

And, i think It’s because of all of these events happening in succession that really made me feel lonely. 

Im not at that phase of my life where im ready to be in a relationship and i thought i was fine that way but with most of the people i know being in one, I cant help but feel like im missing out on something even though I know that we all have our own pacing in life. I dont have anyone to depend on anymore or to open up to.

15 years of relationship, 6 years married.

Back in my country, I was independent, and in my age (just sub 30) I was in the top 1% earners, half way through second law degree and had my own consulting business working 30 hour weeks. Life was good.

We got married. I got pregnant right away. Still worked, still studied. Then he decided to leave his job and look for work I another country. 

So we moved. Second kid. Pandemic. I was isolated. Our sex life ended the minute I got pregnant with the first kid. After second, who is now 3, I'm pretty sure it's less than 1x a year. 

I did tell him right then that making an international move on that situation, me giving up so much, leaving family, small kid, foreign country, we'll need to have each other's back. It will be hard.

Oh well. I was so alone. He would come home with a smirk on his face. The minute the kids take a nap or go to sleep, he is sleeping or at his computer. All financial matters? He decides without even bothering to tell me, because it's 'his money"". Every feeling I had was invalidated. Made fun of my looks. Of my intelligence. Work. Called me a bad mother. 

I did get a job (after he called me unemployable during my search), but it's a consulting role, with that comes half the check and no benefits. We are in an expensive urban area. 

In the five years, I could visit my country once. I didn't have the means, and he didn't have the will. My children are forgetting the language. 

Every dream I have is invalidated. He chooses the country, the house, the car. The childcare. Buys the groceries, but has very low standards for what's healthy, and I'm giving up one battle after another, because I could say a million times something isn't good for the kids, he will say ok, continue buying it, and call me crazy and ""what are you talking about"" when I bubble over.  

Feel depressed? Then I'm crazy and just need to take some pills. 

The newest one, he takes 75 grand equity loan on the house (that he overpaid for to begin with, but my input didn't matter). He doesn't tell me about it, but needs my signature. So he asks the banker to come to our house, makes sure I'm there for the appointment, and just asks me to sign it, saying it's none of the banker's business to ask what the cash is for. It's been a few months and I still don't know. Yes, we never merged finances, despite me asking that we do. And yes, when I was with kids, without the legal means to work, in a foreign country so that he could pursue his career however he saw fit, I'd be scolded for buying a bottle of coke for myself on the way to a playground.

I assume once I got pregnant and gave up what I've built back home, it became a power trip for him. He was pulling all the strings, and I was no one. Hell, looking back, even our wedding was all about what he wanted.

Yet, he is not evil. He isn't hurting me physically, just ignores every need and wish and desire. I'm in my late thirties and spend the past decade in a loveless, sexless relationship. He pays the bills, feeds the kids, cleans. Still makes me a coffee in the morning. But that's that. Wouldn't take the kiddos camping. Hates to go to the beach. Asking him to go with us on a hike is a multi-month endeavour. 

He flat our refused therapy, telling me to put my stuff in trash bags and leave if I'm not happy. Then recently, I was on the verge of going, he asked me to stay and that he'd agree to therapy. Which was an absolute disaster - he'd see the person for 6 months on his own and then the first session was essentially framing me as total evil and him being the perfect, open, communicating counterpart. I refused to see the therapist ever again, because she wouldn't even ask my input and validate a lot of the emotional abuse. And that was that.

The kids love the neighborhood. We have amazing people all around. I have a job that could lead to being completely amazing if it becomes a staff contract. I love the garden and have put a lot of work into it, planting trees with my kids. Yet, I don't want my kids to continue seeing this. This isn't family, it's not love, it's not companionship. 

I'm terrified of leaving. This is a foreign country, different legal system, and Im holding the shorter end of the stick. I can't afford the mortgage on the house on my own, and even if I somehow could, I'm commuting far (Hours. Undoable as a single parent. Another one if his choices - he doesn't have to commute, so it didn't matter that my most likely job option would be in the city). So for me, divorcing means pack up, rent a tiny apartment, leave my indifferent husband to hang out out in a million dollar house, take the children away from their fun filled backyard and friends, the schools, and take over every aspect of mine and the kids lives, on 1/3rd the income.  

With how he treats the finances and mortgage and all, I may end up getting nothing. And yes, I'm also mad at myself, because I've had it all until he walked over everything I've built and put his desires first. And in I f* listened.

Help me get the courage to end this. I don't want to turn into an old grumpy woman because I wasted my life away, and I'm absolutely positive that if I don't do anything, that's how it will turn out.

I voiced my concerns to Laura, but she brushed them off, saying they were in love and everything would be fine.

The day after they announced the move, I ran into Tom at a coffee shop. He looked a bit stressed, so I asked him how he felt about the upcoming changes. He opened up about some worries he had regarding the transition, and in a moment of honesty, I told him I thought it might be too soon for them to rush into living together. I mentioned that living together can be a big adjustment and that it might be worth considering if they were both ready for that level of commitment.

Tom seemed taken aback and thanked me for my honesty, but I could tell I had struck a nerve. Later that day, Laura called me fuming, saying I had overstepped and put doubt in Tom’s mind. She said I should have kept my opinions to myself, especially since it’s their relationship and their choice.

Now I’m torn. I genuinely care about both of them and just wanted to express my concerns because I’ve seen how moving in together can change dynamics, sometimes for the worse. AITA for speaking my mind to Tom, or should I have stayed out of it and let them figure it out on their own?",1,1730486060.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

1ghcewr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/1ghcewr/finally_getting_my_first_cpap_machine/,Finally getting my first CPAP machine,"So I finally bought it. I have had ZERO energy for so many years now that I had decided to pull the trigger.

I tried everything, hoping it's not sleep apnea that is causing it. Many cans of energy drinks a day, methylphenidate 30mg CR in the morning + 10mg in the middle of the day, losing weight, exercise (boxing, out of all things).

But moving 40cm (like almost 16 inches?) to the right is too much to ask for. It's too much work to clean up my office, too much work to get up and close the door, too much work to grind coffee beans. I can even fall asleep immediately after drinking four 500ml (0.5 gallons total?) cans of Monster.

And all of that on a high dose of a stimulant that works similarly to amphentamines (previously mentioned methylphenidate).

Insane.

I guess I shouldn't have ignored all these years where I felt like my throat is closing when being on the edge of falling asleep. Probably shouldn't have ignored my friend's comment that he will never sleep at my place again because I snore so loud that he can't sleep. I probably shouldn't have ignored my heart suddenly beating like crazy out of nowhere when lying in bed.

Definitely couldn't ignore last 2 weeks where it would happen multiple times per night, exactly every night. The feeling like you're slowly squeezing your heart and preventing it from beating shoud've motivated me to finally consider to buy the damn thing.

I kinda wish I checked this subreddit earlier as well. It seems like I have an extreme version of sleep apnea, seeing how most people here who do have it report symptoms that aren't very close in severity to what I have. It seems like for most people sleep apnea is not even consciously detectable, it's only derived as a conclusion from all the effects it causes during the day. Only then people decide to go for a check up.

I actually can feel my airway being physically closed during those episodes. I can also reproduce it immediately when relaxing all my muscles. It seems like the natural position for my airways is the closed position.

Yikes.

Well, hopefully this will change my life at least a little bit.

Sorry for the wall of text, just wanted to share some of my experiences.

A friendship would be better than nothing, I do love our conversations. You left me on read, so clearly my answer was wrong.

You have someone you love. I hope she makes you happy, you deserve that.
With her in mind it didn't feel right dumping all of this this on you. What I really wanted to tell you were that I wished our timing (or mine..) would have been better. I wanted to tell you I miss you. After all these years I still miss you. Is that stupid? Oh yes. I should have forgotten about us. We were never really a thing anyway. Is it crazy? Absolutely, I never claimed to be sane. Nonetheless, it is what it is. I want us to try.

I want to go on dates with you. Go to restaurants, cafés and pubs. I want us to share meals, coffees and pints. Stolen glances over the cups, smiles and conversations. I want us to get to know the people we have become and grow together. I want to know whether you still play the guitar and what music you listen to now. I want to know the books you are reading and which movies you like. I want us to share thoughts and feelings, joys and fears. I want you to trust me again and for you show me the depths of you affection. I want to show you I am worthy of your trust and I want us to be vulnerable and show our true colors.

You told me you missed the nature back home - I want us to go for walks. Hiking in the mountains and the woods. I want to stroll the city with you, I want to people watch and laugh while making up their stories. I want us to go shopping, I want us to cook and clean. I want us to share our ups and downs and support eachother through it all.

I want us to hold hands and I want us to hug. I want to feel the safety and warmth of your embrace. I want to feel your breath on my skin and the excitement of what's to come. I want us to kiss and make out. I want to know every inch of you and for you to know every inch of me.

When I tell them I physically can't stop napping and it's torture to resist they say ""drink coffee."" My life is falling apart.","Mid 30s F, BMI 20. Diagnosed mild sleep apnea (AHI 13) and delayed sleep phase disorder. I've had an overnight sleep study but not a MSLT. Had a titration study for CPAP which failed due to TECSAs. 

Doctor didn't think I should bother with PAP therapy despite the apnea, said it's mild when on my side so I should just learn to sleep on my side. And for the delayed sleep phase, I should just go to bed at 9pm, wake up earlier, and stop napping. Her response to me saying that's impossible for me is in the title, ""drink more caffeine"" - caffeine doesn't wake me up, 1 cup of tea or coffee does nothing at all, and if I have more than that it just upsets my stomach and gives me diarrhea and if anything makes me more tired. 

I had to push to try PAP therapy for the apnea. My dr hasn't bothered to make it easy for me I guess since she didn't think I should do it. It's been a bureaucratic nightmare. Took 2 months to even get one (in part because she ""forgot"" to upload the prescription for several weeks) and I've been trying it for a month and I think I just completely cannot tolerate it. The pressures required to treat my apnea are genuinely intolerably painful. 

Oh, and my doctor also seemed to get annoyed when I told her I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and I'm trying stimulants for that. She asked if I even wanted to carry on with the sleep stuff or if I was just interested in ADHD now. I burst into tears on on video call, so frustrated and tired and overwhelmed, tearfully justifying that I'm desperate to resolve whatever my sleep issue is. So then she decided I'm just depressed. 

If one more doctor dismisses me as just being anxious or depressed I'm going to light myself on fire in their waiting room. 

I'm on temporary disability from work right now. But I feel hopeless. I'm massively burning out. I've been excessively fatigued since I was a prepubescent child & started asking doctors about it at age 15, I'm mid 30s now and only got a sleep study this year, so 20 years later. 

It just feels like no doctor will ever care, no help is coming, I will eventually lose my job, I'll lose my house, I won't be able to afford to live.

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I’ve mentioned in my post, it’s up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on “hey” or smalltalk responses.

Amsterdam is a city known for its cycling culture, and when fall rolls in, it transforms into a dreamland for solo travelers looking to explore on two wheels. With leaves turning golden and canals reflecting the warm hues of autumn, there’s no better way to enjoy the city than by biking through its scenic routes. Whether you’re a seasoned cyclist or just love leisurely rides, Amsterdam in fall offers the perfect escape for solo nomads seeking adventure and tranquility.

In this guide, we’ll explore some of the best fall biking routes for solo travelers, top spots to stop for a coffee or a photo, and tips to make the most of your autumn cycling experience in the city.

# Why Fall is the Best Time to Bike in Amsterdam

Fall in Amsterdam brings cooler temperatures and fewer tourists, making it an ideal time for solo travelers to bike around the city. The streets are quieter, the parks are ablaze with fall colors, and the crisp air makes cycling even more enjoyable.

# Key Benefits of Biking in Amsterdam During Fall:

**Breathtaking Fall Foliage:** Amsterdam’s parks and canals are lined with trees that turn gold and red, creating a picturesque backdrop for your ride.

**Less Crowded:** Summer crowds have subsided, giving you more space to navigate the bike paths and explore at your own pace.

**Perfect Cycling Weather:** Fall in Amsterdam is cool but not too cold, making it the perfect weather for an extended bike ride.

# Top Fall Biking Routes for Solo Nomads

# 1. Vondelpark: A Relaxing Ride Through Nature

Vondelpark is the place to be if you're looking for a serene ride in the middle of nature. This large public park is located in the heart of Amsterdam and offers tree-lined paths, serene lakes, and plenty of spots to stop for a quick rest.

**Why It’s Perfect:** The park’s vibrant fall colors and calm atmosphere make it a top destination for solo travelers.

**What to Do:** Pack a snack, find a cozy bench, and enjoy the autumn views, or visit one of the park’s cafes for a warm drink.

**Pro Tip:** For more information on cycling routes within Vondelpark.

# 2. Amsterdamse Bos: Explore a Hidden Gem

For a longer ride, head to the Amsterdamse Bos, a man-made forest just outside the city. This expansive park is a favorite among locals and offers miles of scenic cycling trails through woodlands, lakes, and open meadows. In the fall, the Bos is particularly beautiful, with trees shedding their leaves in shades of gold and amber.

**Why It’s Perfect:** It’s quiet, less touristy, and offers plenty of room for solo bikers to enjoy nature in peace.

**What to Do:** Take a break at one of the park’s picturesque lakes or stop by the goat farm for some fresh cheese.

**Pro Tip:** If you’re feeling adventurous, consider a bike ride out to the nearby villages of Amstelveen or Ouderkerk aan de Amstel.

# 3. Canal Belt: A Classic Amsterdam Experience

Amsterdam’s Canal Belt (Grachtengordel) is arguably the city’s most iconic area, and there’s no better way to explore it than by bike. The vibrant colors of fall will frame the cute houseboats, bridges, and buildings that are hundreds of years old as you ride your bike along the historic canals.

**Why It’s Perfect:** The Canal Belt offers the quintessential Amsterdam experience, perfect for solo riders looking to soak in the city’s culture.

**What to Do:** Stop at a cozy café along the canal for a cup of coffee, or take a quick photo by one of the iconic canal bridges.

**Pro Tip:** Early mornings or late afternoons are the best times to ride through the Canal Belt, as the light is soft and the streets are quieter. [Click here to plan your route through the Canal Belt](https://heylink.me/tunextravels/).

# 4. Oosterdok: Biking with a Waterfront View

For those who love waterfront views, the Oosterdok route offers a perfect blend of city sights and open waters. This biking route takes you through the Eastern Docklands, an area known for its modern architecture and sweeping views of the IJ River.

**Why It’s Perfect:** The mix of old and new Amsterdam, along with the stunning water views, makes this a unique and scenic ride.

**What to Do:** Stop by the Nemo Science Museum rooftop for panoramic views of the city or visit the nearby Maritime Museum.

**Pro Tip:** End your ride at Java Island for one of the best sunset views over the city.

# Essential Tips for Solo Bikers in Amsterdam

**Stay on the Bike Lanes:** Amsterdam is a bike-friendly city, but it’s important to always stay in designated bike lanes to avoid pedestrian traffic.

**Mind the Weather:** Fall can be unpredictable, so bring a light rain jacket just in case. The good news is that Amsterdam is still beautiful even under a light drizzle!

**Use a Sturdy Lock:** Bike theft can be an issue in Amsterdam, so make sure to lock your bike securely when making stops.

# Where to Rent a Bike in Amsterdam

There are plenty of bike rental shops scattered across Amsterdam, making it easy to rent a bike for a few hours or the entire day. Popular rental companies include MacBike and A-Bike. Many rental shops also offer guided bike tours if you’re looking to explore the city with a local expert.

**Pro Tip:** Some bike rental companies offer discounts for solo travelers.

# Final Thoughts: Enjoying Amsterdam on Two Wheels

Biking through Amsterdam in the fall is a truly magical experience, especially for solo travelers who love to explore at their own pace. Whether you’re cycling through the vibrant streets of the Canal Belt, enjoying the peaceful paths of Vondelpark, or taking in the waterfront views at Oosterdok, you’re sure to fall in love with the city and its autumn charm.

Hi everyone! I could really use some advice on picking a dining table and coffee table for my space. I’ll attach a picture of the room layout. Right now, there’s a white round table in the space, but I’m not loving it and plan to return it.

Any recommendations for the best shape, size, or color that would work well here? Thanks so much in advance for your help!",2,1730485351.0,HomeDecorating,0,1.0,False
1ghc6hr,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ghc6hr/i_dont_like_today/,I don’t like today ,"Woke up, the puppy that still needs to be crated overnight had broken out of the crate, peed and pooped in her room as well as destroyed some non replaceable items. Cool. Took the dogs out, cleaned up the mess, got to make coffee. 

Fast forward a few hours, errands done, I go to feed the chickens and pigs some fruit that was turning yuck. The rooster decides he’s going to pick a fight with me today, giving me a nice gash on my thigh. A shovel was my nearest weapon so I showed him he’s not the boss of me. He’s just fine, I didn’t hurt him, but had to put my dick out for that little shit. Ok. Eat lunch. Take shower to clean the rooster talon shit out of my leg. 

Get out of the shower and the deaf and good dog is eating the trash. Super. Awesome. He’s always the best, I never have to reprimand him. Just had to sit down and let out a good cry. 

What I think is the amazing is that, at 507 days sober, I’m not at all thinking a drink will fix my day. I know I just need to calm down, take some good breaths, and take steps to hopefully make the rest of the day more chill. There’s absolutely no way having a drink will make anything better, today or any other day. I just wanted to share this with the people that would understand.

1ghc3hy,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1ghc3hy/my_thoughts_on_18_scents_from_bpals/,My thoughts on 18 scents from BPAL's Autumn/Halloween 2024 release,"I always spend the whole month of October writing reviews for a bevy of BPAL scents, which usually culminates in a massive blog post on Halloween. I've been doing this for over a decade now and it's one of my favorite annual rituals! Here are my thoughts on all the ones I tried this year

**Moroccan Pumpkin** (*pumpkin spices wind through a blend of warm musk, carnation, red sandalwood and cassia*) Immensely slatherable, an oozing study in autumnal comfort, heavy and sweet on the skin. The pumpkin note is rich and velvety, with a buttery smoothness that goes beyond coating the back of a spoon...I think the spoon would stand straight up in this if it were an actual edible thing! Spices add depth and complexity - warm cinnamon and golden, resinous amber - their heat tempered by the syrupy sweetness of brown sugar crystals seemingly dissolving into the blend. There's a thickness to this scent, almost tactile in its presence, like the last spoonful of preserves clinging to the jar. It's a scent that embodies the season's most indulgent desserts - think slices of custardy pumpkin pie topped with dollops of whipped cream, warm cinnamon rolls dripping with gooey icing, and sticky toffee pudding saturated with a rich maple butterscotch sauce.

**Darling, Darling** (*sugared pear and wild violets with orris butter, coconut milk, white musk, and vanilla silk*) opens with a creamy, candied tartness that swoons into a misty moody, melancholic violet - a fevered vision nestled in the heart of a midnight reverie. This is a sugar-frosted  bloom with a nocturnal appetite - powdery yet sharp, a strange, romantic sweetness on which one feeds exclusively and voraciously. A velvety richness mingles with a subtle lactonic note, providing a silky backdrop that amplifies the scent's confectionery nature. A diaphanous veil of clean musk intertwines with gossamer-light vanilla, forming an ethereal shroud of tender menace clinging to trembling skin. TLDR; imagine a succubus feeding you Smarties.

**Dead Leaves, Incense Smoke & Oud** Imagine you are Mazzy Star circa 1993, but you are also slowly being consumed by the trees. Damp, earthy autumn leaves whisper songs of decay, a slow plume of incense smoke hangs low on the breeze, and the sun drops below the bloody, burning horizon. Rich woody darkness, a tree's shadowy heart, and you, a pile of dust, an endlessly fading chord.

**Dead Leaves, Black Tea & Bergamot** The earthy, euphoric scent of autumn rises from a carpet of fallen leaves, their colors a blanket of umber and gold spread beneath rusted wrought-iron gates. Wisps of aromatic steam curl from an abandoned mug on a weathered stone bench, mingling with the garden's fading sighs. At twilight, a crisp breeze rattles the trees, carrying a jolly, vegetal brightness that disperses the melancholy haze like a peal of laughter at an unexpectedly inappropriate joke! A moment, a reflective pause between seasons, rich with the comforting warmth of autumn and the lingering mischief of the departing summer, the last chirp of a cricket giving way to the first croak of an autumn toad.

**The Bell Witch** (*rusted iron, mandrake root, burnt vetiver, and patchouli leaves*) What is it about the human heart that loves a place forsaken? In a forgotten corner of an abandoned homestead, weathered tools rest against crumbling walls, once-gleaming surfaces now a canvas of rust and patina, shadows pool in the pitted surface of an old axe head. From between warped floorboards, gnarled tendrils reach upward, twisted and pale, insistently seeking.  A tenebrous botanical scent rises with them, vegetal and searching. It mingles with the musty air, a complex perfume of damp wood, old leather, and the faint memory of smoke. Dust hangs suspended in slanted beams of light; each mote a silent witness to creeping decay and desolation.

**Black Lipstick** (*waxy drugstore lipstick and clove cig residue*) Velvety pigments and wine-darkened lips, inky midnight fruits, rich, jammy, plummy, plush malaise-as-a-lifestyle-choice kisses. 

**Pumpkin Musk & Black Oud** Pureed gourd flesh and nutty, toasted grains steep in dusky, caramelized sweetness. A slice of pumpkin bread devoured at a forsaken crossroads, where a witching-hour deal is yet to be struck.

**The Fading Crimson of the Sky** (*bergamot shuddering through lime leaves, ruby-tinged amber sunlight, violet leaf, oak bark, and sandalwood smoke*) An unsettling missive scrawled in smoke; the honeyed light and amber glow of a strangely flickering twilight; a slice of citrus wrapped in lace, pale jade juice seeping into the threads. The pearlescent moon rises, and violet-tinged shadows writhe over a hushed glade.

**Dry Ice Cocktail** (*a sparkling absinthe martini swirled with a glow stick and overflowing with cascades of dry ice fog*) A spectral chill in frosted glass; anise and verbena spark with eerie luminescence. Icy tendrils spill over the rim, a fog that bites at curious fingers. The elixir shimmers with cold vapor suspended between tipple and mist - green herbal shivers and sharp, aromatic secrets swirling in misty limbo.

**The Autumn People** (*hay-dusted oak, honey mead, pumpkin rind, vetiver root, corn husk, and maple leaves*) An unexpected autumnal breeze; crisp leaves carry secrets of golden fields. Honey-tinged sunlight clings to weathered bark, earthy roots anchor fleeting warmth. Tattered pumpkin rind scrapings compost with the sweet decay of fallen foliage. Deceptively fresh, almost cheerful, yet a ghostly chorus lingers in wind-stirred branches - a chill, whistling echo of summer's fading warmth.

**The Ruins of Karnstein** (*the rich, earthy depth of oud, vetiver, and moss, grounded in the untamed wilds of the forest, echoing the ancient stones that remain*) Monstrous vegetation breathes a verdant miasma, its exhalations heavy with the weight of countless eons. In the same space, the same breath, the other eye observes a study in boreal archaeology: a drift of dead branches, ancient pine cones, desiccated moss. Tendrils of primordial green intertwine with crumbling stone, suspended in time. Undergrowth, thicket, and canopy exude a vast murky viridescence, revealing a mirror world where forest and ruin reflect endlessly, an unsettling symmetry of growth and decay.

**Pumpkin Spice Halo-Halo** (*ube halaya and ube ice cream chonked with mango jelly, flan, boiled taro, evaporated milk, sweetened kidney beans, dried coconut, kaong, gulaman, tapioca pearls, and a copious shake of pumpkin spice*) This is a very creamy blend, but also very ...earthy? Velvety ribbons of milky jam weave through wobbling mounds of coconut custard. Lumpy dollops of an almost figgy milk jelly jostle jiggingly aside pillowy palm sugar flan. But there is also the starchy nectar of sweet rice, beans boiled in fruit syrup, and the subterranean, geosmic sweetness of mashed tubers. This fragrance has all of those things...plus a tiny spoonful of salty, nutty, browned butter.

**Traditional Sheet Ghost** (*cool white cotton, marshmallow fluff, and lemony Oman frankincense*) A farmers market fruit basket tumbles into the washing machine, emerges an olfactory apparition. High-thread-count luxury cotton sheets, spin cycle séance, rustling with tales of anemic fruits transfused with linen-fresh detergent. Bedclothes drift through air heavy with warm humidity and the powdery tang of fabric softener, an olfactory bedtime story of fruits gently haunting your freshly laundered linens.

**Datura Blossom** This impression of chlorinated florals, aquatic honey, and a slight mineral effervescence is not at all what I expected… although I think this is going to be a summertime favorite! . This is a midsummer fever dream, foamed with flowers, pearled with light. Narcotic petals lounging poolside: honey-sweet poisonous blooms take a dip in cerulean waters at high noon in mid-July, and they’re floating on neon pool noodles and drinking slightly flat but icy-cold Topo Chico. For those who appreciate such things, this one reminds me a bit of the long-discontinued Danube.

**Hollow Hallow** (a suffocating pumpkin kyphi soaked in dark red wine and darkened by vetiver, opoponax, and black oud) The pores of the earth yawn open, exuding an inky miasma perfumed with earthy autumnal spices and sweet brown sugar musk. This glazed, glistening cascade of aromatic sap gleams under a harvest moon, a glossy pool of honeyed incense golden and thick, an aromatic oil slick of resinous warmth and syrupy darkness. From the viscous depths, a pumpkin-headed silhouette emerges, its hollow eyes glowing with ancient malice—an old god awakening to reclaim its hallowed home.

**The Great and Titled Dead** (the haunted stillness of a long-decayed cemetery plot choked by ivy and wild blackberry thorns) Did I hear a blackberry giggle? And why did it sound so chilling, soulless, and evil? A chorus of tiny, wicked voices rises from the brambles, their sweet menace carried on a gentle breeze. The scent drifts lightly, deceptively airy, its delicate touch belying the weight of ancient malice it carries.

**Tropical Print Sheet Ghost** (cascades of banana Leaf, bamboo fiber, mango, papaya, and hibiscus, streaked with ectoplasm and sticky tears of strelitzia sap) I always list the notes with these reviews because sometimes I forget myself and get lost in impressions or dreams or memories or go off on labyrinthine tangents that stray very far from perfumereviewlandia. In this case, it is helpful to share the perfumer’s notes because I am going to list a very different set of smeller’s notes: honeydew, rhubarb, & honeysuckle preserves, a translucent shiver of ginger leaf, a rosebud preening, its reflection glassy and cool in a pool of still rainwater. Fresh, clear nectar, lush and swirling in a prismatic jelly jar, balancing on a small tray carved of young, green wood.

**Pumpkin Latte** (espresso, pumpkin syrup, smoky vanilla bean, milk, raw sugar, and a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg) I don’t know how I’ve been reviewing these Halloween scents for so long, and yet I have never talked about this one. Perhaps it’s because it’s been lurking in the shadows, biding its time, waiting for the perfect moment to reveal its true nature. And that nature? It’s not what you’d expect. The coffee is strong and smoky, a dark roast rebellion against the expected sweetness. This is not the sticky-sweet pumpkin syrup bomb of your coffee-chain drive-thru order with your name spelled ridiculously wrong (ugh, poor “Keighleigh”). Instead, imagine a barista witch concocting a potion of bitter mysteries and autumnal secrets in a cauldron of burnished copper. Vanilla bean smoke curls around the edges, more felt than tasted, while cinnamon and nutmeg whisper spicy nothings from the shadows. A ribbon of milk weaves through it all, not to soften but to complicate – binding the realms of wake and sleep, summer’s fading warmth, and winter’s approaching chill. Raw sugar lingers as an afterthought, crunching softly like leaves underfoot or the last grains of sand in October’s hourglass. This is a PSL for those who find comfort in decay and seek beauty in the turn of seasons – a not-too-sweet (ultimate compliment) toast to endings that taste like new beginnings.",9,1730485135.0,fragrance,2,0.92,False

1ghc1gu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1ghc1gu/strongly_disagree_with_dr_becky_on_making_kids/,"Strongly disagree with Dr. Becky on making kids say ""thank you""","I've seen videos of Dr. Becky telling parents that they shouldn't make their children say ""thank you"" because it's inauthentic, and instead they should encourage children to feel gratitude, which will ultimately result in children saying thank you spontaneously. 

Am I the only one who is totally opposed to this? To me, the point isn't to feel gratitude when you are saying thank you - I personally don't always even feel grateful when I say thank you as an adult! The point is that the person who has done the nice thing hears that they are being thanked in the moment, and is recognized for the thoughtful thing they've done. In other words, it's not about me, it's about you. Do I always feel super thankful when a barista calls my name and I go to the counter to pick up my coffee? Sometimes I'm scatterbrained and thinking about my to do list, or I'm feeling rushed and anxious for work, so no, I do not actively feel thankful in that moment! However, I know it's important for that worker to hear ""thank you"" in that moment and to feel recognized for what they've done. It feels so wrong to not thank someone in the moment just because I'm not particularly feeling it. 

I don't know why, but Dr. Becky's words really got under my skin and made me angry. Perhaps it's because I've been in service jobs and in other situations in life where I was working hard for other people, and every single little ""thank you"" meant something to me, even if it was delivered as an afterthought. I would be curious to know of other people agree or disagree here. 

For what it's worth, I think ""please say thank you to this person for the nice thing they've done for you"" is totally okay to say to children. I would probably not want to yell it at them or anything, but I don't think it's shaming/unreasonable.",462,1730484986.0,Parenting,201,0.95,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

**Who is CB?**

CB is a TikToker from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Her content focuses on her day to day life with her kids, cooking, crafting, dating as a single Mom and **drama**. She initially started her TikTok account during the COVID-19 pandemic where she eventually amassed a following of 260,000. It is speculated that her first viral video was the “Oil Guy Saga” (which will be covered in this series at a later time).

She has had multiple TikTok accounts (about 3 accounts) and aliases during her stint on TikTok but her current account was created June 2023 and the majority of the following information will be from this time period.

**What is the intention of this document?**

The intention of this document is to compile information and evidence in order to dispel rumours and misinformation. We as a collective do not wish to present a biased opinion, rather we wish to lay out all of the evidence from both sides so that you may come to your own conclusion. We have found that C has shown that she isn’t completely forthcoming with the things she has shared as she tends to show one side of the story or a slightly skewed version of the other parties story. We hope that this collected evidence gives you a better understanding of what has been presented to you.

**What is Dry Begging and what is E-Begging?**

**Dry begging** is a slang term that is used to describe the act of obtaining something by asking for it indirectly or vaguely.

**E-Begging** (also known as internet begging, cyber begging, or internet panhandiling) is an online version of traditional begging, asking strangers for money with little or no benefit to the strangers paying.

You may have seen quite a few TikTok accounts that follow this E-Begging trend where users are begging their viewers for cash to help fund a variety of needs and wants: from paying off credit card bills to buying coffee. These hopeful beggars tend to ask for a dollar from each viewer which might not seem like much but with a sizeable audience it can be lucrative. This linked Indy100 article \[[https://www.indy100.com/tiktok/tiktok-begging-trend-reaction](https://www.indy100.com/tiktok/tiktok-begging-trend-reaction)\] from January 2023 speaks about this trend but also mentions an important observation: 

*“Many people have gotten tired of this trend saying that most people asking for money are probably spending it on just whatever they want and not what they say they are going to spend it on.”*

\-Noah Glenn Carter

 Scammers use psychological manipulation to build online relationships with victims to eventually extract money through sob stories, romance scams, and fake emergencies. Be aware.



[A reddit thread discussing the magnitude of TikTok begging](https://preview.redd.it/isg8emmgubyd1.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=778d0b53bbc9cd74ee75c1095df230d2859acb0b)

 

# 🚩What can you do to protect yourself as a Follower?🚩

It seems very obvious, but be mindful of creators that ask you for money either directly or indirectly. A creator does not have to flat out ask you to pay their bills but subtle hints that involve buying something from them or gifting objects to them should be a cause for concern. Other subtle hints you should be cautious of is the use of sob stories where they are the perpetual victim.

**""But no one is forcing me to buy things from them or gift to these creators!!!!""**  
This is true! and people do fall on hard times but if these creators are constantly falling on hard times over and over for years your donations aren't actually helping them get ahead in life.

**""I want to help a creator out financially, how can I do it safely?""**  
So you want to help a stranger on the internet....please know that these people curate an online persona in order to amass the following that they do. You don't truly know someone you've never met in person.

**But.**

If you are certain that you want to help this person with their bills please inform the creator that you would like to get a hold of their landlord or housing agent in order to setup a payment. If the creator does not agree to do this or makes excuses as to why they can't get you in contact with these individuals then that is a red flag. 🚩

If you are willing to pay their phone bill/car payments/vet bill etc. please get a hold of these individuals as they can prove the exact amount that the creator owes.

**""What if the creator asks me to send them money via e-transfer/venmo/paypal?""**

Be aware that payments made in this manner are risky as you are not protected in the chance that you were defrauded. Once the money is deposited in someone elses account you will not be able to receive your money back.

This is especially concerning if you are sending a creator money in exchange for an item they are selling and you in fact never did recieve your item. You are not protected by your bank/money transfer platform and the creator has zero obligation to refund you. They may even block you when you begin to question them. 🚩

Maybe it will help some others.,"I know that Bipolar 1 is supposed to have ""less severe"" depression but it's always been bad for me and my father. I barely crawl out through depression every single time. I'm used to handling mania--be productive without burning yourself out, force yourself to take care of yourself, isolate if you get too jumpy, take your meds. As good as it gets as long as I follow every step. But depression feels more like a mystery. There's this voice in my head that only speaks when depression is coming, his voice calm and clear, and he wants to destroy me slowly for two months until it's time for him to go temporarily.

But this time, I'll fight back. I wrote this huge word document for myself and I've been reading it over and over to get through this. I hope this helps people. Maybe. Maybe there are people like me out there who can benefit from this.

  
The document:

  
Look, I know you have been going back and forth in this Bipolar rollercoaster as if there’s no hope. You wished for a “solution” once. I will give you one. Too-fucking-bad that we don’t always get miracle solutions on a silver plate, so I made you a list to get your shit together like a soldier.

I will be gentle but harsh, like a military buddy.

Oyster, this Bipolar shit is no news. You’ve had it since you were very young, so stop acting like it’s a new disaster. You’ve had it, but you weren’t diagnosed yet. You weren’t medicated either. If you survived SEVEN formative years of fluctuations on the paranoid-suicidal scale, then you surely will survive this shit with your fucking meds.

Keep taking your fucking meds. “But I don’t want to be nauseous!” my ass. Miss the fucking meds and you’ll forget to eat for a whole day, get weirdass nightmares, and curl up in a ball on the cold floor and cry for three hours. You can surely swallow those fucking meds and go the fuck to sleep right afterwards to block out nausea. Even if you DO get nauseous, at least you’re not fucked up in the head but in the stomach instead.

Do not isolate yourself. Call your parents right now if you haven’t called them today. Just say hi and talk about the latest football match or some shit. Just CALL THEM. Text your friends random shit if you need to. Don’t isolate, EVER. You HAVE TO text and/or call at least two friends every day. Do it. Do that shit. Right now. THIS IS CRITICAL.

If you think that people hate you and want you dead, go the fuck on a walk. Yes, do that shit. Drag yourself out of the fucking house. I don’t want to hear “But I am too depressed for it!”, “I just came back from a walk!”, “I will already go outside tomorrow!” or whatever. Get the FUCK out there, put your earphones on with some nice old jazz or rock, and don’t come back till the album is done. NO SAD MUSIC.

Yes, you are NOT allowed to listen to sad music. “But it’s poetic!” my ass. You’re gonna think about imaginary scenarios or distant past memories where bad shit happens. You’re gonna relive it in your fucking head until you find it hard to move your limbs. We don’t do that here. Put on some fucking Pitbull. Just try. Start with ONE song and see if you’re able to get that melody out of your head :)

Eat well. Sleep well. Drink water. Why the fuck would you skip those? Oyster, you’re not a child. You have better ways of expressing your emotions than “punishing” yourself with these. Just go on a fucking walk or some shit. You are an adult. It doesn’t help anyone when you do that shit.

No self-harm, EVER. Directly or indirectly. NEVER. Look brother, like I said, you’re not making a point by hurting yourself like that. It’s not a form of expression. C’mon. Pick flowers, pinecones, even fallen leaves, whatever you can find. Just go the fuck outside, man. You’re not making a point by that. No one’s gonna look at you and notice your scars or how much you’ve lost weight. You’ll be trying to hide them in shame anyway. Even if people do notice, you’re gonna lie about it. I know you, Oyster. Just be direct if you need help. Fucking yourself up isn’t the perfect statement you’re thinking of.

No, you’re not a burden. Humanity has been formed to support each other anyway. I am telling you, I am a historian, you have to trust me on this shit. Don’t try to insult history by saying “I am a burden”. No one is.

“But I have proof that my loved ones hate me!”: Brother, you had “proof” that your parents had sold you to the deep state before your birth for an experiment to be run on you. You see, your “proof” isn’t always the most reliable thing on earth. You are overthinking. It’s ok to admit it. Just breathe. Our brains do that shit sometimes. Don’t give it any power. If it gets powerful enough, it’s gonna invite you on a dawn duel and we don’t want that shit. This town is only big enough for one cowboy, and that cowboy is NOT overthinking.

If people seem to ""disappear"", remember that they have work! Your professors take days to reply to urgent emails too. Of course your loved ones can take hours, even days, if they are busy as fuck. Yes, that's why your sister leaves you on seen. She is busy as shit.

If people seem dry in their tone, ask yourself what you are looking for. You want your parents to cheerfully run to you and shower you with affection in every sentence, every day? Brother, people are PEOPLE. Not programmed robots. Remember, THEY also ask you “Why are you dry?” when you’re in a depressive episode. Your understanding of human communication is very warped right now. Remember: if they hated you, they wouldn’t be here. They wouldn't be calling you happily on the phone every few days, alright? 

Brother, let me be real with you. Human beings usually don’t sit down every single day and have active “hate sessions” while rubbing their hands and actively imagining bad scenarios about you. They don’t do that. You’re not a politician or a fictional character. People wouldn’t hate you as a hobby. C’mon.

If you suddenly feel different about people, could be your closest folks or random people in your class, just take a moment. What changed? They didn’t do anything, did they? If they did something “wrong”, write it down. Write what exactly changed your perception about them. Your mother forgot to call you for a day? Brother, she’s a fucking doctor. She forgets her own name sometimes. She’s gonna call tomorrow or the next day, just wait. And if you call her now, she’s gonna pick up, you know?

And if you suddenly think that people have “wronged” you, ask yourself why. You were late to a class by ten minutes and someone took your good spot? Brother, they thought you were not coming. They couldn’t have known.

Brother, no one other than you is aware of the fact that you are very depressed at the moment. Even if you do tell them “I am in a depressive episode”, people have no way of knowing how long it will last. Even if they somehow knew, they wouldn’t be able to tell your exact triggers. Someone might get frustrated at something and have a low mood. They really have no way of knowing that their low mood makes you self-question your actions and your “goodness”. C’mon.

If you have a bad day that makes you feel horrible things, it’s ok man. Every single person in history had their fuck-ups. Then they sat the fuck down, cried it out, got the fuck up, and kept going. Brother, imagine a Roman sculptor getting commissioned for an imperial portrait. Lad finally finishes it, and then drops that shit and it breaks. Surely it happened in history. Surely the sculptors have fucking sat down to cry it out. We’re gonna keep the “cry it out” part as short as we can, and we will get you the fuck up to get you back on track. It’s completely normal to feel like your world is crashing down. But brother, ask yourself: have you wiped out the human race by accident or something? If your answer is “no”, it’s not THAT bad, brother. And if your answer is “yes”, well, you done fucked up brother, but we will handle it. Try not to wipe out the human race next time.

If you’re sad, you HAVE TO put on a Pitbull song and sing along for the entirety of it (only the English parts, if you don’t trust yourself with the Spanish—no, the entirely Spanish songs don’t count, you don’t know Spanish). If you’re extra sad, you are REQUIRED TO do some hand movements and shit too. It’s gonna feel better. You HAVE TO do this. I am FORCING you, if you are not voluntarily doing it. If you don’t want Pitbull, try upbeat Lady Gaga, Kesha, JLo or all that 2010 party mixes. Sing along to the ENTIRETY of it, open up the lyrics or some shit, do it!

If you need to grieve for the loss of your mental or physical health, think about it. Is it new, really? Brother, you have been fucked up in the flesh and mind for many years now. Shit’s no news. Surely there are things you couldn’t really register, so if you are REALLY reminded of the bad times, give yourself 24 hours to grieve. TWENTY-FOUR hours only to feel whatever the fuck you want to feel, sing aloud to obscure songs about sicknesses or shit, lock yourself in the shower and cry sitting there. Do whatever. But after those twenty-four hours, you are getting the fuck back on track, brother. You are not allowed to grieve again for two months at least. Instead, make yourself some coffee or something. And you are obligated to sing along to at least THREE Pitbull songs.

People care, Oyster. You care so much about people too. What makes you think that this care of yours wouldn’t be returned? Why would you be the exception to the “everyone is worthy of love” rule? You haven’t set off a nuclear bomb to activate a doomsday device or some shit, like that Kubrick movie Dr. Strangelove. Even then, they had time to have their cheery jokes. No one strangled another.

 

Shit to remember:

* Did you eat preferably at least two meals today? Were they actually good? Did you get full?
* How much water did you drink? Oyster, what the fuck are you expecting your kidneys to run on? Drink some water right now!
* Is the fridge miserably empty? Stock it up, brother.
* Have you been wearing the same clothes for the past 3 days? Brother no, 2 days on a row is the limit. C’mon. Change.
* Got clean clothes? Do the laundry, man. When was the last time you’ve done the laundry?
* Take a shower. Warm water will feel good. Don’t stay in too much, it’s gonna make you think about some sad shit. Sing along to some 2010s party songs and drag yourself out after you sing a few, that’s all.
* Any assignments you’re forgetting? C’mon brother. Check the exam dates.
* Texted/called family today? Do it.
* Text at least two friends.
* Take a FUCKING walk, every single day, multiple times if needed. Did you take a walk today?

Let’s be real: It’s about your brain chemicals. It’s gonna feel like shit. You’re gonna find it hard to get out of bed. That’s depression. And you can’t kill it. I know how people say shit like “You can solve it with a good mindset!” but it’s about the fucking brain chemicals. There’s no miracle cure, Oyster. The scientists don’t know how to stop the snowstorms either, but people dress up in warm clothes for a reason. I can’t stop the snowstorm for you, but I’m giving you warm clothes. If you wear them, we’ll get through this without a frostbite.

If you can’t handle it, for any reason, tell people. Reach out. It’s better than nothing. People are there for you.",2,1730484893.0,bipolar1,0,1.0,False
1ghbzdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/1ghbzdb/single_people_of_tulsa_would_anyone_actually_be/,"Single people of Tulsa, would anyone actually be interested in this?","Okay fellow single people, I’ve been kicking around an idea for a while and I want to see if there’s any interest. Like most of y’all, I’m fucking TIRED of the dating apps and when I’m over something I have a tendency to just create my own thing to replace it so I was thinking about starting to plan and host monthly events for single folks who are interested in serious connections. Not matchmaking, just a container for single people to meet each other, so a fun activity, and have some deep conversation.

This would be application only and require a one-time application fee of like $50 to pay for a background check and time spent vetting social media (to make sure there aren’t any secret kids, wives, girlfriends, husbands, boyfriends, etc…) and a short interview just to make sure people won’t just sit there like 🫥 with no conversation.

Events would be something like a cooking class or art project (kind of depends on what people are interested in) and then coffee/beer and conversation with whoever you feel like talking to. Folks would just pay for their own activity fees (with a group discount of course).

Benefits: 

— vetted dating pool, so you at least know they don’t have a criminal record or a secret wife
- no planning on your part, just register and show up
- Everyone has some skin in the game (financially) so they at least have some level of commitment to serious dating
- talk to whoever tf you want, so at least if there isn’t a romantic match, you can make some new single friends
- try something new or participate in a fun social activity
- no swiping! 

Is this something any of y’all would be interested in? I was just thinking about what I would prefer when it comes to dating so I would love some feedback on the idea. 

ETA: I’m 36F and the original thought on this was for people in the 30s & 40s age group, mostly just because that’s what I’m familiar with through lived experience. ",13,1730484838.0,tulsa,32,0.72,False

I'm a virgin with zero dating experience, and I’m insecure about it. I met this girl at a 10-day summer camp for young adults a few months ago, and we hit it off. I developed feelings for her pretty quickly but didn’t tell her. We kept chatting in DMs pretty often, and whenever we talk, it feels like we genuinely enjoy each other’s company. We've bumped into each other a few times too (purely by coincidence).

A few weeks ago, I finally asked her out for coffee (I didn’t think I had the guts to do it at first), but she said she’d be busy that weekend and that it’s hard for her to find time to hang out during the school term.

Normally, I’d take this as a sign to back off, but I’m trying to push past my tendency to assume the worst and give up before even trying.

What do you think? Should I ask her out again later? Should I just tell her how I feel?

Any advice, personal experiences, or video/resource suggestions would be deeply appreciated. I tried to keep the post short and concise, so if you think more context would be helpful, feel free to ask.

P.S. I used ChatGPT to help me write this post because I was having a hard time explaining myself—hope it doesn’t seem low effort.",1,1730484832.0,Healthygamergg,3,1.0,False

1ghbyjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/DadForAMinute/comments/1ghbyjh/dad_how_can_i_tackle_harassment_at_workplace/,"Dad, how can I tackle harassment at workplace? ","I wish I had my dad here, and that I could talk about this to him, but here where I'm interning, these people are using me like a slave, they make me pick up waste by hands, clean the floor, serve coffee to everyone, and also shit ton of their work. 

I am made to work instead of labourers, and they deliberately ask the labour to stop working and ask me to take their place, when they see I'm well dressed in formals for my office. (I'm an architect, for reference) And am made to lift up bricks, wood logs and mud. And also, mentally sick because all 4 keep taunting me for everything, and if I put on earphones to ignore them, it is presented to the boss as if I'm just windling away time listening to music, and boss takes their side as I'm just an intern and they are the permanent people. 

They purposely once took a scissor and tore up my shirt and asked me to pick up rags as I looked like a ragpicker. 

I am sorry, I don't want to complain, as this is a year long internship and if they give a bad remark about me, my college degree will be paused until I repeat the entire year-long internship. 

I feel so alone dad, I miss you, I wish you were here. I don't need anything but a shoulder to cry on.

Nagkachat kami sa Tindr tapos nagkapalitan ng IG then dun na kami nag usap everyday. Nung una lowkey landian lang mga casual eme lang. First “red flag” I can’t tell if this is actually a red flag pero let’s just call it that para maintindihan mo’ko haha! Diba nga rich kid si koya, di ko masabayan mga trip at reklamo n’ya sa buhay. Unemployed si koya ha pero may pangmalakasang family business sila at kapag nauutusan s’ya na related sa business nila, may “sweldo” naman s’ya. Ginagawa lang n’ya yung “utos” na yon twice a month at binibigyan s’ya ng 15k per utos so 30k a month for working for TWO FUCKING DAYS. AND HE’S STILL COMPLAINING ABOUT IT!!
Second red flag, kapag nauutusan s’ya sa bahay nila idk kung ano basta kapag inuutusan s’ya sa kanila nagrereklamo na naman si koya to the point na gusto na mag layas, naghahanap na nga ng bahay na rerentahan daw n’ya para bumukod na s’ya. IMAGINE! Unemployed na puro reklamo, gusto bumukod. RICH KID!!
Third red flag, magastos level 10. One time sabi ko may gusto ko panuodin na movie, ang nasa isip ko sa malapit na SM lang ako manunuod kung gusto n’ya sumama edi go. Tapos alam mo reply sakin, tara daw nuod daw kami sa SM North Edsa or somewhere basta around Metro Manila. Aba’y pota para lang sa sine!? Meron namang malapit!! Ending nanuod ako mag isa hindi ko nalang binanggit sa kanya. Tapos pa eto, hindi pa kami nagkikita actually pero hindi naman s’ya kalayuan ha, two towns away from me s’ya. Hindi man lang n’ya ko ayain magmeet muna sa malapit lang. Coffee, dinner, getting to know each other stage ganon haha! Alam mo ba ang gusto!? MAG OUT OF TOWN KAMI FOR THREE DAYS!! FIRST! MEET! UP! Sagot naman daw n’ya yung hotel. PERO KAHIT NA! First meet up yon teh anong gusto mong ma feel ko? Hindi ako dalagang pilipina pero parang ang weird and to the highest level naman yon, at least for me ha. Actually nung una staycation lang sa Manila ang gusto ni koya pero hindi naman natuloy yon tapos biglang gusto n’ya mag Zambales kami kasi parang gusto daw n’ya mag beach!! Kaloka!!
Tapos pa bago ko s’ya nag start na hindi na ichat ang huling conversation namin is, nagpunta s’ya ng La Union inaya lang daw s’ya nga mga tita n’ya yata? Tapos after one or two days gusto na n’ya umuwi aba’y si koyang rich kid nag book ng lalamove na parang grab pauwi!! Imagine!! From La Union to Bulacan Grab!!
Basically, hindi kami magka vibe. Hindi ako maka feel sa kanya ng sincerity. Feeling ko lahat ng “plano” n’ya na gawin namin, like yun ngang staycation, out of town eme, sine, parang wala s’ya balak gawin talaga. Alam mo yun, yung parang idea lang n’ya lahat nang yon pero hindi ko ma feel na willing s’ya at gusto n’ya talaga and mostly ayoko din naman talaga na ganon ang first meet up namin. Masyado s’yang mabilis, which is not a problem to me generally pero yung way ng pagiging mabilis n’ya e it’s giving red flag talaga.
