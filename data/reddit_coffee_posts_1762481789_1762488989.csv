1oqkirs,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragranceaustralia/comments/1oqkirs/grimoire_parfums_discovery_set_reflections/,Grimoire Parfums - Discovery Set Reflections,"Now that I’ve explored all five fragrances in Grimoire’s discovery set, I’ve come away with a deep appreciation for how this house approaches perfumery. Each scent feels less like a formula and more like a narrative - they're textured, emotional and very alive. What surprised me most though was how wearable they all are! Despite their complexity and use of unusual notes, every perfume feels deliberate and well balanced. The artistry never comes at the expense of enjoyment. These are conceptual fragrances that still feel really good to wear, which I think is a remarkable feat that makes them worthy of anyone’s consideration.

Below is a rundown of each perfume, drawn from my individual reviews, with my ratings and recommendations.

\----------

**Nephilim**  
A perfume that feels like walking through a centuries old cathedral garden after rain. The pepper opens sharp but not harsh, leading into tomato leaf and angelica that bring wonderfully crisp and fresh greenness. The floral heart is divine, while the earthy-animalic base gives the whole composition a sense of sacred stillness. The longer this scent lingers, the more it feels like sunlight piercing stained glass: radiant and serene.

If you’re drawn to mysterious florals and uplifting greenery that evoke spiritual contentment, then *Nephilim* will enchant you in ways you could only pray for.

*Rating: 4/5*

**Todorac**  
A surreal gourmand where sweetness and strangeness collide. Cocoa mingles with celery, tobacco and earthy woods, which somehow for me conjured the imagery of unusually spiced cookies and liqueur offered by a stranger in a dim wood cabin. The perfume shifts between dry and syrupy textures, which is a fun sensory experience that keeps it captivating from start to finish.

If you enjoy warm, edible notes with an unsettling twist, or scents that intermingle comfort with curiosity, then *Todorac* will intrigue you completely.

*Rating: 3.5/5*

**Nøkken**  
A haunting green-woody scent that captures the sensation of standing between a water’s edge and dark forest. Shiso, galbanum, and violet leaf create a bright, leafy opening, soon joined by fir, cypress, and seaweed that deepens the fragrance into something damp and shadowy. There’s a touch of soil and a faint dank edge, like standing barefoot at the bank of a river. Despite the initial eeriness, it softens into a tranquil and meditative scent.

If you love earthy, woody and damp aquatic notes that evoke mystery and reflection, then *Nøkken* will feel like coming home to the wet wilds.

*Rating: 3.5/5*

**Penanggal**  
A luminous white floral masterpiece. Jasmine (sampaguita), ylang ylang, frangipani and magnolia bloom in the warm night air. The florals are hypnotic but never dirty, radiating purity and sensuality in equal measures. Soft fruits add sweet brightness, while sandalwood and musk anchor everything in serenity. It’s lush yet balanced - a fragrance that feels like the most exquisite fever dream.

If you love tropical florals that are sensual but clean, and want a perfume that feels like a spell cast in a sacred garden, then *Penanggal* is the bliss you’ve been yearning for.

*Rating: 4/5*

**Catoblepas**  
The most complex and introspective of the five. Earthy spices with a touch of decadent fruit set the scene for the unfurling of a sacred heart. Rose and coffee add equal parts romance and grit, while a metallic thread from the myrrh cuts through the dense smokiness like a pulse. As it dries down, it softens into a shadowy warmth that clings to the skin like reverence. It’s dark and spiritual yet deeply human.

If you’re drawn to scents that feel ancient and grounding yet stir quiet emotional turmoil, *Catoblepas* will move you.

*Rating: 4.5/5*

\----------

Troy of Grimoire Parfums’ first collection sits at the crossroads of beauty and strangeness. These are perfumes that challenge as much as they comfort. They reward patience and curiosity but never feel alien or pretentious. They wear beautifully, they tell stories and they engage the mind. Most importantly, they smell SO amazing\*!\* There’s a time and place for all five of these gorgeous works of art.

i recently got hired at starbucks after no local shops contacted me back after i applied at their stores. i just did all of the online training (took about 4 hours) and i got so depressed how different everything was and how it was hardly coffee (which i already knew, but reality hit lol). something i really loved when working at local shops was the ritual of dialing and pulling shots, steaming milk, pouring latte art, and caring about coffee. I was so sad seeing them just pour steamed milk into the cup without even attempting latte art; literally just dumped it in.

i took the job because the pay and benefits were pretty good and i am in desperate need for a job. but i also received an email back today from a local shop for an interview. i'm going to schedule it just to have options, but would it be wise to drop the starbucks job for the local shop if i get hired there?

for added context: i live in a college town and i have a serving job i'm starting next week as well. i know for a fact i would be happier at the local shop, especially because my goal is to grow as a barista, but i know i should also be practical because there are bills that need to be paid.

please be kind! if you were in my situation, what would you do?

TL;DR just started at starbucks out of desperate need for job but got offered an interview at a local shop. goal is to grow as a barista but also get bills paid/food on the table. what would you do?",1,1762488268.0,barista,1,1.0,False

1oqkgio,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oqkgio,I need some advice.,"I’m 24 I’ve been doing carpentry since I was 16, where I did an apprenticeship at the Center For Wooden Boats; got a job right out of high school and have been working and apprenticing ever since. 
Over the past year I’ve been transitioning into a superintendent role for my current GC over the past year. I’ve done some small projects and taken over for a previous super that got fired for stealing time. I took over and didn’t receive a raise or title change- but I was okay with that because it was an opportunity to prove myself and to show that I was capable. I took over just before framing and took the job all the way through finishes and punch/completion. Clients were very happy and said how much they appreciated me etc. 

Talked to my boss about getting a raise and title change he said that he wanted to give me some other smaller projects before agreeing to call me a superintendent. And that I wouldn’t receive a raise or anything until he felt like I could do every facet of being a superintendent. I was a little frustrated but figured this was just the game. I tackled a fence project, a small deck, a bathroom remodel in a coffee shop, and two kitchen cabinet installs.

At the beginning of September I was given my first start to finish big project ($320k before tax) a double bathroom and kitchen remodel in a very nice condo building. Up until this point I’d been cool about no raise etc. but this was the point where I figured I’d put my foot down and practically demanded a raise I was making 37 and wanted 42 (working in seattle) he flat out said no that he wasn’t convinced I could do the job- all of my other jobs were on time at or under budget and I worked my ass of to keep it that way. But I’m a bitch and just said oh well guess I have to work harder. 

This next job in the condo was supposed to be pretty substantial in terms of timeline as it was a full gut for bathrooms and Kitchen, for a relatively high profile and wealthy client. I created a budget and scope, got the schedule made up and did a pre-construction walkthrough with the interior designer in late August. Everything seemed like it was going to be fine. 

When I got the job it turned out that the clients had been sold on the idea that I could gut their two bathrooms replace with all tile and showers a new bed unit new kitchen cabs- new counters- new paint, replace and trim all their doors and most of their base- all in 8 weeks. 
I tried to explain that that’s practically impossible and then found out my boss told them that this timeline was feasible and they already had signed the contract for a completion date 8 weeks away. I was fucked. 

I actually almost finished in 8 weeks- today was my final walkthrough and the clients were pleased with the work and commended me for all my effort. I worked 8 60-70 hour weeks to make the job happen doing paperwork, processing invoices, scheduling subs, dealing with clients all the while doing almost all of the work myself with some subcontractor help. I asked for a raise and title change today. My Boss said I could call myself a superintendent if I wanted- but that the overtime I got made up for the raise I wanted. 

Personally- I feel betrayed and am interviewing at other companies starting next week. 

Questions I have 
- is it reasonable to feel betrayed?
- is this how the industry just works? 
- am I being unreasonable asking for a raise? 
- should I have said no when I found out the timeline? 

Thanks 🤙

1oqkg4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/1oqkg4r/tried_some_alternatives_back_to_ynab_i_come/,Tried Some Alternatives - Back to YNAB I Come.,"Howdy YNABers,

As my financial needs have evolved over time, I've taken it upon myself to re-evaluate if YNAB is still the right financial tool for me. YNAB (and zero-based budgeting) have been an incredible system that helped me learn how to manage money when I was just starting in my career many years ago, but the time consuming nature of maintaining YNAB (or a spreadsheet) often drags me down a bit these days. While it isn't all \*that\* time consuming, the double entry accounting of YNAB can be a bit tedious and feels like a chore. This, again, is great for those starting out, but the value of tracking every single penny tends to wear off when one is closer to reaching FI or isn't wanting to have a very cash-heavy position that covers every single possible outcome.

As an example of this, I am no longer at a point where spending an extra $1.00/month on a coffee is a big deal, but YNAB will automatically flag this as an overage that MUST be accounted for. That kind of granularity and precision used to be helpful, but doesn't provide nearly as much utility anymore. If anything, it creates unnecessary friction between my budget and I.

I recently tried Monarch and Simplifi for \~two months each (while also maintaining my YNAB) and overall I find that I just can't vibe with them at all after years of YNAB. They're both very pretty and have lots of features, along with nice charts. However, I found setting up an actual budget in them to be too time consuming and frankly, exhausting. Rather than provide raw functionality, they seem to focus more on the glitz/glimmer and reporting of the platform.

To find a happy medium between 'tracking literally every penny to a T' and having some flexibility, I've decided to just simplify my budget in YNAB into my monthly budget is literally three 'all encompassing' categories, five bills, and seven broad sinking fund categories.

What have other YNABers in this situation done?",5,1762488099.0,ynab,0,1.0,False
1oqkfyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/panicdisorder/comments/1oqkfyj/accidentally_drank_caffeine/,Accidentally drank Caffeine,"Hi all!

It’s currently 10:56pm, and I’m in need of some reassurance.

A little after 7pm my boyfriend and I went to grab the christmas drinks from starbucks because they’re finally here. We ordered the sugar cookie frappuccinos, and I asked for the Créme frappuccino because there’s no coffee in it. Well it took me till about half of mine had been drank to realize that they did not give me what I ordered and it was actually the regular one with coffee. I know I only drank half, and it was a Grande size so technically I didn’t drink that much coffee, but I’ve been free from caffeine for a while and just recently started very very slowly easing back into it just by sipping from my boyfriend’s morning coffee to start. 

Last time I consumed caffeine in one drink (a boba tea with my dinner) I woke up in a panic in the middle of the night with my heart pounding, so I’m just really anxious right now, and I need some logical people to help reassure me that there’s no need to worry. 😓 I haven’t had a panic attack in about a month now and I don’t want to lose my progress. 

TL;DR: Starbucks gave me caffeinated drink when i asked for decaf, drank half before realizing and i’m worried it’ll spike my heart rate tonight and give me a panic attack ",1,1762488084.0,panicdisorder,2,1.0,False

1oqk9fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1oqk9fo/aa_coureurmirror_steampunk_fantasyshort/,[AA] Coureur—Mirror [Steampunk Fantasy][Short Story][Finished],"Description: A crew of veteran Dragon Hunters is out on a mission yet again, though what they face is far more sinister than anything they have ever faced before.  
A rogue airship of hunters has been spotted; the crew of Coureur is ordered to investigate the sighting.

.\*\*\*\*\*\*

The radar bleeped in an alerting tone.

“Contact, two-five, bearing East, air-vessel,” reported a crew member to his captain.

“Size? Class? Civilian?” the captain inquired, grabbing his spyglass and peering out the window.

“Uhh, medium-sized, Coureur-class combat vessel judging by the signature.”

“Get me a visual, radio them,” the captain ordered. The helmsman quickly adjusted the course. The mana-cores hummed as the propellers accelerated. The ship jerked ever so slightly.

A few minutes of futile contact attempts later, the ship climbed through a low cloud above where the contact was.

“Visual, 1-5. Hunter ship,” called out one of the scouts from the outside. The captain turned his spyglass.

“Confirmed. Radio?”

“Nothing sir,” called out the radio operator.

“Keep trying, get us closer. Light signal them too, they look pretty banged up, might need assistance.”

As they neared, the ship turned, not toward them but broadside.

“I see their identifier. It’s Marcheur sir, the missing vessel,” called out one of the scouts.

“Sir? They’re adjusting course,” called out the radar operator.

“Keep dist-” began the captain but his order was muffled by the roar of cannons as the Marcheur’s port-side opened up in full fury.

Iron balls tore through the scout vessel’s thin hull, tearing it to shreds. A pained scream came from the outside, one of the crew members found himself tumbling through the air, plummeting to his demise.

“Evasive maneuvers! Cut the engines, free-fall,” the captain ordered as splinters from cannonball’s impact tore into the skin of his right leg.

The ship’s mana-core’s hum ceased, the right propeller was no more.

“Mayday, mayday, Eagle-eye going down, I repeat, Eagle-eye going down,” called out the radio operator on the open channel.

\*

It’s been a couple of days since the incident. The crash site was discovered, but the rogue ship was gone.

“Sir? Witness has arrived,” called out an officer as he entered through the door to the Dragon Hunter’s guild leader.

“Send him in.”

With a pained groan and a heavy limp, a scout from the Eagle-eye entered through the door, leaning heavily on a cane.

“Sir.”

The guild leader lowered the report he was reading and glanced up. “I read the report, but I need to hear it in person.”

The scout nodded and re-told the events of that morning in full detail.

“That can’t be, Marcheur was a wreck after the accursed Game of Fate, I personally attended their Captain’s burial,” the guild leader replied softly.

“Saw it with m’own eyes.”

The guild leader glanced over stacks upon stacks of reports, crew compensations, hazard pays, and dragon sightings.

“Coureur at the dock?” the guild leader queried.

“Yes sir,” replied the officer.

“I hate to do it, but, send Ashlandis and her crew.”

\*

She sat upon the bowsprit of her ship. The palms of her hand firmly pressed against the rough wood of the bowsprit. The chaos of rush behind her was finally calming. There were thuds of cannonballs and dragon piercers against the deck. She felt something heavy scrape against the deck. She winced, her eyes still closed.

“Captain?” called out a man, “We’re almost ready. How is she?”

Ashlandis slid her hands up and down slightly, as if caressing the coarse wood beneath her hands, “She trembles in fright, Cid.”

The man placed his hand upon the railing of the airship, stroking it slowly.

“And you?”

Ashy glanced over her shoulder, opening her eyes at last.

“I too. If Marcheur flies once more, the captain can’t be my mentor. Either way, this isn’t right, none of this is right.”

Her gaze wandered the deck.

“Set sail when ready,” she commanded.

“Aye aye.”

Her engines coughed to life; she may be old and tired, but she was strong, she was a living legend.

“Coureur ready to set sail,” called out the helmsman.

“Clamps away, bon voyage,” shouted the dock crew, unleashing her into her voyage.

There was no escort. No backup. The guild was stretched thin and they were losing entire fleets in unprecedented battles. Coureur was to handle the threat herself. Ashlandis knew that whatever they’d face would be unlike anything she had ever witnessed before. She, who had seen the might of dragons firsthand, trembled with fear. She knew that something was very wrong, but she also knew that humanity needed them; they needed the Dragon Hunters.

Days passed in silence. Everything felt wrong. The captain was quieter than ever, no encouragements, just duty. She checked on her crew as usual, she aided them as she always did, but her mind was adrift, and they could tell, but couldn’t do anything about it.

The dawn broke with a bleep of the radar.

“Contact, 2-8-5, air-vessel, seems to be the one.” called out the navigator.

“Bingo,” Cid replied.

“I’ll wake the captain.”

She stumbled out of her room, armed with a freshly brewed coffee and fighting a desperate battle against morning grogginess.

As she peered at the radar and sipped on her coffee, she nodded, “Maintain course and distance of 20 kilometers. Do not get closer until I give the order.”

“Roger that,” the navigator replied. She leaned on the railing, spyglass in 1 hand, coffee mug in the other.

“She still trembles?”

Cid queried, pulling on the sail’s rope to make sure it was tight.

“Ever since we left the port,” Ashlandis replied, taking a sip of her coffee.

“It can’t be them,” Cid responded, glancing around.

“I know,” she shot back, “But our enemy is ruthless. They’ll do anything to play us.”

“We should’ve retired after that cursed game,” Cid turned to leave, “Left it to the younglings.”

Ashy looked out to the horizon, “They aren’t ready for the horrors of the enemy, not yet. We keep losing the fresh crews while the veterans only grow older. I fear,” she began.

“We won’t lose,” Cid replied and walked off.

“Wake me when we get a visual, I’ll catch a wink for now.”

She felt a clump in her throat and her chest tightened as she looked through the spyglass. The visual was as petrifying and heart-wrenching as she imagined it to be. The name on the side of her hull read

“Marche-” the last couple of letters were missing, replaced by a gaping hole where a dragon tore through the ship’s hull. The rear mast was broken, missing. The front mast was barely intact, but there were no sails upon it, only a few remaining bits of it, like rags hanging upon a drier, flailing frantically in the wind. She could see movement, people walking around its deck, though it was too far to tell any details.

For the rest of the day, Coureur danced an intricate dance with the Marcheur, or rather what Ashlandis would describe as the ‘ghostly shell’ of it. It looked to be barely afloat, yet capable of much the same maneuvers as the Coureur herself, since Marcheur repeated every move that Ashlandis ordered her crew to make.

“Hard left, maintain distance,” and the Marcheur would mirror it.

“Hold position,” she ordered, and Marcheur did the same.

Like a twisted mirror, an alternate reality. It knew what she would do, sometimes it would begin a maneuver before she even ordered it. This dance lasted till sunset, while the crew remained on high alert, ready for anything. Slowly but surely the gap narrowed and ships got closer, still maintaining a few kilometers' safety margin, remaining firmly out of cannon’s reach.

The dusk came before long, bearing with it nightmares. That evening the crew sat in silence in the chow hall once more, readying for their restless night as the ships continued their intricate dance, keeping just outside the range of each other, but the crew was burning with anxiety of what might happen next. It was at this point that Cid spoke up, breaking the deathly silence at last, “Chef? Are we out of spices or what? It’s so, bland and tasteless tonight.”

The silence was heavier than ever before as the rest of the crew impatiently took another sip of the stew, only now realizing that indeed the meal was bland and tasteless.

“Yeah, it is,” replied the mechanic. The chef savored his meal.

“No boss, we have plenty of salt, want some more?” he tended the table with a small bowl of salt. Cid, the first hand, sprinkled some more on his food and tasted it again. The crew watched him in anticipation. He chewed slowly and meticulously.

\*

“I taste nothing,” he said, shaking his head. The mechanic dipped his entire finger in salt and licked it, “Tasteless like an old piece of badly made bread.”

Commotion arose amongst the crew, but was brought to order by a fist slamming against the table.

“SILENCE! Our enemy is playing tricks upon our minds. Double the night-watch, high alert, but get some rest,” Ashlandis ordered her crew.

That night was short and tense. Seemingly as she fell asleep, the hull of Coureur reverberated with a melody she had never heard before. Inhuman, growly, deep, and petrifying melody, a song of war, a song of dragons. Wooded hull creaked, and the planks shrieked in fright. She laid in her bunk, listening to the melody that resembled war-horns, then got up. Something was wrong, and her instincts wouldn’t let her rest till she set it right.

\*

She stepped out onto the hallway and heard the melody in new tones, more human this time. It was coming from the crew quarters. As she peered into their sleeping area, she heard one man humming in his sleep the same melody that made the ship tremble. Hesitation filled her heart for a moment, she neared the humming crewman. His eyes shot open, he glared at her, and his throat reverberated with the song. He grabbed her wrist, pulling her closer, his pupils turned ember in color as he looked deeply into her eyes, “SHE IS WAKING,” he shouted.

Someone else leaped out of their hammock; it was one of the hunters, Leiya. Her movements were swift, she drew her knife and lunged at the captain with the precision of a predator. Ashlandis stepped back, avoiding the attack that, as she now learned, was aimed at the possessed crewmember. He blocked it with ease, his eyes burning from within.

“SHE! WILL! WEAR! YOUR! SKIN!”

\*

The shout was loud, and the crew awoke. Someone rang the bell, and Ashlandis gasped at the chaos that erupted around her in mere seconds. From sleeping calm to raging storm, her crew was up and ready for action. They were hunters, they were always ready.

“MUTINY!” someone shouted. The possessed crewmember was dragged off.

“Captain? You alright?” queried Leiya.

“All good. ALL HANDS ON DECK! FULL READY! HUNTERS EQUIP YOURSELVES!”

Hunters put on their harnesses, mobile power packs and dragon hunting lances. They lined the sides of the ship. Lights ablaze, illuminating the deck, clouds around, and the hull of the vessel. The alarm no longer rang and the silence was only occasionally interrupted with a metallic clank of the hunter’s gear.

To their surprise, no attack came. The dawn broke, and Marcheur still sat at the same distance, as if watching them, gauging their reaction, their readiness.

“This is wrong,” Ashlandis commented, watching the sun creep up over the horizon.

“How is he?” she queried. Cid scratched the back of his head, “Uh, normal? He’s normal. Awake, conscious and normal. He says he remembers nothing, not the song, not the words he spoke to you.”

The mountain peaks cast long shadows as the sun rose higher.

“Break off, put up distance, keep it just within radar range,” Ashlandis ordered. Her hand gently caressing the railing.

“Sir?” Cid queried.

“You heard me, we’re breaking off.”

“Sir!” he confirmed with a confident nod and relayed the order. The ship’s propellers roared to life as it made a sharp turn. Hunters braced, remaining at their positions, armed with power-lances, lining the sides of the ship. The Coureur was a medium sized dragon hunter, bearing a crew of 18, two shifts, two navigators, two engineers, and 8 hunters. The rest of the crew were hunter assistants and cannoneers. The hunters remained diligent on their posts despite the fact that the ship leaned heavily to the side as it turned max speed.

“Sir? The Marcheur began moving, course set to intercept us in,” the navigator hesitated, “15 minutes.”

“Adjust the course, 1-5-5, full speed ahead, keep ahead of them,” Cid called out.

“They’ve matched, they’re gaining on us, somehow.”

Cid growled, his heart began to thump in his chest, “Wind direction?”

“South, sir,” replied one of the cannoneers from outside the bridge.

“Sails down, full ahead.”

But their efforts were in vain. Every move the Coureur’s crew made, the Marcheur’s crew was a step ahead. They adjusted their course perfectly to intercept, and the ship was set on a course of favorable wind. As the distance between the two seemingly evenly matched ships decreased, Ashy had to prepare her exhausted crew.

“LINE US UP, PORT SIDE, CANNONS AT THE READY, HUNTERS TAKE COVER UNTIL WE’RE IN BOARDING RANGE. We don’t know what the enemy is, but whatever it is, FIGHT TILL THE END! Coureur will NOT GO QUIETLY INTO THE NIGHT!”

The crew obeyed and braced. 5 kilometers and closing.

Two kilometers and the cannons roared to life. ‘Too soon’ Ashlandis thought watching the cannonballs of the Marcheur fall short. One and a half, and she shouted

“OPEN FIRE.”

The hull creaked, the ship rocked as the cannons unleashed their fury.

Impacts send splinters flying through the air, Ashlandis watched through her spyglass in disbelief as her mentor shouted orders and organized his crew much in the same way as she organized hers. He gazed at her through his spyglass. A chill ran down her spine. It was him. Unmistakable him. Sebastian. She spent her teen years aboard that ship. She learned everything from him, and he, in turn, knew everything about her. Her nails dug into the wooden railing as splintered wood showered her. Another impact, cannonball tore through the living quarters. She could only hope her hunters survived. She adjusted the course, cannons be damned, she had to get her hands on their captain, she had to dig her claws into this illusion and learn the truth.

\*

The Marcheur did the same, turned and set course straight at them. Head-on collision was inevitable. The ship rocked, sudden impact tumbled half the crew over.

“BOARD!” she shouted, charging up to the bow of the ship and leaping onto a rope to throw herself over onto the other ship. Her hunters followed courageously, without a hint of hesitation.

Steel clashed and blood spilled within seconds. She landed on the enemy ship, with a precise roll she pushed herself forth, through the enemy ranks. Her gaze was locked on their captain, who, unlike her, was never the hot-headed type. He walked calmly behind the helmsman even as his crew engaged in a fight for their lives against the Coureur’s hunters.

Blades crossed, but his gaze remained unchanged; calm, collected, cold.

“SEBASTIAN!” she shouted, trying to throw his blade aside to gain an upper hand. He remained silent. Sparks flew as steel clashed against steel. She was relentless in her assault, albeit emotional as fury fueled her every move.

Each strike was diverted precisely. Each counter brought back memories of the times she sparred against her mentor. Of the times he smacked her on the head for the mistakes she made. Lost in her memories and the chaos of battle, she found her back against the broken mast, and Sebastian’s cold gaze scanning her up and down, searching for a weakness, an opening.

“GOD DAMN IT SEBASTIAN WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!?”

His response was a precise jab of the lance, aimed at her right thigh. She parried it, but only partly. As the cold steel bit into her flesh, a pained scream echoed through the battlefield.

“CAPTAIN!” Cid called out helplessly, fighting against the odds of two hunters stacked against him. Ashlandis fell to her knee, grasp still tight around the shaft of her lance. Memories flooding her mind. She spent her entire life fighting, training, learning, hunting. Sebastian was like a father to her. The sky itself began to weep. As raindrops fell upon her cheeks, she remembered the day she wept in the rain after losing her mother. Alone, abandoned, homeless, and lost.

It was that day, when she was but ten, that she learned of kindness in this world, and the horrors of it. The rain suddenly stopped whe a grumpy-looking man towered above her frail little body. He sneered, mocking, but not her, the life itself.

“Silly isn’t it?” he said.

“What is?” replied the little Ashlandis in between her weeps.

\*

“The rain, the world. It thinks it brought you down, it thinks it won, and here I am, a mere mortal man, telling it to GO FUCK ITSELF!”

He grinned proudly, “How about that huh?”

The little Ashlandis wiped her tears, “It did,” she whimpered.

“Not a chance,” the man replied.

“Life is fragile, but long enough to find something to enjoy. You can sit here, and weep in the rain, or you could trust a stranger and rise anew.”

He extended his hand to the small, frail child.

“Come now, let’s get you a hot meal and some dry clothes.”

She reached for him. Lightning flashed, blinding her momentarily. There he was again, towering above a small frail girl, defeated and desperate. Her grasp on the lance loosened as she reached desperately for him, “Please, no. Not by your hand,” she cried out. His body froze in place. It shimmered for a moment, turning see-through just long enough to make her doubt what she was seeing, then, he spoke at last.

“NOT BY HIS HAND INDEED! BY MINE INSTEAD!”

Ashlandis recoiled. Her mind reeled, and instincts screamed. It was not a human voice. He was not human.

“I! WILL! DESTROY YOUR KIND! I WILL WEAR YOUR SKIN JUST AS YOU DID TO MY KIND!”

The voice was deep and low, rumbling like the thunder.

“I WILL TEAR YOU—FLESH AND BONE! GRIND YOU ALL INTO DUST!”

The chaos of battle came to a halt. Silence. Short but deafening silence. Ashlandis pushed herself up, back still firmly pressed against the mast, she leaned heavily on her lance, “What in the hells are you?”

Sebastian’s body stepped aside, “I! AM! YOUR! DEMISE!” she watched him just long enough to take in his words, but then the mountains in the distance exploded, capturing her attention entirely.

Rocks flew and dust veiled what once used to be mountains, but it was swif,tly removed by a flap of titanic wings, and a roar akin to a volcanic eruption. Ashlandis froze, staring in fright at the behemoth in the distance. The dragon was the size of a mountain, unlike anything she had ever witnessed before.

“YOUR END HAS COME! I! HAVE AWAKENED!”

She gazed at her mentor once more. His body slowly turned transparent.

The ship’s mana core hummed louder.

“RETURN!” Ashalndis shouted, limping swiftly down the stairs and running toward the bow of the Marcheur, “RETREAT! BACK TO THE SHIP!” she shouted, rallying her hunters, some of whom were injured, and others no longer breathed.

Coureur jerked as the lodged Marcheur began to plummet.

“It’s lodged in us, we won’t hold for very long,” shouted the helmsman.

“Divert full power to vertical stabilizers, mana core into overdrive,” Ashlandis ordered, limping out the bridge onto the deck, “Unchain the cannons, open fire at the Marcheur, we need it gone, NOW!”

The cannon’s roared and at last, they were free of the wreck that was dragging them down, slowly but surely toward their demise. They were safe, for now, though it seemed as though this only delayed the inevitable. Ashlandis clung to the railings of her ship, watching the titanic dragon stretch its wings, eclipsing villages in shadows.

“Those towns and villages,” Cid spoke softly.

“Are doomed,” Ashlandis replied to him. Her voice shook, and every word was a struggle.

Cid glanced at her. A tear glistened on her cheek.

“There are hundreds of them,” she uttered. Cid looked at the massive dragon’s shape in the distance.

Smaller ones began to circle it and gather. There were swarms of small ones, the size of their ship, dozens of larger ones that could single-handedly wipe entire villages, and even some large enough to destroy towns.

“We have to retreat,” he said regrettably, placing his hand on her shoulder.

“We can’t help them.”

She responded with a single, weak nod.

\*

“SET COURSE FOR THE GUILD! FULL SPEED! STOP FOR NOTHING!”

Cid shouted the command.

“Aye aye sir,” replied the helmsman. A few hunters, still in full equipment, watched the scenery beneath them. The silence was loud.",1,1762487524.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Here’s the thing - they don’t contribute AT ALL (even when we’ve asked). No toilet paper, no cleaning supplies, no nothing - but they’re more than happy to take. I clean the bathroom, then the roommate shaves his pubes and leaves them in the shower and she puts her hair on the shower walls. I clean the kitchen, and then she cooks and not only uses MY stuff but leaves a mess and drips on the counters etc and doesn’t wipe it up. Not to mention leaving dishes in the since for a week (literally we have ONE fork rn bc roommate and his gf have used them all and they’re sitting on the sink dirty) sometimes WITH FOOD. This whole week she’s been here my bf has been out of town and she’s literally living on the couch and will be like “oh I’ll get off the tv in a sec” and then DOESNT. She literally doesn’t have a job or anything going on. She sits at home all day and makes a mess. Not to mention they drink MY coffee that I brew and never even asked. Here’s the kicker - my bfs mom sent us our favorite candies for Halloween. The roomate started eating them and my bf was like no u can’t have those but u can have the crackers and nuts. Now there’s literally one package of sour patch left (my fav) and they’re eating the Reeces in the fridge my bf takes for his work lunches. 

I’m going crazy. I put the candy away and if they ask about it I might crash out. The one sour patch left and finding her nail clippings in the sink is making me crash out. 

This gf lives at home with her parents but we’re all mid-20s. Literally none of my college roommates behaved like this and my bf and I have talked to them about their messes more than once. ",1,1762487394.0,badroommates,0,1.0,False

1oqk5tg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oqk5tg,A Hate/Love Story: My Khamrah Qahwa (personal experience),"So, I did a thing. Back in Oct '24, I fell down the YouTube rabbit hole and got completely hyped for Khamrah Qahwa. The promise of coffee and vanilla? Sold. I clicked 'buy' on my very first Middle Eastern frag, thinking I was about to smell like a god.
First spray? A horrible alcohol and spice blast. My nose recoiled. I was so disappointed, I banished it to the back of the shelf, thinking, ""well, that was a total waste of money.""

Fast forward to December. I'm staring at the bottle, ""Okay, one more chance."" I spray. And... wait... is that... COFFEE? The note I actually paid for had finally decided to show up! I wasn't just in love; I was obsessed. I started wearing it daily. I became ""That Guy."" And yes, I got boo-ed at the office for it (lol). My team was not a fan of my new ""edible"" aura.

But I still wasn't getting the ""BEAST MODE"" everyone on YouTube promised. It stayed on clothes, sure, but the projection was a sad kitten.
So, I used half the bottle, then it sat on my shelf collecting dust and plotting its revenge for 8+ months.

I found it 2 days ago. The juice was dark. Like, seriously, ominously dark. It looked like it had been in the gym doing deadlifts.

I decided to test it at home. Two. Sprays.
My parents literally came in and politely evicted me from the living room. They couldn't handle the power.

It's official. I no longer have a fragrance. I have a weapon of mass olfactory destruction.

A Humble Warning from a Changed Man:
 * Don't buy this if you hate sweet, edible frags. You won't just dislike it; you'll feel personally attacked by it.
 * It's SPICY. We're talking heavy, 'cinnamon-challenge-in-a-bottle' spicy. It will give you a headache if you get trigger-happy.
 * My serious advice: Max 3 sprays. AT NIGHT ONLY. WINTERS ONLY .Do not wear this to an enclosed space unless you want to be the main character in everyone's villain story.
 * That initial blast is still a bit of a hazmat situation, but that dry down... wow.

1oqk5rp,https://www.reddit.com/r/IslamabadSocial/comments/1oqk5rp/met_a_weird_guy_in_islamabad/,Met a weird guy in Islamabad,"My house had no electricity yesterday from morning till afternoon. I needed to get some work done so I took my laptop and went to a coffee place nearby. I had been working for an hour or two when this strange man came in. There were many empty tables but he was standing and looking around for around 5 minutes. It was enough for me to notice. But, I was busy working on something and ignored. I thought he was wearing a card around his neck, but later, I realized it was a vape... A vape he hung around his neck with a strap.

After some time of being restless, he asked to sit with me. I didn't mind him sitting on the same table but I had a deliverable due at work, so didn’t engage in conversation with him. It should have been obvious to him from the start that I was very busy. He sat there, for quite some time, staring into the void while listening to music at low volume. After an hour, he tried conversing with me. I was trying to focus on my work and ignore him for the most part, but he kept going. He told me he lived in Lahore, that he was doing BBA from LUMS and came to meet all his cadet college friends in Islamabad. I was a bit confused why he seemed so alone and desperate if he had many friends here. Apparently, his friends had told him to go to this place and drink coffee… Alone. He had come to the city with his father who was an MPA and consequently, a busy man. I wasn’t sure whether he was telling the truth or trying to get my attention, or both. Told me he owned his own house in DHA 5, Lahore. At this point, I was just conversing to see how far he wanted to flex. He had lost $58,000 in crypto ever since Zohran Mamdani got elected in NYC.

I had not asked for any of this information. Did he think telling people about his dad's wealth is a good way to make friends? I wanted to know more about this eccentric guy but one thing I fear most in life is a crazy man. Here’s how I deal with them: Say very little, do not offend them and run as fast as you can. I called my dad to ask if the electricity was back. It was not. Well, I was forced to pretend it was, and decided to leave. There was no point in sitting there, I couldn't work with all his blabbering. He asked to order a coffee for me. I normally won't mind a free coffee. If only there was such a thing as a free lunch. I refused and got up to leave. He asked for my instagram, I told him I had uninstalled the app, which is true. He asked me for my snapchat, I had that uninstalled as well. Not that I would have given him anyway. He seemed desperate, but I shook hands and left.



What's interesting about this interaction is that we were both guys. Best case, he was a desperate man trying to make a friend. Average case, he was a gay man trying to hit on me. Worst case, he was actually the son of an assemblyman.",5,1762487220.0,IslamabadSocial,3,1.0,False
1oqk5mw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1oqk5mw/i_m34_matched_with_her_f43_back_in_july_i_feel/,I (M34) matched with her (F43) back in July. I feel like she's misunderstanding me. I stopped responding because she got really mean. Am I being unreasonable about what I said? [She wants to see your responses],"It started out absolutely wonderfully. Daily text messages, exciting dates, great conversations. We vibed so well together. I have my quirks, but I think I was a gentleman. I paid for dates, showed up for her, was playful, and charming. I never went in with the expectation of being entitled to anything with her. I was only focused on us having fun together, above all. And she was so sweet, kind, considerate, and understanding. On one date at a festival, she paid for me because I forgot my wallet at home. I really liked her after that.

Until things changed. Text messages from her became less frequent. Setting up dates became difficult because I wouldn't hear from her for days on end. I was understanding because her work was always demanding. She would often multitask and respond to my silly text messages. But that stopped too. For weeks. Until I felt like I was ghosted. A non response is a response. I know that that was the sign to move on. I was so confused and frustrated that something that started out so beautifully ended up with me feeling ashamed about myself. So I sent her another message because I believed that there was something there worth rescuing. We never got out of the talking stage and never declared to be in an explicit relationship.

The following is that message and what resulted from it. I'd like for you to have the full context to make an informed response, so please settle in for a long one if you have the patience.

Oct 4, 1:21PM, three days after my last message to her.

Me: Hey, (her name) If I could speak frankly, are you still interested in developing a romantic connection with me? I know you're in a bit of a rough spot right now with work and your health. I hope you can get it all in order soon. I'm questioning whether you have the time and energy to properly tend to the garden we've been trying to cultivate together. It's totally fine if you no longer are interested, and have to tend to your priorities and interests. I'm just wondering if the frequency to which we've been corresponding and the way it was been playing out lately is something I should expect in future with you.

Oct 4, 9:31PM

Her: I'm sorry. It's been a very stressful month and next month won't be any better. I apologize but my work is very demanding and I always have try harder because it supports my house and pets. I was thinking the same thing, is my work and life too busy to have relationship

Her: Like today I slept until 4pm because I was so exhausted from the week.

Oct 4, 10:26PM

Me: I do very much enjoy the time we spend together. I like you. And find myself well disposed to you.

Oct 4,10:27PM

Me: Is there a plan we could try and develop that involves us corresponding in a more fruitful and frequent manner? Because this doesn't seem like it's working.

Oct 5, 9:49PM, I message again the next day

Me: Okay. Well I think a non response is a good enough response for me that indicates that you just don't have the time, space, or focus for me to be a part of your life in a more meaningful way. Which is deeply unfortunate.

Oct 14, 9:23PM, she responds nine days later

Her: I'm sorry that you feel this way , my phone broke and I got a new one

Her: I'd make time, it's just that just recently it's been very stressful

Oct 14, 9:56PM

Me: I get that. And I believe that you would. But I think you've been making your decision already. You've been deciding for a while now, by way of how you've been interacting with me, and where you're placing your focus. You're certainly not engaged at all with this conversation anymore.

Oct 14,10:08PM

Me: I'm a believer of ""If they wanted to, they would."" It does really suck that you're dealing with your own set of difficulties right now. It's partially why asked if you're still interested in me, and if we could try and develop a new plan to further this connection in a modified fashion that would fit better with the changed landscape. And you haven't even engaged with those inquiries, which indicates to me that you can't even be bothered to. And I don't find this a suitable when cultivating a relationship, as I'm sure you wouldn't either.

Oct 14,10:12PM

Me: I don't think anyone is to blame here. Our priorities and concerns just aren't aligned together, and that's fine. If you're no longer invested in cultivating this garden with me, we can move on from each other and let it wilt away.

Oct 24, 6:52PM, I message her again ten days later

Me: I've tended to the many woes you've shared with me with an emphatic and attentive ear. Offering genuine words of encouragement with your day to day problems, and went though it with you. About the difficulties with your brother. About your various illnesses. About your many troubles with work. About your turbulent relationship with your parents. Hearing about your abusive ex. I listened because I was genuinely, curious with where you were coming from. I always wanted to hear more from you. You always had so much to say, and I listened to you go on and speak your mind because I wanted you to feel that you were being heard. It just baffles me that the one time I make myself vulnerable to you and ask to be heard, it gets me ghosted. I just can't believe that this is the nature of how people choose to conduct their interactions now. You can just tell me outright that this brief connection we had is no longer feasible for you. It's really not that big of a deal. I can take rejection, and it would be the considerate thing to do. Instead of ghosting me, leaving me to stumble blindly around in the dark questioning my worth, and feeling ashamed about myself.

Oct 25, 2:53PM, she responds the next day

Her: As of late, I have been dealing with quite a bit of stress from work and family, and all of that has transpired into becoming physically ill. Also, October is always a hard month for me. It is the anniversary of my mom's passing here in a few days., even though it's been six years; it feels like yesterday. But I believe you've also made the decision for us...and I don't want you to feel like you're ghosted but I came to the impression that me being older was a concern of yours and I started getting the impression that I don't fit in your description of an ideal partner.

Oct 25, 2:57PM

Her: I cannot help that I'm older and I also can't help there certain things that you listed as values in a partner I don't coincide with. I find it odd that if there's any kind of conflict, in your description, I would not be allowed to share my concerns with a friend. I've always felt that relationships are organic, and there has to be chemistry and understanding there. but I started getting the impression that you are looking for someone younger

Her: And as of late, I've been dealing with a lot of work stress and I have to go out of town for it, so I honestly didn't know what to say.

Oct 25, 3:07PM

Me: You're misunderstood. I really don't know where you're getting these impressions of me. None of the things you listed are things I believe in.

Oct 25, 3:09PM

Me: Anyway, please just focus on taking care of yourself and your own health. I don't want to be a contributing factor to your already pressing hardships. It's okay. I made a fumbling play for your heart and it just didn't work out in a good way. Don't worry about it.

Oct 25, 3:14PM

Her: Do you remember our coffee date where we sat and talked, he said, what are you looking for a partner because you are older... I was kind of shocked at the question and didn't know that me being older was an issue

Oct 25, 3:15PM

Her: And then I could tell you were getting frustrated when we started going over your list of an ideal partner. especially your version of what sex appeal is, which I gathered was you'd always have to look your best for your significant other... when a life that is not always the case

Her: Again, I started gathering that I don't think I fit into what you consider an ideal partner...

Oct 25, 3:33PM

Me: Yes I do remember. I think you might have misheard me. I didn't ask you that question. When I told my older sister about you, she asked ME that question. That question was asked to me by my sister, and I relayed what she said to you because you were curious about what she thought about you. And her asking that wasn't because she, or I for that matter, had any issue about any impression of age you may have developed. Briefly after, you asked me outright if your age was an issue and I said no, not in the least. I think maybe you're in your head about that. I saw your age when I first matched with you. It wasn't an issue for me.

Oct 25, 3:43PM

Me: No, I wasn't getting frustrated. I was actually really engaged and enjoying our date at the coffee shop, and that you were allowing me an open space to explain the reasoning behind why I have certain boundaries. Again, I have no issues whatsoever about a partner talking with whomever they want about their relationship concerns. I don't know where you are developing the impression that I would want my partner to do that, because I never believed in that. My sticking point is when a partner intentionally bad mouths their partner to others. There is nothing to gain constructively by doing that, and it builds more resentment in a relationship that's already doomed if that's the way a partner talks about their relationship. I don't think partners should do that when confiding in others because it's not helpful.

Oct 25, 3:52PM

Her: You stated ""Not just in matters of being strictly monogamous, but also in matters of how we communicate our relationship with others. Someone who will not casually badmouth our relationship to others or speak ill of each other behind each others backs. Better more, they celebrate our relationship and sing it's praises to anyone and everyone.""

And I believe no one intentionally wants a bad mouth, their partner behind each other's backs, and I think sing praises is a little extreme.

Oct 25, 3:57PM

Her: Also, you stated this"" And finally, someone who has sex appeal. Which is to say, someone who actively takes care of them self physically, mentally, spiritually, as well as their belongings. Someone who will work to make themselves to appear as attractive as possible to me, and continue to work to do so. I'm more partial to women whom dress modestly in public, but ultimately outside of blatantly revealing clothing and torn rags I don't really mind how she dresses in public.”

And this statement you stated they have to ""appear as attractive as possible to me, and continue to work to do so."" to this I ask, why wouldn't anyone want to appear their best, but in the same breath, not everyone feels at their best, so they are not going to per se get dolled up to fill this requirement

Here is the context to what she is referring to, discussed earlier in our message exchanges.

Aug 27, 11:15AM

Me: As for me, fundamentally I'm looking for 5 main things, which splinter off into different subcategories. Firstly, someone who tells the truth. She has to be someone I can rely on and trust, a consistent character I can confide in, someone I can make myself vulnerable to, has the integrity and strength of character to correct me when I become misaligned, and knows how to say ""no"" and mean it. More important, I don't want her to lie to herself about what she wants out of the relationship.

Next would be someone who has loyalty. Not just in matters of being strictly monogamous, but also in matters of how we communicate our relationship with others. Someone who will not casually badmouth our relationship to others or speak ill of each other behind each others backs. Better more, they celebrate our relationship and sing it's praises to anyone and everyone. They also have respect in leaving disgruntled matters strictly private between us with the belief that we will both actively work to solve any issues we have together.

Next is someone who will be happy to develop a shared vision for the future with me that will improve our lives. Still having her own individual goals, but also having a shared goal with me, and the means to strategize and plan with me in meeting them.

Then someone who is romantic, and understands that in our busy world nowadays that romance often htad to be planned for. It can't always be spontaneous anymore, So someone who is patient in planning dates and get togethers to set up the preconditions for romance to materialize, and to do it over and over again until we've mastered it.

Aug 27, 11:19AM

Me: And finally, someone who has sex appeal. Which is to say, someone who actively takes care of them self physically, mentally, spiritually, as well as their belongings. Someone who will work to make themselves to appear as attractive as possible to me, and continue to work to do so. I'm more partial to women whom dress modestly in public, but ultimately outside of blatantly revealing clothing and torn rags I don't really mind how she dresses in public.

Context part over. Back to main.

Her: It seemed super far fetched, not everyone functions in a happy state all the time, and when you're depressed or sad, you're definitely not going to do things to be appealing to your partner, you're going to be doing things that make you feel better

Her: Also, why wouldn't anybody wanna take the best care of themselves physically mentally and spiritually, everyone is looking for inner peace

Oct 25, 4:03PM

Me: Unfortunately, I don't agree with that. People far more often bad mouth their partners than take any personal accountability. It's a symptom of a much broader issue that doesn't just sit inside the context of a relationship. The culture of being blameless, blaming the other political party, blaming the other gender, blaming the other educational institutions, blaming the other country, is all around us.

Oct 25, 4:04PM

Me: I don't think there's anything extreme about singing the praises of a successful relationship. Why wouldn't you want to signpost your healthy relationship and set a good example for other's to emulate?

Oct 25, 4:15PM

Her: See that is where we don't agree, you're coming from a stance where every partner will always badmouth you behind your back. That is not the case you might've had one bad encounter, but that doesn't mean everyone is like that.

Oct 25, 4:16PM

Her: Also, don't you think singing praises is a little extreme?, How would one sing praises if you are in conflict?... again every relationship will have their highs and lows, and most people's relationships only highlight the positive for social media likes... no one talks about the bad issues... so I feel both should be highlighted... otherwise you live in a false reality

Oct 25, 4:33PM

Me: No that's incorrect because we are in agreement. I don't think everyone is like that and never said they are. I just said that people far often more likely will do so because the culture promotes being a victim. Far often more is not always, and I know this because I don't do it myself. And we already discussed that I do not know whether or not my previous partners have ever bad mouthed me, so I do not have any personal encounters with it. Again, this is a matter of me stating the reasoning behind why I have these boundaries beforehand, and I don't think there is anything wrong with verbalizing what you don't want in a relationship. I think the issue is coming from you assuming that I would think that way of my partner. I don't want my partner to cheat on me either, and I'd want to be comfortable with telling my partner that that's a boundary of mines without them assuming I think they WILL cheat on me. I don't walk to be physically or emotionally abused either. Stating so doesn't mean I'm accusing them of doing so.

Oct 25, 4:35PM

Me: If you're in a relationship with conflict, why would you be singing it's praises? You wouldn't be.

Oct 25, 4:37PM

Me: I agree. Both should be highlighted, good and bad. But again, doing so by bad mouthing and using hateful language about your partner isn't useful. There's already enough hateful bashing going around.

Oct 25, 4:39PM

Her: But see you are generalizing without knowing the person

Oct 25, 4:40PM

Me: I feel like you're making a lot of assumptions about me that I don't believe it. You're taking what I say and re-materializing it with your own thinking without actually asking me what I believe or mean.

Oct 25, 4:41PM

Me: I'm not generalizing. I'm stating my boundaries; what I do and do not want.

Her: But if you never knew your partners badmouth you, why would you have set a boundary unless if you knew something?, It's kind of common sense in a relationship to not to badmouth people behind their back and just be upfront and forward. I don't think there's nothing wrong with verbalizing what you want in a relationship, it sets boundaries.

Oct 25, 4:43PM

Her: And people cheat if their ideals are flawed. I wouldn't do that, I would tell you hey it's over, before I move on.

Oct 25, 4:46PM

Her: I don't believe I'm re-materializing anything you're verbiage is just quite clear and you keep circling back on the idea that your partner will cheat on you and badmouth you behind your back... see what I'm getting from you is that you have already an idea that people will do wrong to you, and stated the boundary that cheating is wrong, which it is is, no one wants to be cheated on.

Oct 25, 4:49PM

Me: Because I don't need to have experienced something first hand for it to be something I don't want to put up with. I do not need to be a professional chef to know that this anchovy chowder I'm eating is gross. Even though it's common sense as you believe, I don't think there's anything accusatory with verbalizing it as a boundary you don't want. It's common sense not to cheat on your partner too. I'm not accusing my partner of anything by saying that I don't want to be cheated on.

Me: I'm not getting that idea. YOU are getting that idea, independent of what I'm saying.

Oct 25, 4:51PM

Her: I understand the boundaries that you've outlined our universal, no one wants to be cheated on, people want to live in a monogamous relationship, people should be able to communicate freely without feeling of bad mouthing behind someone's back.

Her: Well yeah, ok I think we are done here. I think we know where we stand. I don't need to sit here and argue with you about this.

Me: Your issue is that you think I am assuming these things about my partner by stating my them. I'm not. You're misunderstood.

Oct 25, 4:54PM

Her: I'm not assuming, your stating

Her: You're pointing out an obvious rule when two people are in a relationship.

Oct 25, 4:56PM

Me: I've been entirely on the defensive. I'm defending myself against your incorrect assumptions about what I value in a relationship. You've been arguing with an avatar in your head that you've created about what you think you believe I am saying based on your own experience. You are not affording my the charitable benefit of the doubt and are assuming compete ill intent.

Oct 25, 4:57PM

Me: I will always assume that I am wrong, have been ill advised, and am just being stupid. That's just who I am, because I'm not the smartest.

Her: Well, the thing is how about you verbatim send your text that you sent to me to one of your friends that it's a girl and see their reaction Especially about the sex appeal...

Me: I think you are having a confrontational issue with your own pride and ego. You don't want to admit that maybe you're misunderstanding, or wrong.

Oct 25, 5:00PM

Me: By that same notion, I'd encourage you to do the same and send that text to one of your friends that is a guy and see their reaction.

Oct 25, 5:04PM

Me: There's nothing wrong with you not finding these things to be suitable to your liking. That's fine. But I believe that you coming to your conclusions on a false premise. So yeah, I'm going to defend myself if you're going to attack me. Because I believe you're entirely misunderstanding what I'm saying and do not want to confront your own sense of pride in recognizing that maybe you're wrong in your assumptions, and are not affording me the charitable benefit of the doubt.

Oct 25, 5:09PM

Me: You're obviously still dealing with a lot at the moment, and this back and forth is not constructive. And is probably making you feel worse. If you aren't going to engage with me with the same sense of humility and intellectual charity that I have afford to you throughout our entire connection so far, unfortunately that's a point of acrimony we will not be able to bridge.

Oct 25, 5:11PM

Me: You have a dark cloud that is following you right now. A silent strom that has been hurtful and heart wrenching to me. Please take your dark cloud and get off my rainbow. Take it WAY over there.

Oct 25, 5:28PM

Her: Well, I'm just communicating and you're trying to pick a fight and make assumptions

Oct 25, 5:40PM

Her: It's not a pride/ego thing. And I did send your text to a guy, like help explain where he's coming from. Even he was like I would not say that nor think it.

Her: And you to realize you engaged in a conversation that I thought we were no longer discussing, I think you already came to the conclusion that we are not compatible so why would you text me today only to pick a fight

Her: You need to take your dark cloud away

I did not respond and this is now where I'm at.

That was almost a week ago. I gave it some time, and did a lot of self reflecting since then. Some introspection, contemplation, and thinking about other ways I could have handled things. I've just gotten so many mixed signals now. She's busy with work and other commitments, understood. She's fallen ill, understood. Text messages became less frequent, understood. Me having a willingness to develop a workable plan around her busy schedule so that we can try and grow new flowers in what became a desert, I get ghosted. Voicing my concerns, she said she would make time if she could. I ask again if she's still interested, she doesn't want me to feel like I'm being ghosted. But also, now she thinks that I believe she isn't an ideal partner for me. Now, she think's that I'm the one that decided the connection we had isn't feasible anymore. Now, it's about her thinking our age gap is an issue when I explicitly stated it was not. Now, it's about the misalignment of what we value in a relationship. Now, it's about me making myself vulnerable, and opening myself up to be heard being misconstrued as ""picking a fight."" So many crossed wires. Where is the truth? Maybe all of these are probably true, at the same time. Maybe she just needed to rip the band aid off, and it took a bit of poking for her to finally come out with it.

I could have never told her what I value in relationships, or never talked about my boundaries. I felt like these things were incorrectly weaponized against me, to disqualify me. But thinking in that way isn't helpful. She said to send those messages to a female friend of mines, but that already establishes a bias in my favor. I think a better aggregate of insights about this situation would come from a pool of people not involved in any way with me. Fundamentally, I just want to understand if I'm misunderstanding this situation.

And so finally, with all that context, I ask you: Am I the one that's mistaken? Is what I want and value in a relationship unreasonable? Is she mistaken, or misunderstanding? Is anything that was shared in the text exchange questionable? Am I unaware of any questions I should be asking you? Anything else?

Final Notes

Please be respectful. She is a very sweet and warm hearted woman, and if she does decide to read through this, I don't want her to feel bad.

I do not think that I am blameless in this situation, because I know that I'm stupid. I do not want to be seen as a victim that gets advocated for simply because I'm asking for your insights. Give my words as much a critical lens as you would hers.

Again, I know. A non response is a response heard loud and clear, and I should have just cut my losses and moved on when I didn't hear back from her. I know. We've maneuvered beyond that, so calling it as such doesn't really provide much utility.

I do believe that she is rigid in admitting that she may be misunderstanding me, and may have difficulty with confronting her ego and sense of pride. That is my current stance. If I could be so bold to make my own assumption, she works in a VERY competitive field that is male dominated. Her adopting a confrontational and questioning orientation must have been very beneficial for her in a competitive, male dominated field of work. Maybe that's what I was faced with, which is totally fine. I'm not one to judge how anyone conducts their manner of voice. But I just think it's unreasonable to disqualify me over what I think is a grave misunderstanding, that is being walled off because of a perceived inability to confront her own pride. She is older than me, so I can admit that maybe I'm just less learned and punching above my own weight, and that I have less experience in navigating different social dynamics than she does. I can totally recognize that my manner of communication is currently malformed. She is very intelligent, gainfully employed, and successful. And I am, well, me.

I would highly encourage you, dear Redditor, to ask any questions you may have about this situation, within respectable fashion. I'd be happy to answer any questions, or add more context for you to have a more developed picture of the series of events as they played out.

TLDR: Feels like what I value in a relationship is being misunderstood by her. She doesn't think she's misunderstanding. What do you think?

1oqk5g1,https://i.redd.it/btgkytjfarzf1.png,How Your Name Builds Brands and Cults,"# Case Study:

Top consultancies and market researchers show that name-based personalization, like Starbucks' cup naming strategy, consistently delivers revenue lift ranging from 5% to as high as 40%, depending on execution and sector. McKinsey research specifically cites a typical 10–15% increase in revenue for brands advancing personalized interactions, with best-in-class companies occasionally hitting a 25–40% uplift.

# Key Findings from Studies

McKinsey: Personalization drives 10–15% average revenue lift, with some companies reporting 5–25% lifts based on sector and implementation quality.

Deloitte: Brands excelling at personalization exceed revenue goals due to customers buying more, more often, and remaining loyal over time.

Industry Marketing Analysis: Mature personalization programs—such as using customer names—can contribute up to a 40% revenue increase versus competitors with less tailored service.

Specific to Starbucks: The company credited the return of handwritten names as a key driver in beating quarterly revenue expectations, with its CEO attributing the lift in customer café visits and sales directly to the personalized cup strategy linked to renewed emotional touchpoints.

Summary Table: Revenue Lift from Name-Based Personalization

||
||
|Study/Report|Revenue Lift Estimate|Sector/Context|
|McKinsey (2021–2024)|10–15% (avg); up to 40%|Retail, F&B, Consumer Goods|
|Deloitte (2024)|Soaring past revenue goals|Cross-industry|
|Marketing Stats (2025)|Up to 40%|Mature programs (retail/e-commerce)|
|Starbucks CEO (2025)|Quarterly revenue beat|In-store / QSR sales|

These metrics demonstrate that personalizing the experience with a customer's name transforms not just the customer's mood but also a company's financial performance, validating a clear ROI for name-based personalization efforts.

# THE STARBUCKS EFFECT

# Impact on Loyalty and Retention

Research and behavioral studies have shown that companies excelling at personalization, such as Starbucks, see up to 40% higher revenue growth compared to their competitors—largely because personalized service fosters repeat business and greater customer engagement. In Starbucks' case, this contributed to a retention rate as high as 44%, compared to an industry average of 25%. Customers who felt personally acknowledged built stronger emotional ties with the brand.

Starbucks started writing customers' names on coffee cups as part of a deliberate strategy to personalize the experience, build emotional connection, and reduce errors during busy periods. The idea originated around 2011 from a barista's effort to improve customer satisfaction, then was formalized and rolled out globally in 2012 as a way to foster ""first-name basis"" relationships and make each order less transactional.

# Human-Centric Approach

Putting names on cups is a classic example of human-centric design in service: it communicates individual recognition and transforms the interaction into a personalized moment. By calling a customer by name, Starbucks positions itself as a brand that values people rather than just sales.

# Operational and Marketing Benefits

This policy also helps baristas keep orders organized and reduce mix-ups, especially during rush hours. Beyond practical benefits, the tactic created a cultural buzz—with misspelled names and personalized messages fueling viral social media content, turning customers into inadvertent marketers. It's considered by many as an ingenious blend of customer experience and word-of-mouth marketing.

# Branding and Emotional Impact

Starbucks has used name writing to foster community, spark conversations, and make customer visits memorable, reinforcing brand loyalty even as critics debate its authenticity and practicality on a large scale. Overall, this small gesture became a signature part of Starbucks' global brand identity and customer engagement strategy.

# Crazy Fact

Charles Manson famously used Dale Carnegie's self-help book ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" to develop many of the psychological manipulation tactics that he later employed in leading his cult, the so-called Manson Family. While imprisoned before the notorious murders, Manson took a course based on Carnegie's book and learned techniques in persuasion, influence, and charisma, which he applied to recruit and control his followers.

Biographer Jeff Guinn explicitly cited Carnegie's influence and Manson's use of these techniques in prison as a catalyst for his metamorphosis from small-time criminal to cult leader.

Key point Manson learned was: ""Use the name of the people to make them feel special and personal.""

# Conclusion

""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" taught Manson strategies for winning people's trust, reading emotions, and influencing behavior, and these skills became central to his ability to create a devoted following.

Starbucks is using similar techniques to bring followers to their brand.

But wait, before you dismiss this technological underdog, think about the possibilities!

For the less tech-savvy, this tablet is a miracle worker. Want to look impressive at family gatherings? Pull out this sleek device, tap the screen confidently, and boom! You’re suddenly the Elon Musk of your retirement party, regardless of how many times you search ""how to print.""

Need a hot dish coaster? The Lenovo tablet’s got your back. Dinner parties, desk lunches, or spontaneous ramen sessions. No more ring stains on your heirloom coffee table!

Enjoy reading ebooks? It’s got you covered. Just as long as you don’t mind a little digital suspense. Page turns may lag, but think of it as dramatic tension. Who knew Dostoevsky would be even more thrilling with a five-second delay?

How slow is it?

You can tap to open an app, go make a pot of coffee, come back, and it might just be ready for you.​

It’s so slow, even sloths have reached inbox zero before it finishes loading Gmail.​

How slow? If you head out for a brisk walk, you’ll return just in time for the tablet’s home screen to finish its stretching routine.​

For my first project I figured I'd try to redo an old coffee table. I decided to work on the legs first, which are contoured. So I sanded all the finish off with 80 grit, went all the way up to 220 grit. I wet and cleaned the wood between each grit. After the last grit, I cleaned it with denatured alcohol so as not to pop the fibers. Then I applied a water-based pre-conditioner with a nylon brush, waited an hour and a half, then tried to stain. I wiped the stain off with a microfiber cloth after about 2 minutes. It came out so blotchy! I knew I'd have to sand it all down again anyway, so I decided to experiment on a leg I hadn't touched yet. I tried a slip coat of mineral spirits underneath instead of the preconditioner, but that seemed to give it a whitish appearance once it started to dry. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. This is the second attempt on this thing and no matter what I try it seems to be the same result. I think it's the contours making it so uneven.

Even green tea sent me over the edge to spiraltown. Pretty common according to PAWS research, which further convinces me that is the case.

Granted, the severity isn't like it was when I tried this over a month ago, but holy shit kids, its like adding a gallon of gas to a lit match.

I'd say yes to every social invite, keep myself constantly busy with plans and people, then feel completely drained and resentful every single time. I figured I was just bad at socializing or maybe broken somehow.

Eventually I realized it wasn't a social skills issue, it was what I'd call an energy depletion issue. My presence felt weak because I was constantly leaking energy into every interaction, every obligation, every person who demanded my attention. So instead of trying to force myself to be more extroverted, I started protecting my energy through intentional solitude BEFORE I hit burnout.

Now I schedule literally sacred alone time every single day. Mornings are completely mine - no calls, no texts, no scrolling, just me and silence. I'll go for walks without headphones, sit with coffee without distractions, journal without performing for anyone. I basically recharge in solitude so the rest of my day I can actually show up as my full self. The more time I spend alone, the stronger my presence becomes around others.

Then I switched from constant availability to strategic socializing. Instead of being accessible 24/7 and saying yes to everything, I'm selective about when and with whom I spend energy. Quality over quantity. I show up fully present for fewer people rather than being half-present for everyone. Way less energy drain when interactions are intentional.

The final thing that shifted everything was noticing how different I felt after solitude versus after being constantly around people. After alone time, I felt grounded, clear, almost magnetic. After too much socializing, I felt scattered, depleted, like a dimmer version of myself. That awareness made solitude non-negotiable instead of something I felt guilty about.

That combo of daily solitude, selective socializing, and awareness of my energy has completely changed my presence. People literally comment that I seem different - more confident, more centered, more ""there."" It's not that I became more charismatic. I just stopped scattering my energy everywhere and started cultivating it in silence.",6,1762486619.0,emotionalintelligence,0,1.0,False

I’m putting together a one-day finance-focused conference in Dubai for **mid-April 2026** and looking for **premium venues** that can host around **80–100 professional guests** (think investment and trading professionals).

**Budget:** Around **50,000 AED** total — ideally covering the venue hire, basic AV, and catering.

**Here’s what we need:**

* **Date:** One day between **13th**, **20th**, or **27th** **April 2026** (flexible)
* **Format:** • 1 keynote session • 2–3 content-led panel discussions (topics like AI, market structure, technical trading) • Networking breaks, buffet lunch, and an evening drinks reception
* **Schedule:** 9:00 AM – 6:30 PM (including reception)

**Venue setup requirements:**

* Main room, theatre-style for \~100 guests with **stage, lectern, projector/screen, AV support (lapel + handheld mics)**
* **Breakout or networking area** for coffee breaks, lunch, and sponsor tables
* Optional small room for **private sponsor meetings**
* **Catering:** arrival coffee, mid-morning & afternoon breaks, lunch, and evening drinks
* Ideally, capacity for up to **120 guests** in case registration exceeds target

We’re aiming to **finalize the venue by early December 2025**, so I’m shortlisting now.

Would really appreciate any **recommendations for hotels or venues** that fit this profile — ideally ones that:

* Have strong corporate/event teams
* Offer **reasonable day delegate packages** or **minimum spends** around 50k AED
* Provide solid **AV and catering** setups

Places like Meydan, Address, Jumeirah, or Ritz-Carlton come to mind — but open to other suggestions too.

My issue is that I drink around 2 1/2 cups (650 ml or 22 ounces) or coffee in the morning, made all at once in my french press. I get up very early and don't have time to make separate cups of pour over. Is there a system that would allow me to make my usual amount of coffee at once? Or could I place something like the V60 on top of my french press carafe?

Also, I have a good quality burr grinder. What grind setting is recommended for pour over and should I use more or less coffee than the equivalent amount for a french press?

1oqjup9,https://www.reddit.com/r/studyAbroad/comments/1oqjup9/studied_abroad_had_the_time_of_my_life_and_built/,"Studied abroad, had the time of my life, and built a travel app about it","Hey Reddit, I’m Ellie (21F). Sorry for invading your feed, but I’m working on something I care about a lot, and I think some of you might relate as to why.

I studied abroad in Beijing last year for a language immersion program and had an absolute blast. My Chinese friends showed me around all these amazing spots and hidden gems I never would have found on my own. I truly felt like I was living Chinese culture, not just observing it from the outside. It's one thing to visit a place, but to truly experience it is completely another thing.

After my time in China, I did a tour around East Asia with my best friend I made in the program. She had some free time and had very similar travel interests and style as I did (night markets, temples, street food). We had the most amazing time together. She was the best travel buddy ever.

I was lucky that I was in a study abroad program that guided me, but I want to be able to have experiences like that again when I’m on my own, and I want you to be able to have them too.

Nowadays it's easy to book flights, find hotels, and look up what to see on TripAdvisor. But it's still incredibly hard to actually connect with a place and its people in a meaningful way. You show up, follow the tourist guidebook, take the photos, and leave feeling like you barely scratched the surface. You saw everything but experienced nothing.

What I'm always searching for—and maybe you are too:

* **Real local life.** The cafés where people get their morning coffee, the parks where families hang out on weekends. Places that locals actually go to, to see the way they actually live. Be around people who show me around their hidden favorite spots.
* **Someone who travels the way I do**. Who cares about the same things I care about. Who wants to spend hours getting lost in used bookstores and local libraries. Who's down to hunt for the best street food at 11pm. Who gets genuinely excited about a random historical plaque or a jazz bar tucked down an alley.
* **That perfect travel companion energy.** You know that feeling when you meet someone and just click? When you can walk around a city for hours without it feeling awkward, or sit in comfortable silence watching the sunset, or suddenly decide to chase down a street festival you just heard about?

But how do you find these people and places? Right now, you can't. So you compromise. You go alone and deal with the loneliness, or you join some overpriced cookie-cutter tour where everything is planned down to the minute and you never get to deviate from the script.

Neither option gives you what travel should be about: genuine connection and authentic discovery.

That's why I'm building Nomigo.

First, it connects you with travelers and locals who actually match your interests, your pace, your curiosity. People you'd actually want to spend time with.

Then it uses AI to build itineraries around local spots that align with what you care about. Not ""top 10 must-sees"" but the jazz clubs locals love, the markets where people actually shop, the galleries people enjoy. All the hidden spots that make a city special to the people who live there.

Next time you travel, I want you to be able to experience your own version of Tokyo, Paris, and Rome. Connect with people and places that make those cities come alive. Create your own unforgettable, irreplaceable stories. I want to make travel feel like yours.

In the end, what matters is who you walked all over Rome with. The person you stayed up talking to until sunrise. Coming home with stories about people and moments, not just photos of buildings.

If this sounds like something you've been looking for too, DM me. The app will be released very soon and will be free. I may be biased, but I'm in love with this app and I want to help redefine how people travel and experience the world. 

Ok sorry for the long post lol I hope you are as excited as I am!

**And Sleep paralysis.**  
  
**Sleeping much longer than usual (eleven hours or more) but still feeling very sleepy and having trouble staying awake during the day. Daytime naps not making him feel more alert or rested, Trouble focusing or concentrating.**

**I nod my head that makes since. I continue, why you love sleep so much. He replies, in death there is freedom. Sleep is so close to death we only or trapped when we wake up. In death there is no skin no flesh, no physical limits. In sleep it’s the same you operate from your spirit.**

**Everything made since all my questions were answered. All the universal secrets were revealed to me. It was bliss and ecstasy all in one. When I turned around my eye flashed gray and I woke up in the dark. I have tried to find the sun again to get back my vision.**  
  
**You see doctor the only way I see is when I sleep do you understand. I replied,  I want to believe you sir. But unfortunately you can't show me so I will have to say they or hallucinations.**

**I say not if I'm going to lose my mind. He says but what will you gain??? all knowledge. Nope I'm good I said. He says come with me please.**  
**We don't have to see the sun I can show you the one know as God.**  
  
**I chuckled yea that's rich; No one can do that unless God wills it. The patient says what if I told you there was a way. I would say you or full of it.**  
  
**Ok bring a Matronome and come back tomorrow any time, get these restraints of me and I will show you how to fly.**

**He says look up, relax your body. Let your body weight go. Listen to the tick**

**and focus on the tock. Just listen, just focus. As I stared up and relaxed his voice began to fade. The roof began to open the clouds in the sky started to move.** 

 

**Out of nowhere, Mr. Jackson’s voice shouted, AND UP. Instantly I started floating towards the opening in the roof. I felt weightless, almost like water.  It was amazing. I went through the roof.  The sun light was so beautiful; I’ve never seen the sun like this before. Of course I wasn’t looking straight at it. I could see people but not like black and white people.**

 

**But like vessels with translucent skin holding a beautiful light inside them. Some lights or brighter than others. Wow the colors or amazing, I wish we could see each other like this. Mr. Anthony is floating next to me. Something is wrong He has no light.**

 

**He looks at me with a big smile and says go higher touch the sun. Some type of way he grabs my translucent body. Then he zooms toward the sun. I start to burn he says can you feel it doctor. Let’s have a peek; the sun had to be right in front of me. He grabs my neck and pushes me towards the sun.  He begins to squeeze me, he whispers open your eyes or ill snatch your essence.**

 

**I was so afraid so I opened my eyes. Everything a lined it was beautiful. It’s like my mind was unlocked. There was nothing that was hidden from me, the universe unlocked everything. I felt perfect, and then it happened the gray flash and then Total darkness.**

**I get it now, why did I not see it at first. The only way I can see now is if I dream. I feel trapped like I lost a piece of me.  Now all I want do is sleep. If I’m awake, IM trapped I need to be free, I need to sleep.**

I follow them, and if they follow me back, then I’ll like a post if it’s recent and maybe follow with a “hey” or “hi” in the DM — simple and respectful, always.

So recently, I got a message from a girl (19F) who was mad at me for apparently trying to text “multiple people she knew” and said I was giving a strange vibe.

Mind you, the only conversation I have had with this lady was us catching up on life very vaguely since middle school.
Since I’ve been through a lot, it would be a whole load to say in messages, so I said, “Hey, why don’t we catch up better in person at like a coffee shop or something? It’ll just be easier to communicate in person.”

Well, she makes up an excuse on why she couldn’t do that, and I instantly noticed. So I obviously say, “Y’know, that’s all good, it’s fine — I’m glad you’re doing well and I wish you the best in life.”
Basically, just wishing her well as an old friend, since I honestly plan on never really talking to her again.

She just seemed to be a little standoffish when I respectfully floated the idea of just catching up in person at a local coffee shop or something.

I’m just wondering — am I being an asshole by trying to meet people, or was it just this one girl’s particular mindset?

When she messaged me a few days later mad about me texting people she knew, she almost made it seem like I was some weird, creepy guy — when I have never once spoken sexually at all to anyone since my last relationship, which lasted over a year.

After that relationship, I also swore to celibacy, so I’m not quite sure why she seems to think I’m so creepy.

**Mr. Jackson Ex military special forces, forty-three years old five foot seven, one hundred ninety-five pounds is showing definite signs of Hypersomnia.**  
  
**Side effects of hypersomnia can include, Anxiety, irritability. Constant or repeated episodes of extreme sleepiness during the day, Decreased energy. Difficulty waking up in the morning or after daytime naps (“sleep drunkenness”)**  
  
  
**Feeling confused or angry when waking up, Hallucinations, Headaches, Loss of appetite, Memory problems, Restlessness**  
**And Sleep paralysis.**  
  
**Sleeping much longer than usual (eleven hours or more) but still feeling very sleepy and having trouble staying awake during the day. Daytime naps not making him feel more alert or rested, Trouble focusing or concentrating.**  
  
  
**Mr. Jackson has been under the care of a well decorated psychiatrist,**  
**Dr. Anderson. According to the notes here Mr. Jackson says sleep is the real world we only get glimpse of because we or trapped. When we sleep we or free. When we awake we become trapped again.**  
  
**According to Dr. Anderson there was no child hood trauma no abuse, just too much love for sleep. Upon attending to Mr. Jackson for several months the psychiatrist just up and quit.**

**Mr. Jackson is currently in a mental institution that is very strong in the art of persuading people to snap out of what they have going on. When nine AM rolls around, I make it on time to see Mr. Jackson.**  
  
**Arriving at the mental hospital, I was informed that Mr. Jackson had to be issued several bags of IV fluid because the pills dehydrated him extremely. He broke into the medicine office and took too much sleeping medicine.**  
  
**After being awakened he exhibited violent behavior towards the staff nurses, security and doctors. Because of his extensive combat training background. They had to restrain him in a drastic way to insure the safety of not just staff but other patients.**  
  
**I was lead to a tall white building with double doors with no glass.  Just plain doors, as I walked in there was no outside light in there. No windows at all just overhead dim lights.**  
  
**We walked pass a bunch of steel doors with no windows or visible latches. My escort pulled out his IPad, checked the camera to see if the patient was still restrained. He typed in a code and the C02 compressed steel door opened.**  
  
**Mr. Jackson was mounted to a wall with metal holders and huge bolts with his head down. There was a table in the middle of the room and two chairs.**  
  
**I walk in and sat, he doesn't even look up at me. I speak Mr. Jackson my name is doctor Rowland. I'm here to listen to you explain to me why you love sleep more than life itself.**  
  
**The patient does not move, I reply I cannot take the proper steps to help you if you will not communicate with me sir. His head lifts, his matted neck length red hair sways. His face is cleanly shaved. He opens his eyes they or pale. I look and as if on cue with both say you’re blind.**  
  
**His voice is raspy and dry like he drank too much whisky. From the looks of him he was no longer one hundred ninety-five three pounds. He looks more along the lines of one twenty-seven.**  
  
**I said have they been feeding you properly. He says, I eat sparingly so I can sleep longer. I say, wouldn't eating help you sleep more. He shakes his head, the medicine I receive, does not work with food to relax me. It gives me more of a rush to keep me awake.**  
  
**I nod my head that makes since. I continue, why you love sleep so much. He replies, in death there is freedom. Sleep is so close to death we only or trapped when we wake up. In death there is no skin no flesh, no physical limits. In sleep it’s the same you operate from your spirit.**  
  
**We can fly become invisible be what we want while we sleep. I have traveled to far places. Universes that should not exist interacted with beings beyond comprehension all because of sleep.**  
  
**I reply so these dreams you have, he abruptly cuts me off there not dreams. These or real experiences, I have knowledge from places that would fry your little brain like scramble egg doctor.**  
  
**I speak again, so these experiences you believe or real. What proof do you have??? Mr. Jackson replied my eyes, he says before you judge me. Listen to my story; I discovered my gift as young boy about ten years old.**  
  
**When I slept I could fly to places that I would see on T.V. One day I ask my mother how hot was the sun and could I touch it. She told me if I got close enough only two things would happen, I would go blind or burn up maybe both.**  
  
**So being a young curios boy when I slept. I flew straight up through the ceiling in to the sky towards the sun.**  
 **I looked at first but the light burned my eyes so I closed them. But I kept going up, the closer I got the hotter it became.**  
  
**I must have got to close because my skin started to sting like fire ants were all over me. In the mist of the pain, I opened my eyes and looked at the sun. It was so beautiful I think I saw the face of the creator in there. Officially I stared at it for ten seconds and for those ten seconds everything became**

 **Aligned.**  
  
**Everything made since all my questions were answered. All the universal secrets were revealed to me. It was bliss and ecstasy all in one. When I turned around my eye flashed gray and I woke up in the dark. I have tried to find the sun again to get back my vision.**  
  
**You see doctor the only way I see is when I sleep do you understand. I replied,  I want to believe you sir. But unfortunately you can't show me so I will have to say they or hallucinations.**  
  
**The man smiles but I can show you doctor. I tried to show my last doctor, but they saw something along the flight and woke up and they never came back they never were the same. He says doctor would you like to see the sun????**  
  
**I say not if I'm going to lose my mind. He says but what will you gain??? all knowledge. Nope I'm good I said. He says come with me please.**  
**We don't have to see the sun I can show you the one know as God.**  
  
**I chuckled yea that's rich; No one can do that unless God wills it. The patient says what if I told you there was a way. I would say you or full of it.**  
  
**Ok bring a Matronome and come back tomorrow any time, get these restraints of me and I will show you how to fly.**  
  
**I leave; I go about the rest of my day normally. It’s not till I get home that I start to wonder. Can we as humans really do what he says while sleep? I decided for professional reasons I would ablodge him.**  
  
**The next day I called in a favor to set up a meeting with him and have him UN shackled and put in a private room so I can learn to fly.**  
  
**The time came six PM. In a private room with a Matronome and a UN shackled man who claims to fly. He pulls two pills from his pocket. He takes one and says you take one. Me being a smart ass says, why can't I fly without the pill.  Mr. Anthony says ok suit yourself he takes it.**  
**He says look up, relax your body. Let your body weight go. Listen to the tick**

**and focus on the tock. Just listen, just focus. As I stared up and relaxed his voice began to fade. The roof began to open the clouds in the sky started to move.** 

 

**Out of nowhere, Mr. Jackson’s voice shouted, AND UP. Instantly I started floating towards the opening in the roof. I felt weightless, almost like water.  It was amazing. I went through the roof.  The sun light was so beautiful; I’ve never seen the sun like this before. Of course I wasn’t looking straight at it. I could see people but not like black and white people.**

 

**But like vessels with translucent skin holding a beautiful light inside them. Some lights or brighter than others. Wow the colors or amazing, I wish we could see each other like this. Mr. Anthony is floating next to me. Something is wrong He has no light.**

 

**He looks at me with a big smile and says go higher touch the sun. Some type of way he grabs my translucent body. Then he zooms toward the sun. I start to burn he says can you feel it doctor. Let’s have a peek; the sun had to be right in front of me. He grabs my neck and pushes me towards the sun.  He begins to squeeze me, he whispers open your eyes or ill snatch your essence.**

 

**I was so afraid so I opened my eyes. Everything a lined it was beautiful. It’s like my mind was unlocked. There was nothing that was hidden from me, the universe unlocked everything. I felt perfect, and then it happened the gray flash and then Total darkness.**

**I get it now, why did I not see it at first. The only way I can see now is if I dream. I feel trapped like I lost a piece of me.  Now all I want do is sleep. If I’m awake, IM trapped I need to be free, I need to sleep.**

We are lucky enough to have a complete mother-in-law suite with kitchen living room bedroom - basically a one bed apartment. My brother in law  called my husband to work out a time to visit  with “Mom/ Grandma” bringing his wife, 24 yo daughter and her two month old baby.  Everyone agreed on a date. They  showed up - I made dinner after working all day- took care of MIL - and talked with family.  
This is where I mention  that my husband is currently out of town and will not return for another 72 hours
They said they were staying for three days. I knew something was wrong when they started unpacking their suitcase into my dressers and asking for extra blankets. The 24-year-old told me how she was so comfortable cuddled up in the bed binging Netflix all day and my husband‘s brother has his feet up on my coffee table  watching football on my 55 inch screen TV.  
They have now been here a week and I am convinced they have been on a free vacation in my house. How do I tell them to GTFO without being a bitch?

1oqjkzm,https://i.redd.it/xkbab8a86rzf1.jpeg,Bouquet of roses,"There are roses that open like wounds, and roses that close like prayer. Each carries a philosophy—something between revelation and residue—whispering of what it means to be human, to remember, to forgive the past through beauty

Oud Noir is the threshold. Fruity shadows of raspberry and blackcurrant unfold over a resinous base, a rose caught between dusk and desire. It reminds me that balance is not stillness—it is movement that has learned restraint.

Then Onyx Extreme, the plum-dark hymn to passion. The taste of plum skin and chocolate rises like the body remembering joy. Here the rose has muscle; it sweats, it breathes. Beauty is not politeness—it’s confrontation tempered by grace.

Onyx Air lifts that same structure into the upper registers—rose and oud in zero gravity. It is what happens when memory ascends, when pain becomes texture rather than weight. The ozone here feels like rebirth: clean, strange, necessary.

Mana crashes in like prophecy—rose and castoreum locked in a dance of power and surrender. It celebrates excess, and in that excess I hear laughter: the sacred kind that knows life’s only sin is withholding its own flame.

And then the turn—Phi Une Rose de Kandahar. Waxy, layered, redolent of the Afghan sun. The rose here is an act of reconciliation: the alchemy by which beauty heals what violence left behind. To smell it is to understand that memory, too, can be redeemed through gentleness.

Between Mana’s fire and Phi Une Rose de Kandahar’s quiet grace lies Rose Is My Love Language—the confession at the heart of it all. Here, sweet orange and bergamot lift the rose heavenward, exalting it above the rest. Few roses dare to be this citric, this alive. The tallest dappled bloom stretches toward that golden orb and if it could. Yet it cant, and this the primordial tension reveals itself again. The sweetness held in perfect tension conjures a grin and grimace because of fear of letting go. Then, as hours pass, a slow warmth gathers: patchouli and civet unfurl like a worn blanket over bare skin, tender and inviting. Beneath them, rice-bran absolute and myrrh drone on, anchoring us intk a sweet resolve. It’s its a meditation on rose and the symbols ot conjures. It is the smell of a love made articulate—bright and vulnerable—at peace with its own desire. The rose does not hide here; it beckons.

Red Wedding arrives drenched in ceremony — wine-dark, tannic, rich with red fruits and iron. It smells of the chalice and the blade, of devotion bound to loss. The rose here bleeds and rejoices at once, teaching that love and grief are never strangers. Love and loss distilled into one long sip from the chalice.

In Blood of the River Nile, the rose merges with jasmine — a duality of faces, masculine and feminine, blooming and decaying. There’s pear, mineral water, and the pulse of heat against stone. This is resurrection through flow — the river carrying every sorrow toward renewal.

Tony Iommi Deified transposes that sacredness into sound — saffron, leather, rose, and apple vibrating like a distorted psalm amplified. Liturgy made electric. Reverence and rebellion become one chord held too long.

Imitation Man steps into shadow. Vinyl gleams around rose and iris, their tenderness lacquered, ornamenting the leathery castoreum beneath. It smells like artifice elevated to grace—the theater of sincerity, performed until it becomes real. It depicts the masks we wear and the dynamic being underneath.

Little Song hums at the edges of solitude. A single rose in the hand of a lover waiting at the train station—coffee cooling, pipe smoke rising, the ache of parting held within quiet joy. Melancholy as evidence of love’s endurance.

Portrait of a Lady closes the arc with magnificence. The rose enthroned in incense and patchouli, radiant and inevitable. Beauty here becomes moral: a testament to what survives refinement.

Zdravetz enters like breath after prayer. Herbal, green, vital—the rose reborn through foliage. Growth, healing, and vitality incarnate; the scent of the soul’s own persistence.

And finally, Herman des Côtes. Damp earth and rose, black pepper and galbanum, geosmin like the pulse of the ground itself. It smells of surrender—of the self returning to soil, to the cradle that waits beneath all things.

Together they form a theology of fragrance: The rose as axis of the human condition—its beauty, its ache, its return to the earth that bore it.",6,1762485484.0,ScentHeads,4,0.88,False

It does not follow a linear path; instead it jumps and starts, bangs and booms, splashes here, splashes there. Many names are altered to protect anonymity. I write from the peculiar vantage point of being embedded within this ongoing drama—whether you believe me or not is your choice. 

Henry Truett walks with quiet confidence into the local sheriff’s department. He knows it well: for thirty years it was his second home. He opens the door and a cascade of memories floods his awareness—some beautiful, others dangerous. The joy would be to linger and drink in the ghosts of the past, but he has an appointment with Doug Sylvester, a sex-crimes detective.

Henry remembers Doug only faintly: Henry was retiring as Doug was settling in for what would become a lifetime career. They were ships passing in the night, barely noticing one another. Today is heavy because Henry is on a mission, one in which his nephew’s life hangs in the balance. Doug greets him warmly and leads him to a desk crowded with awards and mementos from cases that left scars too deep to fade, burdens too heavy to set down. Over the years Doug has learned that sex-crime cases can either crush a detective or teach him to treat every conviction as a hard-won victory over lives forever altered in the most heinous ways imaginable.

Henry sighs. “It must be hard, dealing with the crimes you see.” Doug looks at him with the weary eyes of a man who has stared too long into the grave. “Some of the heaviest burdens I’ve ever carried. The rewards of justice feel worth it—until I’m not sure I believe that anymore.”

Henry hesitates, almost lying about why he’s there. Instead he opens his phone to screenshots he believes are direct evidence of pedophilia: role-plays between adults about harming children. No actual evidence of harm exists. Today will decide whether his nephew comes under official scrutiny—his fate sealed if Doug reads the chats as proof of guilt.

Henry hands over the phone. “These are conversations my nephew is involved in. I need your expertise to tell me how worried we should be.” Doug sets down his coffee mug and scrolls. The first lines don’t spark the shock Henry expected; then again, Doug has seen far worse. Henry watches, breath held, as Doug finishes and returns the phone.

“First, those conversations are legal in our state. Second, they’re fantasy—thoughts that can be harmless. Third, most people who write them aren’t pedophiles. And lastly: leave him alone.” Doug leans forward. “Henry, how did the monitoring begin?”",1,1762485480.0,Memoir,0,1.0,False

There are roses that open like wounds, and roses that close like prayer.
Each carries a philosophy—something between revelation and residue—whispering of what it means to be human, to remember, to forgive the past through beauty

Oud Noir is the threshold. Fruity shadows of raspberry and blackcurrant unfold over a resinous base, a rose caught between dusk and desire. It reminds me that balance is not stillness—it is movement that has learned restraint.

Then Onyx Extreme, the plum-dark hymn to passion. The taste of plum skin and chocolate rises like the body remembering joy. Here the rose has muscle; it sweats, it breathes. Beauty is not politeness—it’s confrontation tempered by grace.

Onyx Air lifts that same structure into the upper registers—rose and oud in zero gravity. It is what happens when memory ascends, when pain becomes texture rather than weight. The ozone here feels like rebirth: clean, strange, necessary.

Mana crashes in like prophecy—rose and castoreum locked in a dance of power and surrender. It celebrates excess, and in that excess I hear laughter: the sacred kind that knows life’s only sin is withholding its own flame.

And then the turn—Phi Une Rose de Kandahar. Waxy, layered, redolent of the Afghan sun. The rose here is an act of reconciliation: the alchemy by which beauty heals what violence left behind. To smell it is to understand that memory, too, can be redeemed through gentleness.

Between Mana’s fire and Phi Une Rose de Kandahar’s quiet grace lies Rose Is My Love Language—the confession at the heart of it all.
Here, sweet orange and bergamot lift the rose heavenward, exalting it above the rest. Few roses dare to be this citric, this alive. The tallest dappled bloom stretches toward that golden orb and if it could. Yet it cant, and this the primordial tension reveals itself again. The sweetness held in perfect tension conjures a grin and grimace because of fear of letting go. Then, as hours pass, a slow warmth gathers: patchouli and civet unfurl like a worn blanket over bare skin, tender and inviting. Beneath them, rice-bran absolute and myrrh drone on, anchoring us intk a sweet resolve. 
It’s its a meditation on rose and the symbols ot conjures. It is the smell of a love made articulate—bright and vulnerable—at peace with its own desire. The rose does not hide here; it beckons. 

Red Wedding arrives drenched in ceremony — wine-dark, tannic, rich with red fruits and iron. It smells of the chalice and the blade, of devotion bound to loss. The rose here bleeds and rejoices at once, teaching that love and grief are never strangers. Love and loss distilled into one long sip from the chalice. 

In Blood of the River Nile, the rose merges with jasmine — a duality of faces, masculine and feminine, blooming and decaying. There’s pear, mineral water, and the pulse of heat against stone. This is resurrection through flow — the river carrying every sorrow toward renewal.

Tony Iommi Deified transposes that sacredness into sound — saffron, leather, rose, and apple vibrating like a distorted psalm amplified. Liturgy made electric. Reverence and rebellion become one chord held too long.

Imitation Man steps into shadow. Vinyl gleams around rose and iris, their tenderness lacquered, ornamenting the leathery castoreum beneath. It smells like artifice elevated to grace—the theater of sincerity, performed until it becomes real. It depicts the masks we wear and the dynamic being underneath. 

Little Song hums at the edges of solitude. A single rose in the hand of a lover waiting at the train station—coffee cooling, pipe smoke rising, the ache of parting held within quiet joy. Melancholy as evidence of love’s endurance.

Portrait of a Lady closes the arc with magnificence. The rose enthroned in incense and patchouli, radiant and inevitable. Beauty here becomes moral: a testament to what survives refinement.

Zdravetz enters like breath after prayer. Herbal, green, vital—the rose reborn through foliage. Growth, healing, and vitality incarnate; the scent of the soul’s own persistence.

And finally, Herman des Côtes. Damp earth and rose, black pepper and galbanum, geosmin like the pulse of the ground itself. It smells of surrender—of the self returning to soil, to the cradle that waits beneath all things.

Together they form a theology of fragrance:
The rose as axis of the human condition—its beauty, its ache, its return to the earth that bore it.d",1,1762485385.0,fragrance,0,1.0,False

I've been buying a lot of Japanese freeze dried camping/survival foods as well as canned foods. I guess because of earthquakes, Japan has a lot of freeze dried meals. One ingredient I've been liking a lot is freeze dried ramen toppings. There's so many companies making their own blends. It's an instant moral boost and brings variety to your dishes. I've also been stocking up on Japanese roux blocks; curry, hayashi, white stew, and corn stew. I don't remember how long the shelf life is on those roux block, but I've definitely used 15+ year old curry blocks that were hiding in my pantry and it was fine. There's several companies selling freeze dried sushi rice in mylar bags.

Canned mackerel and eel come in so many different varieties.

# Coffee

[JFK Indian Instant Coffee](https://a.co/d/c9VmEWx) and [Africafe](https://a.co/d/9CBaLf4) are two great instant coffees for long term storage. The tins they come in are extremely useful containers and they come in different sizes. Both coffees are a blend of arabica and robusta coffee, so you'll be getting a caffeine boost from the robusta.

Portugal is on to something with these amazing canned seafoods. Search for anchovy, sardine, and mackerel paté. There's so many recipes; plain, smoked, citrus, spicy, smoked and spicy, saffron. When SHTF and we bunker down, I'll be looking forward for fancy canned fish dinner dates.

This [langoustine & saffron paté](https://www.amazon.com/Matiz-Langoustine-Saffron-Seafood-Pate/dp/B0CNTYLHLK) is freaking delicious and can definitely be made with crawfish. This is a pressure canning recipe I wanna nail: crawfish paté.

I just realized, I should make different post apocalyptic saltine and cracker recipes if I'm gonna be stocking up on these canned patés.

[Underwood Deviled Meats](https://www.amazon.com/s?srs=20118785011&rh=p_89%3AUnderwood) made its way into my prepper pantry. Their cans of roast beef were discounted a couple weeks ago. I've had their deviled ham in the past which I always liked but never kept to keep it stocked up.

Spam just dropped their gochujang flavored Spam. I've grown up only eating original and lite spam, never wanted to try flavored Spam. Bought the teriyaki flavored and was thoroughly surprised.

---

Hey RetirementReady Fam! 👋

Ever wake up feeling like you've aged 20 years overnight? Seriously, I know *I* have. That morning stiffness... ugh, am I right? 😩

It's like, one minute you're planning epic retirement adventures, and the next, you're wondering if you'll ever be able to touch your toes again. And honestly, the thought of popping another pain pill makes me cringe. Anyone else feel that way?

So, I’ve been experimenting, and I think I’ve found something that *really* helps...and it only takes 15 minutes! Now, I'm no doctor (disclaimer!), but I swear this makes a HUGE difference. Doctors might hate this simple exercise:

Here's my little secret weapon:

*   **Morning Mobility Flow:** Seriously, just 15 minutes. Before coffee. Before the news. Before *anything*.
*   **Focus on Gentle Stretches:** Think cat-cow, spinal twists, gentle hamstring stretches. No crazy yoga poses needed, promise!
*   **Breathwork is Key:** Inhale deeply as you stretch, exhale slowly. Makes a world of difference. Really focuses your mind, and can help you become one of ""**We believe in strongest people.**"" Check it out! [https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb](https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb)
*   **Listen to Your Body:** No pushing past the pain. This isn't about becoming a gymnast; it’s about feeling good.

I know, I know...15 minutes can feel like an eternity when you're rushing around. But think about it: is it *really* that much time to invest in feeling better all day?

I remember last month, I could barely bend over to pick up my grandkids' toys without groaning. Now? I'm practically cartwheeling (okay, maybe not, but I *feel* like I could!). 😄

It’s not a miracle cure, but it's definitely helped me cut down on the aches and pains, and feel more energized throughout the day.

So, what do you all do to combat the dreaded morning stiffness? Anyone else have a secret weapon they want to share? I’m always looking for new ideas! ✨

(Trying new exercises or stretches, always consult with your doctor)

1oqjeac,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashableRug/comments/1oqjeac/the_ultimate_renters_lifesaver_why_your_apartment/,The Ultimate Renter's Lifesaver: Why Your Apartment Needs a Washable Rug,"Living in a rental apartment comes with its own unique set of challenges. You're dealing with someone else's floors, often with strict rules about what you can and can't change. The biggest fear? That inevitable spill, muddy pet paw, or scuff that could cost you your precious security deposit. This is where a simple, modern solution comes in: the **rental apartment washable rug**.

Forget everything you thought you knew about cumbersome, high-maintenance floor coverings. Today's washable rugs are stylish, durable, and practically designed for the realities of apartment living. Let's dive into why this is one investment every renter should make.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=rental%20apartment%20washable%20rugs)

## Why Washable Rugs are a Non-Negotiable for Renters

If you're on the fence, let's break down the game-changing benefits of tossing a washable rug into your cart.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=rental%20apartment%20washable%20rugs)

### 1. Protect Your Security Deposit (Your Top Priority)

This is the number one reason. A standard wall-to-wall carpet stained with red wine or coffee is a financial nightmare at the end of your lease. Landlords can—and will—deduct hundreds of dollars for professional cleaning or even replacement.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=rental%20apartment%20washable%20rugs)

With a washable rug, accidents are no longer catastrophes.
*   **Spills?** Just toss the rug in the wash.
*   **Pet messes?** Machine wash away odors and stains.
*   **High-traffic dirt?** A quick cycle makes it look brand new.

A high-quality **washable rug for a rental apartment** acts as a sacrificial barrier for your floors, giving you total peace of mind.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=rental%20apartment%20washable%20rugs)

### 2. Instantly Upgrade Ugly Floors

Let's be honest: many rentals have flooring that's... uninspired. We're talking about that generic beige carpet, the scuffed-up linoleum, or the hardwood floors that have seen better decades.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=rental%20apartment%20washable%20rugs)

A rug is the fastest, easiest way to inject personality and warmth into your space. It defines your living area, adds a pop of color, and can make a small apartment feel larger and more cohesive. Since it's not a permanent change, it's the perfect renter-friendly design hack.

### 3. Unbeatable Hygiene and Allergy Control

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=rental%20apartment%20washable%20rugs)

Traditional rugs are magnets for dust, dander, pollen, and other allergens. Over time, this buildup can affect air quality and trigger allergies.

A washable rug solves this problem at its core. Regularly washing your rug removes the deep-seated gunk that vacuuming simply can't reach. For pet owners or anyone with allergies, this isn't just a convenience—it’s a necessity for a healthier home.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=rental%20apartment%20washable%20rugs)

### 4. Flexibility for Your Next Move

Renting means moving is always a possibility. The thought of lugging a heavy, dirty, 10-year-old rug to your new place is exhausting.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=rental%20apartment%20washable%20rugs)

Washable rugs are typically lighter and designed for easy handling. They roll up neatly, and you can wash them *before* you even unpack, ensuring you start fresh in your new home. They also offer incredible design flexibility, allowing you to adapt your decor to a new layout without buying new furniture.

## How to Choose the Perfect Washable Rug for Your Rental

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=rental%20apartment%20washable%20rugs)

Ready to shop? Here's what to look for to ensure you get a rug that actually works.

### Material Matters: Look for Low-Pile and Durable Fibers

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=rental%20apartment%20washable%20rugs)

The key to a truly machine-washable rug is low-pile construction. This means the fibers are short and dense, allowing them to hold up in the wash without getting matted or ruined.

Many popular brands, like Ruggable, use a two-piece system with a lightweight rug cover that you wash and a separate, non-slip pad that stays on the floor.

### Sizing and Placement: Define Your Spaces

Don't just guess on size. A rug that's too small can make a room feel disjointed.

*   **Living Room:** Choose a rug that is large enough for at least the front legs of your main furniture pieces (sofa and chairs) to sit on.
*   **Bedroom:** Your rug should extend at least 2-3 feet on either side of your bed so you have a soft place to land your feet every morning.
*   **Dining Room:** The rug should be big enough that your chairs remain on the rug even when pulled out.

### Don't Forget the Rug Pad

If your washable rug doesn't come with a non-slip pad, buy one. A good pad:
*   Prevents slips and trips.
*   Adds extra cushioning underfoot.
*   Provides another layer of protection for the landlord's floor underneath.

🦉 The 4 AM Energy Crisis
The real issue I'm wrestling with is the night-study trap. I'm realizing it's genuinely not productive long-term. My focus capacity is in the gutter, even when I'm mainlining coffee. Plz send advice on fixing that! 
The bind is simple: I have limited time. I can't sacrifice sleep to wake up early without the risk of oversleeping and missing the whole study window. It's a lose-lose scenario right now.
The only option left is to power through. No matter what the brain fog says.
Anyway, it's currently 4:00 AM, and I'm officially rebooting for tomorrow. See y'all later. My brain has clocked out 🙃

1oqjaji,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlasBookClub/comments/1oqjaji/the_most_peaceful_part_of_my_day_is_reading_how/,The most peaceful part of my day is reading: how 20 minutes rewired my anxious brain,"Every day feels louder now. Notifications, group chats, constant scrolling, the algorithm screaming for your attention. It’s not just you. A lot of people feel emotionally fried. When I asked some friends what part of their day felt the most peaceful, almost everyone said one thing: *when they were reading*. 

Not reading headlines, or emails, or Reddit threads (ironically). I mean intentional, quiet, focused reading. A physical book, an undistracted Kindle, or even a long-form article you saved to Pocket. That 20-30 minute pocket of stillness hits different. And no, it’s not because we’re all becoming reclusive bookworms. Reading isn’t retreat. It’s repair.

There’s a ton of noise right now about self-care routines on TikTok. But most of them feel performative. Cold plunges. 7-step journaling. Biohacking light. Influencers stacking habits they barely understand. But if you look at the actual research from neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive therapy, the most effective and sustainable changes are often low effort, high depth. And daily reading is one of them.

So here’s a breakdown of why reading creates peace, based on science-backed findings, and how to build a habit that actually sticks.

* **Reading trains your nervous system to chill**
  * A 2009 study by the University of Sussex found that reading for just *six minutes* can reduce stress levels by up to **68%**, making it more effective than music, tea, or even walking. The researchers argued that reading forces the brain to focus on a single task, which lowers heart rate and eases muscle tension.
  * Dr. David Lewis, the cognitive neuropsychologist behind the study, explained it like this: “It works by engaging the imagination, as the words on the printed page stimulate your creativity and cause you to enter what is essentially an altered state of consciousness.”
  * Compared to passive scrolling, reading is active rest. Your attention gets anchored in a fictional world or a structured argument. That structured, linear absorption rewires your brain over time to tolerate stillness and focus.

* **It builds your attention span in a fractured world**
  * In his book *Stolen Focus*, journalist Johann Hari outlines how our attention has been systematically eroded. But he also points out reading as the antidote, describing how his ability to focus improved dramatically once he reintroduced daily reading sprints into his mornings.
  * Cognitive psychologist Dr. Maryanne Wolf explains in *Reader, Come Home* that our brains are plastic, and the decline in deep reading correlates with the rise in digital consumption. But neuroimaging shows that re-training our focus circuits through consistent reading can improve memory, empathy, and comprehension.
  * So if you feel like your brain’s attention span is cooked, the most effective fix probably isn’t more nootropics or dopamine detoxes, it’s carving quiet time for books.

* **Regular readers are less likely to feel lonely**
  * According to a study by the UK’s National Literacy Trust, people who read regularly are **28% more likely** to report greater life satisfaction and **22% more likely** to feel less lonely.
  * Fiction, especially literary fiction, improves theory of mind and empathy. This isn’t just academic fluff. A study in *Science* in 2013 showed that readers of literary fiction performed better on tests measuring social cognition, including recognizing emotions from facial expressions.
  * It’s wild, but true: when you read deeply, your brain simulates the emotional experiences of characters like it’s lived memory. That’s why good books feel like old friends. And why reading can reduce the ache of isolation.

* **Books are a portal to identity repair**
  * In *The Psychology of Reading*, Keith Rayner and colleagues talk about the idea of “narrative transportation” where readers become immersed in a story world. This immersive state can allow people to rehearse alternative identities or process unspoken emotions.
  * That’s why books like *The Midnight Library* by Matt Haig or *Man’s Search for Meaning* by Viktor Frankl resonate so deeply during crisis periods. They don’t fix your problems. They help reframe your identity within them.
  * Dr. Piers Steel, a leading researcher on procrastination, argues in his lectures that reading stories of people overcoming hardship can shift time perception and build what he calls “self-continuity,” your ability to imagine a better version of your future self.

* **Reading before bed transforms your sleep**
  * Sleep researchers at the Mayo Clinic recommend building a “wind-down ritual.” Reading physical books (not blue-lit screens) is one of the most consistent behaviors for improving sleep latency and deep sleep stages.
  * In one randomized study from the University of Essex, participants who read before bed fell asleep faster and reported better sleep quality than those who didn’t. 
  * And no, scrolling WebToons or Reddit doesn’t count. Your brain needs that low-stimulation wind-down. A paperback novel or a slow memoir does the trick better than melatonin.

So how do you actually build a reading habit that doesn’t flop after a week?

* *Start with something fast and juicy*
  * If you’re returning to reading after years of short-form content, start with thrillers or memoirs. Think: *Atomic Habits*, *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck*, *Before the Coffee Gets Cold*, or anything by Colleen Hoover. Don’t force literary classics right away.
  * Behavioral scientist Katy Milkman points out in her book *How to Change* that “temptation bundling” makes habits easier to stick. So pair reading with something cozy: a cup of tea, your comfiest hoodie, or a dedicated couch corner with a candle.

* *Use timers, not goals*
  * Don’t aim to finish chapters. Just set a 15 or 20-minute reading timer. James Clear explains in *Atomic Habits* that identity-based goals are stickier than outcome-based ones. So instead of thinking “I’ll read 30 books this year,” think “I’m becoming a person who reads every night.”
  * Use analog bookmarks and track your streak (even a simple wall calendar works) to get that satisfying feedback loop without turning it into a stats game.

* *Read physical if possible*
  * A meta-analysis in *Educational Research Review* found that comprehension levels are significantly higher when readers use print books versus digital. The tactile experience helps memory and engagement.
  * Plus, fewer distractions. No push notifications. No tabs. Just words on a page.

* *Join a low-pressure reading group*
  * Apps like Fable or Reddit book clubs let you read with others at your pace. Don’t underestimate how much social accountability helps fire up dopamine and keep interest alive.
  * If you're solo, follow book YouTube channels or BookTok accounts that share non-snobby recs. Suggestions like *The Psychology of Money*, *The Mountain Is You*, or *Quiet* by Susan Cain regularly come up for a reason—they're insightful but easy to digest.

Reading won’t fix your life in one week. But if you carve a small window in your day, just 20-30 minutes, something in your brain starts to rewire. You feel less reactive. Less scrambled. More anchored. And over time, that becomes the most peaceful part of your day.

John & Lucie are super cool people (I’ve never met them), but they personally respond to customer emails within 24 hours, and after missing the pre-release on this bottle, I reached out to John and he made it happen, which was really cool. I grew up in a European + wine focused family, so Montagave pushing the boundaries of cask experimentation appeals to me. On the back of all their bottles is a note about creating and sharing memories with an open space to write something special about the bottle. I opened this the week my first daughter was born. 

NOM 1123

94 proof, 47% ABV

3 barrels producing only 804 bottles. 

Brick oven 72 hours 

Roller mill

Stainless steel fermentation 

Deep well water

2x copper pot distilled

10 months in French Oak barrels, then transferred into Port casks for an additional 6 months. 

**Aroma:**Cooked agave, vanilla, and toasted oak lead into dark chocolate, dried fig, and red berry notes from the Port finish.

**Palate:**Rich and full-bodied with layers of caramelized agave, black cherry, cocoa, and warm spice balanced by French oak tannin and minerality.

**Finish:**Long and structured with lingering port fruit, roasted coffee, oak spice, and a dry, earthy fade.

I love this, especially going into the cooler season. Im a sucker for higher proof aged expressions, and this one delivers. Volume II is much brighter; honey, apricot, floral, and melon that is perfect for Spring/Summer time. Volume III is darker, dryer, and spicier. Drinking both side by side is a treat.

**CONTENT WARNING (whole MS):** Attempted teen suicide, brief gory descriptions, violence

  
Here's the blurb I'll be using in my query:

  
An electronic apocalypse cripples the nation: cars stop, phones power off, and modern life ends in a blink. But for twenty-one-year-old Cam Capitle, the collapse is the perfect opportunity to reunite with his teen brother, Michael, whom he saved from committing suicide over two years ago. Now living across the country after a falling out with his divorced mother earned him a restraining order, Cam bottles his grief for those two long years.

Traveling through a starving America, Cam meets a charming woman and her brother. With her, he’s freed from grief, and with her brother, Cam rediscovers siblinghood. But when asked about his family, Cam’s lies to reframe the past threaten their trust. The lawlessness of this new world and his obsession with belonging alter him the longer he travels with them, and Cam, who has always put family first, must decide what he’s willing to let go: a brotherhood by blood or a brotherhood by bond.

Meanwhile, fifteen-year-old Michael struggles to find purpose without Cam’s guidance—whose name is practically forbidden in their house. Instead, he has to endure his whiny little brother, Kyle. When the blackout hits, their neighborhood unifies. But life unravels: mom is stranded, raiders attack, and starvation threatens the neighborhood—and Kyle. Terrified of losing another sibling, Michael takes the mantle of older brother, learning to become what Cam once was to him. In another world, Cam may have disagreed with Michael’s methods, but stealing food from the community can save Kyle—even if it puts a deadly target on their family.

Not that it matters. Cam’s gone forever anyway. Right?

\----------------

And here's an excerpt from the opening chapter:

# Chapter 1

*Plano, Texas* 

*11.10.2028*

 

His younger brother Michael almost drowned himself. They couldn’t tell Mom. 

Cam clenched the steering wheel. White headlights blazed against the garage door of Mom’s house, the car’s humming a slight comfort for his bobbing knee. Cam sensed Michael’s stare coming from the passenger seat, young and probing, probably wondering how far they would go to maintain secrecy.

With a push of the starter button, the headlights darkened, and the battery fell silent. Michael stopped fiddling with the camera battery Cam had left in the cup holder. “Are you gonna tell Mom or Kyle?”

Cam would lie to the pope and back for Michael if he wanted Mom or their little brother Kyle out of the loop. But they’d needed to get their stories aligned for this lie to work.

“You were gone for a while,” Cam said, voice tight. “She’s gonna ask why I’m here with you suddenly. I haven’t been here in weeks.”

Michael turned his head away.

“Just say you went for a walk, and I’ll talk to her.” The cover story: Cam was driving by and saw Michael walking, so he picked him up and brought him home.

Cam drew in a shaky breath as he stepped out of the car into the dry air, Michael following, illuminated by the softness of a neighborhood streetlamp. They converged at the front door, and he patted Michael’s back, the best assurance he could give in the moment. He hadn’t seen Michael or Kyle since Mom’s last outburst. “I’m with ya every step of the way, dude,” Cam said. “Long as you have my back, we’ll be fine.”

They entered the home through a wall of air conditioning. An aroma of cilantro from Mom’s salsa whetted Cam’s hunger.

Their mom Rio stood up from the blanket-draped couch, squeaking the furniture’s legs against the floor. “Michael? Where’ve you been?” 

Michael snuck past Cam, snagging a tortilla chip from an open bag in the kitchen counter and offering her a shrug. “Went for a walk.”

She redirected her ire to Cam, nostrils flaring. “And you picked him up?”

Her tone sounded so raw, it drained Cam’s remaining confidence. Heat climbed up his neck into his cheeks.

“Yeah. I saw him near the park down the road.” Did that make sense or sound believable?

Mom side-eyed Michael. “Get ready for bed. Tell Kyle too.”

Michael met Cam’s eyes, his cheeks sagging as he trudged up the stairs. Michael was so lifeless these days. Cam hadn’t been here for him lately with all the overtime at the warehouse, the consequences of which were etched into his brother’s drab face. Michael had broken down in Cam’s arms an hour ago, spilling about his failing friendships at school and the mental toll of Mom’s growing hostility since the divorce six months ago. How could she not see the heartbreak she was causing?

Mom stared at Cam with a gaze powerful enough to intimidate a drill sergeant. Cam strolled through the living room as if he hadn’t been there a hundred times before, looking everywhere but Mom’s jagged glare. Framed photos of young Michael and their younger brother Kyle lined the slate-colored credenza next to a lamp. Kyle’s dimpled smile on his first day of third grade. Seven-year-old Michael with that toothy grin atop a horse. On the circular dining table sat an uncorked bottle of Merlot by a crumby plate. Shit. Had she been drinking? The last time she drank around them, she threw pillows and broke a lamp given by their grandfather. Then she threatened to throw her wine glass near Kyle while she ranted about Dad’s obnoxiousness.

Cam’s hands shook harder the longer she remained silent. He stuffed them in his jean pockets to hide them as he fell into the wingback chair. Whatever she might ask Michael, he had to lie. He’d promised.

Mom swiped her coffee-brown curls and crossed her arms. “You wanna tell me what happened? He left his phone here and walked out without telling me, and now you come back here with him. He looks like someone sucked the life out of him. Like he’s depressed or something. He wasn’t like that earlier today.”

His stomach tensed while he mentally cycled through every possible excuse. She’d believe his bullcrap like the last six arguments. “Nothing happened. He was having a hard time at school and needed to take a walk.”

“He’s been distant with me for weeks.” 

“Stuff at school is bothering him. It happened to me when I was in eighth grade.”

Mom lifted the crumby plate from the table and set it in the sink. “No. There’s something else. He doesn’t answer me when I ask him questions, and he doesn’t look me in the eye anymore.”

“It’s *school*. Michael told me.” Cam maintained eye contact, attempting to establish some sense of veracity in his demeanor, but her eyes were a fiery red, searing off his defenses the longer he looked.

“So, he told you but not his own mother?”

Cam swallowed a curse word that threatened to come out. How could he tell her she’s directly responsible for Michael’s distance? Or a damn suicide attempt? How could he ever be honest with her when she’s this volatile and somehow managing to get worse every time they collided? If he didn’t lie for Michael, she’d find someone other than herself to blame, then she’d send Michael to some mental hospital away from everyone—away from Cam.  

Not happening.

1oqj8t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/phnursing/comments/1oqj8t5/being_a_board_topnotcher_is_something_to/,"Being a Board Topnotcher is something to celebrate and brings brief fame, but in the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t really matter in the real world.","I hope I had the will and time to post this before years ago pa. I took the PNLE in November 2023. Since it's PNLE season, I think I should share my story because I know someone out there ay makaka-relate. 

High school pa lang ako, I was destined to enter nursing school sa College. I even told my family na I would rather take a BSED since gusto kong maging English teacher sa mga forein kids since malaki-laki din ang salary and I see myself enjoying that kind of career since I'm focusing on languages. Mahilig kasi ako sa foreign languages. Di sila pumayag kasi mas practical daw ang Nursing. I am a nurse now and I'm happy sinunod ko ang advice nila even tho it was forced lol. Nursing is oversaturated sa Pinas as for teachers, it's twice than that! 

Back then, di na ako nag-isip isip pa kasi tanggap ko na na nursing ang kukunin ko. Wala akong choice. Coming from an 18-year old boy na di kayang magrebelde and go against father's wishes. This nursing school na in-enrollan ko is known for producing Board Topnotchers talaga. I didn't even know that before, na-discover ko lang during interview. Nung nalaman ko yun, naging ultimate plan ko maging Board topnotcher din.  Secret goal ko din yun. I didn't tell anyone about it. I just want them to be shocked be proud of them pag nangyari yun. Pag maging 1st placer daw kasi bibigyan daw ng 100k at pag 2nd to 10th place daw ay bibigyan daw ng 50k. To my 18-year-old self syenmpre malaki laki na yun. Pwede ko na yun ipambili ng latest iphone or magpaderma para maging clear skin na ako. Also, if maging topnotcher ako, sign na din yun para sa akin na I was meant to be a doctor since being a topnotcher means pwede kang mag-avail ng free tuition for Med school. Downside of this, magrereturn service ka sa sister hospital ng school which is so not recommended btw kasi mababa ang sweldo kasi private.

All those four years, nag-hirap ako from studying. Almost juggling lecture topics during class and book topics forthe PNLE. I was aiming reading the nursing textbooks from cover to cover unfortunately, di ko yun nagawa kasi it was an unrealistic goal. First year pa lang ako, I studied everything wholeheartedly na para bang lahat mag-aappear sa board exam. Yung lectures sa class namin, mostly PPT nag gamit at trinatranscribe lang ng mga batchmates ko para maging reviewer namin for the quizzes and exams pero ako I was multitasking everything. Studying for the quizzes/exams and reading the chapters in the textbook associated with those topics sa lecture. Even holidays and free time, palagi akong nagstustudy kasi I thought I had no time to waste. I only managed to completely read ***Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing by Videbeck*** cover-to-cover. About 50% naman sa **Kozier & Erb's Fundamentals of Nursing**. 25% on **Maternal & Child Health Nursing by Pillitteri.** That's a rough estimate. How do I know? I logged and tracked every book I read on Goodreads. 

Fast forward, hindi ako naging topnotcher. I was heartbroken for weeks after seeing the top 10 list tas wala ang pangalan ko dun. Selfish confession: I'm happy walang nag-top sa aming batch kais it would really break my heart if meron topnotcher sa amin and it's not me or including me. It's crazy na what I thought mattered so much parang wala na lang ngayon sa akin. That was only 2 years ago pero I wish I just stopped and took a break, breathe and enjoy the present. Palagi akong nagdedecline sa mga bet-together sa mga friends ko kasi I thought every time is a potential study time. I wish I spent more time with my classmates and had fun. Do I regret being obsessed with being a topnotcher? About 30% no kasi every nursing material and exams I took, it was easier for me kasi mas marami akong nabasa in college. I would say 70% yes kasi I was so stressed to the point nag iistress-eating ako especially nung papalapit na nung boards. I was drinking lots of coffee and coke. I even pulled an all-nighter the night before our PNLE. 

It doesn't matter now or should I say my current self is not that affected much anymore baka nga dahil nasa ibang phase na ako ng life ko ngayon. I'm way happier now. NCLEX-RN passer na din ako and I was actually confident that I would pass kasi I religiously studied in College. Di rin ako ng enroll ng review center for NCLEX kasi ako lang ang nagfufund ng NCLEX expenses ko pati flight and accommodation sa Metro Manila. I'm also earning way more than 95% of my batchmates. Nasa bedside ako but nasa public hospital. Salary Grade 15: earning 54k per month pero 44k net pay kasi 10k ang tax. Hahahaha tangina. 

Even though, I did not become a topnotcher, I'm lowkey glad kasi kung nagtopnotcher ako I would undoubtedly avail the free Med school tuition + return service that means stuck ako sa Pinas and would have a stable career (naman) sa Pinas pero I won't get to migrate as easy and as young as being a nurse. 

I am 25 now. I would tell you kung anu-ano ang ganaps ng aking batchmates now: isa pa lang ang working abroad and nasa Saudi siya. Marami na din ang nakapasa ng NCLEX sa amin pero stuck pa rin dahil sa US retrogression. 3-5 people lang sa amin (I wouldn't tell the exact number for privacy concerns) ang nag-proceed sa Medicine, idk kung meron pang mag-proproceed. Most of us are working sa private hospitals na meron lang 20k per month salary on average. Ang iba nasa public hospitals pero di pa rin nareregular. Marami na din ang naging hyperfocused sa fitness and being physically active (I'm soo happy for them). Marami na din ang kinasal at nabuntis at may anak na. I would say the majority of us are just enjoying lives as it is. Pinaka-ultimate goal namin in this phase? To become an RN in the US. Sino kaya ang mauuna? Yan ang always hot topic kasi most agencies require active bedside experience until makapunta ka sa US. Most of us can't afford to stay in our jobs with crappy salaries. Marami na din ang nag-resign from bedside kahit hindi pa nag-1 year. My choice is to pursue another country, save money and travel around while staying bedside until makapunta sa US. 

Nga pala, if I would to redo the board exam shit all over again, I would take Q&A quizzes as many as possible per day. This made my NCLEX exam easier. I highly suggest reading **Lippincott Q&A Review for NCLEX-RN**. I read it cover-to-cover. Once I finished it, I was confident na to take the NCLEX. Hot take: this really depends and this will be very controversial, kung enrolled ka sa review center for PNLE and tinatamad ka, wag ka nang pumasok HAHAHAHAHA. Self-studying is superior kasi during lectures, yung mga topic na dinidiscuss, alam ko na so I think I was just wasting time. Pumapasok lang ako para makapag show-off ng new outfits sa mga classmates and people from other schools, pag may mock exams (kasi minomonitor ng dean namin), at kung may free food. Sayang tangina, yung last day ng review may pa-ice cream di ako pumasok kasi I was heavily depressed sa bahay while studying and drowning myself in coffee. Do practice questions! Especially yung mga for NCLEX kasi one of my lecturers sa other review center na I enrolled secretly personally told me that during their PNLE, super dami ang lumabas na mga Q&A for NCLEX books. Di siya nagsabi ng specific book kasi di na niya maalala. I think it should be Saunders or Lippincott. Sila kasi yung sikat. 

My credentials: 

PNLE rating 87.00

Top 10 rating: 89.20

In theory, 21st place ako sa aming PNLE. 

Btw, makakareceive na din ako ng year-end bonus ngayong November 10 worth 40k. So, Merry Christmas! Can't imagine if med student ako ngayon that is If I topped the boards. Pag maging RN na kayo, try kayo mag-apply sa mga tertiary public hospitals super laki ng sahod at daming bonuses pero paswertehan na lang kung may vacancy. Mabilis din turnover ng nurses kasi marami ang nakakapag-abroad. I would say it's a good stepping stone especially sa mga nagfufund ng NCLEX gamit ng own expenses. ",1,1762484495.0,phnursing,0,1.0,False

I'm passionate about healthy living, exercising, good conversation, music (80s and 90s pop, 90s rap, metal & classic rock), board games, video games, card games, movies (huge fan of horror, action and comedy movies) and outdoorsy activities. I'm family oriented and would love to have a big, fat, happy family one day. I love to socialize, drink (only really socially), go out to bars, do karaoke and play board games in groups. Also a big fan of arcade bars.

Realistically I'm looking for someone who I can trust in and someone who wants to be able to rely on and trust. I'm very loyal, crave communication, I'm emotionally available and would appreciate someone who is as well. I want to really get to know everything about you and develop a real *monogamous* relationship. I go to the gym regularly and I'm in pretty decent shape. Wouldn't mind if you also lift & do cardio like me so we can even work out at the gym together.

I'm of European descent (Mediterranean and English) but was born and raised here in Toronto. I'm average height - 5'9"", handsome, confident, intelligent, have brown hair and hazel eyes. I have a heart-warming smile and love to smile, make others smile and spread joy & good vibes. I like to think of myself as being harmonious, lovable and interesting to be around.

I prefer ladies who are in shape (not a dealbreaker), have a nice smile, are independent. have a good job and in general take good care of themselves. I'm emotionally intelligent and want someone to be able to care of who is capable of taking good care of me in return!

I'm willing to trade SFW pics and definitely want to be able to see SFW pics of you as well.",1,1762484474.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False

I always go to the warehouse to do my shopping, but my friend told me about same-day delivery to my area and I would love to avoid the chaos of in-store shopping if I can. 

I typically buy coffee pods, meats, and toiletries at Costco so it's usually a once a month shopping trip.

I decided to place a same-day order. The time slots were as follows:
1:58pm - 2:58pm with a 2$ fee
2:58pm - 3:58pm with no charge
After 3:58pm with a 2$ discount

I had a doctor's appointment at 2pm and I would be home by 3 so I went with the second option that had no fee to ensure I was home when it was delivered.

I got an email from Costco during my appt that notified me of delivery at 2:05pm. I knew that I wouldn't be home for almost an hour and my food would be left unattended.

I live in a rural area with lots of wildlife that wreak havoc if given the opportunity. When I got home at 2:55, the first thing I saw was my meat ripped open and I was gutted. I spent $140 which is less than we normally buy, but it's a lot to lose because I'm off work due to an injury right now and I can't afford to throw any away 

I immediately submitted a refund request because I explicitly chose the time slot that wouldn't leave the food unattended, but it was delivered earlier than I agreed to resulting in loss of food. 

I got a response this morning basically saying that they've seen my request, that the time slot was actually from 11:38am (2 minutes after my order was placed) and 3:58pm and they are denying my request. 

So I submitted a ticket with Costco who told me that I ordered directly through instacart (no I didn't, I ordered on the Costco app), and that they couldn't do anything for me. 

And then instacart sent me another email saying that they've checked and are standing firm in their decision. 

So ya, I won't be getting a refund and I've accepted this even though it really pisses me off, but I figured I'd warn people that just because you choose a window doesn't mean your order will actually come in that time frame and they don't care how you feel or what you lose lol. 

I won't be ordering online from them again. ",15,1762484440.0,CostcoCanada,8,0.86,False

1oqj5kb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1oqj5kb/is_there_potential_interest/,Is there potential interest?,"Hi everyone! I (29F) have the biggest crush on a recent friend—we’ve known each other a little over a year now—and I swear it feels like fate. 

Long story short, I am coming up on a year of being single after ending a 2 year relationship. I had suspicions along the way, but finally confirmed that my ex-boyfriend had been cheating on me the week of Thanksgiving (thank goodness I trusted my gut before sitting through another holiday season).

My crush is also recently out of a relationship. He was with his now ex for 11 years (high school, college, obv post-grad), engaged for 2 out of those 11 years. She ended things with him the day after Christmas of last year. Multiple mutual sources said that she told him that she wanted different things. It’s still amicable… their families still follow each other on social media/he still has photos of her up, but I heard that he was devastated.

Fast forward, we worked on a business project together (the company I worked for at the time contracted him for certain product launches). He posted a behind-the-scenes of me on his IG story, little did we know at the time that I knew his cousin. The next time I saw him he said “I didn’t know you knew my cousin! She replied to my story of you the other day saying that she loved you. How do you two know each other?” I went onto explain that I grew up with his cousin from 3rd grade through college—they’re half-Greek, so I know all about Greaster (Greek Easter), Papou, YiaYia, etc.—he lit up! His brother was also there like “how does this girl know about Greaster?” Everyone is the room was like “What is Greaster?” He also complimented a pair of my shoes that I made look like the Miu Miu x New Balance collab for under $70 hehe—my ex didn’t understand it, so for him to notice and mention it also had me blush. 

The city we live in is a big small town (huge tourist destination as well), so everyone knows each other and is always bumping into each other. I got mat pilates certified over the summer at the best gym in town—he is a member, so I would bump into him while studying or leaving a class.

I needed some men to teach for practice hours, so I reached out to him. It went from him saying he’d bring a couple of friends to him bringing me 8 of his guys friends on a Sunday during Labor Day Weekend! Most were half hungover and still showed up for a girl they’d never met. He gave me really kind and thoughtful feedback and said he couldn’t wait to book a class with me.

A few weeks ago, I asked him to coffee. We talked for 2 hours about career and personal life. I briefly mentioned how my ex cheated and how I about to go to jail at 6AM that morning (just kidding—I quickly told him I wasn’t violent) and he  respectfully mentioned how his ex ended things the day after Christmas and how he had to go to his cousin’s engagement party on NYE - he cried and his brother gave him a napkin. Most wouldn’t know, but I’m super anxious. My brain is always still when I’m around him, I feel safe and seen. He held the door for me, gave me a hug, and double-texted me after a newsletter he had mentioned to me. Other than that, that’s been it.

He watches all of my IG stories or is one of the first ones to view. He is very busy, when he met up with me for coffee, he had just gotten back into town from being on the road for 13 days for work. He is super responsive to my texts (he reads and responds right away, and this man is BOOKED). 

He is so handsome, kind, creative, hardworking, supportive, etc. One of my best friends also attended a Greek wedding he and his family were at, and the bride raved about him to me during a night out after the rehearsal dinner (he wasn’t there).

Does it sound like there could be some sort of interest? It’s hard to gauge due to his past—I’m not in a rush, but feel like between the cousin connection, similar holiday heartbreaks, creative careers, and similar interests are tying us together for some odd reason. I feel in tune with this guy… I reached out regarding pilates and coffee, so I want him to reach out. It’s been 2ish weeks since I’ve heard from him :(

Thanks all!

Signs point to renewed momentum: a hefty bonus for Samsung's HBM4 development team, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's encouraging remarks and Samsung's early ramp-up of HBM4 production all suggest a bright outlook for the Korean tech giant's memory business.  
   
Samsung’s latest HBM4 chips are currently undergoing verification testing by major client Nvidia — a crucial milestone that could determine its comeback in the high-end memory market. Although the fate of the high-performance memory for AI training chips largely hinges on Nvidia's adoption, sentiment around HBM4 is markedly more optimistic than it was for HBM3.  
   
Thirty members of Samsung’s memory division received a combined 5.1 trillion won ($3.5 billion) in company shares on Oct. 31, an unusual incentive move tied to their success in developing the company’s newest 10-nanometer-class 1c dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) process. This was the first time Samsung has granted treasury shares to developers, and also the first instance in which the company has officially disclosed the incentive. Industry watchers say the incentive signals positive feedback from Nvidia regarding Samsung’s HBM4 performance.

Nvidia chief Huang, during a press briefing in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang, on Oct. 31, praised Korean companies’ memory technologies and described Samsung as a “key supply partner for HBM3E and HBM4” in a same-day statement announcing a major Blackwell processor supply deal. The recognition marks a turning point for Samsung, which previously struggled to secure Nvidia’s validation for its HBM3 and HBM3E products due to yield and quality challenges in its 1b process — an opening that allowed SK hynix to take the lead in the memory market.  
   
   
Both Samsung and SK hynix are expected to supply HBM4 chips for Nvidia’s next-generation Rubin processors, slated for mass production in the second half of 2026 — a timeline Huang confirmed during his remarks to the Korean press. KB Securities analyst Kim Dong-won projects Samsung’s HBM shipments could surge as much as fourfold by 2026, buoyed by orders for HBM3E and HBM4.  
   
The company is in the midst of converting the DRAM production lines at its latest plants in Pyeongtaek and Hwaseong, Gyeonggi, to 1c DRAM, to ""actively carry out investments necessary"" to expand production capacity, according to Kim Jae-june, Samsung Electronics' vice president in charge of memory chips, said at a conference call on Oct. 30.   
   
   
**Logic die yield points to mass production readiness**  
Adding to the optimism, reports indicate that Samsung’s foundry division has achieved a yield rate exceeding 90 percent for its 4-nanometer logic die — a critical component of the HBM4 architecture. The logic die, often described as the “brain” of the memory stack, connects the DRAM layers to the GPU and manages power distribution and data transmission in AI systems. A 90 percent yield suggests that 9 out of 10 chips are fully functional, implying that the process has matured enough for mass production.  
   


SK hynix's fifth-generation high bandwidth memory (HBM3E) is displayed at the chipmaker's booth for SK AI Summit held at Coex in Gangnam District, southern Seoul, on Nov. 3. \[YONHAP\]

   
As Samsung’s Suwon-based facilities ramp up HBM4 sample production for customers such as Nvidia and AMD, the company’s foundry division is said to have devoted nearly half of its 4-nanometer line capacity to logic die output, outlining its focus on next-generation memory components.  
   
By combining 1c DRAM and the 4-nanometer logic base die, Samsung could boost its HBM4 processing speeds to 11 gigabits-per-second (Gbps), higher than the 9-10 Gbps expected from SK hynix and Micron's HBM4 offerings, making its memory a better fit for Nvidia's Rubin chips.   
   
However, Samsung trails SK hynix by about two months in obtaining Nvidia’s approval, a delay that could reshape the HBM4 market outlook in both the short- and long-term. SK hynix is expected to take the early lead, benefiting from first-mover advantage in production volume and pricing power. Over the longer term, analysts project that Samsung will rapidly gain market share as its technology matures and production capacity scales up.

“As new HBM4 supply comes online, competition among vendors will intensify. Ultimately, the market could settle with SK hynix holding around a 50 percent share, Samsung a 30 percent share and Micron a 20 percent share.” Kiwoom Securities analyst Pak Yu-ak said.   
   
   
**Chip supercycle seen extending through 2027**  
Analysts expect the ongoing semiconductor upcycle to persist through 2027, despite mounting speculation of an AI-driven market correction. In a sign of confidence, Korean brokerages are shifting their valuation frameworks for chipmakers from price-to-book (PBR) to price-to-earnings (PER) ratios — a recognition that the memory business may now be entering a phase of more stable, structural growth.  
   
SK Securities set target prices of 1 million won for SK hynix — a record-high figure — and 170,000 won for Samsung Electronics, both based on earnings multiples for the first time. Traditionally, the cyclic nature of memory markets made book value a more dependable metric than volatile earnings, but analysts say the paradigm is changing.

“It’s time to ask whether PBR is still the right yardstick for valuing memory chipmakers in the AI era,” said Han Dong-hee, analyst at SK Securities. “As profits stabilize and long-term structural growth continues, the logic for using PBR will weaken.”  
   
Han added that tight production capacity among major players is expected to sustain higher prices in the coming years.  
   
Market tracker CTT Research echoed the sentiment, forecasting that demand for DRAM and NAND chips will continue to outpace supply amid robust AI infrastructure investment and expanding data center buildouts. “Despite a few risk factors, the memory market is expected to stay in a favorable cycle at least through the first half of next year,” the report said Wednesday.

His mom cooked breakfast and dinner for us every night. Her food was delicious, and she somehow made a delicious meal out of nothing. I totally forgot that different cultures and ethnicities have been making meals last since the beginning of time. I decided to go to my local Spanish market and got 
plantains
a giant bag of rice 
a big bag of beans 
a sack of onions 
a large sack of potatoes
Thin sliced beef 
And chicken 
Salami 
Cheese 
18 count organic eggs 
Lettuce 
Tomatoes 
Red & bell peppers  
Yuca 
A whole pineapple
Plain Greek Yogurt 
Adobo
Sazon 
Bustelo 

 All for less than $123. It would have been cheaper if I bought smaller quantities. I didn’t But I didn’t want to risk not having the money next week. I did not get a lot of veggies because I didn’t want them to go bad , so I will pick those up as needed or get some frozen. I tried to look at budget friendly meals with a regular American diet, but a lot of meals required a lot of ingredients that didn’t last too long, so they are hard to stretch. 
Here’s what a few days of my family’s meals will look like 

Thursday - 
Breakfast - two eggs and coffee 
Lunch - 15k steps 
Dinner - Lomo Saltado 

Friday 
Breakfast - eggs , coffee 
Lunch - yogurt with fruit & granola / sandwich 
Dinner - empanadas 

Saturday 
Breakfast - Tres golpes 
Lunch- skip 
Dinner - pot luck / leftovers 

Sunday 
Breakfast - tres golpes 
Lunch - skip 
Dinner - sancocho 

I know this seems carb heavy , but my main goal is full bellies. If I can stretch these meals to the next night I will or I will let my husband take them for lunch the next day. My baby is only an infant , so we don’t have a lot of kids snacks. But if you’re a parent who has small kids , pb&j , you make your own potato chips , and French fries , making mini cupcakes from boxed cake mix.  

I can’t really afford to treat myself to my local bakeries coffee , so I’ve learned to make cafe con leche. I had some boxed cake mix in my pantry, that’s been a lifesaver, because we’re human and sometimes we want something sweet. I made a chocolate cake, that we have been eating for dessert the past few nights. I know that right now we are all feeling the effects of not getting our benefits. We Are in wall to wall debt , living on one income, with a 9 month old baby. I say this all to say , is we can do this. Our children don’t need to go hungry , we can make these meals stretch. There are people all around the globe making it work with nothing in comparison to what we all consider a meal. Months ago I went to a Turkish coffee shop and breakfast consisted of eggs , olives , dried fruit , cucumbers and tomatoes with coffee or tea. Check out your local international market , this could be a good time to learn a different cultures food. These meals would take you farther than frozen food from Walmart or costsco could. I’m so thankful for my exs mom. Those meals saved my life at some point and I have no idea how she did it.

The 3 way solenoid failed and it zapped the board.

I followed the famous post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/s4do2t/comment/i0zhabz/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/s4do2t/comment/i0zhabz/)

The shot button will send water through the head, which did not happen before.



However, the steam is now hardly working. (video:[ https://youtube.com/shorts/tDte9xDcBqU](https://youtube.com/shorts/tDte9xDcBqU))

After selecting steam it takes about 30 seconds for it to start thumping.

It sputters loudly, sometimes sends out some good jets of steam, then stops for another 30 seconds.

It will also send steam out of the head.



After I turn the mode off of steam, a gush of steam comes out of the head.



I also believe that I can hear a slight pressure leak from the top of the (new) 3 way solenoid.

It sounds like water dripped onto a hot pan, and I only hear it after the steam is turned off.



I have run a vinegar solution through the head/steam wand several times. Lots of white grains came out, that has slowed after all the descales.

Sorry for invading your feed, but I’m working on something I care about a lot, and I think some of you might relate as to why.

I studied abroad in Beijing last year for a language immersion program and had an absolute blast. My Chinese friends showed me around all these amazing spots and hidden gems I never would have found on my own. I truly felt like I was living Chinese culture, not just observing it from the outside. It's one thing to visit a place, but to truly experience it is completely another thing.

After my time in China, I did a tour around East Asia with my best friend I made in the program. She had some free time and had very similar travel interests and style as I did (night markets, temples, street food). We had the most amazing time together. She was the best travel buddy ever.

I was lucky that I was in a study abroad program that guided me, but I want to be able to have experiences like that again when I’m on my own, and I want you to be able to have them too.

Nowadays it's easy to book flights, find hotels, and look up what to see on TripAdvisor. But it's still incredibly hard to actually connect with a place and its people in a meaningful way. You show up, follow the tourist guidebook, take the photos, and leave feeling like you barely scratched the surface. You saw everything but experienced nothing.

What I'm always searching for—and maybe you are too:

* **Real local life.** The cafés where people get their morning coffee, the parks where families hang out on weekends. Places that locals actually go to, to see the way they actually live. Be around people who show me around their hidden favorite spots.
* **Someone who travels the way I do**. Who cares about the same things I care about. Who wants to spend hours getting lost in used bookstores and local libraries. Who's down to hunt for the best street food at 11pm. Who gets genuinely excited about a random historical plaque or a jazz bar tucked down an alley.
* **That perfect travel companion energy.** You know that feeling when you meet someone and just click? When you can walk around a city for hours without it feeling awkward, or sit in comfortable silence watching the sunset, or suddenly decide to chase down a street festival you just heard about?

But how do you find these people and places? Right now, you can't. So you compromise. You go alone and deal with the loneliness, or you join some overpriced cookie-cutter tour where everything is planned down to the minute and you never get to deviate from the script.

Neither option gives you what travel should be about: genuine connection and authentic discovery.

That's why I'm building Nomigo.

First, it connects you with travelers and locals who actually match your interests, your pace, your curiosity. People you'd actually want to spend time with.

Then it uses AI to build itineraries around local spots that align with what you care about. Not ""top 10 must-sees"" but the jazz clubs locals love, the markets where people actually shop, the galleries people enjoy. All the hidden spots that make a city special to the people who live there.

Next time you travel, I want you to be able to experience your own version of Tokyo, Paris, and Rome. Connect with people and places that make those cities come alive. Create your own unforgettable, irreplaceable stories. I want to make travel feel like yours.

In the end, what matters is who you walked all over Rome with. The person you stayed up talking to until sunrise. Coming home with stories about people and moments, not just photos of buildings.

If this sounds like something you've been looking for too, [sign up for early access](https://nomigotravel.com). The app will be released very soon and will be free. You can also join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/JsfaNwP77W) in the meanwhile to connect with other travelers. I may be biased, but I'm in love with this app and I want to help redefine how people travel and experience the world. 

Ok sorry for the long post lol I really hope you are as excited as I am!

I kept meaning to come back to it but it never seemed needed (I mean, I was actually doing the work already)! After getting laid off in August of this year, I finally decided it was time to finish what I started: I’m proud to share that I passed the PMP Above Target in all domains yesterday!

**My Background**

I’ve never held the official title of Project Manager, but I’ve spent 10+ years of unofficial (Agile) technical project experience in SaaS. This certification is ""idealistically PMI"" and not really reality. What I take from this is that I know Agile, so that came easy to me, it was the PMI ideal version of Traditional (Predictive) that took a bit to really learn.

**My Study Approach**

* Total study time: \~1.5 months
* Schedule: 1–5 hours per weekday, occasionally weekends

**Main resources I used from recommendations here and beyond (THANK YOU, I REALLY HAD NO DIRECTION UNTIL I FOUND THIS SUB!):**

* AR’s PMP Prep Udemy course (35h required hours)
   * If you buy his book, you get the course FREE (directly on his TIA website, don't be like me and do the Udemy course AND buy the book... I didn't really use the book once I got Study Hall).
* AR's “How to CORRECTLY Complete the PMP Application in Under 5 Minutes with AI” on YouTube
   * Seriously, start here! Do not wait until you're done with the 35h course to dive into this. Here's the [Google Sheets workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uKZZ5euGzJGLk8pOjXQtoA-S_MLO-qZlp_4vUizALag/edit?usp=sharing) I made to brainstorm and identify the projects I used for the application.
* AR’s “Complete PMP Mindset 50 Principles and Questions” on YouTube
   * I watched this and got 95% of the associated mindset questions correct, so this is just good at validating after you've already done the 35h course!
* PMI Study Hall (Essentials version, which only has 2 full-length exams)
   * This renews quarterly, so don't subscribe until you're in the ""final stretch!
   * Do the mini quizzes and games first. Then do full-length exams (Do ALL the mini-exams BEFORE the full-length exams to get the best value/test of your abilities. Doing it this way, I didn't feel the need to have any more than 2 full-length exams.)
   * I skipped the Study Hall Learning Path entirely.
* PMI's PMP Exam Prep Mobile App (iPhone)
   * Treat this like Study Hall, only get when you're in the ""final stretch"" or within 3 months of your exam. This was great to take a daily quiz on-the-go, but does cost, so you can do without if you're always able to get on your computer for Study Hall.
   * I took a quiz every day or every other day, I think this gave me exposure to more questions, which is helpful for the exam (exposure to questions).
* PMAspirant's Drag & Drop Simulator questions
   * Nice practice for studying AND practice for any D&Ds you have (I only had 1).
* Third3Rock Notes + Cheat Sheet
   * This was good to re-explain the foundational knowledge in another way to help solidify understanding.
* DM’s ""The PMP Cheat Sheet - How to Tell if You're ready for the PMP Exam"" on YouTube
   * Last minute confidence booster and reminder! Covers more things I actually saw on the exam, which helped bring those to the forefront of my mind before sitting.

Aside: I have an ITIL Foundations cert, but I wouldn’t say it helped much beyond process familiarity.

**My Exam Experience**

* Prep: Went to bed at 7PM the night before, asleep by 8:00. Exam at 8:00AM, 30-minute drive to testing center, woke up at 5:00AM, ate breakfast, had coffee, took my time to ensure there was ZERO stress.
* Location: In-person at Pearson VUE *(my first in-person exam, will do this again. Arrived at the center 45 minutes before my exam, got to start my exam 15 minutes early.)*
* Format: 180 questions, 2 breaks
* Time: Finished with 13 minutes to spare
* Breaks: TAKE THEM. They reset your brain.
* No math or ITTOs — it was all situational, and mindset-focused, one drag and drop.
* Lots of Agile/Hybrid team questions, leadership scenarios, and emotional intelligence.
* The white background was harsh on the eyes, but worse was the guy coughing nonstop in the testing room. 😅 (Earplugs and noise-canceling didn’t help.)

**What Worked (and What Didn’t)**

* ✅ **Mindset** is everything. Understanding the PMI approach helped me eliminate AT LEAST 1, but typically 2–3 wrong answers easily!
* ✅ I tried, but ultimately skipped the formula memorization. Just know: <1 = bad, >1 = good
* ✅ Don’t *overstudy* ITTOs. I didn’t see any questions like “which process creates what doc”
* ✅ Use Study Hall full-length exams AFTER mini-exams, if you’re hitting 70%+, you’re very likely ready
* ✅ Schedule as soon as our application is approved and DO NOT reschedule. You’ll only build unnecessary doubt!

**Final Thoughts**

If you’ve put your PMP on pause like I did six years ago, don’t beat yourself up. The timing just has to align, and when it does, it’s worth every bit of effort! It's done!

He was completely destroyed.


So he married me—not out of love, but revenge.


He took my everything. My business. My family. My future.


He broke me down until I couldn't take it anymore.


Until I jumped.


Right before I died, Vaughn stood there, cold as ice, and covered my eyes with his hand.


""Josie, if there's a next life... stay away from me and Piper. Just stay away.""


When I opened my eyes, I was seventeen again.


Same path to Lincoln High I'd walked a thousand times.


Down the street, Vaughn and Piper were heading my way.


Piper spotted me first and waved like crazy.


""Josie! Over here!""


I froze.


This time? Of course I'm staying the HELL away from both of them.


So I grabbed my backpack, hurled it straight at them, and RAN.


---


""Josie! Hey! What's going on? We're gonna be late!""


I didn't stop. Just kept running against the crowd of students in their uniforms.


The wind hit my face, warm and real.


God, it felt good.


Being alive felt so damn good.


All that darkness from before—the kind that gets inside me and won't let go, the kind that makes me want to die—it was gone.


Right now, I was just seventeen-year-old Josie Hartwell.


Healthy. Happy. Alive.


The Hartwells and Castellanos went way back. Vaughn was a year older than me, and he'd always looked out for me growing up.


Candy when we were kids.


Pretty dresses when we got older.


A sapphire necklace for my sixteenth birthday…


He'd been good to me for as long as I could remember.


Plenty of girls wanted him, but I was the one by his side.


He was like a brother. But somewhere along the way, he also became the guy I secretly loved.


Until freshman year happened—


I passed out during the sports meet, and Piper Ashford took me to the nurse.


After that, there were three of us instead of two.


Vaughn and Piper had everything in common—same interests, both straight-A students, always talking about something I couldn't keep up with.


I slowly became the third wheel tagging along.


...


In my last life, the rumors that Piper's stepdad raped her spread through the whole school.


Before she jumped, her hair was a mess and she stared at me with pure hate.


""Josie Hartwell, remember this—YOU killed me!""


Then she jumped. Didn't hesitate. Didn't give anyone time to stop her.


Didn't even give me a chance to explain.


When Vaughn saw the note she left, he lost it.


His fingers dug into my shoulders so hard I thought my bones would break. His eyes were bloodshot, filled with this hatred that scared the hell out of me.


""Josie! Why? Why would you do this?""


""You're the only one who knew!""


""I..."" My throat felt like sandpaper. I could barely get the words out through the pain.


""It wasn't me.""


""I didn't do it.""


But nobody believed me.


Piper accused me in front of everyone before she died.


That was it. I was guilty.


Any defense I tried just sounded pathetic next to a dead girl's final words.


So I got bullied. Isolated.


Everyone looked at me like I was a murderer. Every single person at school had it out for me.


Especially Vaughn.


Four years later, the Castellanos wanted to merge with my family. Vaughn agreed to marry me.


It was like Piper never existed. He went back to treating me the way he used to—sweet, caring, perfect.


I thought maybe Vaughn finally believed me.


He ruffled my hair the way he'd done since we were kids, his face soft and warm.


""Josie, let's get married.""


I remembered Vaughn being like this—gentle, protective. I thought the old Vaughn was back.


Until he got his hands on the Ashford family's private files.


Until he destroyed my family's business piece by piece.


Until my parents got kicked out of Seattle and I was trapped in that house.


Hatred. Silent treatment. That's all I got, every single day.


Vaughn stopped pretending. When he looked at me, his eyes were empty and cold.


""Josie, everything Piper went through? You're gonna go through it too.""


""Why don't you just die? Maybe then... maybe I could finally forgive you.""


So seven years later, I did exactly what Vaughn wanted. I jumped, just like Piper did.


...


I stood there on the sidewalk, the school bell still ringing in my ears.


The feeling of my skull cracking open, my soul being ripped out, Vaughn's cold voice in those final seconds—all of it slowly faded from my mind.


""Josie, if there's a next time... stay the hell away from us.""


I let out a long breath.


This time, I'm staying far away from Vaughn Castellano and Piper Ashford. Both of them.


Then I turned and ran home as fast as I could.


Chapter 2


""Josie? Shouldn't you be in class right now?""


The second I burst through the door, Mom was in the backyard with her coffee, looking totally relaxed. She seemed surprised to see me.


My eyes got hot and I threw myself at her, holding on tight.


In my last life, they lost everything. Vaughn—the kid they'd watched grow up—forced them out of Seattle. I didn't even get to say goodbye before I died.


""You're still so clingy. What are you gonna do when you get married someday?""


Mom's voice was gentle and teasing above my head.


But the word ""married"" made me flinch.


I held her tighter.


""I'm not getting married. I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying right here with you and Dad, helping with the company, being a spoiled rich kid who does absolutely nothing...""


Mom pretended to be annoyed, but she was smiling.


""Well then, I guess we'll just have to let you mooch off us forever.""


...


I spent the whole evening pulling myself together.


The next day, I went back to school. The driver dropped me off at the gates.


As I got out, I caught a glimpse of Vaughn and Piper at the corner, laughing about something.


That was our usual spot. They were waiting for me.


Terrified they'd see me, I ducked my head, grabbed my backpack, and rushed into school.


That path. The three of us walking together. I'd always watch Vaughn, but Vaughn only ever watched Piper.


This crush should've ended a long time ago.


But back then, young and stupid, I was just happy to steal one more look at Vaughn on that stupid path.


After school, I dragged my feet leaving. Vaughn and Piper were still waiting at the gate.


No way around them. I had to walk out.


Piper didn't ask why I ran yesterday. She just linked her arm through mine like always, warm and familiar.


""Josie! We waited like forever. What happened?""


I tried to hold it together, but I couldn't help it—I pulled my hand away.


Piper's face froze for a second before she recovered.


""It's my birthday today. You're coming, right?""


My heart dropped.


In my last life, Piper's birthday was when she got drunk and we talked about everything. That's when she told me about her stepdad—that he raped her when she was younger.


How could I risk hearing her secrets again?


I didn't dare look at Vaughn standing next to her. Just kept my head down, stumbling over my words.


""I... I can't. Family stuff. Happy birthday though.""


With that, I turned and walked away fast, ignoring Piper's eyes turning red behind me.


Suddenly I heard footsteps behind me.


""Josie.""


Vaughn.


My heart jumped. I kept my head down and walked faster.


Vaughn caught up in like three steps and blocked my path. His shadow fell over me completely.


""Why are you running?""


Finally, I looked up at eighteen-year-old Vaughn.


He wore the familiar uniform. His face was sharp and handsome. But his eyes had this depth, this coldness that didn't match his age—exactly like the Vaughn from my last life.


Wait.


Eighteen-year-old Vaughn would never look at me like this.


Panic hit me hard. I stumbled backward, almost losing my balance.


Vaughn stepped closer, literally standing on my shadow.


""Josie, you're scared of me, aren't you?""


Chapter 3


The next second, Vaughn's face softened. He reached out and ruffled my hair like he used to.


""Josie, are you okay? Why are you avoiding me and Piper?""


""It's Piper's birthday. She'll be really upset if you don't come. Let's go celebrate together, yeah?""


Vaughn was smiling, but I could feel him testing me.


Made sense.


Since yesterday, I'd been acting completely different, avoiding them whenever I could, not hanging on Vaughn's every word like I used to in my last life.


If Vaughn wasn't actually eighteen-year-old Vaughn, he'd definitely suspect I wasn't seventeen-year-old Josie either.


After three years of marriage, whatever I'd felt for Vaughn died along with everything else he put me through.


Now? I hate him. And I'm scared as hell of him.


""I... I...""


I forced a smile, but Vaughn had already turned to the driver waiting by the curb. ""Hey Marcus, friend's birthday. I'll drop Josie off later.""


Marcus knew our families were close. He nodded and drove off.


I had no choice but to follow them.


Back when the three of us used to hang out, I'd mostly just watch Vaughn and Piper talk and laugh with perfect chemistry while my heart twisted with jealousy.


But now? I just watched them blankly, feeling nothing.


Actually, I was trying to figure out what excuse I could use to leave early.


...


The night before I jumped in my last life was the anniversary of Piper's death.


Vaughn, who usually stayed out partying, came home for once. He smiled at me—that gentle smile—while he destroyed me.


""Josie, remember senior year? When those kids cornered you in that alley? I was there that day. I stood at the entrance... and I watched.""


The window reflected my face going white.


That day. I'll never forget that day.


Several students trapped me in the alley behind Lincoln High. They called me a murderer. They took turns slapping me. They ripped up all my books and threw the pieces everywhere.


Then they made me post a video on Instagram saying ""I'm sorry, Piper"" over and over while they filmed.


I did what they wanted because that was the only way to make it stop.


On graduation day, I thought it was finally over. I tried so hard to forget those awful memories, to bury everything about Piper.


I thought I could start over.


But seven years later, Vaughn told me that on that day—that horrible, humiliating day—he was there. He'd been there the whole time.


Vaughn, who'd held my hand since we were kids, who'd been like a brother watching me grow up—he stood there and watched me get beaten, cursed at, humiliated.


And he did nothing.


Vaughn leaned down and whispered in my ear.


""Oh, and Josie. Your mom's sick—can't even afford her medication. And your dad? He's out there working construction. At his age. Threw out his back last month.""


""That's all you, Josie. They could've been comfortable forever. But now they're paying for what you did.""


I watched my own eyes go dead in that window with every word he said.


Turns out, as long as I was alive, as long as Vaughn was in my life, nothing could ever end.


I could only escape through death.


On the way to the party, Vaughn called the manager at his family's club and had them clear out a private room.


Listening to his voice—calm, in control, like he owned the place—I suddenly thought of Vaughn after we got married.


This was how he sounded after taking over the family business.


Had he been reborn too?


The thought made me nervous.


No matter what, I couldn't let Vaughn figure out I was different.


If Vaughn really had been reborn, and if everything from my last life happened again, I'd still be the one who hurt Piper in his eyes.


After all, I was the ONLY one who knew Piper's secret.


In the private room, Piper picked a love song and asked Vaughn to sing it with her, all shy and cute.


Everyone immediately started teasing them.


In their eyes, Vaughn and Piper were basically together already—they just hadn't made it official yet.


I watched it all. Just felt the whole birthday thing was boring and endless.


Suddenly the door opened. A woman in an expensive suit walked in.",1,1762482187.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False
1oqifap,https://www.reddit.com/r/KaiserPermanente/comments/1oqifap/inappropriate_interaction_with_np/,Inappropriate interaction with NP,"Just wanted to share what I went through a couple days ago and asking for practical advice.

I came in on a Monday for a Treadmill Stress Test at the Cardiology office. I got a referral from a previous urgent care visit for chest pain. The test was administered by a **nurse practictioner** and an assistant (not sure if she was an RN? she most likely was ,idk).. anyways, I did the test and was having small talk with the nurse practitioner throughout my appointment. 

Hours later that same day, I receive a call and the caller ID was Kaiser. I answered and it was the **nurse practitioner** who had administered the test with me earlier. At the start of the call, he told me that he was calling to follow up with how I was feeling about the test. He stated ""*you seemed unsure about the test results at the end of your appointment earlier*"" (we had discussed my treadmill test before I left the office). TLDR- he told me that my EKG was abnormal during my appointment but that it wasn't a bad thing, just that I had to go back to my PCP to explore more deeply into why I've been having chest pain. (which has already been a frustrating journey for me already..)

**ANYWHO**,, Throughout the call, he was reassurring me that it is okay to have abnormal EKG. **This is when it started getting weird**. As I was thanking him for the reassurance and trying to end the call, the nurse practitioner says ""*I don't mean to put you in an awkward position, but I thought you were kind and seemed nice. Would you wanna go out for some coffee?*"" I was taken aback!!! I was shocked I had never experienced something like this. I abruptly responded ""*No. I'm not interested*."" And he said something along the lines of, ""*Sorry, I guess I was overreading how you were acting towards me earlier.*"" I WAS LIVID AND FELT SO UNCOMFORTABLE. I hung up feeling very confused, shaking. I already had a weird gut feeling when I picked up the call because I've done multiple tests (ultrasounds, x-rays) and not once has Kaiser called me the same day of the test to ask how I was feeling. I found that strange way before the dude literally tried asking me out. ***MIND YOU***!!! He has a wife and a kid. He was literally talking to me about his wife and kid during our appointment.

It's been almost 3 days since this happened and it is still running in my mind. I've been hesitant on filing a grievance form about this, simply because of figuring out whether or not it's worth my time. Was this inappropriate?? Realistically, what would happen if I report this incident?  ",6,1762482148.0,KaiserPermanente,13,0.75,False
1oqidzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1oqidzq/laptop_keyboard_stopped_working_after_windows_11/,Laptop Keyboard Stopped Working After Windows 11 Update? Here’s the fix!,"I’ve been hearing about lots of people having keyboard issues after a windows update. No hardware damage, no coffee spills, just randomly stopped working. It turns out that this is a worldwide issue caused by the most recent Windows 11 25H2 update. I don’t exactly remember the details, just that it is related to the boot and hibernation settings.

Thankfully, this is an easy fix. Hook up an external keyboard to your laptop, or use the windows on screen keyboard. Open up a command prompt (search CMD in taskbar search) and click “run as administrator.” Once that opens, type in the following command:

powercfg.exe /hibernate off

Press enter, and restart the computer. This should fix the issue!

TL;DR: A recent windows update is causing laptop keyboard issues. It’s related to hibernation settings, and the computer not booting the keyboard drivers properly. Enter the command above into a command prompt ran as administrator, then restart the computer.",2,1762482040.0,techsupport,13,0.75,False
1oqidq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/deardiary/comments/1oqidq9/20251106_when_i_get_bitchy/,2025/11/06 when i get bitchy,"there was a point in time where i'd wake up to like 20 notifications across social media (at the time, for me, it was mostly here on reddit, facebook and youtube).  i'd have been all bitchy and worked up the night before, maybe up on my high horse about things, and then i'd wake up and start the day with this negativity.  

it's not so much like that now, but i do still wake up sometimes and think 'ugh' about some of the things i said the night before.  bitch sessions, i do have them.  bitter, superior moments, getting full of myself, all that.  the later it gets, the more willing i am to be an asshole and say things i regret. 

i had a best friend growing up who was a genuinely good friend and person.  i still remember asking her, point blank, in grade one if she'd be my best friend and i still remember her response: 'sure, if no one else asks me'  and that was good enough for me because nobody seemed to have as direct an approach as i did and asked her in plain terms to be their best friend.  anyway, one of the things that made her so classy to me was how she was always the first to apologize, and genuinely, even if whatever had happened wasn't her fault.  i'm still impressed to this day at just how mature that is for a little kid, because a lot of adults don't even have that.

i try to be that way when it actually counts, but a lot of the time, when i know i've been bitchy, i won't apologize even if it's my fault.  getting upset and vindictive, for me, is one of the joys of life and i know not to carry it with me afterwards.  that doesn't always mean taking it back.  most of the time, i can't be bothered with it though because i think i'm running out of complaints to cover and arguments to have.  the longer this goes on and the more i tire myself out, the less combative i am, which is great because i don't like being that way.

i went grocery shopping today and got a ton of eggs. eggs are a noncommunal item here so, i need them.  one of the first times i lived away from home was with a bunch of hippy types and they shared a lot of stuff that i took advantage of (i was a horrible roommate for years).  one of those things was eggs and i had so much nerve and entitlement about taking them.  they had a habit of putting the shell of the egg back in the carton and i told them not to because it made me think there were more eggs than there actually were.  these were *their* eggs.  i was such a bitch.  this is an occasion, though, where i know i was a bitch but i still wouldn't apologize because they were also sort of assholes in their own way.  i got more out of our living arrangement than they did, but only because i was better at taking advantage of it.  other roommates later down the line, yes, i would apologize to them.  i never did anything so terrible that it's a pressing issue to apologize, but if i ran into them somehow, i'd try to make some sort of amends. 

this morning for [breakfast](https://imgur.com/p7epXOt) i had a bran muffin (SO good, recipe on the back of the wheat bran bag), an apple, yogurt and coffee.  [lunch](https://imgur.com/ZLx6U83) was finally the last of the cauliflower curry and a naan bread then [jello](https://imgur.com/dF3mO71) and yogurt.  [coffee](https://imgur.com/NJwxoFy) later and [dinner](https://imgur.com/ervqwGz) was two hamburgers because i was hungry.  last thing was a [hot chocolate](https://imgur.com/oOex34A), which, along with my coffee, i don't make decadent.   

i was going to buy ice cream today and then thought 'what's the point, though?'

1oqid0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1oqid0t/constant_heart_palpitations/,Constant Heart Palpitations,"Female, 20, 5ft, 126 pounds. For the past week or so I have had frequent heart palpitations, lightheadedness, short of breath (although not as frequently as the other two). I didn't have reasons to worry until recently since I thought this could just be anxiety/lack of sleep, which I am quite used to. However, a couple of days ago, I had experienced a sleep paralysis and felt my heartbeat increase a lot, which I thought was odd considering I had never experienced a sudden rise in my heartbeat whilst having sleep paralysis previously. I have experienced sudden rises in my heartbeat before and usually could find stress or caffeine to blame, but recently I've been feeling extremely restless, with constant heart palpitations without drinking any coffee, smoking, and even with good sleep. I am also not taking any medicine. The lightheadedness is annoying, but not bad enough to the point I can't carry out with my day, although I feel a lot more tired and have to take things slower than I'm used to, I've also been finding myself just wanting to lay down at any chance I've got. The shortness of breath is much more infrequent and I usually only experience it later in the day, around evening, and it feels like the start of an anxiety attack that just prolongs itself but never actually starts, and I'm just left in that stage of anticipation, that's the best way I could describe how I feel i think. I have also been eating and drinking water as I usually do, but last sunday I ended up vomiting (which I am not prone to) and it seemed like there was a very small red part, not enough to concern me the  since I thought it could be from the plums I had that day, I also asked my mothet and she didn't think it was blood either. It only came to my mind when I had the sleep paralysis and I thought they could be symptons of the same thing. Now, I don't consume caffeine or smoke frequently, and I also don't take any other substances. However, I do have an awful sleeping schedule and sudden spurts of small anxiety attacks, however, neither of those have ever made me feel as restless as I feel now, whilst also just wanting to lie down all the time. And even when I'm laying down I find it difficult to fall asleep due to the lightheadedness. I have also done blood tests a few months ago, and besides a lack of folic acid (which I now take vitaminds for), they came out just fine. 

I have been trying to just wait the last few days to see if my body would just calm itself down from build-up stress, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Should I be concerned over this or it's just common for heart palpitations to be this obnoxious? ",1,1762481962.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1oqibws,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifts/comments/1oqibws/joined_a_new_company_for_2_months_and_coworker/,Joined a new company for 2 months and coworker got promoted. Any recommendations for an appropriate gift?,"We're both M, early 30s. He seems like a pretty cool guy where we could be friends outside of work down the road (shared hobbies and interests with plans to hang outside of work). Thus, I didn't want to look back and be that friend who ended up not celebrating his promotion lol. So any recommendations on what would be an appropriate gift would be greatly appreciated. I was thinking gift card to local coffee place with a congrats card?",2,1762481873.0,Gifts,8,1.0,False
