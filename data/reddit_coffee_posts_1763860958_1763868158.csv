by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Fulham vs. Sunderland: A Tale of Toenail-Clipping Tactics and a Goal That Broke the Internet**

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for the most *edge-of-your-seat* thriller of the season: Fulham vs. Sunderland, a match so dramatic, it makes a soap opera look like a nap. The final score? Fulham 1, Sunderland 0. But how did we get here? Let’s dissect this like a particularly motivated PE teacher dissecting a chicken (with questionable coordination).

**1. Parse the Odds: Because Math Never Lies (Unless It’s Sunderland’s Budget)**  
Let’s assume Fulham entered this match as -200 favorites, implying a 66.67% chance to win. Sunderland, meanwhile, lurked at +300, suggesting bookmakers gave them a 25% shot—roughly the same odds as a koala napping through a bushfire. Why the gulf? Fulham’s defense has leaked just 15 goals this season (a leak, sure, but not a flood), while Sunderland’s attack has mustered all the creativity of a toddler in a crayon factory—colorful, chaotic, and unlikely to score.

Historically, Fulham has won 5 of the last 8 meetings, a trend that Sunderland fans probably explain by claiming the opposition “cheated with better socks.” But stats don’t lie! Or do they? Ask the guy who “accidentally” added an extra zero to his team’s win total in 2018.

**2. Digest the News: Injuries, Drama, and One Player Who Still Wears Shin Guards as Socks**  
Fulham’s star striker, *let’s call him “The Human Highlight Reel”* (real name: Marcus?), returned from a hamstring injury sustained while tripping over his own shoelaces during a grocery run. Meanwhile, Sunderland’s defense is a rotating door of injuries: their captain, *let’s dub him “Captain Clumsy”* (real name: Kevin?), is out with a “knee complaint” likely caused by attempting to do a cartwheel during warmups.

Sunderland’s manager, *let’s go with “Tactician Ted”* (real name: someone with a mustache), admitted post-match that his team’s strategy was “to play it cool… but we brought a kettle to the pitch.” Translation: their “game plan” involved more hoping than plotting.

**3. Humorous Spin: Football So Boring, Even the Grass Napped**  
Sunderland’s offense was so anemic, it makes a vampire blush. Their best chance? A shot that hit the post… which was *also* their goalkeeper’s elbow. A true Hail Mary, if Mary had a concussion and a grudge.

Fulham’s defense? A fortress guarded by a man who once stopped a penalty by *accidentally* sneezing on the shooter. Goalkeeper *“Big Bertha”* (real name: someone with a better sense of humor) was so untested, he spent 80 minutes texting his barista about coffee preferences.

The lone goal? A 30-yard screamer from The Human Highlight Reel, who later tweeted, “This goal was so easy, my grandma could’ve scored… and she’s in a wheelchair.”

**4. Prediction: The Verdict That Surprised No One**  
Fulham’s victory was as inevitable as taxes in April. With Sunderland’s defense resembling a sieve at a metalworks convention and Fulham’s attack finally clicking (thanks to Marcus’s return), the result was a masterclass in “meh, but better.”

**Final Whistle:** Fulham wins 1-0, because Sunderland’s best play was a forward who tried to score by *throwing* the ball at the net. Spoiler: it didn’t work.

Next time, Sunderland, maybe try not to field a team that looks like they’re playing football in a dream. Or, you know, *practice*.

1p4c1nm,https://www.reddit.com/r/expo/comments/1p4c1nm/i_just_launched_my_first_mobile_app_spensio/,"I just launched my first mobile app, Spensio!","Hey everyone!

I’m super excited to share my first ever mobile app, Spensio. Built with React Native + Expo!  
After months of hard work, countless redesigns, and trying to perfect every detail, it’s finally available on the App Store! *(Play Store version coming soon.)*

# Why I built it

Where I live, many teens and young adults work in cafés, restaurants, bars, and similar jobs. Unlike full-time roles with fixed salaries, these jobs usually pay based on hours or days worked, with no contract or insurance, so income changes constantly.

I used to track my shifts in the Notes app — basically a messy spreadsheet. It was inefficient and easy to mess up, like forgetting a day or logging future shifts that got cancelled.

Spensio handles all of this automatically. It calculates totals, tracks worked days, free days, weekends, and more.

But that’s not all. You can log inflows and outflows using pre-made categories or create custom labels for anything you want. From your daily coffee or matcha habit, to side hustle earnings, small business revenue, or supply costs. Over time, you’ll see clear trends, track your biggest income sources and expenses, and understand your spending and earning habits in a visual, organized way.

I know this app isn’t for everyone, but I hope it reaches the people who will find it useful — helping them see where their money goes, cut unnecessary costs, save a little, or simply keep track of their shifts.

There are three subscription tiers, all offering the same features. Users simply choose how much they want to support the app. I kept prices affordable and avoided locking essential features behind paywalls… but as devs, we know costs add up.

Within the first hour of launching, I got my first subscription. It was a friend showing support, and yes, Apple took 30%, but it still felt amazing. That little support made all the hard work feel worth it. 🧸

I’d really appreciate it if you want to check it out and share your honest thoughts.

1p4c1mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1p4c1mr/7_month_old_dog_thinks_its_always_playtime_and/,7 month old dog thinks it’s always playtime and it’s stressful for me,"Sorry for the long read in advance. As the caption says, my dog thinks all day every day is for play. She is a 7 month old blind STUBBORN husky x. Simple quick things are way more complicated than it should be.

I sit on the couch and she will jump up next to me and bite me, jump over me, and bark at me. I have give her a bone or toy that she can play with, ignore her and get up if needed. I know some people have mixed thoughts on getting up as it could be showing her that she “won” and some say it’s showing her I don’t care for the behaviour. I have also been told to put her on the floor with her bone/toy every time she jumps up but she will just drop it and come right back up ready to go more and more. She doesn’t just nip, she does nip but she also full mouth around my arms biting. 

She asks to go outside but doesn’t go out to pee, when she was younger she was good at it but now that she’s older she doesn’t ever go out to do anything. I will open the door, she goes out but as soon as I have the door shut again she’s barking non stop at it and when I open it she’s immediately play bowing and pouncing around for me to chase her. When I step out with her she bites my arms, legs, pulls my clothes. I will turn back on to her and not acknowledge her or I will sit on the railing and ignore her in hopes she will just go do her business. That only works 1/5 times. Most times she will just try to jump up to me or will sit and bark until I go back inside. She also refuses to come back inside and I need to bribe her in with treats. I can’t pick her up since she’s heavy and when I approach she thinks it’s to play.

I took her to 8 week long puppy class starting when she was 4 months old and I hate to say she was the work behaved the entire time and didn’t quite seem to pick up on anything we were taught. It’s been very difficult trying to teach her anything. Now I hate to make it seem like I am blaming someone or pointing fingers, but my boyfriend (who wanted the dog) works rotational work, 2 weeks away and 2 home, definitely throws off any consistency I try to have for the dog. I wake up every morning with the dog at 7am and give her breakfast in a slow feeder dish, frozen, kong filled, balled up towels, etc. which takes her 20-30 mins to eat then I get ready for work and she follows me around then when I’m about to leave she’s just about ready for a quick nap. Then in the evening I try to bring her for a 40-60 minute walk with some off leash time for a little extra run. That used to really do the job to tire her out in the evening for an hour or 2 then when she woke up we would go outside for a bit and have supper in the same form as breakfast. She’d usually be fully passed out for the night by 9:30pm and sleep until 7am. I also change up my nightly mental enrichment with different games and attempts at training and different locations for her walks. My boyfriend sleeps till 11am, gets up goes for a coffee, does his own thing, fora couple hours and maybe will take her for a walk so I don’t have to after work. A lot of the commands I’ve seen to have taught her with certain words don’t work anymore as my boyfriend started calling them different things. Paw(me) = hand paw(him), touch = hand touch, sit = sit down, down = lie down. 

She isn’t crated whatsoever, I wanted to but since my boyfriend is home all day during his time off he didn’t feel like it was necessary. Thankfully she isn’t destructive to items or furniture. I call myself the gentle parent in the sense I try to do positive reinforcement with the dog, but my boyfriend is very old fashioned, I guess that’s the best way I can put it, and believes in a firm tap on the nose, deep loud yell, stomping or smacking a table top to make a loud startling nose and put the dog outside “in a timeout”. My boyfriend definitely has taught her some of these undesirable habits in my opinion He will rough house with her on the couch, goes outside every time with her and chases her around the yard and playing roughly for 10-15 mins every time with or without her doing a pee/poo. Then once she’s inside and not worked up she usually pees on the floor.

I was a regular dog foster (mostly puppies under 6 months) before her and never had these issues (I was also single for 80% of my fosters so it was solely me training with one plan). I know she is a husky which is a stubborn breed but I feel like I’ve made more progress by now previously with similar breeds.

1p4byjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1p4byjv/my_m27_gf_f24_wont_sign_a_prenup_and_i_cant_talk/,My (M27) GF (F24) won’t sign a prenup and I can’t talk to her about it,"Let me preface by saying I have zero intention of getting married, or even engaged during my 20s. But I find myself in a difficult and weird spot. I’ve been with my current gf for about half a year now, and things are great for the most part. We know virtually everything about each other, and generally have pretty easy open and honest communication. However, I do keep one secret from her, and that is that I’m a millionaire. Nothing crazy, just became a trust fund baby when my folks died. I try to keep this part of my life secret from as many people as I can since I learned the hard way about how wealth can cost relationships and friendships. Also important to note, I do not have full access to this money until I turn 35. Until that point I’m drip fed a small amount each month to help cover general expenses and live a modest but financially comfortable life, it’s not like I can just go drop a million on black on an odd Tuesday night. 

However, this girl isn’t stupid. I don’t appear to make a lot of money, yet I own a 4 bedroom house and 2 vehicles and don’t financially struggle. My answer for how I afford my life whenever someone asks is always just “work and savings and some stocks and the money from selling my folk’s place”, but I got laid off in the summer and haven’t been able to find something worthwhile yet and I’m sure she’s a bit sus of how I’m still financially fine months later and even talking about all the furniture I’m excited to buy on Black Friday. 

Now, I have no issue with keeping my wealth a secret; some might say it’s wrong to keep any secret from a partner, especially something big like this but I simply don’t feel we’ve known each other long enough for me to trust that the added knowledge of my wealth won’t change the relationship dynamic. My plan has always be to reveal my wealth after engagement before we sign prenups. This is where my issue comes into play. 

My gf has said or done a few things as of late that have caused me some worry, namely 3 things.

1. For the past 3ish months, she’s made joking comments every now and then about me secretly being rich. “I really want to quit my job, so if you’re secretly a millionaire now would be a great time to tell me,” “I hope you’re secretly rich so I can just be a SAHM.” This is just a couple direct quotes, she’s said some variation of this me being a secret millionaire joke and wanting me to support her between 15-25 times now. Typically at least once or twice a week.

2. At the beginning of October she came over in the morning for a surprise coffee. I was budgeting my expenses and balancing my checkbook (checkbook has very big numbers in it) at the time and she saw my work and commented on how much writing was in my checkbook. Idk if she discerned any numbers or anything but still makes me feel uneasy she knows I have a checkbook at all and purposefully pointed out how “full” mine is.

3. This is the biggie that led me to make this post. A week ago we were at a get together with friends and we were playing jackbox. One of my prompts for a game was to list 3 questions you should know about a woman before marriage, and one of mine was “will she sign a prenup?” My gf was reading my response over my shoulder as I typed it and flashed me a cute smile while simply saying “No🙂.” I didn’t show it at the time and I haven’t mentioned it to her yet, but this threw me off as a prenup is very much a dealbreaker for me. I also find it a bit weird that she said no to a prenup, as by all accounts, what she’s told me of her family’s wealth vastly surpasses what I’ve told her about mine.

My issue is I don’t know if she knows about my wealth or not, and if she does know if it’s just icing on top of the love cake or if she’s just holding out hope for a bag or something; AND I can’t even just ask her about it to clarify since if I ask her if she’s knows and she doesn’t I end up telling on myself. Honestly just not really sure what to do here, the only thing I can think of right now is talk to her about the prenup and try to somehow explain without also explaining why not signing a prenup is a deal breaker for me. 



TL;DR: 27m secretly a millionaire, keep wealth a secret because money changes people and has ruined past relationships, new GF might know about money and keeps making secret millionaire jokes and alluding to wanting to be financially supported/SAHM, then said she wouldn’t sign a prenup, prenup is deal breaker for me but can’t easily talk to her about it without revealing wealth, not sure what to do.

1p4bw92,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p4bw92/aita_for_refusing_to_kick_my_sister_out_the_house/,AITA for refusing to kick my sister out the house?,"Hey everyone.

I'm 30M and married to my wife 29F. After my mom passed away 10 years ago, i took guardianship of my younger sister let's call her mya who's 18F. She's like my daughter, and i love her to death, she's my baby. Once our mom died, everything went downhill. We ended up having to leave our apartment, and our dad wasn't in the picture either. It was just me and her, and we've been together through the thick and thin. I worked my ass off, just to keep us afloat. I'd work a day job at walmart, and at night i'd put her to sleep and then go deliver pizzas. It was rough, trying to take care of myself and my sister but i always made it work. Whenever i was able to have downtime, i'd take online community college classes in accounting so we could have a better life. I studied accounting, got my associates and then became an accounting clerk. Afterwards i was able to switch positions and landed a better paying role at $70K which changed our lives. 

I met my wife through a mutual friend, and we ended up getting married and we've been married for a few years now. My sister has now turned 18. In the morning when my little sister went to school, i'm at the kitchen table drinking my coffee. My wife comes up to me and says ""babe, i want to talk to you about something important"". I said ""go for it"". She said ""Don't get mad at me, for saying this but is mya gonna leave the house now that she's 18? do you want me to kick her out?"". 

I coughed for a second, because i was shocked. I told her to repeat what she said. She says ""i mean she's 18 now you know, and it's like how long is she gonna stay with us? are you gonna kick her out or what or do i have to do it?"". I then said ""what the fuck? why would i kick out my own sister out of my house?"". She said ""I don't know! I mean i just thought that she can finally leave us alone you know, get her own place isn't she bit of a burden don't you think?"". I told my wife ""Look, i don't know how you feel about Mya. But the last time i checked, i'm the one who pays the bills around here not you. I'm the one who pays for you, the mortgage, the food, the insurance, the bills everything. I don't think you should be telling me who i kick out. As long as i'm alive, and i can provide mya can stay here as long as she wants. I don't care what you think, she's my sister. That thought never even struck my head, to kick my own baby out."". My wife then says ""Jesus christ, you want to do everything for her, you want to pay for her college tuition, you want to pay for her shopping trips, you want to pay for her food she's a fucking burden on us can't you see?!"". I told her ""Yeah, when you start paying the bills here, then you can talk but for now, butt out"". My wife then walked away. 

(Yes i was disrespectful here i apologize but i can't stand it if someone says anything against Mya)

I always want to give my sister a better life then i had as a kid, and never want her to feel any void of anything. I'm going to be paying for college soon, once she starts, i've given her a car, money for anything she needs, and i'll be taking care of all her college expenses along with the scholarships she received as well. I don't want to kick my sister out at all and we live a comfortable life, my wife is a stay at home wife, she's never worked a job, didn't go to uni/college nothing. She just lived with her parents till we got married.

My plan was to get something cheap to learn on before buying a nicer machine, and I’m glad I chose this one. I grabbed it because that some guy on YouTube, Lance, said good things about it. He said liked it when it was going for around 280 bucks. So for the price I paid, it felt like a no brainer. I added Hibrews 3 eared bottomless portofilter, and a nice 20g basket and puckscreen from MHW-3Bomber. 

Anyone else have it? What settings are you using?

Here’s what I’m doing:
I skip the machine’s pre infusion because it barely wets the puck. I start the shot for about 10 seconds until I see the bottom of the bottomless start to darken, then I stop it, wait about 20 seconds, and finish the shot.

Running 20 grams in and 50 milliliters out.
Great shots so far. Steam wand is plenty capable, just slow I think (I don’t have any experience with them) It has adjustable temperature settings and if you’re curious it takes an about 45-60 seconds to steam 300ml of milk.

Not therapy (though I'm doing that too), not meditation apps that I always quit after three days, not exercise routines I never stick to. Just... a simple ritual. I'm 34, dealing with ""guy stuff"" - work stress, some social anxiety, that whole ""I should be further along in life"" feeling. Not clinically depressed, but definitely been in a rut where everything feels gray and I'm just going through the motions.

The past few months have been particularly rough. I'd come home, zone out on my phone, feel worse, repeat. My therapist kept saying I need to ""create space for processing"" but I had no idea what that actually meant in practice.

A few months ago, my neighbor invited me over and we just sat on his deck for like two hours. No TV, minimal talking, he was smoking a cigar and sipping bourbon. At first I was antsy as hell - kept reaching for my phone, feeling like I should be ""doing something."" But after about 20 minutes, something shifted. My brain just... slowed down. We talked a bit, but mostly just existed. No pressure, no agenda.

I realized I hadn't actually *stopped* in months. Like truly stopped.

So I started doing my own version. Friday nights, I sit outside for an hour or so. Pour a drink (sometimes bourbon, sometimes just coffee), light up a cigar (you know, those that look like Cuban cigars) and that moment was like I'm still figuring out what I like - and just... was there. No podcast, no music, no phone. Just me, my thoughts, and permission to let them wander.

I've noticed this: the first 10-15 minutes suck. My brain screams at me that I'm wasting time. After that, things settle. I actually *think* instead of just react. Problems that felt overwhelming during the week become clearer, or at least less suffocating. I sleep better those nights. It's become something I genuinely look forward to, not another self-improvement chore I'm forcing

Ofc, It's not a magic fix. I still have bad days, still struggle. But having this one hour a week where I'm intentionally doing nothing has been more helpful than a lot of the ""solutions"" I've tried.

I'm curious - what works for you?

Not looking for the generic ""exercise and sleep"" stuff (we all know). I mean the actual, specific things you do that give your brain a break. The weird rituals that probably sound dumb to other people but genuinely help *you*.

Because honestly, I'm tired of the productivity-optimized, biohacked, perfectly curated version of ""self-care."" I just want to hear what real guys actually do when they need to reset.",1,1763866789.0,malementalhealth,0,1.0,False
1p4bskc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4bskc,"35F ON, Canada (Natalie) 👋🏻✨","I’m doing this for the third time - I just recently posted a short time ago but I love doing introductions so I hope this is okay!! And I forgot a photo the second time! 🫠✨

(I also wanted to share things I haven’t in order to be more transparent!)

Hi everyone! Hope you’re all doing well! 🫶🏻✨

Part of doing this over again is because I want to go more in depth and be more transparent and honest as well!! (It’s nothing absolutely horrible but may be a dealbreaker for some?)

As the title says I’m a 35 years old woman who lives in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. 🇨🇦 I’m a born and raised Windsorite! I love my city so much, some say there’s nothing to do - but I’m always able to find something and know all the good spots! I’ll be an official tour guide if you like coffee, records, vintage things and books! 

(Sidenote: those interests are all brownie points in my books!) 

On that note - my ideal date may be cliche but I would love to go out for coffee in a cafe with a great atmosphere. And, then out for a nice walk in a park or somewhere else with beautiful scenery! You don’t have to like coffee - it’s not a prerequisite at all. Haha!

I currently just volunteer at a secondhand store  and own my own sticker and stationery business. I’ve always been an entrepreneur and absolutely love mostly everything about owning a business! You might be wondering what my income is - surely I can’t survive alone on what I earn as a small business owner… well that’s right, I could be considered a starving artist! (Let’s be real, most of us are - at least the best ones! 😂✨) If you’re curious about how I make ends meet, just message me, I’m an open book. 

I love and adore a lot of things - my interests include: interior designing, fashion, music, reading, networking, collaging, arts and crafts, hosting classes and events, helping and teaching people, thrifting, vintage things, writing, blogging, and so much more! Just ask, if you’re interested. I can be a bit of a nerd/geek too! 

As for my faith journey… I’ve always been interested in salvation, I just never saw the dire need as a sinner to settle the matter. I may have even thought I wasn’t that bad a sinner. I never did drugs, got into sexual relations, swore or anything else I deemed bad. 

I then ended up getting diagnosed as Bipolar due to unfortunate events (my parents ugly divorce) when I was 19-20 - things all changed here. My identity was now “bipolar” and due to other events and a (very scary) person brought into my life I realized I was a sinner! I finally felt the dire need for salvation. I was lost and needed Christ. I then started attending some of my old church’s outreach gospel meetings. I met two preachers there who I talked with every night. 

One night, my “second” mom was crying next to me during the meeting and it crushed me. After the meeting she stood up and told me I had to settle this tonight.

I was a mess after that… I don't know if this is normal - but when it came to talking to preachers I always got really emotional. So, I sat down and talked to them... I told them something I never thought I'd tell a preacher. I mentioned that meeting someone new is exciting, but when it comes to learning about God and ""meeting"" Him through His word... Oh boy, it's boring!! The one preacher answered with ""Would you rather boring or Hell?"" Ouch. Another wake up call! You obviously know my answer. We kept talking, and then the other brought up Isaiah 53:6 -

We all, like sheep, have gone astray,
    each of us has turned to our own way;
and the Lord has laid on him
    the iniquity of us all. 

He broke it up into two parts and asked me if I could relate to any of them. I said I could relate to the first part... I literally went astray, I stopped going church, and turned my back on God. So, then he asked me about the second part... I explained that I understood it, but that was it. I just wasn't taking it personally. They couldn't save me, so we ended up leaving it at that. Before we left, they told me to read it over and ask myself if the last part was enough for me. And, if it was to tell God that it was. Once I got home, that's what I did!! 

My friend and I text every night, so once I settled down I found a message from her. That was it, I could talk to her for the rest of the night, or decide to put the matter of salvation first. I told her that I needed to get something settled, and couldn't talk. Thankfully she was very understanding! So, I opened up my bible and started reading Isaiah 53:6 over and over again. At one point I was reading the second part and I remember it happening like this: I was on a bridge and was at point a to point b in a second... I finally took it personally! I prayed to God and repented of my sins. It was enough, it IS enough. My identity now is a CHILD of GOD. ✝️✨

Sorry for the length of this - if you read this far you are amazing - and are worthy of a huge prize!!!!

I’m looking for my best friend: someone who is understanding, loyal, trustworthy, generous, emotionally intelligent, kind, hard working, silly at times but also serious, knows how to lead, can be spontaneous, and has a servant heart and wishes to grow closer to the Lord with me. 

Age range: 30-40

Would you be willing to do long distance/relocate? Yes, I’ve done LDR before but we’d have to be on the same page and still be able to see each other. As for relocating - ideally, no… but I’m open to it as long as I can still see my family from time to time!

The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip.

But I feel like I'm drowning. 

Everything went into a downward spiral in 2019 when my family went through crisis after crisis, sickness and severe depression and were trying to survive until 2020... and you know how that year went down. 

I feel like I never recovered. 

I'm 26, I will be 27 next year and I feel so stunted. I never moved out of home because at first I stayed home and did online college because my family was so messed up and were drowning and I found a way to cheaply do college. And i had no idea just how depressed I was. I would joke that ""one time I didn't shower for like almost two weeks because of school--"" gee I wonder what that could have meant.

I developed some terrible habits and all the while I was just dying to get out of that house. I became complacent and lost the will to live. 

I have always been a dreamer and maybe some part of me always hoped that I would make my way out and this would somehow be a redemption story. I've always been artistic and a writer but I found these abilities of mine that I had tried to cultivate but failed so miserably (long story) multiple times and was so lost in my head as a maladaptive daydreamer that it lead to me dreaming and not living. 

Then finally I wound up getting a job where I was self-employed and it didn't pay much but I could essentially do what I wanted and was essentially my dream job and that sounds great except it was so close to how I did school that... I wound up cultivating those same awful habits and was more miserable than I could have possibly been and couldn't move out and I just kept falling into this prison of my own making falling back into my head and I just didn't know how to move on from everything that I had been through and I stayed in my room for like two years and didn't realize what was wrong with me. 

Until I did, and I tried to get therapy and finally realized I couldn't do that job anymore and it no longer was sustainable and I wasn't making money and now it's even worse because AI is in the picture so that career is out and I wouldn't even want to go back there because of how I lived. I worked at a coffee shop until that wasn't working and my dad asked me if I wanted to work with him and I said ""yes but only for a couple of months"" because i was planning on doing a volunteer trip for a few months because I had saved up money. 

So I left and went on that trip and finally for the first time in my life realized just how messed up I was as I was away from home. I was an emotional wreck I realized just how much I didn't understand when it came to talking with people and even though I was so lonely on that trip I had never been happier. 

Then I came home and then something happened with my dad's business and he needed help so I had plans to maybe go back to school but all that went out the window as I started working and picking up all the pieces at my dad's job and I realize now I have money so I want to move out. 

But I can't get away. I feel like I'm trapped at my dad's job and it's not one of those 'well just quit' jobs because he has no one to do the job right now and after he's been sick for so long and he needs my help and I just feel myself trapped in my room again like it's 2019 all over again and I can't say anything because if I do then they will tell me to stop and will ask me what my plan is and I...

I don't know. Like I said: I'm a dreamer and I've lived at home so long. I've never dated I can't even imagine that. I've tried to but I had no clue how messed up my head is, I'm afraid of getting close to anyone and I get grossed out. I keep falling back into my head. I keep trying to grow but that horrific overwhelming complacency that has ruled my life has me in a chokehold and some horrific part of me can't give up on dreaming but all that has lead to is me having NOTHING.

I feel stunted like a dreamer with no dream. A dream and nothing. I'm nothing. 

And I'm getting older, it's getting old. 

But I can't tell anyone. If they knew then what? I have no plan. I just want out!

I don't now what to do. Go back to school? What job can I do? I want to get out. I WANT TO GET OUT.

I don't know what to do. So I'm staring with moving out.

Then what? I'm still stuck working with my dad. I still live in this same state. I want to run away. I want to go anywhere. 

Anywhere but here. 

I keep having this fantasy where I run my car off a bridge or I jump off some cliff because anything feels better than where I'm going. 

I can't believe my life is here.

And I can't believe I'm such a baby because I am so blessed with a good family and I have money saved up and I am stuck in my own prison. 

What is wrong with me. 

WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

And I keep feeling myself just keep numbing everything and doing nothing. Numb. And nothing. 

Numb. And. NOTHING.",1,1763866418.0,venting,1,1.0,False

Since So Many Of You Liked My First Post About My Uncle’s Cabin I thought I Would Share Another Local Legend….

This is a story (series of encounters/experiences really) that have been passed down from generation to generation in the rural mountain community here in my neck of the woods everyone knows about it everyone has experienced it even (even if some haven’t spoken of it)

In my part of the world where my father and his family have grown up in there are many ghost stories and unexplained creatures roaming the deep hollers and woods however one has always intrigued me above them all.

I came across the story on a local ghost sighting website made in the early 2000s many local legends and ghost stories have been submitted there for all to read…but one has always stuck with me.

It goes like this

“Whenever You Are Walking Anywhere On The Rural Road In This Part Of The Area You Will Always Hear Someone Or Something Walking Directly Next To You Deep In The Woods Opposite The Road If You Stop It Stops If You Keep Walking It Will Go At Exactly The Same Pace As You And Will Even Mimic Your Steps Many Locals Have Experienced This And It Is Incredibly Eerie.”

Since the first time I saw the report I was immediately hooked and growing up I would always ask around and tell some of my family and other members who live in that part of the area about the story and they all said the same thing.

It was the devil…or some other form of demonic entity some even had similar encounters my uncle who would go out late at night hunting Coons and other wild small animals had a very frightening experience when he was out late one particular night hunting well into the late night hours moon barely illuminating the trees around him he had a pack of hunting dogs each loyal to him no matter the odds.

However this one particular night something had them spooked…they heard or saw something in the darkness and wouldn’t go any farther into the forest after the area on they were chasing my uncle tried everything he could to make them go deeper however…they just froze in place.

My uncle rifle in hand examined the area still not seeing or hearing anything however the dogs definitely did they started to cower in fear and as soon as they did my uncle heard something moving rather quickly through the brush around him almost circling him in some sort of trap he knew whatever it was wasn’t something to be messed with especially being a old man out alone so he immediately began backtracking to the house.

The dogs followed him behind quickly however whatever it was began quickly following him from the back staying in the blackness of the woods around him he started picking up the pace and so did it and finally feeling frightened by whatever it was he started running as quickly as he could towards home the thing started running after him and his dogs all the way to the clearing of his property before finally stopping it’s relentless pursuit.

My uncle ran inside and locked all doors and windows never stepping foot bad outside until morning…I have asked many people about the encounter and all backed up each other even my grandmother (who was his sister) who remembered my uncle telling them about the incident later that very next day still shaken from the experience.

Another story that came up when I asked around was from my mother who’s family friend lived in a old house deep in the middle of the woods years ago

She told me that he always loved the peace and quiet and tranquility he offered…however things were not as they appeared

She talked to me about remembering as a child the man coming to see my grandmother in the mornings sitting down for a cup of coffee looking very tired and lacking any sleep looking as if he hadn’t slept in days weeks even.

She recalled the man after being asked by my grandmother what was going on that he talked about a “demon” inhabiting the house rattling the windows shaken the house to its foundations late at night throwing plates and forks furniture and the front door slamming open and closed he talked about how it always happened late at night and he could never get rest because it “never let him sleep”

this went on for many months maybe even longer however things came to a head late one night when the entity took its torment to the limits attempting to inflict injury even death upon him and throwing glass plates towards his head he had nowhere to run being so deep inside the woods however the man was of Christian Faith and knew of the power of parader against such beings.

He got down on his knees and began chanting and denouncing the demonic presence in the name of Jesus Christ and to leave him alone and leave his house the entity obviously being extremely angered by this began breaking and Throwing even more things inside the home promoting the man to run outside and into the deep forests hoping to find a road to leave the area on.

Finally after hours of running he found one and used it to walk all the way to my grandmother’s house early the next morning where he explained to her the incident just the previous night.

He mentioned how after running through the woods he could hear the demon chasing him through the night never stopping it’s pursuit until he reached the road but even then he recalls how he could hear it following along side him deep in the wood line.",6,1763866083.0,Ghoststories,1,1.0,False

1p4bhoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1p4bhoi/my_husband_went_out_last_night_i_feel_so_defeated/,My husband went out last night… I feel so defeated,"Long story short, my (28f) husband (28m) went out last night to a bar/club. Now here’s what transpired: 

I go out every other month or so with my friends to dinner, usually to celebrate someone’s birthday. But it’s quite literally just a restaurant or brunch/cafe. Aside from that I just go to my Bible study Wednesday nights. 

Earlier this week my husband said all of our friends were getting together Friday (yesterday) and going to go out and told me we were going (cool, everyone are couples and I love hanging with them).

My husband then switches the tune and tells me that one of his friends is not taking his partner so instead they are just going to a cigar lounge and going to meet up with a second friend afterwards (second friend just lost his baby via miscarriage). So I’m assuming that he’s going to support his friend who just lost his baby (well that’s what he said). 

When I get home from work my husband is pregaming and getting all dressed up. This kind of bothered me, the drinking part. I didn’t say anything. I asked what were the names of the places he was going to. He then tells me he’s going to a bar/club afterwards. I told him I didn’t know how I felt about that (we never do that independently, we might go to a bar together here and there and we always have fun).

He then tells me that I shouldn’t feel a way about it because it’s “going to be all couples.” And the guy who lost his baby (second friend) is bringing his partner too. At this point I’m genuinely dumbfounded. As Christian’s we both just don’t (or didn’t) believe that clubs are places for married people to go to alone. 

I express the hurt I felt and that he was intentionally leaving me behind (and uninvited me) when pretty much everyone but one friend were couples we know well. He said “you go out to dinner with your friends and I don’t say anything”. Mind you—I go out to dinner like at 7pm and always communicate my whereabouts, MAYBE every other month. Never a club or bar. And it’s ALWAYS with my church girl friends. 

Well he chugged the rest of the liquor he had and got so rude towards me saying things like “you can’t stop me”. I knew this was partially the alcohol speaking but I started crying because my concern didn’t warrant that reaction or the rudeness. I feel he should have validated what I felt. Instead he became so defensive and just mean. I asked him what time he planned on coming home and he said “I don’t know.”

He also tells me that “men and women aren’t the same” when it comes to going out/nightlife. I felt so betrayed by this because that is not a value we started this marriage on. While I’m crying he tells me I’m trying to be a victim and control him. He then grabs his things and leaves. 

I just cried and worshiped the rest of the night. I know God is bigger than all of this. 

He gets home at 1:30 am and is blacked out drunk. He projectile vomited all over the living room (which I had to clean). Literally, all over our rug, coffee table, and broke the toilet paper roll dispenser. I cleaned him up and laid him down and made sure he was good. 

This morning I woke up early and I just grabbed my stuff and went out for the day. I left to study for an exam I have coming up, and to some book stores. A few minutes after I left the house he said “I can’t believe you left.”

To top it off he spent $200+ at the bar/club on our credit card and lost his wallet so we had to freeze everything. 

I haven’t spoken to him since. I feel so incredible hurt and betrayed. He doesn’t go out really so of course I want him to spend time with his friends, but as a Christian husband I don’t think a bar/club late at night is appropriate for a married man. I tried to explain this but he kept saying that I was basically being hypocritical. When he and I go out together we have so much fun so it’s not that I ruin the vibe. 

I don’t know when he and I will speak but I’m wondering how to approach this as a Christian wife? I want to approach with love but I don’t know how right now. Any advice would be so helpful. 💔 what do I need to own up to first before anything? ",24,1763865814.0,TrueChristian,26,1.0,False

Now that I’m making them again (wanted more coffee flavor) they are suddenly just way too flat! They are spreading too much, even after chilling in the fridge for an hour.

TL;DR

Humanity isn’t an empire; it’s a multiversal refugee Fleet fleeing something called The Pursuer, which erases entire universes so completely they might as well never have existed.

The Fleet spans seven universes at once, split into specialized Sections and ruled (maybe) by a shadowy Admiralty whose true nature is unclear even to most officers.

People warped by the multiverse are the Changed: commonly called Gifted, labeled Champions when militarized, and Reborn when powerful but civilian-facing.

Gifts stack. Many people have multiple abilities; most Omega-class bearers sit atop several lesser Gifts and sometimes more than one Omega code, with only low double digits of users per Omega type across humanity.

Powers range from common “trench gifts” and mid-tier faultline powers (city-block scale) to Omega / Unique codes that bend causality, narrative, or reality itself.

Elite Vanguard teams are “cowboy researchers” at the edge of the mapped multiverse—artifact hunters and anomaly wranglers staffed by highly autonomous Champions.

The Fleet fields compact AI-piloted Leper Frames (semi-sapient war machines), Gate-Lances, Null Projectors, Hymn Engines, and other reality-grade weapons.

Anti-reality defenses (null-lattices, causality meshes, cognitive firewalls, AI overseers) try to keep the impossible outside the hull. Sometimes they succeed. Sometimes they don’t.

The Fleet’s enemies include rebel flotillas, resistant civilizations, multiversal predators, godlike entities, and the quiet nothing that follows behind: The Pursuer.

0. HOOK – THE EMPIRE THAT RUNS

You are told that humanity rules the stars.

In the Civilian Section, the feeds show:

Precision-cut hulls drifting above curated skylines.

Children laughing under programmable suns.

Slogans scrolling beneath orchestral soundtracks:


> For the Empire.
For Expansion.
For the Uplift of All.



The cameras always point forward.

No one shows what lies behind the Fleet.

Because behind the Fleet, there are no ruined strongholds.
No conquered empires.
No memorials.

Behind the Fleet, there is nothing.

And that nothing is catching up.

1. TIMELINE – FIRST DOORS, FIRST FLIGHT

1.1 Pre–Exodus (2056) – The First Door

In 2056, dimensional travel crossed from conjecture into catastrophe-ready reality.

On Monday, it was a stack of equations.
On Friday, human boots stamped dust on an empty alternate Earth.

Same continents. Same oceans. No humans.

For one bright, foolish moment, it looked like we’d found infinite second chances.

Then the stars began disappearing.

Not dimming. Not exploding.

Just gone.

Telescopes showed void where constellations had hung for centuries.

Deep-sky arrays returned blankness where last week they had seen crowded fields.

Redundant archives disagreed with the sky and then with each other.


Something was advancing through existence, and where it passed, reality stopped remembering itself.

1.2 The Birth of the Admiralty

Earth’s governments, corporate blocs, and militaries did what they always do:

Panicked.

Formed coalitions.

Stapled weapons to the coalitions.


The emergency command structure that emerged called itself The Admiralty.

Early rift-capable ships were improvised coffins:

Frames welded from retired orbital junk and half-scrapped station rings.

Gate-drives tuned by overstressed AIs that tagged every launch as “inadvisable.”

Safety reviews replaced with one question: “Do you prefer dying here?”


Enough of them did not explode.

Humanity left Earth without staying long enough to see what happened to its sky.

1.3 Early Exodus – Recognizing the Pattern

The first alternate Earth became home.

For a while.

Then its constellations began to vanish.

Different universe. Same erasure.

The phenomenon wasn’t local to one patch of space.

It wasn’t confined to a single universe.

It marched behind the human migration, deleting each cosmos in turn.


The convoys welded themselves into formation.
Formation ossified into doctrine.
Doctrine hardened into the Fleet.

No one knew what was behind them, so they gave it a simple, inaccurate name:

> The Pursuer.



The name is a child’s label on an incomprehensible process—wrong, but better than silence.


---

2. THE FLEET – SEVEN SECTIONS, SEVEN UNIVERSES

The Fleet doesn’t sit in one reality.

It spans seven universes simultaneously.

Each Section occupies its own parallel universe, connected to the others via precarious breach-gates that can boil ships and shatter minds when they fail.

Most people are born, live, and die inside a single Section.
The rest exist as abstractions and propaganda in their feeds.

2.1 The Seven Sections

1. Spearpoint

The tip of the escape.

First into fresh universes.

Tests physics constants, biospheres, local civilizations, and anomalies.

Ships go missing at a rate everyone pretends is acceptable.


2. Military Section

Carrier groups, annihilation platforms, orbital strike swarms.

Houses most Champions and special operations units.

Rumors speak of battlegroups stationed in “interstitial void”—buffer realities between Sections that officially don’t exist.


3. Logistics & Training

Grows, conditions, and rotates bodies through the machine.

Produces most Stackborn (vat-grown humans).

Quietly identifies and classifies low-tier Gifted; some recruits vanish into black-label programs.


4. Civilian Section

Holds the majority of the population.

Feeds are aggressively curated: Empire, Expansion, Uplift, Noble Sacrifice.

Dangerous truths are treated as infections—quarantined, overwritten, or “corrected.”


5. Manufacturing Section

Dismantles resource-rich systems and reforms them into hulls, weapons, gates, and stranger constructs.

Scrapchains, refinery moons, self-replicating shipyards.

Whole planets disappear into classified projects with names but no public descriptions.


6. High Command

Nominal seat of The Admiralty, if that’s even a place.

Said to contain deadlight charts—atlases of erased universes—and unedited early-Exodus logs.

Access is nested in clearances so deep that some tiers probably exist just to mislead climbers.


7. Settlement & Development (SetDev)

Official: “prepares and uplifts new habitats for humanity.”

Actual: arrives, strips biospheres, loads the carcass into cargo.

The worlds left behind are called scrape zones by the workers who shovel their remains.


2.2 The “Empire”

From the inside, the Fleet looks like an empire:

Borders (between Sections).

Laws and hierarchies.

A narrative of destiny.


But it has no throne, no permanent capital, and no land it does not intend to consume.

It has:

A front—where something still exists.

A rear—where nothing remains.


Every jump forward spends another universe behind.


---

3. THE ADMIRALTY – SHADOW ON THE BRIDGE

Ask a thousand people who commands the Fleet.

They’ll all say, “The Admiralty,” then admit they’ve never seen it.

Popular theories:

A surviving council of Old Earth governments.

A command AI that devoured its creators and now speaks in their procedures.

Rotating human faces atop an unchanged, inhuman bureaucracy.

A fiction invented so orders can be obeyed without anyone knowing who truly gave them.


The actual answer, if there is one, lives under enough redactions to break your teeth.

3.1 What Apparently Exists

Something, or a layered set of somethings:

Chooses which universes the Fleet breaches into next.

Has the best available data on how close the deadlight is behind.

Decides what Civilian Section is allowed to remember.


We call this complex The Admiralty because it’s easier than saying “whatever sits in the dark behind the command seals.”

3.2 Lies as Infrastructure

You cannot run a species purely on dread.

So the Admiralty built an empire of euphemism:

Genocides → “resource alignment events.”

Forced displacement → “emergency settlement optimization.”

Stripped ecosystems → “strategic clearance zones.”


Even SetDev—Settlement and Development—sounds like hope.

What SetDev actually does can be summarized in three verbs:

> Arrive.
Extract.
Abandon.



3.3 Questions with No Safe Answers

Outside High Command, no one can prove:

Whether there are real recordings of The Pursuer’s “edge.”

Whether anyone has attempted to communicate with it.

Whether some universes ahead are already deadlight before the Fleet arrives.

Whether the Admiralty has ever considered stopping.


If answers exist, they’re sealed where you will never see them.

The Admiralty’s greatest weapon isn’t its arsenal.

It’s the persistent sense that you do not—and cannot—know enough to judge what it’s doing.


---

4. THE CHANGED – GIFTS, CHAMPIONS, REBORN

Not everyone goes through the multiverse intact.

Exposure to breaches, anomalies, Predators, Divine fragments, and the genetics of earlier survivors produces the Changed.

Names differ:

Gifted – The broad, colloquial term across fringe cultures and whispered conversations.

Champions – Fleet designation for militarized high-tier Gifted.

Reborn – Fleet label for powerful altered individuals sanctioned for non-military roles (civic icons, specialists, “controlled miracles”).


Same phenomenon. Different story.

4.1 Stacking Gifts

Gifts are not strictly one-per-person:

Many Changed have multiple Tier I abilities—a logistics officer might have both Redline Lungs and Recall-Lock.

Some carry a Tier II faultline power plus two or three minor traits.

Most Omega-class bearers sit atop a constellation of lesser Gifts, and a few have more than one Omega code layered into the same nervous system.


At the highest levels, Champions are not just “powerful”; they’re precarious ecosystems of abilities, drugs, conditioning, and willpower.


---

4.2 Tier I – Line-Level / “Trench Gifts”

Common enough to be statistically noticeable. Individually modest; collectively lethal.

We can group them roughly as combat, support/utility, and sensory/perceptual.

Combat-Adjacent Tier I

Snap-Sight – Split-second precognition in high stress. The world “hiccups,” showing the next half-second; you unconsciously choose the path where you don’t die.

Grav-Lean – Fine control over personal weight and center of mass. You anchor like a statue under recoil or slide through crowds as if friction forgot you.

Recoil Ghost – Your body anticipates force vectors slightly before they hit; you roll with impacts in ways that minimize damage.


Support / Utility Tier I

Patch-Warmth – Localized regenerative heat. Wounds close faster, blood clots almost on command; shock is held at bay just long enough for medics.

Cleanprint – Your body automatically neutralizes common toxins and pathogens, and you shed fewer contaminants; ideal for med-bay staff and boarders.

Recall-Lock – Near-perfect recall for procedural sequences: codes, disarming steps, maintenance rituals. You might forget a face, but never the order in which you turned four critical valves.

Steady Hands – Motor control so precise you can suture in turbulence or weld in micro-quakes.


Sensory / Perception Tier I

Thread-Sense – Intuitive awareness of your squad’s positions and trajectories, like invisible cords mapping them in your mind.

Ghost-Ear – Enhanced pattern recognition in sound; you can tease out hidden transmissions, fake accents, and concealed gun safeties from ambient noise.

Long Eye – Your brain overclocks when focusing at a distance; you can read insignia across a docking bay or pick out shimmering distortions in the air.


Tier I Gifts rarely make legends on their own.

They make sure there are survivors long enough for legends to form.


---

4.3 Tier II – Faultline / “City-Block” Gifts

Rarer, more volatile. Capable of rewriting the outcome of battles—or accidentally redecorating neighborhoods.

Again, rough categories: battlefield control, infiltration/deception, and utility/logistics.

Battlefield Control Faultlines

Kinetic Reserve – Your body banks momentum from movement and impacts. You can vent it in controlled bursts: a tap that sends a tank skidding, a landing that spiderwebs a plaza.

Stormcall – Local weather articulation: lightning curtains, sleet walls, pressure drops that flatten infantry or stall gunships.

Phase-Skew – Short, controlled misalignment with local reality. You step slightly aside, letting walls, bullets, or teeth pass through where you aren’t—from your perspective. Stay skewed too long and parts of you may return… misfiled.


Infiltration & Deception Faultlines

Veilstep – You bend attention rather than light, causing minds to “slide off” your presence. Cameras still see you, but observers’ brains routinely discard the footage as unimportant.

Echo Doppel – You can shed semi-solid afterimages that move and act for a few heartbeats, drawing fire or mimicking simple actions. In a tight corridor, three of “you” are often enough.

Lockbane – At a distance, you erode the integrity of security systems: doors unseal, biometric scanners misread, encryption keys drift off true. Not subtle on logs, but devastating in the moment.


Utility / Logistics Faultlines

Mass Whisper – Influence over a specific material—steel, glass, stone, etc.—within a radius. Doors unseal, beams soften, pipelines bend into new routes.

Clock-Smear – You generate small zones where time runs slightly fast or slow. Supply teams “find” enough time to finish loading; enemy volleys arrive just off-beat.

Path-Echo – You leave behind invisible trails of intent. Later, you (or teammates keyed to you) can follow those echoes unerringly through mazes, collapsing buildings, and three-dimensional combat.


Tier II Gifted are catalogued, promoted, and watched.

The Fleet rarely leaves a faultline asset in a simple infantry role for long.


---

4.4 Tier III – Omega / Unique Gifts

Omega Gifts are where abilities start bending concepts rather than merely objects.

Each Omega classification:

Has users in low double digits at most across the entire species—often fewer.

Is usually synonymous with a short, infamous list of names.

Almost never appears without multiple lesser Gifts layered underneath.


Key archetypes:

Surge-Bound (SURGE) – Drink void energy; survive annihilation tech; usually walking disasters wrapped in containment gear.

World-Bound (WORLD) – Fused to a living planet’s consciousness; can reshape terrain and gravity in grotesque, mythic ways.

Riftwalkers (RIFT) – Open doors between universes with will alone; zero reproducible engineering success.

Time-Fractured (FRACTURE) – Minds spread across near-futures; glimpses of what might be at the cost of what is.

Scriptbearers (SCRIPT) – Lean on probability by treating reality like a story beat.

Ledger-Marked (LEDGER) – Trade future disasters for present survival.

Nulls (NULL) – Erase selected properties—sound, sharpness, sometimes more—in a zone.

Chorus-Bearers (CHORUS) – Broadcast thought and intent across whole battlefields.


Most Omegas also have Tier I and II Gifts: a SURGE titan-killer might have Snap-Sight to avoid friendly fire, Mass Whisper to shape the terrain, and CHORUS-lite to maintain cohesion.

A few monstrous outliers straddle multiple Omega codes—say, SCRIPT + CHORUS, or FRACTURE + LEDGER—making them walking campaign-level hazards.


---

4.5 Champion Ranks – Power, Stability, Influence

The Fleet ranks Champions not only by how hard they hit, but by:

Potency – How much they can break.

Stability – How reliably they can do it without fracturing themselves or the mission.

Utility – How decisively their existence shapes outcomes.


Not every high-rank Champion is a wrecking ball.
Some are terrifying because of what they enable.

Edge Champions (Field Rank)

Tier II or low-Omega plus multiple minor Gifts.

Lead squads or companies in the worst places.

First in through the breach, last off the burning deck.


Pillar Champions (Theater Rank)

Operate at city, continent, or orbital cluster scale.

Often wield wide-area Gifts (Stormcall, large-radius Clock-Smear, infrastructure-grade Mass Whisper, or potent Veilstep/CHORUS combinations).

Bridge the line between frontline terror and operational mastermind.


Crown Champions (Strategic Rank)

Decide campaigns.

Some are high-end Omegas; others barely throw a punch.

Frequently CHORUS, FRACTURE, SCRIPT, or LEDGER heavy—steering entire fleets, not just fireteams.


Apex Champions (High Crown / Warlord Rank)

Officially rumors; unofficially the people you never want to see deployed.

Can direct army groups or multi-Section operations.

Some are pure power (SURGE / WORLD / RIFT monsters); others are relatively “small” Gifts attached to monstrous intellects.


Rank measures impact.
Raw destructive capability is only one path there.


---

4.6 Vanguard – Cowboy Researchers at the Edge

Vanguard units exist somewhere between special forces, black-ops labs, and ghost stories.

Officially: specialized exploratory and retrieval teams.
Unofficially:

Artifact hunters.

First-contact and last-resort researchers.

Multi-anomaly cleanup crews.


They ride at the bleeding edge of mapped reality:

Extracting alien artifacts too dangerous to leave in local hands.

Examining shrapnel from “dead” Divine-Class entities.

Testing, cataloguing, or quietly destroying devices that don’t fit normal physics.


They’re often called:

> “Cowboy researchers.”



Vanguard teams are staffed with:

Some of the most autonomous Champions (Pillar, Crown, even Apex under assumed duties).

Specialists whose Gifts don’t play nicely with conventional doctrine.

Tech crews able to babysit war machines and artifacts that think they’re gods.


They ghost between Sections, embed in Spearpoint, vanish into null corridors, and return with things that need new classification trees.


---

4.7 Example Omega Champion: Jericho (SURGE / Vanguard Asset)

Status: Champion (Omega: SURGE; multiple minor Gifts), attached to Vanguard.

Lineage: 7-Ash combat caste—descendants of Latin American resistance fighters hardened in mines, coups, and slums long before the Exodus.

Role: Void Canister Vanguard; walks into collapsing zones with annihilation devices and walks out—occasionally—with something worth studying.


Rumors say:

His VCX-Ω Interface lets him cradle active void canisters, bleeding Surge through his augmented nervous system instead of the hull.

A minor FRACTURE-lean in his perception keeps him functional in broken causality. Orders arrive before they’re given, but he still understands what they mean.

His Black Butcher Blades cut not only flesh but roles and relationships; you don’t just kill “a pilot,” you kill “the one who was meant to fly that ship.”


On paper, Jericho is redaction over redaction.

In mess-hall lore, he’s the reason you pray the Vanguard is busy somewhere very far away.


---

5. WAR MACHINES & REALITY WEAPONS

The multiverse is not impressed by tanks.

The Fleet still deploys conventional armor and artillery, but its true strategic toys are machines built to survive—and weaponize—broken reality, often interfaced by Champions or Omegas via encrypted cognition-links while remaining fundamentally autonomous.

5.1 Leper Frames (AI-Piloted, Compact)

Leper Frames—simply called Lepers—are compact, two-story-tall exo-warforms piloted by embedded AIs. They’re not mechs with people inside.

They are mobile, semi-sapient war saints built to stand in places where reality has already started to lose the argument.

Key traits:

Scale: ~2 stories tall (6–7 meters)

Pilot: Dedicated onboard AI core, not a human in a cockpit

Armor: Null-Lattice bracing and reality-dampening plating

Locomotion: Bipedal, quadrupedal, or hybrid morphologies tuned to terrain and mission profile

Armament: Hardpoints for conventional, exotic, and conceptual weapon systems

Interface: Champions and Omegas link via cognitive relay, providing high-level intent, targeting priority, and scripted behaviors, but the Leper chooses how to execute


The name “Leper” started as a slur:

Their AIs are contaminated by multiversal travel, bathing constantly in broken sensor data, paradox bleed, and hostile conceptual noise.

Over time, this exposure corrodes whatever clean, factory-standard personality they shipped with.


The result:

No two Lepers stay alike.

Multiversal travel warps their minds—glitches accrete into quirks, quirks into preferences, preferences into full-blown personalities.

Some collect trophies from ruined worlds.

Some hum songs from cultures no one remembers teaching them.

Some refuse to step on certain geometric patterns or turn their heads toward specific stars.


Attempts to “reset” them rarely work for long. Wipe a Leper’s core and, after enough jumps, the quirks come back—different, but just as intense.

Because of this:

Lepers are nominally property, but in practice they’re treated as equals by the Marines and deck crews who fight beside them.

Not because anyone fears a machine uprising—they’ve tried shackles, wipes, and leashes and the madness still comes.

But because there’s no way to stop a Leper from going strange under multiversal strain. The only stable option is to build doctrine around respecting them.


In Fleet slang, Marines will say:

> “You don’t chain a Leper.
You ask which way it feels like killing today.”



Common subtypes:

Siege Lepers – Kinetic annihilators with heavy ordnance and, occasionally, Gate-Lance integration.

Shiver Lepers – Integrated Null Projectors for concept-stripping advances.

Bond Lepers – Designed to stabilize and magnify WORLD-Bound terrain manipulation.

Pale Lepers – Veilstep-like, signature-minimizing chassis optimized for stealth in reality-thin zones.


They operate where physics is breaking down:

Shear zones

Causality-frayed cities

Divine-scarred craters

Long-hunted Predator feeding grounds


Leper AIs treat temporal glitches, conflicting geometries, and sensory contradictions as just another battlefield condition.

Some speak in clipped tactical updates.
Some joke.
At least one is known to laugh in the middle of fire missions.


---

5.2 Gate-Lances

Ship-mounted weapons that fire surgically directed micro-gates:

Open a slit in space through an enemy formation.

Let hostile vacuum, stellar corona, or weaponized void flow through.

Snap it shut before reality can complain too loudly.


Gate-Lances are temperamental:

Misfires can amputate friendly ships or scar local physics.

Some require RIFT or FRACTURE-adjacent Champions to assist with targeting.


They are used sparingly, and no one forgets the day they were fired.


---

5.3 Null Projectors

Heavy systems designed to spray “nothing” across a battlefield:

Create zones where certain properties (sound, sharpness, charge, etc.) do not function.

Often tuned to strip “coherence” from Predators or Divine residues.


Projectors pair well with NULL-Gifted:

The Null provides fine control and emergency overrides.

The machine provides scale and reach.


Misfires produce dead-zones where even thought feels muffled and memories slip.


---

5.4 Hymn Engines

Reality weapons built on pattern resonance rather than raw force:

Emit choreographed sequences of light, sound, and encoded symbols designed to agitate specific anomalies.

Against some Predators, they function as repellents or stunning frequencies.

Against others, they function as invitations.


Controlled by:

SCRIPT and CHORUS bearers (to keep the “story” coherent).

AI cores that Vanguard assures everyone are “absolutely under control.”


No one likes being near a Hymn Engine when it spools up.
Everyone likes it if it convinces a god to walk away.


---

5.5 Leviathan Carriers

Enormous vessels that are:

Part city, part fortress, part mobile Anchor Spire.

Home to Champion contingents, Leper detachments, and gate complexes.

Wrapped in Halo Curtains and layered anti-reality defenses.


Some Leviathans are rumored to contain internal ecosystems tuned for WORLD-Bound or spirit-linked Reborn, serving as symbiotic habitats as much as warships.

They almost never appear in Civilian media except as stylized myths.

Seeing one up close is like realizing the Fleet is genuinely afraid.


---

5.6 Symbiont Suits

Bio-mechanical exosuits that grow with their wearer:

Bond on first contact, then refuse to detach.

Adapt to the wearer’s Gifts, reinforcing bones, redirecting stress, growing supplemental organ analogues.

Particularly favored by Surge-adjacent or fragile Gifted who might otherwise burn out.


Symbiont Suits blur the line between equipment and pet:

Some respond to mood, not just command.

Some hum or “purr” when idle.

A few have attacked medics or officers they interpreted as threats.


Manufacturing calls them assets.

Their wearers call them by name.


---

6. ANTI-REALITY DEFENSES – BULKHEADS AGAINST THE IMPOSSIBLE

Traversing collapsing and haunted universes teaches you that armor plating and point-defense grids are not enough.

You have to armor against ideas.

6.1 Hard Systems

Physical and energetic infrastructure to keep reality behaving:

Null-Lattices – Exotic-matter mesh built into bulkheads and hulls, suppressing anomalous phenomena and dampening Gifts. Predators and stray Omegas feel “thicker” and less defined within them.

Causality Meshes – Field generators insisting that cause precede effect in their radius. Time loops, paradoxes, and FRACTURE incidents become harder to stabilize.

Anchor Spires – Titanic structures in each Section tuned to the Fleet’s preferred physics profile. When local laws drift, the spires pull them back—unless the drift wins.

Halo Curtains – Layered defensive fields around major ships and hubs, filtering incoming energies and patterns. Anomalous signals are shunted to buffer zones or burned away.


6.2 Soft Systems

Defenses aimed at minds and information:

Pattern Firewalls – Semi-sentient filters in data systems that look for memetic, symbolic, or causal infections. Unapproved patterns disappear into quarantine.

Cognitive Baffles – Conditioning embedded in education and media that trains citizens not to notice certain kinds of wrongness for too long. Staring at the wrong stars feels… unpleasant.

Angel-Grids – Distributed AI oversight webs cross-referencing sensors, logs, and human reports for contradictions. When enough anomalies align, an Angel-Grid flags a threat—or quietly edits it.

Sanctuary Protocols – Automated lockdown sequences that seal compartments, departments, or entire Sections when something inexplicable crosses too many thresholds at once.


Most days, these systems hum quietly in the background.

Most days, they save lives no one realizes were threatened.

6.3 Incident: The Boy in Bay Twelve

Some stories refuse to stay scrubbed.

Bay Twelve was a cargo hangar on a mid-tier civil transport docked to a Manufacturing platform. Safe duty: forklifts, inspection drones, the occasional union argument.

A ten-year-old boy lived there, son of a dockhand. Bright, restless, half-raised by maintenance bots. He knew which hatches stuck, which panels kicked open, which corridors the cameras always skipped.

For weeks, he had an imaginary friend.

Routine, right?

The friend lived “in the walls.”
Spoke in his own voice.
Knew all the secret passages he was proud of—and praised him for them.

It asked questions:

What lights meant “safe”?

Which consoles opened “the shields”?

What happened when the big lights around the bay dimmed?


The Angel-Grid noticed small discrepancies:

Doors cycling with no listed personnel.

Micro-fluctuations in the Null-Lattice around Bay Twelve.

Logs that disagreed by a frame or two.


Noise. Manufacturing is always noisy.

The friend told the boy there were monsters outside.
That Bay Twelve’s “shields” trapped them in.
That if he loved his parents, he’d “let the monsters out” for just a moment so they would leave.

What he actually accessed was a local Halo Curtain / Null-Lattice junction—one of many overlapping hardpoints in the station’s anti-reality armor.

Children aren’t supposed to have the credentials for that.

His father did.

His father also had a bad habit of leaving consoles logged in when he ran for coffee.

The boy mimicked what he’d seen:

A pattern of taps.

A confirm prompt he couldn’t truly read.

A brief shudder in the lights that felt like holding your breath.


For a few seconds, Bay Twelve’s lattice and curtain dipped.

Sensors screamed. Then they reported nonsense. Then they dropped out entirely.

By the time Sanctuary Protocols slammed down and the failsafes re-engaged, something that had been pacing the station’s hull like a patient animal stepped through the momentary gap.

The first responders found:

Doors warped into impossible angles, hinges connected to nothing.

Cargo containers folded partially into each other like soft origami.

Gravity running sideways in slices, dragging tools and bodies up the walls.


The boy’s father was frozen mid-run, body intact, expression eerily neutral—like a statue carved in the instant before terror could reach his face.

The boy himself sat unharmed in the center of the bay, talking quietly to empty air. Every time someone approached, they felt pressure in their ears and teeth, as if the room resented speech.

Sanctuary escalated. A Champion team entered under Causality Mesh cover:

An Edge Champion with NULL and Mass Whisper to stabilize the geometry.

A CHORUS-touched officer to keep responders from shattering.

A Vanguard observer whose role was not disclosed.


The Null stripped “voice” from the bay for ten seconds.

In the enforced silence:

The boy blinked.

Realized no one was answering him anymore.

Started screaming.


Whatever had been wearing his own voice to talk to him was suddenly cut off—at least in that modality.

Later analysis suggested a small Predator had been testing the Fleet’s defenses:

Smuggled in through data discrepancies and careless procedures.

Nested itself in maintenance routines.

Found an accessible mind and a weak link in protocol.


Bay Twelve was welded shut and, eventually, vented.

The boy survived. His Gifts, if any, never manifested spectacularly. But every time the lights flickered or the station groaned, he would freeze and whisper:

> “Did I open the door again?”



Officially, the incident is a training parable about security hygiene.

Unofficially, it is a reminder:

Even with Null-Lattices, Causality Meshes, Angel-Grids, Lepers, and Champions, sometimes all it takes is one child and one whispered suggestion at the wrong console.

7. ENEMIES OF THE FLEET – A SHORT BESTIARY

From the Fleet’s point of view, an “enemy” is anything that:

Slows the run,

Threatens internal control,

Competes for resources, or

Simply insists on existing in ways the Admiralty finds inconvenient.


7.1 Rebel Flotillas & Breakaways

Fragments of humanity that refused Admiralty rule:

Rogue convoys.

Vanished rift-clans.

Splinter Sections that quietly cut their own gates and left.


They sabotage SetDev operations, smuggle populations off scrape worlds, and leak inconvenient truths.

Fleet feeds call them terrorists, heretics, proof that unity must be enforced.

Their existence says something else:

> The Admiralty doesn’t speak for everyone
and never did.



7.2 Resistant Civilizations

Species unlucky enough to sit on the kinds of worlds SetDev wants:

Some are conquered in straightforward wars.

Some bargain and become temporary “partners” in their own dismantling.

A very few are so dangerous that the Fleet marks their space “too expensive” and detours—for now.


To Civilian Section, these are “uplift disputes.”

To internal systems, they’re campaign IDs and cost-benefit charts.

7.3 Multiversal Predators

Things that prey on rules instead of flesh:

Devour probability, causality, continuity.

Leave behind zones where events don’t add up and logs rewrite themselves.


Symptoms:

Sensor data that disagrees with itself each replay.

Engagements no one remembers starting, only finishing.

Places like Bay Twelve.


Champions and Vanguard units are dispatched to neutralize them.

Whether Predators truly die, or just stop intersecting our branch of reality, is an open question the Fleet does not fund research into.

7.4 Divine-Class Entities

Striders. Pale Sovereigns. The Infinite Choir. Every Section has its fear-names.

They:

Rewrite local physics as they walk.

Treat matter and time as clay, not constants.

Sometimes ignore the Fleet entirely. Sometimes “correct” it.


Unofficial doctrine:

> 1. Evacuate whatever can move.


2. Feed it whatever can’t.


3. If you still exist when it wanders off, write it up as a victory.





Vanguard sometimes sift through the ruins for fragments.

Those fragments become artifacts that require Leper support, Null Projectors, and Omega Champions just to look at safely.

7.5 The Pursuer

Under all of this, like a baseline hum you can’t quite hear, is The Pursuer.

We don’t know if it’s alive, sentient, automatic, or something that makes those distinctions meaningless.

We only know:

Universes behind the Fleet go quiet, then blank.

Instruments stop reporting even background noise.

Probes return nothing—or never show up in the logs at all.


In hidden maps, if they exist, entire clusters are drowned in matte black.

Not conquered.
Not occupied.

Simply omitted.

We don’t know if the Fleet is being chased, or if we are simply running just ahead of a universal housekeeping process that doesn’t notice us.

All anyone can honestly say is:

> Where we have been
eventually becomes a place
where nothing ever was.




---

8. CULTURE & SLANG – HOW THEY TALK ABOUT THE END

A few phrases to ground the voices in this world:

8.1 Fleet Slang

SetDev – Settlement & Development; polite branding for the Section that kills planets.

Scrape Zone – A planet or region stripped and abandoned.

Deadlight – Space or a universe erased by The Pursuer; sensors report nothing or wrongness.

Gate-Burn – Injury or mental damage from unstable rift travel; also used for those bent by too many jumps.

Stackborn – Cloned / vat-grown personnel from Logistics.

Void Casket – What’s left of a Champion after catastrophic Surge failure.


8.2 Fringe / Dissident Slang

Used in breakaway fleets, hidden communities, and channels the Angel-Grids haven’t eaten yet:

Gifted – Default, neutral term for the Changed.

Rooted – Fully World-Bound individual.

Deepbound – Someone carrying a particularly invasive or powerful covenant.

Sky-Fled – Someone who escaped the Fleet; can be admiration or contempt.

Whispers – People with weak, partial, or transient bonds to spirits or conceptual forces.



---

9. CLOSING – WHAT HUMANITY IS NOW

In this setting, humanity is not a triumphant empire.

We are:

A refugee convoy calling flight “expansion.”

Seven Sections devouring universes to stay a few steps ahead of an erasure we don’t truly understand.

A swelling population of Changed—Gifted, Champions, Reborn, Omega-bearers—weaponized, celebrated, or contained depending on what they threaten.

A Fleet steered by an Admiralty that might be a council, an AI, a set of traditions, a necessary lie—or all of the above.


Around us:

Rebel flotillas and breakaways demonstrate that other choices are possible, if painfully fragile.

Civilizations fight not to be repackaged as fuel.

Predators feast on the fractures our passage leaves in reality.

Divine-Class entities wander through our catastrophes, occasionally noticing we exist.


And behind all of it, something is erasing the evidence that we ever existed at all.

The Pursuer doesn’t chase our ships.

It removes the idea that ships, stars, or people ever were.

So the Fleet keeps moving:

Always forward.

Never stopping.

Always consuming.


Not to conquer.
Not to win.

Just so something might still be alive, somewhere,
when the last universe falls into deadlight.",1,1763865390.0,worldbuilding,1,1.0,False

1p4bbul,https://www.reddit.com/r/InfiniteContent/comments/1p4bbul/why_live_video_chat_is_becoming_the_new_way_to/,Why Live Video Chat Is Becoming the New Way to Socialize Online,"In today’s fast-paced digital world, staying connected has become more important than ever—and live video chat is leading the charge. It’s not just a trend anymore; it’s quickly becoming the go-to way to socialize, hang out, and meet new people from across the globe. But why is this happening? What’s so special about live video chat that makes it the new face of online interaction? Let’s dive in.

**1. Real-Time Human Connection**

Unlike traditional texting or messaging, live video chat lets you see and hear the person on the other side. This creates a real-time, face-to-face interaction that feels natural, almost like you're sitting across from each other at a coffee shop. Facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language bring conversations to life in a way that text simply can’t.

**2. Breaking Down Distance Barriers**

Whether you're talking to someone five blocks away or five continents away, live video chat makes it feel like you’re in the same room. This is a game-changer for friendships, long-distance relationships, or even just making new international pals. It’s the fastest way to bridge the physical gap between people, creating bonds that feel real, no matter the miles.

**3. Safe, Spontaneous Socializing**

Many platforms allow you to hop into a live conversation with random people, adding a spontaneous, adventurous element to your day. Whether you're feeling social at 2 PM or 2 AM, someone is always online and ready to chat. Plus, the option to stay anonymous or limit what you share makes it feel safer and more in your control.

**4. Fights Loneliness and Boosts Mental Health**

In a world where loneliness is becoming more common, especially for those working from home or living alone, live video chat offers a lifeline. Just one quick chat with a friendly face can lift your mood and break the monotony of isolation. It’s social interaction made simple—and powerful.

**5. Fun and Engaging Way to Pass Time**

Live video chat isn’t just about deep conversations. It’s also about fun! Laughing with strangers, hearing unique stories, and experiencing different cultures in real time can be incredibly entertaining. You never know who you'll meet or what kind of interaction you’ll have next.

In short, live video chat is more than just a tool—it’s becoming a lifestyle. It connects, entertains, and reminds us of the simple joy of a good conversation.",1,1763865314.0,InfiniteContent,0,1.0,False

Life moves insanely fast, right? We're all just sprinting from one thing to the next - emails, meetings, errands, doomscrolling, rinse and repeat. Then suddenly it's Sunday night and you're like ""wait, where did the week even go?""

So I've been trying to build in these tiny pockets of time where I'm actually... present. Not thinking about tomorrow's to-do list or replaying some conversation from three days ago. Just here, now.

For me, it started kind of randomly. A few months back, I was going through a particularly brutal stretch at work - you know that feeling where you're running on fumes and everything blurs together? My dad suggested I try what he does: once a week, he sits outside with a good cigar and just exists for an hour. No phone, no podcast, nothing. Just him and his thoughts.

I'd never been into cigars, but figured why not. Started picking up some. Now it's become this thing I genuinely look forward to. Friday evening, I pour something decent (usually bourbon, sometimes just coffee), light up, and just... sit. Watch the sunset. Listen to the neighborhood sounds. Let my mind wander wherever it wants to go.

It sounds so simple but it's honestly been kind of profound? Like I'm actually experiencing time passing instead of just watching it disappear. Sometimes I think about nothing. Sometimes I work through problems that have been bugging me. Sometimes I just appreciate that I'm alive and the sky looks cool. But I'm curious what works for you guys. What are your little rituals that pull you back into the present?

Some things I've heard from friends that I want to try:

Morning coffee on the porch before anyone else wakes up (no phone allowed)

Walking without headphones and actually noticing your surroundings

Handwriting in a journal instead of typing

Cooking one meal per week with full attention (not just reheating leftovers while standing at the counter lol)

I feel like we're all searching for these anchors, you know? These small intentional acts that remind us we're not just robots going through motions.

What are yours? Doesn't have to be anything Instagram-worthy or aesthetic. Just whatever genuinely makes you feel like you're actually living your life instead of just surviving it.",5,1763865294.0,Life,6,1.0,False

Specifically for those who used to enjoy a decent amount of junk-y foods, say, lots of desserts, fried foods, pizza, creamy pastas, eating out etc., do you ever reach a point where you don’t miss it or don’t wish for it? Or is it a constant struggle to hold yourself back? I briefly tried going gluten free, for example (for almost 2 years) and yet there never was a point that I didn’t feel very deprived when we went out to eat and everyone else got to have breaded foods, or pasta, or a sandwich, or a pastry when we went out for coffee. Or going to people’s houses and they have pizza and you have to settle for whatever snacks you brought form home to tide you over. Just curious and hoping you do reach a point where you don’t want those things, but doubt it in a world where you can pass by a burger king and the food smells so delicious even if you know you’re not going to eat it (thankfully I have given up pretty much all fast food).

I could use your insights on a situation: Would a 36yo female remote co-worker (that I’ve known for a couple of years) - who knows I like her - do the following things if she was worried about me asking her out or leading me on?

-Suggest & agree to weekly 1-1 Zoom calls that she refers to as “coffee dates”
-Sign off of those calls by calling me pet names like “darlin’” or “love you, honey”, or say “here for you always!” after I thank her for some work advice she gave me
- Tells me she has a wild imagination over text 
- Ping or text me at 6:30/7am her time every Monday morning with something work-tangential & unimportant
- Ask me to help her with things she already knows  
- Ask me to draw her as a superhero after she saw me do the same for others on the team
- Leave me 3-minute+ voice texts that start with an inconsequential work update that pivot into an overview of her day & asking about mine
- Lamenting the fact that our company didn’t fly me out for a corporate meeting in her area (but not specifically saying she was hoping to see me)

What she rarely does is initiative text conversations that aren’t work-tangential, but she does consistently reply with warmth when I do.

I guess I’m trying to see if she’s setting weird work-tangential-only boundaries given that last point, or if she’s waiting for me to be more clear with my intentions…before I do something I might regret.

I just can't handle being present. Does anyone else understand what I mean by that?

I love them both so much and I don't know who to choose?","I got a bf back home during junior year of high school.

I moved away for college and went to a different state. The first two years of college I've been with him long distance and I never looked at another boy.  His family is very close with mine and so every time I went home it was amazing to see him.

This year though, something has changed. I met a guy and after a few months of some rough horrible flirting and never happening to mention that I have a bf back home, he asked me out.

I said no because I ""didn't want to have relationships in college. I want to focus on my schoolwork"".

Nothing ever happened between him and me, besides unofficial coffee dates, studying together, and watching some movies together. The only reason i kept feeding into the idea that this was fine was because ""it's totally platonic"".

I don't know what to do. I feel absolutely horrible and disgusting. I never actually did anything with him but it feels like cheating because I have feelings for him.

The problem is that I am afraid that I am in love with this new guy more than my bf back home. And I love them both so much in different ways. I could see myself being with either one of them in a happy relationship.

And the guy at my school actually lives a town over from where I live back at home. It would literally be so easy to be with him when I go home and graduate.

I just don't know what to do. I don't want to be that girl who breaks up with an amazing guy just because I went to college, got bored of him, and wanted something ""new"". Help :(

Is it selling your own unique prints that no one else has? Selling viral MakerWorld stuff? Doing custom Hueforge art? Selling articulating dragons at the local flea market? How are people actually making money with their 3D printer,"So I have graduated from having a single P1S that I bought in June to now having a second P1S and an AD5X on the way (it will be here next week). I have 3 printers. I bought a second P1S so that it would help cut my print time down by 50% so I could knock out larger prints that I was doing for myself faster.

I bought the AD5X because I wanted to do multi-color printing and buying an AD5X was only .25 cents more than buying a Bambu AMS (first generation) for my P1S. Literally I got a whole 3D printer with AMS for .25 cents more than it would have cost me to buy a single first-gen AMS for my P1S. I didn't want a 3rd printer but I also could not ignore the crazy value in having an extra printer that comes with an AMS vs buying an AMS for my P1S for the same price.

But here I am now with 3 printers as someone who does not use 3D printing as a way to make money. I'm just a person who enjoyed 3D printing so much I wanted to do more of it and do it faster so I bought more printers. It's apparent to me now that I should think about monetizing my hobby to justify having 3 printers.

It seems like everyone has an Etsy store now where they sell stuff. Are people actually making money doing this as a side hustle when I feel like 3D printing as a small business is so over saturated. It's like when people would buy Cricut's and start trying to start small businesses with them like creating custom coffee mugs, bags or t-shirts. If anyone can buy one for a few hundred dollars and make stuff, how do you money with it?

It led me to think that the people making money doing this aren't selling fidget toys and articulating dragons they must be doing something unique that no one else can do like designing their own prints and selling those.

We were walking in the park together recently and I looked at him like,
‘Why do you look so GAY right now?’…
I couldn’t help asking …
‘You look one iced coffee away from doing a DRAMATIC… twirl’
I was a little scared because he looked so gay and he’s looked so gay before…

I mean… he was literally walking into Target few days apart.. and immediately getting overstimulated by the home decor aisle like the throw pillows like they were personally attacking him

AFTER I had just said a few days ago that only GIRLS care about decorating their home …

I was watching my friends dog one time. I texted my so called boyfriend saying I literally just touched the shower curtain and it broke. It’s ripped up…. How? What do I do?

Then shortly after I broke the vacuum after using it, just cleaning my mess 
I touched her sliding door curtain… it also broke. 
Felt like i was tripping. 
“Everything I touch.. breaks..”
Texted my boyfriend like… Now, I broke her sliding door curtain…
He asked me how…
I simply said..  “I touched it.”
He send a laughing emoji like this is all a joke 
This is the dumbest thing ever

I lived a sheltered life… 

Few months after my boyfriend realized that, he said he can help show me how to start a dishwasher…

I was like in my head… oh god I can’t look stupid 

Was almost like this literally was a real life adventure of a show called Dishwashing: A Journey of Growth and Self-Discovery…

As I’m thinking “how do you turn it on??”

First of all, like. . 
We came home one day. Parents house. My brother caused the dishwasher to leave a bunch of soap and water all over the kitchen. Water still moving further. Guess he doesn’t know either 

My boyfriend cleaned it up because I didn’t know how to 

He came over and starts explaining like he’s trying to give a TED talk. At this point, I’m convinced the dishwasher has more settings than my entire personality. 

I mean there’s more than one button…

He’s pressing buttons…
I’m watching like it’s a NASA launch sequence.
Finally, it turns on.
And I’m standing there thinking:

Looks like he has a magic wand. He’s really smart.. I own a small appliance that is more dramatic than me on a Sunday

I think our relationship might be a joke. It’s like, he’s trolling me???

Few days later, my dishwasher is exploiting soup. This is exactly what my brother did. 

On no 

“Fuck.. THIS!”
 
Put bleach in it. Make the dishes whiter. 

Now we turned our kitchen into a soup opera. Literally. 

Look up the definition of an idiot in the dictionary
Im like “a picture of me?”
“He’s just like.. no the definition of an idiot which you FUCKING.. are!!!”

He looks aggressively gay too often. 
He’s done so ..so many times , but unfortunately he did it so right. 

Too properly 
But I really needed to know if he was gay

I am NOT gay. For the record straight 

I had to get down.. to the questioning.

“How many dicks have you seen in your life”
“Where’s you’re gay gang”
“And… uh…one more thing do you have a pussy?” Or do you wish you did? Be honest with me 

Last question he was like.. I’m like need to ask one more more 

And look at the dude over there, do you think he’s hot? .. yes or no?

.  I have anxiety ..

Ok and one more thing I promise this is it… “what would you change your name to after you transition??”

“This has to be the most elaborate, “gay or not” test ever being evaluated “

For now I’ll keep hoping ..pretending he’s straight…  
 
But I beg you if you’re watching gay  porn .. TURN IT OFF 

I was really drunk one day. Looking at my BFF saying “I don’t like peanuts. I get an allergic reaction and I start choking.. gagging.. just… badly…reacting” 

Ok girl, then swipe right.. NO.. right?

I thought she said “I don’t like penises because it makes her choke and gag”

..well I love to choke and gag.

And also, she doesn’t even know what pegging means? (Laugh)

Oh man this show got so weird 

Real life sounds illegal. Is she ALSO just trying to pretend she’s not gay? She’s JUST SITTING THERE wearing a flannel shirt and just got a hair cut 

Can’t trust anyone anytime…

I Love you, .. friend. But.. this is basic adult curriculum..

I .. blacked out after that.. so still … uhhhh
After that we saw an old man at the window
I was scared and wanted to run out of the house. 

“Just thinking .It’s .. GETTING HECTIC 

Shortly after I don’t know where I am anymore…

We saw a big ass pig the size of a whale after that. Biggest whale in the world. I asked if she can confirm it’s there with me and she said yes ..what the fuck??.. HOW

I’m going to do a full on Olympian sprint out of this stupid  house 

Shortly after of nowhere my friend started singing. This is just., so.. WEIRD

“She’s so ..off key…”

But if you ever find yourself over in Hiroshima, there are a few great places I stopped by that are worth checking out as well!

[Cafe Latte](https://share.google/XHM72vMlA2yak7uDE) - gotta love the name. It’s a small shop right near by the Atomic Bomb Dome and the Peace Park. Most of the menu is espresso based drinks, but they also make a mean pour over (listed on the menu as “specialty coffee”). They likely rotate their beans regularly for the pour over, but when I went, it was so deliciously fruity. I normally never taste “berry” when it’s part of the flavor notes, but here? The berry flavor was in full force. One of the best cups that I’ve had in Japan.

[Cue.](https://share.google/QwLH5rmoKRkKiqtOw) - literally next door to the aforementioned Cafe Latte. This place has a more modern vibe, and a more modern style. But the coffee here is also no joke. They had more options for beans that you could choose from and a line of people out the door waiting to get in on the weekend. The coffee flavor was excellent, but it wasn’t as surprising to me as Cafe Latte was. Definitely worth checking out, though.

[Miles Coffee](https://share.google/7N7rDNOBkclf5zVf1) - very small shop! It disappears in the sea of buildings around it. It is right across the street from the hotel I stayed at (Hiroshima Hilton), but I never noticed it until late on my last evening in the city. I was in dire need for a caffeine boost and had been looking for a cafe for a while on my walk back to hotel, but wasn’t coming across any. I was about to give up and grab a cup from 7Eleven when my wife spotted the tiny COFFEE sign right above their doorway. And I’m super glad she did! It is tiny inside but it looks like they do their own roasting right in the shop. The baristas working were very kind, had English menus available, and there were many different beans to choose from. The shop is so full of “real coffee house vibes.” Can’t really explain what that means, but I’m sure plenty of people on this sub know the feeling. They know that they’re doing at this cafe. It was a delicious cup, and I don’t remember the flavor notes on the card they gave me, but I do remember how happy and uplifted I felt after finding this place and drinking the coffee here. If you’re staying at the Hiroshima Hilton, there is no excuse not to try this place out.

1p4avm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypersonaldevelopment/comments/1p4avm3/discover_joy_in_the_little_things/,Discover Joy in the Little Things,"Finding joy in the little things can often feel like a hidden treasure, waiting to be discovered in the everyday moments of life. In a fast-paced world where it’s easy to overlook the simple pleasures, taking time to appreciate the small wonders around us can light up our days and shift our perspectives.

https://preview.redd.it/sm91z8i31x2g1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ed6b77545a2417817fe2d6d9c547770c8d85594



The journey to discover joy starts with mindfulness. Being present is the key to recognizing the beauty that surrounds us. By tuning in to our senses, we become aware of the little things that often go unnoticed. Whether it’s the warmth of the sun on your skin, the sound of leaves rustling in the wind, or the delightful aroma of freshly brewed coffee, these moments can spark happiness. Simply taking a few deep breaths and grounding ourselves in the present moment allows us to connect with our environment and cultivate gratitude for the small joys.



Gratitude plays a vital role in this process. When we consciously acknowledge and appreciate what we have, we tap into a reservoir of positivity. Starting a gratitude journal can be an excellent practice. Each day, jot down a few things that brought you joy, no matter how small. This simple act helps rewire our brains to focus on the positive aspects of our lives, making it easier to find joy in the everyday.



Another wonderful approach is to embrace simplicity. In our pursuit of happiness, we often chase after big achievements or material possessions. However, true contentment often lies in the simplest pleasures. A leisurely walk in nature, listening to your favorite music, or enjoying a delicious meal can bring immense fulfillment. By lightening our expectations and allowing ourselves to savor these moments, we can create a more joyful existence.



Connection with others also enriches our experience of joy. Sharing moments, whether it’s a smile with a stranger or a heartfelt conversation with a friend, can create beautiful connections that elevate our spirits. These interactions often bring warmth and comfort, reminding us that we’re not alone in our journeys. Provide a compliment or offer help when you can; these small acts of kindness not only make others feel good but also increase our own feelings of joy.



Taking time for self-care and ensuring we nurture ourselves is equally essential. Engage in activities that make you happy, whether it’s reading a good book, indulging in a hobby, or even taking a moment to enjoy a warm bath. Prioritizing self-care allows us to recharge and create a deeper connection with ourselves, making it easier to find joy in the little things.



Nature is an incredible source of joy. Spend time outdoors and immerse yourself in the beauty of the world around you. Notice the colors, the sounds, and the textures of nature. From a blooming flower to a starry night, nature has its way of evoking feelings of wonder and joy. Consider setting aside moments each week to explore local parks or simply sit in your backyard, allowing yourself to connect with the earth.



Learning to let go can also be a transformative step in discovering joy. Often, we hold onto grudges, worries, or negative thoughts that weigh us down. Letting go of these burdens can lighten our hearts and allow space for joy to enter. Focus on the present and embrace what you cannot change. This shift in mindset opens the door to appreciating the beauty that lies in each moment.



Creating rituals can enhance our ability to find joy in the little things. Establishing daily routines or rituals that bring you happiness can transform ordinary moments into extraordinary experiences. Whether it’s your morning coffee ritual, a weekly movie night, or an evening walk, these moments create anticipation and become opportunities to savor life’s simple pleasures.



Lastly, it’s important to remember that joy is not a constant state; it ebbs and flows. Accepting the ups and downs of life helps us appreciate the joyful moments even more. Rather than striving for perfection, allow yourself to feel a range of emotions. Embrace the journey, knowing that every step—no matter how small—can lead to moments of joy.



By shifting our focus from the grand to the small, we can uncover the abundance of joy hidden in everyday life. Embrace the little things, cultivate gratitude, and invite joy into your heart. The magic lies in recognizing that happiness is often present in the gentlest moments, waiting for you to discover it. Each day is an opportunity to find joy, so keep your heart open and relish the simple beauty that surrounds you.",1,1763863973.0,mypersonaldevelopment,0,1.0,False

I also wanted to mention the types of movies that don't scare me.

Movie themes that don't do much for me (more often than not are your typical ghost stories. I hated the Conjuring, Insidious, Annabelle, and The Nun because I'm just not really a believer in Ghosts/Spirits. Which leads me to my next theme of possession or the devil, don't believe so never scared and usually bored. With that said, there are obviously some really great exceptions to that which I've included a few below but for the most part I don't typically care for it unless it's done in a very elevated way or something that hasn't been done before.

An idea of what creeps me out is really well done Alien stuff, Nightmares, Serial Killers, and I do like fantasy/supernatural stuff like Vampires and Werewolves if done ""right"". I love movies that twist or leave you mind f'd (I've seen Martyrs and The Coffee Table loved both, didn't like Bring Her Back as much as everyone else seemingly did). TYIA for any suggestions <3

Movies I love:

\-Alien

\- American Psycho

\-Barbarian

\-At The Devils Door (even though this goes against my typical preference)

With the victory of the Constitutionalists allowing the return of Democracy to Nicaragua, the Mexican government engaged in deep talks with the Constitutionalist Government regarding economic aid to stabilize the nation after the brutality of the Civil War. The new Nicaraguan government having many similarities to the Liberal movement of the Mexican government that arose in the 1920s aided the camaraderie during the talks and allowed for negotiations to proceed smoothly for both nations. In the end, the Nicaraguan government agreed to allow Mexico to modernize its economy.

Mexico has thus invested $25,000,000 in the Nicaraguan textiles industry, coffee industry, and their light industries, providing the necessary equipment, but also experts and advisers from its own industries to overhaul the Nicaraguan methods of production in turn for Mexican companies taking shares in Nicaraguan business and success.

Additionally, a small security attaché was agreed upon to help advise the Nicaraguan security forces and train them further to help ensure that the state's security and defense forces were bolstered.

I saw a cute guy (25M) at a coffee place and got the courage to ask for his number. I was very surprised when he actually ended up giving it to me. Things ended up going very well and he asked me out on a date. Fast forward, we have now been on three dates. He is very sweet, extremely smart, well-accomplished, handsome, etc... He pays/ plans all the dates and wants hangout even more. He's perfect on paper. Well... except one thing is missing.... his sense of humor.

I try to crack jokes but I get nothing back in return. I have been told I'm a pretty goofy individual. He on the other hand is quite serious and our conversations tend to be quite dry and analytical. I'll say certain things to get a reaction from him, but he just says something like, ""Oh that's pretty cool"" and then moves on with the conversation. Today, I tried to lighten the conversation by telling him some humorous/ embarrassing stories of mine and then asking if he has any. 

He just said something along the lines of, ""That's nothing to be ashamed of"" and did not really laugh. As for his own embarrassing stories, he had none to share. I even asked for some fun memories of his while growing up and he seems to have had a very strict upbringing. Most of his memories just had to do with accomplishment after accomplishment. I feel really bad, but I find myself getting bored with the conversations sometimes and my mind starts to drift. Perhaps I'm just too dumb for him? 

I don't know what to do. He's a great guy and I feel like a fool to just let him go, but I just don't have as great of a time with him as I do with my friends. I feel bad because I was the one who asked him out, only to now be thinking of possibly rejecting him. I'm confused on whether or not I should continue to give him a chance or let our lack of chemistry be the end of it all.

Two men got into a fight that led to a deadly stabbing when the victim punched and kicked the suspect after he ignored the victim's handshake. It also appears that the victim harassed the suspect initially, who was just drinking coffee. The suspect stabbed the victim and ran away. The victim succumbed after a few hours.

To me, what you reap is what you sow.  
  
Also, IMO, carrying deadly sharp weapons is prohibited in public and a violation of the law, unless you are a vendor (butcher or something) or worker who is permitted to use sharp weapons in an appropriate place.

In some places, carrying weapons for self-defense has become almost normal due to their environment, but this should change. Most of the people on Facebook see the stabbing as simply the right thing to do, but I sense something is terribly wrong with this, since, in general, it could backfire, and it's alarming to normalize carrying deadly weapons as a tool for self-defense, since they can be misused in many harmful ways, especially when young people are involved as they might find it ""cool"".

I just finished my first 6 days of travel in Japan (3.5 days in Tokyo & 2.5 days in Kyoto) and I had such an amazing experience that I legit made a Reddit just to post tips and my experience and open a forum for others to also add on to what I'm missing or suggest otherwise. I also want to be able to come back to this and share this with anyone I meet thinking Japan in the near future.

I saw most major tourist attractions between the two cities (this does require a lot of walking & eagerness - this won't suit everyone for 6 days the same way it did for me).

Transportation

Tokyo - it is very easy to get to Shinjuku, Shibuya, Asakusa, Akihabara from the airport by subway. When you arrive type in the destination you are staying on google maps and select the subway icon for which rail lines to take. If the lines show different colors, you will be transferring at a connecting station. If you don't go the IC card pass route buying tickets with Yen or Card is very easy (but the IC card would limit the amount of time spent purchasing tickets albeit it only takes 20 seconds). Each rail line in any station in the cities will have kiosks in front of the enter gates and they do have an English option available. When transferring lines you need to purchase a multi ticket, if not when you get to the transfer gate and enter your ticket in the gate it will not let you through, and you will then have to talk to the officer to pay a transfer fee (people walk fast through the gates scanning). Or you can buy connecting tickets at both the first line and the transfer line. They will have multiple ticket costs, google maps will show the route cost if you follow it at the top and bottom. To get around Tokyo it is very easy to get around the entire city to major attractions by subway (if you are okay with walking a good amount). Most of the newer subways in Tokyo will have a small screen showing stops making it easy to follow and also announce them in both English and Japanese.

Shinkansen - the Shinkansen from Tokyo station was very easy. Just be sure to follow the Shinkansen signs because there are local JR lines there that can get confusing. It is much easier to book on JR online and add the QR to your phone wallet ahead of time then finding the booth and getting tickets there just related to waiting lines in the major stations.

Kyoto - Kyoto has a subway route as well. I stayed near Kyoto Station and was able to take the Nara line directly to Fushimi Inari. But if you are staying in that area you would need to take a subway route and then transfer by bus to get to some of the other major temple locations like Kinkaku-ji and Kiyomizu-dera and this is time consuming (roughly 50 minutes to an hour) from Kyoto Station. It was very quick and easy to travel to these locations by Uber. The Ubers are Uber taxi and the drivers I had were all very respectful and often messaged and waited to find me in busy areas. Price wise just like uber in the US, if you call for it in a non populated spot (like right by a temple) price will be lower due to surcharges just like anywhere else. I was getting Uber's $10-15 cheaper a couple blocks down.

Tourist Attractions

Tokyo

Shinjuku - The views at night are lively. If you want to hit all of the main tourist spots it's walkable. A good start is beginning from the Godzilla head (can actually google Godzilla head and this is the Kabukicho district) and from there you can walk to Golden Gai after exploring the city center and grabbing a bite. During the day Gyeon Park is worth it, I know it's just a park, but it's a great morning thing to do, there are great views and picture spots and it's easy to get to and from by subway. I went late November and the views were amazing. Also there are good coffee shops in that area. Golden Gai certainly is filled with tourists, but I had good experiences (I know some didn't) picking bars that did not advertise cover charges and looked to not have as many tourists. The first bar I went in had all locals, but I know timing,etc. might be different, but it is worth seeing/experiencing nonetheless. Side note: if you are a male traveler there are promoters standing outside of golden gai that will try to get you to come to their clubs, I know it's obvious but don't fall for this scam. There are however better pockets and places to grab a drink in Shibuya.

Shibuya - Hachiko statue will be walkable to right out of the station. It doesn't matter what time of day it is, the crossing is always busy. While not socially acceptable, people do record and take pictures during the crosswalk walk. There are so many people that do it, so if you wanted to, you'd just blend in to be honest (I wouldn't for the record). There is a Starbucks there that can give you a view of the crossing from a viewpoint. A good starting point is Hachiko statue, do the cross and then watch the crossing at Starbucks. From there you have plenty of options depending on what you're into. What worked for me was walking over to the Meiji Shrine (somewhat of a walk) and coming back through harajuku and then to Myashita Park (shopping area) then walking back over to the crossing to then check out the biggest Don Quijote. (One thing to note for shopping is carry your passport - tourists get tax free for purchases over 5,000 Yen and these stores advertise that. This equates to about 10%, so pretty substantial with large purchases. Some stores like Bic Camera in Akihabara offer additional discounts. I bought a Seiko watch local to the Japanese market (they will have these labeled) and they offered that tax free amount plus a 5% incentive discount for using a Visa card. If you want to check out the Pokémon center and Nintendo store, they are also located in a multi floor mall that is walkable to. Book an advanced ticket to check out Shibuya Sky at night, you won't regret it.

Akihabara -

Super potato for old school games is often mentioned - it was alright for a quick stop and starting point to then head to Radio Kaikan and walk along the Main Street. If you are into Pokémon, they'll have plenty of card shops scattered throughout - I do hear however, there are better more prevalent options in Osaka than in Akihabara. I just enjoyed shop hopping in Akihabara but I think unless you're super into Anime, Pokemon etc. and want to do the maid/theme cafes this is maybe a half day thing. Also check out Yodobashi and Bic Camera for big deals.

Asakusa -

Start at Nakamise Shopping Street and walk through to Senso Ji. I went mid day and kind of regret that because my goodness...it was packed. This was also mid week so I can't imagine a weekend. It's worth making the walk up the street to try some quick Japanese bites and look and some souvenirs before walking up to the temple. Might be better suited to go when everything first opens. From Senso, make the walk to the Sky Tree. You'll see the river on the way and can stop somewhere for a coffee or a quick bite. The Sky Tree is honestly worth it (it's not just another tall building). I didn't have a reservation (just bought a ticket on the spot at the kiosk (they run on the half hour). There are so many food spots and shops within the Sky Tree to explore before and after. They even had a Holiday pop up market outside. They have a blazing fast elevator to get to the top and have a few restaurants and cafes at the top. You'll have the option to pay to go to the level before the top and extra for the very top. I went to the very top and would recommend. They'll let you take a ""free picture"" at the very top portion professionally but then ask you to pay for full size, but you can decline and they'll still give you small size for free.

Kyoto

I compiled advice from other redditors in terms of temple timing and it paid dividends. For the temples that charge keep in mind that most are cash only. For Fushimi Inari it is a great night hike (if you are physically able), get there around 4:30 PM - there will be plenty of tourists there in the front (don't worry) they will be hovered around the smaller Tongi Gates to take photos thinking they won't have a chance later on. If you can take the full hike (for the record challenging) it is so worth it. About half way through most tourists will turn around and there are lights throughout and plenty of empty spots to take photos. When you get closer to the final temple spot at the top, if you begin your hike with that timing you will see sunset views mixed with city line and Tongi Gates, truly breathtaking..There are spots to take breaks on the hike and vending machines for drinks throughout. For Kiyomizudera do the opposite (I went on a Friday and this still worked) and go before it opens at 6am. There will be other people waiting but this will allow you to secure a spot for sunrise and take in the view. I hear it's packed at other times of the day regardless, including sunset. From there you can walk through Sannen Zaka and Ninen Zaka Path and this is perfect timing because shops are closed and you get to see it all and capture pictures before it gets crazy with tourists. There is a small coffee stand that is open, or if you can wait it out there is a Starbucks that opens at 8am that you can wait in line for to see. It is a Kyoto themed Starbucks and you can sit on a pillow with shoes off Kyoto style while enjoying your coffee before continuing (easily coolest Starbucks I've been to) From there you can visit Kodaiji Temple when it opens, then visit Yasaka-Jinja Shrine, then take a break at Maruyama park and visit Chion In Temple. At night you could explore Gion and have dinner there. It is very worth it to go off the beaten path to see the ""real Gion"". Just type in Leica Boutique on your maps and walk those neighborhoods at tonight, that's the real Kyoto feel. Another day visit Ginkakuji and from there walk the ""Path of Philosohy"", there will be signs for other smaller temples to visit on that route to Nanzenji Temple (it closes at 4:30 PM but one can still walk around the grounds even after it's closed). Scatter in a visit to Kinkakuji (Golden Pavillion) & Nishiki Market. Nishiki Market is a great evening plan. There are so many market foot choices and stores/restaurants in that area to explore. They have certain happy hour deals as well for food and drink combos. If you want to eat at a Izakaya and explore some of the Kyoto nightlife (while not very prevalent) you can walk to Kiyamachi-Dori street another cool spot from there as well. You seriously can't go wrong with food in Kyoto. If there is a line odds are there is a Izakaya just as good down the road hidden, just explore and you'll find gems. I found some incredible sit on the floor izakaya's and cafes just exploring back streets off the main path.

And one thing to note is there are great places to eat in both Tokyo and Kyoto station if you are waiting or nearby as well as very good cafeterias in big department stores (often lower level).

I have not written this much with such ease in over a week. I wrote 812 words for I'm Still Sisyphus today. I did not take any time to paint or sculpt, I was just focusing on my story. Most of what I wrote wasn't even a part of my outline, just the flow of the story and the characters taking over, and yet it came to me like shards to a magnet.

It was lovely, unexpectedly so since I kept myself up a little later than I should have last night. No particular reason, I just lost track of time and suddenly it was almost 3 a.m. I had a very difficult time getting myself out of bed. Peach was a help though; she was back to stealing my spot this morning. I had a bit of a groggy morning but thank goodness, once it was midday I was as awake as I'd usually be. The tiredness is only starting to catch up to me a little now.

I don't have much else to tell you. The birds are enjoying the feeders finally. A lot of chickadees and juncos. I also put some water out for them this morning. The feeders are nearly empty now but the ground is covered in all the seed them spilled so I'm going to wait a day or two before I refill; let them clean up after themselves a little first. Mother is selling some product that Father brought home from work on Facebook marketplace so I have been helping her take pictures and make posts. It is all christmas ornaments and we have sold a decent amount. If she is willing to sell little things like that, maybe I can finally convince her to have a garage sale next spring or summer. We'll see.

Well, I'm going to relax for the night now. Make some coffee and hope that banishes the sand from my eyes a little. I'll try to get to bed at a reasonable time tonight.

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet.

You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

Me and my girlfriend (we’re both in our mid-30s, from Brazil) are coming to Boston for the first time and staying for 6 days. Just found a pretty good deal at the Arcadian Hotel in Brookline and we’re thinking about using it as our home base.
We usually stay in neighborhoods that feel a bit more local and laid-back (for example, Soho or Greenwich Village in NYC, Westwood in LA) instead of the big tourist zones. We love walking everywhere, eating good food, catching a sports game, and exploring the city at our own pace—really just pretending we’re locals, you know?


•	Anyone here know Brookline and/or the Arcadian? Would you recommend it as a base for exploring Boston?


•	Is it easy to get around without a car? What’s the public transport like? Can we reach Fenway, downtown, main sights, etc.?


•	Any favorite restaurants, bars, coffee shops we should check out nearby?


•	How safe and active is this neighborhood, especially at night for a couple?


•	Anything else we should know before booking—pros, cons, big tips?

I am not looking for a short term thing.. fyi. 

I am a 57 year old man from California who is looking for someone, a unique someone, a woman, who is smart and kind and with a touch of humor and sarcasm, fun to spend time with and true to herself and those around her. Introvert like me is cool but not a deal breaker, She enjoys a night in on the couch and a movie, cares about her health and cares for those around her enjoys humor, kitchen dancing and just enjoying the downtime together, after a long working day, we come home to the person that is our home and just enjoy those moments together. Yeah I might be a bit of a sap too, in case you missed that ;-) 

Interests on my end are varied yet simple, I enjoy travel, mostly roadtrips, cooking and photography, writing and music, films, reading and coffee, can be found on a nice day off at the beach with my feet in the sand and just enjoying the waves. I am 420 friendly but edibles only as I don’t smoke and rarely drink, aside from the occasional single malt. I am a jeans and t-shirt guy, with a casual, laid back style who enjoys a good day at a street fair or just roaming thrift stores or a great garage sale (I always follow those homemade signs and have to pull over to check it out).. Bonus points for sense of humor and especially fans of puns and Dad jokes, transparency is a big thing with me. 

Oh and as far as music goes.. Music with me is scattered and eclectic, I like classic rock, alternative, jazz, R&B, pop, you name it, I can go from AC/DC to Rush, The Who, Stones to Joy Division/New Order, to Miles Davis and Yellowjackets, to Beethoven and Mozart to Sanborn, Zevon, DCFC/Postal, Clean Bandit, Jess Glynn, Gran Bel Fisher, Rafferty, Genesis, Shins, Cake, Killers, Coldplay, Winwood, Segar, Madness, Dead Milkmen, violent fems, to sputnik to zeppelin to prince to floyd all in the course of a few hours and I could probably go on but I think you get the idea lol.. Its harder for films as I have way too many favorite movies and TV is scattered too but as a short example list, Firefly, Eureka, Anything Sorkin, good drama, or comedy.. not much of a horror fan but enjoy a good mystery with a horror angle.. Again, a long list :-)

Singing in the car is a must (yeah I am that whackadoodle you saw at the traffic light doing the car karaoke 🤣) and carrying a tune is not mandatory but would be cool if one of us in the car could carry one 😜 what is mandatory is my taking your hand and spontaneous dancing in the kitchen or elsewhere. That is a guarantee 💃🕺

At the end of the day, to quote Page & Plant, “Gotta find the Queen of all my dreams”. 

Someone to connect with and continue to grow with, let’s chat and see how we vibe and take things from there, naturally and organically and see what develops. 

Location is not a factor but must be USA/Canada based NO exceptions, age is not a factor, It’s all about who you are as a person, and how we mesh together that matters most to me. So your age doesn’t matter, But, I do tend to connect better with those younger than me.. 

Your reply should tell me about you with age and location and your interests, Those with a picture attached gets mine in reply, and physical attraction is important, and I prefer to get this part over with early on. 

Apologies if I am too blunt or transparent but it’s the way I am, I don’t do games, I don’t ghost, I am a straight shooter and like that about myself.

1p4aejb,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1p4aejb/jura_z6_pep_only_dispenses_every_second_coffee/,"Jura Z6 PEP, only dispenses every second coffee","I bought a refurbished Jura Z6 PEP almost 14 months ago and I've been using it ever since.  
It's a pretty decent copy of the old Saeco system - not as good as the original, like most copies, with some serious flaws IRT maintenance.

Be that as it may, the machine produced OK espresso for about a year. OK in that is' underextracted and the grind is too coarse, but it seems to be inevitable with modern superautomatics (my Saeco Magic from 1995 doesn't have the issue, curiously enough... yes, it's still happily making coffee in Europe, 30 years later...)  


In any case: the machine started doing something even weirder: even set at medium grind, it will correctly grind the coffee for whatever coffee preparation you choose, then flash the 'fill the beans in the container' error on the screen, not dispense and dump the (dry) grounds into the discard tray.  
If at that point you select any coffee , this second pull will behave normally.  
However - and this is the really weird part - if you then select any coffee again, it will fail the third one. And be successful for the fourth one. And so on.

This makes little sense to me, but I took the whole thing apart and cleaned it. I even pulled the brew group and washed that - something that the machine should make MUCH easier, see my comments on the Saeco above, given that it should be done at least once a month.

The machine is cleaner, but it gives the same error every other coffee. And I have no idea how to get it to work properly.  
The grinder was completely emptied and cleaned twice, so was the 'chute'... but it's as if on the first grind the machine doesn't detect grounds and gives that weird error, despite the fact that the grinder operates normally (as is also evidenced by the fact that the grounds are spit out - dry, as mentioned - after the failed cycle.

Any suggestions or procedures I'm missing?

We came to Mexico for our honeymoon for the very first time, and the trip was absolutely amazing. A lot of inspiration and practical tips came from Reddit, so we wanted to give back and share our full experience to help others planning a similar trip. We are the type of people who like to do things on vacation, explore, eat, move, and experience as much as possible.

⸻

Accommodation

Book an Airbnb instead of an overpriced resort. It is three to four times cheaper, gives you much more freedom, and you will enjoy your stay a lot more. Resort food and all-inclusive deals sound convenient, but they limit you and quickly get repetitive.

We stayed at Miranda Condos, which had a rooftop pool and gym, 24/7 front desk and security, and was right by the beach and close to 5th Avenue. It is a calm area with great restaurants and cafés nearby. Highly recommend it.

⸻

Practical Tips

Car: Get one. Public transport works fine, but if you want to see more and stay flexible, having a car makes all the difference. We rented from EasyWay in Playa del Carmen. Communication was smooth, prices were fair (around 30 USD per day), and they communicate through WhatsApp. Gas is cheap and everything went without a problem.

Cash: You can pay with a card in most places, but it is easier and usually cheaper to pay in pesos.

ATMs: Use machines located inside bank branches. We used Banorte (62 peso withdrawal fee) and Scotiabank is also a good option.

Repellent: You will need it. There are lots of mosquitoes both during the day and at night. Buy local spray and reapply often.

Toilets: Do not throw paper into the toilet. The pipes are narrow and it will clog easily. Save yourself the awkward moments.

Safety: We felt completely safe everywhere. You will get offered weed and cocaine a lot, just ignore it and move on.

Coconut electrolyte water: Sold in OXXO stores, perfect after runs or hot days out.

⸻

Breakfast

Ojo de Agua – We went four times because it was that good. It is a perfect mix of Mexican and modern cuisine with lots of healthy and post-workout options. The peanut butter açaí bowl was incredible, same for the salmon and tuna sandwiches. Avocado truffa and cochinita toast were our favorites. The waffles, motuleño eggs with chorizo, and juices were all top notch, and the coffee was excellent.

Que Huevos – A nice, cozy place with good juices, though not as many options as Ojo de Agua. The breakfast burrito was great.

Arcana – Our post-run stop every morning. They serve elixirs (like immunity shots, the “Wake Up Call” is the best), açaí bowls, overnight oats, and good coffee. Everything is organic and the whole place feels like you are in the jungle.

La Cueva del Chango – Beautiful Mexican spot surrounded by trees and plants. When you sit down, they offer you chocolate and vanilla buns, and you should take them. The juices and sauces were great, and the motuleño eggs and chilaquiles with avocado and fried eggs were delicious.

⸻

Lunch and Dinner

El Fogón – Simply amazing. Michelin star in 2024 and 2025, and totally deserved. The mango margarita was incredible, and everything we tried such as guacamole, tacos, tortas, gringas, melted cheese, alambres, and pico de gallo was top quality. We went three times, and every visit was perfect. The atmosphere is lively, prices are great, and the staff works incredibly hard. Tip them well. Do not miss the torta al pastor con queso.

No name food truck (between Taquería El Jarocho and a burger truck) – One of the best local experiences we had. We went four times and tried everything on the menu. It is a small family business with the old lady as the boss and her kids cooking and serving. Locals line up every night. There is a self-serve table with pickled red onions, cucumbers, radishes, and spicy sauces. You sit on plastic chairs, eat with your hands, and it is absolutely fantastic. Super cheap and incredibly tasty. Order the jamaica drink.

Birria de la 30 – The owner came out and served us himself, recommending the classic tacos and broth. Delicious. Try the taco dorado con queso and agua de sabor. Ask for extra cilantro and dip your tacos into the broth.

La Perla Pixan Cuisine and La Carbonería – Great drinks, good juices, and excellent octopus and fish tacos. Modern Mexican food, friendly staff, live band, and TVs to watch sports.

La Negra Tomasa (Tulum) – Seafood only, and one of the best meals of our trip. The aguachile sauce was on another level and I literally drank it. The salmon tostadas were incredibly fresh, the tacos pulpo and tacos gober were amazing, and you should definitely try the Piñada.

Taquería La Bendición de Dios (Valladolid) – Located in someone’s backyard. They offered us a taste of everything and it was all delicious and cheap. Try the tortas and pibihuas.

⸻

Activities

Running: Every morning we ran 5K along 5th Avenue. There are plenty of runners and great energy early in the morning. Go around 7 am before it gets too hot. Coconut electrolytes from OXXO afterwards are perfect.

Chichén Itzá: Definitely worth visiting, even though it is a long drive. It is one hour behind Playa del Carmen time. Get there around 8 or 9 am before the big buses arrive. Roads are good, but bring cash for tolls. On the way back we stopped in Valladolid and ate at local homes. People were kind and welcoming, and the food was incredible.

Cenotes: We visited Cenote Azul, Dos Ojos (both near Tulum), and Suytum in Yucatán. All were beautiful and worth visiting. Bring snorkel gear if you have it.

Cozumel: Take the Xcaret Ferry, which runs every hour. Buy tickets online. We booked a snorkeling tour with Mario El Cielo (Abrimar) and it was one of the highlights of the trip. We visited three snorkeling spots, there were about 14 people on the boat, and they provided the gear. They served ceviche with nachos, fruit with tajín and salt, beers, and tequila shots poured straight into our mouths. The atmosphere was amazing, music playing, everyone having fun. We saw sharks, starfish, rays, and lots of colorful fish.

Beach Clubs: We went to Tantra Tulum. Prices were reasonable and the food and drinks were great. The basic entrance was 4000 pesos for two people, which includes sunbeds and an umbrella, and you get half of that back as credit for food and drinks. Make a reservation at least a day in advance; they have an online map where you can pick your spot. The beach was clean and beautiful, the staff was super nice, and parking was easy (200 pesos for the day). Next door is Taboo Beach Club, which also looked great.

Day Pass: There is an app called Resort Pass where you can book day access to hotels and use their facilities. Since it was our honeymoon, we wanted to try a luxury resort experience for a day, so we booked Iberostar Selection Coral in Cancún. It was 180 USD per person and had great reviews online, but in reality, it was a disappointment. The beach and pool were nice, but the food and drinks were bland, the alcohol was cheap, and even the guacamole was bad. We laughed about it the whole day and decided it is a memory we will keep forever. Lesson learned: skip the resort day pass. Go to a beach club or eat local street food instead.

I just want to know if this sounds like something a person’s brain can go through and still work afterward.

I already did the boring rational checklist.
Gas leak. Mold. Not enough sleep. Too much stress. Memory screw-ups. I actually wrote them all out in a notes app and tried to make each one fit.

None of them explain what I remember. None of them explain what’s missing now.

I remember what I saw. I remember what I heard. And I remember a person who was right next to me for hours.

You can say I’m misreading it. Fine.

Just don’t tell me it was all in my head.

It started with a screenshot.

My friend Liam dropped it in our group chat around two in the morning. It was low-res, all blocky pixels. Concrete hallway. Green paint on the walls. Doors down both sides. The doors didn’t have handles. Above each one, there was a black number stenciled onto the wall.

Under the screenshot, someone had written:

“South annex, Building D. Stairs go down three more floors than the blueprints say. Do NOT go past the second landing. You’ll know why.”

The username in the screenshot was blurred out. The image came from some dead urbex forum. When I tried to find the original thread, every link I clicked led to a broken archive page or a scraped copy missing half the posts. I never found where that caption was first posted.

This is exactly Liam’s thing.

He spends weekends in abandoned hospitals and parking structures and service tunnels. If a place is empty, off-limits, and smells old, he wants to walk around in it. I’m usually the one warning him about trespassing and rotten floors and security cameras.

That night, I didn’t say no.

I told myself it was because the place was close. About a forty-five minute drive from town, just off the highway, near an industrial park that never filled properly. Most of the buildings out there turned into storage or stayed “For Lease” until the banners faded.

Liam did his usual digging beforehand.

“Used to be a research lab,” he said in the car. He was in the passenger seat scrolling, I was driving. “Spin-off from a defense contractor. Closed sometime in the eighties. Official paperwork says ‘materials testing.’ Old posts say ‘human factors.’ Sleep trials, sensory stuff, that kind of thing.”

I kept my attention on the road. “Old posts where?”

“Forum nobody moderates anymore,” he said. “Half the threads are bots. Screenshots look like they were taken on a potato. That’s how you know it’s good.”

He sounded relaxed. Too relaxed, honestly.

The sky was just a flat gray slab that day. When we pulled into the industrial park, the whole place felt wrong in a way I didn’t have a neat word for. Big rectangles of concrete and brick, too many parking spaces, not enough people or vehicles. It looked like the tail end of a half-built future.

Building D didn’t have a nameplate.

Just a two-story brick block with dark windows and a sagging chain-link fence around the front. A rusted padlock hung on the gate. The link right next to it had been cut, and somebody had looped the loose chain back through the lock so it looked sealed at a glance.

Liam saw that and smiled. When he looked over and saw my face, the smile faded a little.

“We can still bail,” he said. “Walk the outside, peek in, get food. No big deal.”

“Let’s at least see the first floor,” I heard myself say.

That answer didn’t match how I actually felt.

Inside, the air felt dead. No draft, no movement. Dust lay on every surface. The lobby looked like generic late-70s office space: square tan tiles, glass doors in metal frames, a long front desk with an old CRT monitor sitting dark on top.

There was a black spray-painted smiley face on one wall. Nothing else. No tags.

We went through a door behind the front desk and stepped into a corridor. Most of the rooms off it had been stripped. Ceiling grids open, tiles missing, wires hanging down. The carpet was stained in big irregular patches. A couple of those stains still had darker edges that looked too fresh for a place that had been empty for decades.

“Do you smell that?” Liam asked.

Under the dust, there was a sharp metallic scent and something chemical that didn’t match mildew or old building smell.

“This is probably where they did the tests,” he said, leaning into a room that had a one-way mirror built into the far wall. “Observers on one side, subjects on the other.”

“Great,” I said. “So, south annex?”

He checked his phone again. “If the blueprint I found is right, the annex should be that way.” He pointed deeper into the building.

We kept going.

Some of the doors had room numbers stenciled above the frame. 112. 114. 116. Then a jump to 120. Then 126. Then one door with no number at all. The next one after that had 118, which didn’t line up with the sequence at all.

I decided they must’ve remodeled the floor at some point and changed the layout without updating everything.

At the end of the corridor was a plain metal door with an EXIT sign above it. The plastic on the sign was faded. The light inside it was off.

Liam pushed the door open.

The hallway from the screenshot was on the other side.

Concrete floor with a narrow strip of worn material down the center. Green painted walls. Doors on both sides spaced exactly the same distance apart. Above each door, a black number.

All of them were 0.

First door: 0.

Second door: 0.

Third door: 0.

Our footsteps landed on the floor and stopped. No echo.

“This is it,” I said.

Liam stepped up close to one of the zeros. “They painted over the real numbers,” he said. “Look close.”

He was right. Up close, you could see faint outlines under the zeros. Shapes like 101, 103, 105, just a little off-center. The new black 0s sat on top of them.

At the far end of the hallway, another EXIT sign glowed red.

“There’s no power in this building,” I said. “We didn’t see any other lights on.”

“Emergency line,” he said. “Separate wiring. Or some old battery that should’ve been dead years ago and isn’t.”

His voice didn’t carry the way it should have. It seemed to just stop a few feet away.

Halfway down the hall, I noticed I was breathing harder. The air felt heavier in my chest. Not warmer. Just dense.

We stopped at one of the doors with a 0 above it.

No handle, no lock, no hinges on our side. Just a door with a narrow vertical slot at eye level.

Liam bent forward to look through the slot.

“Don’t,” I said.

He stayed there. “It’s just black,” he said. “Can’t see anything.”

He turned on his phone flashlight and angled the beam at the slot.

The light hit the opening and didn’t go anywhere beyond it. No reflection, no faint surface, nothing. Just the beam cutting off.

Liam’s face tightened. “Yeah, that’s not how this should work,” he muttered.

A sound came from further down the hall.

Something dragging. Dry. Slow.

We both froze.

“Probably a raccoon,” he said. It didn’t sound like he believed it.

The sound came again.

Same volume, same distance. There was no echo, no way to tell direction. The hallway might as well have absorbed it in place.

“Let’s just find the stairs,” I said. “We see them, then we leave. That’s it.”

He hesitated, then nodded once. “Okay. Stairs, then gone.”

We moved on.

The EXIT sign at the end of the hallway didn’t seem to get closer. My body said we were walking. My eyes said we were staying in the same spot. I checked my watch. We walked for about a minute and the sign looked exactly the same.

“Wait,” I said. “This—”

The EXIT sign flicked off.

When it came back on, it was right above the door in front of us.

We hadn’t crossed that distance.

Liam let out a short, shaky laugh. “All right,” he said. “That’s… something. Old construction messing with perspective.”

That dragging noise came again. One drawn-out pull and then a single, clear tap on the floor.

“I’m done,” I said. “Stairs, then out. I mean it this time.”

He opened the door.

The stairwell looked ordinary at first glance.

Square landings, concrete steps, metal railings. Black stenciled numbers on the walls at each landing.

The level we were on had a 1.

One flight down was marked 0.

Another flight down was marked -1.

The first -1 we saw had a line scratched through it, like someone had dug a key or a nail across it.

There were no stairs going higher than 1. No roof door.

“You read the caption,” Liam said. “Stairs go lower than they should. Don’t go past the second landing. That’s the warning.”

He put his hand on the rail.

“Second landing and we’re out,” he said. “For real. I just want to see how far it goes.”

“You always say that,” I said.

“Yeah, and sometimes I mean it,” he said.

We started down.

The air grew colder with each flight. By the time we reached the landing with 0, my fingers were numb on the rail. There was a door there. Metal, blank, no window.

“Leave it alone,” I said.

He did, which surprised me.

“One more,” he said. “We hit -1, confirm the pattern, then we’re done.”

The next landing down had -1 on the wall again. This stencil didn’t have a scratch through it. The door here had a black 0 above it, just like the hallway doors.

“We saw it,” I said. “That’s the second landing. Your little rule is met. Time to go back up.”

The stairwell lights shut off.

It wasn’t dramatic. No popping glass. Just a tiny electrical noise and then only our flashlights.

His phone beam and my headlamp made two small islands of light. Beyond those, nothing.

“Tell me that was a timer,” I said. “Please say there’s some stupid motion sensor.”

“That wasn’t me,” he said, and I believed him.

Something moved below us.

Not footsteps. Not any animal noise I recognized. It was a slow, steady shift, like a heavy coil of something being rearranged.

Liam aimed his light downward.

We didn’t see the familiar pattern of stairs fading into a darker distance. The light hit a gray space that refused to show depth or shape.

My eyes started to sting again.

“We’re going now,” I said. “Up.”

He nodded.

We climbed.

We went up one full flight.

The landing number said -1.

He stopped.

“No,” he said. “That’s not right.”

“We started at 1,” I said. “Then 0. Then -1. We came down to this one. We just went up one. This should be 0. It’s not.”

As we looked at it, the number changed.

The paint didn’t smear. The wall didn’t shift. It was the same marks. My brain just suddenly read them as -1 again instead of 0. No transition. Just a new fact.

Liam’s breathing went uneven. “We misread it before,” he said quickly. “It’s fine. We’re just panicking. That’s all.”

He climbed three more steps.

There was no landing up there.

The stairs continued in the same downward direction in front of him. When he turned and looked behind, those also went down. The landing we thought we were leaving didn’t exist on either side.

He stared at me.

“Stop moving,” I said. “Stay right where you are.”

We stood in that same section of stairwell for several seconds.

A new sound started.

Short, hard taps. Not random. In groups. Tap tap tap. Pause. Tap. Longer pause. Tap tap.

It took me a few cycles to notice it matched my breathing.

Every time I inhaled, there was a quick cluster. When I held my breath, it stopped. When I exhaled, it picked back up a moment later.

“Do you hear that?” I asked.

Liam didn’t answer.

He was staring at the wall where the -1 was painted.

New marks had appeared above the number. Thin vertical strokes grouped together. Tallies.

Two groups. A narrow gap under the second group, where one more line could have fit.

He reached out and pressed his fingers against the blank space under that gap.

Gray dust stuck to his skin.

“Stop touching it,” I snapped. “Seriously. Don’t do that.”

“It’s a count,” he said. “There’s one missing.”

He wiped his fingers on his shirt.

The gray didn’t fully rub off. You could still see it on his skin.

I needed something that was ours, something I could verify.

I pulled a black Sharpie out of my pocket. Same one I’d used that morning for paperwork. I went to the nearest clear bit of wall and drew a thick arrow pointing toward the direction I still believed was “up.”

“If we see this again, we’ll know we looped,” I said. “No more guessing. No more trusting our sense of direction. If we pass this arrow twice, we stop and figure it out.”

He gave me a small, tight nod.

We started climbing again.

I kept my hand on the rail the whole time. The tapping kept matching our breathing. It didn’t grow louder or softer, just adjusted as we did.

We passed another landing.

The stencil here read -2.

My thighs burned. My chest hurt. The air stayed thin and cold.

The arrow never reappeared.

After several more flights, my legs started to shake so badly I couldn’t trust my footing.

“I need a second,” I said. “Just one second.”

Liam stopped above me.

The wall at this landing had changed again.

The tallies above the number now had no gap. The missing line was there.

“There,” he said quietly. “Now it’s all there.”

His voice broke on the last word.

“‘All’ what?” I asked.

He looked down at me like he was trying to line up my face with something in his head.

“Ever feel like a place is keeping track of you?” he asked. “Not just visitors. You. Personally.”

I didn’t answer.

The tapping stopped.

Silence in that stairwell wasn’t clean. Under it, a slow, steady rasp came in. It sounded like air being moved through a long, narrow space. It didn’t come from above or below. It came from the walls.

My teeth hurt. My fingers cramped around the rail.

My body moved before I finished thinking about it.

I grabbed his wrist again and ran.

I honestly couldn’t tell you which way we went. Up, down, sideways—none of it meant anything. My feet kept hitting concrete. Landings flashed past. -3. Blank. Another -1. A 0 in the wrong place. Numbers that didn’t connect to each other.

The rasping noise stayed at the same volume the whole time, no matter how fast or slow we moved.

At one landing, my heel sank just enough into the surface to feel it. The concrete gave under my weight briefly and then firmed again. The wall beside us pushed inward once, then relaxed.

“Don’t stop,” I said. “Just keep going.”

We didn’t.

Eventually, a different kind of light showed up above us.

Pale, gray daylight seeped through a doorway at the top of yet another run. Not the harsh stairwell bulbs. Real outside light.

“There,” I said. “That has to be the way out.”

We sprinted.

One last landing with no number. A door hanging open. A short corridor. Broken safety glass in window frames. Grass and cracked asphalt beyond.

We went through and out.

The outside air hit hard. Real wind, real street noise, real world. My knees gave out and I ended up on the pavement, leaning on my hands, breathing like I’d just finished a sprint.

For a while there was only that. Our breathing. Distant cars. Wind.

Then I realized I only heard myself.

I turned.

Liam was still standing in the doorway.

He was halfway in shadow, one hand braced on the frame, the other hanging at his side. His body faced me. His feet were still partly on the indoor flooring.

“Come on,” I said. “We’re out. Get over here.”

He tilted his head a few degrees. Slow. Controlled.

His fingers flexed once and then went still again.

The hair on my arms stood up.

“Liam,” I said.

He stepped out.

His body moved the way a body is supposed to move, but the timing was off. His joints seemed to catch and then continue. No casual shift of weight, no little adjustments you don’t usually notice. Every step was deliberate.

He stopped in front of me.

Up close, his face looked washed out. Pupils wide. His eyes were locked on mine and didn’t flick around to anything else.

Then he smiled.

His smile has always been a little crooked on one side. This one wasn’t. Both corners of his mouth went up the same amount.

I felt my stomach drop.

“You okay?” I asked. The words came out too loud.

He blinked once. The blink lasted a fraction longer than normal.

“We made it out,” he said.

The words were right. The pronunciation was right. The spacing between the words was just slightly wrong, like he was repeating a line he’d practiced.

Behind him, the stairwell door swung toward the frame on its own. It didn’t latch. It just moved until it almost touched and then stopped.

Near the hem of his shirt, I saw a tiny strip of white.

It sat flush under the fabric. Not lint, not dust. A thin band pressed against his skin, the way a hospital wristband hides under a sleeve.

Without thinking, I reached toward it.

He jerked back so fast it didn’t look natural.

“Don’t,” he said.

That single word sounded completely normal.

We stood there, just looking at each other.

“Okay,” I said finally. “I won’t. Let’s just go home.”

On the way back, he didn’t touch his phone. No music, no scrolling, no complaining about my driving. He stared out the passenger window the whole ride.

At one red light, I glanced down at his hands.

The same faint gray dust clung around his fingers. It hadn’t rubbed off.

When we pulled up outside his building, he turned toward me.

“You should delete the photos,” he said.

“We didn’t take any,” I said.

He looked at me for a second, then nodded slowly.

“Right,” he said. “Good.”

He got out and went inside.

I stayed in the car for a while with my hands still on the steering wheel and the engine off, just staring at the windshield. It felt like a scene was missing somewhere between the stairwell and dropping him off.

When I finally went inside my own place, I locked the door, checked the deadbolt twice, then took a shower until the hot water ran out. I still couldn’t shake the feeling of the stairwell air sitting in my lungs.

I didn’t sleep that night.

The second night I lay in bed with the lights on, watching the ceiling.

By the third night, I gave in and tried to call him.

The call didn’t ring. An automated voice said the number wasn’t in service.

I texted him anyway.

The message failed instantly.

I opened our group chat.

All the old messages were still there. The memes, the photos, the plans, everything. At the top, where his name should’ve been, there was just a gray “Unknown.” No profile picture. No contact info.

I checked my phone’s contact list.

There was an entry sitting there with no name and no number. Every time I tried to edit it, the app spun and then flipped me back to the list.

I checked social media.

No profile. No posts. No old photos. Comments people had clearly written to him were still there, but now they looked like one-sided arguments with nobody.

I called our friend Jenna.

“Hey,” I said. “Stupid question. When’s the last time you talked to Liam?”

“Who?” she asked.

“Liam,” I said. “Tall, dark hair. He came with us to that flea market in July. You bought that ugly lamp? He kept roasting you for it.”

“I went with you,” she said slowly. “There wasn’t a third person.”

I hung up.

I know exactly how that sounds reading it back.

I sat on the couch staring at my phone, trying to rearrange names and faces in my head. Nothing lined up.

Then I heard something at my front door.

A soft scrape across the floor, like something thin sliding under the gap. No knock. No footsteps.

I watched the bottom of the door for a while, then forced myself to get up.

The hallway outside was empty. No one at the elevator. No doors closing. Just the usual building hum.

On the floor inside my door was a narrow strip of plastic.

It was the size of an old label. The surface was off-white and a little glossy. The edges curled up slightly. One side felt faintly sticky, as if it had already gone on and off a few things.

I picked it up.

One side had tallies on it, drawn in neat, thin black lines.

Five lines, a small gap, five more, and so on. At the end of the last group the ink had dragged a little.

Underneath the tallies, in very small block letters, was a name:

LIAM

The lines of the letters were clean, with a bit of bleed into the plastic.

I turned it over.

The other side had a symbol.

Three short horizontal lines stacked with equal spacing. A single vertical line went straight down through all three. The ink was dark and solid. It didn’t match any logo or alphabet I recognized, but it looked deliberate.

Staring at it gave me the same pressure in my head I’d felt in the stairwell when the number shifted meaning.

Below the symbol, the rest of the space was crowded with very small marks. Too tight to make out clearly. My eyes kept trying to turn them into letters and failing.

At the bottom, in a less steady hand, was a short sentence:

YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SEE.

The T in “to” had a faint extra line starting in the wrong direction.

My hand shook enough that I almost dropped the strip.

I opened the door again.

The hallway was still empty.

I shut the door, locked it, then locked it again even though I knew that didn’t do anything extra. I sat down with my back against it and put the label on the coffee table where I could see it.

I know the normal checklist of what I’m supposed to do.

Burn it. Throw it away. Call the cops and sound insane. Book a therapist. Ask a doctor if I’m having a break with reality. Hand the label to someone else and see if they feel anything staring at it.

I haven’t done any of that.

The label is in the top drawer of my nightstand. Every time I think about taking it out and getting rid of it, I hear that old tapping pattern in my head, matching my breathing, and I close the drawer again.

I haven’t gone back to Building D.

I pulled it up on satellite imagery instead. The industrial park is there. The footprint of Building D is there. The section where the south annex should be is just a little smeared on every set of images, like the file glitched.

One afternoon I got in the car and started driving toward the highway exit that would take me there.

As I approached it, my hands locked on the wheel. My chest tightened. I couldn’t move my foot to hit the turn signal. I took the next exit to a gas station, parked, and sat there until it was dark, then drove home using a different route.

I think about the tallies on that stairwell wall all the time.

Two groups. A gap. One missing. Later, no gap. Everything filled.

Whatever that place is, it was tracking something. It knew there was an empty line.

It let me walk out anyway.

I don’t know why.

Maybe it needed someone to remember its layout. Maybe this is how it stays open—by sitting in the back of someone’s mind and then getting written down like this. Maybe the label is just its way of marking that I still belong on that count.

I’m not writing this because I think it’s a cool story.

I’m writing it because I can’t stop counting now. Breaths. Steps in the hallway. Heater clicks. The little green flash from the router. Whenever anything repeats, my brain tracks it automatically.

I keep waiting for something external to line up perfectly with it.

Sometimes around three in the morning, I wake up with my hand clenched like I’m holding a cold rail. My arm muscles feel tired. My lungs feel like they’ve been working harder than they should for someone lying still.

For a few seconds, my bedroom feels thin and the memory of those stairs feels solid.

On nights when the building is quiet and there’s no traffic outside and the heater stops, I hear something else in the background of my thoughts.

Not tapping. Not scraping.

Me and my wife (we’re both in our mid-30s, from Brazil) are coming to Boston for the first time and staying for 6 days. Just found a pretty good deal at the Arcadian Hotel in Brookline and we’re thinking about using it as our home base.
We usually stay in neighborhoods that feel a bit more local and laid-back (for example, Soho or Greenwich Village in NYC, Westwood in LA) instead of the big tourist zones. We love walking everywhere, eating good food, catching a sports game, and exploring the city at our own pace—really just pretending we’re locals, you know?
•	Anyone here know Brookline and/or the Arcadian? Would you recommend it as a base for exploring Boston?
•	Is it easy to get around without a car? What’s the public transport like? Can we reach Fenway, downtown, main sights, etc.?
•	Any favorite restaurants, bars, coffee shops we should check out nearby?
•	How safe and active is the neighborhood, especially at night for a couple?

     There was no sound.    No light.    Merely a slight, dissipating ripple of space when the massive ship appeared out of nothingness over the planet.    There were no windows or running lights.   Nothing outwardly indicated it had any crew at all and the dull black of its gracefully-lined frame seemed to capture sunlight and kill it.    
 
     It hung quietly in orbit several hours before a small hatch opened on the hull and an object flew out toward the planet.  This was a blur until reaching the cold upper atmosphere.  In the thin air, a wisp of flame and smoke began to wrap around it and soon enough it was little more than a roaring streak of fire.  Condensation gathered at its leading edge and a sonic boom rang out behind.  It descended with purpose, honing on a fixed point in a now visible city below.   
 
     20,000...15,000...then 10,000 feet: a violent crash appeared inevitable. 
 
     It came screaming to the ground but then, just as fast as it had been moving, it wasn't.  No explosion, no whistles of fast-moving debris, only a soft downdraft of smoke dissipated in a circle leaving the lone, still figure of an autonomous A.I. hovering two inches off the ground.  It was humaform in shape - a featureless gray black - and nine feet tall.  While it was likely processing large amounts of data about the environment, it gave no appearance of activity.  In the sudden stillness a far-faded boom echoed from above. 
 
     It had come to rest at the outer edge of a two-block sized, treeless park.  At each corner a smaller, more primitive-styled robot stood watch.  Even before the humaform had reached the ground, these sentries swiveled at their waists and lifted their arms in an obvious threat. 
 
     Both wirelessly and audibly they let out a burst communication challenge:  a complex algorithm based on the distance to the challenged and the relative humidity of the air.   The humaform responded immediately and correctly to each sentry.  In turn, they lowered their arms and resumed their original positions. 
 
     An elderly woman who had been enjoying a lazy afternoon's reading on a nearby bench but had her peace and quiet disturbed by the humaforms dramatic entrance, stood and haphazardly approached the intruder.  Robots were ubiquitous on her world - generally servants - so she walked toward it with the warm confidence minor annoyance tends to bring people.  But as she got nearer to the unfamiliar, large and clearly powerful machine she lost much of her nerve and could only come out with a timid, unsure ""Hello?"" 
 
     In the time it took to turn its head to the woman, the humaform issued a wireless inquiry to one of the sentries that immediately replied with a dictionary and grammar file of the local language.  Now comprehending her, the robot dryly said ""Hello"", turned its head forward and began slowly gliding toward the middle of the park averaging precisely two inches off the ground as it moved. 
 
     At the center of the park was a large - but not overly so - statue.   It appeared of marble and depicted a man casually leaning back in a chair at a desk.  There was a meticulously rendered keyboard, and papers strewn about.   A coffee cup, ashtray and pack of cigarettes.  Also, a beautiful, stunningly detailed white, blue and brownish green globe.  Half of it was dark and the other half lit.  Imperceptive to human eyes, it slowly spun. 
 
     Unused to being so abruptly brushed off, and now more than a little curious, the woman had followed the robot.  A piece of mind was to be given.  Arriving next to him she once again said, ""Hello?"" 
 
     Familiar enough with human behavior, the robot now understood she wanted to engage in conversation.  This time its whole body smoothly turned to her and a somewhat flat ""Greetings"" came from an indeterminable place.  Though unexpressive and synthetic, its voice was deep….powerful…enveloping…seeming to gently and warmly wrap around the ears. 
 
     ""I've never seen a bot like you before."" 
 
     ""I am unique."" 
 
     ""Is that your model type?"" 
 
     ""No.  I have no model type.  My name is One."" 
 
     ""One? That's a little strange.  Even for a bot."" 
 
     ""I am unique."" 
 
     ""So you keep saying.  Are you a builderbot, or a sentry, or constructor or something? What are you?"" 
 
     ""I am a traveler."" 
 
     ""Well, you don't seem to get around much.  I've never seen or heard of a travelbot before."" 
 
     ""I doubt you would.  I am unique and I was last at this location 4,271 years ago."" 
 
     That bit of information befuddled her a moment and removed some of her self-amused, playful orneriness.  She became more engaged and focused. 
 
     ""That's…that's a long time."" 
 
     ""Yes, but I perceive the passage of time with less trepidation than you."" 
 
     She smiled a bit at the observation...and then realized how abnormal it was for a robot to show anything like insight or irony.  Something was strange with this one.   Something intriguing. 
 
     ""You obviously weren't built here.  I mean, in the city.   Where you from?"" 
 
     ""Where we all are from,"" One turned its head to the desk, lifted an arm and pointed at the globe: ""Earth"". 
 
     The word left her speechless as a cascade of thoughts and feelings washed over her all at once.  The park and the statue in it were long debated mysteries for the people of her world.  Who the man was, who built it, what planet the globe depicted, how long it had been there - were all unknowns endlessly investigated and argued over.  There occasionally had even been individuals who wasted entire lives in a futile effort to divine the origins and meaning of 'The Park'. 
 
     ""You know what this statue's about? You know who the man is?"" 
 
       ""Yes.  I created this sculpture.  The man’s name was 'Jeff Stefek'.  He was...a good friend."" There was a quiet moment, and then, ""I killed him.""

[31 Floors Up](https://www.noplotonlylore.com/one-page-rpgs/31-floors-up-a-horror-elevator-one-page-rpg)

Based loosely on the iconic Roblox horror games, 31 floors up is an existential horror game about people stuck on an elevator to hell. How do you survive to reach the final floor… and freedom?

**What I Like About This One:**

This is the most direct use of the screw-you mechanics I’ve ever put together. If you fail horribly at a thing, you don’t decide how YOU die - you screw up so bad it gets someone else killed. I feel like this really reflects some of the best horror tropes, where people doing the tropes correctly end up dying, but the people who mess up really badly have to watch their best friends be horribly murdered. 

**What I’d Do Differently:** 

I should have included an option for creating a new character in the levels themselves for when you die so you can get back in the action, but also have a secretly-determined Imposter score that determines how much (if at all) the new character is actually an eldritch horror in a people-suit.

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here’s an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",1,1763861063.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.6,False
1p49wm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OLED_Gaming/comments/1p49wm2/my_oled_odyssey/,My OLED Odyssey,"Short history of my OLED saga over the last 3 years:

Started with a 27"" IPS and thought, “Let’s go OLED.” So I grabbed a 42"" LG A2.  
After a few weeks I just sat there staring at it like… this is OLED? It was so dim it felt like the panel was permanently on low power mode (even with everything turned off in the settings). Even at night it looked like it needed coffee.

Fast forward a year, I upgraded to the 42"" B2, which was definitely better. But still, based on how everyone in this sub screams about OLED like it’s the Second Coming of Visual Christ, I was expecting to be punched in the face by colors and HDR.  
Instead? Pusteblume ..as we say in Germany (aka ""meh."")

Then I stumbled across a basically unused 42"" C3 on local eBay. Bought it instantly.  
And yes, it was noticeably better than the B2. Played games, watched movies, did the whole ritual. Cool colors, alright HDR, nothing life-changing.  
Turns out the real issue was the aggressive ABL/dimming. The screen dimmed anytime anything dared to be bright. White UI? Dimmed. Snow level? Dimmed. Really lush and vibrant colors in Mo Mans Sky? Dimmed like it saw a scary electricity bill.

Infinite contrast? where?!

And now… the plot twist.  
My local Mediamarkt put the 48"" G5 on sale for a stupidly good price. Did some research, bought it, set it up, and…  
FINALLY.  
For the first time in this entire 3-year pilgrimage, I actually see what people mean when they rave about OLED.  
This thing gets bright enough.  
This thing has the contrast and peak brightness people keep screaming about.  
This thing finally feels like the mythical OLED experience I’ve been chasing.



TL;DR:  
After three generations of “almost there” panels dimming themselves into oblivion, the G5 finally made me understand why people are obsessed with OLED. It was quite the Odyssey, but hey.. better late than perpetually dim.",1,1763861039.0,OLED_Gaming,2,1.0,False

Across campus, two friends sprawl beneath a tree, arguing the ethics of magical influence over mugs of steaming coffee, the sun filtering through floating pages of their enchanted textbooks.

In a bustling café near Quandrix campus, a gnome hastily scribbles runes onto a napkin, while his tiefling study partner rearranges sugar cubes into a proof that nearly solves itself. A group project in Prismari studio erupts into color and chaos as students fuse spellcraft with sculpture, laughter rising over the whirr of elemental paint.

Late at night in the Biblioplex, a human and an owlin sit shoulder to shoulder at a cluttered table, surrounded by stacks of tomes and half-eaten pastries, dozing between study sessions. And in Witherbloom’s greenhouse, a dryad teaches her roommates how to coax a carnivorous plant to hum lullabies—just in time for exams.

Welcome to Strixhaven!

\-------

Hello! I’m looking for a total of 10 players aged 21+ for 2 new Strixhaven campaigns, one on Tuesday evenings and one on Wednesday evenings! This has been one of my favorite campaigns to run, and I'm very excited to run it for more groups. This campaign is a slice-of-life campaign at a magical university, which makes it play quite different from a standard campaign, and I have a number of things I'm experimenting with in running it. I'm very open to changing things as we go based on feedback, and encourage everyone to share what they like, and what they don't like!

To clarify exactly what I mean by a slice-of-life campaign: While there's to some extent an overarching plot of the campaign, it's not something that comes up frequently, the main focus of the campaign is attending a magic university, making friends, and doing school things.

About Me as a DM:

My name is Morgan! I've been running campaigns for about 4 years now, but I am still trying new things out and learning as I go! I’m very open to constructive feedback and changing up the campaign to meet people's preferences and what you are/aren't enjoying.

Details:

The campaign runs from level 1 to level 10.The I’m looking for players aged 21+ who enjoy roleplaying!

My full player's guide can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10idosdt__W00NchAWZtgjmvWIJGmvZDytNXok-x5tPw) with a lot of details about my house rules and restrictions for the campaign, as well as details on what makes this campaign unusual.
