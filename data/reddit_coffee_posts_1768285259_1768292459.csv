Hey Maximizame fam! 👋

Ever feel like you're just going through the motions, wishing you could tap into that next level of energy, focus, and creativity? Me too. That's why I've been diving deep into what it *really* takes to not just live, but *thrive*. We're talking about those small, consistent shifts that add up to a dramatically more optimized life.

So, what does radical optimization even mean? For me, it's about consciously designing your days to support your goals and well-being, rather than letting them happen *to* you. It’s about becoming the architect of your own experience.

Here are a few things that have been game-changers for me lately:

*   **Morning Ritual Refinement:** Forget hitting snooze a million times. I've been experimenting with a non-negotiable 15-minute ""mindfulness anchor"" before checking my phone. This could be deep breathing, a quick gratitude journal entry, or simply sitting in silence and noticing the world wake up. It sets a calm, intentional tone for the rest of the day.

*   **""Power Blocks"" Over Multitasking:** Instead of juggling a dozen things at once, I've started scheduling specific ""power blocks"" for deep work. During these times, all notifications are off, and I'm laser-focused on *one* task. The productivity boost is insane, and the sense of accomplishment is even better.

*   **Intentional Movement Breaks:** It’s not about hitting the gym for an hour (though that's great too!). It's about integrating movement throughout the day. A quick walk around the block after lunch, some stretching while waiting for coffee to brew, or even a dance party in the kitchen to an upbeat song. Our bodies crave it, and our brains thank us for it.

*   **Digital Decluttering:** This is a big one! I've been ruthless about unfollowing accounts that don't add value, muting notifications that aren't essential, and even scheduling ""digital detox"" evenings. The mental space this frees up is incredible.

*   **Embracing ""Good Enough"":** Perfectionism can be a huge derailer. Learning to recognize when something is ""good enough"" and moving on has been liberating. It's about progress, not flawless execution, every single time.

It's easy to get caught up in the hustle and forget to nurture our inner selves. Sometimes, the biggest leaps in potential come from addressing our emotional well-being head-on. If you're finding it tough to navigate these internal shifts, remember there are places that can help you build resilience and gain clarity. You might find [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme) to be a valuable starting point.

What are some small hacks *you've* implemented that have made a big difference in your daily life? I’m always looking for new inspiration! Let's share the wisdom. 👇",1,1768292068.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1qblt4h,https://v.redd.it/96qofmbzr2dg1,"I made a small free language practice tool — early stage, feedback welcome","**Hey everyone! 👋**

I learned English through years of making embarrassing mistakes.  
The real turning point came when I met people who were patient enough to correct me without judgment. They gave me something most apps never did — a safe space to fail and try again.

That experience stuck with me. Not everyone has a patient friend like that, so I decided to build one.

That’s how **LangTwo** started.  
You pick a real situation (ordering coffee, checking into a hotel), start talking, get corrected, and move on. No pressure, no pretending — just practice and feedback that actually helps things stick.

It’s still early and definitely rough around the edges. But I’m building this around one belief I learned the hard way:  
you don’t learn languages by memorizing textbooks — you learn by making mistakes.

📱 iOS and Android apps are coming later this month.

I’d really love to hear your thoughts:

* What’s your biggest frustration with language learning apps?

I’m not trying to build “another AI language app.”  
I just want to build something people would actually come back to.

ELECTRIC Coffee Roaster (and nobody talks about it?),"I recently visited IKKIS Coffee Roasters and honestly… it’s one of the most peaceful coffee spaces I’ve ever been to.

The place is super calm and quiet. No unnecessary noise, no forced aesthetics, no trying-too-hard vibe. It’s simple, but somehow still feels premium. Warm energy, chill atmosphere, and genuinely humble people running the place. You can tell the focus here is on coffee, not hype.

The most surprising part was a casual conversation with the owner. She mentioned—very casually—that they have India’s first 8kg electric coffee roaster — the STRONGHOLD S9X.

Electric. Data‑driven. 8kg capacity.

I literally paused like… wait, WHAT? That’s a massive deal.

So obviously I asked why more people don’t know about this, or why they don’t market it more.

She just smiled and said:

“We’re bad at marketing.”


And honestly, that one line tells you everything about this place.

Instead of chasing attention, they’re quietly doing solid, forward-thinking work. Electric roasting means cleaner, more sustainable, and very clearly the future of specialty coffee. No loud branding. No flexing. Just passion, craft, and consistency.

If you’re someone who:

genuinely appreciates specialty coffee

cares about sustainability

enjoys quiet, no-BS spaces

likes supporting people who focus on craft over clout


…this place is 100% worth visiting.

Sometimes the best places aren’t the loudest ones on Instagram.

**Where:** South West Tasmania, Lutruwita

**When:** 29 December - 5 January 2026

**Conditions:** Bluebird skies for the first few days. Weather rolled in on the day we planned to go from Lake Oberon to High Moor, despite a clear forecast. My partner back home was sending daily Garmin InReach weather updates that said it was clear, but we still ended up tent-bound for a full day waiting it out.

This traverse had been on my bucket list for years. We originally planned to start a few days earlier but cancelled due to snow in the forecast. When the weather window reopened, we rebooked and committed.

We followed the Parks recommended itinerary and took it slow, which made the experience far more enjoyable for me. I am not at peak fitness at the moment after a year behind a desk, so easing into the range was ideal. If you are very fit and confident on technical terrain, you could definitely consolidate days at the beginning and end.

The Western Arthurs are raw, dramatic and relentlessly beautiful. The landscape feels prehistoric down there. 

**Day 1: Scotts Peak to Junction Creek (8.4 km)**

A muddy welcome to the range and high spirits all around.

It was a cruisy first day, perfect for settling into the rhythm of the walk. We arrived at Junction Creek in the afternoon and swam to wash off the mud.

Very glad I packed my Kindle so I could have a relaxed afternoon reading at camp.

**Day 2: Junction Creek to Lake Cygnus (7.3 km)**

Another cruisy day as we began climbing onto the ridge. The landscape shifted quickly from open plains into alpine scrub and rock.

**Day 3: Lake Cygnus to Lake Oberon (4.2 km)**

A short and easy day by Western Arthurs standards, but still stunning.

Lake Oberon is beautiful  - a deep green lake surrounded by sheer rock walls. The descent to the lakes gives you a preview of whats to come over the next 10km. 

**Day 4: Zero day at Lake Oberon**

The weather closed in overnight. Low cloud, rain, and strong winds kept us in our tents for the day.

**Day 5: Lake Oberon to High Moor (4.3 km)**

The clouds lifted and we seized the window. This was the most challenging day of the trip. The route over Mount Pegasus is steep, exposed, and relentlessly technical. Endless scrambles, pack hauling, and careful foot placement.

At one point we lost a water bladder down a crack in the rock, which was not ideal given High Moor can be a dry camp. We debated turning back but decided to continue and hope the recent rain would mean water at camp.

It took us eight hours to cover just over four kilometres. There was water when we got to camp (phew!). 

**Day 6: High Moor to Haven Lake (3.8 km)**

Another tough day, but spectacular.

The terrain remained technical, with more scrambles and narrow ridgelines.

**Day 7: Haven Lake to Junction Creek**

A few final challenges in the morning before descending off the range and back onto the plains.

The contrast was striking. After days of rock, ridgelines, and alpine tarns, we dropped back into open buttongrass and muddy track. We took the shortcut via McKays Track, cutting off four kilometres.

**Day 8: Junction Creek to Scotts Peak (8.4km)**

An early start to make the shuttle back to Hobart. A gentle walk out, legs tired but spirits high.

**Food:**

We packed extra food for weather delays and were glad we did with our zero day at Lake Oberon. I snacked less than expected overall.

Breakfasts:

* Granola with milk powder
* Instant coffee with milk powder

Lunches:

* Salami, hard cheese, sun-dried tomatoes and Kewpie mayo in wraps
* I also packed out cucumber and spinach for fresh crunch

Dinners:

* Dehydrated meals

Desserts:

* Nightly hot chocolate

Snacks:

* Lots of lollies for morale on the scramble sections
* Bars
* Chocolate
* Jerky and beef sticks
* Shapes
* Peanut butter

**Notes:**

* I would not recommend this hike unless you have solid hiking and scrambling experience. This is not a standard track walk. It is steep, exposed, slow, and unforgiving in bad weather. I have noticed it becoming more popular on social media, but this is serious alpine terrain. Conditions change quickly and rescues are difficult. Treat it with respect. That said, it is one of the most spectacular walks in Australia. Wild, remote, and utterly unforgettable.
* A rope is strongly recommended. We carried a 10 metre rope and used it frequently for pack hauling and steep sections. As a shorter person, it was easier for me to take my pack off and haul it up/down sections rather than climb with it on. It made a huge difference to safety and efficiency.
* We booked our shuttle with Tasmania Wilderness Experiences and highly recommend them. They offer transport to and from Hobart, gear storage and gas canisters if needed.
* Expect your gear to take a beating. The track is brutal on ultralight equipment. Constant pack hauling shredded both of our packs. Pack some tenacious tape and a sewing kit. 
* Native rodents are extremely bold, particularly at Lake Oberon. They chewed through our tent fabric. Hang food where possible and keep all gear sealed at night.
* It gets cold, even in summer. I didn't pack my sleeping bag liner and regretted it. Pack warm layers and a sleep system suitable for alpine conditions.
* Pants are highly recommended. Mine tore in several places but saved my legs from serious scratches and cuts.
* Most days we reached camp by early afternoon, which allowed plenty of time for swimming, reading and recovery. The slow pace is part of what made this traverse enjoyable for me.
* Trekking poles were useful on the plains but not between Lake Oberon and Haven Lake where scrambling dominates.",4,1768291835.0,UltralightAus,0,1.0,False

I’m usually a hotel-and-air-conditioning type of traveler, so when they said, “We’re taking the motorhome,” I internally braced for disaster. I imagined cramped sleeping quarters, constant noise, and everyone tripping over each other like a sitcom gone wrong. But it was amazing. The moment we hit the highway, something clicked. There’s this weird sense of freedom when your whole life for a few days is basically inside a rolling box. You can pull over for snacks whenever you want, stop at random viewpoints, take detours just because, and still have your own little space with you at all times. At one point, the latch on a cabinet broke, and while everyone else debated how to fix it, I ended up scrolling for random RV accessories online. Somehow I even ended up on Alibaba looking at organizers and foldable storage gadgets for motorhomes that I absolutely don’t own. The algorithm now thinks I live in one full-time. Even the little things felt nice, making coffee while parked next to a lake, waking up to sunlight through the windows, hearing nothing but wind at night. It felt slower, calmer. Very different from the usual wake-up-rush-shower-commute loop. By the time we came home, I caught myself daydreaming about doing it again. I finally get why some people choose the motorhome life permanently. I’m not there yet, but I’m at least motorhome-curious now.

We have been together for about two years. We study the same program, are in the same year, and we have both been working consistently for the past couple of years.

Financially, our situations look similar on paper but feel very different in practice. I do not receive any financial help from my parents. Everything I own is from my own work. I have student loans, a car payment, insurance, gas, and regular expenses. A while ago I also received about $30,000 from a lawsuit, which helped, but after accounting for school debt, my net worth is only about $5,000 to $10,000 higher than hers.

My girlfriend, on the other hand, has no student loans. Her education is fully paid for through her parents and her RESP. Her monthly expenses are significantly lower than mine, and there are times when she earns the same as me or slightly more.

Despite this, I pay for almost everything when we go out. I drive everywhere, always pick her up, and never ask for gas money. When we get fast food, coffee, or drive through places like Tim Hortons or Starbucks, I pay. When we go out to restaurants, skiing, movies, or activities, I pay. Early in the relationship it was more balanced, like I would get the tickets and she would get the snacks, but over time that has stopped. Now I pay for both. She occasionally buys snacks, but that is rare.

Recently it has started to bother me more. Today, when she paid for her own food, she kept calling herself “a baby” and said things like “you should have gotten me food” and “you do not take care of me.” She says these things jokingly and insists she does not mean them seriously, but hearing this repeatedly is starting to affect me.

I feel pressure to always be the provider. I was raised with the idea that a man takes care of the woman, especially culturally, and I value that role. At the same time, we are very close in age, education, income, and net worth. I am watching my savings shrink, and I tracked my spending and realized I spent around $650 in one month just on food and entertainment for us. With my fixed monthly costs, that is not sustainable.

We are also going on exchange to Europe soon. I will be in a more expensive country than she will, and I already feel anxious that we will have a net worth imbalance after that trip. I am scared that if I stop paying for everything or ask to split costs more fairly, she will see me as less of a man or the relationship will start going downhill.

I am looking for advice on how to handle this without damaging the relationship. How do I bring up splitting expenses or being more balanced in a way that is healthy and respectful? How do I communicate my financial stress without it sounding like I am unwilling to care for her? And how do couples navigate provider expectations when both partners are young, working, and financially independent?

I care about her and want the relationship to work, but I also do not want to keep sacrificing my financial stability or feel resentful long term.",1,1768291611.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I believe hidden mold set my immune system off due to an already compromised gut due to years *yes years :,(* of daily antibiotic usage. (My doctor thought that was an acceptable treatment for acne and I had no idea how horrid.) 

After moving out of that environment, it's taken a few years for my sleep to return to normal..which was my biggest issue at the time. I didn't even realize I had a nasal problem until my sleep problems subsided. For many years since the mold, I've had post nasal drip and stuffy sinuses from it. 

I believe I have a huge histamine problem now after treating MARCONs with a personalized spray from my doctor that was supposed to target the specific bacteria that my swab test said I had. It was negative for mold but positive for two other things that my doctor said shouldn't be in there. I now don't know what to do with my histamine challenge. Foods that have oils that oxidize quickly all have the same bizarre taste and smell to me that I've never experienced before. It's things like peanuts, coffee, mustard, honey, chocolate. All the same gross taste/smell. I've read it may be VOC's?

I don't know what to do to fix the histamine thing because I want to treat the underlying cause. I also assume it's histamine because sometimes when I go for low impact, normal walks around the neighborhood, my thighs will get ITCHY in my muscles.

Idk, histamines are new to me. I'm so confused. Does this sound like a histamine thing at all or wtf is going on?",1,1768291334.0,HistamineIntolerance,0,1.0,False

My coffee machine (Rancilio Pro Silvia X) was taken to a service centre as it was not turning on. They found a cockroach on the board. I can't see any burn marks from the picture provided but I don't know much about this stuff and if you should even see any. 

Would it be reasonable to assume this was likely the cause? There was no power surge at the time either. The machine turned on fine and a few mins later it was dead.

I've been trying for the past like 3 years to get a game started with this setting. I think im just gonna give it one final try.

I'm usually a GM in DnD but this will be more free form narrative based youll be able to ask to do basically anything as long as it makes sense but that also makes it vital to understand what you can do, so there might be a lot of learning and questions asked on both sides.

I have crafted this setting from the ground up, history, technology, factions and people. There are heavy influences from media i enjoy but i feel like ive brought enough novel input to make this a unique experience for people craving a more realistic take on the Cyberpunk genre.

I tend to obsess over details, craft and think and delve into my own imagination to create these places and the lives of the people inhabiting them but there's no meaning if there's no one to witness them. So i need real people to walk the streets, see the sights and get lost in the narative with me.

I will work with you on a character, exactly as you want them to be, rooted within the world to the best of my abilities. We will work together on a story you feel like expressing and then I'll set you free in a world of possibilities. Action, drama, subterfuge, highs and lows all at your fingertips as long as you're willing to look for them.

I am very much the kind of DM that expects my players to be equal participants in telling the story, i will not railroad, force missions etc. I will make hooks, i will do my best to create opportunities but i need my players to be proactive in attempting to follow the story. This wont work if you try to turn your decision making off and play along.

Now, enough of that. Perhaps it is time to give you a taste of what life in my world is like through the eyes of a humble character. (And a bit of my writing, but do not worry, its my job as a GM to write long material players can have shorter replies)

=======================

Mikail is a city police officer. His job used to involve maintenance on the robotic drones that patrol the inner city, but since the new overseer mark3 he's been left on wall duty.

""Perhaps it's for the best"" he thinks for himself, stepping over the rattling walkways precariously pinned to the outside of the massive structure. He sighs softly while looking down at the sheet metal face of the wall, the rusting rivets holding down all the poor patch jobs added throughout the years, threatening to pop at the slightest suggestion of force.

His job is simple, do rounds, make sure none of the outer city residents try to get past the wall. He knows he's supposed to call them ""outer citizens"" and perhaps some of them deserve that distinction but anyone foolish enough to try to scale the wall is below that title in his mind.

He stops for a second to think about what he's going to have for lunch, that cute barista from the place he frequents comes to mind but he's not going to ask her out. Not yet, maybe when he makes captain. So he settles for passing by there for another coffee as the sound of a gunshot echoes out and snaps him back to attention.

He looks down to see a man slumped over on the ground right under him, being patted down by who clearly was the shooter. His instinct is to call a medical drone but he remembers being yelled at twice for interfering with ""outer citizen politics"" and proceeds with his rounds.

He looks out at the vast buildings sprawling out in front of him, this new burst of construction in the outer city is intimidating, ""Command, you sure block C4-22 is authorized for construction above 50 floors?"" he asks, receiving the same response they've always given. A firm yes, citing that it's far enough from the wall to not cause an issue. He keeps walking...

This is Mikail's life. Constantly on the edge of two worlds. On one side the inner city, white, clean, tidy, safe. On the other, filling his mind day and night the outer city, where every color of the rainbow lives, thrives or struggles, where cops get to go on patrol, where people need the help he cannot give, where everything he thinks he wants is, but her just goes back home.

I made basically this exact post a year ago, if you messaged then but didn't get in feel free to try again, hopefully we get this working this time.

=============================

If you read all of that im hoping you are interested and will shoot me a message. Im hoping to find a few people but im also happy running this game for one person only if i don't manage to gather a party.

At our workplace, almost every day around the same time, someone will casually say “chai?” or “coffee?” and that’s it. No planning. No group chat. No schedule.

Within a minute or two, people start getting up. Laptops stay open, chairs pushed back halfway, and suddenly 6–7 of us are walking out together. Some go for tea, some for coffee, some for a quick smoke.

Those 10–15 minutes outside end up being better than most meetings.

People talk about work problems, random stuff, weekend plans, family issues, startup stress, silly jokes  everything. Seniors, juniors, interns, managers… no hierarchy during those breaks.

What I like most is that no one gets left out. If someone is new or quiet, they’re naturally pulled into the group. After a while, it stops feeling like “coworkers” and starts feeling like a small family that just happens to work together.

You come back to your desk lighter. Problems feel smaller. Work feels less heavy.

It made me realize that a good workplace isn’t just about the job or the office setup. Sometimes it’s built in small moments , standing outside with a paper cup of tea, laughing about something stupid, and feeling like you belong.

Tucked away in the Canadian northern woods sat a sleepy picturesque town. Surrounded by rolling hills ,little lakes and old pine trees. The main industry of the area came from tourism in the summer months. Folks staying in remote summer homes, canoeing on the still waters and coming through town to buy their supplies for these endeavors. During these months the small town is bustling with activity. As soon as the leaves begin to turn, everything becomes almost eerily still again. 

Rowan had lived there for almost 10 years now. Early on he fell in love with the landscape. The smell of pine,  
wet moss, shimmering water and the joy of padding a canoe in the late afternoon sunshine. It was a quiet and simple way of life. He woke up with the sunrise, fed the chickens and maybe chopped some wood for his grandparents. Afterwards he would start his shift at work. His grandparents owned a general corner store. Mostly Rowan spent his days stocking shelves, unloading heavy items ,sweeping or running the cash register. In the summer it was very busy with tourists. He enjoyed people watching, wondering where each guest had come from and where they were off to. Each day was simple, predictable even. The predictability was comforting for him. 

When he wasn't working he spent a lot of time outside. Canoeing, walking,  exploring or his most favorite activity was climbing. Trees, rocks, whatever he could possibly climb he would. Doing so with a natural ease. Ever since he was very little something called him to simply climb. In a confusing world, he was always comforted by climbing. Rowan never really found his place with other people. At least not ones his own age anyway. Being on the Autism spectrum made understanding others difficult. He always found they had a very hard time understanding him too. Often coming off to the untrained person as rude, blunt or difficult. Because of this he always felt most at ease outside, with animals and bugs who had no comments to make about him. Still, like anyone he did like to talk, to be understood and in the company of others. 

Moving to Stonecliffe at first seemed very dreamy. It was undeniably beautiful. Most people living in old farmhouses with large porches and ornate wooden carvings, not an apartment building or concrete slab in sight. The town center was small but charming with its own post office, small grocery store, corner store, coffee shop and medical clinic among a few others. It was enough to have everything you needed on a day to day basis. Settling in however came the realization that there was nothing other than that. No malls, spotty cell service, slow internet and not very many people around their own age. The few folks they'd met around town did seem rather warm and friendly, but the transition was still somewhat of a shock. There were a couple of times their parents sent them out to pickup some groceries. The cornerstore was just a block away, an easy walk with a pretty view on the way. The yellow painted brick of the store was easy to spot from afar. Inside, the smell of old wood immediately hit one in the face. Behind the checkout counter was a younger guy, around their age. He wore a cream colored sweater and a blank observant expression on his freckled features. He was polite during the brief interaction but didn't say much. Without thinking much of him they went about their business. 

 Later in the week, this mystery kid reappeared. While walking close to the outskirts of town  along one of many trails locals use, they noticed something unusual. Ahead lay some jagged rock faces on the side of the trail, making a short cliff edge painted in shimmering stone. On that ridge was a moving figure. Not an animal, as it had on a red shirt? A person. Climbing? Yes. Someone was up there climbing,  in a red knit sweater, and jeans. Standing in curiosity and awe, they tried to get a better look. Noticing a distinct mop of brunette curls and the same green converse. By the time they realized, he was at the top. Sitting up on there with his shoes hanging over the edge. Having just scaled a 50-foot ledge like it was nothing without any ropes.

After sitting up top for a bit, Rowan began to climb down. The climb down wasn't as exhilarating as the way up but required just as much focus on every single move. He remained focused, not noticing the presence waiting for him on the ground. Finally, after a couple minutes of careful descent, he took his first steps back on the grass and dirt.

Brothers,

I never thought I’d be the guy writing one of these long-term reports. For years, I couldn't even make it past Day 7. I was trapped in a cycle of shame, brain fog, and zero motivation.

Today marks **Day 288**. I am officially in the home stretch to my 360-day goal.

**The biggest changes I’ve noticed:**

* **The ""Eye Contact"" is real:** I no longer look at the ground when I walk. I can look anyone in the eye without feeling like I have a dirty secret.
* **Mental Clarity:** That constant ""cloud"" in my head? It’s gone. I can focus on work for hours, and my memory has improved significantly.
* **Emotional Resilience:** Life still hits hard, but I don't run to a screen to hide anymore. I face the stress, I feel it, and I move through it.
* **Energy:** I don't need 3 cups of coffee to function. The natural energy is back.

**How I got here (My 2 tips):**

1. **Don't count the days, make the days count:** After Day 90, I stopped obsessing over the number. I focused on building a new version of myself (gym, reading, social skills).
2. **The ""5-Second Rule"":** Whenever an urge hits, I have 5 seconds to stand up and leave the room. If you stay in the same environment as the urge, you’ve already lost.

**The Final Sprint:** My goal is 360 days—a full circle of healing. I’m not doing this for a ""streak"" anymore; I’m doing this because I refuse to go back to that dark room.

If you’re struggling on Day 1, 14, or 30—**DO. NOT. GIVE. UP.** The version of you that exists a year from now is begging you to keep going today.

1qbl9zr,https://i.redd.it/c5zgq5l1m2dg1.jpeg,How do you guys feel about what a Moka coffee should taste like?,"I've been brewing in a Moka pot since I started recently and I've been enjoying it. But to be honest, it is producing a kind of bitter coffee. I am adding a little sugar or jaggery to mask the bitterness, and then only I can taste what the packaging says.

And this is not only about bitterness, in case of certain beans that are high in acidity, the sourness is also too much for me to drink it straight. So I have to again add a little sugar and only after that I can characterize the flavour profiles of the beans I'm using. 

The thing is, I am absolutely not interested in tasting too bitter or too sour coffee, I don't see the appeal in it. But I'm also not gonna drink a sugary drink; I can drink coke for that. So is it normal that I have to add sugar to taste 'the real thing'? Like salt brings the real taste of all the spices used in a dish towards the front so it tastes better? Or am I doing something wrong with the moka? 

Or is it just how Moka coffee tastes like, because of the mechanics of the pot or cuz of the beans that are mostly medium/medium-dark roasts? 

I have both underextracted and overextracted and I am pretty sure I am confident in what I'm doing right now by following all the Moka-101 basics right. So is it just how it's like, or there's something that I'm not doing, that can produce a more balanced cup?

1qbl6au,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1qbl6au/how_to_support_my_mom_after_she_fled_her_abuser/,How to support my mom after she fled her abuser?,"My (40sF) mom (60sF) I’ve been married to my narcissistic father for over 40 years. He’s been equally abusive to her, my sibling, and me and we all have deep trauma. We are immigrants to the US, and I was the first one in my 20s to understand what was happening, and start getting therapy for it. I secretly moved out of their house as an adult and try to keep a low contact relationship, but it didn’t work because he tried to attack me one day so I cut him out entirely.

She continued to live with him because she was powerless to leave for all of the reasons we know, and my sibling continued to interact with him because they wanted to make sure she was OK. Despite not talking to him, I watched close with her for that decade and we saw each other secretly every week. I even moved close to her workplace so we could have secret coffees after work. 

Fast forward to a few months ago, when my sibling finally got absolutely fed up as well and stopped interacting with him. He then did a narcissistic discard on my mother and filed for divorce.

She knew that she couldn’t stand in that house during the divorce process because he would probably kill her so he can keep all the money. So she moved in with me in my tiny apartment. 

It’s been a few months and I’m helping her with the divorce but the whole thing has been hard on both of us. I am so glad that she’s out of there – I’ve been waiting for this day since I was a child.

The thing is, I don’t think I’m the best at being trauma informed for her because I have the complicated feelings wrapped up in it and I’m overwhelmed with the divorce logistics. After I fled from living with him, it took years for the nightmares to stop. My CPTSD never went away and it even recently triggered a life altering chronic disease. 

But I’ve forgotten what it was like in those first couple of years after fleeing to be completely unable to think and just go through the motions of bare minimum, making food and going to work and nothing else. She’s now in that state and I really want to support her but it’s challenging because she needs to actively work on this divorce. He’s pushing stuff through the court system, and if she doesn’t participate, she will lose every penny she has ever worked for.

But she’s been ripped out of her home without notice, has to figure out complex financial matters while also processing the emotional trauma and triggers. I want so badly to nurture this time for her. 

I would love some advice from survivors on how you navigated the trauma of being freshly away from your abuser, while also navigating divorce or logistical changes?

What kinds of things were helpful to hear from the people around you that gave you the faith to keep going?

Any advice on how I can best support my mom?",1,1768289613.0,NarcissisticSpouses,0,1.0,False

I was diagnosed with POTS about a month ago after having moderate symptoms for around 6 months. I am not on medication, as I am an athlete (I rock climb competitively) the cardiologist I saw didn’t want to put me on anything that might impair my performance. Additionally, I live in Alaska, so resources, especially with medical stuff, is extremely limited.

However, since being diagnosed, my symptoms have only gotten worse. My HR ranges from 45-190, even on the days I don’t workout. I am fatigued and feel weak and exhausted almost all of the time. I’m drinking so much water and electrolytes, I’m taking calcium and vitamin B and D. I’m doing all of the things the cardiologist said to do, yet I’m feeling so much worse. My climbing is struggling, I have zero capacity and my heart rate is 170+ after every single warmup climb. I’m always too cold or too hot, I’m always weak and dizzy, constantly shaky. I work at a coffee shop that requires me to be on my feet for 8 hours a shift. I had to ask my manager to cut down my shift length and my hours because I’m struggling so much. Every time I get home from school, practice, or work, I completely crash and I am basically unable to do anything for hours. There’s days where I have all 3 and I can barely get out of bed the next day. 

I’m struggling to climb, play my instrument, spend time with friends and family, and do literally anything that brings me joy. I am doing everything I was told to do and I’m feeling worse and worse. I’m taking an extra class this semester but I’m afraid that I’m going to have to end up dropping classes because of my health. POTS is actively ruining my life, I wouldn’t wish this upon my worst enemy.

1qbkyf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1qbkyf5/my_wife_is_a_skinwalker/,My wife is a skinwalker.,"Hello everyone, I know the title is strange and outlandish but I swear its true, I swear im not insane.

 It all started in the forests of Montana on a summer night in 1996. The night that will forever bewilder and terrify me for the rest of my life. 

The night of June 3rd 1996 I was riding through the forest on old black top. I was riding my Indian motorcycle, I loved that thing it was a beautiful dark red with chrome trim. That night as I was riding I saw something watching me in the trees but it was just a glimpse. 

Kinda like when you turn your head too fast in low light and you think you saw a shadow move? I noticed it but didn't think anything of it but a few minutes later I saw it again but it was a little closer this time, leaning out from behind a evergreen tree. Still kept driving, thought my mind was playing tricks on me, you know how it is late at night surrounded by darkness and forest Your mind makes up all kinds of shadowy figures and horrors when it can't see something. Well this time it wasn't a trick.

 Feeling a bit paranoid I sped up, trying to get out of the woods as fast as I could without crashing but thats when I saw her... on the left side of the road leaning out from behind it was a woman or at least she resembled a woman. She stood at least 8 feet tall with eyes white as snow and skin pale as parcelin, her mouth almost reached her ears and her teach were as big as fingers. I saw her and froze in fear and disbelief, i stared as I rode past and she stared back and I swear to god I saw her blush. 

I crashed that night staring at what I thought was a demon or a wendigo or some eldritch horror. Turns out I was staring at my future wife. I don't remember much after the crash, just waking up in the hospital, with some broken bones and a ginger ale. I asked the nurses what happened and what happened to my bike but they said I didn't come in on a bike, just that a woman with black hair and pale skin carried me into the emergency room and asked the nurses for help, they took me  and when they turned back to ask for information she was nowhere to be found.

A week later I was discharged from the hospital and my brother drove me home to my house just on the edge of town. He asked if I wanted him to stay with me few days to help around the house but I thanked him and refused.

 You know wherever I rode, I always wore my leather jacket, it was an Indian motorcycle jacket with red stripes on the sleeves and when I crashed I was wearing it but I know I wasn't going fast enough destroy it because my leather pants were only slightly damaged so where could it possibly have gone? I tried to remember what happened that night but I was too drugged up amd in too much pain so I resigned myself to sleep. 

The next few days were painful but manageable. The pain was receding slowly and I was starting to remember little details about the crash but not much. I started having some terrible nightmares though, always of that... thing that woman staring back at me and blushing. I thought maybe the nightmares were a side effect of the pain medicine but I was wrong. 

They had been getting worse and worse with each night like and they were always about her, about those damn woods in the first nightmare she was far away peaking at me from behind a tree with those pale snowy eyes and that jet black hair with that damn creepy smile but the most confusing and disturbing part is she was always blushing as she stared at me. 

Every night it was the same dream over and over but with each night she was behind a new tree that was closer to me. I thought I was losing it, surely these dreams must have been brought on by the drugs so one night I decided to skip my pain medication and go straight to bed. Unfortunately that didn't make a difference. 

This time when I had the nightmare she was gone, just gone! I was relived at first but something felt off. Why after nights of getting closer amd closer with that creepy blush would she suddenly dissappear? That's when I felt something that made my bones ache with fear and heart stop dead, I looked down and saw arms around my chest, I looked up and saw her glaring down at me with an eerily gleeful look in her pale eyes and a blush red as fresh blood coloring her cheeks.

 I shot up out of my sleep and grabbed my chest, breathing deeper than ever before, gasping like a dead man woken from his slumber. It was morning so I got up and made some coffee trying to calm my nerves and relax. I saw the beautiful morning sun rising and decided to go outside and watch the sun rise from my front porch but when I opened the door I found my leather Indian jacket on the mat with a long jet black hair on the collar...

To be continued... maybe.

1qbkumi,https://i.redd.it/zzav0qedh2dg1.jpeg,AIO- Should I have disclosed that I’m Deaf earlier?,"For context, we exchanged about ten messages and things were going well. Easy conversation, mutual interest, and we even made plans to meet for coffee. Before the date, I made a decision that felt important to me. I told her that I am Deaf. My intention was not to overshare or make it a big thing. I just did not want to catch someone off guard in person or put either of us in an uncomfortable situation. To me, being upfront felt respectful and honest.

Unfortunately, that honesty backfired. After I shared that I am Deaf, the energy completely shifted and the connection pretty much ended before we ever met. That part stung. Not because anyone owes me a date, but because it was a reminder of how quickly people can make assumptions based on one piece of information.

Being Deaf is just one aspect of who I am. It does not define my personality, my values, my humor, or my ability to connect with someone. I communicate, I adapt, and I navigate the world every day just fine. Still, moments like this make it clear that some people see disability before they see the person.

I am sharing this not to shame anyone or play the victim, but because it highlights a reality that does not get talked about much in dating. There are probably a lot of things people have not disclosed yet on either side, and that is kind of the point of going on a date. You learn those things by showing up, having coffee, and seeing if there is chemistry.

I still believe being honest upfront was the right choice. I would rather lose a potential date than start something by hiding part of myself. It just sucks sometimes when doing the right thing comes with a quiet rejection and no real conversation attached to it.

If nothing else, it was a reminder that the right people will not see accessibility as a deal breaker but as a normal part of being human.",95,1768288431.0,AmIOverreacting,138,0.76,False

Why, just why? It is precisely because of this type of directing that I gave up on Better Call Saul: just too much filler to actually care in the end about the good bits that would come here and there.

Endless treks reveal hidden viewpoints over valleys that stretch to infinity, dotted with spice plantations and playful langurs. At dusk, fireflies light up the canopy like stars fallen to earth, turning every trail into a whispered secret of serenity.

But I gave it a shot since I had just bought a bunch of stuff during the holiday sales. Turns out a few items already dropped in price, and the extension caught them automatically.

Got $256 back total from Amazon. Mostly from a coffee maker and some electronics. The whole process was pretty hands off, which was nice because I didn't have to sit in chat queues myself.

I've also identified my triggers and how to deal with it. It's not as terrifying as it used to be, but what happened today was pretty bad. 

My SP almost always happens within the context of dreams while I'm still asleep. The context never stays the same, but more likely than not it's because someone or something is sitting on top of me. Today I was running on very little sleep, drank a big coffee, and decided to take a nap. My dream started to have very nightmarish things happen, mostly I was running around trying to get a lot of things done but my body kept freezing. I then had about 4 false awakenings in a row before realizing ""shit this is SP, I gotta wake up for real."" Started doing my tricks to ""unfreeze"" from SP, wiggling fingers and toes, clenching and unclenching, until I was finally fully awake.

This was the biggest episode I have had in a very long time and it shook me a little bit. But it also serves as a reminder that no bad it might seem in the moment, it always passes. But maybe if I took the effort to fix my sleep schedule I could prevent this in the future. Oh well, c'est la vie.",1,1768287715.0,Sleepparalysis,0,1.0,False
1qbkjy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qbkjy1/the_daughters_of_the_womb/,The daughters of the womb,"My wife said she was pregnant, even though we knew it was impossible.

The supernatural world is so vast and diverse that it's hard to believe anyone could have experienced something like this.

She was completely normal. A mother of two daughters. That warm night, without any prior argument or strange signs, she spoke to me with absolute calm:

""I have two more daughters in my womb.""

I looked at her, confused.

""Honey… you're not pregnant. You've had surgery. Me too, a vasectomy.""

She shook her head slowly.

""I know. But they're here. I can feel them.""

I didn't feel paranormal fear. I felt real fear. I thought it was a medical problem, something happening inside her body or mind. Even so, I approached and placed my hand on her stomach.

Then I felt it.

Two presences colliding.

I immediately pulled away. I turned to get out of bed and get her some water. At that moment, two hands gripped my back.

I turned around.

""They're born,"" she said.

There were two babies on the bed.

Their features were human, but strange. They weren't ugly or beautiful.

Something about their faces contradicted everything we knew. Even so, we took them to the clinic.

The nurses were astonished. Not by their physical condition—everything seemed normal—but by the discomfort they said they felt when approaching them. Something they couldn't explain.

Days later, after the paperwork, we returned home.

Two men were waiting for us outside.

""Can we come in?""

We accepted without suspicion. They sat in the living room. They declined coffee. They looked at the car.

Then I swore that one of the twins cried.

My wife got up immediately.

""It's okay, love,"" he said, approaching the car.

One of the men didn't take his eyes off her.

""Since when have you seen them like this?"" he asked.

They didn't answer when we spoke.

They only asked:

""Can we carry them?""

""We were referred by health services,"" they added.

We nodded.

When they lifted the blankets, there was no crying.

There was no movement.

One of them looked at my wife.

—Where did they get them this time?

They opened the car.

There were no babies.

There were two small skeletons, carefully wrapped.

I felt a void in my head.

Then I remembered.

Fifteen years ago.

The same night.

The same words.

We went upstairs.

Our daughters were in their beds.

They weren't asleep.

They weren't breathing. They were still alive.

That was the worst part.

They were still there.

Petrified.

Just like ever since.

The man looked at me wearily.

""You saw them as babies too,"" he said.

""Both times.""

And I understood something worse than horror:

It wasn't the first time.

It was a repetition.",1,1768287375.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1qbkatx,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/1qbkatx/i_have_no_friends_and_its_my_last_semester/,I have no friends and it's my last semester,"Today was the worst first day back. I slept very poorly at 4 am and only slept for 4 hours. It's about to be 1 am now today, soon to be the second day of classes, and I'm suffering from insomnia again. I tried to sleep early but couldn't, so I had to write here because I couldn't continue suppressing this. I've been suffering from insomnia for years on end now. It doesn't help that my health is already poor (I'm registered with D&A). But what really sucks is that if I was in an emergency, I absolutely know no one is gonna care.

My roommates, for one don't give a fuck. The door was locked when I tried to get in, and when they opened the door, I said ""hi"" with a smile, only to get ignored. No ""happy new year"", no ""how are you"". They don't  treat me like a human being. Then it's the fact that I spent my entire day just going from class to class, feeling hella exhausted and in pain and feeling like I was going to faint. If I ever collapsed in my room, my roommates would probably wouldn't even know. Or they'd just let me die there.

And then of course, the people in my major also don't really give a fuck about me. They've known me for years, and I saw a few of them were in the same class this semester, so I thought to bring up the courage and reach out to study together, only to see that they'd formed a clique right away where there's absolutely no room for me.

If I act one bit like a human and not like a robot that goes with the motions they want me to, people cut me off immediately. I know someone who cut me off just because I was struggling with understanding a concept in class, simply because I had slept for like 3 hours. Yes, they removed me from their social media, deliberately sat away from me, and talked loudly during the professor's lectures with their friend, so I couldn't hear the professor speaking. I asked them what was up and they gave back plausible deniability.

People I know that are in my classes never reach out or say hi or ask how I'm doing or anything. And I mean genuinely. When I say hi to them or smile at them, I don't even get proper responses. They're always looking somewhere else at other people. People I thought I was friends with don't ever ask to hang out or grab coffee or anything. I have done it, but they don't reciprocate. They'll say bye to colleagues in front of my face, and never me, or walk off when I try to say something to them. People are rude sometimes. I'm tired.

I know I shouldn't complain or rant like this. But I really feel like my days this last semester are just gonna be me going to class, back to my room, and just alone. I keep thinking, maybe I should bury myself in schoolwork as I always do to get through the way people treat me, but that's obviously not the solution. It's going to backfire.

The isolation is too much. I feel like a ghost. Someone who doesn't interact with anyone, someone who isn't truly seen or understood or even wanted to be understood. And if I don't get a good sleep or have good health, well, I don't know how I'm supposed to even walk around to classes. And holy shit, no one I know even knows or cares whether I'm there or not. It's that bad. People know I might be suffering and don't care either way. It's been like this my entire experience at college. Everyone seems to have their circles, their contacts. I have no one. Absolutely no actual friends who care to reach out except when likely convenient for them in some way. I'm so sick of this.

Moving forward I went to his house again and I had ONE beer and I just felt loose and I don’t get drunk easily, I have a high tolerance. He ordered pizza, we were watching a movie, we wrestled lmao I like to think I’m stronger that a man, specially the ones that could definitely kill me immediately 🤣. Then he was like initiating and I said no cause I was on my period (it was a lie, I needed my Brazilian wax and to shave my legs) but I did ended up giving him a blowjob, he finished and I was fine like I love when people enjoys it, ANYWAYS, I spent the night and after that day he just became weird, started texting later but hanging me in there. My only concern is, did I do a bad job? 🥲 hahaha or what the fuck happened? Was he thinking highly of me and I screwed up with that? Like I don’t know it’s confusing, we haven’t even talked on the FWB thing fully, when we started talking I expressed I can’t do that cause I catch feelings and he said he wasn’t looking for anything but I’m good, I just left a relationship and this is perfect but I do need to build a certain connection to have good sex, I’m opened to talk it out but now he’s acting differently. What should I dooo. I’ve thinking on expressing this but also for what purpose?? ",1,1768286184.0,dating_advice,10,1.0,False

*For you were the snake all along*



These were the last words my wife wrote to me before she left. A poem masquerading as a letter. I still remember the way I felt as the words danced in my mind. I remember the searing pain that twisted my heart, like the hands of betrayal had reached into my chest. I remember the sorrow that covered my body, crushing me under its infinite weight. I remember the anger that burned from my gut, and engulfed me in flame. How could she toss away our life? In sickness and in health, til death do us part. That's how it is supposed to be, right?

These thoughts permeated in my mind for the first six months. I was comatose in consciousness, trapped in a reality that I begged to leave. The blizzard of grief assaulted my body daily, and I had lost the protection of my coat of love. My thumb bruised as I scrolled through social media, praying that she posted, giving some modicum of a hint to where she could be. My eyes strained staring at the door, begging for the day she returned. My knuckles bloodied from how I held her pillow, believing that if I squeezed hard enough, it would turn into her. I felt like a man on the edge of starving to death, yet everyday, I was given a slice of bread to keep me alive. 

Yet, about half a year ago, something changed. Call it survival instinct, or processing the grief, or even the fear of losing the life I had cultivated, but a fire relit inside of me. So, my search had begun. 

Our entire life, my wife and I had lived the American dream. We lived in the epitome of suburbia, a nice fenced off community with some protected woods just behind our backyard. I worked a comfortable office job processing insurance claims, making six figures a year. My wife, on the other hand, stayed home and took care of my two sons. I was so happy to see we had boys. It meant more opportunities for my legacy to be carried on.

My wife was fantastic at raising my first son. He was a resolute boy, on the path to becoming a real man. He was strong as a bull, stubborn as an ox, and knew how to suffer in silence. I looked at him with so much pride. He would grow to be the perfect man.

My wife was not so skilled with my second son. Where my oldest was strong, my youngest was weak. Where my oldest was stubborn, my youngest was meek. My youngest always cried, always voiced soft emotions. He was not a protector. He would live a life of lonely suffering. It was my job to make sure he wouldn't.

So, I won't lie, I was hard on the boy. I grounded him. I worked him. Hell, I even spanked him. Anything to toughen him up. I had to protect the boy, even if I had to become the villain in his story. But my wife doted on him. Whenever I was done, the boy would run to his mother, tears in his eyes. She would hold him, cooing sweet comforts in his ear, and call him her ""sweet shepherd."" And then she would glare at me, eyes filled with anger and spite. Those were the only times my wife and I would fight.

But then, on a fateful summer day, three years ago, things changed. My oldest boy was 9 at the time, and my youngest was just a year younger. It was a hot day in June, when my wife was cooking lunch in the kitchen. I was in my study, completing paperwork from the week. Through my window, I could hear my boys playing""Tarzan"" in the backyard, leaping from branch to branch in that large oak tree we had. It was our normal weekend routine in the summer.

My work was suddenly interrupted by the sounds of yelling, not of play, but of annoyance. I looked out the window, and saw my youngest son crying, sitting on one of the lower branches of the tree. My oldest son was scolding him from above, pushing him to try harder. The scolding only made my youngest son cry harder.

""Be nice to your brother!"" I heard my wife's voice call out across the kitchen. I took note of the sharp sternness of her tone. As of late, she always spoke to my oldest boy that way. I felt a tinge of anger spark in my gut. My oldest was doing exactly what he should. He was protecting his younger brother. Taking a breath, I swallowed my anger, and went back to the paperwork.

Around half an hour later, I heard a yell followed by the high pitched scream of my wife. I dropped my pen, and ran as quickly as I could down the stairs. As I turned into the kitchen, I saw my wife already outside, kneeling in the ground underneath the tree. Though her back was turned to me, I could tell she was cradling something. 

My pace slowed. I could feel a pressure squeeze my mind as I walked forward. My heart pounded in my ears. My world swirled around me as if I was hit with a bout of vertigo. Yet, I swallowed it. Thus was my duty as a man.

As I walked forward, adopting a mask of calm, the pounding of my heart still assaulted my ears. I could see my wife's head ripped backwards, her mouth wide in a scream. Yet, no scream hit my ears. 

As I continued forward, I looked up into the tree. I saw my eldest son, his tear stained eyes wide in horror. His mouth was forming the words, ""I'm Sorry.""

My youngest son was nowhere to be seen.

As seconds ticked on like hours, I continued my approach. Finally, I could see what my wife was holding. My heart plummeted into my stomach, and I felt my mask of calm crack.

In my wife's hands, hanging loosely at a sickening angle, was the head of my youngest son, his face painted forever with fear. 

As my wife looked up at me, tears in her eyes, an army of thoughts marched through my synapses and breached my brain

*Keep it together. It's his fault. That's my son. It's his fault . Keep it together. My son is dead. It's his fault. You should have paid more attention. It's his fault. It's your fault. It's his fault. Why wasn't she watching him better? It's his fault. Keep it together.*

*IT'S HIS FAULT.*

The invasion of thoughts was interrupted by something grabbing my hand. The world went silent. The thoughts disappeared. My heartbeat skulked back into my chest. I turned my head to the thing holding my hand. I saw the boy, the boy in the tree, staring up at me with apologetic tears staining his face.

""Dad, I'm sorry.""

I felt words crawling through my throat, yet chains of anger held them back. I stared at the boy, the failure, and my mask of calm cracked in half. As it fell, my face contorted in rage. I stared into the eyes of the boy, and every tear that escaped his eyes only added fuel to my anger.

*It's his fault*

I am not proud of what I did next. I lost control of my emotions. I failed in my duty as a man.

Without saying a word, I struck the boy with the back of my hand. The boy fell hard to the ground. My wife screamed. I looked at my hand, and saw blood covering my knuckles, the skin punctured in the strike.

""Get up."" I said.

""Dad, please. I am sorry."" The boy stammered, trying to scoot away from me.

""I said 'get up.'"" I grabbed the boy by his collar, and pulled him to his feet.

""Dad, I didn't mean to. He... He kept saying couldn't get up. He kept asking me for help. I just wanted him to do it on his own. That's what you always...""

""Why are you crying?"" I asked, my eyes stabbing into the boy.

""Because Abe is...""

""Men don't cry."" I said, looking at my youngest again.

""I didn't mean to.""

""Men protect their family."" I said again, more to myself than the boy.

""Dad, I tried, really.""

""Men take responsibility. Are you going to take responsibility?"" I asked, turning back to the boy. 

""Dad, it was an accident!"" The boy screamed, tears flowing even harder. ""Please! I am sorry!""

""I guess not."" I said, turning and walking away. I heard the boy pleading with me from a distance, but his cries fell on deaf ears. Men take responsibility, after all. Men protect their family. If he wouldn't, then I would.



The entire time, my wife never moved.

Over the next week, I made several calls. My wife fought me on every step. She wanted to keep the boy around. But even she eventually relented. By the end of the week, the paper work was signed, and the boy was sent away. We would never see him again.

In the aftermath of the loss of my son, and the exile of the boy, my wife seemed to be in a catatonic state. She never left my son's room. Whenever I would pass by, I would see her laying in his bed, holding onto his pillow. Her face was still painted with the make up from that day, the cosmetics faded to where they could no longer hide the acne that developed on her face. Her hair, matted in knots, was weighed down with oil and filth, and stained the pillow she clung to. Her eyes, wide with shock, were lined with bloodshot veins that reached for her iris from puffy red rings. 

I tried to be sympathetic to my wife for the first few months. It was ok for her to feel what she was. As the man of the house, I would carry the burden of maintaining our life. I would take care of the finances, I would take care of the house work. I would take care of it all, until she was functional again. 

But as the months passed, and my wife continued to wallow, I found my patience beginning to thin. The time wasn't easy for me either, you see. My anger never faded. Every morning, I woke to a cold bed. I would look in the mirror, and see my son, lost to time, staring back at me. Small annoyances at work turned into frustrating problems. I found myself making more mistakes filing paperwork, and my bosses were breathing down my neck. 

So, I stopped doing my wife's duties. I stopped taking food to her. I stopped cleaning. I focused on my work only. Yet, instead of coming home after work, I found myself in what became my second home.

Filthy Eddie's was a bar that I had frequented in my college days, back when my wife and I transitioned from friends to lovers. It was a fine little dive bar—the only sanctuary where men could meet and expunge the emotions they bottled up. There was a kinship in our independent suffering. It was our garden. Our sanctuary.

I stopped being able to go as much since getting married and having kids. Thus was the responsibility of fatherhood. I hadn't realized it, but I had missed seeing my brothers. I missed my true home.

""Holy fuck, is that Adam?""

The words echoed through the quiet bar as I entered the building. I looked up at the source of the words, and smiled. I saw my old friend, the titular Filthy Eddie, standing behind the bar. In that moment, I became painfully aware how long it had been since I had been home 

Filthy Eddie got his name from his crass humor. He had a knack of turning any conversation into one of debauchery, and the man's language was as foul as his comedy. Yet, people looked past it. At the time I frequented the bar more, Eddie looked like everyone's funny uncle. He had a rotund belly that jiggled whenever he laughed, which filled the room with warmth. His blue eyes were always shining with joy, and wrinkles formed from how much he smiled. His face was lined in a thick, matted beard that always smelled of sandalwood.

But that wasn't why people forgave Eddie. No, Eddie had a knack of making you feel like family. Every word he said was dripping with kindness. He knew when to listen, and when to talk. And when you were in front of Eddie, boy did you talk. He just had that energy that told you that you could trust him. 

The man standing behind the bar was not that Eddie. Sure, he still had those smile lines, and those joyous blue eyes, but no longer was his face lined with facial hair. His once slick, black hair was grayed and balding. His face was covered in wrinkles, making him look much older than his 56 years of age. But the biggest change was that his rotund belly was gone. He stood like a stick now, and his clothes hung loosely off his body. I felt a stab of pain in my heart seeing how much had changed.

""Hey there, Stranger,"" I said, forcing a chuckle, ""seen Eddie around?""

""Very funny, kid."" Eddie laughed, and I noticed it was significantly weaker than it used to be. ""So funny, I nearly fell on my ass. Come, have a drink. First one is on me. For the return of the prodigal son.""

I sat down in the spot I used to sit in, and I felt the anger already begin to subside. Finally, I felt at home again. 

""You look different, kid."" Eddie said, sliding a beer over to me.

""I should be the one saying that."" I chuckled, this time more genuinely. ""What happened to you?""

""Stomach Cancer."" Eddie replied casually, as though he was saying the weather forecast. ""Got the big fucking C. Kicked its ass though."" He laughed.

""I am sorry, man."" I said, taking a drink.

""Why?"" Eddie perked up an eyebrow. ""I lived. Cancer free for a couple years now. I just haven't bounced back from the chemo, is all. Now, stop avoiding the question, kid. How are you doing?""

I looked into Filthy Eddie's eyes. He stared back at me, as if he already knew the answer. My heart twisted a bit. The look felt all too familiar for some reason.

""I am doing fine."" I said back, taking another drink.

""Come now, kid."" Eddie gave a friendly smile. ""Don't be lying to Filthy Eddie now. These eyes see everything. You look about as fine a 2 cent ass on a grandma. Talk to me.""

""I said 'I am fine,' Eddie."" I forced a smile. ""But cancer, huh? Glad to see you survived. Must have been hard.""

""Eh, harder for the ladies than me."" Filthy Eddie let out another weak laugh. ""Thing about chemo, makes the ol' oak tree soft. Poor gals lost all potential of seeing my skills.""

""Yeah, sure man,"" I said, rolling my eyes. ""I still don't know how you bring everything back to your sex life.""

""When something is a masterpiece, you talk about it, kid."" Eddie smiled. ""It's like when you're talking about movies and shit. You gotta mention the fucking *Godfather* everytime. And just like *The Godfather*, everyone loves my dick.""

""Eddie,"" another patron called over. ""That's two dollars now."" I watched the man gesture to a jar labeled ""Eddie's Dick Jar."" Eddie laughed again, and put two dollars in the jar.

""We make him do that every time now."" The patron leaned over, and said to me, ""He kept scaring away all the ladies that came in.""

""Why is that a bad thing?"" I asked. 

""C'mon man."" The patron said. ""Nothing wrong with a bunch of guys hanging out, but ladies add some spice. If all you do is spend time around men, people start asking questions.""

For the first time, I genuinely looked at the patron. He was young, young enough that I questioned if he even belonged in the bar. His light brown mullet peaked out underneath a Royals baseball cap. He had a thin moustache, if you could even call it that, on his upper lip. His green eyes looked over at me like he was the smartest guy in the world.

""Men don't concern themselves with that,"" I said, taking a drink.

""Name's Gabe, by the way,"" the young man said, extending a hand out. 

""Nice to meet you,"" I said back, ignoring his hand and drinking my beer.

""Kid, you are never this rude,"" Eddie said, leaning against the bar next to me. ""What's going on?""

I turned my attention back to his eyes. As much as I tried to fight it, I could feel the words launching themselves out of my mouth.

""Well, it's my wife..."" I started, staring into my beer.

""Eve?"" Filthy Eddie asked. ""What's wrong with her, kid?""

""Well, we had this incident a few months back. My son. He... Well... He fell out of a tree."" I felt Eddie's hand place itself on my shoulder.

""We heard, kid. How is Kane doing?""

""Don't say his name!"" I spat back. I felt my stomach flare in anger. Even after all this time, I couldn't forgive the boy. I squeezed the glass until my knuckles turned white.

""Kid, he is still your son."" 

""No. He isn't."" I glared into Eddie's eyes. My stomach grew hotter. Those blue orbs, normally so friendly, stared back at me in pity. I didn't need his pity. I did the right thing. My son died because he was too weak. He died because my wife failed him. The boy got sent away because he let my son die. I did everything right. Yet, despite how righteous the anger felt, part of it still burned me.

After what felt like minutes of staring, I pulled out my wallet. Pulling out a $20 bill, I slammed it on the table. I quickly got to my feet, and made my way towards the door.

""Come on, kid. I told you the first drink is on me. Come back. Let's talk.""

I ignored him. As I turned the door handle, I paused for just a second. I could feel his eyes on me, staring into my soul. Part of me wanted to go back, and just let it all out. But I couldn't. I wouldn't.

That night, when I got home, I walked past my son's room. There was my wife, laying in bed, still holding that pillow. The anger from the bar hadn't subsided. In a rage, I flipped on the light, and yelled at her.

I don't remember what I had said. I just remember yelling for hours. Maybe I shouldn't have. She was grieving. But I couldn't do it alone. Not anymore. All I remember was, by the time the yelling was done, she had agreed to shower and return to bed.

That night, even with my wife back in our room, the bed never felt colder.

As the months continued, we returned to our normal routine. My wife kept up with the housework, and I continued with my job. I started making less mistakes, and my bosses even started taking notice of my improved performance. My wife and I were fighting less, and we were even intimate a few times. Life seemed to be getting better.

Then, one day, on a chilly October morning, my wife entered the kitchen. I was drinking my morning coffee, and responding to emails, when she sat across the table from me.

""Hey,"" she said, her eyes staring down at the table. ""We need to talk.""

""What about?"" I asked, still scrolling through emails on my phone.

""I... I got a job."" 

I looked up from my phone, and felt a vein twitch above my temple.

""Why did you do that?"" I asked, trying to maintain my calm.

""Without the kids here, there isn't as much to do,"" she replied, looking up at me. ""I need something to keep me busy.""

""So pick up a hobby,"" I said, putting my phone down. ""Take up knitting, or crochet, or painting.""

""I want to work.""

""Things are finally going back to normal, Eve,"" I said. ""Why are you trying to ruin that?""

""I'm not.""

""Yes, you are,"" I said, taking a drink of my coffee. I wanted to yell again. That anger that lived in my stomach awoke from its hibernation. I swallowed down harsh words, feeling them slide down my throat like molasses. ""Fine, Eve. I am proud of you. When do you start?""

""Today.""

The suddenness of the timeframe almost made me vomit up those angry words. I swallowed them again. 

""Well, congrats, dear,"" I said slowly, rising to my feet. ""It's time for me to head to the office. Let me know how your first day goes."" I grabbed my things and made my way out the door.

As I went through the day at work, I felt the anger continue to stir inside me. My mind would be assaulted by questions about the new normal. Thoughts about the house’s tidiness and dinner preparation danced heavy dances all day, making it impossible to focus on work. As hours ticked by on the clock, I found myself accomplishing little. 

As I made my way home, I dreaded entering an empty house. As I arrived, I put the key in the lock and opened the door. There was no smell of dinner when I entered my home. No call from my wife hit my ears. There was nothing. I felt my heart sink just a little.

My wife returned home with a different energy that night. Normally, she was a low ember, like a campfire just before bed. Now, she was an inferno blazing with confidence. She approached me, a smile on her face, and embraced me.

""Today was amazing, honey!"" She exclaimed, and kissed me on the cheek. I held her back, yet I felt my anger stir in its slumber once again.

""What happened today?"" I asked, pulling back from the hug.

""Everyone was incredibly friendly!"" My wife exclaimed, taking a seat at the table. ""They showed me how all the medicine was organized. They walked me through the filing system for prescription orders. I even helped one woman get her doctor to change her medication! The pills would have interacted poorly. My boss said that I am a natural at the job!""

""That's great,"" I said, trying to keep my voice calm. With every word she said, the anger stirred heavier. ""I am glad it went so well.""

""It did! Thank you for supporting me on this."" My wife said again, with a smile.

""Yeah."" I said, rising from the table. I made my way to the fridge, and grabbed a beer. ""So, tell me more.""

As my wife continued to run through the events of the day, and all her new coworkers, my focus began to drift. A low hum started to rise in my ears, swallowing her words like a snake swallows its prey. I took a drink from my beer. I heard the hum begin to die down.

""So, what's for dinner?"" I asked.

""Oh."" My wife shifted nervously. ""I am sorry, honey. I was so focused on work, I forgot to plan dinner.""

The anger inside me opened one of its eyes.

""I see,"" I muttered. I took another drink, hoping to lull the anger back to sleep. ""Well, it's still early. You can still get it planned out. A late dinner isn't the worst thing in the world.""

""Honey, I am really tired,"" my wife whined. ""I forgot how exhausting working a full day is. Maybe we should just order out.""

I squeezed the beer bottle in my hands. We never ordered food from restaurants anymore. I preferred eating my food.

""That's fine,"" I said, as I downed the rest of the bottle. ""I have work to do. Order whatever you like."" I made my way to the stairs.

""Honey, I am sorry,"" my wife muttered behind me. I ascended the stairs, and entered my study. I didn't leave the room for the rest of the evening. When the food, some Chinese takeout, arrived, my wife brought it to the study.

""Honey,"" she said, placing the food on my desk. ""Are you upset with me?""

""No,"" I said, never looking up from my paperwork.

""Are you sure?"" My wife asked, placing a hand on my shoulder. ""You seem off.""

""I am not mad at you,"" I replied, trying to keep my tone as even as possible. ""Now, I need to get back to work.""

""Of course, honey,"" my wife said, shifting nervously before leaving the room. I never touched the food. I finished my paperwork, and as evening rolled over into the dark of night, I went to bed hungry.

That night, I had the first dream.

My wife and I were in a normal, American home in the 1950s. As my wife worked in the kitchen, her bright green dress flowing with every step, I sat on the couch, watching a news report about the ""Red Scare."" 

""Honey,"" my wife called from the kitchen. ""How would you feel about having another kid?""

I looked over, and finally took in the situation. On the counter was a family picture showing two boys. Yet, the house was silent. 

""I don't know about that,"" I said, turning back to the television. From the kitchen, I could hear the hiss of a kettle. 

""It's just so empty without them,"" my wife said, grabbing the picture. ""There isn't much to do around here.""

""We are too old to raise a newborn,"" I said. The hissing kept blaring, sounding like a serpent. ""Are you going to grab the kettle?""

""Sorry, honey,"" my wife said, removing the kettle. She went back to cutting apples. ""I just think having another kid will help us move on.""

""I don't think so,"" I said, flipping to another news station. ""A new child might get in the way of your work."" From the kitchen, I heard the hissing again.

""It won't,"" my wife said, cutting the fruit slightly more forceful. ""Please, honey."" The hissing got louder.

""I thought you moved the kettle.""

""I did, honey,"" my wife said. The hissing got louder.

""Why is it still hissing?""

""It isn't.""

I looked up, and stared into the kitchen. The hissing continued to echo in my ears.

""I can hear it."" I felt a vein begin to pulse over my temple. 

""Honey, it isn't."" My wife picked up the kettle, showing no steam coming from the spout.

I felt my stomach spin into itself. Even looking at the dormant kettle, I could still hear the hissing like a python in my head. I tried to shake the hissing away. 

""Right, sorry,"" I said, rising to my feet. I made my way into the kitchen. ""Maybe we can try for another kid. If that's what you want."" The hissing continued.

""Really?"" My wife exclaimed. ""Oh, thank you honey!"" She hugged me, her head squeezing tightly against my chest. I could smell lavender in her hair. Yet, that hissing continued to assault my brain.

Time seemed to slow, and all I could hear was the hissing. It seemed to replace the air, filling the room in its entirety. My eyes shifted to the knife by the sliced up apple. As seconds ticked on, the hissing crescendoed into a roaring thunder. My hand leapt for the knife.

And I woke up.

Over the next year, my perfect life continued to get disrupted. My wife started coming home late, and we had to order out food more often. Whenever we did, I never ate. I felt my energy drain.

Every night, the dreams persisted. Every dream was a different time period. One night we would be in the 1930s. Another, we would be in the 1860s. In another, we would be in ancient Greece. But the events would always be the same. My wife would be in the act of preparing a fruit dish. She and I would start discussing having another child. There would be a loud hissing. And I would kill her. Every night, the same things happened over and over.

When I would see my wife during the day, and that anger would awaken in my stomach, I would see flashes of the dreams. I would see the blade in her back. I would smell the iron of her blood. And every time, I had to walk away. 

Then, the day came where I found her letter. My wife was gone. My perfect life was officially ruined.

After my months of grieving, I finally got myself out of bed. I made my way to my study and opened my email. I was still hoping beyond hope that my wife had contacted me. Instead, I found an email from my boss, letting me know that I had been let go. 

I ignored it. Surely, once I found my wife, I would be able to rebuild this perfect life I had. I went to my wife's Facebook page, and noticed I was still her friend, and that she had no updates since she had left.

I figured the best place to start my search would be the job my wife loved so much. I made my way to the local pharmacy, Leisure Pharmacy. It was a simple mom and pop shop that was rising in popularity. As I entered the building, I took note of the simple nature of the store's shelves\[?\]. To my surprise, the store was rather empty, with only one elderly woman at the counter. Behind the counter, in a white trench coat, was the man I could only assume was Michael, my wife's boss.

As the woman finished grabbing her medication and left, I approached the counter. The man behind the counter seemed to stare at me with judgemental disdain. His sandy blonde hair was up in a man bun, which only helped to feed the anger that hungered in my stomach. I stared into his yellow-green eyes and felt a tinge of familiarity.

""Hello sir,"" the man said, ""how may I help you?"" I looked at the man's name tag, and confirmed my suspicions.

""Michael, right?"" I asked, gesturing to his name tag. ""My name is Adam Abraham. I am here looking for my wife.""

""Ah, you are Eve's husband, yes?"" Michael said, raising an eyebrow. ""I haven't seen her in about half a year. It's a shame, really. She was a good employee."" 

""That's about when I lost her too,"" I said under my breath, looking down.

""Weird,"" Michael said, staring down at me. ""Why haven't you looked for her sooner, friend?""

I glared back up at the man. I mean, how dare he judge me? He had no idea what I was going through. The anger clawed its way through me.

""Watch yourself,"" I said, trying to keep my voice calm. ""You don't know a thing about me.""

""You are right, sir,"" Michael said, giving me a sarcastic smirk. ""My apologies.""

""Did she say anything before she disappeared?"" I asked, shoving the anger back down. ""I know she felt at home here.""

""Nothing I can think of,"" Michael said, looking away. I watched as he began to fidget with his finger nail. Inside, I knew he was lying. 

""Please, sir,"" I said through grinding teeth, ""I need to find my wife.""

""Sorry, sir. I can't help you,"" Michael said, shrugging his shoulders. ""I wish you the best of luck.""

Turning in anger, I squeezed my fists. Deep down, I knew that Michael knew something. As I walked away, I heard his voice call after me.

""God bless you, sir. God bless you.""

With every step I took leaving the building, I felt his words wake up my anger once again, and stir it through my body. As I stepped outside, I could no longer contain the anger. Turning, I punched the brick wall. I felt the bones in my hand shatter, and let out a scream of pain.

After an expensive trip to the hospital, I went home to rest. Days turned to weeks, and my search continued to be fruitless. 

One day, after my hand had nearly completely healed, I found myself getting ready to search through the town. As I went to grab my car keys, I noticed her car keys hanging up next to mine. My head began to ache, and a subtle hiss filled my brain. I wasn't sure how I hadn't noticed them before. I looked outside, and noticed her van parked next to my car. I was certain just an hour ago her van was gone. I made my way back through the house, just ensuring that my wife hadn't returned home. Instead of my wife, all I found was loneliness. 

I made my way out the door, and began to search through the town. I asked every person I came across, and none could give me any answers. As I searched, I eventually came across my wife's best friend, Lilith. 

""Lilly!"" I called out to her. I watched as she accelerated her pace. ""Lilly! Wait!"" I called out to her again, speeding up. As I got closer, she finally stopped and turned. Her link??, curly brown hair sat loosely over her face, and despite her lipsticked smile, I could see fear in her purple-blue eyes.

""Adam, hi!"" Lilith forced out a cheerful tone. ""I didn't know it was you.""

I knew it was a lie. I could hear it in her voice. I could see it in her eyes.

""I am sorry to bug you, Lilly,"" I said, trying to force my own friendly tone. ""I was just wondering if you heard from my wife.""

""Eve.""

""I’m sorry?"" I said, scowling at her.

""Her name is Eve, Adam."" Lilith said, glaring at me. ""And why are you looking for her?""

I glared back at her.

""She disappeared, Lilith,"" I said, making my tone even. ""I am just trying to make sure she is ok.""

""Is that what you are doing?"" Lilith asked, taking a step towards me.

""Of course,"" I said, taking a step back. ""Have you seen her anywhere?""

""You really don't remember, do you Adam?"" Lilith cocked her eyebrow.

""What are you talking about?""

""She was scared of you."" Lilith turned from me. ""You terrified her, Adam. And now, you are getting what's coming to you."" Lilith began to walk away.

""And what is that supposed to mean!?"" I yelled after her. Despite the anger building inside me, I couldn't approach her.

""You will see, Adam,"" she said, without turning around. ""And when you do, may God have mercy on your soul."" I watched as Lilith disappeared into the crowd.

As weeks continued to turn into months, I would continue to find no answers. Eventually, the answers would swarm my psyche in one fell swoop. 

It was about last week when the answers started to come to me. After another day of failed searches, I was in my study, going through my emails one last time. Suddenly, I heard a vibration from my desk drawer. I opened the drawer, and my eyes went wide.

There, buzzing in the drawer, was my wife's phone. 

I had opened that drawer every day since she went missing, and never once saw that phone. I watched the phone dance along the wooden floor of the drawer. My heart began to pound loudly in my ears. I felt the blood rush to my heart and that vein over my temple pulse. My stomach twisted knots around itself. 

As the phone stopped vibrating, I removed it from the drawer. I stared at the cracked screen of the phone, and confusion rose in my mind. My wife always protected her phone. I had never seen her drop it once. So I wasn't sure where the cracks came from. 

As I stared at the blank, black screen of the phone, it suddenly lit up. Appearing across the screen was a text notification from Lilith. I opened the message, and my heart sank.

""Do you remember now?""

A wave of vertigo suddenly swarmed my head. I dropped the phone onto the desk, as my vision blurred. Throwing myself from the chair, I ended up on all fours, ejecting the contents of my stomach onto the wooden floor of my study. Unable to focus, I crawled through the puddle, and ended up in my bed. As the assault of vertigo bested me, I entered the realm of slumber.

That night, I had the final dream.

My wife and I were in a desert, just off an oasis. I stood outside the house, staring at a gigantic garden just off the horizon. Behind me, my wife scrubbed away at a crimson spot in the sand, a reminder of the boy's sin. No matter how much she scrubbed, the stain never dulled. This was our daily routine over the last few hundred years. I wasn't sure how long it had been since the boy had been exiled. But I knew the pain he felt. It was the same pain I swallowed every day.

I hated that garden. Once, it was my domain. I named everything there. I was their master. It was all mine: the beasts, the plants, and my wife. All belonged to me. All except that tree in the middle of the garden.

Until she ruined it for us.

""This is your fault,"" I muttered, staring at my former kingdom.

""What?"" My wife stopped scrubbing and turned to me.

""I said, this is your fault!"" I yelled at her, turning from the garden. I glared at her, my eyes burning like the sun. I did have My Father's anger, after all.

""It was that serpent..."" My wife began to argue back.

""You chose to eat the fruit!"" I screamed at her. ""You listened to him!""

""You chose to eat the fruit too!"" She screamed back at me, rising to her feet. ""You are just as guilty as I am!""

""For you!"" I took another step. ""I was just supposed to let you face His judgement alone!? I did it to protect you!""

""So much for protection!"" She screamed back. ""Look where we are! You could have bargained! You could have done more!""

""Watch yourself,"" I said, standing over her. I felt my blade, the one gifted to me by My Father, bouncing against my leg. ""You came from me. You belong to me.""

Eve stared into my eyes, a deep loathing glowing with black light in her pupils. She leaned as close as she could to my face.

""I belong to no one.""

I watched as she pushed past me, and made her way to the door. I turned back to stare at the garden, the home I had lost. I felt anger stir in me once again.

And then I heard a crunch behind me. A crunch so loud, it awoke the anger fully.

I turned back to where Eve was walking back to the home, and I saw it. There, in her hand, glistening in the light of the desert sun, was the fruit from that accursed tree. The fruit we were forbidden from eating. The fruit that caused our exile.

From the sand, I heard a stoccato\[?\] hissing, a mocking rhythm of laughter. 

""Why do you have that?"" I asked, the anger filling my chest 

Eve ignored me. 

""Don't you ignore me,"" I growled. The anger filled my arms and legs.

Still, silence. Only the mocking hiss from the sand responded.

""You insolent woman!"" I yelled, feeling the anger finally consume me. ""You are mine! I may have lost the beasts! I may have lost the garden! I may have lost our sons! But you still belong to me!"" I screamed.

""Nothing belongs to you anymore, Adam,"" Eve said without turning around. ""Not even me.""

Anger controlled me like a puppet. Jutting forward, I unsheathed my blade, and rushed towards the woman who had forsaken me. I ran my blade through her back, right where her heart was. She destroyed my heart, so I destroyed hers.

As the sun grazed across the sky, I stabbed into her. I lost count how many times. But, by the time I was done, the sky had turned black, and the golden desert sands turned crimson.

Then, I cried. For the first time in my nearly 1000 years of life, I cried.

And the hissing never stopped.

I felt a stab of pain in my leg, and looked down. There, laughing in its hissing voice, was that serpent. The one who tricked my wife. 

""I wasss not the only one who wasss cursssed."" It laughed. ""You two will alwaysss be doomed to kill each other. My final gift to the Father'sss favorite creationsss.""

As I blacked out in the sand, I awoke the next morning. 

In an instant, all the memories came back. I had come home from work, and discovered the letter. Hissing erupted in my ears. I listened upstairs, and heard my wife packing up her things. Filled with my oldest companion??, I made my way up the stairs.

My wife explained to me that she was leaving. She was afraid of me. She said she too started having the same dreams, and in every one, she died. She knew it was a matter of time before I killed her. She pushed past me, and descended the stairs. 

As I chased after her, we continued to argue. The entire time, she never stopped texting on her damned Apple phone. Our argument made its way into the kitchen, where the anger exploded out of me. Once again, I grabbed the knife, and ended her life.

I buried her body in the same spot where my son died.

Even now, as I type this, I can hear the hissing again. I can't help but to laugh at the irony. The first family, cast from the garden, meant to be an example, is the most broken of all. 

To any reading this, you may be wondering why I am confessing to my sins in this post. But this post is not for you.

It's for me. At least, the me that is yet to be.

To me, who is reading this in the future, heed my warning. The curse will continue, yet I believe you can break it.

I truly do love her, in my own way. I regret all the times I hurt her.

So heed my warning. It will happen to you too. You must find a way to break the cycle. You must free us from this curse.

Eve, I am sorry for what I did. I am sorry for failing to protect you. I hope, in the next life, you can forgive me.

Able, I am sorry I was too harsh on you. I couldn't even call you by your real name. I hope your life is longer in the next cycle.

Kane, I should not have blamed you. You listened to me, and your brother suffered. I won't send you away again.

And to My Father, I will never forgive you for the curse you have placed upon us. Maybe in a future life, but know this: I die with hatred in my heart towards you.

Now, I must go. An old friend is waiting for me.",2,1768285941.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1qbk3sy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qbk3sy/my_exboyfriend_is_moving_away_in_6_months_he/,"My (ex)boyfriend is moving away in 6 months, he broke up with me last week because of this. I love him.","Maybe this is foolish and young but S and I have been dating for 2 months, we're seniors in high school and I fell in love with him quickly. We met at a camp out hallo-weekend and it all started with us laying in the desert and looking at the stars. We went on our first date a week later and then I was with him 3-4 days a week. We would go to get late-night ice cream and pizza, you name it and then head to the park for some night time games and quite literally fall to our knees with laughter. And then of course lie in the field and pretend we were just there to look at the stars again. He changed my perspective on at least 3 incredibly important relationships to me and really dispelled any shame I had around getting to enjoy my life. He made me a better person and for that I am so grateful.  He's had a rough life and lacked a lot of stability as a kid and my goal was to not hurt for him. I would pray for it often despite me not being the religious type. Even now his dad lives half way across the world and that's where he's moving next fall for college. 

In our relationship we never really got to the I love you stage it slipped out a few times from both of us. I said it-probably too early- watching a movie and he said ""I love you more"" he made jokes about getting a tattoo saying ""I love (my name)"" and I was freaking out over something with my dad and he held my by the shoulders and said you've got this and that (i can't totally remember) and a boyfriend who loves you very much. Still, anytime I brought up the future he had a strong reaction ""ohh god not that I can't talk about that right now"". And then it was the night we broke up I was incredibly anxious for the past two days and thought maybe I was going crazy but no, he started to think about the realities of relationship. 

  
Arriving at my house he texted ""here"" which was unusual for him considering our normal routine was for him to come in and give my dog a bit of love while I would make us each a cup of tea to get the night started. Then the conversation began he seemed unsure about his decision and I won't lie I confessed my love to him over and over again I tried to come up with all the ways we could make it work--without promising more than I really could. But he knew the reality we would be long distance across the world on completely opposite time zone for more than a year before any decision could be made. He also told me how much he loved me and how he was falling for me. Even called me a rockstar lol. I didn't want to lose him and I let him know that he said I wouldn't and that I could always give him a call or that we could go for a coffee. 

Now we are broken up have been for a week and besides two texts the first night we are no contact. In my last text I suggested no contact but then reaching out after a week obviously I've realized im not ready for that as i cried every single day last week. So, now we get to the problem. I understand us in a relationship will not work and I'm still finding acceptance to that but can/should we still be friends. I don't know how to do that and I definitely don't just want to be friends to try and hold him in my life even though i would be wishing could still be together. We don't see each other in any common places so It would have to be an active effort for us to be friends. Is the doable after more time? Should I take my mind of being friends entirely in order for me to heal? Should I reach out or wait for him? I truly believe he loved/s me but didn't want himself to get deeper in because then he would have to go through a bigger heartbreak and he's had enough of that in his life. I Imagine us being the type of friends who check in once every few weeks but idk. 

  
TLDR; I'm a senior in high school and my boyfriend of 2month nipped our relationship in the bud even though we were ""falling in love"" because he is moving across the world next fall. I want to know if it could be a good thing for us to be friends, if I should be the one to reach out considering he dumped me, or if I should just cut my losses and not look back. We are no contanct rn and there is like zero chance of us running into reach other on accident. ",1,1768285772.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

1qbjztd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qbjztd/how_to_become_a_worldclass_dj_the_psychology/,How to Become a World-Class DJ: The PSYCHOLOGY Behind Black Coffee's Insane Journey,"So I've been deep diving into the EDM scene lately (blame Spotify algorithms), and stumbled onto Black Coffee's story. This guy lost the use of his arm in a taxi accident at 14, and went on to become one of the world's most successful DJs. Not in a ""feel-good inspirational movie"" way, but like, genuinely revolutionized house music and headlined Coachella. His story made me realize we completely misunderstand what it takes to reach mastery in creative fields.

Most people think technical skill is everything. We obsess over gear, technique, hours of practice. But that's only part of it. After going through Black Coffee's interviews, his Grammy acceptance speech, and way too many production breakdowns, I found patterns that apply to anyone trying to master a craft. These insights come from various sources including industry podcasts, masterclasses, and neuroscience research on skill acquisition.

\*\*Finding constraints that force innovation.\*\* Black Coffee's physical limitation meant he couldn't do the typical two-deck mixing style. So he developed a completely unique approach using software, loops, and live elements. The constraint became his signature. This mirrors research from Johns Hopkins on creative problem solving, showing that limitations actually enhance creativity by forcing novel solutions. Think about your own ""constraints"", whether it's time, resources, or experience. They're not roadblocks, they're the thing that will make your approach different from everyone else doing the exact same thing the same way.

\*\*Deep listening changes everything.\*\* Black Coffee talks extensively about this in his Red Bull Music Academy lecture. He spent years just listening, analyzing structure, understanding why certain transitions gave him physical reactions. Not casual listening while scrolling, but active, analytical engagement with music. This kind of deliberate practice is what Anders Ericsson's research (the 10,000 hours guy) actually refers to, not just mindless repetition. Most people practice their craft while distracted or on autopilot. The ones who break through are absorbing at a different level.

For anyone trying to level up in creative work, the book ""Peak"" by Ericsson is absolutely essential. Won the PROSE Award and Ericsson spent decades studying expert performance across fields. This book will make you question everything you think you know about talent and practice. The practical frameworks for designing effective practice sessions are insanely good. It's not just about working hard, it's about working smart with immediate feedback loops.

\*\*Building a distinct voice matters more than technical perfection.\*\* Black Coffee's Afropolitan sound, blending African rhythms with house, wasn't some calculated market move. It came from his actual life, his roots. The music industry is so oversaturated that technical competence is basically the baseline now. What separates artists is authenticity and perspective. This applies beyond music, honestly. In writing, design, any creative field. People can smell manufactured authenticity from miles away.

\*\*Strategic collaboration accelerates growth.\*\* Black Coffee didn't just work with established names, he actively sought out collaborations that pushed him into unfamiliar territory. Working with vocalists, live instrumentalists, artists from different genres. Each collaboration was essentially a masterclass. There's neuroscience backing this up too, the social learning model shows we acquire complex skills faster through observation and interaction with more skilled practitioners than through isolated practice.

If you're serious about music production or DJing, check out Syntorial. It's not some basic tutorial app, it's a systematic ear training program that teaches synthesis through interactive lessons. Thousands of electronic producers swear by it because it bridges the gap between knowing what you want to hear and actually creating it. The learning curve in electronic music is brutal because there's such a disconnect between technical knowledge and intuitive understanding. This actually builds that intuition.

Another resource worth mentioning is BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia University grads and former Google engineers. It creates personalized audio learning plans based on whatever skill you're trying to develop, whether that's music production, creative mastery, or just understanding the psychology behind peak performance. The app pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews to generate customized podcasts in your preferred style and depth. You can go from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with detailed examples. The adaptive learning plan adjusts based on your goals and progress, making it way more structured than just randomly consuming content. Pretty solid for anyone serious about deliberate practice in their craft.

\*\*Treating setbacks as data, not failure.\*\* Black Coffee has talked about bombing sets early in his career, dealing with equipment failures, facing skepticism about his abilities. But there's this pattern in how he discusses them, he extracted lessons rather than dwelling on embarrassment. Cognitive behavioral research shows this reframing is literally one of the most reliable predictors of long-term success. It's not toxic positivity, it's genuine analysis. What worked? What didn't? Why? Then adjusting.

\*\*Embracing the grind without losing joy.\*\* This is the paradox nobody talks about. Black Coffee spent years playing small clubs, refining his craft with barely any recognition. But in interviews, he describes that period with genuine fondness. He wasn't just suffering through it waiting for success. He found satisfaction in the incremental improvements, the small wins. Research on intrinsic motivation shows this is crucial. If you're only motivated by external validation or end goals, you'll burn out before reaching mastery. The ones who make it genuinely enjoy the process itself.

For understanding the psychology behind sustained creative work, ""The War of Art"" by Steven Pressfield is mandatory reading. Not his most famous book but one that working artists consistently cite as transformative. Pressfield breaks down resistance, that force that stops us from doing our most important work, with brutal honesty. Insanely good read if you've ever felt stuck or paralyzed by creative projects. The frameworks for identifying and overcoming internal sabotage are genuinely practical.

There's also this app called Endel that's worth checking out. It's AI-powered soundscapes designed for focus, created in collaboration with neuroscientists. Tons of producers and DJs use it during their creative sessions because it helps maintain flow states without the distraction of lyrical music. The personalization based on your heart rate and time of day is legitimately science backed, not just marketing.

The reality is, nobody's path to mastery looks the same. Black Coffee's specific circumstances, his physical limitation, his cultural background, his timing in the electronic music scene, all of it was unique to him. But the underlying principles, finding your constraints, developing deep perceptual skills, building authentic voice, strategic learning, reframing setbacks, sustaining intrinsic motivation, those transfer across domains.

Your limitation might not be physical. Maybe it's age, location, lack of formal training, limited resources. Whatever it is, it's potentially the exact thing that will force you to develop an approach nobody else has. The people who reach world-class levels aren't necessarily the most naturally talented or the ones with perfect circumstances. They're the ones who figured out how to transform their specific situation, including its difficulties, into their advantage.",1,1768285383.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False
