1njqtss,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepypastastories/comments/1njqtss/the_lake_house/,The Lake House!,"THE LAKE HOUSE!

My father recently passed away and left me his house in his will. His house was some sort of lakefront property out in the middle of nowhere in Wisconsin. My father bought it and moved up there after my mother passed away from cancer when I was around 20 years old. I‚Äôm 30 now and I haven‚Äôt really seen or heard from him since. The news of his passing didn‚Äôt really bother me too much because even before my mother died, he was never around. He was a cop in a small town in Texas near the New Mexico border. The town was called Starlight Falls and was located just west of Salt Flats on Highway 62. The town got its name from a meteor shower that happened about 100 years ago or so. Anyway, growing up with him, always putting the needs of the town before his family, was just how he did things. I‚Äôll never forget the day my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer and was given only a few months to live. That was the day my father decided to retire and spend every moment she had left with her. For those few months she had left, he was a good husband and father to us. But that all ended the day she died. I mean we buried her on a Wednesday, and he was gone by Saturday. No note, no goodbye, not even a trace of that man was left in that small town house.

After a few days of not knowing where he had gone, I got a random call from him saying that he was fine and he was up north. He said that he was up there doing some sort of research for something. I wasn‚Äôt sure, nor did I care at the time. He told me I could sell the house and get out of that God Forsaken town. He said that town had taken enough from us, and it was time to leave. I couldn‚Äôt agree more with that statement. There was always something going on in this town. One time there was an outbreak of plants that seemed to take over the town square. Another time a pack of wild dogs took over a farm and held the sheep hostage. But probably the big one was when the old Milton mine collapsed after some minors dug a little too deep. There was always something with this town. So, over the next few weeks I packed up what I could and had a big estate sale, the rest got put into storage. The house was eventually sold to a nice couple who just had a baby boy and were looking for a quiet place to raise him. I couldn‚Äôt help but notice how nice and fancy they were dressed. Even their car was fancy and looked state of the art. They said that they were from New York and made their wealth by buying houses and flipping them for a big profit. I asked him how I could get into something like that, and he gave me his business card and told me to contact the number at the bottom. I stayed in town until the check cleared, and the money was in my account, then I called the number and was almost given the job over the phone. All I had to do was fly up to New York and meet with them in person.

Without skipping a beat, I bought a one-way ticket to New York to start my new life. I won‚Äôt bore you with all those details but just know I turned out to be pretty good at it. So, when I got the message that my father passed and he left me the house out in Wisconsin, I jumped at the idea of flipping it to make a profit. I bought a ticket to Wisconsin, and I was on my way to my father‚Äôs house. The lake house was located just south of Butternut. After arriving in Wisconsin, I took a cab heading towards the lake house, but after a grueling 30-minute drive of nothing but open fields and not one store anywhere, the driver stopped at a mailbox that read, ‚Äú318 Emmerson‚Äù. The cab driver said that he could only take me here and that I would have to walk the rest of the way. Something about the house being owned by some crazy guy that would shoot anyone who got too close. So, I paid the fare, got my stuff, and headed down the dirt road that led to the house. I swear that had to be every bit of a 15-minute walk to the house. Nothing but trees on both sides of the road. I remember thinking as I was walking up to the front porch, ‚ÄúDamn how did he live like this all these years? This really is the middle of nowhere!‚Äù 

The house needed some major repairs, but for the most part it was big, spacious, and the inside wasn‚Äôt half bad. Granted when I opened the door, I was not prepared for what I saw. My father had the house decorated with all kinds of weird looking things. Some of which looked like it came straight out of a witch‚Äôs hut. There were brooms on the wall, books scattered everywhere, and shelves of weird looking jars that all had labels on them. You know the labels that read as follows, ‚ÄúEye of Newt, Tail of Rat, Hair of a Dog‚Äù. I knew my father was into creepy shit growing up because once a year he would take off work on Halloween. He would come by and grab me and my mom and take us out to do what he called, ‚ÄúThe Yearly Ritual‚Äù, which consisted of us sitting around the campfire with some of the other residents of the town. We would go around and talk about what scared us and after you said what you were afraid of you would throw some sort of stick into the fire. I never really understood any of that stuff growing up. I just thought my father was really into Halloween.

 Well, after taking a quick look around the place to see what all needed to be fixed, I decided to call it a night. I tried to lie down on the couch, but it proved to be rather uncomfortable, and what little sleep I did get was not very restful. But I made it to morning. After I peeled myself up off the couch, I looked around for a way to make coffee. I missed not having a coffee shop within walking distance like I had in New York that I would stop at every day on my way to the office. I cannot believe that I had become such a city boy these past 10 years. Well, I found a coffee pot and a grinder and made me some fresh coffee. I searched all over that kitchen for some cream and sugar but found nothing, which makes sense since my father always drank it straight. I was on my second cup when there was a knock at the door. I remember thinking who could be knocking on this door so, I went and looked out the peep hole. To my surprise I could not see anyone outside the door so, I turned and walked away. But there was another knock at the door. I looked out the peep hole again but again nothing. I decided to open the door and when I did, standing on the porch was a small little girl, maybe around 5 or 6. She had bluish green hair that looked wet and covered in moss, her skin was kind of pale and it shimmered in the light, and her hands and bare feet were slightly webbed. I looked down at her with my mouth slightly open. I was speechless, partly from shock and partly from fear.

‚ÄúUmm, hello?‚Äù I said, trying to hold back a scream. I mean aside from being some sort of fish girl, she was kind of cute.

She looked at me and ran and hid behind the beam that supported the roof on the porch. Noticing that she was just as scared of me as I was of her made it easier to talk to her.

‚ÄúHey, there is no need to be afraid. I am not going to hurt you.‚Äù I said, slowly walking towards with my hands out, showing that they were empty. She allowed me to get close enough for her to sniff my hand and then she just jumped into my arms, hugging me tight. ‚ÄúWoah woah you‚Äôre not going to eat me, are you?‚Äù I said, slowly trying to put her down but she just held me tighter. She let out a weird noise that kind of sounded like a giggle I guess before she let me go.

‚ÄúYou smell like him!‚Äù She said with a big tooth grin that I could now see was a row of very sharp looking teeth.

‚ÄúSmell like who?‚Äù I asked back, looking very puzzled.

‚ÄúLike Vhosk!‚Äù She said with another big smile.

‚ÄúWho is Vhosk?‚Äù  I asked not ever hearing that word or name before.

‚ÄúVyth told me that since her and Vhosk fell in love, that is where I came from. You also kind of look like him too.‚Äù She said looking me up and down while nodding.

‚ÄúWhere is Vhosk then?‚Äù I asked back. ‚ÄúI know not where he is. I have not seen him in some days.‚Äù She replied, looking like she was about to cry. Just then I heard someone call out from what seemed like across the dock where my father‚Äôs boat was tied up. ‚ÄúPenelope! Come here my love!‚Äù The voice rang out from the docks. I looked over and saw sitting on the dock was what I can only describe as an extremely gorgeous woman with bright red hair, pale white skin, and beautiful scales that outlined all the curves of her body and face. The girl looked at her and ran off towards her. The fish woman grabbed her up and pulled her close. ‚ÄúMy love what have I told you about talking to strange land men?‚Äù The woman, now clearly caressing the girl‚Äôs face, had said. ‚ÄúBut Vyth he reminds me of Vhosk!‚Äù The little girl said with excitement. The woman put her down and stood up. She started to walk towards me, and I could clearly see that she was every bit 7 feet tall. Her features, although outlined in scales, did not take away from her exceptional beauty. The way her body, even as tall as she was still swayed naturally from side to side. Her eyes, yet reptile-like, were still awe inspiring. It was almost hypnotic the way she looked and moved towards. The closer she got, the more it made my heart race. She stopped in front of me and looked down at me before reaching out her long fingers that came to a sharp point and lifted my chin. My heart almost stopped, and I couldn‚Äôt breathe. She leaned in and gave me a rather large sniff. Her breath was cold, and she felt wet. I now could tell that she and Penelope were not fish people but some sort of lizard folk.

‚ÄúPenelope, my love, you are indeed correct in your words. This land man is somehow related to your Vhosk.‚Äù She exclaimed, letting go of me and leaning back. She stared down at me, which gave me a chill. She then crossed her arms, which up until this point, I had not noticed the size of her chest. You know on account that I was terrified, but damn there was no way she could see her feet if you know what I mean. ‚ÄúYes, he stared at them like that too when we first met.‚Äù She said, kind of smirking. ‚ÄúYou do look and smell like my beloved Alan.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut Alan was the name of my fa‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Äù That was all I got out before I fainted because my legs had been locked the entire time. I woke up some time later in a dim lit room, that felt cold and damp. I looked around to find myself in what looked like a cave maybe. I could hear running water in the distance. After I got my bearings back, I made my way out of the room. I was in fact in a cave, but it was decorated to look like a house. There was art hanging on the walls of what looked like priceless paintings. There were candles everywhere that lit the entire place. The sound of the running water was a great big waterfall that separated the cave home and the great big lake that my father‚Äôs house was on. ‚ÄúAm I dreaming?‚Äù This is what kept running through my mind as I continued to explore the cave home.

The little girl appeared behind me and asked, ‚ÄúSo you are my brother?‚Äù I jumped.

‚ÄúJesus! You scared me!‚Äù I yelped, as I turned and fell over a chair that I had not noticed sitting there.

‚ÄúMy name is Penelope. What is yours my dear brother?‚Äù She asked reaching out a hand to me. ‚ÄúOh, umm Mitchell.‚Äù I said, grabbing her hand. She pulled me with no effort. ‚ÄúWell, hello oh umm Mitchell.‚Äù She said with a smile. 

‚ÄúNo just Mitchell!‚Äù 

‚ÄúOk just Mitchell.‚Äù She giggled before the sounds of something rather large came out of the water. The shadow it cast behind the waterfall gave me quite a scare. It was massive, with large wings, the sounds of its claws scrapped across the rock. It tossed a lot of fish through the waterfall before seemingly stepping through and changing to the woman I saw at the dock. ‚ÄúVyth!‚Äù Penelope yelled as she ran to her with open arms and was scooped up by the large woman. ‚ÄúVyth, this is just Mitchell!‚Äù She said looking over at me once she was in the woman‚Äôs arms. ‚ÄúWell just Mitchell, my name is Irellandie!‚Äù The woman said with a slight bow. ‚ÄúNow come we have much to talk about. Let us eat as we talk.‚Äù She said putting down Penelope and gathered up the fish.

The food smelled great and looked just as amazing. I don‚Äôt even like fish, but this looked too good to pass up. As Irellandie laid the food on the table, I could tell she had some experience in food preparation and table setting. Once the table was set and the food was placed on the table, she motioned for me and Penelope to sit down.

‚ÄúWow! This really looks amazing!‚Äù I said now realizing that I have not eaten since before I got on the plane.

‚ÄúPlease eat up! Your father taught me how to cook and prepare food for humans.‚Äù She said, picking up some fish and biting into it.

‚ÄúYeah, about my father. How did you two meet?‚Äù I asked with my mouth full of delicious fish.

‚ÄúWell, when he moved into that house on the shore, I tried to eat him.‚Äù She laughed. ‚ÄúBut he fought me off and gave me this scar.‚Äù She said pointing to a few scales that were missing on her pale arm. ‚ÄúAnd that impressed me. Impressed me so much that I instantly fell for him.‚Äù She said with a warm, genuine smile. ‚ÄúBut every time I showed up on the dock, he would run me off with a gun! Then one day he was out on his boat trying to fish so, I took the opportunity and snuck up under his boat and tipped it over. He went under and tried to swim back to shore but I was too fast for him. He tried fighting me off, but it was no use I had him in my claws. I was still in my dragon form you see.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDragon form?‚Äù I interrupted. ‚ÄúYes, I am a water dragon. I can change in between my dragon and what he calls my not so scary human form. You see he had not seen me in this form yet, so it was understandable why he was afraid of me.‚Äù She continued. ‚ÄúOnce I brought him to the shore after he passed out in my claws, he woke up to this form and had the same reaction you did when you first saw me. The eyes of lust looking up and down my body.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt help but blush at those words. ‚ÄúHe spoke of his son and his previous lover all the time. He would say that one day he would find a way to bring his family together again.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Did you say bring his family back together?‚Äù I asked, puzzled. ‚ÄúYes, he was trying to bring back your mother, your Vyth, but everything he tried just did not work. Then one day he just couldn‚Äôt go on anymore and tried to drown himself in the water. He tied a rock to his legs and jumped out of the boat. He sank to the bottom of the lake, but I just could not let him drown. So, I swam down and picked him up and put him back into his boat. He was very anger with me at first. He called me a monster and told me to never speak to him again. So, I swam away back to my cave and for almost a whole year we did not speak. All I could do was watch him drink himself away as I watched from home. It hurt my heart to see him do that to himself. Then one day I heard a gunshot, and I came out of my cave and found him lying face down in the mud, with a gun in his hand. I swam quickly over there to make sure he was alright. Luckly, he somehow missed any vital organs, but he had shot and removed part of his ear in the process. So, I picked him up and took him back to my cave and I got him cleaned up and bandaged the best I could. Well, after he came to, he looked up at me and just wrapped his arms around me and held me close. We spent a lot of time together after that and at some point, we grew so close that we confessed our new love for each other under this very waterfall. Then, soon after that we had our little here.‚Äù She finished as she got up with her empty plate and took it over to what looked like a sink.

I was in shock. I never knew any of this about my father. I didn‚Äôt even know what to say in response to her story of how they met. The thing about all of this was that I wanted to be angry at my father for being with someone else after my mother died, but her story of their life together was in fact kind of magical.

‚ÄúSo can I ask you something, Irellandie?‚Äù I asked, standing up with my own empty plate.

‚ÄúSure, my dear, what is it?‚Äù She said, taking the plate from me and began to wash it.

‚ÄúWell, how did he die?‚Äù I asked with nervousness in my voice. The question made her stop and almost drop the plate. She then gripped it tight in her hands as she spoke, ‚ÄúMy love I know not what happened to him. One day he had just vanished and then a few days later you showed up at his house. I do know this though‚Ä¶ He was always running people off this land who were looking for us.‚Äù She finally said placing the last clean plate on the rack to dry.

‚ÄúLooking for you two?‚Äù I asked now feeling confused. ‚ÄúYes, my love, we are special since we are water dragons. Our skin and meat are as you humans would say a precious commodity.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, my father was protecting you two from people that wanted to kill you?‚Äù I asked, feeling the rage swell up inside me. ‚ÄúYes, my love, your father was a good man to us.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDo you know who could have possibly killed him?‚Äù I asked, clinching my hands into tight fists. ‚ÄúWell...‚Äù She started to say but was interrupted by Penelope pulling on my shirt looking up at me before she said, ‚ÄúThe bad man that wears a dead animal as a face. He probably took Vhosk away from me and Vyth.‚Äù I could tell her eyes were getting watery and full of tears. I looked over at Irellandie and asked, ‚ÄúDo you know who she is talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúI believe she is talking about Harith. Harith is someone that wears a bull‚Äôs skull as a mask to hide what he really is. I saw his face once when he and Alan got into a fight. Alan had managed to knock off his mask revealing nothing but a white face. There was nothing there. No eyes, no nose, no mouth, just nothingness.‚Äù She said, stroking Penelope‚Äôs hair. ‚ÄúYeah, it was scary!‚Äô Penelope added. ‚ÄúHis sole purpose is to feed the insatiable hunger of his boss, Gorn the Devourer!‚Äù Irellandie said with a look of worry.

‚ÄúI am in way over my head here!‚Äù I exclaimed sitting down in the nearest chair. ‚ÄúMy love, I am sorry that you knew nothing of this world just a few days ago, and now you have found yourself in the deep end.‚Äù Irellandie spoke while placing a calming hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúI mean I am no stranger to weird things happening. I am from Starlight Falls after all, but this is more than I was bargaining for when I came here. I just came here to get my father‚Äôs house in order and then I was going to sell it.‚Äù I sighed, lowering my head down. ‚ÄúI think I need to lay down and try to wrap my head around this.‚Äù I said, getting up from the chair and heading back to the bed I woke up in. ‚ÄúSure, thing my love, you are always welcome here. You are family after all.‚Äù Irellandie stated. ‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre my big brother too.‚Äù Penelope quickly added as well. I‚Äôll admit that did make me smile just a little bit. I decided that all this craziness can wait until tomorrow, I was drained and needed sleep.

The next morning came but I was not ready for it. I did not fall asleep as quickly as I thought I was going to. It seemed like I laid there all night just thinking of everything that had happened since I came to this damn lake house, that I swear the sun was coming up before I knew it. The smell of food cooking was what got me up and out of bed. I stumbled towards the area that I thought I remembered was maybe the dining area, but it was just another room, filled with girlie stuff, and pictures drawn on the walls. I figured out that I stumbled into Penelope‚Äôs room. I managed to follow the scent and found the dining area, where both Irellandie and Penelope were already sitting. I couldn‚Äôt believe what I saw. She made pancakes, eggs, and fish for breakfast. I guess my father really did teach her how to cook. I thought as I sat down and greeted everyone at the table. I loaded my plate up with food until it couldn‚Äôt be stacked anymore. I picked up the fork and was about to dig in when from outside the cave there was a booming voice that could be heard.

‚ÄúCome on out! The boss is extra hungry today! That last meal I gave him didn‚Äôt do much. Said something about humans don‚Äôt fill him up like a good piece of dragon does.‚Äù The voice rang out.

I heard a hissing growl come Irellandie before Penelope got under the table and hid. ‚ÄúThat is the bad man.‚Äù Penelope screamed looking up at me from under the table. I froze in my seat, sweat began to run down my cheeks. What was I supposed to do? I am no fighter; I am just a real estate agent from New York. My father was the law enforcer, he was the one with the guns, not me. That is when it hit me, my father wasn‚Äôt here to save the day this time. The bad guy had won. I felt so helpless. Here was this cute little girl that I just found out was my little sister and I guess my stepmother, who now was wanted dead, and I was being a complete coward. By this time, I had not realized that Irellandie had made her way to the waterfall and was about to pass through it. I tried to get up to stop her, but the fear of the unknown took hold of me. I watched as she stepped through the waterfall and turned into her big dragon form and let out a mighty roar. Before I knew it, she had gone out of sight.

‚ÄúLEAVE MY FAMILY ALONE!‚Äù I heard a loud roar of a voice coming from outside the cave. Well, that brought me back to my senses and I jumped up and ran to the opening. I motioned for Penelope to stay under the table where it was safe. I looked outside and saw Irellandie‚Äôs giant dragon form splashing around in the water as a man wearing a large bull‚Äôs skull for a mask ran on top of the water. Their battle raged on as I stood at the waterfall, by myself, and afraid. I wanted to help but I did not know how.

‚ÄúBrother!‚Äù I heard come from behind me. ‚ÄúUse the gun on the wall. Vhosk said that if the bad man comes back use it on him.‚Äù Penelope yelled pointing to the rifle on the wall. I went over and picked up the rifle off the wall and gave it a quick inspection. It looked like an ordinary rifle but inside the chamber was what looked like some sort of bullet with some liquid inside the casing. I slid the bullet back into the chamber and locked it in place. I made my way back outside and took aim. I pulled the trigger, and the shot ran out, but it missed its mark. I was not the shooter that my father was, and it was obvious. Penelope gave me the box of bullets that was next to where the rifle had been hung on the wall. I grabbed another bullet and put it in the chamber. I took aim again, this time my I was closer, but I still missed. I grabbed another bullet and took aim; this time I managed to clip his shoulder and the man in the skull mask held it and backed off towards the shore. This gave Irellandie the opportunity to deliver a decent blow to the ghost‚Äôs body. But all that did was knock him down, it did not cause any damage though. I tried to aim for him again, but Irellandie was now in the way. She had pounced on top of him and had him pinned to the ground. The ghost tried to move but was held down by the weight of Irellandie‚Äôs talons. Just as I thought we were winning the fight I heard a pin being pulled followed by Irellandie roaring in agony as she pulled her massive, clawed foot off him. He had managed to set off a grenade under her claws, which may not have caused him any damage, it certainly hurt her. She roared as she gripped her foot as the pain made her slowly change to her more human form. I could now see that her foot which had now become her hand was bloody and badly injured. The man with the skull mask took this time to get up and run away.

‚ÄúTHIS ISN‚ÄôT OVER! I‚ÄôLL BE BACK TO GET MY REVENGE!‚Äù The man in the skull mask yelled as he ran and then disappeared right in front of us.

Without thinking, I dove into the water and swam over to her as fast as I could. Once I got to the shore, Irellandie was already making her towards the water. I watched as the water touched her mangled hand, and the bones and flesh began to heal until you could not tell that she was even hurt. ‚ÄúOh, thank God you are ok. I guess being a water dragon has its advantages.‚Äù I said, inspecting her now fully restored hand. ‚ÄúYes, my love, as long as I have access to water, I can heal.‚Äù She said, wiping off the blood from her hand. ‚ÄúBut we must prepare for the inevitable return of Harith.‚Äù She added, turning towards me. Her face was serious, and her eyes glowed a brighter blue than usual. ‚ÄúBut I haven‚Äôt got the first clue on how to fight someone like that.‚Äù I responded, looking back at her, with a seriously worried look on my face. ‚ÄúI am sure your father has already seen to that. I mean he was the one that figured out how to hurt him with those bullets.‚Äù She said, pointing to the rifle in my hand and then pointing to the house.

I spent what seemed like the longest time combing through all the stuff in my father‚Äôs house, until I came across a book of notes that was in my father‚Äôs handwriting. It detailed everything that he had found out about Irellandie, from what she was and how she heals, even how they met and fell in love. I kept reading and found the entry to the first meeting of Harith. After my father had knocked off the mask and exposed his true face, my father did everything he could to find out what he was. According to my father‚Äôs notes, Harith was a special kind of ghost called a vengeful spirit. My father went on to say that using rock salt and holy water works best in injuring them. He even diagramed how to make the ‚ÄúSpirit Killers‚Äù, which are bullets filled with rock salt and mixed with holy water. My father‚Äôs notes state that you must shoot them in the head with a ‚ÄúSpirit Killer‚Äù. According to his notes, he stated that he was working on the idea of capturing Harith in a ring of holy fire. But his notes stop after that.

I could not find anything on anyone named Gorn though, outside of his name and a drawing. It was a crude drawing of a man riding a skeleton horse that was on fire.

Luckily, my father had done all the leg work for us, everything we needed to deal with Harith was already here in the house. I followed the diagram the best I could and made some more ‚ÄúSpirit Killers‚Äù and Irellandie managed to find the holy oil that we would use to capture Harith with. So, all there was to do was wait. We didn‚Äôt have to wait very long before that bastard showed back up. But this time we were ready. I had the rifle and the bullets that I could carry in my jacket pocket. We made Penelope stay hidden as he approached the house. I got in position out of sight and waited for the signal. Irellandie was going to lure him into the circle of holy oil before setting it on fire, capturing him there and then I was going to put a bullet in damn head.

We heard the familiar sound of Harith‚Äôs steps coming up the long driveway. Irellandie stood on the porch waiting for him. With each step closer he got, the closer our plan was going into effect. ‚ÄúWell, come now. You did not have to make it so easy for me. How‚Äôs the hand feeling?‚Äù Harith spoke, stopping right outside the ring. Irellandie raised the hand that was injured and flipped him off to show that she was healed. Harith just chuckled but did not take another step towards her. Our plan really hinged on him taking that extra step. I had to think quickly. I readied the rifle; I was going to shoot him in the leg in hopes he would stumble forward into the ring. I took my aim with the rifle, but before I pulled the trigger, Harith took that step into the ring. ‚ÄúYou know whatever you have planned will never work.‚Äù Harith grinned as he kept walking towards Irellandie. ‚ÄúWe shall she about that you son of a bitch!‚Äù Irellandie roared, before tossing a lit match on the ground. The oil erupted in a blazing ring of fire. Harith fell to his knees, screaming in agonizing pain. ‚ÄúMaster, it burns! Master, it burns, please come to my aid!‚Äù Those were Harith‚Äôs final words before he collapsed to the ground, his body becoming still and lifeless. We both stood there once the fire was out, just standing over his body. ‚ÄúIs it over? Is he gone?‚Äù I said, giving Irellandie and big hug.

Our celebration was cut short as the ground around us began to shake like something large and heavy was making its way towards us. We spun around and faced the direction of the sound, but we were not prepared for what we saw. The trees in front us parted and fell over, the birds flew away in a panic. The very forest was beginning to smoke. Whatever was coming was strong enough to knock over full grown trees and set fire to everything in its path. The ground rumbled and quaked under our feet. What we saw coming out of the woods was not a tank, or anything large enough to constitute the quakes under our feet. It was a man, a man riding a horse made of bones and fire.

I had never seen anything like this ever in my life, and I am from Starlight Falls where weird stuff happens all the time, but this, a man riding a firey horse. The horse stopped and raised back on its back legs and came crashing back down, causing the ground to shake and making us lose our balance. Once the ground stopped shaking, the man slid off the back of the horse and onto his feet. The man was tall, heavily built, his hair was long, black, and flowed in the wind. His eyes were black, with yellow pupils, his skin, a dark gray, like the color of ash. His clothes consisted of a pair of dress pants, and a trench coat, that swung open exposing the muscles on top of muscles that was his chest and abs. His voice was deep and soothing as he began to speak. ‚ÄúI have heard the cries of my child, and I have come to deal with those who caused their pain.‚Äù The man stated as he began to walk towards us.

‚ÄúHe is your son?‚Äù I yelled, pointing over at the lifeless body of Harith. ‚ÄúIn a matter of speaking he is. I made him what he is today after all.‚Äù The man said looking over at the body of Harith. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean you made him?‚Äù I snapped back. ‚ÄúBoy you are already pushing my patience. Now let me have him back so I can at least make his death useful to me.‚Äù The man raised his hand out towards Harith and with a slight twitch of his wrist the body came flying over to him only stopping once Harith‚Äôs neck was in the large man‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúWhat are you going to do with him?‚Äù I asked nervously. ‚ÄúWhy they don‚Äôt call me Gorn the Devourer for nothing you know, and I am so very hungry!‚Äù The man said as he slid off the trench coat and let it hit the ground. His body began to morph and contort into something only nightmares could describe. His long hair began to flick around him and moved on its own. His hair wrapped itself around Harith‚Äôs body, holding him up as the muscles of his chest and stomach became more grotesque, resembling more of an open mouth than a stomach now. Rows of finger like teeth stretched out ready to feast on the flesh that was being dangled in front of it. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry too much. Just like with your father, I‚Äôll still be hungry enough for the rest of y‚Äôall!‚Äù His voice now demonic, and guttural, the very sound of it sent chills and dread down my spine.

I had to do something, I didn‚Äôt know if eating Harith was going to just end up making him more powerful, but I was not about to find out. I picked up the rifle and fired a shot. Surprisingly, it hit him, but it did not do anything but piss him off. With a flick off his finger, I was sent flying through the front door of the house. I laid there for a moment, trying to catch the wind that was knocked out of me. I could hear fighting from outside. Once I got back on my feet and made my way back out the door, I fell to my knees seeing a crying Penelope kneeling next to her mother‚Äôs unmoving body. I didn‚Äôt have time to think about a rational decision; I just acted in the moment. I charged full force towards Gorn using the rifle as a makeshift club. I brought down the rifle with all my might onto the back of the grotesque monster, the rifle snapped and shattered in two in my hands. He turned towards me and tossed Harith‚Äôs body to the side and again with a flick of his finger, I was sent flying again. This time I was not so lucky to go crashing through the door. I felt a sharp pain in my back before I coughed up blood, and then I looked down at the railing to the porch sticking out of my stomach. I was pinned and bleeding out bad, and all I could make out as I fought with all my might to keep conscious, was poor Penelope crying even louder. I could feel the world around me closing in, my eyesight was going dark and all I felt was the coldness of my encroaching death.

As my eyes began to close for the last time, I felt a hand being placed on my shoulder and time just seemed to stop. The pain was gone, the blood was gone, my body no longer had a hole in it, my body felt as light as a feather. In fact, I felt so light I‚Äôm pretty sure I could fly. Then the voice of the hand on my shoulder spoke, ‚ÄúSon, this is not your time. You must keep them safe. It is all on you now. Succeed where I failed.‚Äù I looked at the hand on my shoulder, then the arm, and then the chest, and finally the face. I couldn‚Äôt believe it; it was my father standing right in front of me. ‚ÄúDad is that really you?‚Äù I asked holding back the tears. ‚ÄúYes, son, it really is me.‚Äù He said, pulling me into a warm, calming hug. ‚ÄúBut Dad how am I supposed to defeat a monster like that?‚Äù I asked no longer holding anything back. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about that my son, I am sending some help.‚Äù Just then the world went dark again, but this time I opened my eyes and gasped for air. I pulled myself off the railing and fell to the ground. The hole in my stomach was already closing up and I could feel my strength returning.

‚ÄúListen here you overgrown treasure troll wanna be mother fucker, I am not done with you!‚Äù I exclaimed as I began to get to my feet, the burning rage flowing through my body. I raced towards him with every bit of strength I could muster. Gorn prepared to bat me away again but was stopped by someone grabbing his arms and holding them behind his back, leaving his chest fully exposed. I drew back my fist and plunged it deep into the gaping maw of his chest. He let out a guttural scream of pain. ‚ÄúHow could you beat me? I am Gorn the Devourer!‚Äù He said as he coughed up blood. ‚ÄúBecause I had help!‚Äù I yelled as I pulled out his heart and crushed it in front of him. His body went limp and fell to the ground. I dropped his crushed heart to the ground and looked up at the person that had helped me kill Gorn the Devourer. The man in front of me was that of angel. His body sparkled and glowed, his face was soft and kind. He just smiled and said ‚ÄúThank you for setting me free! I will no longer have to serve that demon ever again.‚Äù The man then turned and began to ascend into the very clouds, riding on the back of a Pegasus, leaving nothing behind but the skull of a large bull.

I raced over to Irellandie and got her into the lake so she could heal. Over the course of the next few days, I spent it with my new family, my little sister and my stepmother. We made two tombstones and put them out near the shore of the lake. One for my father, and one for the man that helped me save my family, Harith! May they finally rest in peace!

1njqtgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/1njqtgu/how_to_plan_for_retirement/,How to plan for retirement,"My husband and I are getting close to our FIRE number (I am 44F, he is 42M), in fact he was laid off half a year ago with great severance and mountain biking as I type this...

My concern is after I quit my job, I will lose the structure and community of working. Working downtown takes commute time, but it also gives me an opportunity to people watch on metro rides, check out new businesses, have coffee and lunch with coworkers. It's a bit scary to quit my job and suddenly be cut off from all that (I am a bit of an extrovert lol). 

My other fear is about being irrelevant. I've spent all my life building up my resume, aligning my experience and education to further my career, people at work do respect my seniority. It would be one thing to retire at an older age, but at my age (44), it's a scary thought to willingly give it all up and start from nothing again to redefine myself. After a few years, I will likely be less employable. And would I feel detached from society when I hang out with other retired people that have time to meet during the day? I would be happy to gym or take art classes when I retire, but I wonder if this sense of being irrelevant would stick. 

I think I do need to spend the last year or so to clear my head and plan this out. My question is, how do you guys plan to transition into retirement? Or was anyone hit with these feelings of detachment or complete loss of structure, and how did you adapt to them? ",2,1758146893.0,Fire,0,1.0,False

My father recently passed away and left me his house in his will. His house was some sort of lakefront property out in the middle of nowhere in Wisconsin. My father bought it and moved up there after my mother passed away from cancer when I was around 20 years old. I‚Äôm 30 now and I haven‚Äôt really seen or heard from him since. The news of his passing didn‚Äôt really bother me too much because even before my mother died, he was never around. He was a cop in a small town in Texas near the New Mexico border. The town was called Starlight Falls and was located just west of Salt Flats on Highway 62. The town got its name from a meteor shower that happened about 100 years ago or so. Anyway, growing up with him, always putting the needs of the town before his family, was just how he did things. I‚Äôll never forget the day my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer and was given only a few months to live. That was the day my father decided to retire and spend every moment she had left with her. For those few months she had left, he was a good husband and father to us. But that all ended the day she died. I mean we buried her on a Wednesday, and he was gone by Saturday. No note, no goodbye, not even a trace of that man was left in that small town house.

After a few days of not knowing where he had gone, I got a random call from him saying that he was fine and he was up north. He said that he was up there doing some sort of research for something. I wasn‚Äôt sure, nor did I care at the time. He told me I could sell the house and get out of that God Forsaken town. He said that town had taken enough from us, and it was time to leave. I couldn‚Äôt agree more with that statement. There was always something going on in this town. One time there was an outbreak of plants that seemed to take over the town square. Another time a pack of wild dogs took over a farm and held the sheep hostage. But probably the big one was when the old Milton mine collapsed after some minors dug a little too deep. There was always something with this town. So, over the next few weeks I packed up what I could and had a big estate sale, the rest got put into storage. The house was eventually sold to a nice couple who just had a baby boy and were looking for a quiet place to raise him. I couldn‚Äôt help but notice how nice and fancy they were dressed. Even their car was fancy and looked state of the art. They said that they were from New York and made their wealth by buying houses and flipping them for a big profit. I asked him how I could get into something like that, and he gave me his business card and told me to contact the number at the bottom. I stayed in town until the check cleared, and the money was in my account, then I called the number and was almost given the job over the phone. All I had to do was fly up to New York and meet with them in person.

Without skipping a beat, I bought a one-way ticket to New York to start my new life. I won‚Äôt bore you with all those details but just know I turned out to be pretty good at it. So, when I got the message that my father passed and he left me the house out in Wisconsin, I jumped at the idea of flipping it to make a profit. I bought a ticket to Wisconsin, and I was on my way to my father‚Äôs house. The lake house was located just south of Butternut. After arriving in Wisconsin, I took a cab heading towards the lake house, but after a grueling 30-minute drive of nothing but open fields and not one store anywhere, the driver stopped at a mailbox that read, ‚Äú318 Emmerson‚Äù. The cab driver said that he could only take me here and that I would have to walk the rest of the way. Something about the house being owned by some crazy guy that would shoot anyone who got too close. So, I paid the fare, got my stuff, and headed down the dirt road that led to the house. I swear that had to be every bit of a 15-minute walk to the house. Nothing but trees on both sides of the road. I remember thinking as I was walking up to the front porch, ‚ÄúDamn how did he live like this all these years? This really is the middle of nowhere!‚Äù 

The house needed some major repairs, but for the most part it was big, spacious, and the inside wasn‚Äôt half bad. Granted when I opened the door, I was not prepared for what I saw. My father had the house decorated with all kinds of weird looking things. Some of which looked like it came straight out of a witch‚Äôs hut. There were brooms on the wall, books scattered everywhere, and shelves of weird looking jars that all had labels on them. You know the labels that read as follows, ‚ÄúEye of Newt, Tail of Rat, Hair of a Dog‚Äù. I knew my father was into creepy shit growing up because once a year he would take off work on Halloween. He would come by and grab me and my mom and take us out to do what he called, ‚ÄúThe Yearly Ritual‚Äù, which consisted of us sitting around the campfire with some of the other residents of the town. We would go around and talk about what scared us and after you said what you were afraid of you would throw some sort of stick into the fire. I never really understood any of that stuff growing up. I just thought my father was really into Halloween.

 Well, after taking a quick look around the place to see what all needed to be fixed, I decided to call it a night. I tried to lie down on the couch, but it proved to be rather uncomfortable, and what little sleep I did get was not very restful. But I made it to morning. After I peeled myself up off the couch, I looked around for a way to make coffee. I missed not having a coffee shop within walking distance like I had in New York that I would stop at every day on my way to the office. I cannot believe that I had become such a city boy these past 10 years. Well, I found a coffee pot and a grinder and made me some fresh coffee. I searched all over that kitchen for some cream and sugar but found nothing, which makes sense since my father always drank it straight. I was on my second cup when there was a knock at the door. I remember thinking who could be knocking on this door so, I went and looked out the peep hole. To my surprise I could not see anyone outside the door so, I turned and walked away. But there was another knock at the door. I looked out the peep hole again but again nothing. I decided to open the door and when I did, standing on the porch was a small little girl, maybe around 5 or 6. She had bluish green hair that looked wet and covered in moss, her skin was kind of pale and it shimmered in the light, and her hands and bare feet were slightly webbed. I looked down at her with my mouth slightly open. I was speechless, partly from shock and partly from fear.

‚ÄúUmm, hello?‚Äù I said, trying to hold back a scream. I mean aside from being some sort of fish girl, she was kind of cute.

She looked at me and ran and hid behind the beam that supported the roof on the porch. Noticing that she was just as scared of me as I was of her made it easier to talk to her.

‚ÄúHey, there is no need to be afraid. I am not going to hurt you.‚Äù I said, slowly walking towards with my hands out, showing that they were empty. She allowed me to get close enough for her to sniff my hand and then she just jumped into my arms, hugging me tight. ‚ÄúWoah woah you‚Äôre not going to eat me, are you?‚Äù I said, slowly trying to put her down but she just held me tighter. She let out a weird noise that kind of sounded like a giggle I guess before she let me go.

‚ÄúYou smell like him!‚Äù She said with a big tooth grin that I could now see was a row of very sharp looking teeth.

‚ÄúSmell like who?‚Äù I asked back, looking very puzzled.

‚ÄúLike Vhosk!‚Äù She said with another big smile.

‚ÄúWho is Vhosk?‚Äù  I asked not ever hearing that word or name before.

‚ÄúVyth told me that since her and Vhosk fell in love, that is where I came from. You also kind of look like him too.‚Äù She said looking me up and down while nodding.

‚ÄúWhere is Vhosk then?‚Äù I asked back. ‚ÄúI know not where he is. I have not seen him in some days.‚Äù She replied, looking like she was about to cry. Just then I heard someone call out from what seemed like across the dock where my father‚Äôs boat was tied up. ‚ÄúPenelope! Come here my love!‚Äù The voice rang out from the docks. I looked over and saw sitting on the dock was what I can only describe as an extremely gorgeous woman with bright red hair, pale white skin, and beautiful scales that outlined all the curves of her body and face. The girl looked at her and ran off towards her. The fish woman grabbed her up and pulled her close. ‚ÄúMy love what have I told you about talking to strange land men?‚Äù The woman, now clearly caressing the girl‚Äôs face, had said. ‚ÄúBut Vyth he reminds me of Vhosk!‚Äù The little girl said with excitement. The woman put her down and stood up. She started to walk towards me, and I could clearly see that she was every bit 7 feet tall. Her features, although outlined in scales, did not take away from her exceptional beauty. The way her body, even as tall as she was still swayed naturally from side to side. Her eyes, yet reptile-like, were still awe inspiring. It was almost hypnotic the way she looked and moved towards. The closer she got, the more it made my heart race. She stopped in front of me and looked down at me before reaching out her long fingers that came to a sharp point and lifted my chin. My heart almost stopped, and I couldn‚Äôt breathe. She leaned in and gave me a rather large sniff. Her breath was cold, and she felt wet. I now could tell that she and Penelope were not fish people but some sort of lizard folk.

‚ÄúPenelope, my love, you are indeed correct in your words. This land man is somehow related to your Vhosk.‚Äù She exclaimed, letting go of me and leaning back. She stared down at me, which gave me a chill. She then crossed her arms, which up until this point, I had not noticed the size of her chest. You know on account that I was terrified, but damn there was no way she could see her feet if you know what I mean. ‚ÄúYes, he stared at them like that too when we first met.‚Äù She said, kind of smirking. ‚ÄúYou do look and smell like my beloved Alan.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut Alan was the name of my fa‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Äù That was all I got out before I fainted because my legs had been locked the entire time. I woke up some time later in a dim lit room, that felt cold and damp. I looked around to find myself in what looked like a cave maybe. I could hear running water in the distance. After I got my bearings back, I made my way out of the room. I was in fact in a cave, but it was decorated to look like a house. There was art hanging on the walls of what looked like priceless paintings. There were candles everywhere that lit the entire place. The sound of the running water was a great big waterfall that separated the cave home and the great big lake that my father‚Äôs house was on. ‚ÄúAm I dreaming?‚Äù This is what kept running through my mind as I continued to explore the cave home.

The little girl appeared behind me and asked, ‚ÄúSo you are my brother?‚Äù I jumped.

‚ÄúJesus! You scared me!‚Äù I yelped, as I turned and fell over a chair that I had not noticed sitting there.

‚ÄúMy name is Penelope. What is yours my dear brother?‚Äù She asked reaching out a hand to me. ‚ÄúOh, umm Mitchell.‚Äù I said, grabbing her hand. She pulled me with no effort. ‚ÄúWell, hello oh umm Mitchell.‚Äù She said with a smile. 

‚ÄúNo just Mitchell!‚Äù 

‚ÄúOk just Mitchell.‚Äù She giggled before the sounds of something rather large came out of the water. The shadow it cast behind the waterfall gave me quite a scare. It was massive, with large wings, the sounds of its claws scrapped across the rock. It tossed a lot of fish through the waterfall before seemingly stepping through and changing to the woman I saw at the dock. ‚ÄúVyth!‚Äù Penelope yelled as she ran to her with open arms and was scooped up by the large woman. ‚ÄúVyth, this is just Mitchell!‚Äù She said looking over at me once she was in the woman‚Äôs arms. ‚ÄúWell just Mitchell, my name is Irellandie!‚Äù The woman said with a slight bow. ‚ÄúNow come we have much to talk about. Let us eat as we talk.‚Äù She said putting down Penelope and gathered up the fish.

The food smelled great and looked just as amazing. I don‚Äôt even like fish, but this looked too good to pass up. As Irellandie laid the food on the table, I could tell she had some experience in food preparation and table setting. Once the table was set and the food was placed on the table, she motioned for me and Penelope to sit down.

‚ÄúWow! This really looks amazing!‚Äù I said now realizing that I have not eaten since before I got on the plane.

‚ÄúPlease eat up! Your father taught me how to cook and prepare food for humans.‚Äù She said, picking up some fish and biting into it.

‚ÄúYeah, about my father. How did you two meet?‚Äù I asked with my mouth full of delicious fish.

‚ÄúWell, when he moved into that house on the shore, I tried to eat him.‚Äù She laughed. ‚ÄúBut he fought me off and gave me this scar.‚Äù She said pointing to a few scales that were missing on her pale arm. ‚ÄúAnd that impressed me. Impressed me so much that I instantly fell for him.‚Äù She said with a warm, genuine smile. ‚ÄúBut every time I showed up on the dock, he would run me off with a gun! Then one day he was out on his boat trying to fish so, I took the opportunity and snuck up under his boat and tipped it over. He went under and tried to swim back to shore but I was too fast for him. He tried fighting me off, but it was no use I had him in my claws. I was still in my dragon form you see.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDragon form?‚Äù I interrupted. ‚ÄúYes, I am a water dragon. I can change in between my dragon and what he calls my not so scary human form. You see he had not seen me in this form yet, so it was understandable why he was afraid of me.‚Äù She continued. ‚ÄúOnce I brought him to the shore after he passed out in my claws, he woke up to this form and had the same reaction you did when you first saw me. The eyes of lust looking up and down my body.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt help but blush at those words. ‚ÄúHe spoke of his son and his previous lover all the time. He would say that one day he would find a way to bring his family together again.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Did you say bring his family back together?‚Äù I asked, puzzled. ‚ÄúYes, he was trying to bring back your mother, your Vyth, but everything he tried just did not work. Then one day he just couldn‚Äôt go on anymore and tried to drown himself in the water. He tied a rock to his legs and jumped out of the boat. He sank to the bottom of the lake, but I just could not let him drown. So, I swam down and picked him up and put him back into his boat. He was very anger with me at first. He called me a monster and told me to never speak to him again. So, I swam away back to my cave and for almost a whole year we did not speak. All I could do was watch him drink himself away as I watched from home. It hurt my heart to see him do that to himself. Then one day I heard a gunshot, and I came out of my cave and found him lying face down in the mud, with a gun in his hand. I swam quickly over there to make sure he was alright. Luckly, he somehow missed any vital organs, but he had shot and removed part of his ear in the process. So, I picked him up and took him back to my cave and I got him cleaned up and bandaged the best I could. Well, after he came to, he looked up at me and just wrapped his arms around me and held me close. We spent a lot of time together after that and at some point, we grew so close that we confessed our new love for each other under this very waterfall. Then, soon after that we had our little here.‚Äù She finished as she got up with her empty plate and took it over to what looked like a sink.

I was in shock. I never knew any of this about my father. I didn‚Äôt even know what to say in response to her story of how they met. The thing about all of this was that I wanted to be angry at my father for being with someone else after my mother died, but her story of their life together was in fact kind of magical.

‚ÄúSo can I ask you something, Irellandie?‚Äù I asked, standing up with my own empty plate.

‚ÄúSure, my dear, what is it?‚Äù She said, taking the plate from me and began to wash it.

‚ÄúWell, how did he die?‚Äù I asked with nervousness in my voice. The question made her stop and almost drop the plate. She then gripped it tight in her hands as she spoke, ‚ÄúMy love I know not what happened to him. One day he had just vanished and then a few days later you showed up at his house. I do know this though‚Ä¶ He was always running people off this land who were looking for us.‚Äù She finally said placing the last clean plate on the rack to dry.

‚ÄúLooking for you two?‚Äù I asked now feeling confused. ‚ÄúYes, my love, we are special since we are water dragons. Our skin and meat are as you humans would say a precious commodity.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, my father was protecting you two from people that wanted to kill you?‚Äù I asked, feeling the rage swell up inside me. ‚ÄúYes, my love, your father was a good man to us.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDo you know who could have possibly killed him?‚Äù I asked, clinching my hands into tight fists. ‚ÄúWell...‚Äù She started to say but was interrupted by Penelope pulling on my shirt looking up at me before she said, ‚ÄúThe bad man that wears a dead animal as a face. He probably took Vhosk away from me and Vyth.‚Äù I could tell her eyes were getting watery and full of tears. I looked over at Irellandie and asked, ‚ÄúDo you know who she is talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúI believe she is talking about Harith. Harith is someone that wears a bull‚Äôs skull as a mask to hide what he really is. I saw his face once when he and Alan got into a fight. Alan had managed to knock off his mask revealing nothing but a white face. There was nothing there. No eyes, no nose, no mouth, just nothingness.‚Äù She said, stroking Penelope‚Äôs hair. ‚ÄúYeah, it was scary!‚Äô Penelope added. ‚ÄúHis sole purpose is to feed the insatiable hunger of his boss, Gorn the Devourer!‚Äù Irellandie said with a look of worry.

‚ÄúI am in way over my head here!‚Äù I exclaimed sitting down in the nearest chair. ‚ÄúMy love, I am sorry that you knew nothing of this world just a few days ago, and now you have found yourself in the deep end.‚Äù Irellandie spoke while placing a calming hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúI mean I am no stranger to weird things happening. I am from Starlight Falls after all, but this is more than I was bargaining for when I came here. I just came here to get my father‚Äôs house in order and then I was going to sell it.‚Äù I sighed, lowering my head down. ‚ÄúI think I need to lay down and try to wrap my head around this.‚Äù I said, getting up from the chair and heading back to the bed I woke up in. ‚ÄúSure, thing my love, you are always welcome here. You are family after all.‚Äù Irellandie stated. ‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre my big brother too.‚Äù Penelope quickly added as well. I‚Äôll admit that did make me smile just a little bit. I decided that all this craziness can wait until tomorrow, I was drained and needed sleep.

The next morning came but I was not ready for it. I did not fall asleep as quickly as I thought I was going to. It seemed like I laid there all night just thinking of everything that had happened since I came to this damn lake house, that I swear the sun was coming up before I knew it. The smell of food cooking was what got me up and out of bed. I stumbled towards the area that I thought I remembered was maybe the dining area, but it was just another room, filled with girlie stuff, and pictures drawn on the walls. I figured out that I stumbled into Penelope‚Äôs room. I managed to follow the scent and found the dining area, where both Irellandie and Penelope were already sitting. I couldn‚Äôt believe what I saw. She made pancakes, eggs, and fish for breakfast. I guess my father really did teach her how to cook. I thought as I sat down and greeted everyone at the table. I loaded my plate up with food until it couldn‚Äôt be stacked anymore. I picked up the fork and was about to dig in when from outside the cave there was a booming voice that could be heard.

‚ÄúCome on out! The boss is extra hungry today! That last meal I gave him didn‚Äôt do much. Said something about humans don‚Äôt fill him up like a good piece of dragon does.‚Äù The voice rang out.

I heard a hissing growl come Irellandie before Penelope got under the table and hid. ‚ÄúThat is the bad man.‚Äù Penelope screamed looking up at me from under the table. I froze in my seat, sweat began to run down my cheeks. What was I supposed to do? I am no fighter; I am just a real estate agent from New York. My father was the law enforcer, he was the one with the guns, not me. That is when it hit me, my father wasn‚Äôt here to save the day this time. The bad guy had won. I felt so helpless. Here was this cute little girl that I just found out was my little sister and I guess my stepmother, who now was wanted dead, and I was being a complete coward. By this time, I had not realized that Irellandie had made her way to the waterfall and was about to pass through it. I tried to get up to stop her, but the fear of the unknown took hold of me. I watched as she stepped through the waterfall and turned into her big dragon form and let out a mighty roar. Before I knew it, she had gone out of sight.

‚ÄúLEAVE MY FAMILY ALONE!‚Äù I heard a loud roar of a voice coming from outside the cave. Well, that brought me back to my senses and I jumped up and ran to the opening. I motioned for Penelope to stay under the table where it was safe. I looked outside and saw Irellandie‚Äôs giant dragon form splashing around in the water as a man wearing a large bull‚Äôs skull for a mask ran on top of the water. Their battle raged on as I stood at the waterfall, by myself, and afraid. I wanted to help but I did not know how.

‚ÄúBrother!‚Äù I heard come from behind me. ‚ÄúUse the gun on the wall. Vhosk said that if the bad man comes back use it on him.‚Äù Penelope yelled pointing to the rifle on the wall. I went over and picked up the rifle off the wall and gave it a quick inspection. It looked like an ordinary rifle but inside the chamber was what looked like some sort of bullet with some liquid inside the casing. I slid the bullet back into the chamber and locked it in place. I made my way back outside and took aim. I pulled the trigger, and the shot ran out, but it missed its mark. I was not the shooter that my father was, and it was obvious. Penelope gave me the box of bullets that was next to where the rifle had been hung on the wall. I grabbed another bullet and put it in the chamber. I took aim again, this time my I was closer, but I still missed. I grabbed another bullet and took aim; this time I managed to clip his shoulder and the man in the skull mask held it and backed off towards the shore. This gave Irellandie the opportunity to deliver a decent blow to the ghost‚Äôs body. But all that did was knock him down, it did not cause any damage though. I tried to aim for him again, but Irellandie was now in the way. She had pounced on top of him and had him pinned to the ground. The ghost tried to move but was held down by the weight of Irellandie‚Äôs talons. Just as I thought we were winning the fight I heard a pin being pulled followed by Irellandie roaring in agony as she pulled her massive, clawed foot off him. He had managed to set off a grenade under her claws, which may not have caused him any damage, it certainly hurt her. She roared as she gripped her foot as the pain made her slowly change to her more human form. I could now see that her foot which had now become her hand was bloody and badly injured. The man with the skull mask took this time to get up and run away.

‚ÄúTHIS ISN‚ÄôT OVER! I‚ÄôLL BE BACK TO GET MY REVENGE!‚Äù The man in the skull mask yelled as he ran and then disappeared right in front of us.

Without thinking, I dove into the water and swam over to her as fast as I could. Once I got to the shore, Irellandie was already making her towards the water. I watched as the water touched her mangled hand, and the bones and flesh began to heal until you could not tell that she was even hurt. ‚ÄúOh, thank God you are ok. I guess being a water dragon has its advantages.‚Äù I said, inspecting her now fully restored hand. ‚ÄúYes, my love, as long as I have access to water, I can heal.‚Äù She said, wiping off the blood from her hand. ‚ÄúBut we must prepare for the inevitable return of Harith.‚Äù She added, turning towards me. Her face was serious, and her eyes glowed a brighter blue than usual. ‚ÄúBut I haven‚Äôt got the first clue on how to fight someone like that.‚Äù I responded, looking back at her, with a seriously worried look on my face. ‚ÄúI am sure your father has already seen to that. I mean he was the one that figured out how to hurt him with those bullets.‚Äù She said, pointing to the rifle in my hand and then pointing to the house.

I spent what seemed like the longest time combing through all the stuff in my father‚Äôs house, until I came across a book of notes that was in my father‚Äôs handwriting. It detailed everything that he had found out about Irellandie, from what she was and how she heals, even how they met and fell in love. I kept reading and found the entry to the first meeting of Harith. After my father had knocked off the mask and exposed his true face, my father did everything he could to find out what he was. According to my father‚Äôs notes, Harith was a special kind of ghost called a vengeful spirit. My father went on to say that using rock salt and holy water works best in injuring them. He even diagramed how to make the ‚ÄúSpirit Killers‚Äù, which are bullets filled with rock salt and mixed with holy water. My father‚Äôs notes state that you must shoot them in the head with a ‚ÄúSpirit Killer‚Äù. According to his notes, he stated that he was working on the idea of capturing Harith in a ring of holy fire. But his notes stop after that.

I could not find anything on anyone named Gorn though, outside of his name and a drawing. It was a crude drawing of a man riding a skeleton horse that was on fire.

Luckily, my father had done all the leg work for us, everything we needed to deal with Harith was already here in the house. I followed the diagram the best I could and made some more ‚ÄúSpirit Killers‚Äù and Irellandie managed to find the holy oil that we would use to capture Harith with. So, all there was to do was wait. We didn‚Äôt have to wait very long before that bastard showed back up. But this time we were ready. I had the rifle and the bullets that I could carry in my jacket pocket. We made Penelope stay hidden as he approached the house. I got in position out of sight and waited for the signal. Irellandie was going to lure him into the circle of holy oil before setting it on fire, capturing him there and then I was going to put a bullet in damn head.

We heard the familiar sound of Harith‚Äôs steps coming up the long driveway. Irellandie stood on the porch waiting for him. With each step closer he got, the closer our plan was going into effect. ‚ÄúWell, come now. You did not have to make it so easy for me. How‚Äôs the hand feeling?‚Äù Harith spoke, stopping right outside the ring. Irellandie raised the hand that was injured and flipped him off to show that she was healed. Harith just chuckled but did not take another step towards her. Our plan really hinged on him taking that extra step. I had to think quickly. I readied the rifle; I was going to shoot him in the leg in hopes he would stumble forward into the ring. I took my aim with the rifle, but before I pulled the trigger, Harith took that step into the ring. ‚ÄúYou know whatever you have planned will never work.‚Äù Harith grinned as he kept walking towards Irellandie. ‚ÄúWe shall she about that you son of a bitch!‚Äù Irellandie roared, before tossing a lit match on the ground. The oil erupted in a blazing ring of fire. Harith fell to his knees, screaming in agonizing pain. ‚ÄúMaster, it burns! Master, it burns, please come to my aid!‚Äù Those were Harith‚Äôs final words before he collapsed to the ground, his body becoming still and lifeless. We both stood there once the fire was out, just standing over his body. ‚ÄúIs it over? Is he gone?‚Äù I said, giving Irellandie and big hug.

Our celebration was cut short as the ground around us began to shake like something large and heavy was making its way towards us. We spun around and faced the direction of the sound, but we were not prepared for what we saw. The trees in front us parted and fell over, the birds flew away in a panic. The very forest was beginning to smoke. Whatever was coming was strong enough to knock over full grown trees and set fire to everything in its path. The ground rumbled and quaked under our feet. What we saw coming out of the woods was not a tank, or anything large enough to constitute the quakes under our feet. It was a man, a man riding a horse made of bones and fire.

I had never seen anything like this ever in my life, and I am from Starlight Falls where weird stuff happens all the time, but this, a man riding a firey horse. The horse stopped and raised back on its back legs and came crashing back down, causing the ground to shake and making us lose our balance. Once the ground stopped shaking, the man slid off the back of the horse and onto his feet. The man was tall, heavily built, his hair was long, black, and flowed in the wind. His eyes were black, with yellow pupils, his skin, a dark gray, like the color of ash. His clothes consisted of a pair of dress pants, and a trench coat, that swung open exposing the muscles on top of muscles that was his chest and abs. His voice was deep and soothing as he began to speak. ‚ÄúI have heard the cries of my child, and I have come to deal with those who caused their pain.‚Äù The man stated as he began to walk towards us.

‚ÄúHe is your son?‚Äù I yelled, pointing over at the lifeless body of Harith. ‚ÄúIn a matter of speaking he is. I made him what he is today after all.‚Äù The man said looking over at the body of Harith. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean you made him?‚Äù I snapped back. ‚ÄúBoy you are already pushing my patience. Now let me have him back so I can at least make his death useful to me.‚Äù The man raised his hand out towards Harith and with a slight twitch of his wrist the body came flying over to him only stopping once Harith‚Äôs neck was in the large man‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúWhat are you going to do with him?‚Äù I asked nervously. ‚ÄúWhy they don‚Äôt call me Gorn the Devourer for nothing you know, and I am so very hungry!‚Äù The man said as he slid off the trench coat and let it hit the ground. His body began to morph and contort into something only nightmares could describe. His long hair began to flick around him and moved on its own. His hair wrapped itself around Harith‚Äôs body, holding him up as the muscles of his chest and stomach became more grotesque, resembling more of an open mouth than a stomach now. Rows of finger like teeth stretched out ready to feast on the flesh that was being dangled in front of it. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry too much. Just like with your father, I‚Äôll still be hungry enough for the rest of y‚Äôall!‚Äù His voice now demonic, and guttural, the very sound of it sent chills and dread down my spine.

I had to do something, I didn‚Äôt know if eating Harith was going to just end up making him more powerful, but I was not about to find out. I picked up the rifle and fired a shot. Surprisingly, it hit him, but it did not do anything but piss him off. With a flick off his finger, I was sent flying through the front door of the house. I laid there for a moment, trying to catch the wind that was knocked out of me. I could hear fighting from outside. Once I got back on my feet and made my way back out the door, I fell to my knees seeing a crying Penelope kneeling next to her mother‚Äôs unmoving body. I didn‚Äôt have time to think about a rational decision; I just acted in the moment. I charged full force towards Gorn using the rifle as a makeshift club. I brought down the rifle with all my might onto the back of the grotesque monster, the rifle snapped and shattered in two in my hands. He turned towards me and tossed Harith‚Äôs body to the side and again with a flick of his finger, I was sent flying again. This time I was not so lucky to go crashing through the door. I felt a sharp pain in my back before I coughed up blood, and then I looked down at the railing to the porch sticking out of my stomach. I was pinned and bleeding out bad, and all I could make out as I fought with all my might to keep conscious, was poor Penelope crying even louder. I could feel the world around me closing in, my eyesight was going dark and all I felt was the coldness of my encroaching death.

As my eyes began to close for the last time, I felt a hand being placed on my shoulder and time just seemed to stop. The pain was gone, the blood was gone, my body no longer had a hole in it, my body felt as light as a feather. In fact, I felt so light I‚Äôm pretty sure I could fly. Then the voice of the hand on my shoulder spoke, ‚ÄúSon, this is not your time. You must keep them safe. It is all on you now. Succeed where I failed.‚Äù I looked at the hand on my shoulder, then the arm, and then the chest, and finally the face. I couldn‚Äôt believe it; it was my father standing right in front of me. ‚ÄúDad is that really you?‚Äù I asked holding back the tears. ‚ÄúYes, son, it really is me.‚Äù He said, pulling me into a warm, calming hug. ‚ÄúBut Dad how am I supposed to defeat a monster like that?‚Äù I asked no longer holding anything back. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about that my son, I am sending some help.‚Äù Just then the world went dark again, but this time I opened my eyes and gasped for air. I pulled myself off the railing and fell to the ground. The hole in my stomach was already closing up and I could feel my strength returning.

‚ÄúListen here you overgrown treasure troll wanna be mother fucker, I am not done with you!‚Äù I exclaimed as I began to get to my feet, the burning rage flowing through my body. I raced towards him with every bit of strength I could muster. Gorn prepared to bat me away again but was stopped by someone grabbing his arms and holding them behind his back, leaving his chest fully exposed. I drew back my fist and plunged it deep into the gaping maw of his chest. He let out a guttural scream of pain. ‚ÄúHow could you beat me? I am Gorn the Devourer!‚Äù He said as he coughed up blood. ‚ÄúBecause I had help!‚Äù I yelled as I pulled out his heart and crushed it in front of him. His body went limp and fell to the ground. I dropped his crushed heart to the ground and looked up at the person that had helped me kill Gorn the Devourer. The man in front of me was that of angel. His body sparkled and glowed, his face was soft and kind. He just smiled and said ‚ÄúThank you for setting me free! I will no longer have to serve that demon ever again.‚Äù The man then turned and began to ascend into the very clouds, riding on the back of a Pegasus, leaving nothing behind but the skull of a large bull.

I raced over to Irellandie and got her into the lake so she could heal. Over the course of the next few days, I spent it with my new family, my little sister and my stepmother. We made two tombstones and put them out near the shore of the lake. One for my father, and one for the man that helped me save my family, Harith! May they finally rest in peace!

My father recently passed away and left me his house in his will. His house was some sort of lakefront property out in the middle of nowhere in Wisconsin. My father bought it and moved up there after my mother passed away from cancer when I was around 20 years old. I‚Äôm 30 now and I haven‚Äôt really seen or heard from him since. The news of his passing didn‚Äôt really bother me too much because even before my mother died, he was never around. He was a cop in a small town in Texas near the New Mexico border. The town was called Starlight Falls and was located just west of Salt Flats on Highway 62. The town got its name from a meteor shower that happened about 100 years ago or so. Anyway, growing up with him, always putting the needs of the town before his family, was just how he did things. I‚Äôll never forget the day my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer and was given only a few months to live. That was the day my father decided to retire and spend every moment she had left with her. For those few months she had left, he was a good husband and father to us. But that all ended the day she died. I mean we buried her on a Wednesday, and he was gone by Saturday. No note, no goodbye, not even a trace of that man was left in that small town house.

After a few days of not knowing where he had gone, I got a random call from him saying that he was fine and he was up north. He said that he was up there doing some sort of research for something. I wasn‚Äôt sure, nor did I care at the time. He told me I could sell the house and get out of that God Forsaken town. He said that town had taken enough from us, and it was time to leave. I couldn‚Äôt agree more with that statement. There was always something going on in this town. One time there was an outbreak of plants that seemed to take over the town square. Another time a pack of wild dogs took over a farm and held the sheep hostage. But probably the big one was when the old Milton mine collapsed after some minors dug a little too deep. There was always something with this town. So, over the next few weeks I packed up what I could and had a big estate sale, the rest got put into storage. The house was eventually sold to a nice couple who just had a baby boy and were looking for a quiet place to raise him. I couldn‚Äôt help but notice how nice and fancy they were dressed. Even their car was fancy and looked state of the art. They said that they were from New York and made their wealth by buying houses and flipping them for a big profit. I asked him how I could get into something like that, and he gave me his business card and told me to contact the number at the bottom. I stayed in town until the check cleared, and the money was in my account, then I called the number and was almost given the job over the phone. All I had to do was fly up to New York and meet with them in person.

Without skipping a beat, I bought a one-way ticket to New York to start my new life. I won‚Äôt bore you with all those details but just know I turned out to be pretty good at it. So, when I got the message that my father passed and he left me the house out in Wisconsin, I jumped at the idea of flipping it to make a profit. I bought a ticket to Wisconsin, and I was on my way to my father‚Äôs house. The lake house was located just south of Butternut. After arriving in Wisconsin, I took a cab heading towards the lake house, but after a grueling 30-minute drive of nothing but open fields and not one store anywhere, the driver stopped at a mailbox that read, ‚Äú318 Emmerson‚Äù. The cab driver said that he could only take me here and that I would have to walk the rest of the way. Something about the house being owned by some crazy guy that would shoot anyone who got too close. So, I paid the fare, got my stuff, and headed down the dirt road that led to the house. I swear that had to be every bit of a 15-minute walk to the house. Nothing but trees on both sides of the road. I remember thinking as I was walking up to the front porch, ‚ÄúDamn how did he live like this all these years? This really is the middle of nowhere!‚Äù 

The house needed some major repairs, but for the most part it was big, spacious, and the inside wasn‚Äôt half bad. Granted when I opened the door, I was not prepared for what I saw. My father had the house decorated with all kinds of weird looking things. Some of which looked like it came straight out of a witch‚Äôs hut. There were brooms on the wall, books scattered everywhere, and shelves of weird looking jars that all had labels on them. You know the labels that read as follows, ‚ÄúEye of Newt, Tail of Rat, Hair of a Dog‚Äù. I knew my father was into creepy shit growing up because once a year he would take off work on Halloween. He would come by and grab me and my mom and take us out to do what he called, ‚ÄúThe Yearly Ritual‚Äù, which consisted of us sitting around the campfire with some of the other residents of the town. We would go around and talk about what scared us and after you said what you were afraid of you would throw some sort of stick into the fire. I never really understood any of that stuff growing up. I just thought my father was really into Halloween.

 Well, after taking a quick look around the place to see what all needed to be fixed, I decided to call it a night. I tried to lie down on the couch, but it proved to be rather uncomfortable, and what little sleep I did get was not very restful. But I made it to morning. After I peeled myself up off the couch, I looked around for a way to make coffee. I missed not having a coffee shop within walking distance like I had in New York that I would stop at every day on my way to the office. I cannot believe that I had become such a city boy these past 10 years. Well, I found a coffee pot and a grinder and made me some fresh coffee. I searched all over that kitchen for some cream and sugar but found nothing, which makes sense since my father always drank it straight. I was on my second cup when there was a knock at the door. I remember thinking who could be knocking on this door so, I went and looked out the peep hole. To my surprise I could not see anyone outside the door so, I turned and walked away. But there was another knock at the door. I looked out the peep hole again but again nothing. I decided to open the door and when I did, standing on the porch was a small little girl, maybe around 5 or 6. She had bluish green hair that looked wet and covered in moss, her skin was kind of pale and it shimmered in the light, and her hands and bare feet were slightly webbed. I looked down at her with my mouth slightly open. I was speechless, partly from shock and partly from fear.

‚ÄúUmm, hello?‚Äù I said, trying to hold back a scream. I mean aside from being some sort of fish girl, she was kind of cute.

She looked at me and ran and hid behind the beam that supported the roof on the porch. Noticing that she was just as scared of me as I was of her made it easier to talk to her.

‚ÄúHey, there is no need to be afraid. I am not going to hurt you.‚Äù I said, slowly walking towards with my hands out, showing that they were empty. She allowed me to get close enough for her to sniff my hand and then she just jumped into my arms, hugging me tight. ‚ÄúWoah woah you‚Äôre not going to eat me, are you?‚Äù I said, slowly trying to put her down but she just held me tighter. She let out a weird noise that kind of sounded like a giggle I guess before she let me go.

‚ÄúYou smell like him!‚Äù She said with a big tooth grin that I could now see was a row of very sharp looking teeth.

‚ÄúSmell like who?‚Äù I asked back, looking very puzzled.

‚ÄúLike Vhosk!‚Äù She said with another big smile.

‚ÄúWho is Vhosk?‚Äù  I asked not ever hearing that word or name before.

‚ÄúVyth told me that since her and Vhosk fell in love, that is where I came from. You also kind of look like him too.‚Äù She said looking me up and down while nodding.

‚ÄúWhere is Vhosk then?‚Äù I asked back. ‚ÄúI know not where he is. I have not seen him in some days.‚Äù She replied, looking like she was about to cry. Just then I heard someone call out from what seemed like across the dock where my father‚Äôs boat was tied up. ‚ÄúPenelope! Come here my love!‚Äù The voice rang out from the docks. I looked over and saw sitting on the dock was what I can only describe as an extremely gorgeous woman with bright red hair, pale white skin, and beautiful scales that outlined all the curves of her body and face. The girl looked at her and ran off towards her. The fish woman grabbed her up and pulled her close. ‚ÄúMy love what have I told you about talking to strange land men?‚Äù The woman, now clearly caressing the girl‚Äôs face, had said. ‚ÄúBut Vyth he reminds me of Vhosk!‚Äù The little girl said with excitement. The woman put her down and stood up. She started to walk towards me, and I could clearly see that she was every bit 7 feet tall. Her features, although outlined in scales, did not take away from her exceptional beauty. The way her body, even as tall as she was still swayed naturally from side to side. Her eyes, yet reptile-like, were still awe inspiring. It was almost hypnotic the way she looked and moved towards. The closer she got, the more it made my heart race. She stopped in front of me and looked down at me before reaching out her long fingers that came to a sharp point and lifted my chin. My heart almost stopped, and I couldn‚Äôt breathe. She leaned in and gave me a rather large sniff. Her breath was cold, and she felt wet. I now could tell that she and Penelope were not fish people but some sort of lizard folk.

‚ÄúPenelope, my love, you are indeed correct in your words. This land man is somehow related to your Vhosk.‚Äù She exclaimed, letting go of me and leaning back. She stared down at me, which gave me a chill. She then crossed her arms, which up until this point, I had not noticed the size of her chest. You know on account that I was terrified, but damn there was no way she could see her feet if you know what I mean. ‚ÄúYes, he stared at them like that too when we first met.‚Äù She said, kind of smirking. ‚ÄúYou do look and smell like my beloved Alan.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut Alan was the name of my fa‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Äù That was all I got out before I fainted because my legs had been locked the entire time. I woke up some time later in a dim lit room, that felt cold and damp. I looked around to find myself in what looked like a cave maybe. I could hear running water in the distance. After I got my bearings back, I made my way out of the room. I was in fact in a cave, but it was decorated to look like a house. There was art hanging on the walls of what looked like priceless paintings. There were candles everywhere that lit the entire place. The sound of the running water was a great big waterfall that separated the cave home and the great big lake that my father‚Äôs house was on. ‚ÄúAm I dreaming?‚Äù This is what kept running through my mind as I continued to explore the cave home.

The little girl appeared behind me and asked, ‚ÄúSo you are my brother?‚Äù I jumped.

‚ÄúJesus! You scared me!‚Äù I yelped, as I turned and fell over a chair that I had not noticed sitting there.

‚ÄúMy name is Penelope. What is yours my dear brother?‚Äù She asked reaching out a hand to me. ‚ÄúOh, umm Mitchell.‚Äù I said, grabbing her hand. She pulled me with no effort. ‚ÄúWell, hello oh umm Mitchell.‚Äù She said with a smile. 

‚ÄúNo just Mitchell!‚Äù 

‚ÄúOk just Mitchell.‚Äù She giggled before the sounds of something rather large came out of the water. The shadow it cast behind the waterfall gave me quite a scare. It was massive, with large wings, the sounds of its claws scrapped across the rock. It tossed a lot of fish through the waterfall before seemingly stepping through and changing to the woman I saw at the dock. ‚ÄúVyth!‚Äù Penelope yelled as she ran to her with open arms and was scooped up by the large woman. ‚ÄúVyth, this is just Mitchell!‚Äù She said looking over at me once she was in the woman‚Äôs arms. ‚ÄúWell just Mitchell, my name is Irellandie!‚Äù The woman said with a slight bow. ‚ÄúNow come we have much to talk about. Let us eat as we talk.‚Äù She said putting down Penelope and gathered up the fish.

The food smelled great and looked just as amazing. I don‚Äôt even like fish, but this looked too good to pass up. As Irellandie laid the food on the table, I could tell she had some experience in food preparation and table setting. Once the table was set and the food was placed on the table, she motioned for me and Penelope to sit down.

‚ÄúWow! This really looks amazing!‚Äù I said now realizing that I have not eaten since before I got on the plane.

‚ÄúPlease eat up! Your father taught me how to cook and prepare food for humans.‚Äù She said, picking up some fish and biting into it.

‚ÄúYeah, about my father. How did you two meet?‚Äù I asked with my mouth full of delicious fish.

‚ÄúWell, when he moved into that house on the shore, I tried to eat him.‚Äù She laughed. ‚ÄúBut he fought me off and gave me this scar.‚Äù She said pointing to a few scales that were missing on her pale arm. ‚ÄúAnd that impressed me. Impressed me so much that I instantly fell for him.‚Äù She said with a warm, genuine smile. ‚ÄúBut every time I showed up on the dock, he would run me off with a gun! Then one day he was out on his boat trying to fish so, I took the opportunity and snuck up under his boat and tipped it over. He went under and tried to swim back to shore but I was too fast for him. He tried fighting me off, but it was no use I had him in my claws. I was still in my dragon form you see.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDragon form?‚Äù I interrupted. ‚ÄúYes, I am a water dragon. I can change in between my dragon and what he calls my not so scary human form. You see he had not seen me in this form yet, so it was understandable why he was afraid of me.‚Äù She continued. ‚ÄúOnce I brought him to the shore after he passed out in my claws, he woke up to this form and had the same reaction you did when you first saw me. The eyes of lust looking up and down my body.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt help but blush at those words. ‚ÄúHe spoke of his son and his previous lover all the time. He would say that one day he would find a way to bring his family together again.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Did you say bring his family back together?‚Äù I asked, puzzled. ‚ÄúYes, he was trying to bring back your mother, your Vyth, but everything he tried just did not work. Then one day he just couldn‚Äôt go on anymore and tried to drown himself in the water. He tied a rock to his legs and jumped out of the boat. He sank to the bottom of the lake, but I just could not let him drown. So, I swam down and picked him up and put him back into his boat. He was very anger with me at first. He called me a monster and told me to never speak to him again. So, I swam away back to my cave and for almost a whole year we did not speak. All I could do was watch him drink himself away as I watched from home. It hurt my heart to see him do that to himself. Then one day I heard a gunshot, and I came out of my cave and found him lying face down in the mud, with a gun in his hand. I swam quickly over there to make sure he was alright. Luckly, he somehow missed any vital organs, but he had shot and removed part of his ear in the process. So, I picked him up and took him back to my cave and I got him cleaned up and bandaged the best I could. Well, after he came to, he looked up at me and just wrapped his arms around me and held me close. We spent a lot of time together after that and at some point, we grew so close that we confessed our new love for each other under this very waterfall. Then, soon after that we had our little here.‚Äù She finished as she got up with her empty plate and took it over to what looked like a sink.

I was in shock. I never knew any of this about my father. I didn‚Äôt even know what to say in response to her story of how they met. The thing about all of this was that I wanted to be angry at my father for being with someone else after my mother died, but her story of their life together was in fact kind of magical.

‚ÄúSo can I ask you something, Irellandie?‚Äù I asked, standing up with my own empty plate.

‚ÄúSure, my dear, what is it?‚Äù She said, taking the plate from me and began to wash it.

‚ÄúWell, how did he die?‚Äù I asked with nervousness in my voice. The question made her stop and almost drop the plate. She then gripped it tight in her hands as she spoke, ‚ÄúMy love I know not what happened to him. One day he had just vanished and then a few days later you showed up at his house. I do know this though‚Ä¶ He was always running people off this land who were looking for us.‚Äù She finally said placing the last clean plate on the rack to dry.

‚ÄúLooking for you two?‚Äù I asked now feeling confused. ‚ÄúYes, my love, we are special since we are water dragons. Our skin and meat are as you humans would say a precious commodity.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, my father was protecting you two from people that wanted to kill you?‚Äù I asked, feeling the rage swell up inside me. ‚ÄúYes, my love, your father was a good man to us.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDo you know who could have possibly killed him?‚Äù I asked, clinching my hands into tight fists. ‚ÄúWell...‚Äù She started to say but was interrupted by Penelope pulling on my shirt looking up at me before she said, ‚ÄúThe bad man that wears a dead animal as a face. He probably took Vhosk away from me and Vyth.‚Äù I could tell her eyes were getting watery and full of tears. I looked over at Irellandie and asked, ‚ÄúDo you know who she is talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúI believe she is talking about Harith. Harith is someone that wears a bull‚Äôs skull as a mask to hide what he really is. I saw his face once when he and Alan got into a fight. Alan had managed to knock off his mask revealing nothing but a white face. There was nothing there. No eyes, no nose, no mouth, just nothingness.‚Äù She said, stroking Penelope‚Äôs hair. ‚ÄúYeah, it was scary!‚Äô Penelope added. ‚ÄúHis sole purpose is to feed the insatiable hunger of his boss, Gorn the Devourer!‚Äù Irellandie said with a look of worry.

‚ÄúI am in way over my head here!‚Äù I exclaimed sitting down in the nearest chair. ‚ÄúMy love, I am sorry that you knew nothing of this world just a few days ago, and now you have found yourself in the deep end.‚Äù Irellandie spoke while placing a calming hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúI mean I am no stranger to weird things happening. I am from Starlight Falls after all, but this is more than I was bargaining for when I came here. I just came here to get my father‚Äôs house in order and then I was going to sell it.‚Äù I sighed, lowering my head down. ‚ÄúI think I need to lay down and try to wrap my head around this.‚Äù I said, getting up from the chair and heading back to the bed I woke up in. ‚ÄúSure, thing my love, you are always welcome here. You are family after all.‚Äù Irellandie stated. ‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre my big brother too.‚Äù Penelope quickly added as well. I‚Äôll admit that did make me smile just a little bit. I decided that all this craziness can wait until tomorrow, I was drained and needed sleep.

The next morning came but I was not ready for it. I did not fall asleep as quickly as I thought I was going to. It seemed like I laid there all night just thinking of everything that had happened since I came to this damn lake house, that I swear the sun was coming up before I knew it. The smell of food cooking was what got me up and out of bed. I stumbled towards the area that I thought I remembered was maybe the dining area, but it was just another room, filled with girlie stuff, and pictures drawn on the walls. I figured out that I stumbled into Penelope‚Äôs room. I managed to follow the scent and found the dining area, where both Irellandie and Penelope were already sitting. I couldn‚Äôt believe what I saw. She made pancakes, eggs, and fish for breakfast. I guess my father really did teach her how to cook. I thought as I sat down and greeted everyone at the table. I loaded my plate up with food until it couldn‚Äôt be stacked anymore. I picked up the fork and was about to dig in when from outside the cave there was a booming voice that could be heard.

‚ÄúCome on out! The boss is extra hungry today! That last meal I gave him didn‚Äôt do much. Said something about humans don‚Äôt fill him up like a good piece of dragon does.‚Äù The voice rang out.

I heard a hissing growl come Irellandie before Penelope got under the table and hid. ‚ÄúThat is the bad man.‚Äù Penelope screamed looking up at me from under the table. I froze in my seat, sweat began to run down my cheeks. What was I supposed to do? I am no fighter; I am just a real estate agent from New York. My father was the law enforcer, he was the one with the guns, not me. That is when it hit me, my father wasn‚Äôt here to save the day this time. The bad guy had won. I felt so helpless. Here was this cute little girl that I just found out was my little sister and I guess my stepmother, who now was wanted dead, and I was being a complete coward. By this time, I had not realized that Irellandie had made her way to the waterfall and was about to pass through it. I tried to get up to stop her, but the fear of the unknown took hold of me. I watched as she stepped through the waterfall and turned into her big dragon form and let out a mighty roar. Before I knew it, she had gone out of sight.

‚ÄúLEAVE MY FAMILY ALONE!‚Äù I heard a loud roar of a voice coming from outside the cave. Well, that brought me back to my senses and I jumped up and ran to the opening. I motioned for Penelope to stay under the table where it was safe. I looked outside and saw Irellandie‚Äôs giant dragon form splashing around in the water as a man wearing a large bull‚Äôs skull for a mask ran on top of the water. Their battle raged on as I stood at the waterfall, by myself, and afraid. I wanted to help but I did not know how.

‚ÄúBrother!‚Äù I heard come from behind me. ‚ÄúUse the gun on the wall. Vhosk said that if the bad man comes back use it on him.‚Äù Penelope yelled pointing to the rifle on the wall. I went over and picked up the rifle off the wall and gave it a quick inspection. It looked like an ordinary rifle but inside the chamber was what looked like some sort of bullet with some liquid inside the casing. I slid the bullet back into the chamber and locked it in place. I made my way back outside and took aim. I pulled the trigger, and the shot ran out, but it missed its mark. I was not the shooter that my father was, and it was obvious. Penelope gave me the box of bullets that was next to where the rifle had been hung on the wall. I grabbed another bullet and put it in the chamber. I took aim again, this time my I was closer, but I still missed. I grabbed another bullet and took aim; this time I managed to clip his shoulder and the man in the skull mask held it and backed off towards the shore. This gave Irellandie the opportunity to deliver a decent blow to the ghost‚Äôs body. But all that did was knock him down, it did not cause any damage though. I tried to aim for him again, but Irellandie was now in the way. She had pounced on top of him and had him pinned to the ground. The ghost tried to move but was held down by the weight of Irellandie‚Äôs talons. Just as I thought we were winning the fight I heard a pin being pulled followed by Irellandie roaring in agony as she pulled her massive, clawed foot off him. He had managed to set off a grenade under her claws, which may not have caused him any damage, it certainly hurt her. She roared as she gripped her foot as the pain made her slowly change to her more human form. I could now see that her foot which had now become her hand was bloody and badly injured. The man with the skull mask took this time to get up and run away.

‚ÄúTHIS ISN‚ÄôT OVER! I‚ÄôLL BE BACK TO GET MY REVENGE!‚Äù The man in the skull mask yelled as he ran and then disappeared right in front of us.

Without thinking, I dove into the water and swam over to her as fast as I could. Once I got to the shore, Irellandie was already making her towards the water. I watched as the water touched her mangled hand, and the bones and flesh began to heal until you could not tell that she was even hurt. ‚ÄúOh, thank God you are ok. I guess being a water dragon has its advantages.‚Äù I said, inspecting her now fully restored hand. ‚ÄúYes, my love, as long as I have access to water, I can heal.‚Äù She said, wiping off the blood from her hand. ‚ÄúBut we must prepare for the inevitable return of Harith.‚Äù She added, turning towards me. Her face was serious, and her eyes glowed a brighter blue than usual. ‚ÄúBut I haven‚Äôt got the first clue on how to fight someone like that.‚Äù I responded, looking back at her, with a seriously worried look on my face. ‚ÄúI am sure your father has already seen to that. I mean he was the one that figured out how to hurt him with those bullets.‚Äù She said, pointing to the rifle in my hand and then pointing to the house.

I spent what seemed like the longest time combing through all the stuff in my father‚Äôs house, until I came across a book of notes that was in my father‚Äôs handwriting. It detailed everything that he had found out about Irellandie, from what she was and how she heals, even how they met and fell in love. I kept reading and found the entry to the first meeting of Harith. After my father had knocked off the mask and exposed his true face, my father did everything he could to find out what he was. According to my father‚Äôs notes, Harith was a special kind of ghost called a vengeful spirit. My father went on to say that using rock salt and holy water works best in injuring them. He even diagramed how to make the ‚ÄúSpirit Killers‚Äù, which are bullets filled with rock salt and mixed with holy water. My father‚Äôs notes state that you must shoot them in the head with a ‚ÄúSpirit Killer‚Äù. According to his notes, he stated that he was working on the idea of capturing Harith in a ring of holy fire. But his notes stop after that.

I could not find anything on anyone named Gorn though, outside of his name and a drawing. It was a crude drawing of a man riding a skeleton horse that was on fire.

Luckily, my father had done all the leg work for us, everything we needed to deal with Harith was already here in the house. I followed the diagram the best I could and made some more ‚ÄúSpirit Killers‚Äù and Irellandie managed to find the holy oil that we would use to capture Harith with. So, all there was to do was wait. We didn‚Äôt have to wait very long before that bastard showed back up. But this time we were ready. I had the rifle and the bullets that I could carry in my jacket pocket. We made Penelope stay hidden as he approached the house. I got in position out of sight and waited for the signal. Irellandie was going to lure him into the circle of holy oil before setting it on fire, capturing him there and then I was going to put a bullet in damn head.

We heard the familiar sound of Harith‚Äôs steps coming up the long driveway. Irellandie stood on the porch waiting for him. With each step closer he got, the closer our plan was going into effect. ‚ÄúWell, come now. You did not have to make it so easy for me. How‚Äôs the hand feeling?‚Äù Harith spoke, stopping right outside the ring. Irellandie raised the hand that was injured and flipped him off to show that she was healed. Harith just chuckled but did not take another step towards her. Our plan really hinged on him taking that extra step. I had to think quickly. I readied the rifle; I was going to shoot him in the leg in hopes he would stumble forward into the ring. I took my aim with the rifle, but before I pulled the trigger, Harith took that step into the ring. ‚ÄúYou know whatever you have planned will never work.‚Äù Harith grinned as he kept walking towards Irellandie. ‚ÄúWe shall she about that you son of a bitch!‚Äù Irellandie roared, before tossing a lit match on the ground. The oil erupted in a blazing ring of fire. Harith fell to his knees, screaming in agonizing pain. ‚ÄúMaster, it burns! Master, it burns, please come to my aid!‚Äù Those were Harith‚Äôs final words before he collapsed to the ground, his body becoming still and lifeless. We both stood there once the fire was out, just standing over his body. ‚ÄúIs it over? Is he gone?‚Äù I said, giving Irellandie and big hug.

Our celebration was cut short as the ground around us began to shake like something large and heavy was making its way towards us. We spun around and faced the direction of the sound, but we were not prepared for what we saw. The trees in front us parted and fell over, the birds flew away in a panic. The very forest was beginning to smoke. Whatever was coming was strong enough to knock over full grown trees and set fire to everything in its path. The ground rumbled and quaked under our feet. What we saw coming out of the woods was not a tank, or anything large enough to constitute the quakes under our feet. It was a man, a man riding a horse made of bones and fire.

I had never seen anything like this ever in my life, and I am from Starlight Falls where weird stuff happens all the time, but this, a man riding a firey horse. The horse stopped and raised back on its back legs and came crashing back down, causing the ground to shake and making us lose our balance. Once the ground stopped shaking, the man slid off the back of the horse and onto his feet. The man was tall, heavily built, his hair was long, black, and flowed in the wind. His eyes were black, with yellow pupils, his skin, a dark gray, like the color of ash. His clothes consisted of a pair of dress pants, and a trench coat, that swung open exposing the muscles on top of muscles that was his chest and abs. His voice was deep and soothing as he began to speak. ‚ÄúI have heard the cries of my child, and I have come to deal with those who caused their pain.‚Äù The man stated as he began to walk towards us.

‚ÄúHe is your son?‚Äù I yelled, pointing over at the lifeless body of Harith. ‚ÄúIn a matter of speaking he is. I made him what he is today after all.‚Äù The man said looking over at the body of Harith. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean you made him?‚Äù I snapped back. ‚ÄúBoy you are already pushing my patience. Now let me have him back so I can at least make his death useful to me.‚Äù The man raised his hand out towards Harith and with a slight twitch of his wrist the body came flying over to him only stopping once Harith‚Äôs neck was in the large man‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúWhat are you going to do with him?‚Äù I asked nervously. ‚ÄúWhy they don‚Äôt call me Gorn the Devourer for nothing you know, and I am so very hungry!‚Äù The man said as he slid off the trench coat and let it hit the ground. His body began to morph and contort into something only nightmares could describe. His long hair began to flick around him and moved on its own. His hair wrapped itself around Harith‚Äôs body, holding him up as the muscles of his chest and stomach became more grotesque, resembling more of an open mouth than a stomach now. Rows of finger like teeth stretched out ready to feast on the flesh that was being dangled in front of it. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry too much. Just like with your father, I‚Äôll still be hungry enough for the rest of y‚Äôall!‚Äù His voice now demonic, and guttural, the very sound of it sent chills and dread down my spine.

I had to do something, I didn‚Äôt know if eating Harith was going to just end up making him more powerful, but I was not about to find out. I picked up the rifle and fired a shot. Surprisingly, it hit him, but it did not do anything but piss him off. With a flick off his finger, I was sent flying through the front door of the house. I laid there for a moment, trying to catch the wind that was knocked out of me. I could hear fighting from outside. Once I got back on my feet and made my way back out the door, I fell to my knees seeing a crying Penelope kneeling next to her mother‚Äôs unmoving body. I didn‚Äôt have time to think about a rational decision; I just acted in the moment. I charged full force towards Gorn using the rifle as a makeshift club. I brought down the rifle with all my might onto the back of the grotesque monster, the rifle snapped and shattered in two in my hands. He turned towards me and tossed Harith‚Äôs body to the side and again with a flick of his finger, I was sent flying again. This time I was not so lucky to go crashing through the door. I felt a sharp pain in my back before I coughed up blood, and then I looked down at the railing to the porch sticking out of my stomach. I was pinned and bleeding out bad, and all I could make out as I fought with all my might to keep conscious, was poor Penelope crying even louder. I could feel the world around me closing in, my eyesight was going dark and all I felt was the coldness of my encroaching death.

As my eyes began to close for the last time, I felt a hand being placed on my shoulder and time just seemed to stop. The pain was gone, the blood was gone, my body no longer had a hole in it, my body felt as light as a feather. In fact, I felt so light I‚Äôm pretty sure I could fly. Then the voice of the hand on my shoulder spoke, ‚ÄúSon, this is not your time. You must keep them safe. It is all on you now. Succeed where I failed.‚Äù I looked at the hand on my shoulder, then the arm, and then the chest, and finally the face. I couldn‚Äôt believe it; it was my father standing right in front of me. ‚ÄúDad is that really you?‚Äù I asked holding back the tears. ‚ÄúYes, son, it really is me.‚Äù He said, pulling me into a warm, calming hug. ‚ÄúBut Dad how am I supposed to defeat a monster like that?‚Äù I asked no longer holding anything back. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about that my son, I am sending some help.‚Äù Just then the world went dark again, but this time I opened my eyes and gasped for air. I pulled myself off the railing and fell to the ground. The hole in my stomach was already closing up and I could feel my strength returning.

‚ÄúListen here you overgrown treasure troll wanna be mother fucker, I am not done with you!‚Äù I exclaimed as I began to get to my feet, the burning rage flowing through my body. I raced towards him with every bit of strength I could muster. Gorn prepared to bat me away again but was stopped by someone grabbing his arms and holding them behind his back, leaving his chest fully exposed. I drew back my fist and plunged it deep into the gaping maw of his chest. He let out a guttural scream of pain. ‚ÄúHow could you beat me? I am Gorn the Devourer!‚Äù He said as he coughed up blood. ‚ÄúBecause I had help!‚Äù I yelled as I pulled out his heart and crushed it in front of him. His body went limp and fell to the ground. I dropped his crushed heart to the ground and looked up at the person that had helped me kill Gorn the Devourer. The man in front of me was that of angel. His body sparkled and glowed, his face was soft and kind. He just smiled and said ‚ÄúThank you for setting me free! I will no longer have to serve that demon ever again.‚Äù The man then turned and began to ascend into the very clouds, riding on the back of a Pegasus, leaving nothing behind but the skull of a large bull.

I raced over to Irellandie and got her into the lake so she could heal. Over the course of the next few days, I spent it with my new family, my little sister and my stepmother. We made two tombstones and put them out near the shore of the lake. One for my father, and one for the man that helped me save my family, Harith! May they finally rest in peace!

Hey folks,  
I‚Äôve been tinkering with a long-form isekai/progression fantasy idea and wanted to test the waters. This is the prologue (working title still TBD).

The vibe:

* Trio of friends accidentally thrown into another world, with no legend, No hero summon. Just Wild magic doing whatever it wants to 3 mid 30's Out of shape friends. 
* Guild systems, Classes, and Guild branches shaped by ancient precursor tech.
* A world where *everyone* has limits ‚Äî except our protagonists, whose show ‚ÄúLimit Error.‚Äù
* Crunchy systems, heavy world building, progression from rock-bottom (literally level 0) into the unknown. Some notable talents and skills, that they do not know how to use.

I‚Äôd love to know:

* Does the prologue hook you?
* Do the systems intrigue or overwhelm?
* Would you keep reading?

Here‚Äôs the prologue:

  
The Prologue: Getting To Know The Situation.¬†



¬†A day like any other is what you expect right? You think to yourself, the same crap, different shovel. But that is always when things take a turn. This isn‚Äôt like that though the homies and me together again. That‚Äôs the good stuff that doesn‚Äôt come around as often as we like and that does indeed make it a special day. So on this special day we are chilling in the kitchen on a regular Monday evening. I‚Äôm cooking meat, as one does when the homies are over.¬†



Shane is making coffee because he's an addict. And cheesy mashed potatoes as he is skilled in. John is recounting a video he saw about a popular game that's coming out that he thinks we will like, we know each other pretty well and he's always got his ear to the ground for that type of thing as where i avoid that type of hype purposely and Shane while he knows typically doesn‚Äôt dish too much. He will throw out a name or type of game here and there but mostly it's in John's hands to dish the details.¬†



But it's a delicate balance, It works for us. After this conversation subsides I bring up the topic of Isekai Anime. I've been watching a lot of them lately and I‚Äôve got it in my head that I want to write one of my own. Featuring the 3 of us of course because what if 3 bros got transported to a new world instead of either 1 super powered player/entity/dude/girl or a bunch of randos expected to work together to thwart some great disaster with no real teamwork. Which I mean, each story has its charms and its in‚Äôs and out's, its unique features, its different levels of comparability to our own world.¬†



Obviously I like them enough to theorize my own version and put in the time and effort to world building right? Easily I was able to come up with possible classes for the two of them and some approximate stats, We all know Shane is Maxed out charisma stat, and Constitution stat with ambiguous other stats related to magic casting, he's always been the most knowledgeable in Tabletop games, Role Plays and Stories about magic so he was obviously the solid choice for our Caster, though with his high Tank stats it would certainly throw any for a loop in a magical Fantasy world For him to be the Mage.¬†



John on the other hand, me and him play role play games together sometimes, I‚Äôm a better talker and he‚Äôs a better stealth/risk management person so In my view, moral Implications aside he would be a solid choice for a Rogue esque character though he typically plays undead in one of our favorite replay games. So I joked that he would be our rogue Lich. He was like ‚ÄúI'd feel kinda weird being the only undead‚Äù so I got a laugh out of it regardless. He's definitely our Dexterity stat and strategy guy, though when it came to table tops, Shane was always 3 steps ahead. I often joke that he's too good at them. That leaves me to the point that I really had to figure out what i would be‚Ä¶ and as typical With a wealth of knowledge and observation for others. No idea what I would even do.¬†



While I usually play a healer/support in Video Games, that would leave the front line with much to be desired. Though Shane could tank it wouldn‚Äôt make him a very effective magic caster if like in some games spell casting could be interrupted by attacks. Though, hadn‚Äôt even thought of that till now so Who knows what the world in question might hold for us. As we were discussing what we would do in an Isekai Situation it happened and now we are here.. Where is here?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

‚ÄúFar be it for me to point out the obvious as that is usually John, well. Dycho‚Äôs Job but um. We clearly are not in my kitchen anymore.‚Äù Jordan Also known as Dante Said. ‚ÄúNo shit Sherlock‚Äù Shane Also Known as Draven¬† replied. ‚ÄúThe fuck you mean i point out the obvious? Do we seriously have time right now for cheap shot jokes, As you so eloquently point out we are not in your kitchen. So where the hell are we? How the hell did we get here? We are outside in‚Ä¶ What a forest? A cliff face? It wouldn‚Äôt kill you to take things seriously from time to time you Skank waffling Twat biscuit‚Äù Dycho said with increasing intensity till he was yelling. Dante and Draven looked at each other and then Dycho. ‚ÄúThat was a Stellar Insult, Have you been practicing or something?‚Äù Dante said with a laugh.¬†



‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm freaked out too. You know that i joke when i'm stressed out though‚Äù Dante said Draven looked around ‚ÄúWell we are outside, That's certainly something if you two sissies are done kissing could we focus a bit?‚Äù Draven said¬† Bringing the pain that only his quick wit and charisma could. Though clearly he was off put by their situation he was a champ at hiding it behind his Naturally calm persona and a bag of green. ‚Äú Let's think rationally first. A quote I can think of is: If you eliminate all things that are possible then the answer is what's left or something like that.‚Äù Dante said and took a breath.¬†



‚ÄúWhat are we gonna do, What can we do?‚Äù Dante asked and plopped down onto a nearby rock. Skillet and tongs still in hand. A shudder went down his spine, Well that was interesting though, Even though it had been Coldish outside it felt hot out. ‚ÄúDid anyone else notice that it is pretty hot?‚Äù Dycho said, calming down a bit. ‚ÄúNow that you mention it yea‚Äù Draven said pulling off his hoodie. And tying it around his waist after briefly setting down the items in his hands but picking them back up. ‚ÄúAll i can think is that i'm hungry, I feel like an anime protagonist‚Äù Dante Jokes while flipping the steaks in the skillet with the tongs.¬†



‚ÄúSeriously, we need to come up with something concrete here. In case you two hadn‚Äôt noticed Not only did our location and the weather change, the time of day changed. It was evening but it doesn‚Äôt even seem like it's noon now. I don‚Äôt think either of you appreciate the gravity of those implications‚Äù Dycho said, trying to reason with them which he should have learned by now was useless. They all had known each other a long time after all going on 14 ¬Ω¬† years in fact at the time of this writing.¬†



‚ÄúDon‚Äôt shit yourself old man, Jesus(en espanol). We get it, We are in serious trouble. There's a million thoughts racing through my head right now I can hardly even focus on what's happened let alone a solution .‚Äù Dante responded with a troubled, almost weak laugh. ‚ÄúYeah I getcha, Just. Dammit. What the hell. Are we even on earth now? Is this what your place looked like in the past or will look like in the future? Are we on another planet entirely? If so, what does that mean for my family, you know?‚Äù Dycho Said. Dante and Draven gave each other another look As if affirming in each other's minds what Dycho Must be feeling, The two of them didn‚Äôt have much of an anchor in their world after all.¬†



Dycho, on the other hand, had a family. A wife and kids, a dog Mumu and the best cat in the whole universe. Pewter.¬† Let's face it, the most important part in The minds of the others was the dog and cat. They were simple folk with simple needs.¬†

I‚Äôm building an iOS app called **Bean Stuff** to make it easier to find *actual* quality coffee shops ‚Äî the kind of places that care about the beans, the baristas, and the brew. It filters out chains and highlights third-wave, independent shops that focus on quality over convenience.

The idea came from years of traveling and constantly struggling to find good coffee. Most apps and maps don‚Äôt make it easy to tell the difference between a caramel macchiato factory and a serious pour-over spot. So I built something that does.

1njqncv,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1njqncv/how_ai_helped_create_a_roast_profile/,How AI Helped Create a Roast Profile.,"I really hope Reddit does not remove this post because, I believe it's very insightful information, and secondly I continue to get a ton on questions about it. (There are also some people who will consider this cheating, but we look at it as being innovative.)

We asked AI to create a coffee roast profile for a fruit forward coffee. (the results were quite good) This is the summary of the step taken. 

1. Explained to AI we're looking to create a roast profile to enhance the fruit flavors in our coffee.  
2. We had to explain the coffee - An Ethiopian Natural  
3. We asked AI to take in consideration the altitude and density of the beans.   
4. Worked with AI on the roast duration.   
5. Ultimately we got AI to produce a series of data points (temperatures) for duration of the roast.  
 \- We really had to work with AI to get it to understand the temperature we're going to be at the 2 minute mark of the roast. 

Then it was easier to get it give specific temperatures at intervals during the roast. 

(My background is IT, prior to coffee roasting) It still took two hours of prompting AI to get it to something I was comfortable with)

I programed it into the coffee roaster, which is electronic. The roaster was able to achieve the roast profile to a T, being within 2F of prescribed temperature at every second for the duration of the roast. 

As mentioned - I was really surprised by the difference and it really worked well. I also did tasting with customers at our Coffeeshop.

1njqjom,https://i.redd.it/tx03mk8arspf1.png,"M/37/5'10"" [127 lbs/kg to 170 lbs/kg] (2 years) - Protein, Creatine, No TRT","[Images: 130 to 170lb Natural Clean Bulk Transformation](https://imgur.com/a/3vrluhG)¬†\- NSFW \[1 boxer quad pic\]

  
Check out my Natural Bodybuilding Transformation. I put on 40lbs of muscle using intensity techniques‚Äîno PEDs, just training, consistency, progressive overload, and going ham every set.

Started as a 130lb ectomorph, discouraged after my early teen attempts flopped (couldn't get past 150). Thought natural gains were impossible, quit for 10 years. Then researched deep, restarted with stairs for that cognitive edge at first (7 days/week, 15min x3 up 25 floors, sprinting the last for dopamine boosts to crush knowledge work).

Progressed to hypertrophy: Chicken legs blown . Now at 170lbs \~9% BF, going for 180lbs 8%.

**My Intensity-Based Hypertrophy Philosophy (The Secret Sauce):**

It's not about ego-lifts or max weights‚Äîmuscle responds to stimulus: Intensity, time under tension (TUT), full ROM, and failure. As naturals, we gotta maximize protein synthesis with zero reps in reserve. Go hard every set; the last reps count most. Progressive overload is king: Log reps/weights meticulously (phone notes), fight for +1 rep or match last with timed rests (1:30-2:30min).

Tried bro splits, 7-day a week, reps in reserve‚Äîwas OK. But every other day is when i got real gains, after watching Dorian Yates speeches (up the rest and up the intensity)

Switched to every-other-day but upped the intensity (supersets, drop sets, push to failure) and crushed 40lbs gains. Most of it was put on in 24 months.

Routine: Day 1 - Chest/Back; Off; Day 3 - Arms (Shoulders/Bis/Tris); Day 4: off, Day 5 - Legs;

Alternate calves/traps for accessory muscle work at start of gym sessions., with 2 min planks for core stability

**Key Intensity Techniques (My Arsenal):**

* **LPRs (Lengthened Partial Reps):**¬†After failure, 5-20 quarter/half reps at the stretch (most anabolic spot).
* **Drop Sets:**¬†Fail, drop 10-20lbs, reps again‚Äîtotal exhaustion.
* **Supersets:**¬†with any combo, drop-sets, super sets, run-down-the-rack style drop-sets, super-sets with partial reps, etc. heavy into super sets, static holds, rest-pause super sets.
* **Rest Pauses:**¬†3-5sec breaks mid-set to hit targets rep ranges
* **Static Holds:**¬†Burn at the stretch.

**Sample Leg Day:**¬†Calves (20reps ignition set + multi-dropsets w/LPRs), 2x supersets leg extensions (36reps + 16 LPRs), leg press 2x (20reps w/drops), 6x sets hack squats x 20 reps (full ROM, duck stance for quads‚Äî""ATG"" style).

**Sample Chest/Back**: Traps supersets w/statics, 3x pull-ups (15-18 clean w/LPRs +5 each set), seated rows (1x triple dropset after 1x ignition set 20 reps), 3x deadlifts 10 rep range recent addition (takes former spot of lat prayers super set), bench 3x set (drop set), dips (super deep stretch + super swith with LPR, only 5 reps done in slow tempo, but to maximum, chest ripping stretch point).

**Nutrition & Recovery (Fuel the Beast):**  
3 p. shakes/day: Bullet blender with 1/4 cup choc milk ea, 1/3 banana, scoop oatmeal, scoop protein, scoop creatine (15g+ total/day for ATP/brain‚Äîbeyond outdated 5g). Shakes = convenient full amino profile, absorbs best. Overall: Clean-ish, high protein (6 eggs in AM, 3 yolks thrown out). Eggs + 3xShake = Base diet, then I eat selectively depending on what's available + 4x coffee per day (for focus)

I like to log my #of sets in an excel sheet. This is my ""canvas"", gives me something tangible for my work, i.e. credit. Gamifies the process, i can run metrics on it (1678 workouts completed, 14 604 sets completed \[...\]). I do count super sets and drop sets as multiple sets (hence the high set counts) i.e. Bench Press x3 dropset, each with drop set = 6 sets in my count,",1,1758146235.0,BeforeandAfter,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone! So, let‚Äôs talk about something that‚Äôs been buzzing around‚Äîfaceless growth strategies. ü§ñ I mean, why play the face game when you can keep it chill and still stack those bills, am I right?

Imagine this: You‚Äôre sitting at home in your pajamas (let‚Äôs be real, who isn‚Äôt these days?), sipping on that overpriced coffee, and making money from a side hustle that doesn‚Äôt even require you to show your face on camera. Sounds dreamy, right? 

**Here‚Äôs why you should consider ditching the spotlight:**
- **Privacy v. Popularity:** Who needs internet trolls critiquing your looks when you can just focus on the hustle? 
- **Less Pressure:** No more worrying about what to wear or saying the wrong thing on video. Just you, your ideas, and *the world* ‚ú®.
- **Scaling Without Limits:** If your content has no face, it can be anyone! You‚Äôre basically hiring a digital avatar. *Mind = Blown.*

So, how do you do this? Glad you asked! Here are some *cool strategies* to get you started:

1. **Create a Niche Blog:** Use generative AI tools to create blog posts around trending topics. Think about what people want to know and deliver that info without revealing who you are. Plus, affiliate links can turn those reads into profits! (Speaking of which, have you checked out this helpful guide? [maximize your potential here](https://www.checkout-ds24.com/redir/540531/maximizeme/) üëÄ).

2. **Use AI-Generated Graphics:** Canva or other AI-tools can help create eye-catching visuals that grab attention in social media posts. You don't need to have mad design skills to look professional. üíÖ

3. **Podcasting or Voiceovers:** If you don‚Äôt want to be on camera, use your voice! With a good mic and some editing magic, you can be the next big thing in podcasting‚Äîfaceless and fabulous. üéôÔ∏è

4. **Affiliate Marketing Without the Face:** Create content from curated lists, product reviews, or comparisons. You can produce quality content and make dough while sipping that coffee. How easy is that? ‚òïüí∏

5. **E-books or Online Courses:** Build a knowledge product that can be sold to your audience without needing personal branding. People want to learn! You just have to be the *helpful guide* behind the scenes. 

Think about it: the whole industry is shifting! Who wants to wait for algorithms to decide their fate? With these strategies, you‚Äôre going to be bossing it up, faceless but fully loaded. 

Honestly, how wild is it that we‚Äôre living in a time when we can monetize our passions and interests without even showing our faces? It feels like we‚Äôre living in a sci-fi movie, doesn‚Äôt it? 

As these methods catch on, it‚Äôs key to adopt them before they get overtaken by trends or regulations‚Äîgotta stay ahead of the game! So, what‚Äôs your go-to faceless strategy? Or maybe you‚Äôve tried something that totally flopped? Either way, I know we can learn a ton from each other! ü•≥",1,1758146024.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

Title: The Hidden Connection Between Anakin Skywalker's Past and Rey's Future in the Force

Article: In this article, we will explore an intriguing theory that connects two of the most iconic characters in the Star Wars universe - Anakin Skywalker and Rey. This theory delves into their past experiences with the Force and how it has shaped them as individuals, ultimately leading to a hidden connection between these seemingly unrelated figures.

  
Anakin Skywalker, also known as Darth Vader, was once a young boy filled with hope and dreams of becoming a Jedi Knight. He was taken in by Obi-Wan Kenobi and trained under the tutelage of Master Qui-Gon Jinn. Anakin's journey was fraught with challenges, including his struggle to control the dark side of the Force within him. Ultimately, he succumbed to this darkness, becoming Darth Vader and one of the most feared villains in galactic history.

  
Rey, on the other hand, is a scavenger from Jakku who discovers her true lineage as she embarks on an epic adventure alongside Finn and BB-8. She quickly learns that she possesses incredible power within the Force - powers that are reminiscent of those wielded by Anakin Skywalker himself. Rey's journey is one of self-discovery, as she grapples with her newfound abilities while trying to understand where they come from and why they exist.

  
The connection between these two characters lies in their shared experiences with the Force. Both Anakin and Rey have felt its power within them since childhood - a feeling that cannot be ignored or denied. This innate connection to the Force has shaped who they are today, making them uniquely qualified to wield it for good or evil.

  
Anakin's struggle with the dark side of the Force is well-documented throughout the prequel trilogy. His journey ultimately leads him down a path of destruction and despair, culminating in his transformation into Darth Vader. However, this same darkness within Anakin also gave birth to Luke Skywalker - a beacon of hope who would go on to become one of the greatest Jedi Masters in history.

  
Rey's journey is still unfolding before our eyes, but we can see parallels between her experiences and those of Anakin. Like him, she has felt the pull of the dark side within herself - a force that threatens to consume her if left unchecked. Yet, like Anakin before her, Rey also possesses an inner light that shines brighter than any darkness could ever hope to match.

  
This hidden connection between Anakin and Rey serves as a reminder of the power of the Force - how it can shape us into who we are meant to be while simultaneously threatening to destroy everything we hold dear. It is this duality within the Force that makes it such an intriguing element in the Star Wars universe, and one that will continue to captivate fans for generations to come.

  
In conclusion, the hidden connection between Anakin Skywalker's past and Rey's future in the Force serves as a powerful reminder of how our experiences with this mysterious energy can shape us into who we are meant to be. As we watch these two characters continue their journeys through the Star Wars saga, let us remember that within each of us lies the potential for greatness - or destruction - depending on which side of the Force we choose to embrace.

We're both in our late 20s, I don't really like coffee, but my girlfriend has been pretty much addicted to it since her early teenage years, probably since she was 14-15 and she has had coffee daily for maybe a decade. 



These past two years her caffeine intake had grown to kind of ridiculous levels, she switched brands to more potent coffee and was going through maybe 7-10 cups a day... It was getting kind of crazy, I didn't really pay much attention to it you know, it's her coffee, but then her anxiety levels started peaking, the insomnia became very prevalent shortly after, her bowel movements were also all over the place. It got to a point where she felt like she had to quit before it could get even worse. 



Quitting took a while, it was a process, we were keeping track of it on sunflower sober, longest one before this was 33 days, it took around 5 months of actively trying to quit caffeine to get where we're at. 



She tried cold turkey but the withdrawals were almost worse than the cons of drinking coffee so that was very short lived. 



Pounding headaches all day, not even 8 hours without a coffee would just cause her to lose all motivation, extreme irritability, depression. At the start days without coffee just made her completely bedridden and nothing could cure the headaches and anxiety other than well... another coffee... I know this post sounds a lot like complaining but I'm trying to be very objective ahahaha, I was there for her and her withdrawal self didn't bother me at all, I know that if I complained about her withdrawals it would just make her relapse again or go back to her usual caffeine doses but it was never really a problem. 



What worked better was just loweing the ammount of caffeine slowly as to the point where going one or two days without coffee wasn't completely shattering her mood and anxiety and har dopamine levels. Slowly mixing decaf with her usual coffee until we could get a couple days without coffe and no withdrawals. Soon she did a week without caffeine, then a month, and now we're here. The last relapse was just work-related, stressful week, what can you do, it happens. 



The cravings are still there, fighting them is a daily thing for sure, but the withdrawals are gone. She says she's happier without the caffeine and she looks like it too imo. Good luck to any others out there with spouses or SOs that are addicted to caffeine and are walking with them on this journey... It's a though road ahead and it gets pretty crazy sometimes but just make sure to treat your partner with affection and don't rush them or make them feel exremely guilty for relapsing, it's all a process...",7,1758145594.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

1njq8c6,https://i.redd.it/iwhjkgj2pspf1.jpeg,Wife exposes husband‚Äôs affair,"The metallic clang of surgical instruments echoed through the trauma bay as I worked alongside the team on the motorcycle accident victim. Blood pulsed from the patient's femoral artery, and I moved with practiced precision to clamp it. Across the table, my husband, Dr. Michael Chen, stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Emma Rodriguez, the newest resident in our emergency department. ""Perfect technique, Dr. Rodriguez,"" Michael's voice carried an unmistakable warmth as he guided Emma's hands. ""Just like that."" I kept my eyes fixed on my work, but I couldn't help noticing how his fingers lingered on her forearm‚Äîa touch that lasted seconds longer than necessary. The OR lights caught the gleam in Emma's eyes as she looked up at him, her smile intimate and knowing. A cold weight settled in my stomach. This wasn't merely an attending physician guiding a resident. ""Dr. Mitchell, we need another unit,"" the nurse called, breaking my trance. ""On it,"" I replied, my voice steadier than I felt. Eight years of marriage had taught me to wear a professional mask, even as I cataloged the small betrayals happening before my eyes. Michael leaned closer to Emma, murmuring something that made her laugh softly. His wedding ring caught the light as his hand brushed against her lower back‚Äîa gesture hidden from the rest of the team by their surgical gowns, but perfectly visible from my angle. ""Excellent work, everyone,"" Michael announced as we stabilized the patient. ""Especially you, Dr. Rodriguez. Your quick thinking saved this patient's leg."" I had been the one to identify the arterial bleed first, but apparently, that detail had escaped my husband's notice. Hours later, I stood under the scalding shower in the attendings' locker room, trying to wash away the day's tensions along with the antiseptic smell that clung to my skin. The water couldn't rinse away what I'd seen‚Äîthe lingering touches, the private smiles, the way Michael's eyes followed Emma when she moved. Wrapping myself in a towel, I stepped back into the locker room. Michael's scrubs lay discarded on the bench, and his phone sat abandoned on the edge of the sink. He must have been called away suddenly. I stared at the device, my heart hammering against my ribs. We'd always had an open-phone policy‚Äîa relic from our early days of trust and transparency. When had that changed? When had I stopped checking his messages? When had he started guarding his phone? With trembling fingers, I picked it up. The screen lit up at my touch‚Äîno password required. Perhaps overconfidence was Michael's fatal flaw; he never expected me to look. I tapped on his messaging app, and there it was‚Äîa conversation thread with Emma at the top of his recent chats. My thumb hovered over it for a moment before I pressed down, unleashing an avalanche of truth. *Miss you already. Last night was incredible.* *Can't wait to feel you again.* *Delete these after reading, baby.* I scrolled up, each message more explicit than the last. Photos appeared‚ÄîEmma in states of undress, Michael's hands on her body. I recognized our bedroom in the background of one image, the sheets I had picked out framing their betrayal. My hands didn't shake anymore. A strange calm settled over me as I methodically took screenshots, sending them to my own phone before carefully returning everything to its original state. The evidence of their affair now safely documented, I placed Michael's phone exactly where I'd found it. That night, I lay beside my husband in bed, listening to his even breathing as he slept peacefully. How many nights had he come home to me after being with her? How long had this been happening while I underwent painful fertility treatments at his mother's insistence? The next morning, I arrived at the hospital early, a folder of papers tucked under my arm. I'd spent the predawn hours preparing what looked like standard hospital credential renewal forms‚Äîbut were actually divorce papers I'd had prepared months ago during a moment of suspicion I'd talked myself out of. ""Morning,"" Michael said as he breezed into the doctors' lounge, barely glancing at me as he poured his coffee. ""Need your signature on these,"" I said, voice professional, sliding the folder toward him. ""Hospital's pushing for the credential renewals early this year."" Michael sighed with annoyance. ""Can't the admin staff handle this?"" ""They're backed up with the merger paperwork,"" I lied smoothly. ""Just sign where I've flagged, and I'll drop them off."" Without reading a single line, Michael scrawled his signature across each marked page, his arrogance working in my favor. He trusted that I, his dutiful wife, would never deceive him. ""Thanks,"" I said, tucking the folder away. As I walked out, I caught sight of Emma entering the lounge, her eyes lighting up at the sight of my husband. Little did either of them know that with those signatures, the first domino in my carefully planned revenge had just fallen.",1,1758145446.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

Magsara sana lahat ng butas niyo sa katawan (except sa pores, sana mas lumaki pa)","For context I'm 26 M, freelance artist and currently jobless. 5 years na ko sa industry and during my first 2 years regular artist ako sa isang company until I decided na magresign and after that 3 years na akong nag i studio hopping as freelance. So yung last na studio na napagtrabahohan ko okay naman yung unang project until nung natapos na. Nagtanong kase ako kung may kasunod na project ang sabi is meron naman. So naghintay ako and then nagchat naman sila nung January 27 saying na mag o onboard na daw ng artist and kasama daw ako sa lineup nila and so on. So umasa ako at naghintay ng naghintay kung kelan yung start. Nakailang hingi na ako ng update. Nakailang ""next week"" naman sila. Hanngang sa ang ending sinabihan na lang nila ako na maghanap ng ibang work sa ibang studio kasi sobra na daw yung mga na hire nila. Syempre bwusit ako that time kase pano ba naman inabot sila ng 3 months bago ininform ako na wala na pala akong aasahang project. Pero hinayaan ko na lang may pagkukulang din naman ako kasi masyado akong nagrely sa kanila and di humanap ng backup.

So and ending umuwi muna ako samin and tumulong muna sa family business. Ilang months na din after that medyo naka move on na ko. May plano na rin kami ng pinsan ko kasi magtatayo sya ng coffee shop and ako yung tatao. So maguumpisa na dapat kami last month until kinontak ulit ako ng studio na to. Nakailang tawag pa talaga sila. Pero di ko nasagot kaya chinat ko na lang. Pinapapunta nila ako sa studio nila sa katapusan ng August kase may meeting daw. New projects etc. So kinancel ko yung plano namin ng pinsan ko. Nagkasamaan pa nga kami ng loob kasi nakapaginvest na sya ng malaki sa mga gamit tas di lang matutuloy kasi need ko na naman umalis.

 And then lumuwas ulit ako ng Maynila para umatend sa meeting. Tas pagpunta ko dun hindi pala simpleng meeting lang ang daming tao and may pa catering parang xmas party. Tas yung mga tao dun sa venue mga kagaya ko ding freelance na pinapunta din ng studio kase may balak pala yung studio na kumbinsihin kaming mga freelance na magregular artist sa kanila. Need kasi nila ng artist para makakuha sila ng maraming proj. So that time medyo nabuhayan ako ng pag asa sa career ko as a digital artist kase prior to that plano ko na talaga igive up yung career ko at maghanap ng ibang linya ng trabaho. After nung program nag contract signing na kami and everything and ininform ko sila na magwowork na ako sa studio kasi nung unang project ko sa kanila wfh ako. I assume naman na mas matutuwa sila kasi mas preffered nila na nasa studio nila yung mga artist para natututukan nila kame. So ang sabi nila okay daw hintayin ko lang daw muna yung endorsement and assessment ng previous performance ko sa last project from hr and production para makapagstart na ako sa studio. That time medyo napaisip ako. Bakit need pa ng assessment if pinapirma na nila ako ng contract. Like ano yun? Nagbigay ka ng contract sa taong hindi ka pa 100% sure? But anyways di na ko masyadong nagtanong and naghintay na lang ako. 3 weeks akong nanghihingi ng update sa kanila about sa endorsement ko hanggang ngayong araw tinanong ko ulit sila at ang sabi is wala pa daw update at wala din daw silang mabibigay na work kasi over hire na naman daw sila at maghanap na lang daw muna ako ulit ng ibang work for the meantime.

So yon. Gusto ko talaga sila pagmumurahin sa chat sa totoo lang pero kelangan maging civil pa din so di na lang ako nag reply. Gusto ko din ipost yung mga screenshot ng chat namin sa fb page ng mga artist as awareness na din sa iba kaso nakapirma na ko ng nda. Kaya dito na lang ako magpopost para ma i release ng konti yung galit ko. Hahahaha.",1,1758145207.0,RantAndVentPH,0,1.0,False

Check out my Natural Bodybuilding Transformation. I put on 40lbs of muscle using intensity techniques‚Äîno PEDs, just training, consistency, progressive overload, and going ham every set.

Started as a 130lb ectomorph, discouraged after my early teen attempts flopped (couldn't get past 150). Thought natural gains were impossible, quit for 10 years. Then researched , restarted with stairs for that cognitive flow state edge at first (7 days/week, 15min x3 up 25 floors, sprinting the last for dopamine boosts to crush knowledge work - year 1).

Progressed to hypertrophy: year 2/3 - put on 40lbs of muscle. Did 9 set squats 20 reps ATG - Chicken legs blown . Now at 170lbs \~9% BF, going for 180lbs 8%.

**My Intensity-Based Hypertrophy Philosophy (My Secret Sauce):**

It's not about ego-lifts or max weights‚Äîmuscle responds to stimulus: Intensity, time under tension (TUT), full ROM, and failure. As naturals, we gotta maximize protein synthesis (by TUT + progressive overload of reps, load and LPRs), and aim for zero reps in reserve. Go hard every set; the last reps count most, LPR counts even more. Progressive overload is king: Log reps/weights meticulously (phone notes), fight for +1 rep or match last with timed rests (1:30-2:30min).

Tried bro splits, 7-day a week, w/ 'reps in reserve' ‚Äîwas OK. But every other day going hard, is when i got real gains, after watching Dorian Yates speeches (up the intensity \*and\* up the rest)

Switched to every-other-day but upped the intensity (supersets, drop sets, push to failure) and crushed 40lbs gains. Most of it was put on in 24 months.

Routine: Day 1 - Chest/Back; Off; Day 3 - Arms (Shoulders/Bis/Tris); Day 4: off, Day 5 - Legs;

Alternate calves/traps for accessory muscle work at start of gym sessions., with 2 min planks for core stability, 5 min stair climber for warmup, occasional 20 min stair climber for zone two cardio. 

**Key Intensity Techniques (My Arsenal):**

* **LPRs (Lengthened Partial Reps):**¬†After failure, 5-20 quarter/half reps at the stretch (most anabolic spot).
* **Drop Sets:**¬†Fail, drop 10-20lbs, reps again‚Äîtotal exhaustion.
* **Supersets:**¬†with any combo, drop-sets, super sets, run-down-the-rack style drop-sets, super-sets with partial reps, etc. heavy into super sets, static holds, rest-pause super sets.
* **Rest Pauses:**¬†3-5sec breaks mid-set to hit targets rep ranges
* **Static Holds:**¬†Burn at the stretch.

**Sample Leg Day:**¬†Calves (20reps ignition set + multi-dropsets w/LPRs), 2x supersets leg extensions (36reps + 16 LPRs), leg press 2x (20reps w/drops), 6x sets hack squats x 20 reps (full ROM, duck stance for quads‚Äî""ATG"" style).

**Sample Chest/Back**: Traps supersets w/statics, 3x pull-ups (15-18 clean w/LPRs +5 each set), seated rows (1x triple dropset after 1x ignition set 20 reps), 3x deadlifts 10 rep range recent addition (takes former spot of lat prayers super set), bench 3x set (drop set), dips (super deep stretch + super swith with LPR, only 5 reps done in slow tempo, but to maximum, chest ripping stretch point).

**Nutrition & Recovery (Fuel the Beast):**  
3 p. shakes/day: Bullet blender with 1/4 cup choc milk ea, 1/3 banana, scoop oatmeal, scoop protein, scoop creatine (15g+ total/day for ATP/brain‚Äîbeyond outdated 5g). Shakes = convenient full amino profile, absorbs best. Overall: Clean-ish, high protein (6 eggs in AM, 3 yolks thrown out). Eggs + 3xShake = Base diet, then I eat selectively depending on what's available + 4x coffee per day (for focus)

**My Mental tricks for consistency:** I like to log my #of sets in an excel sheet (imgur above). This is my ""canvas"", gives me something tangible for my work, i.e. credit. Gamifies the process, i can run metrics on it (1678 workouts completed, 14 604 sets completed \[...\]). I do count super sets and drop sets as multiple sets (hence the high set counts) i.e. Bench Press x3 dropset, = 6 sets in my count",1,1758145047.0,progresspics,1,0.67,False

For many disabled people, especially those of us with high support needs, forming deep, meaningful connections can feel unlikely or even dangerous to pursue. Maybe you don‚Äôt have reliable transportation to leave the house. Perhaps your immune system is too fragile to risk being in public. And sometimes, the people in your everyday life just don‚Äôt get it.

But connection isn‚Äôt only found in coffee shops or crowded parties. Sometimes it‚Äôs in a gaming lobby. A Discord server. A niche subreddit. A livestream. A shared playlist. A carefully chosen meme.

Sometimes it‚Äôs a stranger halfway across the globe who suddenly becomes a lifeline because they understand your niche obsession, your access needs, or your weird sense of humor.

And those connections? They are as real and valid as any in-person relationship.

You might not be able to drop by their house, but they might be the one who texts you ‚ÄúDid you eat today?‚Äù or celebrates your little wins like you were just awarded an Oscar. These are the people who help us build routines, foster hope, and feel like ourselves again.

‚Ä¢ Forming a group chat for fellow vent users, AAC users, or disabled creatives 

‚Ä¢ Creating a silly TikTok series about your pet‚Äôs inner monologue 

‚Ä¢ Watching a reality show at the same time each week with your bestie across the country

We met up after 2.5 weeks the other day for a coffee lunch and just talked about everything but didn‚Äôt talk about the relationship or breakup.

It‚Äôs extremely confusing to see and feel that and still feel that connection but then to get the cold shoulder after.

A little about me:

Just finishing my master‚Äôs in northern Germany.
Have lived in several WGs in Germany and abroad, so I know how to share a flat and value a clean & friendly atmosphere

Love baking (breads, cakes ‚Äî I even have a sourdough starter ü•ñ), coffee art, doodling, and making cocktails üç∏

Enjoy going for walks, chatting, and hanging out with flatmates (but also respect personal space)

I think a shared cleaning schedule is super important

What I‚Äôm looking for:

WG room / studio / small flat in Dresden

Move-in around 01 Oct (but flexible)

Flatmates who enjoy a friendly vibe and occasionally doing things together

Happy to do a Zoom call to get to know each other, and if timing works, I can visit in person too.

Was gifted this nice journal by a rather strange gentleman I met on my way out of town. He shared his fire and a fresh pot of coffee with me and aside from basic pleasantries, all he told me was he was over in this part of the country for the spring. A man of few words, I guess, and I reckon since we share that in common neither of us were too bothered by the lack of conversation. It was nice to have the company, odd as he was, at least in this bit of country he was. Looked like he just stepped off a train from New York, or Chicago, or one of them places.

He may have.

When the sun was a bit higher in the sky he broke the long silence - it was time for him to move on - to only him and God knows where. Aside from the old livestock town full of drunkards and lowlifes I'd just ridden out of, there was nothing but harsh, wild country for weeks.

I helped pack his wagon and in return got this journal, then watched the man slowly shrink into the brightening horizon, though I thought I saw him turn and tip his hat one last time before disappearing.

Something about him felt familiar yet I cannot quite put my finger on what.

-

It's been a couple weeks since I met that strange man and still he lingers in the back of my mind. Plain idiot or just naive, more likely a combination of the two, he was certainly out of place with his fancy clothes and wagon and I often find myself worrying that he's only gone and gotten himself lost or killed in this harsh land. But some small part of me gets the feeling that he is more than fine, and that is enough to keep me from up and risking my own life trying to track down the fool.

I haven't wandered too far from the old livestock town since leaving that day, moving my camp around when and wherever I pleased. Always far enough from the drunken scuttle of life there but close enough to stop in for supplies or odd end jobs to make what little money I need. So far, life has been nice and comfortable here.

Except for the sky.

Back in Wyoming where I spent the majority of my life I saw all manner of weather, all that Mother Nature had to offer, so I thought. But the skies here - some stretch of wild between Cheyenne and Oklahoma - they are bigger, almost towering over you in a way that makes men feel small. Like an old force too great for understanding.

At first I was in love with this heavy, imposing blanket of blue and stars that the mountains back home would in parts obscure. Now I find myself longing for those great mountains, those old, earthly protectors of Cheyenne.

The Shawnee and Caddo of this region tell legend of a Cyclone Person - some sort of being with long, thrashing hair that twists and devours what land it touches. I've only ever heard tell of this since coming down to these parts, and from what little the locals feel like sharing, it sure ain't nothing good. 

*‚ÄúIn the plains,‚Äù* they whisper, *‚Äúnothing can save you from the fingers of God.‚Äù*

1njph5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPinoyMen/comments/1njph5c/last_sigh/,Last Sigh,"Gusto ko lang magshare ng bigat ng loob ko at lungkot. Tungkol ito sa ex ko, 2nd BF.  Ayoko magkwento sa friends ko (nakasama nila sa ilang events at gala) at naipakilala ko sa parents ko noong more than a year na kami. Ayoko sumama tingin nila sa kanya, di ko madetalye kasi pakiramdam ko medyo sensitive yung story. Kaya sa inyo na lang di niyo naman kami kilala.

I met my 2nd BF on Bumble months after my very first relationship. 30 na ako nagkabf, yung first bf ko wala ganap puro bebe time lang at wala deep convos 9 months din yata kami nun tumagal. Parang naging setup ako may stable work yung 1st ex ko rider. Palagi sabi matumal. Kaya almost dates namin ako sumagot. Tapos dumating yung time na nagresign ako sa work due to... sabihin na natin di align sa values ko. Tapos one time sinigawan ako ng 1st ex bf ko, magastos daw ako. Yun yung time na siya sumagot ng meal namin sa isang Chinese fast food. Ayun unti unti na nagkalabuan hanggang inaaway ko kasi di ko makausap maayos. Imbes na pag usapan tutulugan ako. Until nagcheat siya.

Tapos nagdasal ako kay God. Isa lang dinasal ko sana yung susunod ko na BF makakausap ko sa lahat ng bagay. Yung may sense kausap. May substance ba. Months after nakamatch ko siya sa Bumble, natawa ako sa kanya kasi 36 years old siya. Tapos nakwento ko may nakamatch ako di totoong age nilagay 40 na. Tapos bigla ko na blurt out baka ikaw 40 na rin then he agreed. Pinakitaan ako ID totoo. Reason niya madalang magswipe sa guy kapag 40 na. 9 years gap namin. Talking stage for almost 3 months. Nabanggit niya nagbabayad siya sa live show, inaasar ko pa siya noon na kawawa ka naman bakit ka nagbabayad sa ganoon lang. Which I find normal akala ko parang porn lang. Di ba ganoon naman kapag not in a relationship minsan, porn kaagapay.  Nagdate kami for another 3 months. Doon ko naranasan sa first meet up may nagtreat ng coffee tapos nagsimba kami sa tabi ng mall (yung first ex ko palagi naiinis kapag inaaya ko magsimba kesyo wala na oras o hirap magpark ng motor) after simba he treated me again for a decent dinner. Ramen, yun seafood akin at Shoyu sa kanya. Pinagpalit niya order namin  kasi gusto niya ipatikim sa akin yung fave broth niya. Pero panay tingin niya noon sa ramen ko, kaya ipinagpalit ko ulit. Doon ko siya nagustuhan din kasi yung small act na yun. Tapos binigyan niya ako ng luto niya na chili garlic (Nakwento ko sa kanya yung 1st bf ko panay kwento masarap daw siya magluto ng chiligarlic sabi ko pahingi kahit konti, ayaw daw niya kasi konti lang yun). Dapat nga di ako tutuloy noon sa 1st date namin kasi naranasan ko na break up ayoko na masaktan. Pero he insisted na kahit iabot na lang niya yung niluto niya na chiligarlic para sa akin. Pero syempre nakipagdate  pa rin ako. May sense siya kausap sa chat eh.

After our first date, Sunday, nakipagkita siya malapit sa labasan namin.  Nagkape kami. May usapan kami from our first date 28 Jan to 25 March, dapat maka 10 dates kami. Kikilalanin ang isa't-isa. Pag dating ng March 25, tsaka kami magdedecide kung gusto namin pumasok sa relasyon. Yung week na rin na yun nagstart na ako sa bago kong work, medyo same city yung workplace namin, kapag onsite siya  sinusundo niya ako. Sabay kami hanggang terminal. Yung Jan to March na 10 dates. Nangyari lang in more than 2 weeks. Valentine's first time ko makatanggap ng gift, hindi flowers kasi alam niya, di ko alam paano ko madadala yun sa bahay. (Di ko napakilala 1st ex bf ko sa kapatid ko lang.) Tapos ako gift ko sa kanya food na niluto ko baon sa office bilang limited pa budget.

Tapos may better work opportunity na dumating sa akin. 2-3 hours travel time. March came, halos magkasunod bday namin. Magkasama namin cinelebrate ng magkasama yung mga araw nga yun. First time ko rin makatanggap ng love letter sa tanan ng buhay ko. Sinabi ko kahit wag mo na ako regaluhan letter lang masays na ako. Pero binigyan pa rin niya ako ng bagay na parehas kami. New work, new love life na totoo.

May former officemate friend ako na inoffer yung condo niya, presyong kaibigan. Kaya naman yung rent pero with the utilities konti na lang matitira sa sahod ko. Inaya ko si 2nd bf kung gusto niya kasi same din kami ng travel time kapag nag oonsite siya. Pumayag siya so di na mabigat yung rent and utilities. Alam ng close friends dating officemates ko rin kasi noong nagdedate kami nakasama na siya sa isang event.

Akala ko parang dorm lang yun para makatipid sa fare, oras at energy. Until sinabihan ako ng isang friend ko na naglilive in na kami. I asked him kung naglilive in kami kasi nauwi naman sa bahay on weekends. Sabi niya technically parang oo. So, doon na pumasok sa isip ko kapag live in mean commitment.

I cooked meals in the morning para makalibre kami ng food. Ako nagluluto at dahil sa pagod di ko na nababalanse lasa. Siya ang tiga tikim at ayos ng timpla at tulong magpack bago kami pumasok sa kanya-kanyang office. Hybrid work setup siya.

Tapos dumalang na yung pagiging intimate sa bed. Tinaning ko siya. Sabi ko bakit ganoon, two months pa lang tayo naglilive in ganoon na. Sabi niya palagi na kasi magkasama kaya ganoon. Nasa isip ko bakit yung mga articles nababasa ko 2 years bago matapos ang honeymoon phase sa married couples. Eh kasi magjowa pa lang wala pa 6 months.

June yun, nagsimula na lahat. Mahirap pala mamuhay hahaha, lahat binibili ni ultimong mga bagay sa bahay ng parents ko na taken for granted, tinitipid ko na. Naghuhugas na rin ako plato, kahit may xontact eczema ako. Yung cream ko super tipid din hahha. At ang naiyak ako, after work need ko pa magluto pag uwi. Kung uuwi ako sa amin may pagkain na, kung maabutan naghuhugas ng plato di na ko magguhugas. Pero infairness sa ex ko siya umako sa paghugas ng plato. Sobra ang natutunan ko doon  about expenses and di pagsasayang ng nga bagay. Ganoon ang routine masaya naman. Di na rin ako lumalabs with friends kasi di lumalabas si ex okay lang daw siya maglaro ng online games.

At meron isang incident pa na palagi niya bitbit belt bag niya. Nilalayo niya palagi saa akin. Ang nasa isip ko, baka marami pera siya doon, pero I shrugged it off kasi si naman ako magnanakaw. Mas nasa isip ko baka nandoon wedding ring niya, kasal na pala siya. Until isang gabi, nag away kami. Nag usap kami, inamin niya puro maintenace laman nung bag. At traumatic past relationship niya, late ko na lang nalaman ang setup sa past relastionship niya kasama for convenience wala true love and commitment pera poprovide niya yung babae company.

Di niya alam tuwing naglilinis ako, nakikita ko mga pinagbalatan. Sinearch ko pa nga ano yun. Sa puso. Napakain ko pa siya ng kung ano ano na di gaanong healthy kasi nga nagtitinda ako meals. Hinihintay ko lang siya magsabi about doon. Gumaan loon ko at least di wedding ring laman ng bag niya.

Isa pa may sumagi na rin sa isip ko bakit kaya iniiwan niya ako kapag maglalakad siya tapos ang tagal niya bumalik, naisip ko baka may minemeet siya babae nearby. Yun pala bumibili siya ng mga gamot. Importante maging open at honest sa umpisa pa lang para maiwasan mga ganoong bagay na nakakakpagpaalala. Tanggapin man o hindi at least nasave sa isang relasyon na dapat.

Until Sept came, contractual lang ako. Naisip ko bakit kaya di ako pinapakilala sa friends o family niya. Dahil ba sa status ng trabaho ko. At may trauma din ako sa industry na pinagtatrabahuan ko, nito ko lang nalaman two months ago this 2025. Nagresign ako magulo na utak ko. Nagsisinungaling ako sa parents ko, babae kasama ko sa unit. Tuwing babalik ako Sunday night, pinapadalham ako food. Sabi dagdagan mo para sa kasama mo rin. Naguguilty ako.

Nagresign ako credit card lang meron ako.  Di ako pumasa sa trabaho na regular. Nag BPO ako after a month. Di na kami nagkikita, pagdating niya sabay lang kami magdinner, pag uwi ko tutulog pa siya, matutulog din ako. Aalis soya tulog pa ako. Parang lumayo na loob namin. Wala na rin sex noon. Kaya naghanap pala ako regular na trabaho instead na contractual, renewable at maayos bayad. Naisip ko kapag regular ako maipapakilala na niya ako. Pero di ganoon nangyari. Nagkanda leche leche. Nagresign din ako sa BPO, Christmas season.  Umuwi siya sa province. Ako umuwi ss bahay namin. Pero nung nov at dec sinisikap ko magbenta ng meals sa building. Tinutulungan niya ako magdeliver.

Noong time na yun sinikap ko magkawork uli. Same industry. inamin niya sa akin nawawalan na diya ng gana sa akin simula nung nagresign ako sa work. May issue siya sa mga ganoon. Kuya niya wala work tapos iiwan siya, siya magshoshoulder ng rent and other expenses. Kaya after Christmas sinikap ko makahanap ng work Supportive siya. Kaso ganoom pala kapag may trauma sa work kahit ilang lipat di nawawala hanggat di naaddress. I resigned din.

After a month, nagkatrabaho ulit ako. 3 hours travel time. February yun. Doon ko nalaman na mayroon siyang subscription ss live shows. Nagpaaalam ako check phone niya, binigay niya. Wala sa messenger o any dating app. Sa Google Play nakita ko nagbayad siya sa isang app, sabi ko ano yun. Yun nga live shows. Nasa isip ko kapag nasa relasyon mawawala na yun. Kasi cheating yun. 1st level porn, yun iba na eh katulad ng video call sex. Tapos nagsorry siya, gusto ko na makipaghiwalay. Kasi may paniniwala  ako na kahit anong pagsubok, basta magkasama, kakayanin. Pwerd na lang kung may iba na baka yun nagusto niya kasama sa buhay magsolve ng challenges. Pero hindi binali ko, same day pinatawad ko. Yun una yata major away namin. Wala ako time magalit, mag isip. Pinatawad ko kasi gusto ko ayusin, isave, mahal ko eh.

March birthmonth namin, nagdecide kami celebrate earlier sa beach. Pagkauwi habang nasa byahe ang lakas ng period ko, may isang malaking buo na lumabas and the rest buo na cloth fresh blood Kinabukasan pumasok pa rin ako, kasi ayoko mawalan siya ng gana sa akin. Ilang beses na ako nagresign. Pero nagPT ako negative naman. Natagusan ako buti na lang nagbaon talaga ako extra damit. Di ko kinaya kinabukasan Tuesday, absent ako.

Nagresign na rin ako kalaunan. Natengga uli ng higit 1 month. Nagraraket lang ako ng meal packs buti may nakukuha. Hanggang sa may tumawag ulit, same industry. Sabi ko sa sarili ko di ko na sasayangin mataas sahod kaysa dati. Kaso yun pa rin may mga gawa na basta. Iyak na lang ginagawa ko habang nagsusumbong sa ex ko, sabi niya tiis muna. Naafford ko n rin magpatherapy.

August nagdecide kami out of town, nagpaplan itinerary. Naalala ko Sunday night, nagvc kami para sabay magpray. Nakaugalian n namin yun tapos mag good night and I love yous.

October, medyo mas nagiging toxic na sa office power tripping. At doon ko nalaman na after namin magdasal at i love you noong Aug. Nagpost siya dito sa Reddit, naghahanap makakavidsex. Isang araw di ko na kinaya, nagwala ako dito sa bahay namin. Sa kwarto ko, nasira ibang gamit. Sumigaw ako. Di ko na alam, pressure sa office, sa relasyon namim na wala ako mapagsabihan. Doon na nagstart sumakit ulo ko at mga parts ng katawan ko.

Sabi ko sakanya gusto ko maranasan ulit magChristmas Party kasi pangit previous year ko. Gusto ko rin siya bigyan ng decent gift.

Kasi yung nagresign ako, binigay ko lang sa kanya set meal at lagayan ng gamot sa Miniso. Para di kalat mga gamot sa bag.

December came, nagdinner lang kami kasi kapos sa oras. Nagbreak kami kasi nga pagod na ako makiusap maging faithful siya.

January, galit na galit ako kasi nalaman ko rin may dirty account siya sa Tiktok. Tapos di ba siya lang kachat ko sa FB puro mga sorry sa term walker type mgs suggested sa akin. Sinasabi niya msama ako mag isip pero eventually totoo lahat. Sa sobrang galit ko, on and off pakiramdam ko. Mahal at galit.
Iniignore niya messages ko. Magreply cold one liner kala mo di nakasakit.

Until, one message ko. Sabi ko papabaranggay ko siya at mag eemail ako sa HR nila. Wag daw pag usapan namin, trabaho lang daw meron siya at may sakit pa siya. Wala naman ako balak gumawa ng ganoom na eksena. Hassle pa sa side ko. Pero doon lang niya alo kinausap ng maayos, gusto ko lang naman noon malinaw na usap bakit ako niloloko. Ginawa ko lang nagmessage ako sa nanay niya. Para ihabilim siya kasi ayaw niya magpa annual check up at iba pa.

Nung nahimasmasan na ako sa  galit ko, sinabihan ko siya di ko gagawin yung magsumbong. Sa 2 condition, magcoconfess siya sa nanay niya lahat ng nangyari sa amin. Magiging opem din siya tungkol sa hinanakit niya sa family niya para di na siya maging magagalitin. At pangalawa magpapacounsel siya, para mawala addiction niya sa mga immoral stuff.

After 3 weeks, nagkabalikan kami. Mineet ko pa rin siya kahit masskit likod ko di ako makagalaw. Maybe due to stress. Alam ko totoong reason bakit nakipagbalikan siya, pero choosy pa ba ako. Mahal ko siya. Kaya ko siya hintayin hanggang maayos siya at mawala addiction niya.

Nag seek kami help sa simbahan, sabi kayanin ko daw kasi it takes years para marewire utak niya. Ganoon din sabi sa professional.

To cut it short, kahit ano ubos ko sa nararamdaman ko na love para sa kanya, magagalit ako kasi di ako pinapahalagahan. Di maubos.

Every weekends nagdedate kami, kaso di ko ramdam. Kasama ko lang siya. Every Sunday night, aawayin ko siya kasi alam ko weekdays sino-sino siya magmamasturbate.

Alam ko naman desisyon ko lahat. Pero ang hirap na umalis. Sabi niya magkakampi kami.

Family, work, siya sabay sabay na problema. 3 months ago, sobrang lost ako.  Gusto ko na mawala, di naman kaya ng gamot. Di mkatulog, makakain.

Tapos siya okay. I resigned from my job. Pero di tulad dati di ako nag aalala na baka di ako ipakilala which is never nangyari.

Sabi niya sa akin walang lalaki umamin sa kasalanan.

Habang kami bumaba confidence ko sa sarili ko. Tapos nitong huli sinabihan niya ako, gusto ko yung dating ako na nakilala niya na may parang confidence.

Lahat ng masasakit na salita sinabi ko sa kanya. Walang bayag, trabaho lang namamn meron ka, siya pinaka masamang tao nakilala ko mas masama pa sa mga nagSA sa akin. Gusto ko masayang din buhay niya ng higit 2 taon. Gusto ko siya gaguhin. Hanggang sa questionin niya sarili niya. Lahat ng naranasan ko na hirap, gusto ko maranasan niya.

Pero di nman ako ganoon. Galit ako oo, di ko matanggap sa kabila ng pagmmahal, ilang beses na pagpapatwad, wala.

Ngayon isa na lang pinagdadasal ko, gusto ko na magheal. Gusto ko na yung mas better na ako bago ako nagkarelasyon. Gusto ko matulog ng maayos at kumain ng maayos.

Turning regular photographs into stunning 3D models and nostalgic retro visuals has become surprisingly achievable with the right ChatGPT prompts. This comprehensive guide provides over 100 practical prompts that transform ordinary images into extraordinary digital art pieces.

The magic lies in understanding how to communicate your vision clearly to AI. Whether you want to convert a family portrait into a Pixar-style character or transform a landscape photo into an 80s neon masterpiece, specific prompting techniques make all the difference.

# Understanding the Basics of AI Photo Transformation

# What Makes Photo-to-3D Conversion Work

ChatGPT excels at generating detailed descriptions that other AI tools can interpret for visual creation. The process involves breaking down your source image into descriptive elements that can be reconstructed in three dimensions.

Your original photo serves as inspiration rather than direct input. The AI analyzes compositional elements, lighting conditions, color palettes, and spatial relationships to generate comprehensive instructions for 3D modeling software or other AI image generators.

Think of ChatGPT as your creative translator. It takes your rough ideas about transforming a photo and converts them into precise, technical language that 3D rendering programs understand perfectly.

# The Science Behind Retro Style Generation

Retro aesthetics follow specific visual patterns that AI can replicate consistently. Each decade has distinct characteristics: the 1980s favored neon gradients and geometric shapes, while the 1990s embraced grunge textures and muted color schemes.

ChatGPT recognizes these patterns and can generate prompts that capture authentic period-specific elements. The key is providing enough contextual details about your desired era while maintaining flexibility for creative interpretation.

Modern AI understands color theory, typography trends, and cultural references from different time periods. This knowledge enables it to create prompts that produce genuinely nostalgic results rather than generic ""retro-looking"" outputs.

if the food is not up to par i wont eat it. not hot enough/fresh enough/doesn‚Äôt taste like it usually does or as good as i thought it would. last week wanted something light for breakfast. i made my chef friend a coffee and they asked me if i wanted food and i asked for exactly what id been thinking about all morning. avocado toast. my other friend was ordering acai bowls and asked me if i wanted one and i said that sounded amazing. got both at the same time. didn‚Äôt touch the avocado toast because it was toast and guacamole (sorryüíî n don‚Äôt worry my coworkers ate it)  and then the acai bowl i had wanted so badly and looked so pretty and tasted great.. wasn‚Äôt that hungry anymore, too cold or something idk but i didn‚Äôt fucking eat it. spent $15 and gave away something that was made for me. and no i dont think i ate that day. 

like idk just wanted to vent fr. i know why it happened i guess i just don‚Äôt know what to do about it *now*. i feel like im trying, making smoothies even tho i hate them, ill drink naked smoothies, ensure makes me sick but ive had one. then i just struggle to force myself to eat, i kinda cant. even munchies dont help anymore. i‚Äôm not hungry.

I've been routinely drinking black coffee (2-3 cups per day) and beer (IPAs/hazies) with my aligners in. I typically brush my trays 2-3X per day before putting them back in after meals. The staining has been gradual over the 2 weeks, so while I could tell it was slowly staining, I didn't realize how much until I pulled out my new trays today. My teeth aren't brilliant white pearls anyways so I honestly don't care about the staining but thought I'd share the side-by-side results for other newbies who may be wondering just how bad coffee staining can be on aligners.",9,1758143146.0,Invisalign,4,1.0,False

I was able to score some soft-close drawers from Facebook Marketplace, but they left a weird slot on the bottom left, so I‚Äôm also not sure if there‚Äôs anything useful for it or if I should just fill it with a piece of oak. One of the drawers is sitting where the countertop will go. There are two outlets in the back, and the cutout in the front is a light switch. There wasn‚Äôt much we could do about that, but we‚Äôll make do! 

I ordered more oak for additional shelves, but am unsure how many to put in. I was thinking maybe some half-deep shelves for cups. Is there anything else we should consider? Maybe adding a small pegboard on the right side out of oak? 

I would love to hear any crazy ideas since it‚Äôs still an open canvas right now. We have never had a dedicated space for our coffee/tea stuff until this was made. We don‚Äôt drink alcohol, so this is our best way to create an area for socializing with friends and guests. Do any experienced home baristas or pros have recommendations on making this really beautiful and functional?

Hi - My neighbor has grown increasingly hostile towards us, as he‚Äôs putting a drive way btw our houses, to a garage in his backyard. We are not happy about it, but have had any reaction, except document what he has been doing (pictures). He has repeatedly yelled at my parents (80 & 81 yr old) to ‚ÄúWatch the property line old man‚Äù, to my father and yelled at my mother to, ‚Äúget off his property‚Äù when he was cutting trees down on the lot line, and she went out to speak to him about it. 

Since then, he continues to escalate with complaints about us to the town, sent a letter from his lawyer for us to cut down trees he feels are ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù, installed super bright lights that shine in bedroom windows ans illuminate our whole back yard, and now he‚Äôs installed cameras that directly surveillance our direct deck/back yard and side of house. We literally can not do anything on our property that is not surveyed by the neighbor. 

You can not step outside now in our back deck without being filmed. For example, my mother loves to sit on the back deck early morning, drink her coffee, and listen to the birds, in her nightgown, now this will be recorded.

I did a cursory review of NYS Law and it basically says expectation of privacy does not usually include the front yards, porch, or anything you can see from the street. However, backyards, there is an expectation of privacy. We are in process of getting a lawyer, but wanted to check-in on this. Also, these actions by him feel hostile and entering into harassment.

currently, i am 5‚Äô7 and 101kg. around this time last year, i was approximately 85kg and had been steadily losing weight since being 120kg in early 2023. the issue is that a lot of my weight loss came from disordered eating, making myself go hungry for days and consuming nothing but black coffee and the occasional small meal. i obviously don‚Äôt want to go back to that strategy for a multitude of reasons. 
since late 2024 and getting into a relationship, i‚Äôve been steadily gaining again. i never really went above 95kg, until around a month ago when i came back from holiday. me and my boyfriend had been eating a lot, but also staying reasonably active with walking, swimming and cycling. however, for the last three days, my boyfriend got really sick and we spent the majority of our time indoors - meanwhile i‚Äôd eat whatever we had out of boredom. the habit just sort of carried on when we got home, and for the past few weeks i‚Äôve been unable to control my eating like i used to. i‚Äôve been very down because of work, my cycle and coming off my antidepressants.
the other night, my boyfriend gently told me that he‚Äôs not as attracted to me since i‚Äôve gained weight. i don‚Äôt hold it against him, as we‚Äôve had the conversation about what would happen if there was any weight gain from either of us and whether or not it would effect how much we were attracted to each other, so realistically i knew this reaction was coming. he wasn‚Äôt cruel about it. he told me he‚Äôs still attracted to me, but that he just wants me to be healthy. naturally, it‚Äôs really knocked my confidence and how i‚Äôm feeling in general. i‚Äôve cried a lot. i have been forcing myself to exercise more and have been tracking my calories meticulously. 
the trouble is is that i‚Äôm so worried about whether or not i‚Äôm doing enough, how i can be doing more, and how much i struggle with keeping consistent. i‚Äôm in a deficit of around 1800kcal - is this enough for someone who is 5‚Äô7 and 101kg/222lbs? i‚Äôve been either cycling for around 20-30 minutes or walking for over an hour per day. is this enough? i‚Äôd rather avoid the gym, as my local is never open on hours that suit me and i have other financial responsibilities to be concerned with. 
how can i stay consistent? like is there anything i can do to truly help me stay consistent other than staring in the mirror, feeling like shit about myself and forcing myself? i just want to know if anyone else does anything to make consistency easier, as my method often seems to result in a lot of insecurity and self hatred.
all in all, i‚Äôm just looking for any advice. anything is helpful. i‚Äôve been battling with my weight ever since i was a young teenager, and i‚Äôm so tired of it. if anyone has been in a similar situation, please let me know what you did to help yourself. thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è",2,1758143097.0,WeightLossAdvice,2,1.0,False

Yesterday, after 2 app store rejections, it finally went live on the App Store. 

We started with almost no mobile development background and just figured things out along the way. Did a course on React native on Udemy two years back, which really helped with the debugging. Learned a ton, hit roadblocks, and thought I‚Äôd share some takeaways for anyone else starting out:

# Tools & Setup

* **Replit Expo Remix template** ‚Äì Perfect jumpstart for anyone new to React Native/Expo. [Here‚Äôs the link](https://replit.com/@replit/Expo).
* [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) **for backend** ‚Äì Smooth Postgres + auth + file storage. Biggest learning curve was **RLS policies**: you *must* carefully define who can access what, otherwise things will break in confusing ways.
* [Superwall](https://superwall.com/) **for paywalls** ‚Äì Great for testing pricing models and comes with prebuilt templates. No subscription needed to start.
* [Resend](https://resend.com/emails) **+ Supabase auth** ‚Äì Easy email flow for sign-up/reset password. You can customize templates, and it also integrates with Supabase smoothly. I tried AWS SES but set up was a lot more complicated, Resend is good enough to get things rolling.

# Dev Workflow

* Started with **Expo Go** ‚Üí eventually switched to **Expo development builds** once we needed push notifications + in-app purchases.
* **Tables** ‚Äì Asked Replit assistant for SQL script to create tables in Supabase ‚Üí then copy/pasted into Supabase SQL editor to keep schema in sync.
* **Agent to Assistant** ‚Äì We started by using Replit Agent to generate the overall skeleton of the app. Once the foundation was in place, we switched to Assistant since its responses were more consistent and less disruptive to our existing functions. My recommendation: use Agent for big structural changes, and Assistant for refining and building features.
* **Don't apply changes immediately** ‚Äì Always preview code changes and get a sense of what's reasonable or not. Uncheck changes if it is not going in the right direction.

# App Store Lessons

* Forgot **purpose strings** (why you need photos/location) ‚Üí instant rejection. The purpose string needs to explain why the app needs access and an example of how the user's data will be used.
* Needed to add [EULA](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/) \+ ‚ÄúDelete account‚Äù option (common first-timer misses).
* **Subscriptions** ‚Äì had a weird case where a subscription plan didn‚Äôt show at first. It showed up earlier today, it was mostly due to App Store propagation delay.
* **App launch delay** ‚Äì We assumed App Store approval would only take a few days, but that was naive. Always budget an extra 1‚Äì2 weeks into your launch timeline.

# The App

CupCircle is a coffee chat app for professionals to meet IRL. The spark came from Maxine Barbier (founder of Timeleft) who once did a ‚Äúcoffee with 100 strangers‚Äù challenge.

We also stumbled upon the Breakfast App through their ads on Instagram. In most big cities, however, breakfast meetups are unrealistic. Coffee is more universal. 

If you're curious here's the app. We‚Äôre currently live only in NYC: [cupcircle.co](https://cupcircle.co/)",3,1758142741.0,replit,0,0.8,False

1njp1wz,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetNewsme/comments/1njp1wz/how_consumer_education_can_shape_pricing_of/,How Consumer Education Can Shape Pricing of Complementary Products,"A new marketing study finds that informing shoppers about required add‚Äëons can lessen the need for antitrust action on tied products.

- Firms often tie consumables like printer ink, coffee pods, or theater snacks to a base product, forcing purchases at premium prices.
- Researchers distinguish sophisticated consumers who anticipate extra costs from naive buyers who discover them only after purchase.
- When regulation obliges firms to allow third‚Äëparty options, sophisticated shoppers typically switch to cheaper sources, while naive consumers often stay with the original seller.
- In mixed markets, mandatory openness reduces company profits but raises overall consumer welfare, because naive buyers benefit from lower add‚Äëon prices.
- The authors suggest companies can protect margins by educating customers about total ownership costs, and policymakers should tailor rules to the proportion of naive shoppers.

Why it matters: Better consumer awareness can preserve competition without harming firm profitability, and targeted regulations can improve welfare without unnecessary market distortion.

1njp0s5,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1njp0s5/octobers_twilight/,October's Twilight,"Amidst the gloomy twilight of October, a sense of dejection has shrouded my soul.

A pervasive mist of unease has settled in the atmosphere, scarcely dispelled by the flicker of hope that resides within my heart.

I can't rid myself of the feeling that an impending doom looms on the horizon, conspiring to exacerbate my inner turmoil.

Every step forward I take feels heavier, resonating with the weight on my heart.

The ghosts of the past lurk within the dark corners of my mind, too real to be dismissed as a child's wordplay, haunting me like never before.

In my quest for an escape, I, once again, gulp down the poison of your memories, bittersweet, like a blend of coffee and chocolate milk.

With a familiar aftertaste lingering on my tongue, I whisper your name as a final plea ‚Äî before the creeping darkness envelopes me ‚Äî yearning for its echoes to transcend beyond the seven realms and touch eternity.

‚Äì H. S.

...

I know it's not October yet, but I have been writing prose-poetry for a while and I want to submit my work for publication.

I am not sure if my writing good is enough for paid publication. Thought of submitting some pieces to Poetry Foundation but it sounded too ambitious. Should I start smaller?

Also, can I publish under just my initials (H. S.) instead of my full name? These pieces are really personal and I am not comfortable with people I know finding out I wrote them.

Constructive criticism would be appreciated.

We've been able to spend time together in-person twice during the past 7 months, for about a week back in spring here in the US, and then for two weeks in Sweden last month. We had a wonderful time together, and he introduced me to his parents, it went great, they told him how much they liked me, no problems.  
  
Pretty much as soon as I returned home from Sweden, I started to pick up on this hot-and-cold behavior. It wasn't always this way and I even struggle with wondering if I'm imagining it, because when I have asked him about it, he insists everything is fine and that he is just tired and I should ""just relax"". The trouble is, though, there are overall concrete differences I can point to between recent behavior and what things were like before. For instance, we have always called each other cute goofy pet names in Swedish, especially when saying goodnight, and although I still do this, he rarely reciprocates anymore. He doesn't want to talk on the phone as much (has outright declined to do so a few times when I've asked, even), and doesn't initiate playing video games or watching tv/movies together on the weekends, while previously he was eager to have our phone calls and would be asking me as early as Monday or Tuesday most weeks what I might like to play or watch together in the upcoming weekend. 

We are both introverts and highly value our alone time, but even when we were together for those two weeks last month, we had no problem giving each other that space. He would chill at his PC while I cooked, or sometimes I'd just take a nap, or hang out in the kitchen listening to the radio, drinking my coffee, and reading or crocheting while he did his own thing too, so I don't think it's just post-visit social burnout. 

I'm trying to be cool about this and not overthink it, but I've been through relationships in the past where men were not honest with me, and I eventually gaslit myself into believing when they told me I was imagining it, only for everything to come out later and turn my life upside down. I don't want to badger him and push him away by repeatedly asking if it really is nothing, but the differences are so noticeable to me that it's hard to ignore, and it's causing me to feel quite lonely and anxious.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

Words like¬†*very*,¬†*truly*, and¬†*amazing*‚Äîonce reserved for the remarkable‚Äîare now applied to everything from a decent cup of coffee to a joke that made you exhale slightly through your nose. In striving to emphasize, we have numbed. In trying to impress, we have diluted. Describing the truly extraordinary now seems to require an arsenal of superlatives ‚Äî and still, it falls short.

Perhaps there is something to be said for restraint. Perhaps being¬†*good*¬†can be good enough. A game that is¬†*enjoyable*¬†need not be life-changing. And a Wednesday evening spent playing a clever card game in pleasant company can be‚Ä¶ quite nice.

Of course, one might suggest that¬†Wednesday Night Cuttle¬†is beyond invigorating. That it is transcendent, life affirming.

1njos75,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1njos75/i_really_like_this_guy_but_i_dont_know_if_hes/,I really like this guy but I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs interested in me. How can I approach without seeming weird?,"I (18f) just started uni and I‚Äôve really been trying to get out of my shell a bit. I went to an all girls school so no problems making friends there. My problem is I have no idea how to talk to guys. I‚Äôve never had a relationship. Anytime I talk to a guy, I just get flustered and awkward. I‚Äôve only just gotten a little better talking to guys in class, but outside of class I‚Äôm a disaster.

I‚Äôm asking for help because there‚Äôs a guy (18m) I have class with who‚Äôs really cute and funny and I want to get to know better. We share two classes together. One of the classes is a lecture and there‚Äôs about 250 students so it‚Äôs virtually impossible to talk then. The other class is about 25 students. We have in class discussions and so I‚Äôve kind of spoken to him through those a lot but never one-on-one. I could be reading this all wrong but I feel like he looks at me a during class discussions and makes direct eye contact a lot. He‚Äôs really nice to me but he‚Äôs also really nice to everyone which makes it hard to tell if he‚Äôs interested or not. We seem to have a good rapport but I just can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs interested 

My friends told me to just ask if he wants to grab a coffee sometime but I‚Äôm scared that if he‚Äôs not interested it‚Äôll make things awkward in class. But at the same time I‚Äôm worried that if I don‚Äôt do something I‚Äôll lose my chance because it‚Äôs only a semester class. I haven‚Äôt seen him on campus outside of class and I can‚Äôt talk to him afterwards because I have a class to get to right after. I thought about messaging him on social media but I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs got an account. I found one that I‚Äôm about 96.7% sure is him but there‚Äôs no profile picture and I feel like that would come off as weird or creepy. And my best friend who I‚Äôve known for six years is also interested in him. She knows about my crush and asked if I still like him and now I feel really guilty and bad. What can I do to approach him normally? How can I talk to him without seeming awkward or creepy? What would you honestly recommend I should do about my friend? Should I step aside or go for it? I really like this guy but she also really likes him. I need help please",1,1758141957.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1njoqug,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1njoqug,"How about a 2022 British Ration, Menu 4; was it good?","Hi folks!

A 2022 British ration today! 

These things always bring their A game. Hearty and filling. 

Pics 1-4: packaging and contents. No drinks reviewed in this one, I just don't drink them anymore as they just have way too many calories for my needs now. No cola beverage base, so we know we don't have to make anyone suffer with that üòâ.

Coffees get used in Protein shakes, just haven't used them yet.

Pic 5: salted peanuts! Yes, these were salted! Not as good as Nut Walker, but tasty enough for sure!

Pic 6: Biscuits, Brown. These are SO good!!! Ever so slightly sweet, nutty, crunchy, and wholesome! These are wonderful just on there own even! You get 6 in a pack, but the 4 shown were whole and not broken, so that's why only 4 shown.

Pic 7: fruit flapjack. Love these things! So thick and dense, full of oats and fruit, sweet but not overly sweet. A very hearty item!

Pic 8: Orange cap means apple Peach puree! This stuff was excellent. Only put a small amount in the spoon to show it off, rest was consumed straight from pouch! So smooth and refreshing! I should have refrigerated this but forgot! Top notch flavor and texture IMHO. 

Pic 9: Chicken Sausage and Beans. This was the bad component in this ration. The chicken Sausages were so absurdly soft and completely bland. The beans were so bland as well. This one was hard to get down, but it was a meal, so I ate it. The other 2 mains were orders of magnitude better! 

Pic 10: Chicken Curry, Potatoes and Rice. Accompanied by two biscuits with that wonderful Andros Apricot Jam! This was a great lunch! Very hearty chicken chunks, really nice potatoes with great texture, and very flavorful rice! A creamy well spiced dish. Was shocked by this one compared to the beans and sausages.

Pic 11: Pasta Bolengnase.  This was fantastic! My favorite main in the ration by far. I dare to say the only ration pasta dish I've liked more than this is my all time favorite ration main ever, the Swedish Pasta Bolengnase.  Very flavorful,  great texture on the pasta, meat was ample, just an all around great dish! I did add crushed red pepper to spice it up too!

I did eat the vanilla cake for breakfast one morning but forgot a pic! It was moist and delicious!

My kiddo had the hot cocoa and loved it!

These British rations are top notch quality and contents. Give them a shot, they have a ton of different menu items to try! I'm thankful for getting to experience another one!

Take care folks!",6,1758141866.0,MRE,0,1.0,False
1njoqgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1njoqgx/had_to_stop_nc/,Had to stop nc,"I had to stop no contact yesterday as my ex is moving out of her house and asked me to pick up the last of my stuff, so I drove there to get it. It felt weird when I first got there,it was like we were just associates,at least that's the vibe I got from her. I stayed for a few coffees and we talked about most stuff except the relationship but then I went against everything I've read and asked her if she can see us getting back together.  She said she would rather leave it where it is and I said look ive had time to look at everything you have said about me and you are right,I fuxked up. Just let me do what you wanted me to do,ie move from where im living, find a place closer to her,get help for the lies I tell.  Which is true ,ive told some elaborate lies just so I don't have to argue with her..its wrong I know and cowardly but im looking into therapy to see if i can find out why I do it and stop. She asked me why im willing to do all this now and I said I don't want to lose her  .I basically did everything I wasn't supposed to do, I couldn't help myself. I even said ""Ive read it shouldn't be doing any of this,but frankly I don't give a fuxk,I don't want to lose you "". 
I sent a couple of texts last night when I got back showing her my DNA results from ancestry.com ,which she and I had talked about while I was there and I showed her how to do hers. She replied to a couple of my messages, but then I sent 2 more and she stopped replying.  Have I stuffed up? Where should I go from here ",1,1758141841.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False

\-- [First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1kjh0gm/crew_application_accepted/) \* [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1nep2xi/lost_and_alone_on_a_new_world_haasha_25/) \* Next \* [Wiki & Full Series List](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/authors/majestic_teach_6677/) \--

Who‚Äôs talented enough to fall asleep draped over a sink in the refresher? That would be me.

After getting a great meal from the embassy cafeteria of diced salami, apple, green peppers, and locally grown mi‚Äôwawa root, I was given access to a refresher and a chance to deep clean my fur. I discovered the entire past events had taken a lot more out of me than I expected when I woke up on Doc Anders‚Äô therapy couch covered with a soft blanket.¬†

When I stumbled out of the room to answer nature‚Äôs call, I was informed by one of the Marines on security that I had fallen asleep in the refresher draped over the sink. She had moved me to Doc Ander‚Äôs couch and apologized if moving me caused any discomfort. However, what she told me didn‚Äôt sink in immediately.

‚ÄúFawabr‚Ä¶guh‚Ä¶ back kink,‚Äù I think is what my groggy brain was able to spew out as I went up to the marine, leaned my forehead against her side, and pointed at my aching back.

To be clear, this was not an indictment of the couch. I had twisted myself in what would have been a very uncomfortable position on a normal bed, but the couch was extra smushy so I didn‚Äôt notice until I had stayed in the position too long and woken up with a kink. Five minutes later and my back felt much better, so I thanked the marine and started to head to the refresher. I stopped when a memory surfaced.

After cleaning my fur, I had a vague recollection of being thirsty and going to the sink‚Ä¶ and what the marine told me finally sunk in. ‚ÄúWay to make a good impression, girlie,‚Äù I grumbled to myself and turned back to her.

‚ÄúDraped over the sink?‚Äù I asked tentatively.¬†

‚ÄúUmm. Yeah,‚Äù she said with a bit of embarrassment. ‚ÄúI actually took a picture because I didn‚Äôt want to move you and get yelled at for touching a Py‚Äôrapt‚Äôch without consent.‚Äù

She then showed me the photo. I wouldn‚Äôt exactly say I was draped over the sink. More snuggled into the wall and leaning on the sink for moral support.

I‚Äôm sure most sapients would have been deeply embarrassed by the image and want it deleted, but those sapients don‚Äôt have fur and haven‚Äôt lived with humans. At a bar not long ago, Streggy and I both learned humans have an insane desire to overdocument furred crewmates. Often in embarrassing positions, so this just seemed par for the course. As a result, I simply shrugged at the photo and said, ‚ÄúCould be worse.‚Äù¬†

I then went to the refresher, took care of business, and returned to the comfy couch to catch up on messages on my datapad.

Step one - proof of life! I wrote a quick mass message to the crew of the TEV Ursa Minor to let them know I was safe and feeling okay. To prevent any accusations of somebody stealing my datapad and sending a fake message, I took a selfie with my new favorite human condiment - honey!

Remember how my meal had locally grown mi‚Äôwawa root? It‚Äôs a healthy and nutritious option to balance out sugar intake and keep digestion normal, but while initially crunchy it quickly devolves into watery fake mashed potato consistency in your mouth with a paste-like taste to match. However, my side of mi‚Äôwawa had been lightly drizzled with something I thought was maple syrup. I mostly avoided the root veggie until I sucked up my pride and took a bite for my health. Oh, stars‚Ä¶ you humans know how to find the most deliciously sugary things. Honey is my new favorite human food! It‚Äôs truly alive on the tongue and elevates even the worst bland to enjoyable.

Even better, not only is honey acceptable to drizzle over foods, you can also put it into drinks! That said, I‚Äôm once again confounded why humans ruin perfectly good things by adding them to bad drinks. Raspberry syrup with coffee? Fruit abuse, especially if you then add chocolate syrup. Tea with honey? The smart sapient skips the tea and just adds a dollop of honey to warm water. This was my beverage of choice for the remainder of the evening.

I was debriefed on my trip by a Terran Marine Sergeant who was very polite, funny, and not one bit shouty. We went over the complete details of what happened with Tac-1 and myself first, and then proceeded to more useful things. I was given an expense code to charge food and travel to the embassy as well as given a room in the staff quarters for tonight. Unfortunately, there was going to be an embassy event tomorrow so the accommodations would only be for tonight, but the Sergeant said they‚Äôd get something set up for the remainder of my stay on the planet. She would have details tomorrow.

She then asked if she could give me a belly rub, an offer I couldn‚Äôt refuse. After a few minutes, we both had satisfied smiles and she went into the hallway. There were then heavy footsteps stalking down the hall away from me and I heard her yell something out before a door slammed.

‚ÄúWHAT PART OF NEAR COMPLETE MISSION FAILURE ISN‚ÄôT COMPUTING?‚Äù

Perhaps I misjudged her ability to be shouty. My instant conclusion was that I didn‚Äôt want to be whoever was in that room with her now.

As for the ship I had arrived on and claimed for salvage? I had a quick discussion with Devin from the legal department.¬†

‚ÄúYou should be aware that Captain Victor has promoted himself to Commodore,‚Äù he informed me with a deep sigh.¬†

‚ÄúHow does that work?‚Äù I wondered aloud.

‚ÄúHe now commands two FTL capable ships, and as a pirate captain demanded his right to be recognized as a commodore,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúHe also got in touch with the impound lot and the docking fees were put onto the TEV Ursa Minor‚Äôs expense accounts, so you‚Äôre off the hook there. We‚Äôll get you reimbursed for the deposit once we get the paperwork finished.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds pretty simple,‚Äù I said happily.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find out,‚Äù he responded cryptically before continuing. ‚ÄúAfter all, you‚Äôre the only authorized member of the Dread Pirates Enginerd in this sector. You‚Äôve been assigned to get the paperwork all sorted out as well as arrange to have the ship updated and overhauled.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, I‚Äôm doing what?‚Äù I blurted out.¬†

‚ÄúThis is what happens when your captain sends a message threatening the diplomatic corps. Evidently, Terran courier vessels will be boarded and plundered if anyone in the embassy looks at you or his new vessel the wrong way,‚Äù he said blandly. ‚ÄúOn the legal side, someone should probably remind him that his letter of marque is null and void if he starts attacking allied vessels.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnything else I should know?‚Äù I said a bit dumbly, still not sure of my new fate. I figured I‚Äôd get a day or two to relax, then be tossed on a passenger or cargo ship to join back up with the crew.¬†

‚ÄúChief Engineer Rosa demands installation of at least one 12 pounder,‚Äù Devin said with a polite smile. ‚ÄúAlthough she would prefer if you installed enough 12 pounders for a proper broadside. We‚Äôll cover those details after you get all the salvage paperwork completed.‚Äù

I‚Äôd have to look up what 12 pounders are, and we set an early morning meeting to get the salvage process started. Ordinarily I might object to getting up early like any sane sapient, but I was tired and planning to turn in early so I‚Äôd likely be up early. Also, it felt right to have something to do rather than sit around and get trapped by memories of the past few days.

My last order of business? A session with Doc Anders who wanted to go through some exercises and help me destress. It turns out that all sapient brains are pretty similar in some regards. After a traumatic situation it can be difficult to immediately shift your brain out of fear and flight mode even if you‚Äôre now completely safe. We just talked about how I was feeling and did a few evaluations which showed that I was still a bit jumpy, so we then moved onto a few recommended exercises.

He invited two other embassy workers to join us, Joline and Greg. They came armed with snacks and games! The initial meet and greet was short before the games came out.¬†

I discovered that Rise of the Intergalactic Mini Muffins is a pretty popular game among humans at the moment. As this was only my second time playing it, my strategy was more to play with the various evil muffin powers and see what chaos they created.

As the Raspberry Tarts, I used my special skill Pucker Up to reverse Joline‚Äôs use of the Strawberry Shortcake power Jammed. I didn‚Äôt need to do it as she was just using the skill to steal a few bags of baking flour from Greg, but I was working on chaos theory.

‚ÄúWhy, Haasha?‚Äù she said with a pout. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúTalk to your builder about why they built your house of berry out of straw?‚Äù I joked.

From that point forward, there seemed to be an unspoken agreement that winning the game was optional, using your special power to mess with someone was the way to go. We played three more rounds of the game before just chatting for a little while. The welcome back to society integration exercise completed, Doc Anders had one final relaxation exercise for me.

Understanding that I hadn‚Äôt had a good scritch in some time, he had arranged for a local human massage therapist to come in and give me a full body massage. I was escorted to my room for the night on the second floor. They had a series of 8 rooms for visiting staff or overnight workers, and it looked to me that they took cleaning pretty seriously as each door had a small flap in the bottom where a cleaning bot could easily enter and quietly do its thing. When we got to my room for the night, it wasn‚Äôt large by human standards but certainly quite roomy and cozy by Py‚Äôrapt‚Äôch. It had a single queen size bed, which would be called empress sized where I grew up.¬†

More importantly, there was a short woman with dark brown skin and hair in a long braid. She smiled at me with a twinkle in her brown eyes and helped me up onto a padded table she had set up in the middle of the room. Doc Anders wished me a good night, and left me in the capable hands of‚Ä¶

Well, I‚Äôll be honest. I forgot her name. I remember it being beautiful and melodic, and her voice was calm and soothing as we chatted a bit while she got started. Then her fingers started their magic, and my brain could only concentrate on a single thought.

If I ever get rich, screw having a butler or personal chef. I‚Äôm going to have a staff of human masseurs on call.¬†

I originally thought things would be going straight to That Human Bar, but Haasha informed me there were important events at the embassy to go over first. I hope you enjoyed, and stay tuned! The truly important experience was how she went through Embassy Training - the next escapade which will be posted tomorrow (if I remember) or Friday (if I get distracted)! And you definitely don‚Äôt want to miss her training. It‚Äôs truly special. Take a guess what training she's about to get!

There was a power outage in my community, afterwards we all gathered at Starbucks to charge our phones. Place was very busy. I noticed a young woman sitting at a table for 4 so I sat across from her plugged up my phone and before I could say a word she said I was not allowed to sit there because I made her feel uncomfortable. I am well groomed, well dressed etc she doesn't seem as if she suffered from a mental illness.  20min later a new seat became available so I didn't hesitate to relocate. 2 min later a black man did exactly what I did but she never said anything to him. I personally think it was (white guilt) the reason she didn't say anything to the man. I went over to her table I saw a look of disbelief when she saw me coming, she looked down the entire time not saying a word as I started a conversation with this man to share my experience before he arrived. 
It definitely bothered him and he looked at her and said just try to make me move! I couldn't help to laugh inside.  Me & the man had a great conversation while now I bet she was feeling uncomfortable.  I don't understand what is happening to people. Does America have a heart problem!? While all this was happening I kept trying to tell myself WWJD.  Make me leave the table.... no!

She had been living with my NMom, helping care for her after a bad fall a few months ago that left her in the hospital for weeks. During that time, she had power of attorney and acted as medical proxy. And with that power, she escalated ‚Äî verbally abusing me, even in front of our mom. That moment broke something in me. After years of manipulation and dysfunction, I finally went no contact with her.

My mom didn‚Äôt ask how I was feeling. Didn‚Äôt show a shred of empathy. She just kept saying,¬†**‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs going on between you two.‚Äù**¬†As if the history wasn‚Äôt there. As if none of it had happened. So I wrote her a long, detailed letter after she came home from the hospital ‚Äî laying out years of toxic behavior, and why my wife and I had to protect ourselves. Still, my mom never acknowledged anything. Not even a performative ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you feel that way.‚Äù

It made me reflect on everything.

Just¬†*last year*, when we were planning our wedding, my sister insisted I invite her boyfriend ‚Äî a man who made both me and my wife extremely uncomfortable. My mother‚Äôs response?

**‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you invite him? Can you please reconsider? If he doesn‚Äôt go, she‚Äôll be miserable‚Ä¶ and that means I will be miserable.‚Äù**

And when I pushed back, she dismissed our concerns:¬†*‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not that bad.‚Äù*

But now, after everything, my mom has completely changed her tune ‚Äî claiming this week that¬†*she never liked him from the beginning*. It‚Äôs just another example of her rewriting reality to suit her narrative.

And I thought even further back‚Ä¶ when my other sister (the scapegoat) went no contact after the golden child¬†*did cocaine around her newborn*. My mom shrugged it off: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no big deal.‚Äù She refused to push for rehab. Instead, she told me and the golden child to stop speaking to the scapegoat ‚Äî because¬†*she*¬†wasn‚Äôt going along with my mom‚Äôs terms.

After that fallout, my parents wrote my scapegoat sister out of the will entirely. Then they made me and the golden child co-owners of the house ‚Äî under a life estate to my mother. That alone says a lot about how conditional everything is in this family.

And now here I am ‚Äî the only child left who still had¬†*some*¬†kind of contact with her. And that‚Äôs where the pressure really comes from. Not because of the will, not because of legality ‚Äî but because I‚Äôm the last one standing. And in my mother‚Äôs world, that makes me the default caretaker.

This is the pattern. Enable the golden child. Silence or exile the rest of us. Rework the past whenever convenient.

After I went low contact, my sister hired a nurse for my mom ‚Äî someone she met through her (now ex) deadbeat boyfriend. The nurse had credentials, yes, but was clearly being used. One day she left me a voicemail, asking me to ‚Äúcome back to the family‚Äù while my sister could literally be heard whispering instructions in the background. It was unsettling and desperate. I didn‚Äôt fall for it.

Now that the golden child is gone, it feels like there‚Äôs this unspoken assumption that I‚Äôll step in ‚Äî that my wife and I will move in and take over everything. But the very idea makes us uncomfortable. The house is a mess and desperately needs renovation. Even staying there for a couple nights felt invasive ‚Äî we suspect my mom went through our belongings.

And the emotional games haven‚Äôt stopped. My wife ‚Äî who is nothing but compassionate ‚Äî kept offering help like food and coffee. My mom would politely decline‚Ä¶ until the moment my wife sat down to rest,¬†*then*¬†she‚Äôd ask. It‚Äôs subtle, but it‚Äôs the same old manipulation.

I‚Äôm not worried that my wife will fall for it. She sees right through it ‚Äî¬†*we both do*. But it‚Äôs still draining. It‚Äôs still frustrating. And we‚Äôve worked so hard to build a life of stability and peace ‚Äî we don‚Äôt want to give that up just to walk back into a dysfunctional environment we fought so hard to leave.

We‚Äôre considering hiring a geriatric care manager to assess the situation. My mom is doing better physically and probably doesn‚Äôt need a full-time nurse anymore. Realistically, she may need home health aides ‚Äî potentially even overnight support ‚Äî especially if she still needs medication at midnight.

2. Can you use a UV light to cure the IPA faster or is there an advantage to leaving it out in the sun(also how long do you leave it out?)?

1njoeu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1njoeu0/im_leaning_towards_atheism_but_im_a_new_convert/,I'm leaning towards atheism but I'm a new convert to the Mormon church. What should I do?,"I'm going through a decisive moment in my life.

I'm deeply doubtful about the existence of God. I was baptized in the Mormon church in May of this year, partly because of the missionaries and because I liked the people and the way the sermons, hymns, and so on were conducted. I believed in God, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, and everything, so I thought, why not? I have nothing against the church, although I've read some problematic things that I disapprove of, and I have my questions. The thing is, lately I've started researching and questioning the veracity of biblical stories, Mormonism, and the existence of God. I know it was a short time between the decision to be baptized and where I am now, but for some reason I'm only now obsessed with this subject and realized it could all be made up! I'm in a difficult position because I love the church, the community, and I even have a calling. So, feeling this lack of faith and excessive questions within myself now makes me sad, because I wish I could believe the same way I did before, asking for protection, praying for people, all that. 

I think these questions started when I reflected on the Word of Wisdom and the guidance not to drink coffee, smoke, and so on. I wondered exactly why they banned ""hot drinks,"" and all they said was that it was a divine revelation and nothing could be done about it. I've never been very religious, but Christianity has always been present in my life in some way, so this idea of ‚Äã‚Äãobeying without question has never appealed to me. I don't want a religion controlling what I do or don't do if it's not affecting anyone. Of course, I didn't get here just because I was unhappy about not being able to drink coffee, but let's just say that was the beginning of my questions about religion. So I found myself entering the atheist world and reading what these people had to say about their worldviews and how religion has shaped pretty much everything we have today. I don't want to act rashly, but I'd like some guidance on what I can do in this situation I'm in, because thinking about it, I never really believed in all these things. I always had a background of questioning behind it, and only now am I having this ""awakening."" But I can't just leave the church like this; maybe I should stay for a while. Do you have any suggestions on what I can do?",2,1758141089.0,atheism,31,0.58,False

Meanwhile. the 410 foot, 4,732 gross ton American passenger-cargo steamer SS Heredia is en route to New Orleans from Puerto Barrios, Guatemala, with 40,000 stems of bananas and 5,000 bags of coffee. The ship is also carrying eight passengers, six Navy gun crewmen and a crew of 48. While in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico, U-506, a German U-boat, layed its eyes on the Heredia. Just around 2am, the U-boat attacked, U-506 fired 3 torpedoes at the ship, of which all 3 torpedoes hit their target. The ship was now going down. The survivors included seven passengers, one Navy gun crewman and 18 of the ship's crew. One of those crewmen killed was a radio operator, therefore, no distress signal could be sent. The Navy gun crew, because almost all were killed, offered no counter offensive. The only surviving member of the gun crew was blown overboard by the first explosion. There was no time to launch any of the lifeboats or send a distress signal. The few survivors would spend over 18 hours in the water before being rescued. This is the story of the United Fruit Company Cargoliner, Heredia and the rescue of her survivors.

I recommend you check out this book, I thought it was really interesting and is how I discovered this forgotten ship.

1njobaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/OsakaWorldExpo/comments/1njobaf/pavilion_restaurant_tier_list_mega_thread/,Pavilion Restaurant Tier List Mega Thread!,"I've been to the expo for 10 days total (and soon will be going back for another 10). I'm a foodie and the expo was a great place to be able to try foods from lots of different countries in one place, so I went and ate at as many pavilions as I could. Some only had take-out counters, and some had full blown restaurants. There's actually an unbelievable amount of food at the Expo, imported from all over the world!

In the spirit of positivity and celebrating each country, I'm going to rate the food by the best things I had there. Atmosphere is my rating for the venue or area around the take-out counter. Value obviously is what you get for your money. I also deduct points for things I will explain in the descriptions.

# Nordic Circle:

    Atmosphere: 5/5
    
    Food: 4/5
    
    Value: 3/5
    
    Total: 12/15

The atmosphere of being on a roof was glorious, there was a nice breeze while I say under the shade of an umbrella at my table, listening to the faint bustling of people walking about on the ground below. The food was pretty good, especially the waffle which was served with caviar, cream cheese, and microgreens. Their lox which was served with baby potatoes, mustard, and edible flowers was also a very well balanced and refreshing dish. They had a huge selection of beer - I chose one from Finland. Service was a tad slow while I was there, but it really was no big deal. Staff made sure there was enough seating before letting us up into the restaurant, was quite well organised. I ordered like 4 things lol - expensive but I wanted to try lots of different dishes.

# Colombia:

    Atmosphere: 2/5
    
    Food: 5/5
    
    Value: 4/5
    
    Total: 11/15

I visited this place the most on my trip (probably 4-6 times) for the cheese bread. It's so good and they make it fresh behind the counter. It's not a restaurant, but there are seats just outside if you want to sit. They also have a rice dish is also very good, but the pork skin was a bit hard. For dessert they also have two burnt cheesecakes - one normal and one matcha, both are quite good. Great value, good food.

On a final note, their coffee is better than Portugal's next door (sorry Portugal, lol).

# Portugal

    Atmosphere: 3/5
    
    Food: 4/5
    
    Value: 3/5
    
    Total: 10/15

Disclaimer! I didn't eat in the restaurant, just the takeaway window. Of all the pavilions I visited, I think Portugal had the best setup. They had a nice queuing area for the main exhibit, an upper deck from which performers play music into the crowd below, a shop accessible without entering the exhibit, and not one but two food places - a take out counter, and a restaurant. The takeout counter was serving coffee, egg tarts, and fish croquettes.

The fish croquettes were a bit cold, but damn the egg tarts.. When I first went it was the second week, but soon after that people figured out the egg tarts were amazing and they sold out every day by noon. I chatted with the counter lady and she told me she was amazed at how well they sold and had to ask for larger shipments.

# Luxembourg

    Food: 5/5
    
    Value: 5/5
    
    Deductions: 3
    
    Total: 12/15

I deducted points because when I tried to come back to this restaurant on my second trip, they said I had to go through the exhibit first. Now let's talk about why I wanted to come back and eat here (:

The restaurant is a courtyard with a bunch of modern tables, under the shelter of a big canopy. There's a nine-pin blowing lane in the back, which is apparently what they play in Luxembourg. They have two counters - one for food and one for beer. The beer is served in a glass from the tap, very good, and super refreshing. I ordered both the sausage and roast beef sandwiches. The bread they used for the sandwiches is like a flavorful baguette, but very soft, The sausage sandwich was served with mustard and a potato cake, and while that was good the roast beef was so much better. The roast beef was served cold with dollops of horse radish and garnished with chives - this was so so good. The beef was tender and easy to bite through. The man working the counter told me that this is a popular food served at festivals and concerts, and I can see why. This was a very chill and delicious lunch.

# Azerbaijan

    Atmosphere: 5/5
    
    Food: 3/5
    
    Value: 2/5
    
    Deductions: 1
    
    Total: 9/15

First off, I visited this on my first trip, and I think they didn't expect their pavilion to be popular because they ran out of all the ingredients to make the Azerbaijani desserts, hence the deduction. They had a nice Azerbaijani tea though, and that was really nice to have while looking at the view. The venue was a really nicely decorated cafe on the top floor of their pavilion, and the building itself has this triangular mesh exterior, which means sitting by the window you can look out and down at all the expo visitors walking around exploring as you sip your tea. It was quite tranquil.

# Germany

    Food: 5/5
    
    Value: 4/5
    
    Total: 13/15

Germany built a full on restaurant. Like, a proper one and they flew in a full staff over from Germany.  The dishes were big, the food was plated well, and it was delicious. I had 5 dishes and a mug of beer. The soft cheese salad starter which was very light, tangy, and fresh. The best thing though was the fried fish. My goodness, I was surprised by how good that was - the fish was moist and flaky, the batter was perfectly crisp, and it was served with potatoes, kraut, and a really nice thick emulsion based sauce. The venue was bustling, a big round room with plants, benches, regular tables and high tables, and of course, beer on tap. Every wall was a floor to ceiling window so you could see what's going on outside. Germany was an incredibly impressive pavilion - they even brought over plants and grew a garden on the roof with displays explaining their native foliage. The staff are also super nice, I was chatting to a guy telling me how they were proud to represent Germany - seems like a super happy dude.

# France

    Atmosphere: 4/5
    
    Food: 4/5
    
    Value: 2/5
    
    Total: 10/15

France had one of the best pavilions, and the restaurant is on the second floor. They also have a patisserie serving various breads and pastries on the lower floor which I didn't try, but there was a huge queue because it was done by √âric Kayser. The queue moved deceptively quickly. The highlight was definitely the food itself, and they offered a set meal. The beef bourguignon, which was served with all the traditional garnishes was pretty good - the mashed potatoes were really buttery in proper French fashion, and the sauce was very beefy. Personally I liked the cream chicken dish more, but my favorite was the Pate de campagne (which cost extra) served with a salad and mustard. They also gave us some really nice butter for the bread - I'm a fan of good butter. To finish, the set menu had a cheese platter and some cakes, I'm more of a cheese guy and the cheese was quite good, though I wish the portion was a bit bigger.

Overall, a strong entry, but a bit pricy and they were trying to be fancier than the food would allow. To be fair, it's tough to do a proper pop-up fine dining restaurant. Interior design was really swish though, looked modern and elegant which was a consistent theme for the French pavilion.

# Poland

    Atmosphere: 3/5
    
    Food: 3/5
    
    Value: 3/5
    
    Total: 9/15

Poland has a cute little restaurant with two set meals - one vegetarian and one meat. I had the meat, which came with pierogi, bigos, bread with a dill spread, a creamy carrot soup, and some cake. They also had a fruit drink that I believe was Kompot, which they made fresh daily - I'm allergic but it looks really refreshing.

The pierogi was served topped with green onions and bacon. It was good, but not really for me. I much preferred the bigos (hunters stew), which is a spiced cabbage and meat stew - really nice on a cold day. The bread was also surprisingly good, I think I just like dill.

Poland was a pavilion that surprised me - it was designed really well, and you can tell they really put in effort. You can also tell there's a lot of international diplomacy going on there. The staff were friendly and chatty, and the restaurant had a really pretty waitress (she has a boyfriend though).

# Oman

    Atmosphere 2/5
    
    Food: 4/5
    
    Value: 3/5
    
    Deductions: 3
    
    Total: 6/15

Deductions were because there was very little space when waiting/ordering, and there was no where to sit nearby. Oman didn't really serve food, but they served date coffee (dates being one of their major exports). The date coffee was really really good.

# Australia

    Atmosphere: 4/5
    
    Food: 3/5
    
    Value: 3/5
    
    Total: 10/15

They serve **CROCODILE** sandwiches! No kangaroos meat though. The sandwich was a brioche filled with chopped crocodile meat in a mayonnaise based sauce, kind of like a coronation chicken if you've had that, but not curried. The crocodile did taste like chicken. I also had a Four'n Twenty meat pie, which is apparently an Aussie thing. It's a flaky pie filled with gravy and beef, and I personally really liked this. Finally I had a lamington, which is a sponge cake filled with strawberry jam coated in chocolate and coconut shavings. The food was done by Koko cafe, and the Koko coffee was one of the better coffees I had at the expo.

The thing that really elevates this one is the venue, which was basically a bunch of tables surrounding a stage where live music is played throughout the day. I was enjoying an original piece written and performed by a duo of girls while eating my pie, and when they finished I managed to chat with them. Being Aussies, they were extra friendly and the time I spent at the Aussie pavilion just felt really chill, sitting in a cafe on the street in southern Europe type chill.

# Czechia

    Atmosphere: 4/5
    
    Food: 4/5
    
    Value: 3/5
    
    Total: 11/15

Firstly, this is a beer house at the bottom of the building. I really like the decorations, it was artsy which is fitting given that the Czech pavilion is an art gallery. Fun fact, the Czech pavilion was built using Czech cedar and glass made by artisans that they shipped over from Czechia. They also have a beer keg on the roof so you can get beer there too.

The food was good, and done by chef Tomas Reger. Their cutlery, plates, and glasses are all proudly from Czechia, honestly quite impressed by their effort. when I was there the Chlebiczech ran out, so I had the pulled pork bao and potato dumplings. The bao was good but the dumplings were much better. I usually don't like potato dumplings, but theirs were stuffed with smoked pulled pork served on cabbage and topped with a really flavorful sauce and crispy onions. I had two mugs of beer here, one Hladinka and one Mliko, which are different ways to pour a beer to create different amounts of foam. I've never seen this before but I really enjoyed the Mliko, which was almost entirely just beer foam.

I'll return and try the Kulajda, but everything here was pretty good and pretty chill.

# Kuwait

    Total: 11/15

Kuwait built a restaurant on the second floor headed by chef Khaled AlBaker. It's a really nice restaurant with contemporary interior design, and somehow my waiter was Romanian lol. The highlight here was definitely the lamb, it was some of the best lamb I've had (though I don't eat it that often). They also had this deepfried vegetable thing (which I think was falafel?) which was good, but the best bit was definitely the elbah. I've never had elbah before, it's a saffron and vanilla cake thing.

# Africa

    Atmosphere: 3/5
    
    Food: 2/5
    
    Value: 4/5
    
    Total: 9/15

This is a canteen, so the atmosphere and food get a few points knocked off. The interior is nice with sheet metal walls, painted decals, oil drum tables, a music performance area, it's a whole vibe. Very crowded though.

The food was decent, I had a rice dish and a sandwich. the sandwich was a submarine style sandwich filled with spiced chicken and green peppers, served with some fries. The rice dish was definitely better, it was served with a boiled egg and pickled, but the standout thing here is definitely the drinks. All were pretty good and super refreshing.

There was also an African man that seemed like he was some sort of manager wearing a suit with the Osaka Expo mascot pattern on it. Super stylish and cool dude.

# Netherlands

    Value: 4/5

    Total: 9/15

The Netherlands put a small food counter in their souvenir shop, and I had to deduct a point because they wouldn't let me buy a waffle without going through the pavilion.

Now for the positives. Freshly made, hot, stroopwaffles! I've never had these fresh before, only from a packet and my goodness does it make a huge difference. They're made by a big Dutch dude pressing dough balls in a waffle iron, rolled by some Japanese ladies behind the counter. The syrup was molten in a pot, and biting into the waffle resulted in the sugary equivalent of a cheese pull. Had huge cravings for these again hence why I went back but they wouldn't let me into the cafe without going through the exhibit again - do they not want to make boat loads of money? I think they could have been as popular as the Portuguese egg tarts. The value is also really good, like $2 per waffle. They also sold toasties with Dutch cheese, but it was all sold out when I was there.

I sat by the window sipping on wine and eating meat pies and yogurt - a very nice time. The wine was really good (Prokupac 2019), which I suppose is no surprise for Serbia. My favorite things were the meat and cheese pie. It's a layered filo pastry with cheese and meat, quite oily but went really well with the wine. They also had this skinless sausage flatbread sandwich filled with sour cream, and that was also really good. The yogurt came in a pot and was savory; it had cucumber, tomatoes, and dill in the bottom and was actually a really lovely light and refreshing snack.

They sell **camel** milk!! Never had this before so I had to try. It tastes kind of sweet and grassy, actually quite nice. I had the fish which was very meaty, I haven't had much UAE food before so all the flavors were really interesting and new. They have very little seating, and a separate line for take-away, but if you do sit down it smells AMAZING because the pillars in the building are made from date tree wood. Each meal also comes with a date, which is super super sweet.

# Kura Sushi

No rating, but thought I'd mention this because this is something I don't think will ever exist again in a long time. Kura sushi is a conveyor belt sushi chain, and they teamed up with countries to do dishes from (iirc) 60 different countries! So you can order dishes like Belgian waffles, carne asada, moambe chicken, Maldovian donuts, and they come to your table by conveyor belt/train!

Honestly such a unique and fun experience, I had almost 40 dishes here.

# Conclusion

The expo was really good to me, and these were just restaurants run by pavilions - there's even more that are just regular restaurants around the island.

There were also a bunch of countries that didn't have their restaurants ready while I was there, that I intend to visit next week. Including:

* Romania
* Canada
* America
* Turkmenistan
* India

I hope you enjoyed this post! I really should have done this sooner but hopefully this helps a few people over the next few weeks.

I‚Äôm doing my first solo travel to Seoul in late April of 2026! 

Just wanted to see if other solo travellers/anyone else would be in the city around that time and would maybe want to meet up for a coffee or some sightseeing, or if anyone had suggestions on stuff to do, things to see, or places to eat!

I‚Äôm a Canadian girl in her late 20s, and speak English along with basic conversational Korean. I love restaurants and cafes (food in general), museums, sight seeing/exploring, hiking, shopping, night life and karaoke bars (definitely want to experience night life in Seoul, but might be a little daunting on my own) - I‚Äôm kinda down for anything! 

I‚Äôm typically a pretty introverted person so I normally wouldn‚Äôt do this sort of thing, but thought it might be cool to meet some other travelling folks :) 

Trying to step out of comfort zone and expand my horizons!

Thanks!!

1njnzly,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1njnzly/frustrated_and_hopeless_that_what_i_need_for_my/,Frustrated and hopeless that what I need for my ADHD is causing me to bleed now,"So I don't know what happened but I realized I was underdosing myself with my testosterone/estrogen compounded injectible for weeks. I felt fine, maybe had spotting here and there, but had been doing it for maybe over 6 months. I also take phentermine and metformin for weight loss since the GLP-1 meds simply didn't work to take off the near 30 lbs I put on in 2 months when I was on Wellbutrin/Lexapro back in late 2023. Normal exercise didn't do it and caloric deficits weren't doing it - that was a first! So finally phentermine and metformin as a combo was working great at taking the weight off steadily along with helping me focus at work, the phentermine specifically since all other ADHD meds are barred to me at this point or simply make me flat and apathetic. 

I finally dosed myself the proper dose Labor Day weekend. What a mess literally! Triggered a painful period where I actually felt (TMI) stuff and saw these big clots. The doctor suspected unopposed estrogen and told me to up my norendithone in order to stop the bleeding but go back down to my normal dose as soon as the bleeding stopped. It took over a week. Tried to take my phentermine? Have a cup of coffee that I've been having for months, years.... even WORSE cramping and heavier bleeding to the point I'm rushing to the bathroom at work to take tampons and pads. I haven't had periods this bad since even before I started entering perimenopause in late 2022 (which triggered the depressive and anxiety symptoms for which I got the Wellbutrin and Lexapro eventually).

I got labs done, everything in range except the testosterone is slightly elevated and I hadn't injected since that Labor Day. So since my doctor who originally prescribed this injectible (since testosterone creams do nothing for me except cause wild mood swings plus I don't absorb anything through the skin well), is so hard to get an appointment with now, I really don't have anyone managing whether this ratio is even right. I feel I'm getting maybe too much estrogen with this injection if it's triggering painful cramps and bleeding within 2 days. And now I can't even take phentermine or have a strong coffee when before it was fine?? I went back to my reduced dose this past weekend thinking ok I'm just going to go back to what I was doing when everything was fine. Nope! Started bleeding again badly and when I took my phentermine, the cramps were bad again. 

I had an ultrasound back in February and they said my lining was thin so I have no idea where all this clotting is coming from whenever this happens now. I'm afraid that they'll tell me phentermine has to go, the injectible testosterone has to go... I'm in a horrible mood and whenever my estrogen is elevated, I'm borderline suicidal. I've always been estrogen dominant with very low T which is why I started with testosterone injections only in 2014 and have been doing that until perimenopause without a problem. My body is out of whack and I feel everyone from my OBGYN, to that original male doctor who gave me the test/estrogen injectible, to even Midi Health whom I've loved... everyone is guessing. I need the bleeding and cramping to stop, period, and not have to deal with this every time I take my hormones. And of course I can't get an appointment with anyone for weeks, not even my PCP. 

I just don't know what I did to myself but this is horrible to have a period every week that's painful, heavy and clotty. I've just been increasing my norendithone (which is now called Gallifrey by my pharmacist??)  to get the bleeding to stop but that means no more phentermine, no more focus, no more weight loss. I already see the pounds and love handles that finally were disappearing coming back on. I'm just so over life right now. ",2,1758140099.0,Menopause,1,0.76,False

Our mission is simple but critical: provide preparedness education specifically tailored to the Black community's needs. We're talking about real solutions for real people‚Äîwhether you're in a historic neighborhood in Charleston that floods, a mobile home community in Alabama's Tornado Alley, or an urban area in Houston dealing with power grid failures.

This isn't just about individual preparedness‚Äîit's about community resilience. When disaster strikes, we take care of each other. But we need the right information to do it effectively.
