I stopped at a caf√© to grab a coffee, hoping it would give me a small reset.

When I got to the counter, I realized I‚Äôd forgotten my wallet in the car and was about to step out when the person behind me just smiled and said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôve got it.‚Äù They paid for my drink like it was nothing. No hesitation, no need for anything in return.

I tried to insist, but they just said, ‚ÄúPay it forward someday,‚Äù and went on their way.

It wasn‚Äôt the amount of money ‚Äî it was the gesture. In a moment where I felt invisible and overwhelmed, that small act hit me like a wave. Someone saw me. Someone cared. And it reminded me that kindness still exists in the world, even from people who owe you nothing.

We all currently have stable 9-5 jobs with benefits, 401Ks, all of us making well over 6 figure salaries. It would seem foolish to complain about this but we have all been working for ‚Äúthe man‚Äù the last 6-10 years of our lives and are not totally satisfied. We want to do what we are passionate about, own a business with opportunity to scale, and support our local community. 

We have thought about a used enthusiast car dealership, importing JDM cars, opening a performance garage, brokerage, ‚Äúmanufacturing‚Äù and selling aftermarket parts and it all requires so much overhead and risk. Although we are doing well - we are not let‚Äôs spend hundreds of thousands and loan millions of dollars well üòÇ. 

We have all owned / cared for / worked on enthusiast vehicles since the mid 2000s I used to work in a detailing shop in college, my other buddy did detailing as a side gig in college, the other guy is just anal about his cars and keeps them looking immaculate. We are all also mechanically inclined modifying our own cars from basic stuff to bigger turbos and engine swaps. All this to say, we‚Äôre not by any means professionals but we have some experience both outside and under the hood. 

We‚Äôre in a growing city with a population of roughly 1million people and detail garages are by no means hard to come by. Theres even a Bougie big detail garage that people ship their supercars from out of state and back just to have detailed here. 

But we have never seen a mobile detailing gig once. We go to every cars and coffee, almost every weekly / pop up car meet in the area and not once have we seen advertising or anyone showing up for mobile detailing. We all live in nice parts of the city and not once have we seen anyones car getting detailed in their driveway nor at any of our places of work with thousands of cars in the parking lot. It‚Äôs not that they do not exist, I just think the ones that do may not be meeting the market demand or potential. 

I also think younger generations of luxury / enthusiast car buyers will value mobile detailing as they have grown up in an age of Amazon Prime next day delivery and so many on demand services / streaming. There will always be a demand for in shop detailing with ceramic coating, ppf, paint correction but there is no denying that the world has been moving in the direction of on demand services such as the detailing service coming to you instead of driving and dropping of your car to have detailed. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated as we obviously have little insight to what its actually like to own and operate in the mobile detailing industry. Again thank you in advance to anyone who provides info! ",1,1748880705.0,Detailing,0,1.0,False
1l1m2jt,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1l1m2jt/misc_im_lowkey_glad_my_skin_isnt_perfect/,[Misc] I'm low-key glad my skin isn't perfect,"I used to have really bad acne and I used to pick on them constantly so I had a plethora of dark spots which got worse with sun damage but my skin has gotten much better now. I have realized after years that it has so much to do with hormones and diet and that I should use sunscreen. Yes I never used sunscreen before the age of 25 it's embarrassing but it just wasn't something we were taught. I never saw my parents or siblings use it. My dermatologist never once told me all he did was write blood tests and prescribe me oral medication which I refused to take because for the life of me I can't swallow tablets. And I used to live in the middle east a freaking desert climate with sun on my face the whole year lol.

I see so many ppl and obviously skincare products recommend patch testing and what not but I have never once did that in my life. Instead of started slow I start using every product once a day. What's the worse that could happen? I get a pimple lol. Purging lol. I have had such bad skin in the past that nothing fazes me. I've cut down sugar and caffeine and my skin is so much better. Now sometimes I do crave coffee and sweet stuff so I'll have it and expect a pimple to pop up soon but its no big deal. This new moisturizer I bought without any reserach is giving me pimples ok I'll stop and use it as a hand cream or something.

Thankfully though personally I noticed even without using products, overtime my dark spots and acne and sun damage got better naturally so my skin issues aren't permanent its just skin it'll heal itself. I bought a bunch of random skincare products with good reviews on amazon and created a routine and stuck to it and my skin is 1000% better than what it was 2 years ago. I wish I could say I did more research on skincare ingredients but I didn't I just slapped that stuff on my face lol. But seriously paulas choice's bha exfoliant toner thing is the real deal it alone fixed 99% of my skin issues.

So I can't even imagine like if all my skin issues go away today and I magically have spotless amazing clear skin I would be terrified of trying new makeup and new skincare. I would be constantly paranoid about what I'm eating, touching my face, how clean my makeup brushes are, checking ingredient list of every products I use on my skin etc. Sometimes I'm lazy and I'll forget to use sunscreen or I'll sleep with my makeup on but its fine because I used to that shit everyday so nothing I can do now is worse than what I used to do before.

1l1m032,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1l1m032/navigating_through_am_process_on_matrimonial_apps/,Navigating through AM process on Matrimonial apps 4 Females,"Hi All

this is in continuation for the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1l0nyo2/navigating_through_am_process_on_matrimonial/). But this is for Females.

Disclaimer - Applicable only for lower middle class and middle class families. Being from the lower middle class background, I don't know how upper middle class and rich families marry.

Who am I to give advice to females? --> As  a guy who had helped his own Dad and Uncles to search and get married off his sister, cousin - I can qualify for this. 

  
PS --> I value equality in true sense but I strongly believe in Patriarchy. So, Feminists who only believe in Male bashing - Please ignore - I don't have any intentions of gender wars. this is dedicated for females who believe in marriage, family. I neither support all the males on the planet nor I am a simp to tolerate any bs from females.

Bio part --> Same as the post.

Pics --> Please upload 4-5 pics in modest formal attires.  (with visibility settings only for accepted members or those who send show pics request.)

Contact details --> DO NOT put your own contact/insta/mail or any id. Include the contact details of your parents. But ensure you have the login details of your profile and you are handling the profile along with your parents.

Filters -->

1. Age --> A female maturity levels will never match with the maturity levels of the guys of the same age. So, imho - Always apply for X+Y age where X is your age and 2<=Y<=5. Beyond 5, some gen gap thoughts will creep in. So, don't go beyond that. (Outliers exist)
2. Height --> Indian Males are short not because of genetics but we are living in extremely bad env factors, eating highly adulterated foods. Most of the second gen Indian kids over here (in EU) are easily touching >=175cm heights (even those whose dads are only 164 cms tall). So go for 165 cm onwards (but if you yourself are 170cm - then go for >= 170cms)
3. Salary --> ""Pyar se pet nahi bharta aur ghar chalta hai"" -->  (Just ensure that his salary his enough to live a modest lifestyle in whatever part of the Earth you are living. If you are earning too, include 30-40% of the expenses from your income - compensate for 10-20% more in the household help -> guy will be more than happy with this).
4. Caste/religion/location - As per your criteria.

  
Now, you don't need to send the request to the guys. Only in extreme cases if you like their profile, send the request (but in this case, understand that the guy will have upper hand).

As soon as you have made your profile, you will be bombarded with the requests from different profiles in the men. That's why filters are necessary.

1. Read the profile of the guys thoroughly. If they don't match your filtering criteria/ preferences - Reject immediately. DO NOT put anyone on hold.
2. If the guy messages on the contact provided, ask your parents to call him and talk. DO NOT be part of the conversation but be near to your parents. If you are living in different city, ask them how it went afterwards. Your parents should contact the guy parents afterwards and discuss.
3. if the guy insists on talking with you. Setup a time beforehand. Call directly first - No whatsapp video call - This should be the 2nd and 3rd convo. Prepare a list of what you want to ask and be blunt open, talk. second call should be video call. In the call, talk formally and if the guy asks about your ""past"" - be honest and tell. There is nothing you will get by hiding (You might have seen the posts from females where the guy broke the roka afterwards. So, it is better to reveal everything. Honesty in marriage alliance is must)
4. If the guy asks for sexting/nudes -inform this to his parents - block his profile - report on the matrimonial site about this and move on.
5. Due Diligence -> Ask your parents to meet the guy first. I had personally travelled more than 2k kms to meet my now brother-in-law (I would have been visited Mariana Trench or Everest if he worked there). See him face to face in his natural habitat. Check his offer letter/salary slips (hiding PII) - No offense to guys but some of the dudes had mentioned highly inflated salaries / designation. There is no need for dishonesty. 
6. If the guy is in the same city as yours - you can meet. Meet in some proper public place for tea/coffee/light snacks - Not for breakfast/lunch/dinner or in any hotel. DO NOT get intimate as some of the ladies on this channel had posted ""Guy was sending mixed signal and we got intimate"". You are not looking for hookups but for marriage. If you are looking for hookups - delete the matrimonial profile immediately.
7. After first meeting with the guy, your parents should visit the Guy's parents in their hometown. Take your kundli for Kundli milan too (If his family is ok with not matching Kundli, even then take it).
8. Fix up a date and ask all of the family members to meet including the presence of both prospective alliance. 
9. If they are asking for more than 4 months time - Ignore the profile and look for other prospects.
10. Dowry - totally depends upon your family. imo - DO NOT consider this. Go for simple marriages not the ""insta"" marriages. Weddings are not expensive - People make it more expensive by including more show off stuffs. 
11. Scammers - DO NOT give any money to anyone (You might have watched how some of the females were scammed in marriage proposals on amazon prime).
12. DO NOT develop feelings/attachments/emotions for the guy before marriage or in some cases till engagement where you are sure that engagement will not break.
13. timeline - as mentioned in the ""Post"". 4 months till engagement and max 11 months till marriage.
14. In the meanwhile concentrate on your own education/hobbies/health. Do yoga and eat healthy. 

  
No females should spend more than 1 year on matrimonial profiles.   
If you think, I will wait for some ""Prince charming"", ""knight in shining armor"", ""someone who will sweep me off my feet"" - you will keep waiting.   
Just ensure that the guy is meeting your preferences. 

  
Feel free to DM if you have any doubts.

Searching marriage prospects is very tiring but worth the effort once you are married with your preferred partner.

Just like ""worst case"" is considered before any project, consider the worst case of the life and then ask him whether he will face it with you or not. If the guy stands tall holding your hands in the worst case - close your eyes and Marry him. (Not a filmy dialogue )

Financial status is always the case which females consider. But consider the case where you are entering the house after you married him - first step in the new house together, first car together, first settlement in foreign soil together --> All these will bring you more happiness rather than the Guy having everything beforehand.

Happy searching.

1l1m01f,https://www.reddit.com/r/coursera/comments/1l1m01f/dont_buy_coursera_professional_certificatesdo/,Don't Buy Coursera Professional Certificates‚ÄîDo This Instead!,"Hey everyone,

If you're planning to purchase any professional certificates or specialization programs on Coursera, I‚Äôve got a great deal for you that can help you save a good amount of money.

Right now, Coursera is offering [40% off on a 3-month Coursera Plus subscription](https://imp.i384100.net/c/3542565/2907539/14726), which gives you access to all professional certificates, specialization programs, guided projects, and more.

With this deal, you‚Äôll pay **just $35 per month** for three consecutive months, totaling $105 for three months of unlimited access. In comparison, purchasing a single program on Coursera usually costs around $49 per month, so this offer gives you a total savings of about $40 (or more, depending on how many programs you take).

**But it's not just about the savings. here is why the deal is worth considering:**

* **Switch between programs anytime:** Unlike buying a single certificate (where you‚Äôre locked in), Coursera Plus allows you to start a course like Google Data Analytics, and if you find it too basic, you can switch to something more advanced, like Advanced Data Analytics, at no extra cost.
* **Enroll in multiple programs at once:** Perfect for learners interested in multiple topics. You can take courses from different domains simultaneously.
* **Experience Coursera Plus at a lower cost:** This offer is a low-commitment way to try Coursera Plus and see if it suits your long-term learning goals.

**A few things to keep in mind:**

1. You‚Äôll need to complete your learning within 3 months to get the most value. From the 4th month, unless canceled, the subscription auto-renews at the regular price of **$59/month**.
2. Long-term learners may find the annual plan more affordable. The regular Coursera Plus annual plan costs **$399/year**, which breaks down to about **$33.25/month**. If you're committed to ongoing learning, it's worth considering‚Äîor waiting for annual promotions.
3. Cancelation issues: Although cancellation should be easy, some users have reported difficulties with unsubscribing and being charged again. To avoid this, I recommend removing your card or turning off auto-pay immediately after subscribing.

**Final Thoughts:**

Overall, this 40% off deal on Coursera Plus is a great option if you‚Äôre looking to complete a certificate program in the next 3 months or want to explore Coursera Plus before committing long term.

If you‚Äôre planning to pursue multiple certificates and are sure Coursera Plus is right for you, I‚Äôd recommend **waiting for an annual discount**, which Coursera offers from time to time.

Feel free to DM me if you‚Äôre looking for the latest Coursera Plus annual discounts‚ÄîI‚Äôll keep you posted as soon as a new deal is available.

Happy Learning :)

Result: Unfortunately i did not get any pics, maybe next time BUT, the coffee was heavenly, smooth & rich in texture and taste. Added some jaggery powder and BAM! Instant nirvana!

I apologize for the inconvenience.]

I spent every morning for a few weeks waking up on the dusty ground around the well. Those waking moments were the least drunk I'd be during those times. Every sunrise would bring a short period of time when I'd be confronted with the vibrant memory of my brother going over the side of the well. I could almost hear the sounds of feral mastication, every meaty crunch of bones cracking beneath ragged flesh echoing in my mind. I'd push myself up, look down at the empty bottle in my hand, and go inside to resume drinking.

I used to look at the farmhouse as a happy memory. I could still picture Danny and I running around the corn fields and my mother happily watching over us from the porch with our grandparents standing behind her. That happy place had become nothing more to me than a massive tombstone rising up from the ground now. Every step to my front door was haunted by the knowledge of what composed the foundations of this place. The happy memories I once held so dear had been buried alongside so many others within the mass grave I had come to live upon.

Some nights, I'd stumble out into the field, the path to the well lit by the moon like a beacon guiding me into Hell. I'd approach that profane altar and stand poised upon its lip. I'd walk around the edges, bottle in hand while hoping my foot would slip. I'd fantasize about going over the edge only for everything to stop. No more pain. No more shame. I'd balance on a single leg and take a long drink from the bottle of liquor in my hand. I'd drink until the dreamless sleep that I hoped death would be like would overtake me. Then, I'd wake up on the ground, preparing to do it all over again.

This continued, until I woke up before the sunrise one morning, pushed myself up, looked at the empty bottle, then noticed the old man watching me while leaning against that damn well.

‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù I croaked with a half wave before pushing myself up to my feet.

The old man lifted his hand to acknowledge my wave and I got a good look at him. He was large, but not fat, just very broad all around. His ruddy skin was a testament to years spent toiling in fields living the life of a farmhand. He was wearing a flannel shirt buttoned up to his neck as well as a leather jacket over it and faded blue jeans held up by a worn, brown leather belt. I held my hand out as he approached to greet him, and as he gripped my hand, I could feel the myriad of calluses covering his palms like armor.

‚ÄúGood to meet you, Chester,‚Äù he rumbled, his voice much deeper than I had thought it'd be. ‚ÄúYour grandfather told me a lot about you. Sorry to hear he's gone. I'm Otto, your neighbor to the East.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou knew my grandfather?‚Äù I asked dumbly.

‚ÄúYea, I'd look after the well for him now and again. Don't look so shocked, most of us older folk here know about it. We got to be pretty good friends a while back, talked about our families and such. I'm gonna miss him quite a lot.‚Äù

He looked at me and I almost couldn't meet those sky-blue orbs that penetrated right through any facade of nonchalance I could erect. When I finally did force myself to meet his gaze, I couldn't hold it for longer than a split-second before having to glance back at the endless sea of corn stalks swaying in the morning breeze.

‚ÄúSomething on your mind, Chester?‚Äù Otto said in a low, soothing baritone.

I fought the tears, feeling pain creeping up the sides of my face from the strain of forcing my stinging eyes to stay open and dry. There was an awkward silence and the wind became the only sound.

‚ÄúNo, it's nothing, but I appreciate you asking,‚Äù I replied in a series of hoarse stutters after a full three seconds had passed.

Otto laid a hand on my shoulder.

‚ÄúI got a nephew like you, about your age too. He always thinks he has to hide what he's going through, like he's embarrassed about it. Yet, in the end, he always opens up to his family. We always help him through it. So don't feel like you have something to gain by keeping your troubles a secret.‚Äù

Maybe it was his kind tone, maybe it was the way he reminded me of Grandpa Silas. Maybe it was the way my head felt like it was going to split in two if I didn't tell someone what was going on. In that moment, I poured out everything to this old man I had only just met. Otto listened too. I told him everything and he let me. The sun was over the horizon by the time I got to the end and finished crying over Daniel's death.

‚ÄúIt took him, Otto. The well. I don't know how to get him back. I don't know how to make it right,‚Äù I whispered shakily while wiping the tears from my dirt covered cheeks onto my dirt covered sleeves.

‚ÄúWhen my nephew was really young, he convinced his parents to adopt this dog he found off the streets. The dog was fairly small and well behaved, so my sister and her husband agreed to hold onto the dog until the owners arrived. It soon became apparent that the dog was pregnant. So when the time came for the puppies, four were born and my nephew was instantly smitten by them. However, he didn't understand that puppies were fragile. He handled one a little rough and broke the poor things neck.‚Äù

The way Otto spoke was hypnotic, the story transfixing me so well that, for a moment, I forgot about my own pains and could only think of the poor dog.

‚ÄúThe dog died immediately, and my nephew was quite distraught. He felt guilty knowing his carelessness had facilitated that tragedy. However, guilt is our mind telling us to act in some way. So I gave him an act to do. I told him that he needed to take care of the other puppies for the rest of their lives. Feed them, walk them, love them. That's how he makes it right. So your brother, you say he has a wife and child? Maybe you can start making it right by helping them.‚Äù

I sniffed back tears and, for the first time in weeks, the weight crushing my chest lifted allowing me to breath. For the first time since Danny went down the well, I felt like I had direction. It wasn't strong enough to be called hope, but it was something. I thanked the old man and gave him a hug.

‚ÄúDon't worry about it, young man. Though, now that you mention it, if I could borrow your tractor, I'll bring it back tomorrow morning.‚Äù

I laughed and said ‚ÄúThat's no problem. So you used to help my grandfather with the well?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yea, I wasn't the only one. There was a whole group of folks that did, at one point. They called themselves the Wishers. Some of the business owners in town are part of them. I don't really know too much about them though, I started helping your grand dad after he stopped allowing them onto his property. I never asked him too many questions about it, but he seemed to have some kind of problem with them.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere are they now?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey're mostly business owners in town. The only one I can remember off hand is Amanda, the lady who owns the bar. The ocean-themed one.‚Äù

I had no idea what he was talking about, but made a mental note of it for the next time I was out there. He then thanked me for loaning him my tractor and I went inside the farmhouse where I could hear the phone ringing.

I picked it up and was greeted by my mother. She had been calling a lot since Danny went missing. Talking to her was always painful, but the idea of her suffering without my support was even worse.

‚ÄúI think I have an idea of what happened to Danny!‚Äù she shouted into the receiver.

Her tone was that peculiar sound of forced elation that can only be born of the desperation lying just beneath it.

‚ÄúOh? What's that mom?‚Äù  
‚ÄúHe always loved camping, right? He'd joke about running off to live in the woods all the time. I think he did it, Chester! He could be out there, in the woods, just taking some time for himself... That's what I like to think, that he's out there and happy, just taking some time for himself before coming home. Do you think that could be where he is?‚Äù

As she talked, her voice became less excited and more dreamy. That is, until she asked for my participation in the delusion. It was a kind of bargaining we do so often with reality, pleading for tragedy to be replaced by compromise. In my mother's case, she could stomach her son going missing, so long as she didn't have to believe he was dead. She asked me in a pleading voice and I couldn't help but think I would do the same as her if I wasn't cursed with having seen exactly what happened to my only brother.

I blinked the tears out of my eyes and hunched over, keeping myself steady by placing a hand against the wall and fighting to stay strong for my mother.

‚ÄúYea, mom. I could definitely see that,‚Äù I said calmly while sitting on the floor and wrapping my arms around my knees that were firmly pressed to my chest.

‚ÄúI had another dream about him last night, you know? I was at the farmhouse, watching you two play around in the corn field. You grandpa Silas was there too, hollering to stay away from the old well. Now grandpa Silas is gone and your brother-‚Äù

Her voice cracked for a moment and I realized that my mother, miles away on the other side of the phone, was being strong for me right now. That realization filled me with such shame that I had to bite my lip to avoid whimpering. I tasted blood by the time I recovered.

‚ÄúIt's okay, mom. He could be out there, sitting by a campfire right now, or fishing. It could be a lot of things. I'm sure he'll turn up,‚Äù I lied.

‚ÄúYou're right, sweetie. Sorry, I just miss him.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do too, mom.‚Äù

That last part was the truth. The fact that we had grown so distant was painful before I had killed him. Knowing that I could never repair that relationship was almost as bad as knowing I had been the one to rob myself of that chance.

After I got off the phone, I crept upstairs and pulled my brother's phone out of my nightstand drawer to look at the lock-screen picture of us as children. It was at that moment that I remembered Otto's advice and texted Sarah. It started with a simple ‚Äúhow're you doing?‚Äù and became a solid stream of conversation. We would recount memories that we'd share with one another about Danny, or talking about how Blake was doing or simply offering support.

Blake looked a lot like his dad in the pictures that Sarah would send me. At twelve years old, every picture of him that Sarah sent me could have been a picture of my brother at that age. It hurt a little to look at those pictures, but it was also comforting. Before I knew it, I was asking Sarah about my nephew pretty often.

At first, it was clear that she was a proud parent, but it slowly became apparent that it was more than that. Blake was her last link in this world to Danny. Blake was the only piece of him left in her life now. So it should come as no surprise that she was becoming increasingly worried as Blake became more withdrawn.

‚ÄúI still don't know what I was thinking, Otto,‚Äù I was saying a few days later, sitting on my front porch drinking coffee with my neighbor while he listened to my woes. ‚ÄúI didn't think she'd actually say yes to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou still haven't told me what you've done,‚Äù Otto grumbled, clearly wanting me to stop holding back and get to the point of my story. ‚ÄúYou said she was saying she was worried about Blake and thought he needed to get a change of scenery for a little bit.‚Äù

‚ÄúYea, and I told her she's always welcome to come over here for a visit!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's actually not a bad idea. This could be your best chance to find some closure. Helping your sister-in-law and your nephew to grieve, well, maybe it can help you with your guilt,‚Äù Otto said slowly in a voice that you could feel as much as hear.

‚ÄúWhat about the well? Isn't it dangerous to have people around it?‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn't your grandfather have you and your brother come to visit all the time as kids? What did he do when you two came over?‚Äù

I actually hadn't thought about this before and was stumped. I never saw him go feed the well when we were visiting. I'd of known, I used to get up and help him with the different jobs to do around the farm every morning, back when I used to want to be a farmer and before I was forced into being one by fate and circumstance. God certainly has a sense of irony.

‚ÄúI have no idea what he did, but you said there was a group of people who used to help him, right? Maybe they would know?‚Äù  
‚ÄúMaybe, but I need to get back to my farm. I'll be back by tomorrow morning to talk if you'd like.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, Otto. I'll talk to you in the morning. You can borrow my tractor if you need to, by the way.‚Äù

Otto gave a smirk and a half wave, then walked down the long driveway towards his land. I figured I'd go into town and get a few things if Sarah was coming over. Truthfully, I didn't feel ready to face the woman I had widowed and the child who's father I had murdered. The mere thought of it made me want to vomit, but that didn't matter. They were hurting and I could help them hurt a little less. It wouldn't bring Danny back, but maybe it could help me hurt a little less too.

I went inside to grab my car keys and was about to leave, relishing the feeling of slight optimism stirring inside me, that small sensation that was whispering in the back of my mind... that maybe... just maybe... life could go on.

That's when I heard the well screaming.



After feeding the well, I was on the road, speeding towards town to do some grocery shopping, load up on feed and enjoy access to the internet for a little while. Trees flew past either side of me as I wound my way towards the small patch of civilization nestled into the rolling fields of farmland.

I knew I was approaching the town when I saw the water tower stretching up on the right side of the road, the town name written across it. Just after the water tower is a huge hill, the town just on the other side of it. When you get to the top of the hill, you can see the little town in its entirety. It's actually a really pretty view and I always hesitate for a moment at the top of the hill, taking in the scene before flying down the asphalt ramp in front of me.

Once in town, I ran my errands, only hesitating in front of the liquor store for a moment before driving on and choosing to be sober for Sarah and Blake's visit. I felt rather proud of myself for that. In fact, I felt so proud, that I decided I deserved to have a few drinks before heading home. Sure, I had some groceries in the car, but I had bought a couple bags of ice to toss over them while I took my time. The hard part was finding a bar. I drove around slowly, keeping a wary eye open and finding nothing. I was about to give up when I turned the corner to see a sign that read ‚ÄúThe Port Hole‚Äù that featured a little tugboat pulling the ‚Äúe‚Äù at the end. I turned in and parked in front of the bar which only had three other cars in the parking lot.

I was walking towards the door while looking up at the sign when I remembered Otto talking about how the only Wisher he could remember was the one that owned a nautical themed bar. What had he said her name was? Amanda.

My hand pushed against worn wood and the door swung open revealing the dark interior inside. I stepped onto the wooden planks of the floor and closed the door behind me, waiting for my eyes to adjust. The life preservers on the walls were the first thing I noticed, along with the anchors and nets and all manner of random things one might associate with a boat. In the center of a the bar was a large ship-wheel, like something out a pirate movie, with the logo of a different beer on each arm of the wheel. The top of the bar was reminiscent of ship railing, and a black haired woman wearing a knee length skirt with a matching red blouse was leaned over it with a cloth to wipe it down. She looked up as I approached, fixing those green eyes onto mine and giving me a smile.

I realized that this must be Amanda, but she looked much younger than I had anticipated. She definitely wasn't that young, but she was no older than forty at the most. I had expected someone my grandfather's age, well into their seventies or eighties. That was the first surprise I received from Amanda.

In those precious few moments I had while walking to the bar, my mind blurred with a series of thoughts. Firstly, Amanda most likely had a falling out with my grandfather, so it would probably be best if I didn't tell her who I was. I could just say that I'm here to move in with my uncle. Wait, who's my uncle? Otto. Otto's my uncle. And I'm just here to get a drink. Should I mention the well? No, not yet. I'll have to do this a few times. Maybe in a week or two of coming up here every other day or so, I'll get close enough to mention it, see how she reacts. I have to get close to her first. Okay, I'll slowly get close to her and then I'll learn her secrets. Wait, I don't have time to-

All that went through my head before I sat down in front of her, deciding that I at least knew to introduce myself as Otto's nephew and could figure out the rest as I went.

‚ÄúHi, Chester, nice to finally meet you,‚Äù she greeted me in a sultry voice that matched her smirk.

Fuck.

‚ÄúGood to meet you as well, uh...‚Äù

‚ÄúMandy. I own the bar here. I heard you had taken over your grandfather's farm,‚Äù she said nonchalantly while wiping a glass and not even looking at me.

She came off as smug and arrogant, as if everything I was doing was both mildly amusing and at risk of becoming boring. I immediately didn't like her. I think that fact that I was also immediately attracted to her made it even worse.

‚ÄúYea, we thought it best to keep the farm in the family,‚Äù I replied with a concerted effort to keep the annoyance I felt from creeping into my voice.

‚ÄúOf course, that farm has been with your family since... well, I think your grandfather's grandfather, or something like that,‚Äù she said while filling up a glass with beer.

‚ÄúYea, something like...‚Äù I said, involuntarily shuddering at the thought of how long this ravenous pit has been tormenting my family.

She sat the beer in front of me and suddenly, I was trying to repress the urge to look down while also fighting not to be lost in those green gems that almost seemed to glow in the dim light of this shit-hole bar.

‚ÄúIt's on the house,‚Äù she said with a wink.

Something told me that while I may not be giving her money for this drink, it was far from free. Still, I was thirsty, and was coming up on the longest I had been sober since my brother's death.

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I muttered and took a drink, trying to pull my mind away from the image of my brother vanishing into the maw of a monster, and instead trying to think of how to broach the subject of the well with her.

‚ÄúSo, you're the new caretaker of the well, huh?‚Äù

Or maybe she'd beat me to it, I thought while trying to keep the look of shock from my face. Those eyes had me fixed in place now, Mandy's black hair softly brushing the counter as she leaned in closer to me. I could hear my heart beating in my ears now, but I forced myself to speak.

‚ÄúYea, I guess so. It still surprises me that so many people here know about it,‚Äù I said, taking another gulp of the beer to calm myself.

‚ÄúIt used to be a lot more than your grandfather who watched over that well...‚Äù she said in a cryptic and conspiratorial whisper that was almost... seductive.

‚ÄúWere you one of the Wishers?‚Äù I whispered.

She smiled and leaned in until her otherworldly eyes were all I could see. She smelled like almonds and honey.

‚ÄúHoney, I was *the* Wisher.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat exactly did *the* Wisher do?‚Äù

She leaned back sharply, giving me the smallest of reprieves before contorting her face in a pouting expression.

‚ÄúWe helped Silas with the well, and in return, we also got to use it.‚Äù

Her tone was vindictively playful. She knew she was giving a starving man breadcrumbs... and not just in terms of information.

‚ÄúWait, use it? I thought it just made the corn grow?‚Äù I replied evenly as my frustration only continued to eat away at me.

She leaned back in towards me again, locking me into her hypnotic gaze once again. She followed this with a wink and tapped her nose three times.

‚ÄúIt can do a lot more than that, Chester... A lot more...‚Äù she whispered, the last part directly into my ear.

I was simultaneously filled with a need to know more and the undeniable sensation that I was nearing an unseen danger. The first feeling won out and I pushed a little further.

‚ÄúMaybe you can help me. I have some family coming for a visit and I couldn't help but realize my grandfather never fed the well while my brother and I were visiting him. How did he do that?‚Äù

I hoped by ignoring that she was flirting with me that she'd stop, but to both my pleasure and my dread, she was undeterred.

‚ÄúThere's ways to keep the well satiated for a while. Of course, everything the well gives must be purchased with flesh. That's why the Wishers came about...‚Äù she continued to whisper, forcing me to lean closer to hear her.

I waited for her to say more, but instead, she let the moment draw out with us face to face like that. It was the closest I had been to a woman in a while, and I couldn't help but wonder how it would feel to kiss her.

‚ÄúDo you think you could teach me more about the well?‚Äù I asked, finally matching her tone and playing her game.

Her lips curled into a full grin and she was whispering in my ear again.

‚ÄúI'd love to, but this isn't a good time. I could always drop by tomorrow morning though, if that's okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds perfect. I'll see you then,‚Äù I whispered back, my heart thumping in my ears.

I finished my drink after that, knocking back the rest in one smooth gulp, and started to head back towards the farm. I was full of the strangest blend of foreboding and anticipation, fearing and yearning to trapped alone with Mandy's surreal gaze.

When I got back home, the sun was setting in the distance, painting the countryside in hues of gold and amber beneath a sky the color of flames. I could see the black silhouette of the well squatting in the field next to the farmhouse, looking like a small temple of dark stones. No, that's not quite it. It looked like a sacrificial altar awaiting the next victim.

The next morning, I woke up to knocking on the door. I wandered down the stairs, pulling on a shirt as I did so. I was expecting Mandy's petite frame standing in the doorway, but when I swung open the door, it was Otto's broad form filling the porch.

‚ÄúGood morning, Chester! Just wanted to check on you and make sure you're were doing okay,‚Äù he said in a voice that one could feel vibrating in their chest.

‚ÄúI'm doing pretty good, though I'm glad you stopped by. I had a question,‚Äù I responded while gesturing for him to come inside.

‚ÄúIf it's about the tractor, I planned to put more gas in it today,‚Äù he said while taking a seat at the kitchen table and looking a little sheepish.

‚ÄúWhat? Never mind, that's not what this is about. Do you remember you mentioning the Wishers? I found Amanda, she said she's teach me more about the well.‚Äù

Otto gave me a serious look.

‚ÄúAre you sure that's a good idea, Ches? Your grandfather seemed to have had some kind of issue with them.‚Äù

‚ÄúBelieve me, I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but this Mandy woman seems to know something. I can't take a chance on Sarah and Blake getting hurt when they come to visit.‚Äù

Otto considered this for a moment and then nodded his head in agreement.

‚ÄúJust be careful, Ches. If anything happens, just know that you can always call on me for help,‚Äù Otto rumbled, standing up as he did so.

‚ÄúThanks, Otto. I'm glad to have you hear. It means a lot.‚Äù

He didn't say a word, just placed a large hand on my shoulder and gave me a knowing smile, then headed out the door.

I wish I could say that I sat down and thought about the risks I had been too stupid to realize that I had been taking, or that I had taken a moment to consider the people I was putting in danger, but I didn't. Instead, I went and shaved and groomed my hair, unable to stop my mind from wandering to Mandy's plump lips and raven hair.

Just as I finished, I heard the sound of tires crunching on the gravel road outside the house and was down the stairs just as the first knock came. I opened the door and grinned like an idiot at the Mandy who was wearing skin tight blue jeans coupled a white dress shirt with the top three buttons left undone.

‚ÄúWow, it looks just the same as it did the last time I saw it...‚Äù she muttered with a far away look on her face as she scanned every inch of the room she was stepping into.

It took me a moment to realize she was talking about the farm which had the strange quality of being seemingly frozen in time.

‚ÄúI thought the same thing too when I got here,‚Äù I muttered absentmindedly while gesturing for her to follow me inside.

We sat at the kitchen table and once again, I was confronted with the honey and almond smell of her perfume. She smiled and leaned forward across the table, fixing me with that supernatural gaze.

‚ÄúSo, you want to know about the well?‚Äù she said with a crooked smile after a moments pause.

‚ÄúI would *love* to know about the well,‚Äù I replied, matching her tone.

‚ÄúWhat do you want more than anything in the world, Chester?‚Äù she asked excitedly.

You, I thought.

‚ÄúTo have my brother back.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd call me Ches.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe well can do a lot of things... Ches,‚Äù she said with a heavy emphasis on my name that made my head spin. ‚ÄúIt's just a matter of what you're willing to pay for it. Flesh is its currency, and the bigger the dream, the more flesh to pay.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does this have to do with keeping the well quiet for a week or two?‚Äù I asked, confused.

She narrowed her eyes and leaned forward a little more, closing the gap between us and making my mind fog over again.

‚ÄúThe well is meant to grant wishes. If you let someone make a big enough wish, the well will go silent for a while. But it has to be a big wish.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, so I throw a few pounds of meat down the well and wish for my brother back. I'll throw a whole cow down there if I have to-‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's not how it works, Ches,‚Äù she said, placing a finger on my lips to shush me. I wanted to be mad about it so bad, but... I was entranced.

‚ÄúThe well doesn't accept dead flesh for this. It needs to be a live human, the younger, the better.‚Äù

My blood ran cold and the spell was broken. I jumped up so fast that I knocked the chair I was sitting in over in the process. The full reality of what she was talking about settled over me, making me feel sick.

‚ÄúAre you suggesting we kill children?!‚Äù I screamed.

Mandy suddenly looked irritated.

‚ÄúDon't be like your grandfather, Ches! Babies die in nature all the time. Don't you realize you could have anything you like? You could have your brother back, you could be rich, you could be young forever! Think you about it! Every dream you've ever had, they can all come true! What kind of price would you pay to have every dream you ever had be a reality?‚Äù

‚ÄúBabies? Mandy, do you hear yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon't be an idiot, Ches. Your grandfather started off with the occasional prisoner in the town jail, but even if he never admitted it, those prisoners got younger and younger each time...‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're lying...‚Äù I stuttered, my words falling flat without the force of conviction behind them.

‚ÄúNo, Ches, I'm not,‚Äù she growled darkly, standing and beginning the step around the table to close the distance between us.

‚ÄúI can't believe that grandpa Silas would be okay with such a thing...‚Äù I heard myself saying, more a plea to my own ears and than any sort of a rebuttal.

‚ÄúChester... you're not thinking about it. You could have *anything* you want. What would you not give to have your brother back?‚Äù

She had slipped back into a seductive and sympathetic whisper, and as much as I hate to admit it, the words found their mark. I looked down at the floor, too ashamed to lift my face any higher as I felt Mandy step in even closer, the smell of almonds and honey enveloping me again.

‚ÄúWhat would I have to do?‚Äù I breathed as I felt her arms slide up and around my neck.

‚ÄúOnly that what you're meant to do,‚Äù I heard her say as her face filled my vision, her ghostly green eyes burrowing into me.

‚ÄúWhat was I meant to do?‚Äù I muttered over the sound of my beating heart.

She leaned in until her lips were brushing my ear and I already knew the words she would utter before they left her mouth.

HIIT pushes glucose into your muscles, improves blood flow to the brain, memory, and cognition. This effectively reverses the effects of a poor night's sleep. 

So, you wake up feeling like you don't have it today, what do you do? 

Immediately do 10 minutes of HIIT. Your interval intensity needs to be at 85% of your maximum heart rate to produce lactate, which is vital because it's lactate that drives this process.  

We've been taught lactate is a bad thing, but it's actually a good thing. Dr. Rhonda Patrick provides an excellent explanation in the video as to how all this works; please watch it. 

Is this easy? I sincerely doubt it. Exercising is the last thing you want to do when sleep-deprived, but if it's important enough that you be sharp that day, it's worth a shot.

Max Workout has a few workouts that might help: Tabata Workout, Solid Purple Workout, and 30-20-10 Method.

If im being totally honest I haven't been on a diet at all on the shots, I just eat basically half or less of what I normally would eat.

Original Story Written by: Jack Boyd

Chapter 1

It‚Äôs strange how the tiniest things can ignite a storm inside a person. Like the radio blaring through heavy traffic, its static crackling in the claustrophobic silence. I won‚Äôt have to listen to my dad‚Äôs complaints about it anymore. Outside the window, the cars inch forward in a sluggish crawl, the city‚Äôs skyline fading behind us. My mom sits beside me, her voice almost a whisper as she hums along, forcing herself to sing‚Äîprobably to drown out the memories of my dad‚Äôs constant silence. Tommy, my little brother, is in the back, fingers flying over the screen playing Roblox, oblivious to the weight of everything. He‚Äôs just about to turn nine, still trying to grasp why Mom and Dad aren‚Äôt together anymore. I don‚Äôt want to spoil his innocence with my own worries. As we edge closer to the outskirts of town, I notice Mom‚Äôs nose scrunching and her hands tightening on the wheel, her knuckles white. This move‚Äîthis new start‚Äîit's a hard road for anyone, especially her.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your charger?‚Äù Tommy asked.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in one of the boxes in the trunk, I think,‚Äù I replied. You would‚Äôve thought I just hurt a dog in front of Tommy the way he reacted.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhy are we moving so far from Dad?! Is he coming with us later?‚Äù Tommy screamed.¬†¬†

‚ÄúNo honey, your dad and I love you very much, but we‚Äôre having a difficult time right now,‚Äù my mom tried to comfort Tommy.¬†¬†

As Tommy was sniffing his tears away, I reached in my pocket and gave him a Chief Wahoo pin. My dad loves Cleveland baseball, and he would always take Tommy to the games. I wish just once he would take me. Giving Tommy that pin reminded him of Dad and brought him just enough comfort to pull himself together.¬†¬†

We‚Äôve been driving for thirty minutes and haven‚Äôt seen a single restaurant or grocery store‚Äîjust a Dollar General and deer crossing signs. That‚Äôs what most of Ohio consisted of outside of the city.¬†¬†

Finally, we pull into our new home, surrounded by woods. It‚Äôs nothing fancy, just a humble three-bedroom, two-story house. We stretch as we get out of the car and just stand, staring, in silence.¬†¬†

Mom broke the silence by saying, ‚ÄúC'mon boys! Let's see your new rooms!‚Äù¬†¬†

It was nice to think that I was finally going to have my own room. Tommy and I had to share a room, and most of the time share a bed. Not because we only had one bed, but because sometimes we heard Mom and Dad fighting, and Tommy would be scared and slip into my bed while I was sleeping.¬†¬†

Breaking free of the trance, I shake my head and grab my bag from the car. I pat Tommy on the back, and we make our way up the old wooden porch. From what I was guessing, I would say this house was built in the 60s‚Äîbased on the house‚Äôs chipping paint, creaky wooden porch, and vintage window curtains. But again, I‚Äôm excited for this new chapter. Well, not really excited, but intrigued.¬†¬†

When Mom finally pushed open the front door, I braced myself for chaos‚Äîbroken furniture, trash strewn across the floor, signs of a hurried abandonment. Instead, I was met with an unnerving stillness. The house felt frozen in time, as if the owners had simply disappeared, leaving everything exactly as it was‚Äîfurniture draped in ghostly layers of dust, curtains hanging limp and yellowed, swaying faintly as if disturbed by an unseen breeze. The stale air clung to my skin, thick with the scent of neglect and forgotten memories. Every step I took echoed unnaturally loud in the oppressive silence, like the house was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.

I help Tommy with his bags as he runs upstairs to see his new room. I throw mine over my shoulder and head up the stairs.¬†*Pop-ching! Pop-ching!*¬†I freeze. These steps‚Äîthey don‚Äôt even creek when I step on them. They‚Ä¶ well, I‚Äôve never heard steps that make that noise.¬†¬†

‚ÄúMom!‚Äù I shout. ‚ÄúWatch what happens when I walk on these steps.‚Äù¬†¬†

*Pop-ching!*¬†As I put my weight on the first step.¬†¬†

‚ÄúHuh, that‚Äôs unique!‚Äù My mom then turns away to continue unpacking boxes. I have a feeling that bothers her too, but she‚Äôs trying to stay positive. So I don‚Äôt say anything either‚ÄîI‚Äôll just have to put up with the odd noise. I‚Äôll have to figure out another way to sneak out at night.¬†¬†

I reach the top of the stairs to see one single hallway where all three bedroom doors meet. I enter the first one to see Tommy looking out the window.¬†¬†

‚ÄúHey buddy, wanna help me unpack your games?‚Äù I ask him.¬†¬†

But he‚Äôs just staring out the window.¬†¬†

‚ÄúTommy?‚Äù I ask again.¬†¬†

‚ÄúOh, sorry, I was looking at that old barn out there,‚Äù he replied.

‚ÄúThe old barn?‚Äù I look outside to see a leaning wooden barn, about half the size of the house. ‚ÄúMaybe we can check it out after we unpack.‚Äù I say, trying to get Tommy to help me.¬†¬†

Like a conductor on stage, Tommy told me where and how exactly he wanted his toys‚Äîhow to face them and what position they should be in.¬†¬†

‚ÄúMy pin!‚Äù Tommy yelled as he frantically checked his pockets.¬†¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll find it. You just had it; it can‚Äôt be far,‚Äù I reassured him.¬†¬†

After scouring his room, I figured it was in the car, when I gave it to him. I walk down the¬†*unique*¬†stairs and go outside. I open the rear passenger door and see it on the floor.¬†¬†

As I close the door, Tommy yells from my bedroom window, ‚ÄúWas it there?!‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúGo Indians!‚Äù I jokingly say as I lift up the pin.¬†¬†

Suddenly, a faint voice sliced through the silence‚Äîdistorted, broken, like a record scratched beyond repair. It was close enough to make my skin crawl, yet distant enough to be dismissed as a neighbor. But I knew better. The voice was warped, fragments of words drifting in and out, echoing with unnatural echo. My mind spun, trying to find sense in the fractured sounds. ‚ÄòDid we even have neighbors?‚Äô I wondered, trembling. ‚ÄòOr is something else here‚Äîsomething that shouldn‚Äôt be?‚Äô The voice‚Äôs strange, broken cadence sent icy shivers down my spine, each word a jagged shard of a nightmare I couldn‚Äôt wake from.¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou moved my bed wrong.‚Äù Tommy instructed me from my bedroom, which broke me out of my deep thoughts.

‚ÄúGet out of my room.‚Äù I plainly say as I walk inside.¬†¬†

Nothing was in my room; I was just tired of getting bossed around by an almost nine-year-old.

Chapter 2

The first night passed, and now the house had a mix of the old furniture from the previous owner and the items we brought. Mom is very happy that she doesn‚Äôt have to buy new couches or lamps, since I know she can‚Äôt afford them.¬†¬†

I decided to crash on the old couch, as I didn‚Äôt get a full night‚Äôs rest. I woke up last night with Tommy asking if he could sleep with me. The old springs groaned loudly beneath me as I plummeted onto the sagging couch, its rusted coils protesting with a squeal.

We really didn‚Äôt bring much furniture‚Äîsince we didn‚Äôt have any‚Äîbut one thing we did bring was the TV. I turned on¬†*The Sopranos*, and before I knew it, I was extremely tired.¬†¬†

I woke up to see Cleveland Baseball on the TV, but Tommy was nowhere to be found. Annoyed, I get up and look for Tommy.¬†*Pop-ching! Pop-ching! Pop-ching!*¬†as I run up the stairs.¬†¬†

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to change the channel, at least be there to watch it!‚Äù I yell as I turn the corner into Tommy‚Äôs room. But he‚Äôs not there.¬†¬†

I walk up to his window and look out into the backyard, where I see him just as he enters the barn. Curious about what Tommy was doing, I head downstairs so I can follow him. I exit the front door and slowly start to make my way to the backyard. At this point, I realize that I never took in the surroundings outside of the house. I glance at the peeling siding and chipped paint, but I don't look at it with disgust. I'm almost in awe that the outside of the house is basically falling apart, yet we find the inside untouched.

*BAM!*¬†‚ÄúWhat the‚Äî?‚Äù As I was looking at the house, I seemed to run into an old dog house. Just like the outside of our home, the dog house has seen better days. It has white siding and a red-painted roof, which is chipping. Right above the entrance, I see a painted-on bone with a name written on it. ‚ÄúSamson,‚Äù I mumble under my breath. No sign of any dog here.

I pick up my pace and jog to the barn. I stop before walking through the open doors of the barn to appreciate how it's still standing, even though it has an impressive lean. ‚ÄúTommy?‚Äù I nervously ask. With no response, I enter the barn. The rusty tools clink softly as I brush past them, their jagged edges catching what little light filtered in. The air inside the barn was thick with the scent of mold, old hay, and decay. I could feel the rough, cold wood of the beams beneath my fingertips and hear the distant drip of water echoing through the stale silence. Straw covers the ground, and there are soggy bales of hay that look like they were placed 40 years ago. A drip of water falls on the bridge of my nose, startling me. I look up to see more sky than roof.

""Tommy, seriously, come on."" My voice edged with impatience as I scanned the barn. Two horse stalls sit against the weathered wood, the first one creaking softly. I hear a faint rustling from inside. ""Dude,"" I say, more sharply now, stepping closer. The gate is closed, but the wood has been rotted thin, gaps opening like broken teeth. I lean in, squinting. There‚Äîan eye glints back at me through the cracks. My stomach tightens. I jump back, slipping on the damp hay sprawled across the ground, and stumble onto the dirt.

I hear a burst of laughter, It‚Äôs Tommy, pushing open the gate with a grin. I glare at him, trying to catch my breath.

""Yeah, real funny,"" I mutter, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou told me to come in here! I heard you call me out here, but I couldn't find you, so I thought we were playing a game. Remember when you said we could explore the barn after we put my things away?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, yeah, I guess I did say that,‚Äù I replied. I rub my eyes and head, feeling a mix of confusion and the aftereffects of the fall.

‚ÄúC'mon, let's go inside,‚Äù I say as I rub his back.

‚ÄúWanna watch baseball with me, Jonathan?!‚Äù Tommy asked me eagerly.

‚ÄúSure, buddy.‚Äù I replied.

Chapter 3

The room was cloaked in darkness, the only sound was my steady breathing and the TV commercials. Despite the silence, a strange comfort washed over me‚Äîthis rare quiet, broken only by distant creaks and the whisper of the wind outside, made me feel like I was finally alone in this haunted place. It's only the second week of being here‚Äîin our new house, in our new life. Not surprisingly, baseball is on the TV. It's not even a live game; it's a rerun. Just having the game on in the background reminds Tommy of Dad. Tommy never saw the side of Dad I saw. He only saw the side that took him to games and bought him a hotdog.

I sit in the old recliner in the living room, next to the couch. I look into the kitchen and see the back door, and notice something odd about it. The back door was a fortress‚Äîno window to see outside, just three heavy locks securing it. The thick, dark wood seemed to absorb the moonlight, leaving the house feeling more like a prison than a home. I wondered who had built it like this‚Äîwhat secrets did those locks hide? Now that I notice that, I realize there are no windows on the ground floor. But who knows what they were thinking when they built this house in the '60s. Maybe it had something to do with the Cold War.

I relax as I watch the rerun alone. Mom was asleep after a long day of work, and Tommy was in his room doing who knows what. What I was most excited about in our new lives was the quiet. You‚Äôd be surprised how stressful it was, living all together‚Äîlistening to Dad try to sneak out with his latest woman, slipping through the kitchen like a thief, while Mom yelled at him from the front door. Sometimes, it was a guy. Over time, you stop reacting. You go numb. Mom fell into that same trap. But thankfully, my aunt helped her break free.

I jolt upright from the chair, gasping, sweat sticking to my skin. I must‚Äôve dozed off. The TV flickers with an old shopping commercial; I switch it off and stand. As I turn toward the stairs, I catch it‚Äîa muffled voice, faint but strange: ‚ÄúWatchhhhhh‚Ä¶ baseball?‚Äù My heart skips. I freeze. That‚Äôs Tommy outside, right? But it doesn‚Äôt sound like him. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs learning to talk again‚Äîmumbling, uncertain, almost like a toddler. I rub my eyes, trying to shake the fog. But I can‚Äôt go check the window‚Äîthere are no windows here.

I wait and wait, but nothing happens. ‚ÄúMaybe Tommy was sleep talking? Or it was still part of my dream,‚Äù I ask myself in my head. I finally decide to head up to my room, so I turn around and go up the stairs. Damn, I totally forgot that we have¬†*unique*¬†stairs. I'll have to try my best to be as quiet and light as possible when I take these steps. I carefully place my foot on the first step.¬†*Pop-ching!*¬†The sound rings out sharply in the silence. My stomach tightens. I freeze, holding my breath. The noise echoes unnaturally loud. I quickly shift my weight against the wall, trying to muffle the sound, but the¬†*Pop-ching!*¬†repeats, each step feeling heavier with dread.

‚ÄúHello? What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù Mom‚Äôs voice is groggy, fogged with exhaustion.

I hang my head, feeling defeated. ‚ÄúSorry, Mom‚ÄîI fell asleep downstairs. Just... tired.‚Äù I hate robbing her of the little sleep she gets lately.

She offers a faint, tired smile. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, honey. I‚Äôll see you in the morning.‚Äù¬†¬†

I force a faint smile and hurriedly climb the creaky stairs.¬†*Pop-ching! Pop-ching!*¬†Each step sounds like a scream in the silent house. I grit my teeth. ‚ÄúWhy do these stupid stairs sing every time I step on them?‚Äù I mutter, my voice edged with irritation.¬† I stumble into my room and collapse onto the bed. The only light filters in through the window‚Äîan icy blue glow from the moon. My body aches from exhaustion, but a faint shiver still runs down my spine from that dream‚ÄîTommy‚Äôs voice echoing strange and distorted. I sit up stiffly, pulling the curtains closed, shutting out the darkness and trying to shake off the unease.

Chapter 4

It‚Äôs been a month since we moved, and today marks the day Tommy‚Äôs been counting down to since we arrived. The day Dad finally takes him to a Cleveland Indians game. From the moment the sun rose, Tommy‚Äôs been bursting with energy‚Äîwearing his Indians jersey and cap, talking nonstop about the game like it‚Äôs the biggest event of his life. Meanwhile, I feel a quiet knot in my stomach‚Äîthis is the day Mom‚Äôs least looked forward to: seeing her ex-husband again.

I don‚Äôt feel much about Dad‚Äîno anger, no warmth. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs a stranger I pass in the hall. And I‚Äôm pretty sure he feels the same. But if Tommy‚Äôs smile can be because of him, then maybe that‚Äôs enough. I slip into the kitchen, peeking around the corner just enough to hear Mom talking softly on the phone. Her voice is calm, but I catch certain words‚Äîher mentioning a date with her ex. I stop, pressing my back against the wall, trying not to make a sound. It‚Äôs almost shocking‚Äîonly a month out of love, and she‚Äôs already talking about dating again? Or maybe she‚Äôd fallen out of love long before she left him. The thought stings, sharper than I expected.

I step outside with Tommy, tossing the ball back and forth beneath the fading late-afternoon sky. The yard is quiet, save for the occasional laugh or thud of the ball. About fifteen minutes in, a strange voice cuts through the stillness: ‚ÄúSamson? Where areee...?‚Äù The words are drawn out, distorted, like they‚Äôre coming from far away, then abruptly cut off with a scratchy, static-like noise.¬†

As I turn to face where the voice came from, the ball hits me in the back of the neck, startling me and breaking the moment.¬†

‚ÄúSorry, Johnathan!‚Äù Tommy yells, his face pale with worry.¬†¬†

I rub the spot where the ball hit, grimacing. ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I say, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúI thought we didn‚Äôt have neighbors around here.‚Äù¬†

Tommy tilts his head, eyes wide. ‚ÄúMaybe they‚Äôre looking for their dog?‚Äù he suggests softly, voice tentative.¬†¬†

I glance in the direction where the old, weathered dog house sits in shadow. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an old dog house back there,‚Äù I murmur, more to myself than him. A chill runs down my spine.¬†¬†

Tommy hesitates, then asks quietly, ‚ÄúShould we go check?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, let‚Äôs go inside,‚Äù I say quickly. I lock the door behind us, the click echoing in the quiet house. The air feels heavier now, shadows stretching across the walls. I flick on the TV, tuning into the game, trying to drown out the strange feeling crawling up my spine. Tommy plops onto the couch, eyes fixed on the screen, while I listen to Mom upstairs‚Äîstill on the phone, her muffled voice drifting down.

I lean closer, catching snippets of her muffled voice upstairs. ‚ÄúI know! Maybe Pink?‚Äù she whispers, her tone tentative.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWell, you know...‚Äù she trails off, voice lowering to a whisper I can barely hear.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWe did have that thing‚Äîwhat, nine years ago?‚Äù The words hang in the air, strange and out of place. My stomach tightens. What are they talking about?¬†¬†

My heart leaps as Tommy suddenly appears beside me, eyes wide. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs nine years ago?‚Äù he asks innocently, but there‚Äôs a hint of curiosity I don‚Äôt like.¬†¬†

I startle, turning sharply. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing? I thought you were watching the game,‚Äù I say, voice tight. Without thinking, I gently but firmly push him onto the couch, trying to mask my rising unease.

I hear the gravel beneath the driveway crunch loudly as a figure appears. Tommy‚Äôs eyes widened with anticipation. Without hesitation, he bolts outside, sprinting toward the battered Chevy parked at the edge of the yard.¬†¬†

‚ÄúDad!‚Äù Tommy shouts, voice full of excitement.

Dad steps out of the car, a wide grin spreading across his face. ‚ÄúTommy, my man! How‚Äôs my little buddy?‚Äù he calls, opening his arms.¬†¬†

Tommy charges forward, launching himself into a hug. Dad ruffles his hair affectionately, a fleeting smile touching his lips‚Äîthough I notice a flicker of something guarded in his eyes.

Dad approaches cautiously, voice hesitant. ‚ÄúHey, Johnathan. How‚Äôs the new house treating you?‚Äù¬†¬†

I shrug, trying to keep my tone neutral. ‚ÄúFine.‚Äù¬†¬†

He glances toward the house, then asks softly, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your mom?‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúUpstairs,‚Äù I reply. He hesitates, then just settles onto the porch steps, watching the house but not going inside.

Suddenly, Dad raises his voice, calling out, ‚ÄúHeather! Heather! Come here!‚Äù His tone is casual but urgent, almost like he‚Äôs calling a lost dog.¬†¬†

From upstairs, I hear Mom‚Äôs voice, soft but wary. ‚ÄúJohn, what is it?‚Äù she calls, peeking around the doorframe.¬†¬†

Dad gestures impatiently. ‚ÄúCome here! Let me see you,‚Äù he insists, voice firm but strained.

‚ÄúBring him back before dark, please. We don‚Äôt have any street lamps down here,‚Äù Mom says sharply, turning away and heading upstairs.¬†¬†

Dad mutters, ‚ÄúWhat a dump,‚Äù under his breath, then grabs Tommy by the shoulders. They climb into the battered sedan, and as they drive away, I catch Tommy waving at me through the window, a bright smile on his face. I raise my hand in return, forcing a smile of my own. But as soon as the car disappears down the road, that smile slips away, replaced by a heavy silence inside me.

Inside, I find Mom at the dining table, sweeping crumbs into a dustpan. I hesitate, then speak. ‚ÄúMom, we heard that voice outside. It was weird‚Äîkind of scratchy, like it was far away but close at the same time.‚Äù¬†¬†

She looks up, brushing her hair back. ‚ÄúMaybe it was just some hikers passing by. Could you put this box of your school papers downstairs?‚Äù she asks, her tone trying to sound casual but distracted.

As I descend into the basement, an eerie silence replaces the usual creaks and groans of the old stairs. These steps are older, more fragile, and strangely quiet‚Äîalmost unnerving. I set the box down in a convenient corner, then turn back.¬†¬†

Jackpot. An old cardboard box with ‚ÄúMemorabilia‚Äù written in Sharpie across the top. I sift through it, finding faded photographs and a few worn diaries. I pull out one, flipping through the pages‚Äînothing exciting, just scribbles and memories. Since I left my PS4 at Dad‚Äôs, this will have to do for passing the time.

I climb back up the creaking stairs, glancing at the quiet, aged steps. Something about them bugs me‚Äîtheir silence, the way they seem so different from the loud, protesting steps I remember. I decide to figure out why the stairs going upstairs are so loud. I toss the diary onto the rickety coffee table, then head toward the small closet beneath the stairs. No light inside‚Äîjust darkness. I fumble for my flashlight, flick it on, and the beam cuts through the gloom. My breath catches as I see what‚Äôs inside.

I kneel beneath the staircase, heart pounding. Tiny, almost invisible mechanisms are embedded just beneath each step‚Äîan intricate web of thin wires snaking across the wood. They‚Äôre connected to a small, rusted bell mounted on the wall, its surface mottled with age. My fingers tremble as I trace the delicate wires, realizing someone went to great lengths to set this trap. The faint metallic ping of the bell echoes softly in the silence, like a warning whisper.¬†¬†

It‚Äôs no accident that these stairs don‚Äôt creak‚Äîevery wire, every trigger, is carefully wired, a sinister alarm system designed to alert someone‚Äîor something‚Äîwhen I move. A cold shiver runs down my spine. Why? To wake the house when I sleep downstairs? To keep watch over me? My mind spirals with questions, each more unsettling than the last.

I rise slowly, my mind racing with everything I‚Äôve just uncovered. I head upstairs, intending to tell Mom, but her muffled voice drifts down‚Äîshe‚Äôs on the phone again, talking with her friend. I hesitate, listening for a moment, then decide to wait until she‚Äôs finished.¬†¬†

Reluctantly, I go back downstairs, the house eerily quiet. I grab the old diary from the corner, settle onto the couch, and try to steady my nerves.",3,1748879718.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1. I was out to coffee with a male friend of mine. We ordered drinks and I was totally shocked by what they put on my cup. The coffee company has paired up with a local gender clinic of sorts. They are advertising...literally...HRT shots and therapy on the coffee cup sleeve. It also advertises hair removal/laser and the like on the same sleeve. Both of us ordered drinks, but guess who they gave the sleeved cup to? Not my male guest. Either way...the advertisements gravely concerned me. Why is HRT being adverised this way, and why is it suddenly available to the public in my area? 


2. I have breast health issues so I've had early mammogram study and ultrasound a few times. During my last mammo/ultrasound appointment the nurse broke down in the rooma little bit. She told me that she has been getting trans patients in the clinic. She said they always try to guilt trip her for being someone who focuses on womens health. She says during the exams, some trans women make her really uncomfortable the way they talk about their bodies. She also said they claim to have periods. She said its always complicated trying to have these discussions in a professional manner, and that it has added extra stress to her job. She felt unsupported by her superior's on how exactly to have these conversations in a delicate manner, felt backed into a corner and fearful of losing her career if she said one wrong thing.

The diner of choice was just off the nearby highway and the walk there, while loud due to car traffic, was pleasant enough. The two women did not talk as they walked, but there was no air of awkwardness between them.

When they arrived at the restaurant, they found it half full and Olivia was forced to watch as Naomi prompted the waitresses to let them sit in the closed off side of the establishment. After promising a large tip for the waitstaff if allowed to sit out of view of the front door, windows and other patrons, they were finally led to a small booth near an exit. The location was not optimal and Olivia could see why the waitresses didn‚Äôt want to have to walk over here from the kitchen on the other side of the building.

‚ÄúSorry about that,‚Äù Naomi said after they had put their orders in with a woman who seemed far too old for this line of work. ‚ÄúWe just can‚Äôt speak openly if we‚Äôre surrounded by bored housewives and nosey seniors.‚Äù

‚ÄúPerfectly fine,‚Äù Olivia said.¬†

Sheridan's wife who is not his wife is back but it's actually Bruce boxlightener's then wife So there's layers here. 

Turns out she's a shadow. Or Shadow agent I guess. They figured that out pretty quickly, though they don't tell the audience immediately. They let viewers think that John is overly emotional and going with his fake wife to Z'ha'dum Because he thinks he can rescue her. 

It's only the last third of the episode where we see that Steven had run a test on scars on the back of her neck which correspond to Shadow ships. 

That so I do like that reveal. In the context of the episode, the character of John does know what's going on. But for the sake of the drama and the writing, we don't know that he knows that she's evil yet. We just think he's been swept off his feet by seeing her. 

I love the message he gives to Delenn near the end that admitting that he does love her. Woohoo! 

So Mr. Morden and the council of creepy people are on Z'ha'dum. One really overly sweet old guy too. 

Trying to explain what the shadows are, and trying to fit themselves as the so-called good guys. 

The explanation of the shadows and the vorlons. I'm not sure I buy it. I'm not sure I like it either. It felt very DC the Lords of Chaos and Order (Dr. Fate is one of them) anyway, not sure I buy it. Not sure I like it. I'm kind of hoping that's just the shadows making crap up. Because it feels a little too easy: oh yeah, we were actually created by whatever made the universe to bring Order and Chaos and balance the scales. 

Either way Sheridan isn't buying it, and eventually leaps to his supposed death over the rim of a pit. But not before the white star blows up the shadow planet. 

Speaking of the Shadow planet, Babylon 5 is surrounded and about to be destroyed. And then the shadows decide: ""Oh it's time for a coffee break. Even evil needs their caffeine.""

Yes I know it's the planet blowing up there responding to. But I did have a bit of a chuckle there. 

I hope this isn't where the War ends. Not to say that it's anticlimactic. I I just want to see more. And the explanation the shadows gave, again feels a little... Unsatisfying. Which I'm hoping is just because they were doing PR and trying to get Sheridan onside.

Speaking of other things, Garibaldi has been captured. That's not good. Is he going to become one of those CPUs? 

I can see how this would be infuriating for people who are watching it during the actual airing dates. You have to wait a whole year. Doesn't that suck. 

Hey, guess what?! I've got the whole thing on streaming. I can watch the next one right now. Suckers! üòúü§£

Anyway, really excited for the next season. I'm curious to see where they take it. I do hope we see more of the war and that's not just the end of it there. That's my biggest concern. I want to see some big clash between the vorlons and the humans and the shadows. And I don't particularly still trust the vorlons either.

We've had the new ambassador Kosh but we haven't seen but one episode with him in it. Where did he go? 

Well that's about all I can think of right now. I will get on to season four, probably in the coming week",3,1748879560.0,babylon5,4,1.0,False

Hi all,

I'm a 25 YOF recent grad, newly moved from Boston to Burlington. I‚Äôm looking for a kind neighbor in the area who might be able to help me buy my first car in VT. In fact, I am a foreigner, so I am completely unfamiliar with the car buying process in the US, and I have only a few months of driving experience from Korea, so I don't really know what to look for in a car (i.e. engine, tire conditions, oil, etc.).

Unfortunately, I'm a complete stranger to this city, so I don't have anyone to go with me when I'm buying the car. I feel extremely anxious about negotiating or getting scammed, as I've heard a lot of horror stories about dealers ripping off ignorant customers.

So far I tried to prepare myself by searching Cars.com, Carfax.com, Autotraders, CarGurus, etc., and came up with a list of vehicles I want to go see with some strict criteria I've filtered them with.

However, if I could hopefully get a credible and kind person to help me go see the cars with me, I would tremendously appreciate it. Of course, I would compensate with a gift card or a snack and a coffee, etc., to show my gratitude.

I also understand it might be dangerous to meet a stranger from the internet, but I am genuinely desperate to seek at least some advice or a companion. If you're willing, we can do a quick FaceTime call before meeting up to confirm identity for the safety of both of us.

Thanks and please reach out to me via comments or DM! Also, let me know if anything about my post is inappropriate to the VT Reddit community guidelines.",2,1748879534.0,vermont,0,1.0,False

We bonded over the shared interests and she was the first new person in years i felt really comfortable with to the point that i lowered all my shields and was completely open. At some point I even felt like I didn't deserve her.

**CONTEXT**

I have always been a big giver and people were often using me and big part of my school friendships were pretty one sided and i didn't expect anything back, but it would be nice for someone to show they care once in a while and even walk me to the bus stop or something. But whatever,  not the point of the story.

Ok, so let's say Kelly (fake name for my friend), she has always been generous and I don't mean like only money. I have been super busy with two jobs and she often reached to me first which was refreshing and so lovely. She would be taking me out for dinner or for a party and she would make an effort to plan this entirely and pay as also would I the other days I planned our evenings or afternoons. I couldn't believe I found someone who would care this much and give me so much of their time and energy, I really thought I finally found a friend I was praying for years. Also she would always take me home from our getaways and that was super cute.

I really felt appreciated and that was an amazing feeling. She would even come to meto  just hang when I had a bad day. I loved that I could be 100% myself with her. (I am pretty chill and easy-going and people usually feel comfortable with me as I judge very rarely, but it's har for me to really feel comfortable with people)

We were planning on spending valentines together since we were both single, but we both got sick so I just sent her flowers and called her to at least spend time like this. It was super nice. She also brought me flowers when we met after that and I really felt it was equal care and effort although I somtimes really felt like i didn't deserve it. When she got distressed on our night out I would take care of her, manage her, help in any way I could. When I got distressed on our night out I really felt taken care of as well but also super guilty that she had to manage me, but she made me feel loved and it eased my guilt over time.

**SITUATION(s)**

***But bare with me, cause a lot happened.***

We also have our birthdays two weeks apart, so I planned a weekend (friday-monday) getaway in the middle of that time frame as a gift. I just confirmed if the destinantion would be ok as I planned going abroad and I booked flights, accomodation and insurance just in case. And I wouldn't agree for her to  chip in because you can't pay for your gift, hello. So for our time there as a present for me she booked one day cruise on saturday and an evening cruise (which I was very much looking forward to) with the sunset and amazing views on sunday.

Her birthday came and I really wanted for her to feel loved and appreciated even tho I was working so I called her, made few appreciative stories right after midnight and sent her a massage voucher so she could relax.

Then the time for our trip came and she took us for breakfast, I took us for coffee, then she was nervous about flying so I took her for drinks and took care of her the best I could. I also saw amazing plushie of her favourite animal in duty free store that converts into a neck pillow in her favourite colour so I had to buy it for her. Our plane was delayed so when we finally arrived we were exhausted so we just went across  the street for a dinner, cause we were starving.

Food was amazing, the waiter was cute, outgoing and funny, so the whole experiance was really great. We even got free shots. She was telling me that the waiter is looking at me all the time and that she thinks he likes me and then he actually asked for contact and going out. I was like sure, yolo, and exchanged contacts, but I didn't know about going out because it was our trip (me and Kelly's) so if we wouldn't feel like it or we would have other plans I would simply not go out, whatever.

The next morning we had to wake up super early for the day cruise. We were first and had the best spots and some cool couple sat next to us, it was fun. There were two stops, but it was basically just free time to explore on our own, no info about anything whatsoever. But it was fine. After that stop people that came back before us took out place so we had to sit with other people. It was the table with two couples, one with kid, constantly arguing, and one partey couple. It was fine but super intense. And they all were drinking a lot and Kelly was drinking with them. Now would be a good time to disclose I don't drink alcohol because of the medication I'm taking and I just took singular sips to simply taste, because I have never been in this country.

After the second stop I started to feel really bad, and was just in no shape. It is connected to my condition, long story. Anyway, I told Kelly that I feel really bad and that I want to get out on the stop next to us and not in the main bay where most of the people are going, because I really need to take care of myself. She asked me to go to the main bay because she has an amazing time with these people and we would just uber to our place. I wanted for her to have the best experiance she can on this trip so I complied.

When we finally arrived I asked her to go to our place, but she wanted to go out with the rest of the group and strongly insisted so I went to as I didn't want to leave her alone (we literally never left each other alone ever, no matter what, so I tried to be patient and supportive and also you just cannot argue with people after alcohol.

I'm not gonna go into details how this all went, because this post is already long enough, but the father (from the couple with children) was really aggresive, abusive to the mother and it all ended with death threats and police being called so it was effing embarassing, so much drama and as the father was left alone, I dragged Kelly with me and called us an uber and told him to call his own (my friend was for some reason talking to him) and he followed us to our place instead but it is another long story. It was such a long, messy and tiring day I can't even. Anyway I took Kelly to our room that we were renting and as I started to take care of myself she insisted on going back to that guy and I really didn't have any energy left in me to argue about that so I just focused on myself as she went. Another story I will skip.

Finally she called me and I went downstairs and took her back to our room as she was making plans to meet the rest of the group, but ended up not going since I really didn't wanna go  and besides we were like 14 hours on our feet at that point - and it was probably our first argument ever (she's been also pretty easy-going). Then she had crisis, cried, had some rage fit, cried again. I tried to comfort her, hug her, manage her in any way. I hid her valuables so she wouldn't distroy them. And I understand emotions, I can handle emotions, it didn't scare me even though it was the first time I saw her like that. She was talking mostly about the guy she really likes (really long rant - i think might be important for later), her super problematic ex that is an ultraAH, and that she doesn't want to lose me to this waiter guy (let's call him Sebastian, I think he was like 25 but can't remember, I found that out pretty late and then I didn't really care)

After two-three hours she settled and I got her to go get a shower. She really wanted to forget about her problems and just have some fun I asked if she wants me to ask Sebastian (since I was writing with him every now and then) if he would like to go dancing with us. He did want and he took a friend (let's call him Rob, definitely older than me and gave me an instant ick) with him. They took us to the beach first and after confirming with Kelly she is ok with that and with Rob we just sat there and were talking. I was keeping an eye on Kelly just in case, ofc, but also I talked a lot with Sebastian who was insanely charming and was talking about life, plans, how he graduated music school and he would write a song to me. All cute, all fun and games. But then I really insisted on going dancing, since I really love to dance and it would be more distracting for my friend than sitting with Rob on a beach at night (I really didn't like that guy, sorry).

As they were taking us to the club I told my friend that I actually really liked Sebastian and she was excited and took our pictures in the car and outside the club. Then we went dancing. It was fun. But safety first, when he handed me a drink I had him drink it first (there are many different creeps out there, better safe than drugged i guess). I was dancing with Sebastian and he kissed me. Then I was dancing with Kelly and she said that she really wanted to kiss me and I said ok, yolo. She was surprised but kissed me too (and that was way better imo, but whatever. I don't really feel sexual attraction to girls so) and we were all dancing together, and then Sebastian took me a bit further to dance, but ofc I was still keeping my eye on Kelly, but she seemed to have fun and enjoy herself.

I had to go to the toilet and Sebastian went after me and just waited outside. Kinda weird, but kinda cute, but kinda weird. There was some last girl in the line that he hugged and took pictures with so I was like weird. If I would go out with someone I would probably avoid other guys but whatever. I just chose not to focus on that, maybe it was his friend, who knows. As we went back to the space we were occupying a few minutes earlier both my friend and Rob were GONE. I instantly went on a worried mode and started to frantically look around but couldn't find her. Sebastian said that it's all fine I should just stay with him and she will be ok, but Idk, i don't trust guys that I don't know and it smelled sketchy. I called her, no answer. I texted where she is and she just replied 'ygiukh fighter jhjygkk' so I was super worried at that time already.

So the search time started. I instantly called her after the text I got from her, nothing. Texted her a minute after, no reply. I left Sebastian alone because it actually pissed me off that he kept telling me that it would be all fine. I wouldn't  until I found my friend. But i searched the whole club like fifty times. In the meantime calling her and texting, no answer. I was really scared for her. Then I finally found Rob, but he was alone. And I was so angry. I asked him where she is but he was so drunk he could barely speak. That got me more angry and I was like I better go search for her yet again before I hurt this effin moron.

My anger, my worry just grew and grew with every unanswered call and text, I just began crying with hopelesness because she was really nowhere to be find. I finally called Sebastian and asked him to help me find her and he said he did and they would come to me. So I waited but they didn't come. In the meantime I was calling and texting Kelly, nothing. Then I called Sebastian again and he said for me to wait and they will come but they didn't. At this point I was like wth, is he lying or what. I texted him to pls pls pls help me find her as i am super worried, no reply. I called him again and told him that i won't wait anymore and he better tell me where they are and I'm gonna find them.

And i did find them. As they were having tongues inside each others throats. I already was super angry so  you can imagine it didn't help. I came straight to her and as she wanted to hug me I just said for her not to touch me and I was like ""WTH do you think your doing disappearing, sending me some weird ass text and just not replying and not picking up for almost three hours?! I was really worried"" Kelly, being super cheerful and careless: ""It's okay, nothing happened"", and I just smiled bitterly looking and Sebastian saying ""Sure I saw that, but really, you could have been hurt, rped, kdnapped or mrdered! I was considering calling the police"" and she was so careless I couldn't believe that, completely disregarding all my emotions just saying that everything's fine. I swear I have been this mad only few times in my life. Anyway I just told her to take her purse from Sebastian who was holding it for her and as she was trying to talk some more I just cut her speach with ""NOW!!!"" so she went and she effin jumped into his arms and started kissing again.

Seriously it was too much for me at that point, I just turned around and went few blocks in random direction and then called an uber. I texted Kelly that it was super shtty and I would do anything to find her but she apparently has amazing company that takes care of her and has amazing fun so I'm just going to sleep and I don't care anymore as it's too much. When I arrived it was already morning and I was so exhausted that I forgot to plug my phone and just fell asleep. She couldn't get to our room four hours later but tbh I didn't really care. Her knocking woke me up and I just opened the door for her still mad and as she said soft ""I'm sorry"" I just said that I won't be talking to her and I'm going back to sleep. I woke up pretty late and went to shower. I prepared myself for a quick walk cause i couldn't stay there and asked her to close after me and she wanted to talk, but I really couldn't. I was so hurt and still mad. I came back after three hours and told her she can take me for dinner since we didn't eat anything and then we can talk. She agreed.

I told her that I felt neglected and that my emotions and needs were not important, starting with the day cruise where I really felt bad and needed some rest, but was ignored and stretched thin, also with the disappearing act she did during the party and then just acting like nothing happened even though I was visibly on edge, not even mentioning kissing and sleeping with Sebastian, and then even though I was angry it kinda hurt that she didn't even ask me to go to the evening cruise she bought as a present for me (she just called and cancelled it and told me afterwards). It all sucked and I felt really hurt and still angry.

She told me she drank so much at the cruise because of her ex problems and that I should tell she had issues and that she remembers me telling I feel bad and ill and want to go home, but after that she doesn't remember anything (tho when I mentioned something that happened with the father she corrected me so I don't know if I believe her fully) and then she remembers our party to the point I went to the toilet and she went outside and then she said she doesn't remember anything until waking up at Sebastian's. (but i swear she was normally walking and talking when I confronted her so I don't know) and when she texted me the text with a fighter inside she clearly needed help, someone to fight for her and that's what she meant. (BUT I TRIED TO HELP TO MY EFFIN LIMITS, was it not enough) and then she said that I have a right to be mad and she just could say sorry, but it wouldn't change anything. And then she was talking about how she woke up at his place and he wanted to make her breakfast and walk her to our place and wants to go out with her (I don't know why, it hurt me tbh, but maybe she just wanted to be upfront and honest, but I don't know about anything here anymore, too messed up of a situation)

Anyway, we still had a full monday together. I was not angry anymore, maybe a little inside, but I tried to act civil. She took us for an expensive lunch there and bought me perfumes in the plane (I have a very sensitive sense of smell and I can't with most of the perfumes and didn't like them but took them, wanted to be nice. I took her for dinner back in our country. She took me home. And that would be it. I couldn't wait to leave that stupid place and be back in our country, but here I felt so lonely and that without her there would be something huge missing and I love her so much, but I'm also still hurt and want her to try and just show initiative. But she's pretty much ghosting me. She just texted me a week later that she wishes me my dreams to come true and many adventures I wouldn't regret, super dry, super short, nothing else. I had a shtty bday so I just posted on my ig stories my highlights of my last hear and I posted one whole story of our time together since no matter what happened we really had amazing time during the year. I think that was a subtle reached out hand to her. But she saw that and no reply. She used to reply/react to anything I post (as would I to her), but she's basically been ghosting me ever since. I'm hurt. I miss her. I can't stop thinking about her, because she really became an important person to me.

***So AITAH for ignoring her ex problems, her emotions and actually just her a little bit during events described above and after our trip, focusing on my emotions and myself first or am I gaslighting myself?***

# THE TRANSITION APPARATUS: How Academia Manufactured Identity Crisis to Preserve Social Control

**This manuscript exposes gender transition as a sophisticated social control mechanism disguised as liberation. The core argument:**

**The Manufactured Crisis:** Academic institutions in the 1950s didn't discover gender dysphoria - they created it as a diagnostic category to redirect homosexual nonconformity into medical conformity. Rather than challenge heteronormative structures, they preserved them by converting sexual rebels into managed patients.

**The Programming Process:** Gender dysphoria assessments don't measure pre-existing conditions - they're programming protocols that teach patients to interpret normal developmental confusion as evidence of being ""born in the wrong body."" Therapists actively shape patient experiences through leading questions and transition-compatible frameworks.

**The Reinforcement System:** Once patients accept trans identity, elaborate systems make questioning psychologically impossible. Social media suppresses detransition accounts, medical professionals frame hesitation as internalized transphobia, and community belonging becomes conditional on maintaining transition commitment.

**The Economic Engine:** Transition creates permanent patients requiring lifelong medical dependency - continuous hormones, surgeries, therapy, monitoring. Success is measured by treatment adherence and system expansion, not patient wellbeing.

**The Binary Trap:** Rather than challenging gender stereotypes, transition theory reinforces them by arguing that gender nonconformity indicates ""wrong"" biological sex requiring medical correction. It preserves the assumption that biology should determine behavior while appearing progressive.

**The Final Deception:** Patients experience transition as authentic self-discovery because the apparatus generates that feeling while serving institutional control. The consciousness celebrating liberation is the same consciousness systematically programmed to interpret psychological discomfort through frameworks serving institutional rather than individual interests.

The transition apparatus achieves voluntary submission to experimental procedures through manufactured identity categories that feel authentic while demonstrating perfect institutional compliance.

I only understood and remembered what I had done to myself, after talking to my colleague about it. 
Sorry in advance, English is not my first language. 

It's been a long weekend, and I've spent most of it playing video games and being sick. 
The kind of sick that makes a man whine and my nose and throat to go full tsunami with liquids of different variations of chunkyness. 
I don't have to go in too graphic on the liquids, I guess you've all been there and can feel the texture in you're mouth right about now. 

Yesterday I was one with the couch most of the day. Laying there, switching between the PlayStation and some episode from cops. 
I get the all so familiar need to cough. 
The power takes form in my stomach and from there travel up my belly and through my throat. What crawls out of the dark depths must have seen some things. 
It almost had a heartbeat. 
I need to let this bird free, I think to myself and look around for a suitable place to spit it out. In front of me on the table is my coffee mug.
I'm too lazy to get up from the sofa and I can reach it. Superduper convenient. 

This morning I was in a bit of a rush, but as autistic as I am in need to go through with my morning routine. Drink coffee and shit.

I swosh up the closest mug and rush to the coffee. Then the technology of the kitchen makes me coffee. 
I can then have 5 to 10 min of morning bliss, before my little tummy starts making noises. 

Halfway through the SO necessary routine I feel a weird oily feeling in my mouth. 
It freaks me out a bit cause a couple of weeks back I drank old milk in my coffee and that shit was terrible. 

I look in the mug and of course. It dawns on me. It's the f*cking spit mug. 
Down there on the inside the mug floats what is left of that ol chunk of me, that had dried overnight and turned into illegally good glue. 
I gag in a way I've never gagged before. But I'm in a hurry. Next step on the routine is shitting. 

I stumbled in to the bathroom with red and watery eyes. As I'm polluting freshwater I try to hold one opening of me open for business, and the other closed for the day. I'm struggling. 
I end up late for work aswell...

Julia turned her eyes to the door as an energetic blue mountain charged into the room, followed by the rest of the family. Uncle Kaz¬† ‚Äì not even trying to hide the tears on his own face ‚Äì strode over to Dad, pulled him to his feet, and one mountain wrapped around another in a hug. All three of Aunts joined him, as did both of her cousins. Mom ended up in the middle somehow, and Julia didn‚Äôt want to just stand there, so she piled on herself.

The all stood a while. No one really cried, though no eye stayed dry either. She heard the occasional shuddering breath, or quiet word of commiseration. At length, Uncle Kaz spoke. His voice came out soft, gentle, but with steel behind it, as he recited a prayer for the honored dead, as well as a prayer for those left behind.

That done, everyone found seats. Julia started to hand out drinks, but one of the cousins firmly pushed her to a chair and took over those duties. Uncle Kaz waited until he and Dad had their drinks before he spoke. ‚ÄúYou do know that I nearly held that hand sign up to you, just as Enibal had, and took you as a bond brother myself, right? That the only thing which stopped me was the engagement between him and my niece.‚Äù

Julia blinked several times as Dad managed a wan smile. ‚ÄúI suspected as much, my friend, and I thank you. I know you considered doing it anyway, and might have if not for‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ royal considerations.‚Äù

Uncle Kaz nodded, but Aunt Golna answered. ‚ÄúThat is pretty much it. The four of us discussed it several times, even had one of those avoid-the-subject-while-discussing it with his sister. She gave her blessing, but obviously felt some reservations about it.‚Äù

Dad nodded, took a sip of his drink, and spoke into it. ‚ÄúThank you, all of you. It is good to have that acknowledged, even after all of these years. I was ‚Äì and really still am ‚Äì grateful you didn‚Äôt, though, for I would have accepted‚Ä¶ and I was already having enough issues from certain quarters of my government over it all.

‚ÄúBut, we are now avoiding the principle subject of all of the evening, and I would rather get it over with.‚Äù

Uncle Kaz sat a little straighter,¬† hardened his face a little, and looked Dad square in the eye. ‚ÄúI have already drafted the Full Pardon for you on all counts, with all restrictions to be rescinded immediately. Nothing in the document has anything about what has just been learned, but given how tightly this secret *should* have been kept, I imagine that every Ambassador on this planet is currently calling his government and waking people up, if necessary.‚Äù

The usual joke fell flat, but Kaz just gave a small quirk of a half-smile and continued. ‚ÄúThe only question I have for you is if you‚Äôd like me to call an emergency secession tonight to have it voted on, or if you are willing to wait until tomorrow for a mere special secession?‚Äù

Mom glanced daggers at Uncle Kaz, but turned to Dad and spoke. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt have your convictions overturned or set aside, though. You worked too hard to win that. Also, you know good and well that ‚Äì if The Legend Returns ‚Äì you will never get a moments peace unless we pack ourselves into a ship and sail off to Parts Unknown‚Ä¶ and even then someone might follow us and try to bring you back.‚Äù

A small smile finally came to Dad‚Äôs lips, and he lifted his head a little. He nodded to Mom, and waved a hand at Uncle Kaz. ‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt need to have the conviction overturned. I went over the language of that Punishment Decree on-and-off for years, making sure I had it right. I knew there were some loose ends out here which might ‚Äì just might ‚Äì cause me to be needed on some level in the future. To be honest, when I set the language up, I would never have imagined that those loose ends could be‚Ä¶ would be‚Ä¶‚Äù

A single tear began to form in his eye, but Mom laid a hand on his arm. He swallowed, nodded, took a shuttering breath, then continued. ‚ÄúSuffice it to say that there is a small amount of very narrow wiggle room in there.‚Äù

He paused a moment to hit a few buttons, and text floated over the coffee table, with several passages highlighted. A small part of her mind registered Aunt Yoro leaning forward to examine the words.

Dad started to speak again, but Aunt Yoro shook her head and chuckled a little, then beat him to it. ‚ÄúYou know, Henry, you really should have consulted me on this one. The phrases you used in English have the vagueness you need while still *sounding* specific enough, but‚Ä¶‚Äù

Dad shook his head. ‚ÄúIt would have been suspicious if I had used anything other than English, since it was quite clear who was bringing the decree. Pulling that one off was hard, and I wanted everyone paying attention to what I wanted, not to trying to puzzle out why I‚Äôd write something in a different language.

‚ÄúNo, Yoro, please. I thank you, I really do, for your after-the-fact offer‚Ä¶ But, I think you will find that I did quite well?‚Äù

Julia blinked several times as her Aunt gave a reproving-yet-proud-of-you look that only mothers seemed able to pull off. ‚ÄúOh, yes. I think the passages where you talk about ‚Äòneeds for continuity of government‚Äô and ‚Äòproviding material support through knowledge only possessed by the subject.‚Äô

‚ÄúI am, honestly, astounded how you made it seem like that passage is related to passwords, keys, and other such things, but managed to word it so that you can be called in for‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ nearly anything that ties back to what you were doing and/or absolutely had to have you involved.‚Äù

Dad nodded. ‚ÄúOne of the things intel anticipated was that the Xaltan would refuse to surrender to anyone other than me, personally. I wanted to make very sure I would be able to deal with that without having to get the decree rescinded.‚Äù

Uncle Kaz shook his head and chuckled. ‚ÄúOk, Henry. You pulled an even *more* masterful stroke that day than I thought. You‚Äôve also obviously got something in mind for what you want to do in terms of these Pirates, so lets hear it.‚Äù

Dad shrugged. ‚ÄúI want to be there, in the room, when the first prisoner is interviewed. I want to be part of that interrogation, to look the person in the eye and try to convince them that we did all we could.‚Äù

Dad‚Äôs head then came up, and he speared Uncle Kaz with a hard look. ‚ÄúI also need John the former accountant to be there. I don‚Äôt know why he isn‚Äôt at your side anymore, I honestly haven‚Äôt kept track of him for‚Ä¶ well, I haven‚Äôt. But, like him or not, he has as much right as I do to be part of this if he chooses: And, something tells me that the honor you taught him will mean he will *need* to be there just as much as I do.‚Äù

Uncle Kaz responded with a solemn nod, then a wry smile. ‚ÄúAnd here I thought I was going to have to convince you to let him ‚Äòin‚Äô so to speak. I‚Ä¶ understand your sentiments towards the man, though I do wish you would find it in your heart to forgive what he did back then. At the same time, I respect that you can get past those personal feelings to grant *him* the respect due to the changes he made.

‚ÄúAs for what the man has been doing: I made him a Knight Errant of the Empire a good twenty years ago. He got himself a ship and has been pirate hunting ever since. He is still sworn personally to me, of course, and reports in on the regular.‚Äù Uncle Kaz shook his head and *harrumphed*. ‚ÄúHe started out with a skeleton crew, but has his ship full-to-bursting now; all of 'em pirates he was able to catch an reform.

‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt look at me like that, Henry. He‚Äôs sent most of them to the prisons ‚Äì when he hasn‚Äôt had to just space them outright in combat ‚Äì but he has managed to reform more than I‚Äôd ever have thought possible.‚Äù

Julia felt a moment of‚Ä¶ something she couldn‚Äôt quite place as her Father grimaced, then nodded. A quiet followed, which she decided to fill. ‚ÄúOk, so we have a basic plan of action. How long until John gets here? Or, no, wait. He doesn‚Äôt need to come here, does he? He needs to go‚Ä¶ well, somewhere‚Ä¶‚Äù

Aunt Golna answered. ‚ÄúI can tell you where he *will* go, whether it is what we want him to do or not. When he sees that data he is going to turn his ship directly into the pirate‚Äôs hunting ground and lean into his engines so hard his engineer is going to have nightmares. His crew will follow him, too, straight into the maw of the hells if he decides that is where they need to go.‚Äù

Julia felt her eyebrows draw down at the odd respect in her Aunt‚Äôs words, but it only took a moment of thought for her to understand. *Of course. The man is a good leader able to command fierce loyalty, and that is one of the primary traits she was reared to admire. Though, from what I can remember of his story, there is probably more to it than that.*

A level gaze speared her Father from Aunt Golna as she continued. ‚ÄúThe best thing to do ‚Äì both politically and in practical terms ‚Äì would probably be to have you on that ship with him. But, even putting aside the fact that I know you don‚Äôt want to be on the same ship as the man, even with the respect he‚Äôs won, I know that your dear wife there would not let you go without her‚Ä¶ And I don‚Äôt think my niece will allow the Crown Prince‚Äôs Aunt anywhere near a potential combat situation.

This earned her a hard look from Mom, and gave Julia some mixed feelings. *I am glad that Mom won‚Äôt be going in harm‚Äôs way like that, but also bristle at* anyone *trying to tell her what she can and can‚Äôt do. She changed that crown prince‚Äôs diapers for goodness sakes.*

Kaz held a hand up in response to the flint in Mom‚Äôs eyes, and gave his wife a slightly reproving look. ‚ÄúWhat anyone will or won‚Äôt allow ‚Äì or what anyone would do about it ‚Äì is not what we are here to discuss. And, I think all of us are far too raw, emotionally, to want to tread on that sort of ground, no?‚Äù

Aunt Golna looked slightly abashed, and Mom‚Äôs posture lost its rigidity. Well, some of its rigidity. She started to speak, but Golna beat her to it. ‚ÄúSorry, I didn‚Äôt mean‚Ä¶‚Äù She waved a hand in a gesture of helplessness and apology. ‚ÄúI was trying to lighten the mood, not make a declaration, darling. I know that the Royals and you can be a bit of a touchy subject, I just‚Ä¶ Well, like he said, all of us are a bit raw on the nerves right now, and sometimes when I am this frazzled I forget‚Ä¶‚Äù

This time Mom waved a dismissive hand, a wry grin on her face. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine Golna‚Ä¶ and I know. Heavens and Hells, most days I might have even found the comment funny, or enjoyed sparing with you over it. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶‚Äù She repeated Golna‚Äôs helpless gesture from earlier, then leaned against Dad again.

But dont underestimate those gods, I bet they are super angry right now. So is anyone willing to go next?‚Äù

**Wu Qi, the chinese military general and philosopher, raises an eyebrow.** ‚ÄúYou are asking who shall go next AFTER you tells us our opponent is angry and will strike harder in the upcoming round?‚Äù **He speaks in a collected tone and with a wise aura even though he looks no more than 19 years old.**

‚ÄúI still dont get how you lead armies back on Earth while looking like a teenager‚Ä¶‚Äù **Teases Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, the liberator of South America. He rubs his chin with a devious smirk.**

**Wu Qi frowns, and his aura of authority disappears, he turns at Sim√≥n and raises his fist.** ‚ÄúShut your mouth Bol√≠var! I also dont know why it decided my golden age to be 19!!‚Äù

‚ÄúI shall go next Buddha!‚Äù **Rings out through out the room. The greatest king of Africa, Thutmose III., raises from his seat with a determined look.** ‚ÄúIm confident I will perform well against the gods. For the sake of the future of humanity.‚Äù

**Jan ≈Ωi≈æka, a general from Czechia, nods slowly and crosses his arms.** ‚ÄúTruly honourable sir Thutmose.‚Äù

**Buddha smiles and clasps his hands together.** ‚ÄúGlad to see your enthusiasm Thutmose, you will participate in the second round then.‚Äù

**Elsewhere, in Valhalla, the gods are sitting around a table, arguing.** 

‚ÄúThose humans, they actually have the lead on us!‚Äù **Says Bhaga, crossing his arms and leaning back in his chair with an annoyed frown.**

‚ÄúI told you to not underestimate Bhaga, the human will to survive is massive.‚Äù **Replies Shiva with a smirk.** ‚ÄúBelieve me, I experienced it myself.‚Äù

**Zeus knocks on the table with his hammer to quiet everyone down.** ‚ÄúI can see most of you are angered by the outcome of the first round. I myself am quite angry, such a dirty way to win is unforgivable in the arena. We must pay back, any ideas?‚Äù

**Veles, who somehow found his way to the meeting, slithers up onto the table in his snake form before transforming.** ‚ÄúYooo! Zeus! Let me go next! I can play dirty if thats what you want!‚Äù **He grins excitedly, the horns on his crown so close to Zeus they almost poke him.**

**Zeus raises an eyebrow but then an authoritian voice behind Veles responded, its Perun and he has enough of Veles.** ‚ÄúVeles, you are not a participant in this brawl. Accept this fact and sit down, or leave.‚Äù

**After a bit of quiet Veles slowly gets of the table, with his head down in shame. Huitzilopochtli sighs and stands up.** ‚ÄúLet me go Zeus, Ill even the score.‚Äù

**Suddenly Veles again starts talking, this time his hand is around a shoulder of an another god.** ‚ÄúWait! How about we send Xolotl? He can also play dirty, he told me on our coffee break yesterday.‚Äù

**Xolotl [Aztec Pantheon] turns to Veles with a confused and anxious expression.** ‚ÄúW-We never went on any coffee break tho-‚Äú

**He is cut off by Huitzilopochtli, who laughs.** ‚ÄúXolotl? Thats absurd, that wimp will just embarrass us just like Maui.‚Äù

**Zeus rubs his beard and looks over Xolotl, who carefully steps away from Veles and Huitzilopochtli, he then nods and slams his hammer onto the table again.** ‚ÄúIf its between you, Huitzilopochtli, and Xolotl, lets send him. We will need you, Perun and Yudi for later rounds if we get backed into a corner.‚Äù

**Huitzilopochtli sighs and crosses his arms.** ‚ÄúOkay fine, Ill let Xolotl go.‚Äù **He turns to the god of plagues and frowns, hint of disgust on his face.** ‚ÄúDont you dare disappoint us, or even Niflheim wont save you.‚Äù

**Xolotls slowly turns to Huitzilopochtli with a nod.** ‚ÄúYes sir, Ill do my best.‚Äù

**Buddha is walking towards his VIP booth, snacking on candy.** ‚ÄúConfidence is key to many things, luckily Thutmose has a lot of it.‚Äù **He smirks and enters his booth.** ‚ÄúLets see what this round brings.‚Äù

**Perun silently marches to his booth, Veles walking behind him.** ‚ÄúI hope you chose the right god Veles.‚Äù **Perun finally speaks.** ‚ÄúI hope you understand this brawl is not some joke.‚Äù

**Surprised Veles blinks a few times, not really used to Perun talking to him willingly, before a devilish smirk crosses his features.** ‚ÄúNaaah! Dont worry Perun.‚Äù **He chuckles.** ‚ÄúIm sure I made the perfect pick.‚Äù

**Huitzilopochtli enters a booth and sits down, looking restless. Longshen turns to him and raises an eyebrow.** ‚ÄúWhat seems to be the problem sir Huitzilopochtli?‚Äù

**The aztec god grunts and crosses his arms.** ‚ÄúXolotl better do his very best, if he will mope around like he does all the time Ill go down there and kill the human myself.‚Äù

**Longshen nods and looks into the arena.** ‚ÄúWe shall see how Xolotl will do, Im certain he will do his best.‚Äù

**Aphrodite sighs and leans on her hands against her chair.** ‚ÄúIsnt Xolotl that sick-looking god? Oh geez‚Ä¶I heard humanity will send out some egyptian king.‚Äù

**On the other side of the arena, the human side, the french saint Jeanne enters the booth of Einherjar.** ‚ÄúGood day Jan, have you also came to watch the match?‚Äù **She sits down next to the general, who nods.**

‚ÄúExactly, I hope we keep our momentum from the first round and acquire another victory.‚Äù **Responds ≈Ωi≈æka and drinks his beer.** ‚ÄúI want to see this match in person.‚Äù

I have a 77"" OLED 144Hz Samsung S90D that recently replaced and older 55"" 1080p 60Hz tv. When playing multiplayer shooters, it is good to sit close, so I would put a chair in front of the tv in my living room. Sometimes, I would have a desk setup in front of it as well for keyboard use (when not expecting company lol). Now, with the 77"", that would be too close, but sitting back on the couch is still too far. Sitting in the sweet spot would involve moving my coffee table every time. I did not want to do this, so I setup my desk with the older tv next to it for work/pc gaming (just age of empires lol). I would like to have my ps5 connected to both tvs and switch to the old one when I want to play a multiplayer shooter in order to sit close. Is the device below what I need to do this without compromising the signal quality? Or does anyone have a better recommendation? Can I use any one of these? Can hdmi ports go either way regardless what the manufacturer claims or are they exclusively in or out?

1l1l2cf,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultKids/comments/1l1l2cf/3_years_since_the_big_fight_and_heres_the_story/,3 years since the big fight and here's the story,"It's been almost 3 years since the massive fight I had with my mom and stepdad. I call it the time I blew up my life. But really, it was not my fault. It's taken a lot of working through this guilt. Basically, they were saying some racist nonsense and I called them out on it. They didn't like it, so they freaked out at me. For context, they are both white, I am mixed race Indian. My grandparents immigrated from India and my dad was born in the US. 

Now, the thing they said was not directed at me. They were talking about the Phillippines and how they deserved to be colonized, that colonization was a good thing. And I just, could not. I got so angry and upset. Now this was not the first time they had said racist things, nor was it the first time I had corrected them. I honestly didn't even get to fully articulate what I was upset about because they blew up at me. I have a terrible time with confrontation and was going into it anxiously crying, honestly scared to tell them how I felt. But they just kept saying things that were more unbelievable. And my mom was like, ""We raised you to be better than this, so you hate America?"" When I had said, you know this country is stolen Indigenous land, built off of genocide and slavery? But they made it out like I was the problem, instead of the racist bullshit they were spewing. 

And I could not believe they were trying to tell me colonization was a good thing. Seeing as how the British basically destroyed India and how many people suffered from it. My grandpa and grandma were young when the Partition happened, which was a massive displacement of millions of people, and so much violence and death. To try to tell me it was a good thing that the British and other countries ruined most of the globe, that's a colonizer mentality, and so completely ridiculous. 

Anyway, they gave me the silent treatment for a week. And then, I had a friend come to stay with me for the weekend. She is also mixed race, her dad is Liberian. And she was so excited to meet them. But you know what they did? They were so rude and cold to her, barely even said hello because they were mad at me. They also were angry because according to them, I didn't tell them the day she was coming over and the house was dirty. Which, no. I did tell them the day, they just conveniently forgot or whatever. It wasn't a big deal. But that was no way to treat a guest in our home, someone who is a dear friend of mine. I got more upset.

I had been working with a therapist prior to this and she had given me a worksheet on boundaries. So I used that to write out a thing that again, turned into a huge fight. I will put it below. 

I really said that I felt unsafe, that I wanted them to educate themselves, to make this home a safe space, and I wanted them to understand how they hurt me. How unseen and unheard I felt. To think about how their words and actions impacted me, and were very harmful. I felt like I was putting in so much effort to get them to understand and it was like talking to a brick wall. 

I read out this whole letter to them during dinner. And I felt so proud of myself for standing up to them, for a split second. But then they started saying every textbook response you could think of (I'm not racist, I don't see color, blah blah blah). My stepdad was slamming dishes around in the sink. 

Basically, it felt like the rug was pulled out from under me. I felt like they had stabbed me in the back, betrayed me. And I thought I could always count on them to have my back. I thought they would be my safe space since thats what parents are supposed to do. And since my dad was alreadu shitty, I thought I would have at least one parent to be there for me. 

So to find out that in the end, they would act in emotionally abusive ways towards me was unbearable. I did move out but it took a year. Oh and I forgot that my mom said I had to apologize for ""my blowup"" which I did. But it was the emptiest apology I'd ever given. It broke my heart, really. 

During that whole year, I had seen a couple of therapists and they all were like, yeah you've experienced racial trauma. And I was not doing well mentally. I already have CPTSD and this just compounded on top was very difficult. 

When I moved out, they helped with moving furniture and stuff. They helped me paint and put in lights and generally, just get everything set up. It was a fun project, being able to spend time with my mom. Because we were really close. I have realized that our relationship was unhealthy, and she treated me almost like her therapist rather than her child. But also infantalized me at the same time. So since she was coming over all the time, I realized how uncomfortable I was with being in relationship with her. Because during the time, they had acted like everything was fine. Oh, no problems at all. But they weren't addressing the issue. 

So I told them I needed some space and she freaked out. Saying, oh it's convenient timing since we had just finished painting and putting in lights. But I don't even think I had asked her to do that. She had offered to help. And I also thought they would have been offended if I had hired someone to do it, like why waste your money when we can? And I did appreciate all they did for me.

But then she sent me a goddamned spreadsheet for reimbursement for all the work. And for gifts. Like she bought me a knife set as a housewarming present and then said I owed her money for it. I was upset, but I did pay her because I felt so guilty. Shouldn't have done it because she sent another one a couple months later.

This was for the kitchen table and guest bed and she said I had to give her the coffee table back. This was particularly upsetting because that was also a gift. My great-grandpa was a woodworker and he made it for her, which she gave to me. It meant a lot that she gave it to me because he died when I was 10. I put my foot down and said I wasn't paying. 

I started getting really scared they were going to come over and take all my stuff. Because where would they draw the line? Books, clothes, what have you? No. I did go over to drop off the table because I did not trust them on my property. And I was like, bye. Like, leave me alone.

But then, my grandpa (mom's dad) was in the hospital. Now, I did not know him well. We had basically no relationship at all. He just gave us money for Christmas and birthdays. Maybe showed up at special events. But I had asked my mom not to contact me unless it was an emergency. And so she sent this passive aggressive text, ""Was this not emergency worthy?"" And I said, I'm sorry he's not well, hope he's ok. But I also said, ""I don't know what else you want me to do?"" And went on this whole rant about how I was selfish and how she was there for me when my grandma (dad's mom) died last year. Which, no she was not. She didn't come to the funeral and was asking me if she should, or should send flowers. And didn't come to support me. 

And she said in this text how I wouldn't even support the family that had always been there for me even if I wouldn't do the same for them.

But I honestly don't know what she wanted me to do? He lived in Chicago, and it's not like I would fly out to see him. I didn't know him. I'm not a grief counselor or anything, and I don't know why she would expect me to do anything. It was just guilt tripping. I basically said, nope. F off. Why would I support her given the way she has treated me? I mean, I'm sorry that he wasn't well, genuinely. But it's not my job to care for her like that, you know? She has my stepdad. It's almost like she just wanted me present physically just to keep up appearances that we're all happy. It's hard not to feel like I am selfish though. I just can't provide that sort of care that she's expecting, especially not as her child. 

I haven't heard from her since November. My grandpa did pass away in February but I didn't go to the funeral. I made that mistake with going to my grandma's funeral and I felt like shit after. 

Basically, things have been getting better since this whole mess. But it's like a roller coaster. And it's hard not to internalize the guilt and shame, but this honestly was not my fault. I was not the one saying racist things, or sending spreadsheets. And she keeps going on about how I played a role in this, and it's like, what? There's nothing that would justify this behavior from anyone. All I did was stand up for myself and my friend and they didn't like it. And all I've done since then is protect myself from their bigotry because I don't have to take it anymore. And if they have a problem with that, it is truly their own issue.

1l1l1qz,https://www.reddit.com/r/caraccidents/comments/1l1l1qz/i_was_in_a_nearfatal_uber_eats_crash_my_lawyer/,üí• I was in a near-fatal Uber Eats crash. My lawyer told me to settle for $15k. I fired him‚Äîand got over $90k.,"On Aug 05 of 2023, I drove cross-country from New Jersey to California alone, delivering for Uber Eats to support myself. I was in Burbank, CA, and had just picked up food from Habit Burger & Grill. I turned left on a green arrow when a speeding driver ran a red light and slammed into the passenger side of my 2022 Honda Civic.

Glass exploded everywhere. The glove compartment was crushed shut. For a moment, it felt like time stopped. I sat there, frozen. A couple ran over to check on me. The other driver just sat still. Later, I found out he thought someone had been in the passenger seat.

The cops showed up. I told them everything. Oddly, they warned me not to talk to the group of people standing across the street‚Äîthey said they were ‚Äújust looking for money.‚Äù But one of them ended up being a witness who caught the whole thing on dashcam.

My car was totaled, and that night I ended up at a junkyard with my things in a shopping cart. Across the street was an IKEA I had visited earlier that same day. I‚Äôd been sitting in the parking lot in the sunshine reading their ‚Äúhej‚Äù sign, thinking about life and my family‚Äîunaware that fate would lead me right back there in a completely different state.

I had no money and nowhere to stay. I sat on the steps of a nearby church, trying to understand what just happened. Later, someone offered me a ride to a cabin they said was nearby. I accepted.

That ride quickly turned into a horror story. The man got weird. Touchy. At one point, he clutched my neck with one hand while driving. He said insane things like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to suck your cock,‚Äù when I‚Äôd said nothing remotely sexual. Eventually he pulled over on a deserted road and said, ‚ÄúThis is it. We‚Äôre here.‚Äù

I had the instinct to stay calm. I mentioned a nearby bar he‚Äôd spoken about earlier. That suggestion got him moving again. Miraculously, he drove me back to where he picked me up. I survived two nightmares in one day.

The next day, I was walking through California with my shopping cart, blisters on my hands. I bought a coffee with the last of my money. At CVS, while I was on the phone with Uber trying to get a rental, a woman hugged me and said, ‚ÄúGod loves you.‚Äù I‚Äôll never forget her.

I called my parents. They helped get me a motel for the rest of the trip and paid for my flight home.

Now the legal side:
I hired a top firm called Arash Law that supposedly specialized in Uber accidents. They didn‚Äôt even propose a settlement until nearly two years later‚Äîand it was $15,000‚Äì$25,000. I fired them immediately.

Uber didn‚Äôt pay a cent. They had no UIM coverage. GEICO was my last resort. My mom (a former NY attorney) had an intuition to call GEICO herself. We got to a GEICO agent who told us that although rideshare coverage is excluded, my Uber Eats delivery wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúrideshare‚Äù by legal definition.

GEICO first offered $50k. I negotiated it to $65k. Then I received the $15k policy limit from the at-fault driver‚Äôs insurance (Progressive), and later an additional $9,900+ from GEICO for medical.

That brought my total to over $90,000.

Arash, during a tense call with my parents and me, once said, ‚ÄúYou could walk into GEICO‚Äôs office with a loaded gun and it wouldn‚Äôt make them pay.‚Äù Well‚Ä¶ we proved him wrong.

It was just me and my mother‚Äîarguing sometimes, struggling together‚Äîbut ultimately doing what no law firm could do for me. She gathered all the documents from my chiropractor, neurologist, and therapist, and we pulled everything together at just the right time.

She told me one day, before the final payout:

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter what anyone else wants. It only matters what God wants.‚Äù
And I remembered that woman at CVS who‚Äôd told me the same thing.

That‚Äôs how I got justice.
And I‚Äôm telling this story so that you know you don‚Äôt have to settle‚Äîand sometimes the only people you need to fight for you are the ones who love you most.",1,1748878252.0,caraccidents,0,0.6,False

I guess I'm writing this to whoever might be having one of 'those' days. Remember, even the tiniest victories count, and maybe, just maybe, they give us the push we need.

1l1kwem,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1l1kwem/weird_result_from_first_natural_ethiopian_v60/,Weird result from first natural Ethiopian V60,"My first brew of a natural Ethiopian went...weirdly. And I am unsure about which variables to modify next time.

Here's what I did:  
  
[Bicycle Coffee (Oakland) light roast](https://www.bicyclecoffeeco.com/collections/all-items-1/products/12-oz-light-roast-coffee), Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Dumenso, natural process, roast date May 16

V60

21 clicks on Timemore C2s (on slightly coarser side of pour over range)

15g:250g

197 F water

Cafec T-90 medium dark roast filters

Modified version of Lance Hedrick 1-2-1 method:

Add ground coffee and make a divot

45g bloom, 1 minute, 1 gentle swirl after pouring

Pour the remaining water in 1 long pour, first half in circles with laminar flow for agitation, second half very gentle. Let it draw down, no further agitation.

  
The draw down was extremeley quick - the water barely stayed above the level of the coffee bed the entire time. Usually when I finish the long pour, the water is \~2/3 of the way to the top of the V60 (size 2) and I give the V60 a quick shake to level the coffee bed. This time there was so little water that the edges of the coffee bed were exposed within 5-10 seconds of finishing the pour so I had no opportunity to try to level the bed. And after drawdown, I saw that the coffee bed was shaped like an empty bowl, with a thick layer of grounds pushed up against all sides of the filter. I have never experienced something like this before - I usually end up with a level coffee bed.

The resulting brew was moderately (though not overwhelmingly) bitter and astringent with little to no acidity or brightness. I could taste quite a bit of complexity and the suggestion of fruit behind the bitterness but it was muted.

So, I'm confused about which way to tweak. The super fast drawdown suggests I need to grind a bit finer, but the bitterness suggests the opposite. But maybe the grind was ok and the fast drawdown was because there was such a thin layer of grounds at the bottom of the filter with lots of grounds pushed up against the sides. In which case I'd need to find a way to keep the bed more level (pause mid pour to shake/swirl?). And the bitterness and lack of acidity suggests I should lower the temp (maybe to 195?) and/or lower my ratio a bit (maybe 145g water instead of 150).

I was also dismayed to discover when I opened the bag that it was not sealed in any way, just folded and crimped down. So I guess it has technically been not entirely sealed over the 2.5 weeks I've been resting it.

1l1kw1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1l1kw1z/i_hate_my_life_so_much_since_becoming_a_mother/,I hate my life so much since becoming a mother,"I have a 5 year old autistic non-verbal daughter, and a 3 year old son. Both are done with school since last week. Since I'm a freelance Digital Marketing Manager I mostly work from home, and Mondays were actually a thing I'd look forward to. For a couple of hours I would¬†*finally*¬†get a quiet and tiddy home, and I could work and/or run errands in peace from 7:30am til they came home at 3PM.

Their dad (who I been married to for 11 years) and I separated about a month ago, so since he doesn't live at the house anymore the mayority of the time its just me stuck at home with both kids since I can't really do much with my oldest being autistic. He works as a manager in a men's department store, so the days he would come home at around 6PM, we would tend to the kids together and divide and conquer bedtime. Now it's mostly me the days he doesn't come over and/or takes the kids.

This past weekend I had the kids, so I'm exhausted, overstimulated and overwhelmed af. And since school is over, instead of a relaxing Monday morning were I can drink my coffee in peace and work in silence, I have two kids ALL DAY at home making noises, fighting, asking me for shit, and making messes while I'm¬†*trying to work.*¬†My youngest doesn't start summer camp until Wednesday, and my oldest is staying home with me all summer since the government defunded Special Education programs where I'm from. I also can't afford a nanny or a helper in my current financial state.

I truly hate my life, I hate that I'm the only one that has to bend to everyone's schedule so I can have alone time, leave the house, or do anything really. Before they started school, I was a work-from-home-mom and I'd be home with BOTH kids *EVERY DAY ALL DAY* just waiting for the moment their dad finally came home from work so I could be left alone and lock myself in my room.

STBX works every day except Wednesdays, and a couple of Sundays a month. The rest of the week AND weekends he works either from 8am to 5pm, or from noon to 9pm. If he worked on a Sunday, he's out from 10am to 7pm. His job is one of the many reason I asked for a divorce. I'm also the default parent, main provider (Yes, I also make more money), and of course, the one the runs the mental load, schedules, appointments, etc. My mom is the only family member that helps out with them, but she still works also. But at least she cares for them or takes them for the weekend whenever she can.

For the past almost 6 years, I've been super depressed while constantly sacrificing my physical and mental health. I get constant migraines, I'm almost always in a irritable mood, I'm so anxious I barely eat. Most days I feel sick or very fatigued that I can barely function, I'm always behind in work because I'm juggling 20 things at the same time with my kids and don't have a team to delegate things to, my cortisol levels are always high, my needs always come last, I barely leave this effing house and most days I just don't want to go on.

I have obsessive thoughts like ""Why the \*\*\*\* did I have kids?"" or ""Why did I want a family?"" since everything in my life sucks so much since then. I truly¬†*hate*¬†motherhood in every way, I hate that my STBX just gets to do whatever without having to find childcare or help, while I have to keep mothering, thinking about everything and everyone's needs while also keep running the show¬†*no matter what*.

I've been up since 6:30am with both kids. I wrote this rant at 9:35AM while locked up in my bathroom sobbing from the sadness and desperation I feel. The day already feels like a lifetime, and summer is just barely beggining.

And yes, I go to therapy once a week. It helps, but doesn't change how things function for me at home. I don't know how I'm going to survive this summer, or continue on with this life. I just have to hope better times are coming...",27,1748877880.0,regretfulparents,3,1.0,False

1l1kusj,https://www.reddit.com/r/prediabetes/comments/1l1kusj/prediabetes_before_pregnancy/,Prediabetes before pregnancy,"Background: 30F 123lbs, 5'5"", with PCOS

So, I was told I was in the prediabetes range at 5.8 mid March, since then I've been taking this inositol supplement and at the time I only slightly adjusted my diet. However, about a month ago I got my cholesterol results and those were pretty high and I figured I should take my diet more seriously. I have cut out processed sugars and most carbs (from time to time I still have beans, lentils quinoa, what bread, ect), eat less red meat and cut out most dairy (for my cholesterol) with the exception of 1 meal a week. 

Breakfast is usually: egg whites some veggie, and avocado and sometimes turkey sausage or overnight oats with blueberries 

Lunch is usually:tuna salad with light mayo, chicken salad, grilled chicken, with veggies ect.

Dinner is usually: some type of chicken/salmon with veggies and on occasion complex carbs

Late night snack: Greek yogurt with chia seeds and blueberries (I read Greek yogurt was fine for cholesterol)

Sunday morning: this is usually where I break and have a kolache and iced coffee because what's life without a little pleasure?

Anyway, now I'm pregnant (only a few weeks) and I'm curious if the pre-diabetes means I'm going to have gestational diabetes?  Has anyone had any experience with this? Should I stop with my Sunday morning happy meal? Am I overthinking it?

Forgot to add, I won't get tested again until August by my regular doctor but I'm not sure how accurate it'll be since I'll be pregnant? And I don't remember how far along I have to be for the one pregnant women have to take.",1,1748877796.0,prediabetes,3,1.0,False

The reason we split is because as soon as the baby came, and I had a 32 hour labour that resulted in an emergency caesarean, he never helped. He gamed, slept and allowed his family to push boundaries (ie let his mother who had cold sores, kiss our newborns face just as one of the many examples).

Last night I had a really hard time putting our 1 year old to sleep, maybe a sleep regression, teething, who knows. I do all of the parenting and my son is BF just as much as a 6 month old. (I‚Äôve been weaning but it‚Äôs just not happening as fast as I want it to). 

I, through tears of exhaustion (baby slept 3 hours that night, I didn‚Äôt sleep, dad slept the best for a whopping 10 hours as usual) told him that it‚Äôs just so hard to get up and chase him around all day on no energy and fight his tantrums of wanting to be BF constantly or wanting my coffee (to the point were I‚Äôm hiding in the toilet, sculling it and feeling sick because of it) then the confusing meltdowns I‚Äôm not sure he even understands (Ie shoving a box of wood blocks at me, I empty the box, he cries. I fill it back up, he cries. I put the lid on, he cries. I put it away, he throws himself on the floor.)

He offered to put him to bed for the first settle (he has about 5 per night) and I told him to not fall asleep on my bed because he‚Äôs a heavy sleeper and snores loudly and will hurt the process rather than help. He told me not to worry about it and just to have a shower or something and treat myself to some me time. I sat on the couch watching the baby monitor for 30 minutes and heard the baby cry for the whole time. I snuck in and settled him in his cot and pulled up the railing, seeing my ex passed out on my bed, I gave him a gentle shake and he woke up and loudly said ‚Äúthat was rude, I was having a nice dream‚Äù, waking the baby up instantly. I frustratingly told him to get tf off my bed and get tf out of my room.

Around the time we broke up we were already sleeping in separate rooms due to his loud snoring, inability to wake up to alarms or even the baby crying next to him. He wanted to do the ‚Äúcry it out‚Äù method when it comes to sleep and settling but I always did the method of sitting next to the cot and patting the mattresses. When watching the baby he would pass out including a time where I went to have a shower and I came in to the scare of my life where he was still, face down in a thick blanket/duvet with his dad passed out on the couch whilst baby was 2-3 months old doing tummy time.

His family laughs it off as a joke because for them to get him up for school they‚Äôd use to tell him he only had 5 minutes before school started and he‚Äôd panic to get ready. I mean this guy can‚Äôt even wake up to an alarm next to his head, baby wailing or our dogs barking. He‚Äôs fallen asleep mid conversations before, during games, on the toilet, during dinner. He gets so much sleep! When I go to bed he‚Äôs sleeping and when I wake up he‚Äôs still asleep. A lot of the time he goes to bed before the baby and when baby wakes up for the day, he‚Äôs still passed out!!

So‚Ä¶ Would I be the AH if I told him he needs to get  professional help around his sleep problem?",2,1748877738.0,WouldIBeTheAhole,2,1.0,False

[**James Keul ""A Painter's Life""**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/opening-reception-james-keul-a-painters-life-2/)¬†at¬†**Craven Allen Gallery**  


* James Keul‚Äôs new show, A Painter‚Äôs Life, examines our connection to nature. Keul is an accomplished artist who has taught painting around the world, working in a variety of mediums to develop the deft, painterly technique seen in his work.
* The exhibition includes a selection of plein air works from his native North Carolina and abroad, as well as large-scale paintings which explore the impact humans are having on the natural world. In these paintings, Keul includes figures, both adults and children, to invite us to consider how our actions will impact future generations.
* Keul values art not only for its own sake, but also as a meditative practice which has guided his life. ‚ÄúHaving had an unconventional adolescence, flying back and forth between parents and coasts, and being sent, at age 16, to a therapeutic boarding school in Western Samoa, art has been true north on my life‚Äôs compass, helping to guide me through some turbulent events and teaching me the value of patience, perseverance, and humility‚Äù he says.
* Keul‚Äôs work can be found in important public and private collections around the world. As an educator committed to empowering the next generation of artists, he will be teaching a group of Savannah College of Art and Design students at their campus in Lacoste, France this summer.

* ‚ÄúCannupa Hanska Luger: Speechless‚Äù explores and amplifies the problematic colonial history and the concept of cargo cults from an Indigenous perspective. Cargo cults developed as a result of Western military campaigns that sent crated, often airdropped, supplies to foreign lands inhabited by Indigenous peoples. This exhibition features several momentual works by the artist, including a large-scale radio made from pine trees titled ‚ÄúThe Keep‚Äù, three of the artists' ‚ÄúTransportable Intergenerational Protective infrastructure (TIPI)‚Äù works, an immersive video, a series of speaker towers, and a group of Native Americans bustles, a traditional part of Native American Powwow regalia.

1l1kljr,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1l1kljr/patient_zero_ward_b/,Patient Zero: Ward B,"The fluorescent lights in the ER hummed their familiar tune, that low electrical buzz Dr. Aris Vega had learned to tune out after twelve years of emergency medicine. She knocked back the dregs of her fourth coffee‚Äîburnt and bitter, just how the night shift liked to brew it‚Äîand checked the wall clock. 2:47 AM. Another nine hours until she could crawl into bed and forget about the parade of drunks, overdoses, and minor traumas that made up a typical Tuesday night at Metropolitan General.

Her feet ached in her worn sneakers. She'd already logged eight miles according to her phone, just pacing between trauma bays. The ER was surprisingly quiet for a Tuesday. Just two patients in the waiting room‚Äîa construction worker with a nail through his hand and a college kid who'd taken too much Adderall studying for finals. 

""Might actually get to eat tonight,"" she muttered, heading for the break room.

""Shh Don't jinx it!"" called Sonya from the nurses' station. Twenty-three years on the job and still superstitious about the Q-word. ""Last time someone said it was quiet, we had that twelve-car pile-up.""

Aris was reaching for her sad desk salad when the radio crackled to life. 

""Incoming!"" Marcus, the triage nurse, burst through the double doors. ""Three ambulances, ETA two minutes. Some kind of mass casualty event downtown. Details are sketchy as hell.""

The salad went back in the fridge. Aris tossed her paper cup and moved. ""What've we got?""

""Dispatch says multiple victims with severe lacerations and... I don't know, Doc. They're saying the patients are combative. Really combative. Cops are riding along.""

She'd seen her share of PCP freakouts and bath salt incidents. Last month, they'd had a guy convinced his skeleton was trying to escape his body. Took six orderlies to hold him down. The human body could do remarkable things when the right chemicals hijacked the brain. 

""Alert security. Get restraints ready for all beds. And Marcus? Tell everyone to double-glove.""

""Already on it."" He paused at the door. ""Doc? Dispatch sounded scared. I've never heard them sound scared before.""

The first ambulance screamed into the bay, and Aris met it at the doors. The paramedic who jumped out‚ÄîRodriguez, she'd worked with him for years‚Äîhad blood splattered across his uniform. Not unusual. But his face was pale beneath the harsh ambulance lights, and his hands shook as he grabbed the gurney.

""What happened?"" she asked as they wheeled it out.

""I don't fucking know."" Rodriguez's voice cracked. He rattled off vitals like a prayer. ""Found him in an alley off Third Street. Witnesses said he was attacked by some homeless guy who just... went crazy. Bit him, clawed him up good. We sedated him with ten of midazolam but he's still‚Äî""

The patient on the gurney convulsed, straining against the restraints with enough force to make the metal frame groan. Male, mid-thirties, what was left of an expensive dress shirt torn to ribbons. Deep puncture wounds on his neck and forearms, tissue damage consistent with human bites. The wounds were strange though‚Äîtoo deep, like the attacker had an unusually powerful jaw. But it was the sounds coming from his throat that made Aris pause. 

Not screaming exactly. Something lower, more guttural. Like an animal trying to form words with the wrong anatomy. Her med school professor would have called it glossolalia‚Äîspeaking in tongues. But this was more primal. Pre-linguistic.

""Trauma One,"" she ordered. ""Get me two units of O-neg, full trauma panel, and someone from psych. Probably rabies protocol too‚Äî""

The patient's eyes snapped open. The pupils were blown so wide the irises were barely visible, just thin rings of brown around bottomless black. He stared at her with an intensity that made her skin crawl, tracking her with jerky movement. Then his jaw began to open.

And open.

And open.

The mandible distended past the point where ligaments should have torn, where the temporomandibular joint should have dislocated. His mouth became a cavern lined with too many teeth. He let out a sound that rattled the windows and made everyone in earshot wince. It was almost a frequency more than a sound, something that bypassed the ears and went straight to the bones.

""Jesus Christ,"" Rodriguez muttered, stumbling back.

Two more ambulances pulled up, disgorging similar scenes. A woman in a business suit thrashing so violently she'd dislocated her shoulder, the bone pushing up beneath the skin in a way that should have had her screaming in agony. Instead, she made those same inhuman noises through a jaw that kept unhinging further with each attempt. A teenager with half his face torn off, the wound fresh and ragged, reaching toward them with fingers that bent backward at the middle joint.

Each patient exhibited extreme aggression, profound autonomic dysfunction, and vocalizations that sounded like someone had installed the wrong voice box. Their movements were wrong too‚Äîtoo fast in some ways, too jerky in others, like their nervous systems were being rewired in real-time.

""What the fuck is this?"" Sonya whispered, backing away from the teenager as he tried to bite through the restraints. His teeth left deep grooves in the reinforced leather.

""I need all hands,"" Aris called out. ""Everyone in trauma gear. And somebody get me the infectious disease protocol binder. Now!""

In Trauma One, Aris tried to examine the first patient while two orderlies and a security guard held him down. His temperature was 105.2¬∞F and climbing. Heart rate 180 and irregular. Blood pressure 200/140. Classic signs of a severe systemic infection or massive sympathetic nervous system activation. But she'd never seen numbers like this in a patient who was still conscious, still fighting.

His skin was hot to the touch, almost scalding. Subcutaneous hemorrhaging created spiderweb patterns across his chest. When she pressed a stethoscope to his ribs, the sound of his heartbeat was wrong‚Äîtoo many chambers firing, or firing out of sequence. 

""Get me ketamine,"" she ordered Janet, the night nurse. ""And where the hell is my blood work?""

""Lab's backed up. They've got similar cases from St. Mary's and Riverside. Whatever this is, it's not isolated.""

The patient's convulsions intensified. The leather restraints creaked, then started to tear. The sound was impossibly loud in the small room‚Äîleather shouldn't tear like paper. Then, with a wet tearing sound that would haunt her dreams, his jaw distended even further. The skin at the corners of his mouth split like overripe fruit, revealing red muscle and the white gleam of bone.

""Holy shit,"" breathed one of the orderlies‚ÄîKenny, just twenty-two, fresh out of school.

That's when the screaming started. Not from their patient‚Äîfrom everywhere. The other trauma bays. The hallway. The waiting room. A chorus of those impossible sounds, like a hundred voices trying to harmonize through shattered glass. The windows vibrated. A ceiling tile cracked and fell.

""What is this?"" Janet's voice cracked. ""Some kind of chemical attack? Biological weapon?""

Before Aris could answer, their patient broke free. The leather restraint on his right wrist didn't just break‚Äîit exploded into fragments. His arm shot out with inhuman speed, faster than Aris could track. He grabbed Kenny by the throat and pulled him close, that impossibly wide jaw gaping. 

The bite was savage, primitive. Not going for the jugular like an animal would, but for maximum damage. Teeth sank deep into Kenny's face, tearing through cheek and jaw, the sound of breaking bone audible over the kid's screams. Blood sprayed across the white walls in arterial spurts.

""Get back!"" Aris shoved Janet toward the door as security tried to pull the patient off. But he was too strong, moving with a feral energy that defied his injuries. His free hand came up, fingers somehow finding purchase in the guard's tactical vest, and he pulled the man down with enough force to crack the floor tiles.

Kenny's screams became gurgles, then stopped. But the patient kept feeding, making wet sounds that turned Aris's stomach. The security guard tried to reach for his weapon, but the patient's head snapped around‚Äîtoo fast, too far, like an owl's‚Äîand those teeth found his wrist.

Then the lights went out.

Emergency power kicked in a second later, bathing everything in a sickly red glow. In that brief darkness, Aris heard movement. Fast. Skittering. Like something learning to use a body for the first time. Joints popping. Bones grinding against each other.

When the emergency lights flickered on, the patient was standing. Kenny lay in pieces, throat torn open, eyes staring at nothing. The security guard was on his knees, clutching the stump where his hand used to be. The patient's head swiveled toward them with mechanical smoothness, and Aris got her first good look at what he'd become. 

The transformation was ongoing. She could see it happening‚Äîspine elongating, vertebrae pushing up through the skin like a ridge of mountains. His arms hung too long, new joints forming with wet pops. The jaw hung loose, connected by stretched tendons and torn muscle. Blood and saliva dripped from teeth that looked too long, too sharp, like the transformation had pushed them out of their sockets and kept going.

""Run,"" she whispered.

Janet didn't need to be told twice. They burst into the hallway to find chaos. Other patients‚Äîvictims, whatever they were‚Äîhad broken free. A nurse sprinted past, pursued by a woman whose arms bent at too many angles, moving in lurching, spider-like motions across the floor. Her fingers had somehow fused together into sharp points that left grooves in the linoleum.

A security guard fired his weapon‚Äîthe sound deafening in the enclosed space. The bullet caught one of the creatures center mass, punching through its chest. Black blood sprayed out, nothing like the red that should have been there. The thing didn't even slow down. But every transformed patient in sight oriented toward the guard like flowers following the sun.

They converged on him in seconds. He got off two more shots before they pulled him down.

""The sound,"" Marcus grabbed Aris's arm, appearing from behind an overturned gurney. His scrubs were torn, and there was someone else's blood in his hair. ""They're drawn to the fucking sound!""

He was right. The creatures‚Äîshe couldn't think of them as patients anymore‚Äîmoved with purpose toward any noise. A heart monitor's beeping drew three of them to crowd around it, heads tilted at unnatural angles, listening. When someone thought to silence it, they dispersed immediately, hunting for the next sound. One followed the drip of a leaking IV bag. Another pressed its face against a vending machine, drawn by the electrical hum.

""Storage closet,"" Aris whispered, barely breathing the words. ""Now.""

They slipped into a supply room, pressing themselves between shelves of gauze and saline bags. Through the door's small window, they watched the nightmare unfold. More staff fell, their screams cut short by those horrible, distended jaws. Some tried to fight back‚Äîshe saw Dr. Harrison swing a fire extinguisher at one creature's head, caving in its skull. It dropped, twitched, then got back up, head lolling at an impossible angle as it resumed its hunt.

And the infection‚ÄîGod, it spread so fast. The orderly from Trauma One was already convulsing on the floor, his body beginning its grotesque reconfiguration. She watched his fingers elongate, the bones cracking and reforming. His scrubs tore as his torso expanded, ribs pressing out against the skin.

""We need to warn someone,"" Marcus breathed against her ear. ""The CDC, the military‚Äî""

""With what?"" Janet held up her phone. ""No signal. Internet's down too.""

A sound cut them off. Not from outside‚Äîfrom right beside them. Aris turned to see a janitor huddled in the corner, pressed behind a shelf of bedpans. She recognized him‚ÄîHector, been here fifteen years, had three kids. His eyes were wide with terror, sweat beading on his dark skin.

But there was blood on his uniform. A small bite on his hand, barely breaking the skin.

""I'm okay,"" he whispered, voice shaking. ""It's just a scratch, I'm okay, I'm‚Äî""

His body seized. The convulsions started gentle, like a shiver, then violent. His jaw began to unhinge with a sound like cracking knuckles amplified. She could see his throat swelling, larynx pushing out against the skin as whatever structures created those sounds began to form.

Aris grabbed a scalpel from the shelf. ""Marcus, Janet‚Äîgo. Find another place to hide.""

""Doc‚Äî""

""Go! That's an order!""

They slipped out as Hector's transformation accelerated. Bones popped and shifted beneath his skin like creatures trying to escape. His eyes rolled back, showing only white, then something else‚Äîa nictitating membrane sliding across from the side. That awful sound began building in his throat, still recognizable as almost-human for another few seconds.

She'd taken an oath. First, do no harm. But what harm was there in ending this before he became one of them? Before he brought the others down on them?

She drove the scalpel into his throat, aiming for the larynx. The blade went in easy‚Äîtoo easy, like his tissues were already changing, becoming something else. Black blood spurted out, viscous and wrong, smelling of copper and ozone and something utterly alien. It burned where it touched her skin.

Hector gurgled, tried to shriek, but only managed a wet wheeze. His hands came up, grasping at the blade. His fingernails were already thickening into claws, and they left deep scratches in her forearms as she struggled to push deeper.

It wasn't enough. Even with his throat cut, he kept changing. Kept fighting. His spine curved into an S, and he dropped to all fours. She stumbled back, knocking over a cart of supplies. The crash was thunderous in the small space.

Through the window, she saw heads turn. They'd heard.

The janitor lunged, moving with that horrible spider-quick motion despite his injuries. She barely dodged, feeling the wind from his claws as they passed her face. His movements were clumsy, uncoordinated‚Äîthe transformation wasn't complete. She grabbed an IV pole and swung it like a club, connecting with his skull. The impact jarred her arms. Once. Twice. The third swing caved in the side of his head with a sound like stepping on rotten fruit.

He dropped, twitching. Still changing even in death. She watched his ribcage expand one more time, then go still.

The door burst open. Three of them rushed in‚Äîa nurse she'd worked with for years, now moving on all fours like some nightmare spider, her spine twisted so severely that her head faced backward; a patient in a hospital gown, ribs visibly shifting beneath the thin fabric, pressing out like piano keys; a cop, still wearing his vest and utility belt, jaw hanging by threads of meat, the weight of it pulling his head forward.

Aris pressed herself against the back wall. No escape. They advanced, drawn by her panicked breathing, her thundering heartbeat. The nurse-thing reached her first, inverted head tilting to study her with eyes that had gone completely black‚Äî

An explosion rocked the building. Not inside‚Äîoutside. Big enough to shake the walls and rain dust from the ceiling tiles. Car alarms went off in the parking garage, a cacophony of sound. The creatures paused, heads swiveling toward it in perfect unison. Then, as one, they rushed toward the noise, leaving Aris gasping against the wall.

She forced herself to move. Had to find Marcus and Janet. Had to find other survivors. The hallways were a slaughterhouse. Bodies everywhere, some still human, others mid-transformation. She stepped over a security guard whose spine had burst through his back like a grotesque mohawk, each vertebra sharp as a blade. Avoided a puddle of black blood that seemed to move with purpose, crawling across the floor, seeking living tissue.

The pediatric ward's doors were barricaded from inside. She could hear children crying‚Äînormal, human crying. Her heart clenched. But she kept moving. Drawing those things there would be a death sentence.

She found Marcus and Janet in radiology, along with six others‚Äîtwo radiologists, an anesthesiologist, a drug addict who'd been sleeping it off in the waiting room, and two patients' family members. They'd barricaded themselves in the MRI room, the heavy door and lack of windows providing some protection.

""Jesus, Doc,"" Marcus pulled her inside. ""We thought you were‚Äîyour arms.""

She looked down. Hector's scratches were deeper than she'd thought, blood soaking through her coat. But it was still red blood. Still human. ""I'm fine. What's our situation?""

""Fucked,"" said one of the radiologists‚ÄîPatel, she thought his name was. ""Whatever this is, it's not just here. I was on the phone with my brother at Cedar Sinai when it hit there too. Then the lines went dead.""

""The emergency broadcasts said something about a biological attack before they cut out,"" Janet added. ""Multiple cities. They were mobilizing the National Guard.""

Another explosion outside, closer. The building shook again. Through the observation window, Aris could see the ER's windows overlooking downtown. What she saw there stopped her cold.

The city was burning. Not in one place‚Äîeverywhere. The skyline was punctuated by fires, buildings collapsing, explosions blooming like hellish flowers. Military vehicles clogged the streets, soldiers firing at shapes that moved too fast to track. Tracers lit up the pre-dawn darkness like deadly fireworks. A helicopter spun out of control, its searchlight sweeping wildly before it crashed into an office building two blocks away. The fireball lit up the street, revealing hundreds‚Äîthousands‚Äîof those things swarming over abandoned cars.

And threading through it all, even through the thick hospital glass, she could hear them. A city's worth of impossible voices raised in a symphony of shrieks. The sound made her teeth ache.

""We can't stay here,"" she said. ""When they finish with the loud noises outside, they'll come back. Start hunting room by room.""

""Where do we go?"" Patel demanded. ""In case you haven't noticed, the whole fucking world is ending out there!""

""The basement,"" Aris said. ""There's an old fallout shelter from the Cold War. Concrete walls, one entrance. We barricade ourselves in, wait for‚Äî""

""Wait for what?"" The drug addict laughed, high and manic. ""The cavalry? They're all dead or turned. Face it, lady. We're fucked.""

A thud against the door cut off any response. Then another. Rhythmic. Testing.

They froze. Through the reinforced glass, Aris could see one of them. It had been a doctor‚Äîshe could see the remnants of a white coat stretched across its mutated frame. It pressed against the door, that grotesque head tilted, listening. Learning.

It tried the handle. When it didn't budge, the thing stepped back. Studied the keypad lock. Then, with movements that were clumsy but purposeful, it began pressing buttons. Random at first, then with more intent.

""They're learning,"" Janet whispered. ""Jesus Christ, they're learning.""

The keypad beeped‚Äîwrong code. The creature tilted its head at the sound, then tried again. And again. How long before it got lucky? Or before it simply decided to break through?

""The loading dock,"" Marcus said suddenly. ""There's a service tunnel that connects to the parking garage. We go underground, come up on Maple Street. It's away from the main fighting.""

""Through the basement?"" Aris asked.

""Yeah, but‚Äî""

A sound cut him off. Not from outside. From the MRI machine.

They all turned to look at the massive medical device, its bore dark and silent. Had been silent since the power went to emergency-only. But now something moved inside it. A shadow shifting in the darkness of the tube.

""Did anyone check‚Äî"" Patel began.

Mrs. Patterson emerged from the MRI bore.

Aris remembered her‚Äîseventy-three, possible stroke, had been waiting for imaging when everything went to hell. The kindly grandmother who'd been knitting in the waiting room was gone. In her place was something that used her body as a rough template. 

The transformation was more advanced than any Aris had seen. Mrs. Patterson's spine had extended, adding at least two feet to her height. She moved on all fours, but her torso had twisted so she could still face forward. Her hospital gown hung in tatters from a body that had added impossible muscle mass. Her jaw split into mandibles like an insect's, each lined with teeth.

She'd been in there the whole time. Silent. Waiting.

The old woman-thing shrieked.

The sound in the enclosed space was catastrophic. The observation window cracked. Everyone clutched their ears, blood running between fingers. The drug addict screamed and bolted for the door. Ran straight into the creature's embrace.

She took him completely apart. 

""Move!"" Aris shoved Janet toward the back exit. The others followed, stumbling over each other in their panic. Behind them, Mrs. Patterson's shriek had been answered. The door to the MRI room buckled as bodies slammed against it.

They ran through radiology, past the CT scanner where a technician's upper half protruded from the bore‚Äîhe'd tried to hide inside and gotten stuck when the transformation started. His legs kicked uselessly, bones breaking and reforming with each spasm.

The service tunnel was dark, lit only by emergency strips along the floor. Their footsteps echoed despite their efforts to stay quiet. Behind them, the sound of pursuit. Not running‚Äîskittering. Claws on concrete. Getting closer.

""Here!"" Marcus yanked open a maintenance door. They piled through into a mechanical room, pipes and boilers creating a maze of metal. He slammed the door, wedged a pipe through the handle.

Something hit the door hard enough to dent it. But it held. For now.

""That won't stop them for long,"" Patel gasped. ""We need‚Äî""

The anesthesiologist convulsed. They all saw the bite on her neck‚Äîwhen had that happened? During the escape? Before? She'd hidden it, kept quiet, and now‚Äî

""Get away from her!"" Aris ordered, but it was too late.

The transformation hit her like a seizure. She dropped, body contorting. Her scrubs split as her ribcage expanded, bones cracking like gunshots. Her fingers fused, split, fused again into something between hands and claws. When she screamed, it came out as that horrible shriek.

Patel grabbed a wrench and brought it down on her skull. Once. Twice. She kept moving, kept changing. The third blow finally stopped her, but black blood sprayed across his face, into his mouth. He gagged, spat, but Aris could see the fear in his eyes.

""I'm fine,"" he said quickly. ""I didn't swallow any, I'm‚Äî""

His pupils dilated. The convulsions started.

""Run,"" Aris told the others. ""Just run.""

They scattered through the mechanical room. Aris found herself with Janet and Marcus, the three family members having gone another direction. Through the maze of pipes, they could hear Patel's transformation‚Äîthe crack of bones, the wet sounds of tissue rearranging itself. Then his shriek, answered by others. They were surrounded.

""This way,"" Marcus led them deeper into the mechanical room. At the back, a narrow staircase descended into darkness. ""The old shelter's down here. Built in the fifties. Hospital used it for storage last I knew.""

They descended, feeling along walls thick with decades of paint. The air grew cooler, mustier. Behind them, the sound of pipes being torn apart. They were coming.

The shelter door was rusted but solid steel. Marcus fumbled with a ring of keys‚Äîhow did he have keys?‚Äîuntil one turned. They squeezed inside, pulling the door shut. Aris found an old bolt and slid it home.

The space was small‚Äîmaybe ten by twelve feet‚Äîwith concrete walls two feet thick. Metal shelves lined one wall, stacked with boxes of medical supplies from the eighties. A chemical toilet in the corner. A hand-crank radio. A single battery-powered lantern that cast weak, yellow light.

""Jesus,"" Janet slumped against the wall. ""Jesus Christ. What was that? What the fuck was that?""

""I don't know."" Aris examined her scratched arms. The bleeding had stopped, but the wounds burned. ""Some kind of pathogen. Rabies variant, maybe, but nothing I've ever seen. The speed of transmission, the physical changes...""

""Bioweapon,"" Marcus said quietly. ""Has to be. Someone engineered this.""

They sat in silence, listening. Even through two feet of concrete, they could hear it‚Äîthe death of their city. Explosions. Gunfire getting closer, then farther, then stopping altogether. And threading through it all, those impossible shrieks that human throats should not be able to make.

""My daughter,"" Janet whispered. ""She's at college in Boston. Do you think‚Äî""

""Don't,"" Aris said gently. ""We don't know anything beyond these walls.""

Janet cranked the emergency radio. Static filled the small space, then fragments of voices:

""‚Äîlost contact with units at Riverside and Memorial‚Äî""

""‚Äîdo not approach the infected, repeat, do not‚Äî""

""‚Äîextreme aggression and anatomical changes consistent with‚Äî""

""‚Äîdrawn to sound, repeat, they are drawn to sound‚Äî""

""‚Äîimplementing Contingency Seven‚Äî""

""‚ÄîNew York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston all reporting‚Äî""

""‚ÄîGod help us‚Äî""

Then nothing. The stations went dead one by one, leaving only static.

They tried to ration the battery on the lantern, sitting in darkness between checks. Time became elastic. Aris's phone had died, and her watch had broken during the fight with Hector. Could have been hours. Could have been days.

Sometimes they heard movement outside the door. Scratching. Testing. Once, something shrieked so close the concrete dust shook loose from the ceiling. But the door held.

""We're going to die down here,"" Janet said during one of the dark periods. Her voice was calm, matter-of-fact. ""If not from them, then from thirst. Starvation.""

""There's water,"" Marcus pointed to cases of sterile saline. ""And some energy bars in those boxes. Might last a couple weeks if we're careful.""

""Then what?""

No one answered.

During one light period, Aris found paper and began writing. If nothing else, someone should document this. The symptoms. The transmission. The behavior.

*Initial presentation: extreme aggression, hyperpyrexia, autonomic dysfunction. Transformation begins within minutes of exposure to bodily fluids. Major anatomical changes include:*

*- Mandibular dislocation and expansion*
*- Spinal elongation and restructuring*
*- Muscle tissue rapid growth*
*- Novel vocal structures (mechanism unknown)*
*- Enhanced strength and speed*
*- Apparent hive-mind behavior re: sound*

*Note: Infected retain some problem-solving ability. Tool use observed. Learning curve steep.*

*Pathogen origins unknown. Not consistent with any‚Äî*

A thud against the door. Then another. Rhythmic. Patient.

They froze. The lantern was off, saving battery, so they sat in absolute darkness. Aris felt Janet's hand find hers, squeezing tight. On her other side, Marcus's breathing quickened.

The handle turned. Back and forth. Back and forth. Testing. Then stopped.

Silence stretched between heartbeats. Aris couldn't even hear the city anymore, just her own pulse thundering in her ears.

Then it shrieked.

The sound was catastrophic in the small space. Even through two feet of concrete and a steel door, it was overwhelming. Aris felt her eardrums flex, threatening to burst. Something wet ran from her nose‚Äîblood. The shelves rattled, medical supplies cascading to the floor.

More answered the call. She could hear them gathering outside. Dozens. Maybe more. Drawn by their transformed colleague's sonic beacon.

The door shuddered. Old rust flaked from the hinges. It would hold‚Äîit was designed to withstand nuclear war‚Äîbut for how long? And even if it held, they were trapped. No food worth mentioning. Limited water. And outside, a city full of things that used to be human.

""We could make a run for it,"" Marcus whispered when the shrieking finally stopped. ""Next time they get distracted. Get to a car, get out of the city.""

""Did you see the streets?"" Janet's voice was hollow. ""Nothing's getting through that.""

They lapsed back into silence. Aris found herself thinking about her life, the choices that had led her here. Medical school. Residency. The decision to specialize in emergency medicine because she wanted to help people when they needed it most. She'd saved hundreds of lives over the years. 

None of it mattered now.

""I need to tell you something,"" Janet whispered. ""In case we... in case we don't make it. My daughter. Emily. She's not really at college. She's in rehab. Heroin. I've been too ashamed to tell anyone.""

""She's strong,"" Aris said. ""If she's fighting addiction, she's strong. She'll survive this.""

""You don't know that.""

""No. But hope is all we have.""

More time passed. The scratching outside became constant, methodical. They were testing every inch of the door, looking for weakness. The concrete around the hinges began to crack from repeated impacts.

Then Marcus stood up. Even in the dark, Aris could sense his movement.

""Marcus?""

""I'm sorry."" His voice was strange. Thick. ""I thought... I thought I had more time.""

The lantern clicked on, revealing Marcus's face. His pupils were dilated. Black veins spidere across his neck. A small bite on his hand that he'd hidden, kept wrapped.

""When?"" Janet scrambled away from him.

""The MRI room. When the old lady... I thought it was just a scratch."" He was already sweating, muscles twitching. ""I'm so sorry. I just... I wanted to help. Wanted to get you somewhere safe first.""

The transformation was starting. Aris could see his jaw beginning to unhinge, the muscles in his neck swelling.

""Kill me,"" he gasped. ""Please. Before I... before I call them. Before I let them in.""

Aris looked around desperately. No weapons. Nothing sharp enough, heavy enough. Marcus dropped to his knees, convulsions starting. His scrubs began to tear as his body expanded.

""The door,"" he managed to say through gritting teeth. ""Open the door. Run. While they're... focused on me.""

""Marcus, no‚Äî""

""DO IT!"" The words came out half-shriek. His vocal cords were changing.

Janet was already at the door, hands on the bolt. She looked at Aris, tears streaming down her face. Outside, the scratching had stopped. They were listening. Waiting.

""I'm sorry,"" Aris whispered to Marcus.

Janet threw the bolt and yanked the door open.

They were immediately there. Dozens of them, packed into the narrow corridor. What had been doctors, nurses, patients, visitors‚Äînow unified in their horrible transformation. They poured into the room like a wave of flesh and teeth and impossible angles.

Marcus shrieked‚Äîfully changed now‚Äîand they converged on him. The sound was deafening, a dozen voices joining his. In the chaos, Aris grabbed Janet and pulled her through the mass of bodies. Claws raked her back. Teeth snapped inches from her face. But they were focused on Marcus, on the newest member of their horrible congregation.

They ran. Up the stairs, through the mechanical room where Patel's remains painted the walls black. Through radiology where more bodies lay in various states of transformation. The hospital was quiet now‚Äîno more gunfire from outside, no more explosions. Just the whisper of wind through broken windows and the occasional distant shriek.

They made it to the loading dock. The bay doors were open, revealing a city that looked like hell had risen to the surface. Buildings burned unchecked. Military vehicles sat abandoned, some still running. Bodies everywhere‚Äîhuman and otherwise. The sky was the color of old blood, whether from fires or something else, Aris couldn't tell.

""There,"" Janet pointed to an ambulance, keys still in the ignition. They'd made it five steps when something dropped from above.

It had been a soldier once. Still wore the remnants of tactical gear stretched over its mutated frame. It landed between them and the ambulance, head tilting as it studied them. This one was different‚Äîolder, maybe. More evolved. Its movements were smoother, more purposeful. Almost intelligent.

It didn't shriek. It watched.

""Back away slowly,"" Aris whispered. But there was nowhere to go. More were emerging from the shadows, drawn by some signal she couldn't perceive. They moved with purpose, coordinating. Hunting.

Janet broke first. Turned to run. The soldier-thing moved faster than sight, covering the distance in a heartbeat. Its claws punched through her back, emerged from her chest. She looked down at them with surprise, blood bubbling from her lips.

""Run,"" she whispered to Aris. Then louder, screaming: ""RUN!""

Her dying shriek brought them all. Every creature in earshot converged on the sound. Aris ran, Janet's sacrifice buying her seconds. She made it to the ambulance, slammed the door as bodies hit the vehicle. Started it, threw it in gear.

She made it three blocks before the engine died. EMP, maybe, from whatever weapons the military had tried. Or maybe just bad luck. The creatures were already approaching, drawn by the engine noise.

Aris looked at the city around her. At the end of the world painted in blood and fire. At the things that used to be human closing in from all sides. She thought about Hector's kids. Janet's daughter in rehab. Marcus trying to save them even as the infection took him. All the people who'd woken up today thinking it was just another Tuesday.

The creatures were close now. She could smell them‚Äîrot and copper and something alien. Could hear their breathing, wet and labored. In her pocket, she found the pen she'd been using to document symptoms. Laughed at the absurdity of it.

Then she had a thought. A final act of defiance, or maybe just delay of the inevitable.

She bit down on her own tongue. Hard. Blood filled her mouth‚Äîred blood, still human. The pain was extraordinary, but she bit harder, severing it completely. Blood poured down her chin.

When they took her‚Äîand they would take her‚Äîshe wouldn't be able to shriek. Wouldn't be able to add her voice to their horrible chorus. It wasn't much, but it was something.

The first creature reached her as the sun began to rise over the dying city. Its claws were almost gentle as they pierced her skin. The infection hit her bloodstream like molten metal, rewriting her from the inside out.

Her last human thought was a prayer‚Äînot for herself, but for anyone who might survive this. Anyone who might find a way to fight back. Anyone who might reclaim the silence.

Then the transformation took her, and Dr. Aris Vega ceased to exist.

By noon, Metropolitan General stood empty except for the creatures that haunted its halls. In the basement, in a shelter built to withstand nuclear war, Marcus's remains lay scattered. On the floor beside them, barely visible beneath the blood, lay a water-stained notebook. The last words, written in a shaking hand:

*Tell anyone who reads this: sound is death. Silence is survival. The world ends not with a whimper, but with a scream.*

*God help us all.*",3,1748877183.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

the only credit i will give the writers is the storyline for Lisa and her film. that actually is interesting and has substance. (am i the only one who swears she was pregnant in the last episode of season 2, and now she‚Äôs drinking wine and coffee? maybe i missed something) 
i can also appreciate carrie running around her huge house, i think that was symbolic for the fact that she is clearly lost or a bit over her head and not as happy as she claims. 

other than that, complete trash. the cringey phone sex? i actually used to like aiden but wtf was that. idk if that was foreshadowing that aiden is just not shit and doesn‚Äôt care about her FR, or if that was these old ass writers‚Äô way of trying to insert the ‚Äúsex‚Äù in SATC. but there was nothing sexy about it. they did the same with the weird virgin mary storyline with miranda. wtf was that?? not funny, not cute, not interesting, and it was actually gross to look at. 

and charlotte and that damn dog storyline? who gives a damn?! i skipped through those scenes cause why am i watching you argue with a random lady about a dog?! i get that they need filler scenes but that was just weak. 

idek what was going on with seema. i guess she left that man or whatever. boring. the ONLY reason i watch is bc i really cared about these original characters. but man they‚Äôre making it so hard to stick with it. ",24,1748877098.0,Andjustlikethat,12,0.88,False

1l1khj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1l1khj1/aitah_for_not_speaking_up_when_a_guy_was_making/,AITAH for not speaking up when a guy was making me uncomfortable?,"(Just stating this before the actual post, but I tried posting this on r/relationship_advice but I got a warning at the bottom stating my post might be more suited for an AITA type of subreddit.)

So basically I (23F) met this person (27M) at a mixer/networking event at my school for TV/Film/Acting/etc. That was about a month or so ago. He eventually reached out to me to collaborate on a project with his friend. I was super stoked and excited to finally officially start voice acting and doing actual projects with people. We met up cuz he wanted to vet me, get to know me more to make sure I wasn‚Äôt gonna flake on him or anything like that. He mentioned that some people have flaked in the past and wanted to make sure I wasn‚Äôt gonna do that. Fair enough, I completely get that. 

It was chill. He seemed nice and friendly at first. I mentioned to him that I had social anxiety and trouble socializing so he knew that about me from pretty much the beginning. He seemed encouraging at the time so I thought that was good. At one point he mentioned his group of friends and the fact that a female was included in his group made me feel more at ease because in my head that meant that he was gonna be chill and would treat me platonically and professionally. Idk maybe my thought process was dumb about that lol. 

Anyways we chat for a while and it was chill and friendly. Nothing odd or strange. I‚Äôm generally a friendly and kind person and at some point we were chatting casually with a fellow person who goes to the same school. She referred to us as friends and we were like sure yeah lol I guess we‚Äôre friends haha y‚Äôknow like collaborating on something together and we hugged and chuckled. Idk maybe he took that a different way but in my eyes it was a platonic bro type of hug. Idk. 

Eventually, on a different day, we got together with some other people at the school to do a test recording for the project to see what type of character I might be able to voice. I guess he knew the professor/person who dealt with the recording booth at school and was able to schedule a time slot to record. It was chill. I had fun. Everything seemed pretty normal. He got me a cup of hot water from the Starbucks on campus cuz I had a bit of a sore throat and my voice was a bit crackly. I also double checked that the water wasn‚Äôt gonna cost money to get and he was like no yeah water is free. I appreciated him getting me the water. I would‚Äôve done the same thing for anybody else if they were in my position.

After the recording session was over we were walking to a different building cuz I had a class to go to and he had to return some equipment. He was explaining how he wanted to rewatch this one movie but none of his friends wanted to rewatch it with him and invited me to watch it with him because his friend works at the theater and I could get in for free. I have a hard time deciphering things socially sometimes and couldn‚Äôt tell if it was just a platonic friend type of thing or something else and I also have a hard time saying no to people so I said sure. 

He was messaging me online pretty much every day. Mostly normal conversations. I spoke to him like how I speak to all of my friends. He eventually asked over message of if I wanted to actually see the movie. I basically said ‚Äúokay, is it cool if I bring one of my close friends with me as well? He‚Äôs a creative type too and I think you‚Äôd get along‚Äù. I figured if I brought my friend with me and made it a group thing it would make it more apparent that I was only interested in being friends. And also I think if I‚Äôm gonna hang around a guy who I haven‚Äôt known for a while, it‚Äôs just generally safer for me as a female in this world lol. He was like ‚ÄúYa that‚Äôs cool!‚Äù And him saying that made me feel better in that specific moment because I was like okay he‚Äôs cool with that he must be a good person with good intentions. 

But yeah he messaged me every day and sometimes he said things that could be potentially read as maybe flirting or at least interest, but I didn‚Äôt wanna be rude and assume anything. Sometimes I‚Äôd call him bro or dude just to be safe. 

He was wanting to meet up again at school and I assumed it was most likely to discuss collaboration related stuff, but I still felt a bit paranoid. Eventually I invited him to this lunch thing me and some other classmates/friends were going to. I figured group settings are better and if we‚Äôre in a group he‚Äôll assume things are platonic and also I‚Äôm more comfortable in group settings anyway. Also he knows some of the people who went anyway so I figured it‚Äôd be chill. I was still anxious though because I overthink everything and it makes me anxious when I think there‚Äôs a possibility someone might be hitting on me, especially since I really struggle to set boundaries and say no to people. 

When he entered the establishment, I went in for a high five because I didn‚Äôt wanna risk anything, but he hugged me anyway. I felt a bit weird inside but pushed it aside. Later on, without warning, he hugged me again. This hug was definitely a more than friendly hug and I wanted to tell him he was hugging me way too long but the words were stuck in my throat. I didn‚Äôt know what to do so I was very awkwardly patting him on the back. He asked me ‚ÄúWhy are you patting me on the back? I‚Äôm not a dog.‚Äù I was like ‚ÄúOh sorry hahaha I‚Äôm just bad at hugging people.‚Äù My tone of voice was very obviously anxious and uncomfortable. I was basically in anxiety/dissociation mode and was still patting him on the back because he was still hugging me and was like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still patting me on the back. I‚Äôm not a dog‚Äù and I was like ‚ÄúOh haha sorry I‚Äôm bad at socializing.‚Äù My voice was still obviously very uncomfortable. 

Eventually he let go and I immediately beelined to sit in the corner of a booth next to another that was in the group. I was kinda anxious and dissociating and staring at the floor. He walks up to me and grabs my hand and was inspecting it basically saying how small it is. I very awkwardly said ‚Äúoh haha yeah I was probably malnourished as a child and stunted my growth.‚Äù He also put my hand up to his and compared the sizes. I didn‚Äôt know what to do so I limply just let it happen. 

He also brought up the movie he invited me to see. He told the group ‚ÄúYeah I invited her to see the movie with me but she was like nah fuck off lol.‚Äù I was like ‚ÄúNo haha I told you me and my friend could go see it with you.‚Äù

Eventually we all walked to a coffee shop near by cuz some people wanted some coffee and tea. I was just walking with the group quietly trying not to stand too close to him. He went up to me and was brushing my hair out of my face while I was quiet and uncomfortably staring at the floor in a daze. Then I awkwardly said hi to another friend that was in the group because I just wanted to interact with someone that wasn‚Äôt him. 

Eventually we all walked back to the parking lot. He came in a separate car from the rest of us (thank god). I was still kind of dissociating at this point. Before I could even get in the car with my friends, he, without warning, enveloped me in an uncomfortable way too intimate hug. It was obvious I was uncomfortable. I didn‚Äôt lean into it. I was actually leaning away. My arms were glued to my side and I was stiff and my shoulders were raised and I was looking away. He kept mentioning the movie and was like ‚Äúnah why don‚Äôt you wanna go with just me. Am I not swag enough?‚Äù and I was like ‚Äúno haha I just prefer group hangouts with my friends.‚Äù My voice was very obviously shaky and uncomfortable. Then, still trapping me in the hug by the way, was like ‚ÄúNahhh I‚Äôm not swag enough for you‚Äù and I was like ‚ÄúNo haha I just prefer group hangouts with my friends‚Äù voice still shaky and uncomfy.‚Äù I started dissociating more and I think he was talking about him or me being the one to make the plans. All I wanted was for him to let go of me but I was still frozen and dissociating. At that point I just kept responding ‚ÄúI dunno haha‚Äù ‚ÄúI dunno haha‚Äù. Also my ‚Äúhaha‚Äôs‚Äù that I do are very quiet, shaky, and clearly uncomfortable. Eventually after what felt like at least a minute or so he let go.

I just remember getting in the car and being like ‚Äúam I crazy or was he hugging me way too much‚Äù and they all agreed. I felt so anxious and overwhelmed and overstimulated that I just started to cry. They were comforting me and being so incredibly sweet to me and I really appreciated it. They were apologizing for not saying anything, they just didn‚Äôt know how well we knew Escher or how close we were so they weren‚Äôt sure if it would‚Äôve been overstepping a boundary to tell him to back off which I completely understand. They also told me if I was ever gonna be around him in the future to just text any of them and they‚Äôd come with me so I wouldn‚Äôt be alone. But yeah they were so nice and comforting and I appreciated that a lot. 

Eventually I ended up messaging him and told him the way he was hugging me for way too long and being way too touchy feely with me made me extremely and obviously uncomfortable and that everyone else could tell as well. I said that I was no longer interested in collaborating with him but I wished him luck. I was clear, firm, but polite. I didn‚Äôt wanna come off bitchy or anything cuz I‚Äôm afraid of him getting mad or bad mouthing me to other people or whatever or maybe I‚Äôm just paranoid lol.

But yeah I know he saw my message. He didn‚Äôt respond. He did unfollow me and unfriend me though so I hope he got the message loud and clear. I hope he doesn‚Äôt do this to another girl in the future. I‚Äôm glad what he did was at least in a group in front of people, good and kind people at that.

My partners aunt can be quite hurtful. In the past she has said some unkind comments which Ive let go of. For example, her insisting that women must listen to men when I tried to stop my brother in law from controlling his wife's coffee intake (she was wanting a cup at night and I spoke up for her). Before you all get shocked, this is a religious belief and while Ive heard it before, I simply believe the man shouldn't be unreasonable either. Anyways, she ""lectured"" me in her typical harsh tone in front of him. I left feeling badly like I shouldn't have spoke up. 

Another time she scoffed at me because I was refusing to call my mother in law ""mommy"" like my husband. She muttered quite aggressively ""kids these days, I love this generation."" There's been quite a few times that she mutters at me dissapprovingly. 

Most recently I mentioned going to a coffee shop (big mistake, I should have just said I was going out). She said Ive been there, I said yes you all went without me. She asked where I was to which I said at my home 15 mins awag, to which she replied ""You shouldve been here"". And ""we went early morning are you even awake then?"". Ir was quite hurtful and not a nice reply.

This must have stuck to me after many bad experiences because I asked my husband to speak with her. But when they talked, she overtook the conversation, said ""I took it wrong"" and that no one else would take it badly, and that she meant nothing, but that she could apologize for my husbands sake. My husband agreed she wouldnt ever ~intend~ to do wrong and didn't know how to tell me that, and that maybe in the future ~I~ could ask what she meant instead of just enduring her rude comments. She also said she's sure there's a lot of problems I have with the family, and she ""noticed"" I take things badly.. which makes me think she is judging me unduely, and I felt this notion should've been challenged.

This was obviously a big betrayal on his part and caused huge fights between us. He has finally understood how what he did wasn't ok and recognizes how he lost control of the conversation. I also give him a little slack because his aunt is manipulative. 

If you were dealing with this aunt in law what would you do? Do you find validity in my hurt feelings? I'm not even sure a conversation will be helpful with this lady.",1,1748876614.0,inlaws,0,1.0,False

1l1kai3,https://www.reddit.com/r/organicfoodonline/comments/1l1kai3/natural_health_wellness_101/,Natural Health & Wellness 101,"In a world filled with processed foods, chronic stress, and sedentary habits, the journey back to natural health and wellness is more vital than ever. By embracing whole foods, natural supplements, adaptogens, and balanced lifestyle practices, you can restore your body‚Äôs equilibrium and cultivate resilience. This guide explores the fundamentals of natural health and wellness, offering practical insights to help you live a vibrant, energized life‚Äînaturally.

## Foundational Nutrition: Whole Foods and Clean Eating

Nutrition is the cornerstone of natural wellness. Whole foods‚Äîthose that are minimally processed and free of artificial ingredients‚Äîare packed with essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants that support every bodily system.

Choosing organic whenever possible helps reduce your exposure to pesticides, hormones, and genetically modified organisms. Explore our curated [Organic Groceries](https://mycozyfarm.com/pages/organic-groceries-overview) collection to find pantry essentials that align with clean eating values. For deeper guidance, explore [How to Choose Healthier Foods Using Nutrition Data](https://mycozyfarm.com/blogs/news/how-to-choose-healthier-foods-using-nutrition-data-beyond-the-label).

### Tips for Nutrient-Rich Eating:

- Prioritize seasonal fruits and vegetables
- Incorporate whole grains such as quinoa, millet, and oats
- Choose lean, ethically raised protein sources
- Limit added sugars and artificial additives

Studies from [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/processed-foods/) suggest that diets rich in minimally processed foods are associated with reduced risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers.

## Adaptogens and Natural Supplements: Nature‚Äôs Wellness Boosters

Adaptogens are herbs and mushrooms that help the body resist stressors‚Äîwhether physical, chemical, or biological. These ancient botanicals can support adrenal health, regulate cortisol levels, improve stamina, and promote mental clarity.

Popular adaptogens include:

- **Ashwagandha** ‚Äì Supports stress reduction and vitality
- **Rhodiola Rosea** ‚Äì Enhances endurance and mental performance
- **Holy Basil** ‚Äì Balances mood and supports immune function
- **Reishi and Cordyceps mushrooms** ‚Äì Promote energy and immune modulation

Try [Organic India Ashwagandha](https://mycozyfarm.com/products/organic-india-wellness-supplements-ashwagandha-1-each-90-vcap) or [Four Sigmatic Adaptogen Coffee](https://mycozyfarm.com/products/four-sigmatic-coffee-adptgn-ashwgnda-1-each-10-ct) for daily support. Browse our full [Health Supplements Collection](https://mycozyfarm.com/collections/health-supplements) for more options tailored to stress, sleep, immunity, and energy.

### Scientific Backing:

Numerous clinical trials and pharmacological studies support the efficacy of adaptogens. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) highlights Ashwagandha‚Äôs role in reducing cortisol levels and improving stress resistance. Visit [NIH research on Ashwagandha](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6979308/) for details.

## Lifestyle Practices for Natural Health

True wellness is more than what you eat. Lifestyle habits such as movement, sleep, and stress reduction play a vital role in maintaining balance and preventing chronic disease.

### Sleep Hygiene

Sleep is foundational to recovery and immune function. Adults need 7‚Äì9 hours of quality sleep nightly. Minimize blue light exposure before bed, establish a calming routine, and consider natural aids like herbal teas. Cozy up with our [Chamomile Tea Collection](https://mycozyfarm.com/collections/chamomille-tea) to relax naturally. Learn more from the [CDC‚Äôs sleep guide](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/index.html).

### Mindfulness & Stress Management

Mindfulness meditation, deep breathing, and gratitude practices have been shown to reduce anxiety and improve cognitive flexibility. Harvard Health reports mindfulness may ease mental stress and anxiety‚Äîsee the full [Harvard study](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/mindfulness-meditation-may-ease-anxiety-mental-stress). For additional support, explore [Stress Relief the Natural Way](https://mycozyfarm.com/blogs/news/natural-stress-relief-guide-herbs-supplements-lifestyle).

### Movement and Exercise

Physical activity supports mood, metabolism, and mobility. Whether it‚Äôs yoga, walking, or weight training, consistent movement is crucial. Visit our [Sports & Fitness](https://mycozyfarm.com/collections/sports-and-fitness) collection for clean energy boosters, hydration support, and protein snacks.

## Embrace Your Holistic Wellness Journey

Your journey to natural wellness doesn‚Äôt require perfection‚Äîjust consistent, intentional choices. Begin by upgrading your pantry, experimenting with adaptogens, and adopting rituals that nourish your body and mind. Cozy Farm supports you with clean, organic products and education to help you thrive.

1l1k9g6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AASecular/comments/1l1k9g6/best_and_worst_aa_wisdom/,Best and Worst AA Wisdom,"My favorite AA sayings are those that helped me stay sober and gave me a way to think about my own sobriety and how I might help others.  There are other sayings in AA though that I very much disagree with and don't like. If you're a big fan of some of the ones I don't like, it's all good.  This is *my* list -- your list might look very different.  As the car commercials always used to say, ""your mileage may vary.""

So with that, here's my personal list of winners and losers.

## The Good

* ""Take it a day at a time, or five minutes at a time if you have to.""  I learned this from Phil at my first meeting.  I hope you meet someone like Phil.  He also told me to go to a meeting the next day.
* ""If you don't drink, you won't get drunk.""  This is sometimes called ""the AA guarantee."" It's a simple, self-evident promise that helps to organize our thinking around the main goal in early sobriety.
* ""Don't drink if your ass falls off.""  Recognizes that in early sobriety, it feels like that might actually happen.
* ""Bring the body, and the mind will follow."" Putting the drink down makes the hangovers go away pretty quickly, but more recovery takes time. Professionals in the field have coined the term ""Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome"" to encompass problems of irritability, distraction, sleeplessness, and anxiety that can persist through the first months and even as long as a year or two after the acute withdrawal phase.
* ""The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking.""  My sponsor, Bob, taught me this Third Tradition, along with the ideas that I should never judge anyone else's desire, nor should I let anyone judge mine.  (Including me, since I had an alcoholic doing the judging).
* ""You're in the right place,"" ""You'll be OK"", ""Keep coming"", ""The group is going out for coffee after.  Do you want to come?""  etc. Any sort of welcome to the newcomer is in the spirit of love that fills this fellowship on a good day.  Let's have more of that.

## The Bad

* ""Sit down shut up, and listen.""  Often said by people who don't like what you have to say, and haven't internalized Step 10 enough to realize that's not your problem, it's theirs.
* ""Share the message, not the mess.""  Setting aside the fact that this is more message policing, the fact that we can get through a mess sober *is* the message.  If hearing other people's problems upsets you, maybe you should stay home and watch TV.
* ""AA is spiritual, not religious.""  This is a marketing ploy, and a distinction without a difference.  It's tantamount to something like, ""Unlike other products that contain sugar, ours contains only natural, plant-based sugar.""  Well, gee -- in that case, give me three boxes, please!  That said, early in sobriety, I fell for it and stayed sober, so I guess it's not all bad.
* ""Your sponsor's job is to take you through the Big Book.""  Oh, look, it's Bible Study with a pal, with multicolored highlighters! Your sponsor is a guy who drank his way into AA, not a literacy volunteer.  If you want to read the book, read the book!
* ""Your sponsor's job is to take you through the steps.""  This is partly true, I suppose, but it misses perhaps 90% of the point. The steps are a design for living to be adopted into practical use, not a set of homework exercises to be ""gone through.""  This is the source of much nonsense, like new sponsors ""restarting"" you at step one.

There are probably lots more candidates that I've forgotten about for both columns.  What about you?  Any favorite winners and losers?

I was holding a couple of coffees, so I didn‚Äôt want to risk spilling them by reacting physically or getting into it with him. I looked over at an elderly man sitting next to me and gave him the classic *‚ÄúCan you believe this guy?‚Äù* look, but then I realized he was senile or something because he just stared blankly at me the entire ride without saying a word. 

The bus driver yelled at the guy to shut up a few times, and he eventually took a seat, but he kept yelling from there, ranting about how I was a dirty immigrant and so on.

I didn‚Äôt feel physically threatened, but in hindsight, I wonder if my silence just reinforced the idea that he could get away with it and that he‚Äôll do it again, maybe to someone more vulnerable.

Asians have a stereotype of being passive, and I don‚Äôt want to play into that. I know it‚Äôs important to stand up to this kind of hate, but I also wasn‚Äôt convinced that saying something would‚Äôve helped in that moment.

I was presenting quarterly reports and suddenly - frozen screen. Panic mode. I clicked on the WiFi icon on my laptop and saw all these networks. ""PrettyFlyForAWiFi"" - no lock symbol next to it. I clicked it, and it connected right away.

I figured anyone who names their WiFi that has to be pretty chill. The meeting went fine. I meant to call my provider that afternoon, but then I forgot. And their internet was actually faster than mine ever was - YouTube videos started instantly, no buffering wheel. My old connection always had that annoying delay.

Weeks went by. Then months. Every morning my laptop just connected automatically. I'd see that network name and smile - whoever this neighbor was, they had good taste in puns.

Last week I was checking my phone at the coffee shop when I noticed the WiFi list. PrettyFlyForAWiFi was gone. Instead: ""OhaiCoffeeCat99.""

I nearly dropped my latte.

CoffeeCat99. That's what I use on some games, chats and so on.

My stomach did this weird thing. How could they possibly know that was me? I don't understand any of this computer stuff, but can WiFi track who you are? Can they see my screen? Oh god, can they see which apartment the signal goes to?

The worst part is they're clearly still offering it. ""Ohai"" - like ""oh hi"" - specifically to CoffeeCat99. Which means they know it's me and they're... fine with it? But also means they've been able to see... what exactly?

I don't even know which neighbor it is. Could be anyone in the building - the signal's strong enough from multiple floors.

I called my internet company that same day. Turns out my service had never been cancelled, just some wire issue they ""forgot"" to fix. It's working again now, but every time I open my laptop I see ""OhaiCoffeeCat99"" in the network list.

Yesterday I left nice coffee beans outside every door on my floor with sticky notes: ""From a grateful neighbor :)""

If they figured out I'm CoffeeCat99, they'll probably figure out the coffee is from me. If not, at least everyone gets free coffee.

I still have no idea how they knew. Part of me wants to Google it, but honestly? They could have just turned on a password anytime in those six months. They didn't.

We have been trying to sell our house for about a year, so we put much of our stuff in storage when we went on the market. We recently discovered a couple of items had mold on them when we went there to look for something. We have since discovered about 70% of the items are ruined with mold. This is a climate controlled unit with ExtraSpace Storage. Their own website says to use climate controlled units for furniture to avoid mold and mildew. We did not get their insurance. Instead we relied on our homeowners policy. When I called State Farm, they said mold and mildew are not covered.He also said that nobody‚Äôs policy would cover mold. When I went to confront them, the manager admitted that the building had a leak but that they fixed it a a few days after it was discovered. Also, I knew they would say ‚ÄúWell, you didn‚Äôt get our insurance.‚Äù I told them all they had to do was to show me where their insurance would cover mold. She couldn‚Äôt show me then, but she said she would talk with her boss. After not hearing anything, I went back up there about 5 days later. Again all she said was you didn‚Äôt get our insurance. I said all you have to do is show me that your insurance would cover it and I will be on my way. She tried pulling up some policy, but just scrolled around pretending to look for something. I asked her to do a word search for ‚Äúmold‚Äù, and she said she couldn‚Äôt do that. lol. When we first thought it was limited to one recliner and a coffee table, we were just going to move on. However, now that we have seen the full amount of damage, we cannot just let it go. I just called State Farm because I‚Äôm pretty sure I want to have a denied claim before taking ExtraSpace to small claims court. State Farm is saying that even if they deny the claim, that I will have a claim on my record. I guess threatening increased rates in the future.

1l1k5sl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l1k5sl,Finishing touches for my living room,"**Submitted this a few days ago but it got caught in the spam filter, and by the time it got approved it was already buried and no one saw it. Trying again but removing the hyperlinks, I'll post them as a comment instead!**

Moved into a new flat last week which came unfurnished. It's been a lot more work than I expected and now that I've got it liveable I've taken a few days pause to just enjoy it and get on with my day-to-day life. Pretty happy with what I've achieved so far but seems a good time to get some feedback before trying to finish it off.

The sofa is brand new, everything else is replaceable. Budget isn't a huge issue, within reason, would happily spend another couple of grand on it. It's a rental so I'd be hesitant to start painting/wallpapering/drilling too much, although I do intend to stay here a few years at least.

Seems to be a rustic theme emerging that I'm happy to run with a bit, more wooden furniture, no hunting type stuff though (ie animal head statues or antlers). Also want to continue with little flashes of red.

The door with a little window in it leads to the kitchen, the other one into the hallway. Thinking about painting the trims dark brown. Maybe also a little print or something to cover up the window? Although at night it just looks like a black square, doesn't scare me like I thought it would.

Flat has a similar sized bedroom (where my desk is) but the kitchen is quite small, and the only other room is the bathroom, so this room has to double as the dining room, and any other room I may want.

Anyway, shopping list -

**Dining table and chairs**¬†\- probably oak to fit with the room, to go in the space behind the sofa. Possibly one that folds away partially/fully. And some sort of ornament to sit on it?

**Coffee table**¬†\- again oak/some other wood. Undecided on size, is this instead of the footstool or as well as? Possibly something like this as a signature piece - \[1\]¬†- can't decide if I love it or hate it

**Curtains**¬†\- the blind is crap, doesn't cover the window entirely, and doesn't block much light out during the day if I'm ever trying to watch TV then. Also there's already a curtain rail up, and need something to bring a bit of colour to that side of the room. Thinking good quality, thick, red curtains that go down to the floor.

And finally, perhaps most importantly,¬†**more stuff for the walls.**¬†On the big wall, I thought maybe something like this -¬†\[2\]¬†- not sure if you would line it up with the middle of the sofa or the middle of the entire wall. Above the TV, I think something naturey, with another red flash, picked out this -¬†\[3\]¬†- or this -¬†\[4\]¬†- (haven't looked at dimensions, and aware one of them is unavailable, it's more the concept at this point).

First time switcher here. I really have no idea how to deal with switching and multiple offers.

I recieved the publicis offer 1 month ago already and even recieved a joining kit(1 notebook,coffee mug and aam candy).  
So i am not even sure how to reject this offer.

Meanwhile i cracked the Genpact offer just yesterday in a walk in drive. They mentioned their budget was 8LPA earlier but seeing my current Salary (9.5LPA - Big 4), they are willing to go upto 14.  
So i guess its easier to reject Genpact as i havent signed the offer letter yet.

I have heard about Publicis' hire and fire policy and that if someone fails client interview, they will be laid off. But heard bad things about Genpact too.

I am well versed in Java, Microservices and DSA so i do believe i will be able to crack the interviews quite well.

Before I met him, I was engaged for 5 years. It was a horrible, toxic relationship. He was extremely insecure and controlling. I was allowed to talk to a few ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù friends, and had limited contact with my family since he hated them. He had to go with me everywhere, and if I went anywhere alone I had to be constantly communicating with him and had a time limit before he would throw a tantrum and make me come back. He didn‚Äôt drive either, so sometimes he would make me end my plans early so I could drive him somewhere. He didn‚Äôt cook or clean, and was just a mean person. We lived together and had our finances joined, so it felt impossible to leave. My best friend got married in October 2023, and I was a bridesmaid. Helping her with all of the wedding planning made me realize I was so unhappy with my relationship and that I did not want to marry him and be stuck forever. My current boyfriend was also a groomsmen, which is how we met. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about him. I looked him up on social media and stalked his pages lol. But since I was still engaged, I never talked
to him or crossed any lines. But I knew I couldn‚Äôt go on much longer. In February of 2024, I finally got the courage to ask for help from my family and I was able to leave my toxic relationship. It was the most freeing feeling ever. After I got myself settled, I reached out to my current boyfriend. We started talking every day, and went on a few dates. I was smitten from the first moment, and he was so incredible that it was so easy to fall in love with him. He picked me up for dates, tried to pay for everything, he never pushed any boundaries and waited for me to give him a green light before making any moves. Fast forward to now, I spend 6 nights a week at his house. He makes me coffee every morning before work, drives everywhere when we‚Äôre together, and is always asking me what I need/what he can do to help me. I‚Äôm closer with my family as they all love him and he makes an effort to show up and get to know them. My friends love him and love the fact that I am able to hangout more with no worries. He comes to all of my softball games and practices, even if it‚Äôs straight from work and he‚Äôs still dirty in his uniform (he‚Äôs a mechanic). I can talk to him about anything, which has always been a struggle for me since I have anxiety around confrontation or ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù conversations. He‚Äôs so perfect and I genuinely can‚Äôt believe this is real. I just know I‚Äôm going to marry him. Sometimes I feel bad talking about to my friends since most of them are single and struggling in that area, and I don‚Äôt want it to feel like I‚Äôm bragging. But I just needed to tell someone how perfect he is. ",3,1748875886.0,relationshipgoals,1,1.0,False

**Chapter 38. More than meets the eye**

  
Oswald Gooding lived in a place called the Werner Housing association. It looked like a wealthy neighborhood protected by tall perimeter walls and two guards at the wrought iron gates at the entrance. Hopper flashed them his Internal Police badge and they let us in.

We made our way up to Gooding's house. It was flanked by palm trees on either sides, had a lush green lawn at the front and a steam carriage in the driveway.

‚ÄúI can see why Canning‚Äôs detectives found Oswald suspicious,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThis place looks like it belongs to a merchant. Not a clerk.‚Äù

‚ÄúIndeed,‚Äù Hopper said.

I knocked at the door. The door cracked open in about two minutes. A man‚Äôs pale blue eye peered through the gap. ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI'm General Lloyd Hopper from Internal Police. We would like to ask you some questions, Mr. Oswald.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, alright.‚Äù Oswald slid the chain off and opened the door. We walked in.

The furniture in the living room looked just as expensive as the rest of the house. But as tasteful and pristine the decor was, there didn't seem to be any kind of personal touch to add flavor to the living space. No photo frames, no tapestries or any other addition that would've given the place more of an identity. It didn't look like the kind of place where someone lived. It was more of a movie set modeled after a pretty painting.

‚ÄúWhat brings you here, officer?‚Äù Oswald said. ‚ÄúIs this about Samantha?‚Äù

‚ÄúIndeed.‚Äù Hopper dug into his coat and pulled out a leather pouch that people sometimes used to store tobacco in.

‚ÄúI thought the internal police were done with questioning me,‚Äù Oswald said. His arms were on his sides and his entire demeanor was relaxed and confident.

‚ÄúJust a moment please,‚Äù Hopper said and shook some silver colored powder from the pouch and onto his palm. He looked at Oswald and blew the powder into his face.

The man coughed and waved away the remnant dust that was hovering around him. ‚ÄúWhat was that for?‚Äù

I frowned.

Hopper looked puzzled. ‚ÄúOh no,‚Äù he muttered and grabbed the porcelain vase that was on the coffee table and swung it towards Oswald's head.

The man tried to dodge but Hopper's movements were quicker and the vase smashed against Oswald's skull, making him stumble back. He gripped his head, wincing and whimpering before he crashed into the chair behind him, unconscious.

I watched the scene unfolding with bewilderment. ‚ÄúWhat was *that* for?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúThis is the dust of Ederanth seeds.‚Äù He waved the pouch full of silver powder.

‚ÄúIts purpose was to make Oswald more compliant and vulnerable to some minor hypnosis,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut it didn't seem to work.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, did you use that powder to control that blind man who gave us the address to Rosa‚Äôs public house?‚Äù I said.

Hopper nodded. ‚ÄúIndeed.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that powder always effective in doing that?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúIn some cases, it doesn't work as intended.‚Äù

I cocked my head. ‚ÄúWhich case may that be?‚Äù

Hopper gazed at the unconscious Oswald with a half-puzzled, half-intrigued look. ‚ÄúWhen I use it on a magic user.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt waste any time in pulling out my osteodial and focused on the question: *Is Oswald Gooding a dangerous man?*

The golden bone pointed at the symbol of ‚Äúno‚Äù. I frowned. It was supposed to be a simple question to create a stronger link with the world beyond the veil. Yet this was the answer it gave us.

Next I focused on the question: *‚ÄúIs Oswald Gooding a magic user?‚Äù*

The answer was no once again. I was frowning once again. ‚ÄúDid we do the right thing by taking Sydny Canning's word of Oswald being suspicious?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDidn't you say that this man was only connected to the case because of an instinct?‚Äù

‚ÄúBut if ederanth didn't affect him then that means he is a magic user.‚Äù Hopper said. ‚ÄúAnd if he is also the murderer, wouldn't it be easier for him to cover his tracks with whatever kind of magic he uses?‚Äù

Hopper slid the pouch of ederanth in his coat pocket and straightened his lapels. ‚ÄúMaybe we should just ransack this place while the man is still unconscious,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúYou can do that. In the meantime I'll try something else,‚Äù I said and pulled the curse channeling cards from my reticule.

At first Hopper was worried that I was going to kill the man. I reassured him that it wasn't going to be as bloody as Wyndham's apothecary.

He snapped a pair of handcuffs on Oswald‚Äôs wrists and bound the man to a dining chair with a rope. Then the witch hunter looked at me with an uncertain face. ‚ÄúWe are still operating against the law,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúComing after a man who is more or less deemed innocent. I hope your test of strength doesn't involve killing.‚Äù

Only if he deserves it. ‚ÄúNo, it doesn't.‚Äù

Hopper gave a nod and dug into his coat to pull out a cigarette case. He looked at me and said, ‚ÄúYou should pinch your nostrils. You don‚Äôt want to smell this.‚Äù

I did as he said. He opened the case but there were no cigarettes within. The little box just had a few seeds the size of a peanut. Hopper pushed the case towards Oswald's face.

The unconscious man opened his eyes, coughing again. ‚ÄúGod, that smells atrocious! Take it away from me!‚Äù he snapped.

Hopper closed the case and slid it back into his coat. ‚ÄúHe's yours,‚Äù he said and left the sitting room.

‚ÄúWhere did he go?‚Äù Oswald asked as the witch hunter entered deeper into the house as if he had been invited.

‚ÄúDon't worry about that,‚Äù I said, the curse channeling card still in my hand. I just kept watching him, trying to gauge how he reacted under my scrutiny.

I knew asking him any direct questions about the murder was pointless. He would only deny or try to distract me from the topic of discussion. I decided to ask him something else instead.

‚ÄúWhat was your aunt like?‚Äù I took a seat opposite him.

His face was blank. His eyes were vacant. He didn't say anything.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou don't want to talk about it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot with you,‚Äù he said tonelessly.

‚ÄúWho else would you talk to about it?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúSamantha,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf she was still alive.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wonder what Samantha would say.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe would console me. She certainly wouldn't treat me like I killed my own parents and my aunt,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe knew I wasn't the kind of man who could kill anyone.‚Äù

I kept my face straight. He had figured out what I was trying to hint at. Well, Hopper and I hadn't really been subtle with how we had treated him so far either. I mean, we had quite literally put him in handcuffs and I was interrogating him.

‚ÄúI guess I'll have to believe Samantha then.‚Äù I shrugged and decided to take another approach. ‚ÄúHow much did this house cost?‚Äù

‚ÄúFive thousand steambolts,‚Äù Oswald said without hesitation.

‚ÄúMust've been hard, saving up that amount with your job,‚Äù I said, not without a hint of sarcasm.

‚ÄúI won a lottery of ten thousand steambolts last year,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI even have the newspaper that announced the prize and the receipt of the lottery office. It's in the bureau in my bedroom. Next to the dresser. Second drawer from the bottom.‚Äù

I called out to Hopper to check for what Oswald had just said. And of course there was the newspaper and the receipt in a file where he had told me. ‚ÄúYou are a lucky man, aren't you?‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù he said without missing a beat. ‚ÄúI lost my parents. Then my aunt. And now the love of my life. That's far from lucky, if you ask me.‚Äù His eyes were still vacant, still numb. I found his relaxed state to be very unsettling.

The curse channeling card was still in my hand. I was starting to feel slightly uncertain about whether or not I wanted to use it on him. On the surface, Oswald did look like a man stuck in the cycle of misfortune and bad luck.

But it was also hard to ignore the fact that Hopper's ederanth powder hadn't affected him. I looked down at the card in my hand again.

This was the only way to find out the truth now. I set the curse channeling card on fire. ‚Äú*Ostendo*.‚Äù

Oswald frowned. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

The flame that was eating up the card turned white in my hand. I threw the burning card towards the man. As the card passed over Oswald‚Äôs head, the entire room turned pitch black.

But I could see him clearly, sitting in the chair a few feet away from me. But then I also saw something else that made me forget how to breathe.

Great red appendages were sticking out of Oswald's torso and reaching down into the inky black ground below us, as if his lower body was a trunk of a grotesque tree and its roots were reaching further below.

The crimson appendages pulsated in a way that made my skin crawl. For a moment, I was convinced that some invisible force was sucking the life out of Oswald. I followed the path of the red outgrowths that were buried deep under the dark ground. As I focused harder, I made out a shape at a great depth below. All the red roots converged like multiple rivers meeting into a bloody ocean.

Except the ocean in this case was a large structure shaped like a teardrop. As I kept watching, I realized something else. The structure was actually an eye.

A terrifying red eye with a black iris at the center. And it didn't stop staring at Oswald even for a second. The red roots pulsated and fed something into the eye and the eye pulsated in response, drinking up voraciously whatever it was consuming.

Then for a split second, the focus of the black iris shifted. The red eye turned to me.

I gasped loudly.

*Clap!*

The blackness disappeared as soon as I clapped. The red roots were gone, so was the great red eye that had just stared into my soul. The curse channeling card was back in my hand. The white flame had extinguished and the card was half burnt.

I didn't realize that I was breathing heavily as I stared down at the card. And my hand was trembling as I held onto it.

Curses liked to feed on human souls in multiple ways. One of their favorite methods of doing that was by triggering the most intense fear one feels about something.

When I casted the *ostendo* curse, I triggered Oswald's deepest fear, revealing his most vulnerable aspect to both him and I. That's why when I looked up at Oswald again, his face was pale and perspiration dotted his forehead. For the first time since I had arrived here, I saw an emotion in Osawald's eyes--fear.

Once my heart stopped racing, I took another deep breath. Whatever that red eye was, it certainly wasn't killing Oswald. But there was no doubt that it was draining something out of him.

Those red roots that were growing out of his body looked like blood veins. But it wasn't blood that was running through them.

I thought over it for a few seconds before another idea struck me. *Sin.* Those pulsating red roots‚Ä¶were feeding Oswald's sins to the giant eye.

I focused on Oswald‚Äôs halo. It was green. Not even a drop of red was visible anywhere on the ring.

‚ÄúMiss Grimly,‚Äù a voice called out.

I jumped in my chair. But it was just Hopper calling for me. He was standing in the hallway behind Oswald, beckoning me towards him. I scrambled out of my chair and followed him inside.

‚ÄúI checked both the floors of the house. There was nothing incriminating or suspicious to be‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúThere won't be!‚Äù I snapped in a hushed whisper.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere's a reason why the ederanth didn't affect Oswald,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSomething is looking out for him. Something very dangerous. That's why even the divinations weren't able to prove him guilty.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou shouldn't have come here,‚Äù a familiar voice spoke up before Hopper could say anything.

We turned to look. Oswald was standing at the mouth of the hallway.

Both his hands were hanging on his sides again. Blood was dripping from his wrists. The handcuffs were gone.

‚ÄúYou had a chance to leave‚Ä¶‚Äù Oswald said. ‚ÄúYou had a chance to live. But you missed it. Oh you missed it so close‚Ä¶‚Äù

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the hell out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

1l1jvor,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1l1jvor/memories_of_a_former_closer/,Memories of a former closer,"Disclaimer: I am no longer a barista, but I ran across this subreddit and it brought back many memories!

2-3 years ago when I was in college, I worked at an independent coffee shop. Great place with excellent coffee that I still come back and drink whenever I'm in my old college town.

Here's some background:

* I mostly worked closing shifts because of school and because I didn't want to wake up at the crack of dawn.
* Most of my coworkers were also college students and I'd say 75% women (including myself).
* This town is known for college football as well as having 50+ bars.  On weekends the bars started getting slammed around 7-8pm, and on home game Saturdays they were packed starting in the morning.
* There was a considerable homeless population - nothing like a big city, but since we were in the downtown area there were tons of homeless folks around. 
* We closed at 10 every night. The last non-closing barista's shift was always scheduled to end at 7 or 8pm depending on the day of the week. The closer would work alone for those last 2 or 3 hours.

Some of my experiences:

* Once I was alone in the store at night with a homeless man who was unwell. Unfortunately this was a super typical situation for me. But this guy in particular was talking angrily to himself about stabbing people. I ended up getting my boyfriend at the time to come to the store and sit with me until I was done closing because I felt so uncomfortable.
* Needles in the bathroom, people hanging in the bathroom for like an hour and coming out super high, etc etc.
* One guy did heroin or something in the bathroom, and came out and nodded off at one of the tables. He was the only other person in the store, and I was busy with closing duties and not paying too much attention. Then an older lady came in to order and asked ""what's up with that guy?"" At that point I noticed he looked like he was half dead (not just typical heroin nodding/sleeping). Before I could do anything she went over and started shaking him and yelling in his face trying to wake him up. He finally woke up after about two minutes of that and stumbled out of the store.
* Drunk men pissing all over the bathroom floor. The nights after home games were the worst for this! Also a lot of people would come in just to throw up in the bathroom and it was 50/50 on whether they attempted to clean it.
* People would clog toilets with random stuff, or shit all over the toilet seat/the floor. Naturally this would always happen after the pre-closer left and I would have to face the consequences alone. 
   * I've since learned from the Starbucks subreddit that they are not allowed to clean bathrooms if it is a biohazard and they have to call someone out to do it. I wish I'd have known this back in my barista days...but I would have been very jealous! 
* On a related note, one night someone clogged the women's toilet with a huge wad of paper towels and a pair of socks (yeah...). I posted in the work group chat to ask if I should just close that bathroom off for the night - it was still busy and I didn't have time to fix it AND take orders/make drinks. My manager responded back with something like ""just plunge it, do you not know how to use a plunger??""

* One home game night, a homeless woman decided I was looking at her in a way she didn't like and started screaming at me while I was pulling shots with a line out the door. Since I was slammed I didn't even notice her until she got up to yell at me, lol. Luckily a few men waiting in line helped diffuse the situation and she left in a huff. 
* One opener in particular decided I was not doing my closing shift work properly. None of the other openers ever said anything and I thought I was one of the more thorough closers. Any time she opened after me, she would send me 5-10 photos of things I missed... stuff like a fleck of espresso grounds on the floor or a single (clean) milk pitcher still on the drying rack. I'd just apologize and move on but once I got fed up and snapped back with the truth ""I was there till 11:30 and someone puked all over the men's room."" She stopped after that.
* We were encouraged to call the non-emergency police number if needed. This was the stock response the few times I asked about safety during closing. They didn't outright discourage calling 911 but the vibe was that non-emergency was sufficient for everything.



Things I'd do differently if I was a barista today

* Call 911. Call it if someone is being belligerent, or looks like they OD'd, or is muttering about stabbing people. Regardless of what the management says about the non-emergency number, just call 911 and don't hesitate to ask for people to be removed if needed. Especially while working at night, alone! Don't be afraid of the optics, your safety is more important!
* Complain about the state of the bathroom especially when working alone. No matter how careful you are, it's still a health hazard to expect one person to thoroughly clean human waste or risk being stabbed by needles and then handle customers' drinks and pastries - while still keeping the line moving. 
* Be more assertive. The pre-closer would always, always try to leave early and I wasn't good at pushing back. Sometimes I'd end up alone from 6:30 to 10 on a busy Friday or Saturday night. 
* Contact the company and inform them about safety issues, and encourage friends/family to do so as well!

  


To coffee shop owners and managers

* If you want to be open late, you need more than one employee. Situations like these could be a huge liability for a company. 
* Look at the area you are serving. The other location of this same store was in a more affluent area of the town. I worked a few shifts there and what do you know - that location had two closers! It also did not receive customers who were intoxicated, or almost any homeless folks or drug users to speak of. On top of that it was way less busy. Spend that labor $ where you need it more!
* Understand that asking your minimum wage employees to be bouncers and social workers is never going to work. Especially if they are women (not that men should either, but we are more at risk in many ways). 
* If your employees can't handle being bouncers (and they can't/shouldn't) sometimes your customers will take it upon themselves to become the bouncers instead - another huge liability and not fair to those customers. 
* Even if you require keys to the bathroom (we did), the 21 year old female barista working alone at 9pm is probably going to give the key to the crackhead if he keeps screaming at her and threatening her.
* Please work at least a few closing shifts and try to have all employees do at least one as well. Sure we got less orders (sometimes...) but the amount of cleaning and prep is a lot, especially when having to watch out for the crazies all by yourself. None of the 5 managers during my time there ever worked a closing or even pre-closing shift.

1l1jpwy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l1jpwy,Old LDS chapels in the rural south,"As someone who grew up in the southern United States (North Carolina specifically), seeing a bunch of small country churches dot the rural landscape has always been a heartwarming sight for me.  I admit that I sometimes get a little envious of my southern brethren because while I worship in a suburban meetinghouse that's nearly identical to every LDS meetinghouse in the nation, they congregate in humble houses of worship that's been cared for for many generations.  However, after a few hours of digging, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that we have a history of ""small country churches"" as well throughout the south.

* Northcutts Cove Chapel: Built in 1909 near Altamont Tennessee, this is the oldest chapel in Tennessee.  It was the headquarters of the East Tennessee conference in the early 20th century.  It even still has it's original bell in the belltower. There's a [short video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=622403646397176) detailing its history if anyone is interested.  Though it is no longer owned by the Church, local members have taken care of this chapel till the present day.  Because of its significance to LDS history in the south, it was added to the National Register in 1979.
* Altamont Tennessee Chapel:  By the 1940s, local membership grew so much that over half of the people in Altamont were members of the Church. Since the Northcutts Cove Chapel could no longer accommodate everybody, a new chapel was built in 1946 and dedicated by Elder Henry D. Moyle.  This chapel was significant because it was built in a prominent location at the main town square (a notable feat outside of the ""Mormon Corridor"").  All of the stone used to build this chapel was gathered from nearby creek beds.  Membership continued to grow in the area for the next 35 years and by 1981, the branch was upgraded into a ward, which required the Church to build [a new meetinghouse](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Church+of+Jesus+Christ+of+Latter-day+Saints/@35.4356774,-85.7380502,3a,75y,8.79h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sKKEjlqZ3TcGG_8Jlef2ljg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D0%26panoid%3DKKEjlqZ3TcGG_8Jlef2ljg%26yaw%3D8.792353!7i16384!8i8192!4m7!3m6!1s0x886119a545be4655:0x4fe1e55d565eb397!8m2!3d35.4360977!4d-85.7379702!10e5!16s%2Fg%2F1td436p0?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) a mile away from the Altamont Chapel.  When the town courthouse burned down in the early 90s, the Altamont Chapel (which was across the street) became a temporary courthouse for the town.  Unfortunately, it looks abandoned today.
* Cumorah Church (Douglas, Georgia):  Though there was a lot of persecution in late 19th century Georgia, missionaries ironically had a lot of success in Coffee County, Georgia.  Joseph Adams, one of the first converts in Coffee County, gave two acres of his farm to the Church, which was used to build a meetinghouse and cemetery in 1907.  Though it was officially named the Douglas Branch Meetinghouse, missionaries nicknamed it the ""Cumorah Church"", and this nickname stuck for local members.  The Douglas Branch worshipped in this building until 1975.  Unfortunately, this chapel was destroyed last year due to Hurricane Helene.

* Magnolia Chapel: Built around 1914, this is the oldest chapel in Alabama.  A [more modern meetinghouse](https://www.ruralswalabama.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Magnolia-Church-of-Latter-Day-Saints_1-95qclclCc2lclcY-z800wTextcl.jpg) was built across from the chapel in 1972 to accommodate growth in the area, but the chapel is still used for local events.  Most of [the interior](https://www.ruralswalabama.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Magnolia-Church-of-Latter-Day-Saints_2b-7qfC-z800wText.jpg) is still original with little to no alterations.  Like other small churches in the south, it has [a small graveyard](https://images.findagrave.com/photos/2011/325/CEM2357534_132200186776.jpg?size=photos1024) in the back.

* Quitman Mississippi Chapel: Built around 1900, this Chapel served Latter-day Saints in Clarke County, Mississippi in the early 20th century.  Also has a graveyard of early members behind the chapel.  Though it's no longer owned by the Church, it is owned by the descendants of those early members (the Quinnelly family).
* Raytown Chapel: Built [in 1906](https://ldsarchitecture.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dsc_0198_adj.jpg), this was one of four chapels that were built in Mississippi that same year.  Out of those four chapels, this is the only chapel left standing (the others were destroyed by arson before 1909).  The Raytown Branch still worships in this building.",19,1748875130.0,latterdaysaints,1,0.95,False
1l1jpul,https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/1l1jpul/monthly_vomiting_am_i_the_only_one/,"Monthly vomiting, am i the only one?","Im not sure if this goes under symptoms or new diagnosis, but here i goo. I‚Äôve had MS for about 5 years (started when i was 16 turning 17, i am now 21) and very recently found out that the funny headaches ive had since, was in fact a migraine. Basically, ive had random days since the new year, february and may where i puke once or twice and have to stay in bed for a couple of days because im completely exhausted. 

The first time i believe is cause of norovirus, im not sure why or what in february, but i know that the incident in may was because i had a migraine attack for multiple days (which was sort of my fault. I ignored my symptoms, woke up at 6am everyday for almost 2 weeks with few breaks so i could work on my home-exam) 

And now, 2 days ago, i went to bed early because of a slight migraine. I woke up at 3am and for unrelated reasons was so pissed off, that it made everything worse. It was the first time i took medicine for migraines and experienced drowsiness from 3-6am, until i woke up again at 11am and had to stay in bed all day. I felt fine in the afternoon, went to bed early, and woke up again at 3am to my stomach hurting and eventually ended up vomiting. I feel like having such a late reaction to migraine medicine is weird considering it was almost 24 hours since taking it and i felt fine before going to bed?

I have never experienced vomiting like this so often (with only a 2 month break from march to april) and its so debilitating both physically and mentally that i feel like im going crazy. I have a doctors appointment over the phone with my MS specialist tomorrow (june 3rd) and have now scheduled a physical consultation with my regular doctor (june 5th) to which he asked if ive had any common denominators related to menstruation, diagnosed celiac disease (i have never had a gluten allergy) weird reactions to coffee (i drink coffee every now and then but not so often) or a burning sensation in my stomach. None of which i have never really given any thought to, but dont think is very relevant. However, all cases have been related to me in high stress situations to the point where i am completely distraught or is school related. 

Ive had regular MR scans about twice a year, and the most recent one from last fall showed no new ‚Äòscars‚Äô and was completely unchanged. Im on birth control (pills), i take creatine to workout which i do 3-4 days a week, and mostly try to keep a good diet (on a student budget thoughüò≠) 

Is it just me that has experienced this? Is it just a migraine or MS-related symptom? Am i so stressed out that i just start vomiting? Should i be worried?",1,1748875126.0,MultipleSclerosis,0,1.0,False

My first month of 2.5, and first week of 5 were fine. I consistantly lost weight, appreciated the reduced food noise and appetite control. I'm now into my 2nd week of 5mg and I'm almost repulsed by food. My body knows its hungry, I get dizzy spells, but as soon as I look at what I used to love (eggs, iced coffee) in the morning or anytime, I just feel yucky. Almost like a hangover, when you know you need to eat but you're so nauseous from the night before so you try to stomach a few bites. Is this what it feels like on normal higher doses?? I've been trying to slowly sip on a protein shake first thing, I learned that drinking it quickly like I used to do just doesn't agree with my stomach any more, but I am still feeling dizzy and just overall blah. I'm happy and thankful that I've been able to lose weight rather quickly, but I really thought I'd enjoy being turned off by food and I don't.

1l1jmza,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l1jmza,[Rum Review #148] Plantation Venezuela 2010 (Under The Sea),"Probably one of the most anticipated or long-awaited rums to review, at least for me. Plantation has always been a renowned brand in the rum world for identifying the best batches and products, purchasing them, aging them in various ways, and then bottling them at relatively high concentrations before releasing them to the market. Of all the rums I've tried, and although I haven't reviewed all of them, I've always been struck by what they can achieve.

In the case of this Venezuelan rum, the bottle identifies the distillery as Sofa. Through a little research, I discovered that this distillery is actually Santa Teresa, which, due to agreements with Bacardi, cannot be identified.

The bottle also indicates that it is a molasses-based rum, fermented for two to three days and finally distilled in columns. Column distillation is not the usual for Plantation rums, but it is for Venezuelan rums. What is not common in Venezuela is such a long fermentation  period, which typically takes 12 to 14 hours. The bottle also states that it is aged for eight years in Aragua, in 200-liter ex-bourbon barrels, and then for four years in France, in 400-liter ex-cognac barrels. Finally, it is bottled at 52% alcohol.

The year 2010 identified on the bottle corresponds to its distillation date. But what most catches my attention is its color, as it's suspiciously yellow with golden tones, while many rums aged in the same place for more or less the same amount of time tend to be more mahogany with orange highlights, especially in bottles that claim no color has been corrected. Finally, the bottle identifies the rum as having 26 esters, 57 grams per hectoliter of volatile compounds, and, most importantly, zero dosage.

Made by: Destiler√≠a Sofa (Santa Teresa)  
Name of the rum: Venezuela 2010 (Under The Sea Series)  
Brand: Plantation (now Planteray)  
Origin: Venezuela / France  
Age: 8 + 4 years  
Price: $90

**Nose:** The nose is completely devoid of fruity aromas, but very abundant with toasted wood, caramel, toffee, honey, and vanilla, and a minimal note of coffee beans. 

**Palate:** I wouldn't call it straightforward on the palate, although many of the notes from the wood and aging are present. Flavors also include vanilla, caramel, honey, and toffee, but it's here that fruit flavors like pineapple and mango come through.

**Retrohale/Finish:** Orange pulp, though not the zest so typical of Venezuelan rum. 

**Rating:** 6 on the t8ke 

**Conclusion:** I'm not sure I'm happy with this expression. I inevitably compare it to Venezuelan rums bottled outside Venezuela and while many of them highlight the best of Venezuelan rum, this Plantation seems to emphasize other flavors and aromas that aren't as typical of Venezuelan rum, let alone a Venezuelan rum that has spent 12 years in barrels. In a way, it feels like a young rum, albeit without the aggressiveness of the alcohol. If you've never had Venezuelan rum, this would not be a good reference point.

* Loses it if you skip breakfast  
* Craves sugar like a K-drama binge at 3 PM  
* Makes a whole scene over nothing (read: *minor blood sugar dips*)  

You know her. We *all* know her.

# üîç Signs She‚Äôs Flipping Out:

* You‚Äôre eyeing that biscuit like it‚Äôs your last lifeline  
* Suddenly tired, cranky, and wondering why your jeans shrunk (they didn‚Äôt. **She‚Äôs bloated.**)  
* Brain fog so thick, you forget what you walked into the kitchen for  

# ‚úÖ How to Keep Her Zen (And You Sane):

# üç≥ 1. Breakfast = Non-Negotiable

Your coffee isn‚Äôt breakfast. Neither is a sad banana. Give her *real food*, like:

* **Besan chilla + green chutney** ‚Äì[ protein-packed](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/1457496846000195462/176427248622163414#) and totally desi  
* **Eggs + roti** ‚Äì no fancy stuff, just good fuel  

# üç≤ 2. Eat in This Order = Game Changer

Start your meals with **sabzi + dahi**, then move to carbs. It slows[ sugar](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/1457496846000195462/176427248622163414#) spikes and keeps cravings quiet. üßòüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

# üåø 3. Cinnamon = Your Spice Rack‚Äôs Hidden Hero

A tiny sprinkle does big things. Add to:

* Chai ‚òï  
* Oats ü•£  
* Coffee or fruit üçé  





# When Sugar Cravings Hit... Do This First!

Instead of panicking (or inhaling a dozen biscuits), try:

* **2 dates + 5 almonds** ‚Äì sweet + crunch = happy brain üß†  
* **1 square dark**[ **chocolate**](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/1457496846000195462/176427248622163414#) **+ 1 tsp peanut butter** ‚Äì yes, you're allowed  
* **Chia pudding with coconut milk** ‚Äì fancy if you're feeling extra  

**Real Talk: This Isn‚Äôt About Willpower**

It‚Äôs not you. It‚Äôs your **hormones**. When insulin‚Äôs out of whack, your body *asks* for sugar like a toddler asks for candy‚Äî**loudly**.

Feed her right, and she‚Äôll calm down. *Promise.* üíó

**Bottom Line:**

You‚Äôre not on a ‚Äúdiet.‚Äù You‚Äôre just **outsmarting your hormones**.

And trust me‚Äîwhen **insulin‚Äôs happy**, *everything* feels easier. üíÅüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú®

* It‚Äôs 2 AM and your brain‚Äôs replaying that awkward thing you said in 2015  
* You snap at your partner for chewing too loudly (been there)  
* That family WhatsApp group is *this close* to getting blocked  

# ‚úÖ How to Help Him Chill:

* **Ashwagandha latte:** Warm milk + ashwagandha + honey = liquid Xanax (but tastier) üòå  
* **Snack intervention:** Swap chips for roasted makhana (same crunch, zero guilt)  
* **Lunch rebellion:** Eat before 2 PM, even if your boss says *""after this meeting""*  

üí° *Life hack:* Try the ""5-minute stare into space"" after meals. No phone. No thoughts. Just you and your food coma.

That one intern who moves slower than government paperwork? That‚Äôs your **Thyroid**.

* You‚Äôre wearing sweaters in April while others fan themselves  
* Hair‚Äôs falling out more than your motivation on Mondays  
* Your metabolism moves like Mumbai local at rush hour üöÇ  

# ‚úÖ How to Motivate Her:

* **Brazil nuts:** Just 2/day = selenium boost (like giving your intern a coffee voucher)  
* **Coconut oil:** Cook with it‚Äîyour Malayali friend's mom would approve  
* **Veggie hack:** Lightly saut√© greens instead of sad raw salads  

**4. Estrogen & Progesterone ‚Äì The Drama Queen Aunties üíÖüé≠**

Those two aunties who live for gossip? Yep, that‚Äôs these hormonal divas.

# üîç When They‚Äôre Feuding:

1l1jkl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1l1jkl3/mil_wants_me_to_get_over_dying/,MIL wants me to get over dying,"I apologize in advance for how lengthy this will be. 

I met my MIL in 2017 and we became friends. I'm talking hang out for hours every day talking and having coffee, family dinners, birthdays, all of it. I met her without knowing she was the mother of my friend (now husband). He was married to someone else for a couple of years, and MIL was not kind to her. Their relationship had always been strained so when MIL would complain about ex wife, it seemed to make sense. I was 19-20 at the time. Around then, MIL began cheating on her spouse. I heard about it from numerous people and just asked them to not share that with me. MIL began to tell me in detail about who she was with and details. She told me I was not allowed to tell DH (mind you, we were just friends at this point). I was uncomfortable with this as I also had a close relationship with MIL's husband, FIL. I told her to not tell me about this stuff anymore. She continued, so when she would start up I could leave the coffee shop we frequented. 

Shortly after this, I went into cardiac arrest at said coffee shop and died. According to the people who were alive at the time, I stopped talking, turned blue, and slumped. Two lovely men immediately began CPR and are ultimately the reason I am alive today. MIL called my mom and told her that I had an ""incident"" and would be going to the hospital. MIL told my mom it was just a seizure and paramedics were present. My mom said she asked some more questions and then asked MIL if the paramedics were working on me. MIL hesitated and said yes. Skip to the hospital, my parents, step dad, and brother are in the family waiting area. At this point I am alive but only by legal definition. My family is silent, and MIL and FIL are present. MIL sends FIL to get tacos for her and proceeds to eat and laugh and tell stories while my carcass is just a couple rooms over. There is photo evidence of this. 

I was placed in a coma and everyone had to tiptoe around my body. MIL brought people from the coffee shop to my room to see my carcass. These were people that I did not know. My mom realized pretty quickly that the vibes were off and shut the sideshow down and sent MIL home. 

I survived this ordeal with a great bit of trauma and it does impact my daily life 6 years later. 

MIL divorced FIL and moved out of town with a boyfriend. FIL passed in 2022. MIL has since moved back to town without the boyfriend. 

Today, I am married to said friend and MIL is my MIL. I am currently 35 weeks pregnant with our first and only baby, B. We shared the news with our mothers at 4 weeks. I am not a person that likes to be touched, MIL knows this, has had the firm boundary set with her in the past. She chose to immediately lunge forward to put her hand on my stomach. That was corrected, we all moved on. Whatever. 

Christmas 2024 comes, spouse and I host. I plan a dinner of lasagna and such in honor of my stepdad who had passed that year. At this point I am also in my first trimester and sick as a dog. We hosted spouse's out of town brother and husband for almost 2 weeks. There were numerous fights between family members but I stayed out of those. MIL went grocery shopping with spouse and while out, they changed the dinner plan to a traditional Christmas dinner. I told spouse no, I'm not okay with that, tell her no and she can host her own dinner if she wants to. Spouse did that, we had a lasagna dinner that spouse spent hours cooking. MIL showed up, had lasagna, and then left. 

After Christmas, I did not hear from MIL for several months. During my 2nd trimester, it became clear that I was very high risk and I began seeing several specialists on top of my OB. Spouse lost his job. We move to a new house I was in social work which is not a mellow job. Spouse gets a new job after a couple months, i have a complete mental break at work, spouse and I agree that I should quit and I did, immediately. 3rd trimester begins, I begin seeing MFM regularly, three different cardiologists regularly, echos, EKG's, weekly ultrasounds, the works. I'm constantly touched out and overstimulated. But I'm still in regular therapy (8 years strong from my childhood trauma)

Spouse and I hosted Easter. Just my mom, brother, and MIL. MIL asks what she can bring. Spouse and I are cooking everything. I told spouse I didn't care what she brought, it wasn't a big dinner and she can bring the corn if she'd like. She did not like. She wanted to bring corn pudding. Spouse told her I don't eat that. She asked when I would get over my picky eating. I told spouse I don't care if she brings it, there are always items at dinners that I don't eat. She arrives exactly on time with corn pudding, tells me I'm so big, and doesnt speak to me for the remainder of the dinner. Mind you, my tum is measuring very small and I do not look as far along as I am, even now. MIL had been told prior to not make comments on my size.

Skip to baby shower time. My mom is leading the charge and brings my aunts, best friend, and MIL into a group chat to discuss all kinds of bows and pink things for the baby shower. My mom tells everyone what needs to be done and asks if people are willing to do this or that. Most people take a task or two, my mom and best friend handle majority. MIL is tasked with ordering tables and chairs. She does, we're happy. At the shower, I was feeling exhausted and irritable. We later found out this was from a decreased ejection fraction. I went from 52% to 38%. Anyhow, I'm talking to everyone as my mom instructed. MIL is hiding out in our kitchen, speaking only with our friend's mother. They go on a smoke walk during the games. Numerous people told me that they herd her muttering not nice things about me throughout the shower. I said oh well, rude. My kitchen now reeks of weed. MIL probably didn't smoke it, but the friend's  mom did. Oh well, rude. She isn't invited back to anything. MIL Irish exits after gifts are opened. She told spouse she didn't say bye to me because I was talking to someone. I was not. She told me she didn't say goodbye because she was tired. Oh well. 

A week later, we find find out my heart is not pleased with baby and may need to deliver at 35 weeks. New specialist visit, wants me to get to the 37 week mark we originally agreed upon. If anything worsens, I go to hospital. Fine. I'm grumpy about this news. Hospitals and medical settings are deeply upsetting to me due to my history, but this will be over so soon. I talk to spouse about having MIL around for passive quality time. It's important to me that baby B has the chance to develop relationships with her relatives. You can never have enough people to love your kiddo. MIL does not want to be here, okay. My therapist and I discuss leaving doors open but not dragging people through. I'm learning these life skills and practicing them carefully. 

We set two rules: Covid booster and Tdap vaccine within the last 10 years, and no smoking then holding baby. MIL tells spouse that these rules are only about her. Whatever, he can deal with that. MIL finally gets vaccinated. We requested she not smoke while at our house during the first trimester. First day at new house, she hides behind our garage and smokes. I smell the smoke pulling into my house through all the open windows. Spouse makes her put it out. We later find out that she told our friend she ""wasn't allowed to smoke at the house"" and did it anyway. My lack of trust in her solidifies. 

Spouse and I want to fix the relationship for baby B's sake. That brings me to yesterday. She had some items for B. She mentions bringing them to our house, I want that to happen so we can start having casual, normal interactions before B arrives in two weeks. Spouse and MIL meet at MIL's fav bar instead. Oh well, no biggie. After that we go to my mom's birthday dinner and it's pleasant enough. On the way home, spouse and I are talking. He had let the c section date slip in conversation. We weren't sharing with anyone due to my trauma and desire to not have anyone at the hospital. I am already registered as a private patient. Spouse and MIL are talking about the hospital visit and he informs her that we won't be having visitors due to my trauma. MIL then says ""she needs to get over it."" 

So that's how I lost my mind. I told spouse I did not want her in my house or around the baby until further notice, and we will check in once we get through the post-partum scaries. We had a long talk about everything that has occurred with MIL, more than I shared here. These are just the top stories for me. I slept on it, and now I write this looking for advice from those who have an outside perspective. I'm in the middle of it, so I'm biased. I want full no contact until further notice. No big declaration, just silence. Spouse has already talked to her countless times about treating me like a person. I desire a neutral relationship between me and her. I do not want to tell spouse not to talk to his mother. I believe in letting people do what they're going to do. But I've also been instructed by the doctors to chill out and keep my stress to a zero. This does not help.

Am I overreacting to gently, quietly close the door for a while?

1l1jkhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1l1jkhk/need_bravery_to_leave_narc_enmeshed_husband/,Need bravery to leave narc enmeshed husband,"I am a (35F) married to a (38M) narc mama's boy foreign national and we are currently living in his country. We have an infant daughter and an unhinged MIL who's displaying very clear potential of getting down and dirty in a custody battle as she has already appointed herself as the primary caretaker of my child and lives almost full time in my home.

In case you are questioning how I managed to get myself into this hot mess, here's a little background to my story, bring a coffee as this might take a while.

I met my seemingly loving husband while he was working as an expat in my home country. For a full year of dating, there had been no red flags whatsoever, nothing to look out for such as love bombing etc. When our relationship started getting serious, he asked me to fly out to his country to meet his parents, whom at the time, struck me as a polite elderly couple who seemed to have done an excellent job at raising this fine gentleman. Little did I know, I was getting a mini introduction to the triangulated, enmeshed hell ran by my covert malignant narc MIL .

I flew back home, he proposed, I accepted and I can say that it was during that time that the mask started to slip. I didn't believe it at first but looking back in retrospect, that was the time I should've called things off. MIL started getting overly involved in wedding prep, which I chalked down to us having a destination wedding with her living at the destination so it made sense for her to handle the logistics, which I was grateful for. But the first alarm bell rang when she came to visit us in our home, pre wedding, and I came back from work one day to find my kitchen rearranged, my curtains shortened (like legit sewed) and my decorations removed and replaced with stuff she brought from her country. I sat there seething at how my soon to be husband didn't see anything problematic with his mom's behavior (here's the part where he's enmeshed) and questioned how ungrateful I was to reject her ""help"" with settling us.

Fast forward to our wedding, she throws a fit and asks us to go sleep at her house the next day. My husband asks me if that's OK and that his mom really misses him, I am about to vomit at this point but I tell myself 1) We do not live in this country so we will be very low contact with her going forward 2) I love my husband and I don't want to be rude to his family so I accept and we go the next darn day. Come morning, she barges into our bedroom without so much as courteous knock, my husband flips and he yells at her. And I just knew it in my gutt, at this moment, beyond the shadow of doubt, that I married a mama's boy. Sickening.

Over the years, we kept going back for visits to his home country (where MIL lives) and it was for a very short duration, during that time, we would always have explosive fights instigated by her over involvement in our lives but my husband never put 2 and 2 together.

It wasn't until last year when we announced we were expecting our first that shit quite literally hit the fan. Suddenly, there was a sense of urgency for my husband to move back home ""for this great new job"" which ended up entailing moving a very pregnant woman (myself) to my MIL's home temporarily till we find our own accommodation. Dumbest thing I have ever agreed to, but you can only imagine the amount of emotional blackmail I have endured to finally succumb to entering the lion's den.

Pre, during and after birth I have endured all colors of abuse you can possibly think of. I have been locked in the house under the guise of ""you're very pregnant I won't let you go on a walk alone what if you fall?"" to her squeezing my breasts to ""help me breastfeed"". I was in a postpartum daze, to say I underreacted is an understatement. I had clogged milk ducts and was unable to breastfeed my 4 day old, I requested formula from my husband, but she talked him out of it saying that when cows have clogged ducts, the farmers squeeze them even if they bleed. I got hospitalized that night.

I complained to my husband about MIL being unhinged, and taking my infant daughter by force from my arms, kissing her and making her sick at 13 days old, bulldozing me in every way possible. He attempted some pathetic boundaries but didn't want to disappoint dear mommy by not sharing her first grand child.

At that point, I was knee deep in the mud, we had already quit our jobs, were in transition for the new jobs in his home country and had an infant to fend for so I needed to stay. He had also convinced me to transfer my savings to his account as I did not have an account in said country (financial abuse), so I was locked in good.

I have gone back to work after my maternity leave and after extensive therapy I am now able clearly identify that I have been and still am a victim of intimate partner violence perpetrated by MIL through enmeshed husband.

I asked for divorce several times, the last time my husband threatened to take my child. I live in his country (3rd world where the justice system is questionable at best) and I have no idea what he has cooked up for me. My therapist referred me to local legal counsel and they said they cannot legally obtain custody in my case without proving I committed a crime.

I am lost and I am drowning. Please tell me I can leave him.

***Ever since the below happened, I've been down the attachment theory rabbit hole. I'd appreciate some insight into whether what happened is indicative of an avoidant. This is so I can better inform whether I could have reasonably done something better or if I'm going crazy.***

  
A few days ago me (33m) and my gf (32f) of nearly 6 months broke apart. She broke up with me. The manner of it left me confused and, honestly, hurt at a psychological level. To preface; In the 5 and half months of knowing her the relationship felt so much more meaningful and the connection felt so much more intense then it ever did in my previous relationship which was 4 years long.

From the start, the charm hit me like a truck and for the first 4 months she showered me in praise. She would often compare me to her ex and say how much different and better I am. Specifically she mentioned that she isn't used to someone that actually wants to spend time with her. She would consistently say things like ""I never knew what it was like to be in a good relationship until now"" and call me perfect, tell me how much she likes having me around and that I'm free to come around hers whenever I want. I completely reciprocated the endearment she heaped on me and I poured so much energy into her. She was often overwhelmed with work, looking after her 1 year old child (who she had with the previous ex) and I would always come around and help clean up the house, mow her lawn ect. She told me she likes how I look after her.When it came to mobile comms, she prewarned me right at the start that she is a terrible texter. For me this wasn't an issue and she would often leave me on read for the majority of the day before she got back to me and I wouldn't bat an eyelid. But we always made some form of communication atleast once a day. She would often go out cycling, see her friends and family and quite often I would accommodate last minute changes to something we had planned together so she can cycle on a sunnier day. The sex was amazing. Everything felt balanced and normal.

We had our first holiday for 5 days in April. It was physically exhausting. The bed was rigid so sleep quality was poor, especially for her and we were constantly ascending/descending old Italian stepways each day.The first night back on a sunday I told her I'd spend at mine to give us space to decompress away from each other. We ended up spending the majority of the week apart just to give each other space.The following weekend I stayed the night at hers and she blew up at me halfway through the night shouting at me she can't sleep because I'm here. I calmly offered to leave and she said no she doesn't want me to leave. Following morning she blows up at me again shouting at me if I want breakfast. I literally started sobbing while she calmly started feeding her baby his breakfast. She didn't even acknowledge how upset I was by the outbursts. I just grabbed my things and left. She was so cold and emotionless.

Stupid me reached out later with understanding and I explained that I get shes feeling overwhelmed but i asked if she understands why I was upset. She apologised for being grumpy (grumpy is understating it) and invited me around. At hers I sat down and I brought up the topic of space. I asked her if she required more space away from me and she assured me that's not the problem and it's the lack of sleep she has been having. I took her word for it but made a conscious effort anyway to trim back how many nights a week to spend with her.From there on the relationship got progressively more hot and cold. Texts increasingly became less frequent. I would more often than not be left on read. But she more frequently phoned so I didn't think much of it. She was a lot less reassuring with me. The sex was still happening though and she would always open up with reassurance post sex. One night she told me she loved me and I reciprocated.

The past couple of weeks things got weird. She would make nasty jabs at me. I'm self conscious about my hair (it's thin) and she made fun of it while we were at dinner. A couple of times I phoned her and she would reply saying she meant to phone me but decided she would rather do something else. I fucking hate myself for not standing up for myself then and there.

The second to last phonecall I ever had with her she told me she had been feeling down all week. She brought up what it would look like if we moved in together. She mentioned losing her space and freedom. She complained about having to look after her child more because the ex bf was working longer days and how that affected her cycling routine. I reasoned with her that if we move in together, she would actually have more freedom because I would help take up the burden of childcare, walking the dog and maintaining the house which will free her to do the things she loves. And she would have space because I still have work and I want to train myself. She ended up sounding very agreeable to it. We had plans for that following weekend but I offered her space for the weekend which she declined. This would be our last weekend together. On the Sunday I woke up feeling down with this gut-wrenching feeling. I left for work that afternoon and I sent her a messaging apologising for being down which she responded by suggesting I was just bored with her. Which wasn't the case.For the rest of that week she pretty much ghosted me. I had no comms from her all week. I only sent her one message telling her I miss her and hope she's doing okay. I knew she had an overnight volunteer trip on Wednesday night with work, and she had mentioned she would be home Thursday afternoon. I returned home from work Thursday night and phoned her, but she didn't answer.

So I chose to go around to hers and knock on her door. She approached the door and when she saw it was me, she u-turned and went to the kitchen at the back. I went around to the side door and knocked on the door where I could see she was in the kitchen pretending I wasn't there. It really fucking hurt. But at that point I knew it was over and I said through the door I want my stuff. She grabbed all my stuff then came back and opened the door. She let me in where she told me she's breaking up and I asked why to which she said I don't give her space and it's stressing me out. She criticised me for coming around uninvited and I defended myself saying I haven't heard from her all week and I'm coming around as a responsible partner to see if you're okay. I asked her when she decided to leave me, and she literally pondered for a minute as if she was trying to remember some casual occasion. She was so cold and emotionless. I asked her if there was somebody else (I shouldn't have.) She said no. I told her I really liked her and I'm sad this has ended and left.I made the mistake of messaging her the next morning saying I don't want to end on a rough note, and we should talk about things over a coffee. She asked what that would achieve and I replied mutual understanding. If space was the issue, we should really have sat down earlier and discussed.

She replied in the most demeaning and degrading way possible. Took everything she accepted about me at the start and used it against me. I defended myself saying I offered her space multiple times and called her out for calling me a loser even though she told me the whole time about how perfect I am. I wished her peace and happiness and that was my last message to her.She sent another message 10 minutes after that which I have left unread. But from the notification bar I can see it is full of contempt and hate. That she's relieved and she the reassurance she gave me the whole time was just to make me happy.

The whole thing has left me so unsettled. I feel like I can't enter another relationship as the same person.",1,1748874709.0,AvoidantBreakUps,4,1.0,False

My bf (17M) and I (17F) started talking about a month and a half ago. I met him through a mutual friend who obviously didn't know enough about him or she would've never set us up. 

We initially hit it off very well, my bf (let's call him jack) was sweet and funny and we had the same views on life which is very important to me. About a week ago, I asked when he'd be free next and he told me he was grounded but would be fine to hang out in a couple days so we made plans to hang out then. I picked Jack up from his house (he doesn't have a car - keep this in mind) and we went to some of my favorite weekend hangout spots. 

We had a great time and he eventually asked me to be his girlfriend, to which I said ""of course"". About an hour into our coffee date he gets a phone call from his mom, and after hanging up, asks me to come over for dinner since his mom had invited me. Sure, I felt like it was a little soon to meet his parents but free food is free food lol. 

We went back to his place and as soon as I walked in his mom thanked me for ""giving him a chance"" which I awkwardly smiled back and replied with a confused ""no problem?"". His parents asked us what we had done that afternoon. I told them about the art fair we went to as well as the coffee shop. His mom chuckles and goes ""that seems like a lot of driving for just today, you're gonna get sick of that soon"". I was confused. ""Well all he needs to do is save up to get a car, right? He told me he has his license"" she stares at me, looks over at jack and asks ""you seriously didn't tell her?"" He goes silent and shakes his head no. I said ""tell me what??"" ""I'm going to tell her if you don't"" she said, but he continued to stare blankly at the floor. 

""Do you know why Jack wasn't able to hang out ?"" she asked. ""Yeah he said he was grounded."" I replied. ""No,"" she said ""he was on house arrest. He just got out of juvie three months ago. They revoked his license till he's 21."" I sat there, stunned. I looked over at him, and he was still avoiding eye contact with me. I stood up, excused myself from the table, and went home. 

Jack called me several times on my drive home but I ignored him. I had asked several times if he had a criminal history which he profusely denied.  (one of my ex bfs had a manslaughter charge he hid from me for over a year so I'm very picky about this.) I foolishly believed him and I was sitting in the car thinking to myself ""how could I be so stupid to make it official so soon. I literally know nothing about him"" I got home, turned my phone on dnd, and went to sleep. 

The next morning we had a long talk. I asked him for the truth which he reluctantly gave me. He told me about how he'd got into gang activity a while back and that after this most recent incident put him in juvie that he's actively trying to leave. I asked him to elaborate on the ""incident"" which took a little prying but he finally spit it out after about five minutes of trying to convince him.

He told me about the ""quotas"" he had to fulfill to stay a functioning member of the gang and how he needed to deal all sorts of drugs; oxy, heroin, coke, LSD, Xanax, weed, fentanyl, you name it. He'd been doing this for months but he got caught that time because him and his friends, while high on god knows what, decided to STEAL A CAR. How fucking asinine is that? I told him there was absolutely no excuse for this kind of behavior, not his upbringing, not peer pressure, and that he is entirely at fault since he was not only compliant in this, but he was the one driving the car. 

I hung up the phone and ignored him for the rest of the night where the in the morning I woke up to multiple paragraphs. He was talking about how much he loved me, how much he wanted to be with me, blah blah blah. I ignored it and went to work. I texted him when my shift about six hours later but no reply. I figured jack was over chasing me which honestly, I felt relieved about. But the next day, still nothing, and I was starting to get worried. When we had our long talk he told me he was going to officially leave the gang before I hung up. I initially didn't believe him but now I was worried. Did he get shot? I went on to spend my entire 12 hr shift that day worrying about him.

Two hours before my shift ends, I get a phone call from an unknown number which I ignored per the usual, but then I got a text from the same number ""it's Jacks mom. Call me asap"". I went into the back and called her. ""Hes in the hospital"" she said. My stomach dropped and I started to panic. I asked what had happened and she says ""he's physically alright, but after you left a few days ago he started to spiral and last night we had to send him to the hospital for not only his safety but ours as well. This happens quite often."" 

I was shocked, he has seemed so gentle and sweet but then again, he hid the fact that he's affiliated and a drug dealer from me so, what else is new? I asked how he was doing and she told me he was barely hanging on. I asked how long he was going to be in there for and she said a few weeks but visiting hours should be open soon and I needed to go see him. I paused for a second, and said ""I don't know if I feel safe around him anymore"". ""I understand that"" she replied ""but you also need to understand that he has been getting so much better now that you are around. He wants to change. He wants to be better for YOU. You are the only reason he's hanging on"" I sat there with the phone in my hand, again, mouth agape. Did this grown woman seriously just put her only son's mental and physical well being on my shoulders?

I have no idea who he is or anything about him and we've only been official for three days. I can't handle chaos like this right now especially with everything that's going on at home. He scares me on top of these gigantic lies and excuses  would I be the asshole for leaving him while hes in the mental hospital?",2,1748874540.0,AITA_Relationships,3,0.75,False

I have my 2 female mice coming home tmr :3 more sprays are on their way. Most enrichment is buried for them to burrow and find. The enclosure is 30‚Äù, 17‚Äù, 12‚Äù. These girls are already very comfortable with me and my partner, as I we‚Äôve been working with them in my animal science class for 2 months. Not pictured is a wooden bendable bridge I will have and 1 more hide. to make the transition from one enclosure to another easier, I will be transferring some of their old bedding and I will not be wiping down their bridge or hide just so their sent remains. Me and my girlfriend also rubbed our scent all over the bedding. To help them further with this change I put extra food and sprays in the enclosure so I won‚Äôt have to disrupt them for a few days and stress them out. They are use to being handled and even jump right onto our hands.

Some highlights of the enclosure:

- buried box with cardboard paper texture inside, with food, chews, and other varied things that they need to first discover, then pull out in order to use. 

- multiple different sprays, some bigger ones buried for them to drag out.

- big log in cage counts as a different enriching texture for them

- climbing and chewing opportunities, more will be added in the future when we have the wood platform

- about 9ish inches of bedding

- cardboard tea box stuffed with paper coffee filters, one of them has Cheerio and baby puff wrapped as well as a nutrition pellet. I‚Äôm trying to get them as interested as posssible in the nutrition pellets  

- 2 different hides, one slightly buried and the other hidden with tissues in it

- scatter feeding + regular bowl ( 100% nutrition mix as well as pellets )

- 75% hemp bedding 25% paper, both dust free. 


Let me know how I did. We are so excited for the gals to come home! Because my mice are through the school, they didn‚Äôt have the biggest enclosure when we worked with them. We kept it as cluttered as possible though and were so excited to see what they do with these new opportunities!

I'm planning to try the carnivore diet for one month to see if it helps with a few chronic health issues I've been dealing with:

Recurring folliculitis

Hidradenitis suppurativa

Ulcerative proctitis


I'm not doing this to lose weight ‚Äî if anything, I‚Äôd like to gain some weight and improve overall healing.

My plan is simple and pretty strict:

Steak and ground beef

Eggs

Black coffee

Seasonings (basic ones like salt, pepper, maybe garlic powder)

Vitamin D supplement


Has anyone here tried carnivore for similar issues? I‚Äôve seen scattered anecdotes but would love to hear more focused experiences ‚Äî especially around skin/gut healing or weight gain on carnivore.

Also: Any red flags in my plan? Anything I should be adding or watching out for?

Considering I live in a major city, the pay is decent and we get good tips. Coworkers are great, I like my hours, and I don‚Äôt mind the busy shifts. But I can‚Äôt stand the owner. They micromanage, get angry at us for standing around when we‚Äôre gathering ourselves after crazy rushes, keep trying to make us go faster, and don‚Äôt give us any free drinks or pastries. They even make us pay for tea if we‚Äôre feeling under the weather and it‚Äôs only a 10% employee discount.¬†

Anytime I‚Äôm on my phone, they come over to check my screen. They think they‚Äôre being slick, but it‚Äôs so obvious what they‚Äôre doing. If I drink something made by mistake, they‚Äôll keep staring at the cup in my hand but won‚Äôt say anything to me. And to make things worse, they don‚Äôt know much about coffee, but will randomly join us on bar, messing up our flow, to try and act like a hot shot barista (but then ask one of us to steam the milk for them because they don‚Äôt know how). Or they‚Äôll tell us to make them the most complicated, quad-shot drink during a rush and then go sit somewhere to ‚Äúrest‚Äù while we‚Äôre slammed.

They put on a front about taking care of each other and creating a safe/community-like atmosphere but their actions show that they don‚Äôt give a crap about us.¬†

The barista industry is competitive in my city, so it‚Äôs not easy to get a new gig, especially not one as accessible as this. I‚Äôm going to keep working here because the only thing I dislike about this job is my boss. I made a list of feedback to tell them since they lOveEEeeeEEee feedback, but DAMN, I needed to get this off my chest. Thank you for your time ‚úåÔ∏è",6,1748874356.0,barista,1,1.0,False

Like, don‚Äôt talk to him before his first cup kind of person. üòÑ For the past few years, he‚Äôs also been trying to lose a bit of weight‚Äîmostly around his midsection‚Äîbut nothing seemed to stick.

He‚Äôs not into fad diets or gym memberships, but he walks every morning and tries to eat reasonably well. Still, the scale barely moved.

In early February, my cousin (who‚Äôs big into supplements) told him about this little powder you stir into your coffee. It‚Äôs supposed to support metabolism and help with energy‚Äîwithout changing anything else. My dad was skeptical (aren‚Äôt we all?), but figured, ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm drinking coffee anyway, why not?‚Äù

He started using it in mid-February, just adding it to his usual cup each morning. No big diet change, no new workout‚Äîjust the usual walking. But after about three weeks, he said he wasn‚Äôt feeling as hungry during the day. By mid-March, he‚Äôd dropped around 7 pounds. Nothing dramatic, but his clothes were fitting better, and he was feeling encouraged.

The best part? He said his energy was more stable‚Äîno afternoon crashes like before. Last I checked (this was late April), he was down nearly 14 pounds and still using the same routine.

The flavor didn‚Äôt mess with his coffee, which was his biggest concern. It just blended right in.

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs some magic fix, but if you already drink coffee every day and want to try a small change, it might be worth a shot. It helped my dad more than any of us expected.",1,1748874354.0,TrueFitStories,1,1.0,False

			Do you rap in waves or rap in chains?

I‚Äôm currently using a Nespresso Citiz and looking to upgrade to a proper bean-to-cup machine. I mainly drink espresso and I‚Äôm looking for better coffee quality compared to capsules.

I‚Äôm choosing between two De‚ÄôLonghi models, and they cost the same where I live:

* Rivelia ‚Äì compact, dual bean hopper (Bean Switch), automatic milk system
* Magnifica Plus ‚Äì larger, touchscreen, also has automatic milk features

I only drink milk-based drinks occasionally, so milk features are a nice bonus but not essential. I care more about espresso quality, ease of use, and long-term reliability.

Are there any other machines around this price (or a bit higher) that are actually worth it over these two?

Also:

If I use bottled water, how often would descaling be needed? Is it difficult to do?

* Are the internal components (brew unit, grinder, etc.) actually durable on these models?

Appreciate any insights or experience, thanks!",1,1748874162.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

1l1j95w,https://www.reddit.com/r/etymology/comments/1l1j95w/couldthe_diminutive_suffix_i_from_tupian/,"Couldthe diminutive suffix ""-iÃÉ"" from Tupian languages have influenced the reduction from ""-iÃÉ…≥ ä"" to ""-iÃÉ‚Åø"" in some dialects of Brazilian Portuguese?","Well. So the question is exactly the one in the title. The diminutive suffix in portuguese is ""-inho"" (pronounced something like -iÃÉ.…≥ ä). It certainly comes from the Latin suffix ""-ƒ´nus"" (iÀê.n äs). In certain dialects of Brazilian Portuguese though (Mineiro and Sertanejo more notably), this suffix is reduced to a simple -in (pronounced -iÃÉ‚Åø).   
  
As an example you'd have:   
\- caf√© (k…ë.f…õ'): coffee   
\- caf√©zinho (k…ë.f…õ.ziÃÉ.…≥ ä): the standard diminutive -- a little coffee, a small coffee   
\- caf√©zin (k…ë.f…õ.ziÃÉ‚Åø): the diminutive as someone from Minas Gerais, or the interior of S√£o Paulo, or Goi√°s might pronounce it.   
  
Now, if we go to the Tupian languages, they have a very similar suffix for diminutives: a simple -iÃÉ. As an example:   
  
\- tam√£dua (ta.m√£Àà‚Åø.d ∑a): anteater   
\- tam√£duaiÃÉ (ta.m√£Àà‚Åø.d ∑aiÃÉ): a smaller species of anteater.   
  
(I'm not super sure of those syllable boundaries, I'm not a Tupi speaker) 

The question is, finally: the dialects of Brazilian portuguese where -inho reduces to -in are known to a have its phonetics and vocabulary influenced by indigenous languages. Could this be another influence? Do anyone know of research in this aspect?   
  
IOH, it's so similar!!! OTOH, reducing -iÃÉ.…≥ ä to -iÃÉ‚Åø simply by losing some unstressed vowel and reducing a consonant doesn't sound like it demands it.   
  
I don't hope to find anyone specialized in this here, but it would be very nice if anyone have any clue.

This is completely opposite of what I've heard about Silverton for years, and I'm wondering what's changed? We'd always heard about unfriendly, conservative, clique-ish people but for the most part people seem very welcoming. And at least downtown, we've seen LGBTQ couples and people of color who are definitely residents, are friendly and seem happy there. Am I missing something? Is it changing or am I only seeing a really small portion of the population who lives there?  Because I'd love to live near a downtown like that.

When it does this it fails to make coffee and lets steam out the vents. After many cleans and descales I tried changing the flow meter. I now haven‚Äôt got the error (which was intermittent anyway), but it struggles to flow coffee, like it‚Äôs clogged, or too dense. Water only flows fine. I‚Äôve tried making grind coarser, and other beans. 

Some online reading suggests the pump, but as it flows water fine I thought the pump seems ok.

It's coffee, pastries, and sandwiches and I can never get out of there in less than 15 minutes. And because it's always low ticket items, the customers tip almost nothing. I think I'm going to have to just start declining all orders for this place. It literally cost me money to go in and wait 20 minutes to pick up 2 orders to be delivered 15 minutes away for a total $8.

1) Do you have any spots that you just automatically decline?

2) Should I call and talk to the manager about how their decisions and setup make serving their customer untenable for us? She's very friendly. I'm sure she's not doing anything malicious. And I'm sure this is just because our struggles can't/shouldn't/won't ever occur to her unless someone points them out. ",5,1748873901.0,doordash_drivers,26,1.0,False
