1r8p90u,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1r8p90u/am_i_over_reacting_need_opinionsadvice/,Am I over reacting?? Need opinions/advice!!,"So my best friend’s birthday was a few weeks ago. She planned an out of town getaway for a group of her friends. 

I love her so much and wanted to make sure she felt special and spoiled on her birthday (she deserves it).  Between her gift, the hotel, alcohol, activities and meals for her and myself, gas, etc, I spent over $1000 on this weekend. She also booked herself services at the spa which I paid for as I wanted to spoil her and not have her pay for that on her birthday.  Now this is not about the money at all, I am in a good place financially and able (and happy) to do this for my best friend!

\- I volunteered to drive everyone (about 1.5 hours away) as I know she hates driving and she ended up telling all her friends I would pick them up (3 different people, all between 20-30minutes out of the way).  Annoying, but whatever, anything for my besties birthday!!  All of her friends offered gas money when we were in the car (which I did not accept) and she didn’t say a word.. 

\-  I made all the calls booking the hotel, her spa treatments, reservations, etc.. as she hates doing that stuff and shouldn’t have to organize her own bday!! I even reached out to her boy friend and helped him plan a surprise for her for the weekend. 

\-  I made everybody little gift boxes (she wanted skin care/spa vibes for the weekend), with head bands, face masks, skin care tools, etc. 

\-  She wanted a few outfit options for the weekend and ordered them together to save on shipping, and although this was done with prior conversation about sharing costs, I never asked her to pay me back (she also didn’t offer after it was paid for). 

\-   I made sure she had coffee, drinks, charcuterie, and breakfast waiting for her every day. Organized a cake, candles, decorations, photography, etc. Every tiny detail I knew she would love. 

\-  There was a girl invited who has excessively bullied me and says disgusting and hurtful things about me (still to this day). (Brief backstory as I swear i’m not the asshole - her and I were good friends in high school (graduated 10 years ago) and 3 years after grad she started dated a guy who I had hooked up with 1 time like 5-6 years prior and hadn’t talked to since.. She decided she hated me and even after them breaking up over 3 years ago due to him being super abusive to her, she still continues to hate me because of him and incessantly bully me and talk shit about me to my best friend and others in the friend group). ANWAYS, mentioning all this to say that my bestie asked how I felt about inviting her to the weekend, and I assured her that I will do whatever it takes to make her happy and put aside any feelings and be kind to this girl for the sake of her birthday.

I truly would do anything to make her happy and I am not going to be the one getting in the way of people showing up for her on her special day, no matter how hard it is. 

Everyone was excited to go for a weekend spa getaway, but I feel like the only one who went out of my way to make her feel special and acknowledge her birthday (as I should as her bestie!!) 

At the end of the weekend, I dropped her off at home and she said “Thanks for everything” and that was it. I didn’t do any of this for any other reason than to make sure she had an amazing birthday and felt loved and special. It wasn’t about the money, recognition, or myself. But am I wrong to be disappointed/upset that was the only acknowledgment I got? She has sent me long heartfelt paragraphs of appreciation after a few hours hang out or a small gesture, but this only got a brief thank you in passing.. I don’t want any big praise, but honestly did think she would have sent me a text after the weekend was over.. 

I feel like by being upset about this I am making it about myself, or that it seems like I only did it to be praised. But I also am sad that she didn’t even acknowledge the effort, thought, and intention (despite the money), that went into making sure she was celebrated. 

I messaged her the next day asking if she had a good weekend and it lived up to her expectations (genuinely wondering and needed best friend debriefing chat). She mentioned how she was so glad one of her hometown friends had a good time (mom of 2 who doesn’t get out much and didn’t know the rest of the girls), and how had just got off a call thanking her as she was so grateful for the effort she put in to come… 

I could share my feelings with her and I know we could talk about it (wouldn’t be a big fight or anything).. but I don’t want to bring it up and make her feel bad or make it seem like I am fishing for appreciation, and any acknowledgment just wouldn’t feel genuine if it was because I mentioned it.  but I am really hurt by the whole situation.. I have been trying to act as if all is good but I feel like this is starting to build resentment towards her.. 

I need your honest opinions (please be nice I am already fragile) on if you think I am over reacting/being too sensitive or making this about myself… Also would love opinions on what you would do in this situation.. Do you tell her your honest thoughts or keep it between yourself and random strangers on a reddit page? 😂

It was just a normal motion notification from my front camera while I was inside making coffee.

“Person detected.”

That was weird, but not alarming.

I live on a quiet street. People walk past sometimes.

I opened the live feed.

My driveway was empty.

No person.

No car.

No movement.

Just my empty driveway and the edge of the road.

I assumed it was a bug or maybe a shadow triggering the detection.

But when I checked the playback…

The alert was still marked as “Person detected.”

And the footage?

Showed absolutely nothing.

Not even a flicker.

Just me walking into frame ten minutes later to take the garbage out.

I brushed it off.

Until it happened again.

And again.

And again.

Every single day.

Always the same location.

The very end of my driveway.

After the fourth alert, curiosity got the better of me.

So instead of checking the camera first, I walked to the window and looked outside.

That’s when I saw him.

A man standing at the end of my driveway.

Not moving.

Not on the sidewalk.

Not in the street.

Just standing exactly where the motion detection box always appeared on my camera app.

He was facing my house.

I couldn’t see his face clearly from the distance, but I could tell one thing immediately.

He wasn’t using a phone.

Wasn’t looking around.

Wasn’t shifting his weight.

He was just standing there.

Like he had been there for a long time.

I grabbed my phone and opened the live camera feed while still looking out the window.

The driveway on the camera was empty.

I slowly looked back outside.

He was still there.

Standing in the exact same spot.

I’m planning my first trip to Huatulco and would love some advice. I’ll be traveling solo (female, late 40s) and am looking for somewhere safe, walkable, and relaxing. Spanish is my first language, so navigating locally isn’t an issue.

I’m not into party scenes — I’m more interested in:

* beautiful swimmable beaches
* morning coffee walks
* great local food
* yoga or light hiking
* peaceful, low-key vibes

I’m trying to decide between staying in **La Crucecita**, **Santa Cruz**, or closer to one of the bays like Tangolunda. I’d love to be somewhere I can walk to restaurants and feel comfortable going out alone in the evenings without needing a car.

For those who’ve been:

* Which area feels safest and most convenient?
* Is it better to stay in town or directly on a bay?
* Any boutique hotels or smaller stays you’d recommend?
* Are there areas that feel too isolated for a solo traveler?

Would especially love to hear from other solo women who’ve visited.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I wanted to quickly share my experience choosing a water filter here in New Zealand.

Our tap water is safe, but I started noticing a slight chlorine taste and some scaling in the kettle. It wasn’t a huge issue, but enough to make me look into filtration options.

**After researching, I learned:**

* Carbon filters help with taste and chlorine.
* Sediment filters are good if you have particles or older pipes.
* Reverse osmosis is powerful but not always necessary.

I decided to install an under-sink system from a local NZ company called **Mountain Fresh**. It wasn’t about promotion — I just preferred a supplier that understands local water conditions.

**Since installing it:**

* The chlorine taste is gone.
* Tea and coffee taste better.
* Less buildup in the kettle.

If you’re considering a water filter in NZ, I’d suggest understanding your water source first and choosing a system that actually matches your needs.

Looking for a Co-Pilot in Life","I’m 27, based in Bombay, currently working at a consulting company. Life’s stable, work’s good, things are moving… but I’ve realised I genuinely miss having someone to share my time with. I’m looking for friendship first - something comfortable, intentional, and if it naturally grows into more, I’m open to that.

I’m an ambivert. With the right person, I can talk for hours. In the wrong room, I’ll quietly observe and disappear into my thoughts. I’ve explored Mumbai more than I can count (mostly on my bike), but I spend most weekends in Navi Mumbai now - calmer, quieter, easier to breathe.

I love cooking. A lot. Baking too. I’ve actually run my own bakery in the past, so yes, I take food seriously. Cooking for people makes me happy in a very real way. If I like you, you will be fed.

I’m also into coffee (borderline obsessive), motorcycles, gaming, plants (my little green children), and constantly exploring new business ideas just because I enjoy building things. I’m a photographer, an audiophile, and I run a lame jokes page - so expect random chaos mixed with deep thoughts.

Emotionally, I’m curious, slightly talkative, definitely an overthinker, and occasionally chaotic in a harmless way. My friends describe me as “jack-of-all-trades, master of none… but better than a master of one.” I’ll take that.

I enjoy deep conversations, comfortable silences, shared playlists, long rides, cooking together, or just spending time without it feeling forced. I’m not looking for instant intensity. I’d rather build something steady, honest, and meaningful.

If you’re kind, emotionally aware, have your own thing going on, and are open to starting as friends and seeing where it goes - we’ll probably get along.

1r8p0av,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1r8p0av/aitah_gf_gets_mad_easily_from_everything_i_do/,"AITAH, GF GETS MAD EASILY FROM EVERYTHING I DO","Girlfriend (F22) and I (M22) keep escalating small issues into huge conflicts — is this resentment or are we just incompatible?

I’m honestly exhausted and need outside perspective.

My girlfriend and I have been together for a little over a year. We’ve had ups and downs but nothing that felt unfixable. Recently though, small things are turning into massive emotional situations and I don’t know if this is resentment building or if we’re just not aligned anymore.

A few days ago she caught me in a small lie (I ate something she had previously asked me not to eat and I hid it instead of just owning it). I know that sounds stupid — it was stupid. I apologized, but she compared it to cheating and said it broke her trust. That shocked me because I never saw it on that level.

Since then, things have been strange.

One day she’s warmer — bought me coffee, we went to class together, vibes felt okay. Then suddenly at the grocery store she says we should start shopping separately and that I should basically move back to my own place because we “don’t live the same lifestyle.” For context, I’ve been paying for groceries for both of us for the past few weeks. So that shift felt abrupt and honestly hurt.

She also said I’m not committed to her lifestyle and that I don’t enjoy her food (which isn’t true). It felt like she was rewriting the narrative of our relationship.

Later that night she wanted to watch a movie together. My friends were at our student accommodation and asked me to play FIFA. I told her I’d go for 5 minutes. I ended up being gone for about 30. She got really upset and said it was disrespectful because she was waiting to spend time with me.

And honestly… she’s not wrong. I said 5 minutes and didn’t stick to it. I just didn’t think it would escalate that much.

Now she’s clearly built up resentment. She’ll say things like she doesn’t want to destroy what we had, but when I try to respond she says “don’t.” She oscillates between closeness and distance.

I feel like:

	•	I’m trying.

	•	I mess up small things.

	•	She reacts big.

	•	I panic.

	•	Then I make it worse.

I genuinely don’t want to break up. But I don’t know if this is normal relationship conflict under stress or if we’re in the early stages of something deteriorating.

Should I move out from living with her all the time or not, because honestly I know I am anxiously attached and I know distance can make us fall out of love, idk what to do honestly, I just want to be the best man possible for her but she always picks on the most smallest things and forget the ones I mentioned like small things of human error she really makes a big deal and gives me no room for mistakes and holds it against me and withdraws her warmth attention and affection until she decides that it’s right, idk this isn’t healthy and I keep thinking I am the problem.

Is this resentment? Trust damage? Emotional exhaustion? Or are we just incompatible in expectations?

I’m open to criticism. I just need perspective because right now I’m too in my head to see clearly.",1,1771473526.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

I know I’m going to have red orange leftover, as my natural hair is basically black but i have like 50% gray in the front part of my head. 

Can I reduce the red/orange tones by using a blue semi permanent dye? Or would it just end up straight up blue/purple? What if i dilute it with some conditioner? 

Or would just a purple conditioner work?

I don’t necessarily want to go much lighter, I just want to get the permanent black box dye out so I can start coloring with a Demi permanent medium brown around level 7-8 so i dont get that harsh root line. I will be happy with some sort of chocolate-coffee type of brown so I don’t mind of some red still stays. 

I am a but confused/overwhelmed with the toners that are on the market. And the semi permanent would eventually wash out so it feels like less of a risk.

1r8ozls,https://www.reddit.com/r/OptimalFrequency/comments/1r8ozls/i_saw_something_the_other_morning_something_dark/,I saw something the other morning... something dark.,"Well, I just feel like I should post this here.

Firstly, some strange things have been happening at the house, before and after the Lizzie Borden videos. I'm not sure if it’s connected to that darkness, something to do with my current renovations, or just that time — a time to receive messages.

When I started my channel, it was because strange things were going on in my house — strange electrical phenomena and other events. I knew the spirits had a message for me.

And now, seven years later, after 560 videos and experiments, I am feeling the same thing. They have another message/path for me. Spoiler — no, I don't know what it is.

Here are a few of the strange things going on here:

1. I felt a darkness/negativity after the Lizzie Borden videos. Nothing too bad, just a hint of “hey, we can affect you.” (Tractor not running right, etc.)
2. Here is a message I shared with two people on Discord on Feb 6th:

I feel something is happening and they're trying to tell me something (the spirits). I don't know what. Just typing here in case you're interested… As I got out of bed right now — I had come downstairs at 2 a.m. (when I woke up) and I had to pee (like an old man in the middle of the night), and the stove was down to a few tiny coals so I put wood in. Then I went back to bed… knew I wouldn't sleep again.

I get up, Robin gets up to pee (like an old woman)… I get to the bottom of the stairs and realize my Fitbit is on the dresser where I left it. I rarely take it off as I like to keep tabs on my daily steps — even a trip to the bathroom is an unlogged 30 steps — can't have that!

I return to the dresser and feel around with my hand where I think the Fitbit is. Nothing. My hand never brushes it or my clothes where I had piled them (as I do every night when getting into bed). I turn to go put the light on (because Robin wasn’t in bed). As I turned and faced the door where the light switch is, I took one step and heard my Fitbit hit the floor behind me.

Something pushed it off the dresser. I know my hand never touched it, and my back was to it when it fell. As I think about it, I can't say “Someone” pushed it off — and “something” feels more adequate (using my 6th-sense abilities — the probe). That feels more worrisome to me. I hope it was “Someone”…

3. I have these stairs I built during my basement reno. I didn’t build them correctly, and when I moved the heavy fridge down here to accommodate the renovation on the main floor, the whole staircase shifted downward and became slightly loose. So now when you walk on them they creak. Three stairs in a row make a KRIK CREAK CRACK as you come down them.

Well, a week ago Robin and I were down here hanging out (as it is the only space we have since the house is being renovated), and we both clearly heard someone walk down those steps — KRIK CREAK CRACK — five feet from us. I looked at her. She looked at me. I hesitantly asked, “Did you hear that?” She nodded.

It happened to me again the next morning as I made coffee within three feet of the steps, my back to the stairs. Let me tell you — I know what I heard. Yet the dogs never barked or seemed put off.

4. I was falling asleep in my chair (again, right at the bottom of those steps, within three feet of them). I was sitting down here as the work crews worked upstairs in the late afternoon, maybe three days ago. I was rocking in the chair and almost asleep when the chair stopped. It felt like Penny had gone behind my chair. I opened my eyes, but both dogs were lying at my feet. I pushed the chair back again and it went freely. There was nothing behind me to stop me rocking.

5. This is the weirdest and most bothersome of them all. But I must acknowledge a psychic ability here and tell you what I feel I encountered. I can't explain it, but I know what I felt and the truth of it.

This is what happened two days ago:

I let the dogs out at 6 a.m. Usually they pee and come back in within five minutes. Jack came back and Penny did not. I was worried she had run down the road to investigate the neighbors’ chickens or something that would get her in trouble.

After a few minutes, I suited up and headed out with Jack. It was still pitch black, even though the ground is covered in snow — there was no moonlight or starlight. I walked toward my neighbors Murielle and her husband Mike’s. Murielle is my father’s first cousin and they live within 300 yards of my house.

Unfortunately, Michael has dementia and has suffered a couple of strokes in the last few years. I don’t really know how stable he is. When I go outside, even in the depth of winter, I hear him whistling over the hill — he’s in his happy place. It wouldn’t surprise me if he froze to death out there someday, and I won’t go look for him, as part of me knows this isn’t a bad way to go after 80 years.

Murielle, on the other hand, learned within the last two years that she has developed ALS — the most heinous and terrible way to go that I can think of. I haven't spoken to her about it, and I know she wants to keep it private. I was there two years ago on her 75th birthday when she thought she had some kind of throat constriction and could barely speak. Now she can't speak at all and even needs a feeding tube. Both she and Michael are not long for this world.

Back to my journey that morning. As I walked down that cold and dark road calling Penny’s name, I approached Mike and Murielle’s yard light that stays on all night, the light spilling ever so slightly onto the old snow-covered road.

I approached their yard calling Penny’s name and frantically looking for my pup. I saw a black shape move from Murielle’s yard and go across the road into the bush. At first, when I saw the movement, I thought Penny was moving. The black of the shape was at the furthest point I could see with my weak eyesight (and no glasses on).

Within two seconds, I dismissed that thought.

What I had seen was tall — as big as a man — and pitch black. A shadow on top of shadows. It had no fear of me. I know this. It just eased away so as not to be distinguished. I also know (intuitively) this was no living soul. Had it once lived, I cannot say.

Whatever it was, it had been watching Mike and Murielle’s — and I know this. I feel it. What it was waiting and watching for, I am uncertain, but it has to do with their weakness now — this I feel. It had no interest in me and was no danger to me - It was another knowing.

I thought about it all day and told Robin about it the next evening. I even mused to her, “I wonder if I saw Death biding his time outside their house.”

I can't say for certain what it was, but I know it was waiting and watching their plight.

Robin told me she wishes I had never shared the story with her.

I think I might get out the kettle fountain and ask some questions of the spirits about all of these goings-on.

Once I might have been freaked out about alll of this, but no longer. It's all tied into my role I suppose.

1r8ow12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Productivitycafe/comments/1r8ow12/my_brain_was_completely_fried_from_cheap_dopamine/,my brain was completely fried from cheap dopamine and I didn't even realize it (how I fixed it),"25M here. gonna be honest - I had undiagnosed ADHD for years and basically ""self-medicated"" with constant stimulation. porn, video games, junk food, weed, scrolling... basically any activity that gave me a quick hit of dopamine

The problem? My brain got so used to cheap dopamine that I literally couldn't do anything that required effort anymore.

Trying to read a book? Impossible. Studying? Forget it. Even watching a full movie without checking my phone felt physically painful.

I thought I was just lazy or broken or didn't have discipline.

Turns out I'd just completely destroyed my dopamine receptors.

here's what happened (the science part)

I'm a psych student so when I finally looked into this I went deep

Dopamine isn't actually the ""pleasure"" chemical like everyone thinks - it's the ""wanting"" and ""motivation"" chemical

When you do high-dopamine activities (scrolling TikTok, eating junk food, watching porn, playing video games), your brain gets FLOODED with dopamine. Way more than anything in nature would give you.

Do that consistently and your brain adapts by reducing dopamine receptors

Fewer receptors = lower motivation, worse concentration, less mental sharpness, everything feels boring

This is why there are more college dropouts than ever. More people unhappy at work. More depression cases.

Our brains weren't designed for this level of constant stimulation.

And big companies KNOW this. They engineer their apps and foods to hit the exact dopamine sweet spot that keeps you coming back.

the cheap vs hard dopamine framework

This changed how I see everything:

CHEAP DOPAMINE:

	•	Scrolling social media

	•	Netflix binges

	•	Junk food

	•	Porn

	•	Weed/alcohol

	•	Video games (designed to be addictive)

→ Instant hit, no effort required, doesn't build anything

HARD DOPAMINE:

	•	Exercise

	•	Finishing actual work

	•	Learning something difficult

	•	Long-term goals

	•	Creative projects

	•	Getting stuff done

→ Delayed reward, requires effort, builds your life

Here's the thing: ADHD brains (and overstimulated normal brains) will ALWAYS choose cheap over hard.

Like always. It's not a willpower issue - your brain is literally wired to take the path of least resistance to dopamine.

The only solution? Eliminate ALL cheap dopamine sources so your brain is forced to seek the hard stuff.

what I actually did (no magic bullets)

Phase 1: The Elimination (first 2 weeks)

I went nuclear. Like scorched earth policy.

	•	Deleted Instagram, TikTok, Twitter apps (didn't delete accounts, just removed apps from phone)

	•	Bought a lockbox for my phone (the kind without emergency open - once it's in there, it's in there)

	•	Moved my gaming PC to my basement (added enough friction that I stopped gaming)

	•	Threw out all junk food

	•	Completely quit porn (this was the hardest one fr)

Those first two weeks were BRUTAL. I felt anxious, restless, bored out of my mind.

But that boredom? That's not a problem. That boredom is the cure.

When you're bored and have no easy dopamine source, your brain goes ""well I guess we gotta do something"" and suddenly those ""hard"" activities don't seem as hard.

Phase 2: Building replacement habits (weeks 3-8)

Once I'd cleared out the cheap dopamine, I had to fill that time with something

I started stupidly small:

	•	20 minute walks (no headphones, just thinking)

	•	5 minutes of meditation (just sitting there, letting my brain calm down)

	•	Reading for 10 minutes (actually finishing books for the first time in years)

The key was starting SO SMALL I couldn't fail

Because here's what people don't get: you can't go from 0 to 100.

Only an idiot would walk into a gym and immediately try to bench press 300 pounds, right? Same with your brain.

If your focus muscle is completely atrophied from years of scrolling, you can't suddenly expect to study for 4 hours straight.

Start with 5 minutes. Then 10. Then 15. Build the muscle over weeks.

Phase 3: Training focus (ongoing)

This is where it clicked for me:

Focus is supposed to be painful. That pain means it's working.

When you're trying to concentrate and your brain is like ""this is uncomfortable, let's check Reddit"" - that discomfort is the GROWTH.

Like workout pain. People who lift heavy actually enjoy the burn because they know it means they're getting stronger.

Same with focus. The more you practice sitting with that discomfort, the better you get at it.

I started using 30-minute timer sessions:

	•	Set timer for 30 min

	•	Work like an absolute madman on one task

	•	10 min break (no screens, just walk around or stretch)

	•	Repeat

After 4-6 cycles my brain is cooked but I've gotten more done than I used to in full days.

The timer creates artificial urgency. I'm not just ""working whenever I feel like it"" - I'm on the clock, zero distractions, pressure of the deadline.

It works goddamn wonders every time.

the stuff that actually helped me stick with it

Environmental design

I stopped relying on willpower and just made the right choices automatic:

	•	Phone charges in different room (not next to bed)

	•	Two separate browsers: Safari for work, Chrome for entertainment (my subconscious knows when I open Safari it's work time)

	•	Only keep healthy food in the house (can't eat junk if it's not there)

	•	Cold Turkey app to block distracting sites 10am-midnight (can't override it)

Never work where you relax, never relax where you work

This might be the most important thing I learned

I ONLY work at coffee shops or the library now. Never at home.

Something about the physical separation tells my brain ""this is focus mode"" and I can actually get into deep work

When I'm home, I can fully relax because I don't associate it with work stress

The ""never miss twice"" rule

I still have bad days. Days where I scroll for hours or eat like shit or skip my walk

That's fine. Life happens.

But I NEVER let it become two days in a row.

One bad day is a blip. Two bad days is the start of a pattern.

50% effort is infinitely better than 0% effort.

Fasting for focus

This one sounds weird but I'm way more productive on an empty stomach

I do my best work before lunch. Once I eat a big meal, especially carb-heavy, my brain is basically done for the day.

Intermittent fasting during my first 8 productive hours, then eating after the hard work is done.

where I'm at now (6 months later)

Not gonna lie, it's not perfect. I still have ADHD, I still struggle with focus sometimes.

But compared to where I was?

	•	I can actually read books now (finished 15 in the last 6 months)

	•	My grades went from Cs and Ds to mostly As and Bs

	•	I have energy for the first time in years

	•	Lost 20 pounds without really trying (just stopped eating junk while scrolling)

	•	Started a side project that's actually making money

	•	Got into my first real relationship (turns out being able to have a conversation without checking your phone helps lol)

The biggest change isn't even the external stuff though

It's that I trust myself again.

When I say ""I'm gonna do this,"" I actually believe myself now. Because I've proven to myself over and over that I can keep promises to myself.

That self-trust is worth more than any productivity hack.

One thing that genuinely helped was tracking my focus sessions and streaks with this habit app - something about seeing ""47-day streak"" on my morning walk habit makes me not want to break it. Stupid simple but our brains like seeing progress.

if you're in the same boat I was

First: check if you might have ADHD. Seriously. Get tested.

Knowledge that your brain is actually different (not broken, just different) helps you find solutions that work for you specifically.

Second: your ""addictive personality"" is actually a blessing if you redirect it

We're very good at getting obsessed with things. The problem is when those things are porn, video games, and social media.

But you can get equally addicted to good things. I'm now lowkey addicted to my morning walks, to reading, to finishing work sprints.

Same brain wiring, better targets.

Third: elimination works better than moderation for some people

If you have ADHD or terrible impulse control (like me), ""just use social media in moderation"" doesn't work.

It's like telling an alcoholic ""just have one drink."" Our brains don't work like that.

Complete elimination is actually easier because there's no decision to make.

This got way longer than I meant it to lol but if even one person reads this and realizes their brain isn't broken, it's just overstimulated, and that can be fixed - worth it

You're not lazy. You're not weak. Your brain is just running on shit fuel.

Switch to premium and see what happens.

TL;DR: Years of cheap dopamine (porn, games, scrolling, junk food) destroyed my ability to focus or feel motivated. Learned about dopamine regulation, went nuclear on eliminating all cheap dopamine sources, started absurdly small with hard dopamine activities, trained focus like a muscle using timers. 6 months later can actually read, focus, and trust myself again. Cheap dopamine = instant but hollow. Hard dopamine = delayed but builds your life.",3,1771473176.0,Productivitycafe,2,1.0,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1r8ovqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/solopassions/comments/1r8ovqt/finally_did_the_solo_europe_trip_i_always_dreamed/,Finally did the solo Europe trip I always dreamed of: (It was WAY more affordable than I expected) 🌍,"Okay, so for years, my dream of doing a solo Europe trip was stuck in the ""someday when I win the lottery"" pile. I just *assumed* it would cost an arm and a leg, especially traveling alone. The common myth I bought into was that solo travel meant paying double for everything or constantly feeling like you were missing out on group deals.

Well, I finally bit the bullet, and honestly? The biggest surprise wasn't how much I loved it (I knew I would), but how ridiculously affordable it turned out to be. Seriously, I spent way less than I do on some domestic trips, and I didn't feel like I was pinching pennies the whole time. It was way more liberating than I ever imagined.

Here’s a rough breakdown for my **17-day trip** through Central Europe:

*   **Destinations:** I focused on cities known for being budget-friendly but still packed with history and charm:
    *   **Prague, Czech Republic:** ~5 days
    *   **Vienna, Austria:** ~4 days (a bit pricier, but manageable for a shorter, focused visit)
    *   **Budapest, Hungary:** ~6 days
*   **My Actual Breakdown (total for 17 days):**
    *   **Round-trip flight (US East Coast to Prague, return from Budapest):** ~**$780**. *Booked about 3 months out, used a flight tracker for deals and was flexible with dates.*
    *   **Accommodation (mixture of hostels and a few budget guesthouses):** ~**$520**. *Averaged about $30/night. Mostly well-rated 4-6 bed dorms, but super clean and social. Even splurged on a private room for one night.*
    *   **Inter-city Travel (trains between Prague-Vienna, Vienna-Budapest):** ~**$120**. *Booked directly with national rail services a few weeks in advance for better rates.*
    *   **Food & Drink:** ~**$650**. *This was a mix: cooking some meals at hostels, hitting local bakeries for breakfast, plenty of delicious street food (hello, Prague trdelník!), and enjoying affordable local restaurants for dinner.*
    *   **Local Transportation (metro/tram passes within cities):** ~**$45**. *Walked a ton, but day passes were clutch for longer distances.*
    *   **Activities & Sightseeing:** ~**$280**. *Mostly free walking tours (tipped well!), a few key museums (e.g., Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna, some thermal baths in Budapest), and just exploring neighborhoods.*
    *   **Miscellaneous/Buffer:** ~**$100**. *For souvenirs, a few extra coffees, and any small unexpected needs.*

**Grand Total for 17 days: Just under $2,500.**

**Real Talk and Lessons Learned:**

Yeah, there were moments. Like that one time my phone died when I was definitely lost in a maze of Prague alleys, or when I accidentally ordered enough food for three people because of a language mix-up (delicious, but embarrassing!). Loneliness crept in for an hour or two once or twice, usually right after leaving a really social hostel.

But then there were the total gems: a random jazz club in Prague I stumbled into late one night, the spontaneous decision to hike up Gellért Hill at sunrise in Budapest for a view that took my breath away, or the incredible generosity of a local who went out of their way to help me navigate a bus system when I was truly stumped.

The biggest lesson? I learned how incredibly resourceful and capable I am when pushed out of my comfort zone. It taught me to trust my gut, to roll with the punches, and how much more I appreciate the little things. And packing light? Game changer for hopping between cities. This trip wasn't about lavish spending; it was about genuine experiences and discovering what I was capable of.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1r8oojk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1r8oojk/my_first_relationship/,My first relationship,"I just went through my first breakup at the ripe age of 25. I don’t even know where to start, honestly—so I’ll start where I think the beginning is. At 23, I was 6 feet tall and 278 pounds. I decided to go back to school, lose weight, and better myself in every way I could. I developed solid study routines and worked out consistently. For the first time in my life, I felt confident. And not to sound egotistical—because trust me, I’m not (we’ll get to that later)—but I’m not a bad-looking guy. Fast forward to summer 2025. I’m 25, in the best shape of my life. I’m studying harder than ever and feel mentally sharp. I meet this girl on Hinge. Keep in mind, at this point I had never even kissed a girl, let alone gone on a real date. I had always been afraid. I struggle with pure OCD, and I used to believe that if I ever got intimate with someone, something terrible would happen to me. So I avoided it. But there I was, standing outside a barcade with the most nervous smile on my face. I was so innocent. At the time, I thought relationships were like Disney movies. When I eventually asked her out, she was hesitant at first. I could tell she wasn’t sure about me, and honestly, I was nervous too. But somehow, she said yes. I meet this girl, and I’m floored. She’s beautiful. I’m honestly shocked that I’m even on a date with her. I had low self-esteem up until that point. To make a long story short, we start seeing each other. The first date was a museum in the city. It was perfect—museum, “want to grab something to eat?”, walking around, ending with a hug goodbye. The third date was at a bar where her friend’s band was playing. That’s when I had my first kiss. The fourth date was at her apartment. You can guess the rest. Up until then, everything felt like a movie. After we slept together, I remember apologizing for how “bad” I thought I was. Wrong move, I know—but I was insecure. Now here’s where things start to shift. On our fifth date, we went clubbing with her friends—two guy friends and one of their girlfriends. We get to the bar, and she immediately runs to it and starts talking to some random guy. He brushes her hair and buys her a drink—while I’m standing right there. She hands me the drink, and we walk upstairs. I’ll never forget how that felt. We weren’t official, sure—but I had been taking her on thoughtful dates and trying to treat her well. It felt disrespectful. Like a pit opened in my stomach. Later that night, she ran out into the street without her phone. Her keys were around my neck. I also found out she got someone’s number that night. The next day, her friend texted her saying she treated me terribly. I told her that while we weren’t official, if I was going out with her, I wanted to be the one buying her drinks. She agreed and gave a half-hearted apology. After that, nothing was the same. She became hot and cold. One moment she was happy and affectionate; the next, she’d look at me like I disgusted her. Not in my head—literally disgusted. Other days she’d be energetic, always wanting to do something, like she was trying to fill a void. And then there was something subtler—but more destabilizing. She would often say, “I thought you said this,” when I knew I hadn’t. Or she would repeat something back to me in a completely different way than I meant it. I’d find myself defending words I never said or explaining basic statements over and over again. It got to the point where I started questioning my own memory. Every conversation felt like it required clarification. Every opinion needed a footnote. It was exhausting. She also had a habit of saying things at the worst possible times. Right before a movie started, she once looked at me and said, “I swear you remind me of a friend.” No context. No explanation. Just something that subtly knocked the wind out of me. Instead of enjoying the moment, I’d sit there wondering what that meant. That same pattern showed up with timing in bigger moments. On the drive to Connecticut for Halloween, completely out of nowhere, she said she didn’t know if we were compatible. She said she didn’t feel “driven” toward me. She told me she likes to feel obsessed in relationships. We were literally on our way to spend the weekend together, and suddenly I was sitting in the passenger seat questioning everything. A month later, she brings up going to get ice cream with a guy she met on Valorant—except she had mentioned this plan months earlier. She told me this an hour before a major math exam, knowing exactly how nervous I was. The timing felt almost surgical—like she intentionally picked a vulnerable moment to destabilize me. I was rattled. I failed it. I’m not blaming her for the grade—but I can’t ignore how unsettled I felt. Moments that should have been neutral or focused became arenas of emotional manipulation. And throughout the relationship, she constantly made demands. “I want a boyfriend like this, or like that,” she’d say, and I started to realize it felt completely one-sided. My needs, my efforts, my feelings—none of it seemed to matter. I would give, try to support, and meet her halfway, but she never seemed willing to do the same. She wanted a man who was proactive, decisive, confident—but she herself was extremely indecisive. I felt like I was being asked to be perfect while she imposed no standards on herself. It created this constant imbalance, a pressure cooker of expectations with no reciprocation. I tried to show up for her in ways she never did for me. I wrote her notes, sent encouraging texts, wished her good luck on interviews for her new job. I stayed attentive, thoughtful, and consistent. Meanwhile, I never got anything similar in return—not even before my big exams, when I really could’ve used support or encouragement. The effort was all mine. She still had relics of her exes all over her apartment—paintings, gifts, bags of clothes. She admitted she’d “never really been single” and moved quickly from relationship to relationship. That fast-moving nature was obvious: I met her mom really early—within the first few weeks—and her friends almost immediately, within the first five weeks. It was intense, and at the time, it felt overwhelming. Here are some things she said to me: “Do you think you’re a cuck?” “How could you be an engineer? You can’t even pass Calc 2.” “It’s not six inches. Trust me, I’ve seen six.” “It could have more girth.” “You deserve better.” “I’ve never not been in a relationship.” “I hooked up with someone a day after breaking up with my ex of 10 months.” “I used him as a therapist for my loneliness.” There’s more, but those stuck. I never felt like she truly showed up for me. For her birthday, I drove two hours to buy her a gift in another state. I brought snacks, cupcakes, decorations—the kind of effort my mom always put in for me growing up. When she opened the gift, she barely reacted. Later I saw her on Reddit looking up something like, “Is my boyfriend bad for not putting in enough effort for my birthday?” At the movies, she asked, “Is this what you had planned?” Then she cried about being ungrateful and said she wished my birthday came first so she could “show me how it’s done.” Days later, she bought me a $200 gift basket—clearly out of guilt. Looking back, the only times she did things for me were when she felt bad about her own behavior. And that birthday wasn’t an isolated incident. There was a pattern. She would often say things weren’t what she expected. When we went to Connecticut for Halloween to stay at her friend’s house, something about it wasn’t right to her. When I suggested taking her to a haunted house during the fall, her friend even commented that it was “different” that I would consider something like that—as if effort itself was unusual. When we went to the shore and it rained one of the days, she focused on the weather instead of the trip. Nothing ever seemed to simply be enough. I remember overhearing her mom on the phone once mention that she’d been given everything growing up—her job was handed to her, her college was paid for, her car was financed through her mom. She wasn’t great with money. At 24 years old, when we went to visit, her mom even handed her a credit card to use. And that’s when something started clicking for me. I had been raised to appreciate effort. If someone showed up for you, if they tried, that mattered. But with her, it felt like effort was expected—baseline. I told her one of my boundaries was that I didn’t like one-on-one hangouts with other guys. People can disagree, but that’s my boundary. Her best friend was a guy she had a brief sexual encounter with before we met. She told me that years ago he had gone down on her once, but within seconds they both felt it was weird and stopped, agreeing to remain strictly platonic. By the time I met her, he was in a committed relationship. Oddly enough, he was the only male friend of hers I actually felt respected by. On the other hand, one of her close friends openly played mind games with me. I could feel it—subtle digs, tone shifts, little tests. Eventually, she admitted she knew that friend played mind games. But nothing changed. Toward the end, she created arguments out of nothing. Once, she got upset because I wouldn’t shave. Another time, at midnight, I went to Taco Bell while she was asleep. When I came back, she woke up and got upset that I hadn’t told her. She started crying, saying my tone reminded her of a toxic ex. Five days later, she suggested a “break.” She admitted she’d compared me to her ex the entire relationship—the same ex she emotionally cheated on and later obsessed over after he dumped her. She said she liked that he mocked her and made her chase his approval. So we broke up. A month later, she asked to get coffee. I went. She told me she’d already met someone else and made out with him—but it didn’t work out. Looking back, I think I was the backup plan. I told her I couldn’t be purely platonic. I can’t go from full intimacy to nothing and pretend it’s normal. A few days later, we slept together again. Now it’s been a few weeks. She texts me with days between replies. I suspect she’s seeing that other guy and keeping me on standby. But I’m done. I’ve started healing. I’ve picked up new hobbies, started walking in the woods, spending time alone. I transferred schools. I’m dieting again. Walking again. Rebuilding again. And this time, it’s not for a relationship. It’s for me.",1,1771472565.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

To make a long story short, I bought a used Profitec Pro 700 from someone I know, which had one known issue:

\- No water came through the group head; however, hot water and steam came through the respective wands, and the pump turns on when the brewing lever is activated.

Notes: The original owner had it plumbed into a home water filtration system and routinely backflushed and performed basic maintenance on the machine.

I did not receive the water reservoir, so I purchased it from Clive Coffee. As I've removed the panels, I now realise the housing for the reservoir, as well as the plumbing, is missing.

I live on a small island in the Caribbean and don't have access to trained technicians or parts, so any help or guidance will be appreciated

Questions:

1. Is it cheaper to plumb in the machine rather than purchase all of the parts to replace the reservoir functionality?
2. What are some possible causes of my group head issues? I haven't been able to test, but I have changed the Safety Valve, replaced the Vacuum breaker, and cleaned the fill probe as that was suggested as routine maintenance from Clive Coffee.
3. Is it possible to replace the PID Controller housing and not the whole PID Controller?

1r8omuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1r8omuz/8_days_postop_reflections/,8 Days Post-Op - Reflections,"**Introduction**:
I should preface this with a word or two about myself so you know how I ended up getting a hemorrhoidectomy in the first place. I am a male, living in Australia so some things may not personally apply to you. I have had IBS (more likely IBS-D) my entire life. I have had an endoscopy and a colonoscopy in the past year to try and find root causes of my stomach problems, but in a sudden realisation while turning 30 I am aware now it’s likely unmanaged stress and anxiety causing my flare-ups. I have had several big lifestyle changes in the last few months, including but not limited to preparing for my first born son. The hemorrhoids specifically were compounded by sudden intolerances to certain foods (including coffee) after getting a stomach bug, and a trip to Japan which my already sensitive digestive system was not prepared for at all. After Japan in September 2025, I had several (two at the time which resulted in three) hemorrhoids which had grown into grade 2-3 in severity. By the time I had my specialist consultation in December, they were needing to be pushed in manually, and were roughly the size of large grapes. While they didn’t particularly hurt or bleed much while exposed, the inconvenience of them pushed me to see a colorectal surgeon. They were impacting my lifestyle, friendships, and work. 

I am now 8 days post-operation, and wanted to share and document the experience for other people to maybe find solace, or at least know they’re not alone.

**Part 1 - The Surgery**: 
I had my surgery in the morning on a Wednesday, requiring two enemas which the nurses applied. This was painful, as it flared the hemorrhoids which I figured was a good thing. I had been told previously by the doctor that knowing the true severity of the hemorrhoids would be difficult until I was under anaesthetic, and I opted in for him to decide whether to band them or lance them, and to just make me aware of the decision he had made once I had awoken.

After waking from the anaesthetic, The doctor told me that yes, they had indeed lanced 3 large hemorrhoids, and I would be spending the night in hospital. The pain was minimal to moderate, roughly the same pain I am feeling now, 8 days later. More uncomfortable than painful.

I was sent off to a private room thankfully, and they gave me tapentadol which I promptly vomited back up. This was also their prescribing painkiller upon leaving the hospital, even after specifically requesting not to have it due to the nausea. This would mean paracetamol and ibuprofen only, as I had no access to the good stuff.

The overnight stay wasn’t bad, mostly uncomfortable. I passed urine easily within a few hours, and spent the night shuffling around trying to stop my shoulders going numb from lying on each side. I was sent home the next morning with no real after-care information, just told to keep up fluids, and watch the low blood pressure I had while in the hospital.

**Part 2 - The Blood**:
Now I’m not one to usually fuss much over blood. I’ve hunted animals, gutted fish, and I like my steaks rare. What I realised very quickly, is I do not like seeing my own blood. The hospital bed and gown both had what I would call significant bleeding, but the doctors and nurses didn’t seem too concerned.

Getting home from the hospital, I was exhausted. The first three days I did hardly anything as I just dealt with the blood after each urination, as well as passing gas and very painful stinging when unintentionally flexing my pelvic floor muscle (sneezing, coughing, dogs trying to jump on me to play). This was very concerning, as again, I had considered this to be quite a lot of blood.

I used (and am still using) menstrual pads in my underwear, and was changing these several times a day. After some professional consultation with my wife, she advised me that it’s probably entirely normal, and said I’d be shocked if I saw just how much blood she passes during her period. This put me at ease, and the lack of any other symptoms of blood loss gradually made me feel better. 

Eight days on, I am now not bleeding much at all, and mostly just dealing with the yellow, clear discharge or pus, which I have been told is normal. The only real blood that remains is very dark blood in my stools.

**Part 3 - Bowel Movements**:
It is the hell that everyone else talks about. It feels like you are attempting to pass mountains, where in fact they are marbles. I was on minimal painkillers due to my stomach issues and doing everything I could to avoid becoming constipated. This included Metamucil, Coloxyl with Senna, and soft foods. The Metamucil and Coloxyl were promptly stopped after day 5, this was due to the hospital medications wearing off and things beginning to move again, and realising that due to my natural IBS, I was in no need of fibre and stool softening medication. In fact, three bowel movements a day for someone fresh out of rectal surgery is what some would call “counter-productive”. 

I cannot recommend Peri bottles full of warm water (or bidet), and sitz baths enough. Use both of these after every bowel movement. Take mild painkillers if you can, and avoid constipation at all costs. I don’t mean in the sense of going too far in the other direction, but it definitely pays to think about your normal day-to-day diet and how you would adjust that before going into surgery. The first bowel movement had me shaking, light-headed, and feeling extremely sick. I realised afterwards that some of these symptoms were due to the amount of blood I saw after flushing myself with the peri bottle, so keep this in mind also if you’re squeamish.

I definitely cried after day five. It felt like due to the pain, the blood, the sitting uncomfortably in my rudimentary sitz bath (which is comprised of a plastic tub on a lawn chair in the shower) and overall hatred of bad hygiene, I wasn’t making any progress. Dealing with the hemorrhoids was far easier than this. Was this all a bad decision? Is this how it’s going to be for the rest of my life? How am I going to go back to work, let alone raise this kid which is due to pop out literally any moment now? Surely there’s a light at the end of all of this.

**Part 4 - A Week Later**:
I’m now officially 8 days post operation. I’m not going to speak in any kind of roundabout way here; it still sucks. The bowel movements are still painful, and there’s still dark blood in my stools. The bright red blood that was soaking the menstrual pads has stopped, and now I’m dealing with a constant, clear, yellowy fluid which smells horrible. I’m still sitting awkwardly on the couch, and my arms and shoulders hurt from laying down on my side so much. I’ve lost weight. I’m not feeling confident about returning back to work and I don’t know how I’m going to deal with this new-born when he comes. Despite all of that, I still feel like I have made significant progress. The pain in the bowel movements is minimal compared to day 4. The bleeding has stopped, and the overall rectal pain is near non-existent when laying down or moving around. I vacuumed the house, had a proper shave, and even moved a load of washing from one room to another without (what I would call) significant bleeding. 

It is getting somewhere, I’m just impatient. I imagine in another week I would have nearly forgotten what coming home from the hospital was like, and why I ever fretted so much to the point of tears in fear of regret. I’m hemorrhoid free, and these are open wounds which are still healing. Those cancelled plans, weekend trips, late attendances all due to hemorrhoids will now not be looming over me as they had been for the last 6 months. I am now significantly more aware of my eating habits and alcohol consumption. I’m also aware that you tense your pelvic floor muscle for things that have no business requiring it, like spitting out toothpaste, yelling at the dogs to stop barking, laughing when your wife and her friends tell you that what you’re experiencing is like a trial version of childbirth. I’m aware that normalcy is returning, just slowly, and it will be worth it. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and know that most of what you’re dealing with is normal. Things like infections, secondary hemorrhages, are extremely rare. This is a significant surgery. You’re going to see blood. It’s going to hurt. You might regret making the decision, but it’ll be worth it, even if it’s *a real pain in the ass*.

4 years old. I really love this one it’s a very good bed. It has two under-bed drawers on one side, and on the other side, it has storage with partitions (unlike the brown bed). The only issue is that the side handles are broken, but they can definitely be replaced.

3. Sofa Set with Coffee Table:
4 years old. The black wooden plank on the armrest is slightly damaged because of my little sister. The right side of the sofa is a bit sunken and has some spots and stains, but it still works well and is a good sofa overall. It can also be split into three parts (a 2-seater, a 1-seater, and a bed-type section). The coffee table is in perfect condition. We are offering both as a combo, but they can be purchased separately if preferred.

4. Wooden Temple:
4 years old. It has storage space underneath. The hinges are fine, just slightly squeaky, but it works.

5. Almirah:
6 years old. It has some stickers on it that were put up by my sister (not sure how to remove them). It has storage space inside and also includes a basic key-lock locker (not a digital one).

Always been the type to handle a hangover, high functioning and all that. Ill show up to work hungover because i did it to myself and trudge along. Beer shots to keep the bad feelings away. I guess i never really thought about it like hurting myself. Alcohol=fun! Right? Me and my friend would homebrew, find it more like a hobby, but i can't wrap my head around it anymore. Might just be me accepting im the alcoholic in the family. If we go out, drinks! Stay home, drinks! Sad, happy, alcohol!

You get those morning anxiety spikes, doom feelings, its ok, this is normal. But the more i think about it, most people feel rested in the morning. They feel like its another day and you dont have to force feed yourself to get by. People just have a coffee and go about life. Meanwhile i have to plan out my day in increments to make sure im functioning. Its kind of a super power, but not one im entirely proud of.

1r8oehy,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1r8oehy/how_to_tell_if_people_feel_uncomfortable_around/,How to Tell If People Feel Uncomfortable Around You: The Science-Based Micro-Signals You're Missing,"Spent way too much time analyzing social dynamics lately (thanks anxiety), but honestly this deep dive made me realize most of us are walking around totally blind to the signals we send. Studied research from social psychologists, body language experts, and FBI interrogators, and honestly just watched a fuckton of interactions to decode this stuff.

Here's what I found: most people have zero clue they're making others uncomfortable. And the worst part? These tiny behaviors compound over time and tank your relationships before you even realize what's happening.

**\*\*The brutal micro-signals you're probably missing:\*\***

1. \*\*The torso turn\*\*. When someone's chest faces away from you while their head stays polite and engaged, that's your first red flag. Evolutionary psychologist Mark Bowden calls this ""the tell"" because we instinctively protect our vital organs from threats. I noticed this at a networking event last month, and it was fucking everywhere once I started looking. Their feet point toward exits. Shoulders angle away. They're having a conversation with you, but their body is screaming, ""I want out.""

**2. \*\*Touched face syndrome\*\***

According to research from Paul Ekman (the guy who literally wrote the book on microexpressions), people touch their face/neck way more around people who make them anxious. It's a self-soothing thing. Rubbing neck, covering mouth, touching nose. If someone does this repeatedly while talking to you, you're probably oversharing, standing too close, or your energy is just... off.

**3. \*\*The fake laugh with dead eyes\*\***

Duchenne smiles (real ones) engage the muscles around the eyes. Fake smiles don't. So when someone laughs at your joke but their eyes look like a shark's, yeah, they're just being polite. Dr. Barbara Wild's research on laughter shows uncomfortable laughter is shorter, higher pitched, and lacks the genuine warmth of real amusement. Brutal but useful info.

**4. \*\*Response time delays\*\***

A fascinating study from Stanford showed people take measurably longer to respond to people they're uncomfortable with. Not because they're thinking, but because they're calculating the ""polite"" response. Genuine conversation flows. Forced conversation has these micro pauses that feel like buffering.

**5. \*\*Object barriers\*\*** 

Phones, bags, crossed arms, and coffee cups held at chest level. Anything they can put between you and them. Read about this in Joe Navarro's ""[What Every Body is Saying](https://www.amazon.com/What-Every-Body-Saying-Speed-Reading/dp/0061438294)"" (ex-FBI guy who interrogated criminals for 25 years, an insanely good read on nonverbal communication, genuinely changed how I see interactions). We create physical barriers when we feel psychologically unsafe.

**\*\*Why this happens (and why it's not entirely your fault):\*\***

Our brains are running on ancient software. The research from neuroscientist Matthew Lieberman shows our social pain centers light up the same way physical pain does. So when someone feels even slightly threatened socially, their nervous system treats it like an actual danger.

Tons of factors play into this beyond your control: their past experiences, attachment style, current stress levels, cultural background, and even blood sugar levels affect how people perceive social interactions. Anxious attachment types will read threat in neutral behaviors. Someone who got burned by an oversharer will be hypervigilant.

**But here's what you CAN control:**

\*\*Practical fixes that actually work:\*\*

**1. \*\*Match their energy level\*\***

This sounds stupidly simple, but most people completely ignore it. If they're talking at a 4, don't respond at an 8. Mirroring research from Chartrand and Bargh shows people feel more comfortable when you subtly match their pace, volume, and energy. Doesn't mean to be fake; just don't bulldoze their vibe.

**2. \*\*The two-second pause rule\*\***

After someone finishes talking, count two seconds before responding. Sounds awkward, but it signals you're actually processing what they said instead of waiting for your turn to talk. Neuroscience shows this activates their brain's reward centers because they feel heard.

**3. \*\*Ask better questions then shut up.\*\*** 

Most people ask questions and then immediately fill the silence or pivot to their own story. Instead try ""what was that like for you?"" or ""how did you handle that?"" then close your mouth and actually listen. Therapist Esther Perel talks about this in her podcast ""Where Should We Begin"" (legitimately the best resource for understanding relational dynamics, binge-worthy as hell).

**4. \*\*Physical space matters way more than you think\*\***

Proxemics research shows Americans need 1.5 to 4 feet of personal space with acquaintances. If you're a close talker, back tf up. Seems obvious, but most people violate this constantly without realizing.

**5. \*\*Reduce self-focus.\*\*** 

Studies show anxious people talk about themselves 43% more than secure people do. Not because they're narcissistic but because anxiety makes you self-focused. Try the 70/30 rule: they talk 70%, you talk 30%. Tracks social reciprocity better.

\*\*Tools that helped me unfuck this:\*\*

The app Finch is weirdly good for building awareness around social patterns. It's a habit-building app with a little bird, but the reflection prompts made me notice my behaviors way more.

For a more structured approach to improving social skills, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450), an AI learning app that pulls from psychology books, research papers, and expert insights to create personalized audio content. You can set specific goals like ""read social cues better as someone with social anxiety,"" and it generates a custom learning plan with podcasts tailored to your exact situation. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples when you want more context. It actually includes content from books like the ones mentioned here plus way more resources on body language and communication patterns.

""The Charisma Myth"" by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks down presence and warmth in super practical ways. She worked with Stanford and Harvard folks, and the exercises are actually useful, not just theory. Includes frameworks for making people feel heard without trying too hard.

""[Radical Candor](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Revised-Kick-Ass-Humanity/dp/1250235375)"" by Kim Scott (former Google exec) taught me how to be direct without being an asshole. The discomfort people feel often comes from sensing you're being inauthentic or holding back. Her approach to honest communication legitimately improved my relationships.

Look, you're going to fuck up. Everyone does. The goal isn't perfection; it's awareness. Once you start seeing these micro behaviors, you can actually adjust in real time instead of wondering why people seem weird around you.

Most people never figure this out. They just keep repeating the same patterns and blaming everyone else. The fact you're reading this means you're already ahead. These are learnable skills, not personality traits you're stuck with.",3,1771471779.0,MindDecoding,0,0.8,False

Everyone says you need a persona. “Meet Sarah, 34, marketing manager, loves coffee and productivity hacks.” That’s fine for ad targeting, I guess. But when it comes to building a real voice, I don’t think personas actually do that much.

What shapes strong content isn’t really who you imagine you’re talking to. It’s who you decide you are.

There’s a big difference there. A persona asks, “How do we talk so they’ll like us?” An authority-based approach asks, “What do we stand for? What do we refuse? How forceful are we allowed to be?”

That second set of questions changes everything.

When you build around personas, your tone shifts constantly. You soften things. You hedge. You adjust depending on who you think is listening. Over time the voice just gets blurry.

When you build around authority, you define your boundaries first. Things like what you assume, what you assert, what you won’t say, when you escalate, when you hold the line. That creates consistency. Not because you’re rigid, but because you actually know your center.

I’ve found that way more useful than inventing “Sarah.”

If you’re curious what I mean by an authority profile, I broke the logic down here so you can actually try it.

It’s not fancy prompting. It’s not some elaborate framework. It’s just a short document that defines how you’re allowed to speak. What you assume. What you assert. What you refuse. How forceful you can be. When you escalate.

Instead of inventing a persona and asking, “How do we talk so Sarah likes this?”, you define your authority and paste that into your LLM as context. That’s it. You can literally insert it where you’d normally describe your persona. No special syntax, nothing complicated.

If you try it and it works, I’d love to hear about it. If it doesn’t work, that feedback is gold too. I’m genuinely curious how this holds up outside my own projects.

Also, I run a few small AI group chat communities where we experiment with ideas like this. We share prompts, break down industry news, compare analysis, do occasional co-working sessions, and sometimes just shoot the breeze about what we’re building. It’s thoughtful, practical, and pretty low-ego.

We had plans for our future. We spent so much time together. We played video games, we cooked together, ate together. The only thing we didn't do is live together. Because we both like our independence. 
He was depressed and I helped him get back on his feet. I was a very supportive person in his life. He told me he wanted to give up, and how important I was in his life. For two years, I really thought that things were fine. 
We both had problems with boundaries. 
He would be the kind of person to ask for space, but the next day reach out. And our life were so intertwined, that if he needed space, I would need to talk to him, it would disturbed him. I got better at respecting it, him, and time with his kids. 
And in 10 days, EVERYTHING changed. So drastically, it felt like a earthquake. 
I had no idea he was on tinder. One night I get on facebook and see that he's in a relationship with a girl. My jaw dropped. 
The night before we were having fun gaming and laughing. And we spent so much time together, I always knew where he was. No idea how and when he's even met her. It was so strange I thought he was pranking me. 
Nope. The next day we had plans to go out. He told me he'd meet her for coffee for the first time and he would come back home around 7. To wait for him at his house. I waited. He came home at 10. Said time with her just flies by and he's happy. 
He told me he told her about me and she hates me. She's jealous of me, our friendship and asked me to get rid of her. She asked that I give him my key back, that we reduce contact. 
That night we had a three hours talk him and me. He said I'm important in his life. Asked that I respect his relationship. I said I would but that if she hurts him, I won't respect her. Told me he felt like keeping two fires alive right now but that I wouldn't go anywhere. 
We said we'd go out the next night instead. He promised. 
Next day comes. He leaves and tells me to wait at home, again. Same shit different day. He goes to see her. I try to put my foot down. Hey buddy, respect your promise. I'm waiting! 
New girl saw it as me being jealous and not respecting his boundaries. He came home and apologized, said we'd go the following day. 
AND THE FOLLOWING DAY CAME! You'll never guess what happened. Yep! He borrowed my car to go to the doctor. He brought her with him, and then ditched our dinner to go somewhere with her with my car. I was livid. I called and texted. He ignored me. 
When he came home, he was upset because I was acting crazy. 
After three days of being ditched and disrespected. He made me feel crazy for being upset. Like his actions were normal. 
After that. He blocked me. And emailed me to tell me the only form of talk we would have again would be emails. 
He wants our business. All of it. For days now we've been trying to talk to each other. But mid talk, he will stop saying he's done for the day. If I need to ask something urgent regarding our business I ""disrespect his boundaries"" and I need to stop because I'm crazy. If I email him too much. Crazy. If I tell him I still care and want to work things out. Crazy! And the way he talks to me, is not like him. Never in his life did he ever said the words boundaries. Or asked me to respect his. 

Ever since I've been trying to discuss important things and he ask me to respect him, he never respect what I want. Never. Like asking to inventory our assets. He will shut me down but then get upset when he sees it's taking too much time. Yea it's taking time because you keep saying no to me going to our office and take pictures. Or at 3 PM he will say he's done talking to me for the day. And the next day it's: Hey it's taking so much time solving this, can you hurry? You're causing problems! 
Like I'm not? I wanted to talk but you told me to F off. 

Like the sudden change of friendship is making me question my own reality. I sent him a heartfelt message last night. And this morning he emailed me saying things like, it was also my decision to stop talking to you. Not just my girlfriend. 
I'm so blindsided. Why say everything was fine if they weren't? Communication has always been so important for me. We would sit down and talk if I felt something was bothering him. 
And for the past ten days, I've been feeling crazy. He's making me feel crazy. Like nothing I've done mattered. All the help, and support. All he said. 
And I've been questioning my own sense of self. What did I do wrong, was I not a good person? And every time I try to have a conversation with him. He shuts me down. Says he doesn't wanna talk about it. We never did. He just blocked me, never explained the whys. It's driving me crazy not to know. I know he used to do that before, where I'd ask and he would say he didn't wanna talk about it when he had no reasons to do something and would do it anyways. 
He was diagnosed with CPTSD a few years ago, following an abusive relationship with a woman. 
Was I abusive to him?

1r8o7ul,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1r8o7ul/lukewarm_take_i_think_personas_are_overrated/,Lukewarm Take - I think personas are overrated.,"I’m starting to think most content advice gets this wrong.

Everyone says you need a persona. “Meet Sarah, 34, marketing manager, loves coffee and productivity hacks.” That’s fine for ad targeting, I guess. But when it comes to building a real voice, I don’t think personas actually do that much.

What shapes strong content isn’t really who you imagine you’re talking to. It’s who you decide you are.

There’s a big difference there. A persona asks, “How do we talk so they’ll like us?” An authority-based approach asks, “What do we stand for? What do we refuse? How forceful are we allowed to be?”

That second set of questions changes everything.

When you build around personas, your tone shifts constantly. You soften things. You hedge. You adjust depending on who you think is listening. Over time the voice just gets blurry.

When you build around authority, you define your boundaries first. Things like what you assume, what you assert, what you won’t say, when you escalate, when you hold the line. That creates consistency. Not because you’re rigid, but because you actually know your center.

I’ve found that way more useful than inventing “Sarah.”

If you’re curious what I mean by an authority profile, I broke the logic down here so you can actually try it.

It’s not fancy prompting. It’s not some elaborate framework. It’s just a short document that defines how you’re allowed to speak. What you assume. What you assert. What you refuse. How forceful you can be. When you escalate.

Instead of inventing a persona and asking, “How do we talk so Sarah likes this?”, you define your authority and paste that into your LLM as context. That’s it. You can literally insert it where you’d normally describe your persona. No special syntax, nothing complicated.

If you try it and it works, I’d love to hear about it. If it doesn’t work, that feedback is gold too. I’m genuinely curious how this holds up outside my own projects.

Also, I run a few small AI group chat communities where we experiment with ideas like this. We share prompts, break down industry news, compare analysis, do occasional co-working sessions, and sometimes just shoot the breeze about what we’re building. It’s thoughtful, practical, and pretty low-ego.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

The War on Drugs is a trillion-dollar fail. The cartels are winning, the streets are dangerous, and the current ""fix"" is just a revolving door of prison cells. What if we stopped fighting the market and just **nationalized** it?

# 1. The Hostile Takeover (Bye-Bye Cartels)

The government starts mass-producing pharmaceutical-grade supply. It’s clean, it’s regulated, and here’s the kicker: it’s **free or dirt cheap.**

* **The Math:** You can’t out-compete ""free."" Within 48 hours, every street dealer and cartel loses their entire customer base. No more ""hot shots,"" no more mystery fentanyl. The black market dies because it simply can't compete with a legal monopoly.

# 2. The ""10% Power Move"" (The Choice)

This isn’t about lying to people. It’s about **Shared Decision Making.** \* When you come in for your supply, the ""dealer"" (a nurse) offers a choice: *""You want the full strength, or do you want to try the 10% drop this week?""*

* **The Psychology:** When people feel safe and fed, they actually start choosing the taper. Studies show that when you give addicts **autonomy** (the power to choose), they are more likely to stick to a recovery plan than when they're forced into it. It’s a slow-motion walk down the ladder, and they hold the railing.

# 3. The ""Universal Cafe"" ☕

We don't put these clinics in sterile hospitals. We put them in the **Neighborhood Cafe.**

* **The Vibe:** A bright, open cafe with free food and coffee for *anyone* who’s hungry—addict, student, or local worker.
* **The Magic:** It kills the stigma. You sit addicts next to regular neighbors. When you're treated like a human and fed a warm meal, you stop living in ""survival mode.""
* **The Funding:** We sell ""Supportive Coffee"" and merch to the public. ""Buy a muffin, fund a recovery."" The neighborhood becomes a stakeholder in the solution.

# 4. The Triple Win 💰

* **Crime:** Drops to near zero. Why rob a pharmacy or a car when your fix is free and your lunch is waiting at the Cafe?
* **Prisons:** We stop spending $70k a year to lock someone up and spend $5k a year to keep them stable and fed.
* **Property Value:** Alleys clear up and parks get safer because the ""scene"" has moved inside to a supervised, clean, social environment.

**The Bottom Line:** We stop treating addiction as a crime to be punished and start treating it as a **market to be dominated** and a **community to be fed.** We de-fund the criminals, stabilize the users, and let them *choose* their way back to a normal life.

**Is it radical? Yes. But is it crazier than what we're doing now? Absolutely not.**

* *""Isn't this just giving free drugs to criminals?""* (Answer: It's cheaper than jail!)
* *""Won't more people start using?""* (Answer: The ""Boring"" effect—it's medicine, not a party.)
* *""How do we pay for it?""* (Answer: Redirecting the massive police/prison budget.)

Spent the last year researching this after watching too many people (myself included) ignore the warning signs until shit got real. Combined insights from therapy, neuroscience podcasts, and way too many 3am anxiety spirals. Here's what I wish someone told me earlier.

Your brain isn't broken. It's overwhelmed. The thing is, our nervous system wasn't built for constant stress, doom scrolling, and pretending everything's fine when it's clearly not. Modern life is basically one long anxiety trigger, and most of us are just white knuckling through it.

## **The signs that actually matter:**

* **You're exhausted but can't sleep.** Your body's screaming for rest but your brain won't shut up. This is your nervous system stuck in fight or flight mode. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk talks about this extensively in his research on trauma and the body. Your system literally can't downregulate anymore.
  * **What helps:** The Insight Timer app has specific sleep meditations for anxious brains. Not the fluffy stuff, actual nervous system regulation techniques. Also, sleep restriction therapy sounds counterintuitive but it retrains your brain to associate bed with actual sleep instead of anxious rumination.


* **You're either eating everything or nothing.** Stress completely hijacks your appetite regulation. Some people stress eat, others can't stomach food. Both are your body's cortisol levels going haywire.
  * **Quick fix:** Keep high protein snacks around. Nuts, protein bars, greek yogurt. When your brain's a mess, at least keep your blood sugar stable. It's not gonna fix everything but it stops the physical spiral.

* **You can't concentrate on anything.** Reading the same paragraph five times? Brain fog isn't just tiredness, it's cognitive overload. Your prefrontal cortex (the part that handles complex thinking) basically goes offline when you're chronically stressed.
  * **Actually useful:** The book ""The Body Keeps the Score"" by Bessel van der Kolk is probably the most important read on this list. Van der Kolk is a psychiatrist who's spent 40+ years studying trauma and stress. This book explains exactly why your body physically responds to mental stress and gives you actual tools to work with it. Fair warning, it's dense but insanely good. This book will make you question everything you think you know about mental health.

* **You're emotionally numb or crying over random shit.** Either you feel nothing at all or you're sobbing because your coffee order got messed up. Your emotional regulation is completely shot. This happens when your nervous system is so overloaded it just starts randomly misfiring.

* **Physical symptoms with no medical cause.** Headaches, stomach issues, chest tightness, random pain. Your doctor says you're fine but you feel like garbage. That's because 80% of doctor visits are for stress related symptoms. Your body IS reacting to real stress, it's just not a ""medical"" problem in the traditional sense.
  * **Check out:** The podcast ""The Huberman Lab"" by Dr. Andrew Huberman. He's a neuroscientist at Stanford who breaks down the actual science of stress, sleep, and mental health. His episodes on managing stress and anxiety are gold. No fluff, just research backed tools that actually work.

* **You're isolating hard.** Canceling plans, ignoring texts, avoiding people. When you're breaking down, social interaction feels impossible. Your brain sees everything as a threat, including normal human connection.
  * **Try this:** The Finch app is weirdly helpful for this. It's a self care app that gamifies tiny habits. When leaving the house feels impossible, at least you can check in with your digital bird and do one small thing. Sounds dumb but it creates momentum.

* **You're fantasizing about escaping.** Not necessarily suicidal thoughts, but constant daydreams about just disappearing. New city, new identity, just ghosting your entire life. This is your brain's way of saying it needs a massive reset.

## **What actually helps (not the basic self care bullshit):**

**Get your nervous system out of crisis mode.** Everything else is pointless if your body thinks it's being chased by a bear 24/7. Look into polyvagal theory exercises. Sounds complicated but it's basically techniques to tell your nervous system it's safe.

**The ""Getting Past Your Breakup"" book** by Susan J. Elliott isn't just for breakups. It's one of the best guides for processing grief and loss of any kind, including loss of your former self. Elliott's a therapist who breaks down the actual stages of emotional healing and gives concrete daily practices. Super practical, no therapy speak nonsense.

**Therapy, but the right kind.** Regular talk therapy is fine but if you're actually breaking down, look into EMDR or somatic therapy. These work directly with your nervous system instead of just talking about your feelings. Way more effective for acute distress.

There's also BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia alumni that pulls from psychology research, expert interviews, and books like the ones mentioned here. Type in something like ""manage stress and burnout"" or ""understand my nervous system better,"" and it generates personalized audio learning plans with adjustable depth, from quick 10-minute overviews to detailed 40-minute deep dives. The content draws from verified sources in psychology and neuroscience, so it's grounded in actual research rather than generic advice. Choose your preferred voice style and length based on your energy level that day.

**The Ash app** is actually legit for relationship and communication stuff, but their mental health coaching is solid too. Real people who actually get it, not just automated responses.

**Movement that doesn't feel like exercise.** Walking, stretching, literally just shaking your body. Sounds stupid but trapped stress energy needs somewhere to go. You don't need to hit the gym, just move.

Listen, breaking down isn't a moral failure. It's what happens when you've been strong for too long without actual support or rest. Your brain is doing exactly what it's supposed to do when it's overloaded. It's protecting you the only way it knows how.

The fixes aren't sexy. No one gets better from one good cry or a face mask. It's small, boring, consistent actions over weeks and months. But it works.

You're not too far gone. Your brain is plastic, meaning it can literally rewire itself given the right conditions. Even if you feel completely broken right now, that's not permanent. It just means you need to actually address what's happening instead of pushing through.

Start with one thing. Not eight things, ONE thing. Pick the easiest item on this list and do it today. Tomorrow you can worry about tomorrow.

1r8o0vj,https://www.reddit.com/r/valvereplacement/comments/1r8o0vj/motorized_recliner_chair_for_those_who_cant_sleep/,Motorized recliner chair for those who can't sleep on their back,"I was reading a lot in this group before my surgery and was able to find a lot of useful information. Now that I’ve had my OHS and am 14 days post-op, I’d like to share my thoughts on some topics that I found to be very important for my recovery. These may not apply to everyone going through OHS, but if you find yourself similar to me, you might consider them.

I am a 53M and had OHS to replace two valves with mechanical ones. Prior to surgery, I did not have any noticeable symptoms, but tests showed severe regurgitation in both the aortic and mitral valves. I’ve had an active lifestyle my whole life. Last year, I was more into running (about 2 x 4-mile runs per week) and a little bit of weight training to support muscle strength.

My entire life, I never slept on my back, NEVER! I usually fell asleep on my stomach and occasionally rolled onto either side. So I knew this would be a problem post-op. In one of the posts here, I found someone mentioning a motorized recliner chair. I dug a little deeper and purchased one from Amazon: MCombo Large Triple Motor Power Lift Recliner Chair with Massage and Dual Heating, Adjustable Headrest for Tall Elderly People, Fabric 7634 (Coffee, Large).

While in the hospital ICU, lying on the hospital bed hurt my back-specifically a strip about a foot wide in the shoulder blade area. Having someone with you in the ICU is incredibly helpful. My wife was with me during the day and tried to ease the back pain by having me wiggle a little. She would also squeeze her hand between my back and the bed to massage it. That helped a little, but at night, I was on my own, and it was tough.

On day 2 in the ICU, I was allowed to sit in the chair next to my bed - and it was such a relief for my back! As soon as I got in the chair, I fell asleep from the comfort. The next two days in the step-down unit were the same-upper back pain between my shoulder blades when I stayed in bed too long. During the night, I would wake up at least four times and had to get out of bed to ease the pain before lying down again.

Then, two days in a hotel bed with all the pillows—same result. I woke up multiple times and needed 30 minutes sitting in a chair to calm the pain. Once home, the same thing happened. I’d sleep in bed for the first 2.5 hours, then wake up in pain and move into the motorized recliner chair.

Every dollar I spent on that chair was WORTH it. The one I have has three motors, and I can find a comfortable position that lets me sleep through the night. It also has a heating function, which I found very useful. Sometimes my body starts to feel unexplained chills-then I get into the chair, cover myself with a blanket, turn on the heat for five minutes, and I’m back to feeling comfortable.

I would recommend a chair with fabric upholstery rather than faux leather, as it allows body moisture to escape better. Also, a motorized headrest is very useful. Instead of struggling with pillows, you just adjust the head inclination with a button.

So, for those who may find themselves having difficulty sleeping on their back, I highly recommend this or a similar chair.",3,1771470716.0,valvereplacement,0,1.0,False

I notice this with myself and not sure why I do it. I’ll make myself “healthy” or safe meal foods, like an egg, veggies, salad, some chicken or beef for example. If I don’t feel like eating it, I tell myself that you’re not actually hungry, you don’t need food. So I don’t eat anything else because I didn’t eat what I made. It causes me so much confusion and I keep on doing it. It can sometimes be the only thing I make all day and sometimes I can’t even eat whatever I made even if it’s tasty. 

I’m not sure if it correlates to my punishment with anything junk food related or “treat” like, even if it’s healthy like an apple. The fixation in my brain, I need to eat “real food” before I’m allowed to eat anything else drives me off the wall. 

I even keep track of how much milk I put into my coffee because I drink many cups a day, and my brain uses that also, that “I’m not hungry”, I just want it. So I must not need anything else. 

Logical thinking and trying to self rationalize doesn’t work most days. The mental games I seem to have on default in my brain are becoming more frustrating. I don’t even know what I’m really saying, I just more so wanted to vent because I don’t get it. ",2,1771470667.0,EDAnonymous,0,1.0,False

1r8nx4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIContentAutomators/comments/1r8nx4e/lukewarm_take_i_think_personas_are_overrated/,Lukewarm Take - I think personas are overrated.,"I’m starting to think most content advice gets this wrong.

Everyone says you need a persona. “Meet Sarah, 34, marketing manager, loves coffee and productivity hacks.” That’s fine for ad targeting, I guess. But when it comes to building a real voice, I don’t think personas actually do that much.

What shapes strong content isn’t really who you imagine you’re talking to. It’s who you decide you are.

There’s a big difference there. A persona asks, “How do we talk so they’ll like us?” An authority-based approach asks, “What do we stand for? What do we refuse? How forceful are we allowed to be?”

That second set of questions changes everything.

When you build around personas, your tone shifts constantly. You soften things. You hedge. You adjust depending on who you think is listening. Over time the voice just gets blurry.

When you build around authority, you define your boundaries first. Things like what you assume, what you assert, what you won’t say, when you escalate, when you hold the line. That creates consistency. Not because you’re rigid, but because you actually know your center.

I’ve found that way more useful than inventing “Sarah.”

If you’re curious what I mean by an authority profile, I broke the logic down here so you can actually try it.

It’s not fancy prompting. It’s not some elaborate framework. It’s just a short document that defines how you’re allowed to speak. What you assume. What you assert. What you refuse. How forceful you can be. When you escalate.

Instead of inventing a persona and asking, “How do we talk so Sarah likes this?”, you define your authority and paste that into your LLM as context. That’s it. You can literally insert it where you’d normally describe your persona. No special syntax, nothing complicated.

If you try it and it works, I’d love to hear about it. If it doesn’t work, that feedback is gold too. I’m genuinely curious how this holds up outside my own projects.

Also, I run a few small AI group chat communities where we experiment with ideas like this. We share prompts, break down industry news, compare analysis, do occasional co-working sessions, and sometimes just shoot the breeze about what we’re building. It’s thoughtful, practical, and pretty low-ego.

It’s one of those games that looks easy, but starts to challenge you the deeper you get.  Some days you’ll breeze through it and feel like a genius.  Other days you might have to take a break because you’re stuck solving two words..  It’s perfect for logophiles, casual daily word game players, puzzle lovers, or anyone who just wants a quick brain workout with their morning coffee. 

There’s three modes everyday.

Warm-up : 4 easy words and 1 medium difficulty word

Daily: mix of difficulties. Gets harder each day of the week

Hard Mode: mix of SAT level vocab words and touch words you know but don’t see often enough.

I enjoy learning new words, and trying to build a new word from its roots is a great way to do so.

When you build around personas, your tone shifts constantly. You soften things. You hedge. You adjust depending on who you think is listening. Over time the voice just gets blurry.

When you build around authority, you define your boundaries first. Things like what you assume, what you assert, what you won’t say, when you escalate, when you hold the line. That creates consistency. Not because you’re rigid, but because you actually know your center.

I’ve found that way more useful than inventing “Sarah.”

If you’re curious what I mean by an authority profile, I broke the logic down here so you can actually try it.

It’s not fancy prompting. It’s not some elaborate framework. It’s just a short document that defines how you’re allowed to speak. What you assume. What you assert. What you refuse. How forceful you can be. When you escalate.

Instead of inventing a persona and asking, “How do we talk so Sarah likes this?”, you define your authority and paste that into your LLM as context. That’s it. You can literally insert it where you’d normally describe your persona. No special syntax, nothing complicated.

If you try it and it works, I’d love to hear about it. If it doesn’t work, that feedback is gold too. I’m genuinely curious how this holds up outside my own projects.

Also, I run a few small AI group chat communities where we experiment with ideas like this. We share prompts, break down industry news, compare analysis, do occasional co-working sessions, and sometimes just shoot the breeze about what we’re building. It’s thoughtful, practical, and pretty low-ego.

1r8nrmw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r8nrmw,My Arabic materials,"Hi! I’ve been learning Standard Arabic for a year and a half or so and I wanted to share which printed materials I have been using! I am aware that most people like to or need to learn for free, but if you happen to have some extra money in your paycheck, these are well worth it. Specifically for learning to \*read\* Arabic. But the dictionary especially has been helpful to me for being able to recognize common words, due to its ranking vocabulary by frequency. It also gives you an index to sort words by part of speech and all the words included under their specific roots. It also contains a sparse amount of frequent but dialect-specific (not Standard) words and phrases. The only annoyance for a new learner might be that the ‘words by category’ sections do not include dhamma, kasra, and fatha.

The Routledge Essential Arabic Grammar is less money than the Comprehensive, but this one is twice as full of contextual information and usage notes, on how to apply vocabulary as well as grammar details. Somehow it doesn’t feel like there is much filler even though it is dense. Both the Dictionary and Grammar have a long-term reference use for someone just learning Arabic.

The workbook is for a beginner but has helpful and simple exercises if you’re confused by conjugation for agreement and tense.

I’ve been talking to this guy for months. We met online originally, but he’s not a catfish — we hung out in real life once for about an hour, so he’s real, I’ve seen him, talked to him, all of that.

The confusing part is the online connection is intense.

We:

	•	text every day

	•	FaceTime constantly (sometimes long calls)

	•	flirt a LOT

	•	send voice notes, reels, dumb stuff, emotional stuff

	•	he gets anxious if I disappear

	•	he’s freaked out when I’ve ghosted before

	•	he says very couple-coded things

If someone read our chats without context, they’d 100% think we’re dating or at least heading there.

But… he avoids hanging out in real life.

He lives about 20 minutes away. I’ve suggested:

	•	a walk

	•	coffee

	•	sitting somewhere public

	•	literally doing nothing

And every time it’s:

“I’ve been busy”

“Soon”

“I like to take things slow”

“I will, don’t stress”

But it never actually happens.

What messes with my head is:

	•	he’s comfortable being flirty / sexual online

	•	FaceTimes me from bed, shower, etc

	•	emotionally open with me

	•	but real-life presence seems to scare him

I’m not pushing for sex, labels, or commitment. I’ve literally said we don’t need to call this anything. I just want to exist in the same space — sit somewhere, talk, be human.

So I’m stuck wondering:

	•	Is this emotional avoidance?

	•	Is he using me for emotional intimacy without wanting real life?

	•	Is he genuinely into me but scared?

	•	Or am I just a convenience thing?

The intensity is there. The follow-through isn’t. And I don’t know if I should keep hoping, pull back, or accept that this is all it’ll ever be.

1r8ne2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Situationships/comments/1r8ne2c/reflecting_on_exsituationship/,Reflecting on Ex-Situationship,"I (26-F) was in a situationship for 10 months (November 2024 to September 2025) something I had never even heard of until last year. Prior to this, I was in a long-term relationship. I had been with my ex-husband for eight years, and then unfortunately, due to him cheating, we split up in July 2024.

That being said, I was happy to be out of my relationship because it was not serving me. It was a relationship where I wasn’t treated very fairly, and he was very controlling. There’s a lot more to that story, but that’s not the point here.

As an attempt to feel better about myself, I downloaded Tinder very quickly. I went on a bunch of dates just for fun, and at first it was a huge confidence booster. I was going in with no intention of finding somebody, but just to meet people, hang out, and do whatever. Eventually, I met somebody else who was had left a decade long relationship the same time I did & we bonded over our shared losses.

He seemed to love me a lot right off the bat. Now, I recognized that both of us were way too fresh out of long-term relationships to make decisions that would appropriately set us up for success, but I think we both held onto each other very closely, at least at the beginning.I remember having intimate conversations right off the bat where we talked about what went wrong in our previous relationships, and we both really empathized with each other.

Now, I had seen situationships before. In fact, I had been in a small one in October 2024, a one-month situationship with someone I’d hooked up with. That was more of a classic situationship, the kind where you get left on read for three days and question whether they like you all the time. With this new guy, who was freshly out of a 10-year relationship, it didn’t feel like that.

We both kind of knew it was a situationship because neither of us were ready to jump into an official relationship. However, we were 100% exclusive because he couldn’t handle us seeing other people, as he got attached. I had to, so I wasn’t upset by only seeing him. We treated each other like boyfriend and girlfriend.

That Christmas, without even mentioning anything, we both bought each other gifts. He had me meet his parents right off the bat, and I had him meet mine. We spent pretty much every single weekend together and never missed a day texting. We always updated each other on every single moment of our lives. We went to concerts together, he stayed overnight often, and he even told me that he felt like he could be falling in love with me.

About four or five months into the situationship, I realized my feelings for him had developed into love.See, I had only ever been in relationships where I was treated very unfairly. I know now that my ex was actually quite abusive. So for me, this relationship felt like gold. It was everything I never had and always wanted.

But the moment I realized I was falling in love with him, I could feel some pullback. It wasn’t obvious pullback. He’d still text me every day. We’d still hang out every week. But sometimes he wouldn’t want to sleep over anymore. He’d say, “I’m just going to leave at midnight so I can sleep at home.” I thought that was fine. He’s an introverted guy. He just started a new job. He probably wanted good sleep.

We still texted every day, but it seemed less flirty. More dry and just daily updates. My coworkers and friends often said, “Why don’t you just ask him where things are going?”. Looking back, I really should have. But I was so afraid of losing him. I had been through so much pain already, and I couldn’t bear the thought.

Also, as an elementary school teacher, I didn’t want things to end during the school year because I knew it would really upset me and affect my motivation.

However, in the summer I was busy with travel and was headed to Portugal, so I didn’t get the chance to ask. While I was in Portugal, we texted almost every day, he almost seemed more engaged while I was gone.

When I came back, he wanted to see me almost immediately, like 30 minutes after I got off the plane. The next day, I was headed to another trip to Alaska, and he wanted to see me again right before I left and visited my parents house.

While I was in Alaska, he texted a bit less, but I didn’t think much of it. After that, we went to a music festival together. At first, he said no because of cost, but he changed his mind and came. This was an EDM festival, something he had introduced me to. I had never listened to EDM before him.

We spent four days together at an Air BnB.

There were moments where he seemed very into me: dancing together, staying together, acting like we were dating. But there were also moments where I felt like he wanted distance. I felt like a sad puppy following him around even though it probably didn’t look like it, I started feeling like he was cooler than me. Like maybe he wanted someone else.

By August, things felt more distant again. We still texted daily, but something felt off. One day, he came over to bake brownies. While I was in the kitchen, I turned and saw him on his phone. I swear I saw a Tinder notification and my heart dropped.

We had agreed to exclusivity. We weren’t officially dating, but still. I never brought it up.

He later went to Ohio, and for the first time, he didn’t text me for two days. But on his ride home immediately texted me that he wanted to see me.

Then September came, the month of my birthday. He wanted to come to my party I threw which shocked me because he had never met my friends and they would all be there. The next week he asked to take me out for my actual birthday, just the two of us.

Then one week later after my birthday, he came to my house. (What makes this story worse is I just had just gotten a concussion and was recovering.)

He had tears in his eyes and told me he wasn’t ready for a relationship still and that his ex had fucked him up. He said part of him loved me, that he hoped that this was just a break for now and not forever. He said he wasn’t going to date and just wanted to be on his own & we even laughed about how this was fitting the whole “it’s not you it’s me” cliche. He’s like “but I truly get it, if you could see yourself through my eyes, you’d feel like a rockstar”

He said I changed his perspective on how good people could be and he thought I was the nicest person he ever met. He said maybe he’d regret it and said sometimes if you love something, you have to set it free because he said I could do better.

He stayed for two hours explaining everything while I cried. Then we stopped talking. As we were still matched on tinder from back in December 2024, I checked Tinder, his profile was updated and said he was looking for short-term fun. Later, it said he was looking for a long-term relationship. I cried, it completely crushed me. I confronted him and he said he was lonely and had only gone on one coffee date.

In January, this past month, he reached out and wanted to see me to catch up. We hung out, played board games & then to my surprise he kissed me and had sex with me. Afterwards, he said it felt messy and that he felt guilty and anxious.

He talked about the girl he went on a date with an how she had just gotten out of a 9 year relationship, so he ended the date and told her to work on herself before dating.That hurt, because we had both been fresh out of long relationships too, so why didn’t that rule apply to us?

I thought about what he said how if I saw myself through his eyes, I’d feel like a rockstar. But honestly, I feel like if I saw myself through his eyes, I’d hate myself because he didn’t choose me.

It’s been five months since it ended, and it still hurts. I think about him constantly.

Sometimes I see his profile on dating apps, and I wonder what he’s looking for that I didn’t have.

I keep wondering what it was about me that wasn’t enough. He got to treat me like a girlfriend, tell me he was falling for me, let me fall in love, and then he got to walk away.",2,1771468954.0,Situationships,0,1.0,False

1r8nbdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1r8nbdh/he_keeps_drinking_my_drinks_even_he_doesnt_like/,"He keeps drinking my drinks, even he doesn't like them.","It's not *only* drinks, but it's mainly drinks that he does this with and it irritates the *fuck* out of me. The only drink I know he will never touch is coffee. He hates coffee. Any tea, sodas, sparkling water, energy drinks, I practically have to hide if I want them to last. And sometimes hiding it isn't even enough. I drink water majority of the day, but I sip on whatever throughout the day with it. Zero sugar sweet tea, a diet Coke, an energy drink, sparkling water, etc. I'm not a chugger. I nurse drinks throughout the day.

We get groceries together. I *always* ask him, ""What drinks do you want?"" ""Nothing. I don't really want anything."" Liar. Because we get home and immediately, he's grabbing something of mine. I've made it clear that the drinks I'm grabbing are specifically for me. If he wants something... he could get it. But he says he doesn't want anything.

Whenever he grabs a drink, I remind him that he said he didn't want anything. He says he's in the mood for something that isn't water. I'll ask why he didn't get anything when we were at the store. ""Nothing looked good."" He'll drink whatever it is, AND COMPLAIN ABOUT IT. It's too bubbly, not bubbly enough, too sweet, not sweet enough, or he just doesn't like the flavor. Sometimes he even has the nerve to leave have full drinks of mine on the counter because he just... didn't like it like he thought he would. Even though I reminded him that *he's said he doesn't like the drinks I get*.

It's irritating. I remember one time I had this energy drink I absolutely love, right. A citrus Sparkling energy. At the time, it was hard to find too. My grocery store had all the other flavors, but citrus was rarely in stock. I wedged it in between some condiment bottles in the door of the fridge. He has man vision and can't find anything anyway. I told him there was an energy drink in the fridge, do not touch it. I asked if he wanted something. He did, so I got it for him. I put it in the fridge, right in the front, clear as day. No looking for it required.

I woke up that morning to my drink open, in the fridge, and flat. He woke up that morning and cracked it, took a *singular* sip out of it, ""realized he had the wrong drink"", put it back in the fridge, and by the time I got to it, there were zero bubbles. And!!! He took his with him. He had to take our car to work, so I couldn't go back out to get anything else, which he knew. That happened a few years ago and I'm *still* mad about it.

I used to not even be able to let him try any drink I was drinking because he'd practically suck down half of it. Eventually, I fussed at him for so long about it, he stopped doing that. I still feel the need to remind him not to do that.

I just don't get it. I went to the store today and got some sparkling water. It's not sweetened, it's flavored with a few different juice concentrates, but the flavor is very, very, very, very mild. I love it. If I'm not in the mood for water, or caffeine, or something super sweet and strong... sparkling water is perfect.

He does not like sparkling water. It's not sweet and it doesn't have a strong flavor. Tell me why he comes up, grabs on, AFTER I LET HIM TRY MINE and he said he hated it. I told him to grab literally anything else. Anything else. Grab a tea, grab a soda, grab a water.

Nope. He, all of the sudden, wants the sparkling water. He acts like it's a cute quirk, but it is absolutely maddening. I feel like I'm having to resource guard my little fun drinks because he drinks them ALL THE TIME. If I buy more for the both of us? Suddenly, he's not interested. They'll sit in the fridge, untouched. Once we're out and I'm back to buying just for myself... he's pawing at my drinks.",1,1771468743.0,Vent,1,1.0,False
1r8na29,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1r8na29/im_in_love_with_my_best_friend/,I'm in love with my best friend,"I (F) met him (I'll call him M) seven years ago when we were still in school and had study hall together. The only open spot was a spot across from him. Back then, I was already kinda attracted to him because he had long hair - he still does - and that's my type. I also thought he was weird and I like weird. Anyway, we became friends pretty quick once I started talking to him. Eventually, I switched spots with the guy who sat next to M so I could sit there instead. We'd fuck around the whole hour on our chromebooks or just talking to each other about shit, which was usually his business ideas or what was going on in my life. 

He got me through my absolute lowest point (aftermath of when I was SA-ed and put through the ringer by two people) and stayed friends with me even though I was a bit of a social pariah. I suppose he was, too, but he kept to himself enough in school that it didn't matter. I'd lay my head on his shoulder when he'd work on his homework, and I remember it used to annoy me when this chick (G) from one of his classes started coming into our study hall for him. She'd stick sometimes until after the bell rang. He didn't even want anything to do with her, but she liked him and eventually weaseled her way into his life. 

Tbh I didn't have much of a problem with her other than the fact that she outright ignored me, but she used M like he was nothing. Strung him along for two years and got him all wrapped around her finger, having him do her homework and stuff because she would fail if he didn't. G had a boyfriend but would tell M she'd leave him for him, but just never did. Then when M and I would go to the mall, he'd take pictures of things I liked and go back later to buy them for G because she had so much in common with me. It kinda hurt my feelings, but it was what it was. 

It took her breaking her promises idek how many times for M to snap out of it and stop bothering with her. I told him she was emotionally unavailable and just using him, but he had to learn for himself. She was such a dumbass, too. Like nearly failed her grade and never got a job…her boyfriend is a crackhead, and it wouldn't surprise me if she's going down the same path. Took M way too long to see that.

During all this, I had on and off feelings for him. He was just a constant in my life and still is, but I knew he didn't see me like that. He's pretty oblivious to everything and has a track record of going for girls that don't know what they want. I'm just his best friend. 

I'll spare the exact details because I don't want to be dragged by people who don't understand our dynamic, but he's seen me naked. He even says I'm conventionally attractive, we obviously get along well, and logically, it'd make sense for us to be together - he even admits it - but he's just not into me. He says he thinks he's broken because he's only into unachievable goals.

Last year, he finally got his first girlfriend after years of not finding anyone who liked him besides me. I'll call her L because she's a loser. I get I'm biased, but M says it himself, anyway. She was like G in the intellectual department, couldn't wrap her head around anything M has going on (he's got a grindset and focuses almost all of his attention to his business ventures), and had a lot of mental health problems (which G also had). Anyway, I'm gonna preface this by saying that nothing bad has ever happened to L in her life. She lives a cushy life that involves having everything paid for her including an apartment, has never been put through any sort of hell like me, and is pretty coddled from what M told me. 

L was diagnosed autistic and was super self conscious to the point that she was scared to wear certain things or even be kissed because she was scared of being sexualized. She was never assaulted and she's not asexual (both by her own admission to M), so she had no reason to be scared of that sorta thing (other than immaturity ig), but she wouldn't let him cuddle her or make out. They obviously never had sex. She's also not religious or the waiting for marriage type. M doesn't really care about sexual things to my understanding, anyway, but her extreme aversion to anything sexual was a problem because she'd kick him out of her place if he ever got a boner when they'd cuddle or if he touched her back wrong when they'd kiss. 

So, M is a pilot and flew L down to this thing she wanted to go to. Paid for everything. When they got to the hotel room, she wouldn't even sleep next to him or let him cuddle her, barely spoke to him during the trip, and ghosted him when they got back because she didn't understand that she had to actually break up with him. Like, he paid $800 or something (I don't remember) and she didn't even offer to pay him back even though she has a job and money. I get she's autistic, but I know plenty of autistic people who don't pull mental shit like that. She just wasn't ready for a relationship.

Her hobbies and interests mirror mine the same as G’s did, though. Both of them even kinda look like me in terms of silhouette, and we're all very pale. They were basically stupid and extremely mentally ill versions of me, and even M admits it. 

It's just frustrating, you know? M goes to me when he can't go to anyone else, tells me about his dreams of life, helps me with shit no one else can or will, and we talk practically every day. I work at 8:30am and have to get up at 7, and still sometimes we talk until 2 in the morning. He just doesn't like me. I don't get it. He tells me there's nothing wrong with me, but he just doesn't have feelings for me at all and that's why he thinks he's broken. It hurts me because I do love him. I've spent years loving him, and it's only been this past month or so that I've realized I'm _in_ love with him. 

I wish he would see that and realize what he could have. He knows me. Our values and morals align, he implies he'd never make the sort of mistakes guys in my past relationships have…he tells me things he doesn't tell anyone else. Last night, we spent so long in Best Buy rating their appliances and all their poor designs that four employees pulled up chairs or stood around to watch us harp on everything (albeit, we were the only ones there). Afterwards, I had to drive at about 1mph acting like I was driving home regardless of if he was getting out of my car or not because he wouldn't leave. Then when I got home, I was up til 2am again talking to him just as I was the day before. He once drove me back and forth down the interstate - 45 minutes each way - so he could get me this coffee he wanted me to try. Hell, his eyes practically glitter when he looks at me, though I'm probably delusional about that. We just click.

I just don't get it. I have a good job, earned two college degrees, am not touch adverse, and I have goals in life. I'm not a saint nor claiming to be one, either. The point is I'm actually going somewhere. I know he tells me he's the problem and it's not me - says he's just emotionally devoid in general - but it hurts. Love isn't logical and you can't make someone like you, unfortunately. But I love him.",1,1771468643.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1r8n9h3,https://www.reddit.com/r/veganfitness/comments/1r8n9h3/coffee_for_weight_loss/,coffee for weight loss?,"I'm 20 lbs overweight and trying to fix that, but I'm having an immensely difficult time with restricting calories enough to make that actually happen. My hunger drive is out of control and even very reasonable caloric restriction results in many hours of my day spent in a brain fog so thick I can't focus on work. It makes me wish for a GLP-1 or medical appetite suppressant of some kind, but I can't afford one and thus have to consider other options. I also have problems with keeping up any energy during the day as a result of recently diagnosed depression, so going hungry doesn't exactly help in that regard.

I don't drink coffee and never have but for a several-month-long episode ten years ago in college, but I quit because I became too dependent on it for my liking. I'd miss my morning cup one day and end up with a headache so debilitating I was bedbound by afternoon. I do drink black tea throughout the day (and herbal tea at night), and have since I was a teenager, but I'm so used to tea and its caffeine amount is so relatively small that it has little to no apparent effect on my energy.

I know that coffee is an appetite suppressant and that it's also a stimulant, which is making me wonder if I should start drinking it again for both weight loss and energy purposes. At the same time, it's become a small point of pride for me that I don't drink it --- I literally finished an entire MA and PhD without a drop of coffee to help me along --- and I also know that plenty of fat people drink coffee and stay fat regardless, so I'd hate to make it a big part of my life & a drug I'm addicted to only to find that it doesn't help me with my weight loss goal.

1r8n7c8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualPH/comments/1r8n7c8/confucius_went_to_hell/,Confucius went to hell.,"With all the clown show that's been going on thank sa asawa ni Izzy, it's re-opened the conversation about how religion should or should not be used. And it got me looking back at my previous experiences when I was younger.

A thing to know about me is that I ~~got indoctrinated~~ studied at a Christian school for 10 years. Di counted ang pre-K, but if it were, welp. I went into a Christian pre-k too. Plus, my family is your traditional Christian fam who loves their neighbors and paper but couldn't wait to gossip about them behind closed doors while popping popcorns in the mouth. So, being in that kind of environment, you could imagine how I turned out: a pretty religious kid with a trauma that would make my future therapist have a field day. 

Anyway, high school was when we started delving deep into the Bible. We've had Bible studies in elementary (as in, it had an entire curriculum), but it was mostly just interpreting verses, reflections, studying parables, etc. High school was where the real shit took place. We studied the intricacies of salvation (got really surprised na may certain terms and conditions pala to make sure that you have secured a place behind the pearly gates), the origin of sin, how you actually sin, effective ways to cleanse of your sins... fun stuff like that. This was only in freshman year. Once you get to sophomore year, you'd have more interesting topics like sex, homosexuality, abortion, etc. Ta's during exams, there would be essays you had to write using the correct verses as reference. 

  
So in my first year, there was like a rite of passage where you have to be ""born again."" It's an entire process where you truly accept Jesus into your heart and offer your entire life to him. You'd think that in order to do this, you'd just have to sit, close your eyes, pray for your sins, and tell him that you're ready to do his bidding left and right. Well, technically, yes, you could. But according to the pastor, it wouldn't work if you have to understand the whole schtick of sinning and the real terms and conditions of salvation. So, if you want to go to heaven, you gotta pass Sinning and Salvation 101 first and only then could you commune with god to ask him for the favor of saving you from eternal salvation. Luckily for us, we were in a Christian school getting a very Christian education so it was going to be a walk in park. *(Sorry kayo, mga nasa public schools. /s)* 

So we did all that and went into the whole process of being ""born again"" and it was actually a funny memory for me. Well, funny now, pero back then I was terrifed. Kasi, we were told that if you were truly sincere, you would, basically, hear an answer--the holy spirit/ghost--telling you that yes, you were finally saved. The entire class stood up, closed our eyes, and were allowed to say our prayers to win god's favor, and, hopefully, get an answer. (Notice how I'm not capitalizing his name. That's because I'm lazy and also bc I'm an atheist now so I can't care less.) 

So, I did all that and waited. For a sign. A whisper. The wind, perhaps. Bc I've been a good girl my whole life and if I ever did something naught, I'd drop to my knees every night, recite verses, and prayed as if my eternal soul depended on it. But none came. And some of my classmates were already crying. I cracked open my eyes to see them praying with tears streaming down their face and I panicked bc, like, you guys already got a reply?? Beh, ba't ako wala???? 

Then I prayed some more, switching to the local dialect. Baka naman kasi ayaw ni god ng English. Maybe he thought I wasn't being truthful enough for not using the mother tongue. So, in my very conyo mother tongue, I asked him again to accept. I confessed my sins of the day and past ones that I still remembered (including that one time I spat in my grandfather's coffee bc he was pissing me off. I was five). And soon enough, almost everyone was crying, sniffling,  blowing their noses into hankies. And I still got nothing! My anxiety was through the roof. When the warning bell rang, we were told to open our eyes. 

Immediately, I asked my seatmate if may narinig ba siya. When she shook her head, I was relieved, bc at least I wasn't the only one going to hell. ahahahshshshshshs 🤣😭

  
Before class got dismissed, we were asked to write the date on our notebooks as well as some thoughts to remind us kung kelan kami na-born again. Then, we were told to submit the notebooks for checking. I can't really remember what I've written. Probably some shit like being grateful for having been saved and would use my knowledge to spread the gospel or whatever. 

We were given time to ask the pastor some questions as he checked. One by one, my classmates went to the desk. I heard one asking if he still needed to pray every night even after being born again. Pastor told him na everyday praying was unneccessary. Think of it like a request box daw. If you pray every minute of every day, you drop one paper into the request box. And then you do it again the next day. Then the next. Then the next. It would fill up way too fast. Did he think god has all that time to micromanage the welfare of your soul? Dapat at least once a week lang, gano'n. Para raw hindi matabunan ang requests ng iba. *(So, if any of your prayers aren't being answered, your request slip might still be in the bottom of the box.)*

When it was my turn, I was shaking as I submitted my notes, fearing that the holy spirit would whisper into his ear and tell him that I was a fraud. Back then I truly believed that pastors and church leaders were holy men and that they'd always have a way to know a person's most secret thoughts via the holy fucking ghost. So, ayun, I was super scared. The only comfort I had as I watched him mark my notes was that at least, I would have some of my classmates down there with me. 🤣😭

  
It was also at that moment, and Idk what came over me, that I asked the pastor: ""Pa'no po si Confucius?""

  
He looked at me, confused. 

  
Then, I elaborated, ""Kasi, di ba pa, di sila Christian? He never knew about the original sin and salvation. Does this mean po ba that he went to hell?""

""What does the Bible say about salvation?""

And I knew then that the old scholar was burning in hell. 

I thought it was so unfair. It wasn't his fault that he didn't know god. He was just born into a different culture. Is there a way for his soul to be saved?

When I told the pastor my thoughts, 'lam mo anong sinabi?

""That will be your assignment."" 

He told me to write an essay about how to save Confucius' soul from hell with proper Bible verse, of course, as reference. 

Inang 'yon.

Moral of the story: sit down and 'wag magpabida kung ayaw mo ng extra workload. 

'Yun lang naman. Share ko lang. I'm so sorry napahaba ang kwento. But it was a fun anecdote in my youth. Looking back din, it was around this time that I started being agnostic. And then years later, I'd become a full-blown atheist. Ha. Who could've seen this coming.

started around 13, my mom got terminally ill and I started binge eating, she died a few months prior to entering high school and I got bullied pretty bad so my friends from elementary school stopped inviting me.

my dad got a girlfriend and moved in with her family so at 14 I was alone, ate alone every night, spent every weekend alone.

  
i used some unhealthy coping methods, but healthy ones too. after a few years it stopped bothering me and i started to prefer it.

  
i did college online, have never been to a bar/club, never had my first kiss. I live in a basement apartment and work a remote job.

  
ive kinda convinced myself nobody would ever love me, not really sure if its true or not though because I’ve never tried. just seems like since my family didn’t, nobody would choose to? 

  
sometimes at the gym or at coffee shops men will approach me, and I get anxiety and say no everytime.

  
im just realizing though that I have nobody to talk to, or to call for help. 

  
I was having a panic attack the other night, and i wanted someone to talk to so I had to come to Reddit, which feels kind of embarrassing.. alot of people were willing to talk to me which i appreciated but was wishing I had someone there. 

it also made me realize, when my mom died I remember how sad I was to be alone. I fully remember, it was like 2 days after she passed I was sitting in my room eating takeout and thinking I couldn’t let myself be alone forever because I didn’t want to deal with hard things alone.. and if I keep isolating myself I will continue to deal with every hard thing alone. 



like I said, I live in a basement apartment. right now, no one is renting the main floor so I’m all alone and the house is out in the country. 3 nights ago I woke up to a car pulling out of the driveway at 2:30 in the morning… and the driveway is long and covered in trees, no clue what it was and couldn’t even see the colour of the car. still freaked out, and I have nobody to ask to come over or anyone to ask if I can come hang out with them. 

  
i reported it to the non emergency line but not much they can do since the house has no cameras, kind of off topic lol but anyways…

  
its my fault completely, I have had chances to go on dates and make friends but because I was so used to being alone, chose not to. and now after years of isolating myself I don’t even know how to put myself out there

1r8n4tw,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelentlessMen/comments/1r8n4tw/how_to_whiten_your_teeth_naturally_tips_dentists/,**How to whiten your teeth NATURALLY: tips dentists won’t tell you but science will**,"Way too many people bleach their teeth, brush harder, or chase TikTok “hacks” hoping for a whiter smile. But most of these methods do more harm than good. And worse, they ignore what actually causes stains in the first place. Turns out, your teeth are alive, porous, and constantly affected by what you eat, how you breathe, and how healthy your mouth microbiome is.

This post breaks down actual science-backed methods to whiten teeth naturally. Pulled from research by functional dentist Dr. Staci Whitman, neuroscience expert Dr. Andrew Huberman, and medical journals on oral health and nutrition.

Skip the bleach strips. Try these instead:

**1. Oil pulling in the morning (yes, it works)**  
Swishing coconut oil for 5–10 minutes can reduce harmful bacteria like *Streptococcus mutans* linked to plaque and yellowing. A 2016 study in the *Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research* found oil pulling significantly reduced plaque-induced gingivitis and improved breath. Dr. Whitman explains that it helps maintain oral pH, which keeps enamel strong and less prone to staining.

**2. Switch to hydroxyapatite toothpaste**  
Most whitening pastes are abrasive and damage enamel. Hydroxyapatite (HAp) is a natural mineral that rebuilds enamel while gently removing stains. A 2019 comparative study in *Biomaterials Research* showed HAp toothpaste was just as effective as fluoride in remineralizing teeth, without the toxicity concerns. It also makes your teeth feel naturally smoother and shinier over time.

**3. Mouth tape. Seriously.**  
Dr. Huberman talks a lot about this. Breathing through your mouth dries out the gums, increases acidity, and invites bacteria that darken your teeth. Taping your mouth shut at night (with specific mouth tape, not scotch tape) improves nasal breathing and overall oral microbiome health. Healthier mouth bacteria = brighter, less yellow teeth.

**4. Eat foods that scrub from the inside**  
Crunchy raw foods like apples, carrots, and celery help clean teeth’s surface while boosting saliva. Saliva is your mouth’s natural buffer. According to a 2018 review in the *Journal of Oral Biology*, saliva helps neutralize acids, remineralize enamel, and wash away pigment-producing compounds.

**5. Cut acidic drinks or use a straw**  
Coffee, tea, soda, wine—all are acidic and stain. But the problem isn’t just the stain, it’s the enamel erosion. Once enamel thins, yellow dentin underneath shows through. Harvard Health advises using a straw and rinsing with water right after drinking acidic stuff to minimize damage.

**6. Use baking soda—but carefully**  
Dr. Whitman recommends brushing with baking soda once or twice a week max. It’s mildly abrasive and alkaline, which helps polish the teeth and shift the pH. Just don’t overdo it. Gentle circular motions only.

Forget the Instagram filter smile. Start with your biology. Your mouth isn't separate from the rest of your body. Healthy teeth are white teeth.",1,1771468247.0,RelentlessMen,0,1.0,False
1r8n3lh,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1r8n3lh/fwb_with_a_couple/,FWB with a Couple?,"Whats up - I had a great hookup recently with a gorgeous couple (2 men, engaged), and we all agreed it would be fun to do it again some time. I definitely want to see them again but I'm feeling nervous....

For context: Last time I was seeing a couple, we hung out pretty frequently for like, 3 or 4 months, and then they ended up ghosting me out of nowhere. I was really sad about it! We would also hang out just as friends sometimes without hooking up, we'd go on dates either individually or all together. And they even got to know my girlfriend (who is looped in and is nothing but supportive - we are in an open relationship and have been practicing ENM our entire relationship). Anyway, fast forward to 9 months later, they reached back out and apologized and were like ""to be honest, we both really liked you and being with you brought up some complex feelings in our relationship, which was really confusing for us"" etc etc. ""but we'd love to be just friends with you"". I wasn't sure I really wanted to be friends with them after getting ghosted, but I decided I was going to take some time to stay open to the idea and just think it over before I respond. A couple of days later, one of them was like ""can we grab coffee? I want to talk."" And I was like.. okay what's going on. So I did and it turned out they had decided to split after not hearing back from me. OOF. Just kind of a mess!!

Anyway, I am hoping for some advise from anyone who's had good experiences as a third with couples and a reoccurring FWB type thing with them. Have you been able to sustain a friendship with a couple that you like to hook up with? Any sort of red flags/green flags you look out for? We would be only hanging out all 3 of us this time, which I think would be a good idea. And I could genuinely see myself having a friendship with them, but would want to just be mindful to take care of myself so I don't get hurt again. Thoughts? Advise? Happy hear any questions you may have too if it would help with the advise. Thanks so much!",1,1771468157.0,askgaybros,1,1.0,False
1r8n3eb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aruba/comments/1r8n3eb/recommendations_from_our_recent_35week_trip_with/,Recommendations from our recent 3.5-week trip with a toddler,"It’s time to give back to this amazing community — here are the highlights and (anti-)recommendations from our 3.5-week trip in January–February ’26 as a family of two adults with a 15-month-old toddler. This is our second trip to Aruba.

**Toddler activities**

Donkey Sanctuary Aruba — 10/10. Free entrance; a small bucket of animal food is $1. Around 100 friendly donkeys, plus peacocks, chickens, and cats.

Philip’s Animal Garden — 10/10. Entrance is 6 florin pp, including a small bucket of animal food. We saw and fed goats, monkeys, horses, peacocks, a camel, and an ostrich. IMO, a must-visit with toddlers and young children.

Hunga Indoor Playground — 7/10. A decent indoor activity with a toddler on a hot afternoon. Probably not interesting for kids older than 3. One hour of play is 15 florin per child; socks are required for both kids and adults.

We walked a lot with the stroller, but note that Aruba is not so stroller friendly, especially if you are outside hotel area and Oranjestad centrum.

**Beaches**

Most toddler-friendly beach — Surfside Beach (next to the airport).

Shallow entry, sandy, minimal algae. Almost always empty, with huge free parking in front and Surfside Beach Club nearby if you want lunch or a beach bite. Bonus tip: kids can play at the Neptali Henriquez Playground, about 20 meters from the beach.

Worst beach with a toddler — Mangel Halto.

Strong current and a pebbled entrance, though there is lots of shade from the trees.

**Food — Snacks**

El Tio — 10/10. Best arepas we’ve had in a while (and my husband has Colombian/Venezuelan roots). Open early morning until 1 pm, then again from 5:30 pm to 10 pm.

Tia Rosa Snack — 10/10. Very good pastechi, arepas, and patacones. Local prices (e.g., 11 florin for a huge arepa with chicken and cheese). If you’re based in or driving from Savaneta/San Nicolas, highly recommend stopping by.

Primo Tacos & Burritos — 10/10. Loved it — amazing tacos.

Other decent places (good but nothing special):

Niaska Snack, My Time Snack, and Pika’s Corner.

**Food — Restaurants**

(All restaurants we visited had high chairs available.)

Lima Bistro — 10/10. Excellent food — the best we had on this trip. Worth every penny. Reserve well in advance.

Delimar Peruvian Restaurant — 9/10. Very good Peruvian food; ceviche and octopus were top-notch. Affordable and not busy.

Driftwood Restaurant — 9/10. Excellent fresh local fish, good service, but an old-school ambiance.

Quinta del Carmen — 10/10. Beautiful backyard garden, good food, and very kind service. The steak was excellent.

Bugaloe Beach Bar & Grill — 8/10. Fun atmosphere and good cocktails, but a bit tricky with a toddler since it’s on a pier.

Rich’s Arubian Dish — just avoid. Total scam.

Decent but nothing special:

Dushi Bagels & Burgers, Lola Taqueria, That’s Amore Pizza, Santos Coffee, Moomba Beach Bar & Restaurant.

**Supermarkets**

IMO, Ling & Sons Food Market is better than Super Food Plaza. Recommendation: ceviche from their fresh fish section and the salad bar. We could find basic items including diapers and other baby/toddler stuff in both of the supermarkets. Dry cleaning next to ling&sons is good and provides fast service.

**Adult activity**

Snorkeling at Mangel Halto with Aruba Bob Snorkeling — highly recommend. We booked a private tour ($120 pp), and the instructor was amazing. We saw turtles, a shipwreck, a huge barracuda, and many other beautiful fish.

Hope this helps, and wishing you lots of fun in Aruba!",4,1771468142.0,Aruba,8,1.0,False

I’m a current student here, and if I could go back, I’d take Laurier BBA or McMaster in a heartbeat.

The tuition is essentially a ""prestige tax."" You’re paying $18,000+ a year, but unless you’re gunning for the top 1% of investment banking, you’re paying triple for the same marketing or accounting roles that Laurier and Mac students get. The ROI just isn't there for most of us.

The lack of a real co-op is the biggest dealbreaker. Queen's has ""QUIP,"" but it's a 12-16 month trap that delays your graduation and kills your momentum. At Laurier, you get three separate four-month terms to actually test different industries. While we’re begging alumni for ""coffee chats"" just to find a summer internship, Laurier and Mac students are stacking paid, diverse work experience.

Finally, the culture is a total bubble. It’s a four-year popularity contest where your worth is tied to which ""Tier 1"" club you joined in first year. If you aren’t into that hyper-competitive, prep-school vibe, it’s incredibly isolating. McMaster is the opposite—it’s actually collaborative and down-to-earth.

The ""clout"" at Smith isn't worth the debt and the burnout. I’d pick Laurier or Mac over Queen’s any day. It is worth the world class time and connections that you couldn't get anywhere else.",34,1771468010.0,OntarioGrade12s,24,0.9,False

1r8n140,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1r8n140/headhunter_ii/,Headhunter II,"The sorcerer had a funny thought, as he gazed down on all of the neon squalor glow of the Fallen Angel City below him from the rooftops edge.  

The Nazis were right. You are a degenerate species…

It was all of it a swollen pustule sac. A land of green milk and curdled cheese, cockroaches swam in the stew of discharge and mire and laughably called it a metropolitan. A cultural hub. 

A blade of a smile formed amongst a tumult of dark and ageless hair, a wizard's haggard beard. Blasted by sand and sun just like the rest of the white robed man. White robed death. 

Some say he is the mad author of the Necronomicon. He has authored the destruction of countless cities, countless places… before this one. 

Jericho. Troy. Münster. Constantinople. Alexandria. Roanoke. Ikeshima. Rome. 

And many others… great and small. He doesn't care. He only loved to watch as the red hand of Iblis crawled across the blackening surface of all things dying in its embrace, turning the whole of the world into its killing floor. 

But that wasn't all with this place. No. He was sent here not just to burn but to gather intelligence for the order. 

And to contest. 

…

Homicide was scrambling. They had nothing. What commonalities they did find between the victims was interesting… but it only led to more bafflement. More flummoxed minds in the busying police departments all across the city. All bullshit pretension had been dropped, all departments across all counties and neighborhoods were working together on this one, to bring the crazy fucking bastard in. 

But still they had nothing. Except that he liked to chop off heads. And leave them at churches for some fucking reason. 

And one other thing. One oddity that more than a few of the sharper minds amongst the rank and file of criminal investigators found to be interesting. 

But did it mean anything? 

All of them. Every head found belonged to someone with a rap sheet that read more like a tome. Miles long some of em. Each and every one of em had a history. 

Mob hits! that was the popular running theory around the suits and their steaming white paper cups of coffee. 

It wasn't a bad one, most thought. 

Could be. Could be.

…

Azræl leapt from the dark and charged into the man as he was making his way to his car. Slamming him into the driver's door as he tried to open it and catching him by surprise. 

This was the one. This was one of the faces the goat-shape demanded be brought before her feet. 

His hand, clenched tightly round the hilt of his great sword came up and bashed the maggot across the mouth with the metal pommel of the weapon. A crack, and a splurt of hot blood and teeth out the mouth and the maggot went down to his knees, mewling. 

Where he belonged. 

The maggot struggled to speak and beg as the headhunter raised his great blade above his head. Readying to strike. 

“Not at all for you or yourself. Swear to her. Pray to me.” said Azræl as he brought the blade down and cleaved the head free from the rest of the meat. It tumble-jumped with a ropey-cord tail of thick black red that the stump continued to produce and shoot in dark gouts for a moment before the headless body collapsed to the street. 

And then the night was quiet again. All around.  Lights buzzed and mock heaven glowed. 

The peace was relative, conditionary. You could still hear the ghost song of sirens in the distance. Wailing away in flight, in search, in search of anything. 

Azræl picked up the head and said his prayers to the goat-shaped lord of his house and order. He tied it to the belt of his hulking black leather visage to join two others and went on his way. 

The sorcerer watched. The sorcerer was impressed. 

…

He heaved. Spewed. Decorated the sidewalk and gutter in more bile, blood and stomach lining as another sharp stab in his stomach racked his guts and his convulsion threatened to roll over into a seizing tear in his brain. 

Homeless and well past his last leg, Elton prayed for death as his sickened body worsened on the pavement, alone at the bus stop. Underneath the flickering glow of a dying bulb, a failing light. 

It was not death he received but something more spectacular. Elton, Grabby to his friends and scum and fellow urchins of the street, was made audience and thus unwitting chronicler to a chapter in a shadow conflict centuries upon centuries old, perhaps the oldest conflict in all of man's time. Perhaps even older than that. 

Grabby/Elton looked up from his own bloody spew of booze and lining and watched a giant titan walk into view. Destroying his solitude on this witching houred boulevard. 

He knew he must be fucked. The guy looked massive and he looked like Mad Max or the Terminator or someone like that and he looked like he was carrying a huge fucking sword. 

And along his belt were a buncha fuckin heads…

No fucking way. The dying urchin refused it. No fuckin way am I actually seein that fuckin thing. 

But real or not, the giant of myth and flesh and chained leather continued to march up and then past the druggie’s view, crossing to and then down the opposite side of the street. 

But then something made the headhunter stop. 

Elton heard it too. 

A note.  Notes. Music. 

A wind pattern series flurry of intricate and delicate notes whispered and alternate sharp-stab blasted through the nighttime witching air. Filling it. Dominating the scene. 

Azræl tensed cat-like coiled as his hair stood on end. The music was flute-like. Middle Eastern flavored…

Goddamit. No.

The headhunter was filled with dread. 

The music stopped. An ancient voice, bold, cut through the night. 

“How are you, German? Been long time."" 

His stance shifted to battle ready as his blade came up raised. His voice, louder, cut through the night as well to the speaker unseen. But he knew who it was to whom he spoke. 

""What do you want, snake?”

Laughter. Real. The knight Azræl always was good for a laugh as far the sorcerer was concerned.

“So funny?"" Azræl said to the night all around him. “Come out and show me what's so funny, witch."" 

More laughter. 

“Have we not shared many things over the long years, my friend? Such a long time. A great deal.”

A series of images flicker-shot through the headhunter's mind then. Whether put there by the devilry of the sorcerer or memories of his own from one of many possible past lives, Azræl was not sure. If he lived through this encounter he would meditate and pray on the matter later. 

If he lived through this encounter. 

His mind's eye:

The forests and the forest people and their villages are burning. There is much bloodletting. The ground is gorged, it cannot possibly drink up all of it. It sloshes about the ankles of the soldiering and the marching and the frantic frightened running. The pursuers too. The blood that chokes the earth sloshes mire-like about the furnace steps of them all. Charlemagne has demanded these pagan northmen be put to kneel before the cross or be put to the sword. Slavery for their women and children…

… and the knights were thus dispatched thither…

The headhunter severed the line of thought or memory or whatever it was with brutal sudden cunning and roared into the empty silent night.

“Show yourself, mongrel!"" 

His laughter never seemed to cease. It stood in place of a physical person. Almost attaining its own physicality.

“You hurl insults because you've nothing else to throw! Nothing else to attack! You are hilarious, German! I've always liked you but you should not be so easy, not after all this time, no?"" 

He had to be careful. The sorcerer was dangerous. He could bend and weave reality seemingly at will, like a djin. None of his brotherhood nor the high priest could discern his source of power. Nor its limits. 

“I insult you, witch, because you and your kind are garbage."" 

Laughter that became a cacophonous crack! It dominated the world, the soundtrack hell to the neon witching scene. The music somehow came to life and began to play again, a wicked untethered horde flurry series of scaling and wild notes in wild man tandem with the laughter of the sorcerer, a corruption duet.

A ney. The headhunter remembers what it is that the instrument is called. A ney. 

Its sound and the sorcerer's laughter were a whirlwind maelstrom expansion sound swell within his skull. For a moment he considered taking his own blade and driving it into his own face, bashing it in and freeing that which was trapped within and growing, threatening to burst like the milk of green infection.

He stopped himself at the last moment. His training saving him. He recognized what was happening, what it was…

… bewitchment. 

He regained his focus against the tumult wave of sound storm wielded by the sorcerer, who once again cried out from nowhere. 

“Garbage! We are all garbage for the earth, German. We are all meat detritus for the watering jaws of the starving soil, we all return to it, are all reduced to ruin and returned to the sour womb to feed the indifferent planet. You know! You know! Only our petty Gods care! And so they fight! And, we, their moving pieces!”

And with that, the pieces did move. 

 Hand of Iblis. The mad sorcerer. 

Against champion of the goat-shape, Azræl.

And this modern Sodom of steel and human woe was to be the chess board for their latest match. A contest of secret champions. 

He did not see, but felt… 

Behind him. Movement. Killing stance. 

The headhunter whirled round with sudden animal speed in a counter slash. Roaring. 

But he roared… and slashed… at nothing. 

Nothing there. Only thin night air. 

Laughter/voice. Behind him again. 

“The same tricks always work on all of you."" 

He whirled once more. Nothing. 

The laughter again. Across the street. 

Azræl drew throwing dagger and with a lunge and a flick/turn of the forearm and wrist, threw the quivering blade. 

It struck pavement next to a dying drunk in a splatter burst of caveman fire spray. Grabby yelped. But there was no sorcerer of the sands over there. 

Or anywhere. 

Goddamit. 

""Up here.”

The headhunter whirled once more, a dancer upon my stage thought the sorcerer but kept it to himself. The German would not appreciate such an observation. 

""Why do you hide in a tree?” asked the black knight of the goat-shape order impetiously. 

The sorcerer grinned, balanced on the branch of a starving sapling oak. Running alongside a dark and quiet apartment building. 

""I've always appreciated a wider view, German. Always. Up here, I see more and I am closer to heaven and therefore I can see more like God. You… and your brothers… you stay down there in the dirt because you cannot know anything more."" 

Azræl raised blade. 

“Come down here and show me what I know, mongrel. Perhaps I can show you a thing or two as well."" 

The sorcerer shrugged. 

“Eh."" 

Azræl drew once more and threw. The throwing blade of ornate seven pointed star flew unabated, cutting through the nighttime chill like a deadly bird of sharpened stabbing steel. 

But when the piercing blade found the place in the tree where the heart of the sorcerer was, it no longer was there. 

It never had been. 

""I'm always behind you, German.” 

He spun on his booted heels and his great arms carried his tireless steel down in another great chop. But it was already too late. 

The sorcerer raised the ney and blocked the blow as if the wind instrument was an iron bar. He then flew in, swift movement that was not at all human or natural, stepping in close and bringing the long cylindrical body of the instrument down in a cracking blow across the headhunter's crown, splitting it and knocking consciousness from his mind's failing grip. 

But as he sent the headhunter's mind on a journey into darkness, he gave it another vision. A vision of flames. 

…

Jerusalem. 

Burning Jerusalem. 

where will you turn when it all goes wrong…?

The holy city is a cinder shrieking thousands as one. The holy city is in flames. 

… and you're on the run

And all around the city is a newly erected manmade hellscape forest grove. All around the city are the impaling lancing sticks. On them are the impaled. All of them are still screaming, screaming with their burning city. Man. Woman. Child. Animal. The warriors that have done this like to crucify lions for fun but for now, this will suffice. The people of the Lord's precious city will make satisfactory sport. 

And they do. As the forest of the impaled. All of them beg for death, they are the only words left, the only ones they can remember now in the throes of this special agony. Thousands upon thousands of shrieking lanced through but still living souls. Bodies skewered every which way, up through the groin, behind the genitals, upside down and through the tissue of the back, up the ass, gravity pulls savagely as if hungry and they slowly sink lower and lower along the stabbing spire body of the impaling lances as the time drags by with sadistic cruelty. The sheer heart attack torture of the sensations of tearing and rupture and bodily invasion and ruin as all and one horrible coalescence is all that any of them are capable of knowing in their last drawn out hours. For many it is days. 

And beside the forest of the impaled and all of its mindless shrieking, the burning city. 

Jerusalem. 

…

When the headhunter returned from darkness he was lying alone in the street. 

He sat up quickly, Panicked! 

His great sword was still clutched tightly. 

But when he looked around, the drunk that had been watching them was dead now. Blood foamed from his eyes and mouth like a hot porridge stew of thick sudsy pink. 

Worse yet, the sorcerer was gone. 

Worse than that, so were the heads. 

So was his offering…

Goddamit.

Anyhow, I read that the Timex strap was genuine leather, so I soaked the original in a blend of black coffee, soy saucez and a touch of balsamic vinegar (to enhance the red). 

I ended up with a strap that smells like salad dressing, but doesn't look any different. 

This surprised me because it's not a gloss treated strap, and I soaked it overnight. I would have thought that this would stain anything porous, but even the inside of the strap is untouched. 

So, are these straps really leather? Or have they been treated with some kind of plastic coating? ",19,1771467809.0,timex,8,0.95,False

I met her about a year ago. Instant chemistry, sexual tension, all that fun stuff. There was an age gap of 7 years, she's 22 now, but that wasn't the issue between us.

We got close, I asked her out, and she ended up rejecting me with a lie about being taken. I was like, alright, I respect that. I sensed she lied but I didn't chase.

Then in the fall we crossed paths again. Same as before, she tried flirting, I sent a vulnerable text, she replied with an emoji then avoided me like I had the plague. We shared classes; she'd wait until I got close then run out of the class. A couple of times I said hello and she shook in front of the entire class, just seemed completely dysregulated.

So this winter she finally approached me. Told me she was scared and admitted she lied about her boyfriend.

We were talking a few days ago and she told me she was getting therapy for her avoidance. To be honest, I was a bit skeptical, I've never dated someone like what she claims to be before. The issue for me was how a simple coffee ask led to such a shit show that lasted almost a year. When I asked her, we weren't even that close. And back then after I pulled away, she sabotaged my connection with another girl and nearly cost us our group project grade.

Like, before the ask we talked for a couple of months, weren't that close romantically. I just wanted to get to know her and hence the coffee invite, but she treated it like I proposed to her.

And I ask because we are going out on a date soon. Things are kind of escalating fast already, physically, and I want to make sure I'm not missing something before I go all in.

So is she just avoidant like she claims, or is something else going on here?

The fact that we might have met here, would speak volumes already. 

I’m 24, working in statistical finance (actuarial path). My life revolves around a constant drive; balancing a high-stakes career and rigorous study with a commitment to my mental/physical health and my family, whom I hold very dear.

I’ve lived a lot of life in a short window. From growing up abroad and navigating the extremes of the legal system to intense mental health journeys, my perspective has shifted entirely. I’ve let go of the ""fake personality"" and social masking; whether I’m in the office or out making unforgettable memories, I am exactly who I am. No filters.

Lifestyle & Hobbies:

When I’m not working or studying, you’ll likely find me:

• Climbing or at the gym.

• Wine tasting, writing, or finding the perfect cup of coffee.

• Gaming or lost in a good book.

• Socializing or recharging my battery.

What I’m looking for:

I’ve been in long-term relationships and have even considered the structure of a traditional marriage because I’m tired of the shallow dating scene, but I refuse to sacrifice my personal freedom. I want a partner to build a ""fortress"" with: someone who values loyalty, comfort, and security but wants the absolute freedom to be themselves.

English is essential, preferably fluent.

I value beauty, but I know it’s not the end criteria.

I’m looking for a compatible way of thinking that makes us both feel loved, excited, and comfortable.

If this resonates with you, I’d love to chat and see if our vibes align. I’m a big believer in physical attraction being the spark that starts it all, so I’m down to exchange photos early on to see if there’s a connection.

1r8mtjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EVChargeRight/comments/1r8mtjf/psa_most_ev_charger_installers_will_recommend_a/,"PSA: Most EV charger installers will recommend a $4,000 panel upgrade you don’t need","I’m a Master Electrician (IBEW 369) and EVITP-certified EV installer. Here’s what I see constantly:

Homeowner gets a quote for a Level 2 charger. Installer does a quick panel look-see and says “you need a 200A upgrade or a subpanel—$3,500 minimum.”

The problem: They’re using outdated load calculation methods or padding numbers to upsell the upgrade.

The actual rule: NEC 220.82 lets you calculate real demand loads, not worst-case scenarios. Most homes can handle a 48A charger on existing service without ANY upgrades.

I built ChargeRight specifically because this happens so often. For $12.99, you upload a photo of your panel and answer 5 questions. We run the real NEC 220.82 calculation and tell you:

	∙	Do you actually need an upgrade?

	∙	What amperage can your current service safely handle?

	∙	What’s the real cost if you do need work?

Real example: Customer got quoted $4,200 for a subpanel. Our analysis showed they could run a 48A charger safely on existing service. They saved $4K.

If you’re shopping for EV charger installation, get this analysis FIRST before accepting any $3K+ quotes. It takes 10 minutes and costs less than a coffee.

1r8msi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1r8msi9/i_dont_know_whats_wrong_with_me/,I Don’t Know What’s Wrong With Me,"Hello, I’m a 23yr old female 128lbs 5’1 and I was just hoping for some advice or guidance. For the last few years I’ve been feeling really sick and nothing has made me feel better. I’m sorry in advance if this is a long post.

I feel like my brain isn’t working the way it used to. I feel like I’m getting worse at my job because of the brain fog and mix-ups. This affects my quality of life a lot and it’s making me really depressed. I’m seeing a doctor agin soon, but I’ve been dismissed multiple times for several years. I don’t care if it’s a big problem or a small one. I just wanna know what’s going on with my body so that I can work on fixing it.

*Main symptoms (daily):*

I’m always dizzy. It feels more like rocking or tilting side to side, not spinning.

I constantly feel tired, even if I sleep 9–10 hours. (It’s really difficult for me to get out of bed. When I was younger, I used to sit up to try to make myself wake up and I would fall asleep in that position. Now, as an adult, my partner brings me an orange juice that I drink immediately so that I can force myself to wake up.)

Constant brain fog, but gets much worse when I’m walking or moving around. I feel like I hit a “cap” and can’t digest any more information. Like a blockage specifically in my face/head area. I mix up words when I’m talking (like saying the wrong name or time), but I know what I meant to say. Sometimes my brain feels like it “stutters” and I have to close my eyes and reset. My eyes lag (stutter) or slow down and I need to rub them often

*Physical Symptoms:*

My chest cracks/pops often and can painful (like a burning sensation). My joints pop frequently and body hurts often especially my sternum (it’s usually tender). Frequent ear flutter/ rumble on the right side where I have shoulder tension. I constantly feel like I need to stretch really big, like I’m folding into myself. Double jointed especially in fingers (I was always very flexible as a child). I get mottling in my hands and legs from warm water. I get cold easily but also overheat fast. I sweat a lot with small amounts of exertion.

*What Makes It Worse:*

Stores / visually busy places make it 100x worse. Bright fluorescent lighting makes me feel off balance. Walking even short distances can increase dizziness, heavy breathing, and brain fog. If I push through, I get more foggy and can barely hold conversations. (Coworkers are noticing my decline and joke that I need coffee.)

*What Makes It Better:*

Lying flat on my back or on my sides makes me feel better. Staying away from bright lightings in hospitals/stores/clinics/malls, I feel extremely clear and like my old self again. But spending too much time in dim lightings start causing the same affects (headaches, rocking sensation, nausea). Like too much of a good thing becomes a bad thing. In settings with warm lighting or most lights dimmed, I can think clearly and have conversations.

*History:*

I had ocular migraines starting around age 13. MRI without contrast was normal. I’ve never been treated for migraines. I’ve always had sensory sensitivities (noise, lights, clothing textures). All other vitals are normal and blood work normally comes out fine

I’ve just come to a point where I feel like I’m going crazy and I’m going to beg my PCP for help. If any of y’all have felt the same symptoms or have any advice for me in advocating for myself I would really appreciate it. Thank you <3",1,1771467292.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False
