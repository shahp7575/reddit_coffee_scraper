​Earth Time: April 11, 2322.

Location: Trading system on the border of the Alliance and the Scourge Empire. Station ""Nexus-9"".

Unit: Private transport Sandstorm, modified Viper class.

​The darkness of space around the hull was not calm. It vibrated. The interior of the Viper-class transport shook as if it were plummeting into a dense planetary atmosphere without thermal shields, despite being in a deep vacuum, far from any gravity wells. Metal ribs groaned under the pressure of invisible forces, and the composite plating crackled as if it were about to fracture. The indicators on the control console flickered in rhythm with the unsettling, irregular tremors, casting ghastly red shadows on the crew's faces.

​Kael Thorne, a veteran who had survived the hell of Proxima B, the slaughter in Beijing, and the moral collapse of the Guard, sat in the co-pilot’s seat. His hands gripped the armrests so tightly that his knuckles turned white and the skin stretched to its limit. Despite the nanites in his blood keeping him in eternal, thirty-year-old youth, his eyes betrayed the fatigue and irritation of someone who would rather fight a Scourge assault squad hand-to-hand than endure the whims of old, failing mechanics.

​A sudden, brutal jolt threw the ship sideways as the navigation systems executed a violent course correction, avoiding an obstacle invisible to the naked eye.

​""Lena!!! Fuck, watch out!!!"" Kael screamed as the safety harness dug into his chest, squeezing the air from his lungs.

​Lena Kowalska, once a Rear Admiral commanding powerful fleets in the Battle of Epsilon Eridani, and now a freelancer in a worn leather jacket, didn’t even flinch. Her fingers danced across the holographic panels with the same blood-chilling, surgical precision with which she had once fired antimatter torpedoes at Imperial battleships.

​""I am watching, Kael,"" she replied, her voice an oasis of calm in the shaking, rattling cockpit. ""Stop panicking. The computers and radar are picking up micrometeorites and debris. It’s just a sparse asteroid belt, nothing the Sandstorm can’t handle, even in this state.""

​Another jolt, this time accompanied by an unpleasant, metallic grinding sound coming from the engine section, made the hermetic cup of coffee—real, black, not some synthetic slop-knockoff—jump in its holder.

​""Then why are we being tossed around like this, Lena?!"" Kael snarled, wiping the panel with his sleeve and glaring at the red engine performance graphs. ""This isn’t normal gravitational turbulence!""

​Lena sighed heavily, correcting the thrust vector by a fraction of a degree.

​""Because we have a failure in the inertial dampeners of the Higgs engines,"" she admitted finally with reluctance, not taking her eyes off the navigation screen. ""They’re operating at 73.2% efficiency. The mass fields aren’t stable, hence the vibrations. During evasive maneuvers, we shake like this because the inertia hits the hull before the compensators can fully react. But we’ll survive. The hull will hold.""

​She looked at Kael with a slight, mocking smile, seeing his tense face.

​""Relax, soldier. After this job, we’ll finally fix it. We’ll have enough credits.""

​""Fix it?"" Kael snorted, adjusting his straps. ""We need to replace entire dampener modules, not patch them with tape and prayer. Do you know how much that costs in certified Alliance docks? We’d have to sell the ship just to pay for the labor.""

​""That’s why we won’t be doing it at those Guard rip-off joints,"" Lena winked at him conspiratorially. ""Besides, I know a certain reptile on the destination station. Nexus-9. A good mechanical technician, a veteran of the Empire’s ground crews. We’ll sort it out after unloading. He’ll do it for a quarter of the price and he’ll do it right, because he knows the dangers of a botched job on a Higgs drive.""

​Ahead of them, emerging from the gloom like a steel monster, appeared the trading station ""Nexus-9"". It was a gigantic, chaotic structure—an architectural nightmare and marvel all at once. A mixture of human modules, brutalist Imperial segments, and geometric, perfect Gignian structures. A place where no one asked about your past, race, or death sentence in another system, but only about the contents of your cargo hold and your solvency.

​Lena switched the communication channel to the flight control frequency. Her voice took on an official, business-like tone, stripped of military roughness.

​""This is private transport Sandstorm, modified Viper class. Trading permit number: 2345901-Delta. Requesting approach vector and docking location for cargo offload.""

​The answer came after a moment, filtered through a universal speech synthesizer that translated the guttural, hissing language of the Scourge Empire officer into standard, colorless English.

​""Sandstorm, signature accepted. Your vector is shaky, stabilize your approach or you’ll crash into the pier. Dock number 4B in the commercial section. What do you have in the holds?""

​Lena looked at the cargo manifest displayed on the side screen. It wasn’t weapons, drugs, illegal Gignian technology, or stolen Ullaan micromachines. It was something that, in the year 2322, in a world dominated by synthetics, composites, and soulless biomass from printers, had become a symbol of the highest, decadent luxury and status in the Empire.

​""This is Sandstorm,"" Lena replied politely, though with a hint of irritation typical of someone who has to explain the obvious to bureaucrats. ""It’s in the digital manifest we sent an hour ago.""

​The officer on the station was silent for a moment, likely verifying data in the thicket of Imperial bureaucracy. Lena decided to clarify, however, to avoid misunderstandings with customs, which could be temperamental on the frontier.

​""But no matter, I will repeat,"" she said clearly. ""Human oak wood. Over six thousand Earth tons for the Empire. Pure, natural oak, not some cellulose composite.""

​Kael smiled under his breath. He knew that some Imperial governor or nouveau-riche warlord would pay a fortune for these planks to line their office floor with something that grew in real soil, drank real water, and saw the sun.

​""The rest..."" Lena glanced at the second item. ""The remaining four thousand tons are mushroom spores. Brown variety, high-protein. Organic.""

​The controller's voice changed slightly. Even through the synthesizer, one could sense a note of interest and greed.

​""Cargo confirmed. Oak and fungi. There is a demand for them. Prices on the food exchange in the Gastronomic sector jumped twelve percent yesterday. Welcome to Nexus-9. Out.""

​Lena disconnected and looked at Kael. The ship shuddered again, harder this time, as they entered the dock’s gravity field and the damaged dampeners ground together.

​""See?"" she said, slowing down and precisely guiding the ship into the mooring clamps. ""We made it. And now, with this wood, we’ll buy not only new Higgs dampeners but maybe even a whole new drive.""

​Kael loosened his grip on the seat, feeling the adrenaline slowly subside.

​""I hope this reptile mechanic of yours knows his job,"" he grumbled, watching the approaching airlock doors, behind which waited the station's artificial atmosphere. ""Because next time, I’m not getting on this tub if it shakes like that. I’d prefer a drop pod descent.""

​""You’ll get on, Kael,"" Lena laughed, and that old spark flashed in her eyes. ""Because nowhere else pays this well for simply being a courier and my companion on runs through the gates. And nowhere else has such company.""

​The Sandstorm slid into the dock with the hiss of equalizing pressures, carrying treasures of old Earth for a new, strange galaxy that had emerged from the ashes of wars.

​""Holy shit, Lena..."" Kael rested his forehead against the cool composite of the armored glass in the dock, unable to tear his eyes away from the alien star burning with a dirty, orange glow. ""We are 281 light-years from the Solar System. If it weren't for the Swarm Gates and their tunnel network, I’d be flying here conventionally for over five hundred years. Even with nanites, I’d go insane.""

​""And thanks to the Swarm's 'Needles', we’re here in fourteen months, with layovers at gate hubs,"" Lena replied, not looking up from the trade manifest displayed on her shoulder terminal. She was checking exchange rates.

​Kael looked at the surface of the planet rotating lazily beneath the station. It wasn't blue like Earth, nor red like Mars. It was a mosaic of concrete grays and synthetic greens of hydroponic farms, cut by the geometric lines of gigantic metropolises that glowed even in daylight.

​""Kor’kas..."" Lena murmured, sliding her finger over the holographic price list. ""I’m here for the third time. The planet was incorporated into the Empire about six hundred Earth years ago. You know, the locals can theoretically hold second-class citizenship now, if they’ve served their time and haven’t crossed the Empire. It’s a stable market.""

​For Kael, this was the first run so far out. He had been flying with Lena for five years, ever since his world collapsed. T’iyara was gone. Natural death, the end of the Ullaan biological cycle. For her, it was simply a transition, another stage, but for him—a hole in his heart he couldn't fill with any amount of alcohol or adventure. Her consciousness copy had been sent to the Source to merge with her other copies into the collective Self of a new, unified T’iyara. He knew that after this process, the T’iyara he knew, loved, whose feet he massaged, and with whom he raised Osuunn, ceased to exist as an individual. She became something greater, but also alien. She was no longer the same woman who laughed at his Earth jokes.

​Before that, Osuunn had passed away. His son. A hybrid, a miracle of nature who lived fast and intensely. He died of old age at one hundred and fifty-three, refusing to copy and transfer his consciousness into a new body. Kael, eternally young thanks to nanites, had to bury his own son, who looked like his grandfather. That broke something in him that couldn't be fixed.

​That’s why he fled into the stars. He didn't return to the Guard. After the massacre of the Church of the Eternal Spark, when he saw what his biological father, Marcus Thorne, and the system he built on the corpses of his own citizens were capable of, he threw off his uniform with disgust and joined Lena Kowalska, who had done the same, but earlier. She resigned from the rank of Vice Admiral and her pension, unable to bear the sight of mass graves in Paris and other cities that were supposed to be the ""price of peace."" She bought the Sandstorm and lived day to day, far from Earth's dirty politics, as a freelancer on the frontier.

​Around them, on the shopping promenade of Nexus-9, there was a bustle that made his head split. Kael, despite nanites sharpening his senses and filtering stimuli, felt overwhelmed. This wasn't the sterile, military order of the Guard. It was the living, stinking, colorful chaos of Imperial trade.

​""Grakh’ma suul! Preem biomass, cheap! Fresh, from the farm!"" screeched a short, hairy, four-armed trader, waving a piece of something that looked like dried purple meat in front of Kael.

​""S’trakh vut! Piss off!"" Kael growled, using a broken variation of the simplified trade language, ""Plague,"" which he had learned in transit docks.

​A group of beings Kael had never seen before walked by. They were tall, incredibly thin, but their anatomy seemed... compressed in the lower parts, like a spring ready to fire.

​""What is this local race actually called, Lena?"" he asked, discreetly nodding towards the group of natives negotiating the price of some plasma reactor parts at another stall.

​Lena looked at them indifferently, as if they were part of the scenery.

​""I won't pronounce it in their language. Too hard for our vocal cords, too many clicks, whistles, and ultrasounds,"" she stated, putting away her terminal. ""But their name in the Empire translates to 'Jumpers' in our tongue.""

​""Jumpers?"" Kael raised an eyebrow. ""Weird name. Not very majestic.""

​At that moment, one of the natives, clearly upset by the merchant's offer, turned and headed for the exit. He didn't do it with a step, however. He bent his disproportionately massive, muscular legs, resembling those of a giant grasshopper, and launched himself. With one fluid, powerful bound, he cleared six meters up and forward, landing soundlessly by the airlock on the upper level of the promenade.

​""Oh, fuck..."" Kael muttered, tracking him with his eyes.

​""Theoretically fits, huh?"" Lena laughed. ""They have powerful legs allowing for long, fast jumps. That’s how they move in their natural environment. When the Scourge invaded them, the conquest went lightning fast. They are a low-oxygen race. They had practically no modern technology. They were at the level of ancient Rome—aqueducts, swords, simple siege engines—when the Empire arrived with its cruisers and orbital drops. It was a cakewalk, and then rapid, brutal assimilation.""

​Kael looked again through the viewport at the planet below. He saw soaring city spires, threads of magnetic railways crossing continents, domes of fusion reactors.

​""Look at the cities down there today,"" Lena said, standing beside him. ""The Empire might be cruel, might treat them as a resource and labor force, but it lifted them technologically by thousands of years in just six centuries. Without the Scourge, they’d still be hacking at each other with swords over access to water.""

​""Ey, hu-mann!"" a raspy voice interrupted their contemplation.

​Before them stood a lizard of the Taharagch race—a representative of the master race. He wore a dirty work jumpsuit with the Imperial logistics logo, and an old white scar cut across his snout. He held a datapad in his claw.

​""Manifest, oak, fungi? You?"" he asked in broken English, narrowing his reptilian eyes.

​""Yes, us,"" Lena took the initiative, switching to the fluent, barking dialect of Imperial dockers, which clearly surprised the lizard. ""Cargo clean, bio-customs paid, quarantine passed. You can unload. But first payment, as per contract.""

​The reptile cackled, which sounded like a bursting sewer pipe.

​""Good female. Tough. I like those. Follow me.""

​Kael followed them, keeping his hand near the kinetic pistol hidden under his jacket. They passed more groups of ""Jumpers,"" L'thaarrs, and dozens of other races whose existence no one on Earth had a clue about. Here, on the edge of known space, Earth's politics and wars seemed distant, almost unreal. Only the cargo mattered, the credits, and not getting killed in a dark alley of a transfer station.

​The docker's office was a cramped, stuffy cubicle squeezed between warehouses. Lena leaned over the scratched metal desk, resting her hands on the top. Her face, illuminated only by the blue glow from the terminal, expressed cool, commercial determination.

​""The mushroom spores are original, not genetically altered,"" she said firmly, looking the lizard straight in his yellow eyes. ""It’s a pure strain of Agaricus bisporus, straight from a farm in the European zone on Earth. None of that Imperial biomass clone stuff. Taste, texture, smell—all authentic. Premium product.""

​The reptile muttered something under his breath, tapping a claw on the datapad screen as if looking for a flaw, but Lena didn't let him get a word in.

​""Payment terms are also clear,"" she added, putting the matter on a knife-edge. ""Half the payment in physical gold, the rest in Imperial credits. We need cash on hand because we have to repair the ship, and your mechanics on the station only accept Empire currency.""

​The docker leaned back in his chair until the mechanism groaned in protest under his mass. He slammed his powerful tail against the metal floor, causing a dull echo in the small office.

​""What is it with you humans and gold?"" he growled, irritation mixing with genuine cultural bewilderment in his voice. ""It’s a soft metal. Useless. Poor conductor compared to superconductors, weak armor, heavy. For us, it’s waste from asteroid refining, and you treat this element as a marker of wealth.""

​Kael, standing by the wall with arms crossed over his chest, snorted briefly, but it was Lena who gave the answer.

​""It’s not a question of physics, but of freedom and thousands of years of tradition, maybe habit,"" she threw back, and a note of bitterness rang in her voice, one known to everyone who had fled the Solar System. ""Gold is still a currency on Earth with which you can buy anything, even if it’s no longer fully legal. The fucking Guard and the United Earth Government want to have everything under control.""

​She leaned in even closer, lowering her voice to a conspiratorial whisper, though in this noise, no one would have heard them anyway.

​""Electronic money is trash. Every transaction, every coffee, every screw—everything is logged, tracked, and analyzed by their algorithms. That’s how they control the entire population. If you cross the authorities, with one click they block your account and you starve to death on the street because you can’t even buy water. Gold..."" she tapped her finger on the desk ""...gold is anonymous. Gold leaves no digital footprints. Gold is freedom. That’s why I’m taking half in bullion.""

​The docker looked at her for a moment with his reptilian eyes, in which respect was slowly being born. For the Empire, order was sacred, but anyone living on the frontier and doing business in the shadows understood the value of bypassing the system.

​""Grakh..."" he grunted finally, which in his language meant agreement. ""I understand. Smuggling is smuggling, regardless of race. So be it. Gold and credits. But for those spores, I want a certificate of genetic purity from your bio-scanner. Now.""

​""You have it in the attachment, I sent it a moment ago,"" Lena straightened up, a shadow of satisfaction appearing on her face. ""Doing business with you is a pure pleasure, Scaly.""

​The reptile punched a code into the terminal. Somewhere deep in the station, in an old warehouse, bars of soft, yellow metal—valueless to the Scourge—waited for new owners. The second half of the payment—credits—was transferred to their temporary, anonymous account, ready to finance the Sandstorm's repair and give them another few weeks of freedom far from the eyes of Big Brother on Earth.

​A few hours later, Nexus-9 Repair Section

​The payment terminal beeped, confirming the transaction. After the transfer of several thousand Imperial credits, their battered Sandstorm was seized by the magnetic arm of a tug and slowly disappeared into the maw of one of the local workshop docks. The technical crew—a bunch of chatty Atarians and silent, lizard-like mechanics with cybernetic implants—was already waiting to get their hands on the burnout drive components.

​The diagnosis was quick and ruthless, but offered hope: repair and calibration of the new dampeners would take about two Earth weeks.

​""Two weeks..."" Kael repeated the words as if tasting spoiled wine. He laughed loudly, the echo bouncing off the metal walls of the hangar. ""Two weeks! Lena, do you understand? Here, on this station. What are we going to do?""

​He looked at his partner, who was just putting her datapad into her jacket pocket.

​""How many Imperial credits do we have left clear, Lena?"" he asked, already planning in his mind how to use this time.

​Lena smiled half-heartedly, pleased with the profit.

​""After paying for the workshop, parts, and port fees..."" she let her voice hang for effect. ""12,000 credits per head. So we're good. For two weeks, we can practically afford everything. Within reason, of course, but the best food, smuggled human alcohol, and a hotel in the premium section will be more than covered.""

​Kael sighed heavily with relief, leaning against the railing and watching the crowd surging through the station promenade. He saw dozens of races, strange shapes, armors, and furs, but something was missing.

​""Just a shame there aren't any Earth women here..."" he muttered with unconcealed regret, scanning the crowd. ""Apart from you, of course. But you’re still a lesbian, boss, and you treat me like a brother.""

​Lena laughed, shaking her head with pity at his ignorance.

​""What do you mean there aren't any, Kael? There are. And whatever kind you want. Whatever you dream of.""

​Kael furrowed his brows, looking around again.

​""How? I haven't seen any passenger transport from Earth. Where would they come from?""

​""Normally,"" Lena shrugged, nodding towards the bright, pink-purple neons of the entertainment district pulsing in the depths of the station like a second heart. ""We aren't the only humans who arrived here. Most transport pilots from Earth are men, and where there is demand, there must be a supply of services. This is the Empire, Kael. Here, everything is a commodity. Even body and soul.""

​She stepped closer, lowering her voice to a conspiratorial tone, though sparks of amusement danced in her eyes.

​""Local brothels don't bother with transporting personnel. Too expensive and risky. They buy licenses for genotypes. They have bio-printers, the same as the military ones. They print a body for a prostitute depending on the race the client wishes for—whether human, Ullaan, or anything else—and upload her consciousness into such an empty vessel.""

​Kael’s eyes widened. The technology that saved the consciousness of warriors and citizens of the Empire from death, technology that gives ""immortality,"" here served to satisfy the oldest and simplest instincts.

​""Consciousness? Whose?"" he asked, feeling a slight prick of unease.

​""Volunteers, debtors, or professionals from across the Empire,"" Lena explained matter-of-factly. ""The client pays, the machine prints an ideal body, without flaws, diseases, or fatigue, and then the transfer occurs. After the job, or after the shift, the body goes for recycling or regeneration in a vat, and the professional's consciousness returns to the server, waiting for the next client, maybe on another planet.""

​She laughed shortly, dryly.

​""Such a prostitute can change skin, planet, station, and race five times in one evening if she’s popular. She can be reborn more times in a single night than many a Scourge warrior during the entire Battle of Beijing. So don't worry about company. For those twelve thousand credits, you’ll find someone there who will fulfill your wildest fantasies. Besides, I need my pussy licked properly too, and I don't intend to deny myself.""

​Kael turned his empty drink glass in his hand, staring blankly at the bottom, but somehow he couldn't bring himself to do it. He knew it was just a transaction, that the body was just ""clothing"" for a consciousness earning a living this way, but something in him—maybe the memory of T’iyara, of her naturalness, or maybe just plain, old-fashioned morality that even wars hadn't burned out—resisted. He couldn't use the service of a professional in a perfect, printed body that an hour ago might have been shapeless biomass in a tank. It seemed too... mechanical.

​Lena, on the other hand, didn't stand on ceremony.

​""I’m not going to wait for your existential dilemmas to pass, Kael,"" she threw out shortly, adjusting her jacket collar and checking her account balance on her terminal. ""Life is too short, even for us long-lived nanite-users.""

​She knew exactly where to go. The entertainment district on Nexus-9 pulsed with its own hot rhythm, and Lena disappeared into the crowd to have fun with a woman straight from a printer, likely choosing a model and body that would fulfill her deepest fantasies.

​Kael was left alone. He wasn't drawn to the neon lights. Instead, he found a bar called ""Under the Stardust,"" a place that smelled of burnt grease, cheap tobacco, and the sweat of hundreds of races. He ordered another drink—a thick, purple liquor distilled by local reptiles, known as ""Blindness."" This alcohol burned the throat like battery acid, so Kael, to the amusement of the bartender, had to dilute it heavily with water just to swallow it without burns.

​He sat there, staring at a neon advertisement for some Imperial dietary supplement promising ""scales as hard as steel,"" when suddenly someone touched his shoulder. The touch was human.

​""Hello, Kael,"" the female voice was calm, slightly raspy, sounding familiar, though Kael hadn't heard it in ages. Or maybe he just imagined it? ""Or maybe you are a copy?"" the voice asked.

​The question was standard in these times, but the tone sent a shiver down Kael’s spine. He narrowed his eyes, turning slowly on the stool, expecting a ghost. And then his eyes widened in mute shock.

​Before him stood a woman with light hair, with a face that hadn't aged a day since their last meeting two centuries ago, though in her eyes lurked the depth of centuries and a fatigue that even swarm nanites couldn't hide.

​""Anna..."" he choked out, standing up so abruptly from the bar stool that he almost knocked it over. His heart beat faster. ""Anna Biggs? What are you doing here? I thought that...""

​Anna smiled, but it was a sad smile, devoid of the old carefree nature from the time of their brief romance. She sat in the seat next to him, ordering the same thing Kael was drinking with a gesture, but without water.

​""I’m alive, Kael. Just living,"" she replied, taking a sip of the undiluted, burning alcohol without blinking. ""As you can see, we are both too stubborn to die.""

​""How have you been? How was your mission in Habitat 1?"" Kael still couldn't believe it. The last he heard of her was from reports; he knew she survived the battle for Habitat 1, and then news of her vanished into the darkness of Guard history.

​Anna sighed, looking at her hands, which were trembling slightly.

​""It’s a long story, old friend. But I have time.""

​She began to recount. She spoke of the fifty-year journey in a metal can, of the loneliness that ate at the soul. Of her relationship with Volkov 2 in an Ullaan body—a strange, desperate love between two lost beings. Of his natural death, when his Ullaan body simply wore out, leaving her alone on an alien planet.

​She spoke of Dakani, of the inhabitants of Habitat 1.

​""Within a few decades, humanity elevated them,"" she said quietly, bitterness in her voice. ""We gave them fire, electricity, reactors. We made them into an army in our own image and likeness."" Anna spoke of fighting in the suffocating, purple jungles of Dakani against the Scourge landing forces. Of napalm turning forests to ash, of fires consuming entire ecosystems, and of the ""True Death"" they inflicted on Scourge warriors when jammers were active, stripping them of immortality.

​Kael listened in silence, seeing in her eyes the reflection of the same nightmares that tormented him after his return.

​""Then came the truce,"" Anna continued. ""And after some time, a Swarm ship arrived. They started building gates. Those smaller, stable 'needles'. They allowed me to return to Earth in just 8 months.""

​She fell silent for a moment, turning the glass in her hands as if seeking answers in it.

​""But what I saw after returning..."" she grimaced with distaste. ""I didn't like it, Kael. Mass graves after the Spark uprising. The dictatorship of your Uncle, Marcus, who turned Earth into a fortified camp. This wasn't the world we fought for in the jungles of Dakani and on its orbit.""

​Kael lowered his gaze.

​""Unfortunately... Marcus is my biological father, Anna. I found out right after you left for Habitat 1. But I consider Aris my real father, he raised me. It’s complicated...""

​Anna looked at him with understanding. The Thorne family was always messed up.

​""I resigned from the Guard, just like you, Kael. I threw it all to hell when I saw what they had become. Now I’m a freelancer. I have my little ship, I fly routes that the Imperial fleet doesn't control. But... I don't run entirely legal cargo.""

​Kael instinctively looked around to see if anyone was eavesdropping, though in this noise it was unlikely.

​""Are you smuggling something?"" he asked quietly. ""Anna, you know what the penalty is in Empire space. If they catch you, it’s death. And even if you have an Empire implant, assuming you got one on the black market, they’ll delete you from the server.""

​Anna shrugged with the fatalistic calm of someone gambling everything.

​""Occupational hazard. I prefer that to saluting murderers in Admiral uniforms on Earth. At least I live on my own terms.""

​She looked at Kael closely, assessing his silhouette, face, movements.

​""But I see we both still have our original bodies,"" she noted, and a shadow of that old, warm smile Kael remembered from the cinema appeared on her face. ""Still with those Swarm nanites keeping us alive. We aren't copies, Kael. We aren't prints. We are the ones who started all this. Originals in a world of copies.""

​Kael nodded, feeling a strange, deep bond with this woman. They were relics of a bygone era, veterans of wars that the young learned about from digital textbooks. They were connected by history, blood, and that short time when they watched movies and had sex, seeking oblivion.

​""Yes,"" he said, raising a toast with his glass of purple poison. ""We still have over seven hundred years of life ahead of us, Anna. The only question is what we will do with them in this fucking, changing galaxy.""

​""Whatever we want, Kael,"" Anna replied, clinking glass with him. ""Whatever we want.""

​Those two weeks passed for Kael so quickly that he didn't know when the days merged into nights, and nights into days. Nexus-9, with its artificial cycle and eternal neon glow, favored losing track of time, and Anna was the best guide through this labyrinth of oblivion.

​They rented a suite in the premium section—a luxurious, soundproofed capsule with a view of the planet the station orbited. But they rarely looked out the window. Their time was filled with hot, predatory sex—the kind only people who know their bodies are nearly indestructible and their psyches too battered for subtleties can afford. It wasn't gentle. It was a release of centuries of tension, a mix of lust and desperation of two veterans seeking proof in each other's arms that they were still alive.

​Between the intimacies, there was alcohol—expensive, Imperial, thick as syrup—and a whole range of stimulants available on the station's free market, which stimulated their nervous systems to euphoric limits without causing a hangover. They talked little, and if they did, it was about trivial matters, avoiding difficult topics from the past. This time was simply fucking great. It was a breath of air for a drowning man.

​Eventually, however, the bubble had to burst, at least partially. Lena, who spent most of the time supervising the repair of the Sandstorm and her own amusements, finally joined them in one of the dockside bars as repairs were nearing completion.

​The meeting of the two most important women in Kael's current life—a former Vice Admiral and a former Gendarmerie Sergeant—could have ended in various ways. Kael feared coldness, distance, maybe even rivalry. He was wrong.

​Lena sat at their table, ordered a round, and measured Anna with that piercing gaze of hers that used to crumble battleship captains. Anna withstood the look without blinking, with a lazy, mocking smirk over her glass.

​""I heard you once wanted to arrest Kael for smashing a bottle on the sidewalk,"" Lena threw out, raising an eyebrow.

​""I wanted to,"" Anna admitted, not losing her composure. ""But then he bought me dinner, and his story was better than a ticket.""

​Lena snorted with laughter, and the ice was broken. She liked her. Anna had that same rough, uncompromising note that Lena valued in frontier people. She was concrete, didn't beat around the bush, and didn't pretend to be someone she wasn't.

​The conversation turned to professional topics. Lena, turning a glass of amber liquid in her fingers, finally asked the question that had been nagging her since Kael mentioned Anna's profession.

​""Since we're being honest..."" Lena began, looking Anna straight in the eyes. ""You're a freelancer, you have your own ship. You don't look like someone hauling iron ore or grain for orphans. What do you really transport on your runs, Anna? What’s valuable on the black market now?""

​Anna leaned back comfortably against the chair, lighting a thin, flavored cigarillo. Smoke drifted lazily toward the ceiling.

​""Standard stuff, Lena. What has always fueled every war and every peace, which is just a pause in war,"" she answered with brutal honesty. ""Weapons. Kinetic, energy, old, new—doesn't matter, as long as it shoots. Drugs—from Earth coke to Imperial combat stimulants that scramble a human brain like scrambled eggs but give soldiers without nanites a week without sleep. Technology—chips, implants, schematics that the Empire officially doesn't share, and the Alliance officially doesn't buy.""

​She took a drag, her gaze wandering somewhere into the distance.

​""I take everything that is profitable and where the risk is acceptable. I’m not a missionary, I’m a carrier. If someone pays in gold or hard currency, I don't ask where they got it, only where to take it and whom to deliver it to.""

​Lena nodded with appreciation. That was logic she understood. The logic of survival.

​""And Earth?"" Lena asked. ""Do you fly there?""

​Anna shook her head, and her face hardened.

​""No. I haven't been on Earth for fifty years,"" she said quietly, extinguishing the cigarillo. ""That’s a closed chapter for me. The closest I fly is to the Epsilon Eridani system. That’s the border. There I load cargo from intermediaries and transport it deep into the Empire, or to free zones.""

​She looked at Kael, and a shadow of sadness appeared in her eyes.

​""And from what you've told me over these two weeks, Kael... I think I made the right decision.""

​Kael tightened his lips, and the memory of the stifling atmosphere on Earth returned to him, spoiling the taste of the alcohol.

​""Yes,"" he admitted bitterly. ""It’s getting worse. Marcus and the government's authoritarianism is tightening like a noose. It’s no longer military discipline, Anna. It’s an obsession with control. Cameras on every corner, algorithms analyzing loyalty, mandatory 'patriotic updates'. Earth has become a cage. Marcus is building a monument to his own paranoia, claiming it’s for our own good.""

​""See?"" Anna shrugged, taking a sip of her drink. ""That’s why I prefer the risk in asteroid belts and the company of scum on stations like this. Here, at least I know who wants to cheat me and who wants to kill me. On Earth... there they smile at you while stabbing you in the back in the name of the 'greater good'. I prefer my illegal cargoes to their legal lies.""

​Lena raised her glass in a toast.

​""To freedom, however dirty and dangerous.""

​""To freedom,"" Kael and Anna echoed, clinking their glasses.

​At that moment, in a dirty bar at the end of the world, three veterans understood each other better than ever.

1pfi3jc,https://i.redd.it/wsg9xnsbzi5g1.jpeg,Dishes and Hiding TV Remotes,"WHY is this always such a huge problem with roommates?? Im in a college dorm with five other girls. I have my own bedroom but the kitchen is a shared space amongst all six of us. 
The sink usually looks like the photo ive attached 3-4 days out of the week- and when it doesnt, the drying rack looks like some risky dish tetris arrangement. We have ONE counter in the whole unit (which is a huge issue on its own) and I like to make food on it. Over Thanksgiving break I decided to stay in the dorms and got used to folding up the drying mat halfway so that there's about 10 inches of counter space. When the girls came back, I kept it like that every time i cooked, and one day in front of me one of the girls undid it without even using it. I just paused the TV and asked her, ""hey, is there a reason you like the mat like that?"" And she just replied that it worked better and it fit more dishes. And I was like, ""oh yeah that makes sense, but I like meal prepping on the counter so could we leave it folded when youre not washing dishes?"" She said to just use the dining table if i needed a counter and when I told her that there was no space usually on the table and that it woukd usually be cluttered and that it was more convenient for me to use the counter, she just ignored me. Like straight up just started singing and walked away. So i just send a text in the groupchat asking them to please leave it like that because I liked meal prepping on the counter. One of the other girls replied A DAY LATER saying ""actually its MINE so...youre more than welcome to buy your own and replace it but...right now since its mine you cant fold it."" So I dm her privately and am like ""I really dont understand why you'd rather me buy a drying mat than compromise with me about folding it up? This is a shared space, you caht monopolize the counter. You really just want me to buy a new mat? And what? Throw yours away?"" And she was Like ""because its MINEEEE I bought it and its MINEEE, just use the table"" and im like, right....im gonna fold it when im cooking and you can unfold it if you need extra space. And shes like thats fine just *unfold it when youre done*. And im like 🤨, this goddamn bitch, ""Yeah ill talk to the RA."" 
Ive talked to these girls about the dishes in five months maybe four times. And three of those times were individually, but they act like teenage girls responding to their nagging mom when I ask them. I swear to god my script is, ""Hey would you mind sometime today doing some of the dishes if theyre yours? I know theyre not all yours, but I just thought id ask."" LITERALLY VERBATIM. And again only when the sink looks like the attached photos. One of the girls completely Stonewalls me, the other begrudgingly agreed but made sure I knew she was annoyed, and the other agreed but then never did. 
And guess what I wake up to the next day after the drying mat incident? A message about one of the girls complaining that the coffee table is in the center of the room instead of by the window (i move it in front of the couch when im studying or using the living room) and shes like ""I keep hurting my ankles I have two bruises."" Im like just move it back. But at this point im done texting in the group chat so I just ignore it and figure ill address it if they bring it up. 
The NEXT DAY I realize the TV remote is missing. I go to one of my roommates and am like hey, what happened to the remote?. And shes like oh they were texting about it in the group chat, I guess they found it. I go to check said group chat. No texts. They made a group chat without me. Im like bruhhh. And then I realize they've unplugged my Playstation from the TV as well. So theyre basically trying to gatekeep the living room by cutting off access to the TV. Im like that's fine ill just read. These little witches aren't kicking me out. 
Oh and God. The cherry on top. There's a fucking two foot tall turkey that looks like it was stitched together with patchwork that they insist on keeping in the living room year round. Kinda quirky, kinda funny, but horrendous to look at.

​Chapter 47: Oak and Spores.

​Earth Time: April 11, 2322.

Location: Trading system on the border of the Alliance and the Scourge Empire. Station ""Nexus-9"".

Unit: Private transport Sandstorm, modified Viper class.

​The darkness of space around the hull was not calm. It vibrated. The interior of the Viper-class transport shook as if it were plummeting into a dense planetary atmosphere without thermal shields, despite being in a deep vacuum, far from any gravity wells. Metal ribs groaned under the pressure of invisible forces, and the composite plating crackled as if it were about to fracture. The indicators on the control console flickered in rhythm with the unsettling, irregular tremors, casting ghastly red shadows on the crew's faces.

​Kael Thorne, a veteran who had survived the hell of Proxima B, the slaughter in Beijing, and the moral collapse of the Guard, sat in the co-pilot’s seat. His hands gripped the armrests so tightly that his knuckles turned white and the skin stretched to its limit. Despite the nanites in his blood keeping him in eternal, thirty-year-old youth, his eyes betrayed the fatigue and irritation of someone who would rather fight a Scourge assault squad hand-to-hand than endure the whims of old, failing mechanics.

​A sudden, brutal jolt threw the ship sideways as the navigation systems executed a violent course correction, avoiding an obstacle invisible to the naked eye.

​""Lena!!! Fuck, watch out!!!"" Kael screamed as the safety harness dug into his chest, squeezing the air from his lungs.

​Lena Kowalska, once a Rear Admiral commanding powerful fleets in the Battle of Epsilon Eridani, and now a freelancer in a worn leather jacket, didn’t even flinch. Her fingers danced across the holographic panels with the same blood-chilling, surgical precision with which she had once fired antimatter torpedoes at Imperial battleships.

​""I am watching, Kael,"" she replied, her voice an oasis of calm in the shaking, rattling cockpit. ""Stop panicking. The computers and radar are picking up micrometeorites and debris. It’s just a sparse asteroid belt, nothing the Sandstorm can’t handle, even in this state.""

​Another jolt, this time accompanied by an unpleasant, metallic grinding sound coming from the engine section, made the hermetic cup of coffee—real, black, not some synthetic slop-knockoff—jump in its holder.

​""Then why are we being tossed around like this, Lena?!"" Kael snarled, wiping the panel with his sleeve and glaring at the red engine performance graphs. ""This isn’t normal gravitational turbulence!""

​Lena sighed heavily, correcting the thrust vector by a fraction of a degree.

​""Because we have a failure in the inertial dampeners of the Higgs engines,"" she admitted finally with reluctance, not taking her eyes off the navigation screen. ""They’re operating at 73.2% efficiency. The mass fields aren’t stable, hence the vibrations. During evasive maneuvers, we shake like this because the inertia hits the hull before the compensators can fully react. But we’ll survive. The hull will hold.""

​She looked at Kael with a slight, mocking smile, seeing his tense face.

​""Relax, soldier. After this job, we’ll finally fix it. We’ll have enough credits.""

​""Fix it?"" Kael snorted, adjusting his straps. ""We need to replace entire dampener modules, not patch them with tape and prayer. Do you know how much that costs in certified Alliance docks? We’d have to sell the ship just to pay for the labor.""

​""That’s why we won’t be doing it at those Guard rip-off joints,"" Lena winked at him conspiratorially. ""Besides, I know a certain reptile on the destination station. Nexus-9. A good mechanical technician, a veteran of the Empire’s ground crews. We’ll sort it out after unloading. He’ll do it for a quarter of the price and he’ll do it right, because he knows the dangers of a botched job on a Higgs drive.""

​Ahead of them, emerging from the gloom like a steel monster, appeared the trading station ""Nexus-9"". It was a gigantic, chaotic structure—an architectural nightmare and marvel all at once. A mixture of human modules, brutalist Imperial segments, and geometric, perfect Gignian structures. A place where no one asked about your past, race, or death sentence in another system, but only about the contents of your cargo hold and your solvency.

​Lena switched the communication channel to the flight control frequency. Her voice took on an official, business-like tone, stripped of military roughness.

​""This is private transport Sandstorm, modified Viper class. Trading permit number: 2345901-Delta. Requesting approach vector and docking location for cargo offload.""

​The answer came after a moment, filtered through a universal speech synthesizer that translated the guttural, hissing language of the Scourge Empire officer into standard, colorless English.

​""Sandstorm, signature accepted. Your vector is shaky, stabilize your approach or you’ll crash into the pier. Dock number 4B in the commercial section. What do you have in the holds?""

​Lena looked at the cargo manifest displayed on the side screen. It wasn’t weapons, drugs, illegal Gignian technology, or stolen Ullaan micromachines. It was something that, in the year 2322, in a world dominated by synthetics, composites, and soulless biomass from printers, had become a symbol of the highest, decadent luxury and status in the Empire.

​""This is Sandstorm,"" Lena replied politely, though with a hint of irritation typical of someone who has to explain the obvious to bureaucrats. ""It’s in the digital manifest we sent an hour ago.""

​The officer on the station was silent for a moment, likely verifying data in the thicket of Imperial bureaucracy. Lena decided to clarify, however, to avoid misunderstandings with customs, which could be temperamental on the frontier.

​""But no matter, I will repeat,"" she said clearly. ""Human oak wood. Over six thousand Earth tons for the Empire. Pure, natural oak, not some cellulose composite.""

​Kael smiled under his breath. He knew that some Imperial governor or nouveau-riche warlord would pay a fortune for these planks to line their office floor with something that grew in real soil, drank real water, and saw the sun.

​""The rest..."" Lena glanced at the second item. ""The remaining four thousand tons are mushroom spores. Brown variety, high-protein. Organic.""

​The controller's voice changed slightly. Even through the synthesizer, one could sense a note of interest and greed.

​""Cargo confirmed. Oak and fungi. There is a demand for them. Prices on the food exchange in the Gastronomic sector jumped twelve percent yesterday. Welcome to Nexus-9. Out.""

​Lena disconnected and looked at Kael. The ship shuddered again, harder this time, as they entered the dock’s gravity field and the damaged dampeners ground together.

​""See?"" she said, slowing down and precisely guiding the ship into the mooring clamps. ""We made it. And now, with this wood, we’ll buy not only new Higgs dampeners but maybe even a whole new drive.""

​Kael loosened his grip on the seat, feeling the adrenaline slowly subside.

​""I hope this reptile mechanic of yours knows his job,"" he grumbled, watching the approaching airlock doors, behind which waited the station's artificial atmosphere. ""Because next time, I’m not getting on this tub if it shakes like that. I’d prefer a drop pod descent.""

​""You’ll get on, Kael,"" Lena laughed, and that old spark flashed in her eyes. ""Because nowhere else pays this well for simply being a courier and my companion on runs through the gates. And nowhere else has such company.""

​The Sandstorm slid into the dock with the hiss of equalizing pressures, carrying treasures of old Earth for a new, strange galaxy that had emerged from the ashes of wars.

​""Holy shit, Lena..."" Kael rested his forehead against the cool composite of the armored glass in the dock, unable to tear his eyes away from the alien star burning with a dirty, orange glow. ""We are 281 light-years from the Solar System. If it weren't for the Swarm Gates and their tunnel network, I’d be flying here conventionally for over five hundred years. Even with nanites, I’d go insane.""

​""And thanks to the Swarm's 'Needles', we’re here in fourteen months, with layovers at gate hubs,"" Lena replied, not looking up from the trade manifest displayed on her shoulder terminal. She was checking exchange rates.

​Kael looked at the surface of the planet rotating lazily beneath the station. It wasn't blue like Earth, nor red like Mars. It was a mosaic of concrete grays and synthetic greens of hydroponic farms, cut by the geometric lines of gigantic metropolises that glowed even in daylight.

​""Kor’kas..."" Lena murmured, sliding her finger over the holographic price list. ""I’m here for the third time. The planet was incorporated into the Empire about six hundred Earth years ago. You know, the locals can theoretically hold second-class citizenship now, if they’ve served their time and haven’t crossed the Empire. It’s a stable market.""

​For Kael, this was the first run so far out. He had been flying with Lena for five years, ever since his world collapsed. T’iyara was gone. Natural death, the end of the Ullaan biological cycle. For her, it was simply a transition, another stage, but for him—a hole in his heart he couldn't fill with any amount of alcohol or adventure. Her consciousness copy had been sent to the Source to merge with her other copies into the collective Self of a new, unified T’iyara. He knew that after this process, the T’iyara he knew, loved, whose feet he massaged, and with whom he raised Osuunn, ceased to exist as an individual. She became something greater, but also alien. She was no longer the same woman who laughed at his Earth jokes.

​Before that, Osuunn had passed away. His son. A hybrid, a miracle of nature who lived fast and intensely. He died of old age at one hundred and fifty-three, refusing to copy and transfer his consciousness into a new body. Kael, eternally young thanks to nanites, had to bury his own son, who looked like his grandfather. That broke something in him that couldn't be fixed.

​That’s why he fled into the stars. He didn't return to the Guard. After the massacre of the Church of the Eternal Spark, when he saw what his biological father, Marcus Thorne, and the system he built on the corpses of his own citizens were capable of, he threw off his uniform with disgust and joined Lena Kowalska, who had done the same, but earlier. She resigned from the rank of Vice Admiral and her pension, unable to bear the sight of mass graves in Paris and other cities that were supposed to be the ""price of peace."" She bought the Sandstorm and lived day to day, far from Earth's dirty politics, as a freelancer on the frontier.

​Around them, on the shopping promenade of Nexus-9, there was a bustle that made his head split. Kael, despite nanites sharpening his senses and filtering stimuli, felt overwhelmed. This wasn't the sterile, military order of the Guard. It was the living, stinking, colorful chaos of Imperial trade.

​""Grakh’ma suul! Preem biomass, cheap! Fresh, from the farm!"" screeched a short, hairy, four-armed trader, waving a piece of something that looked like dried purple meat in front of Kael.

​""S’trakh vut! Piss off!"" Kael growled, using a broken variation of the simplified trade language, ""Plague,"" which he had learned in transit docks.

​A group of beings Kael had never seen before walked by. They were tall, incredibly thin, but their anatomy seemed... compressed in the lower parts, like a spring ready to fire.

​""What is this local race actually called, Lena?"" he asked, discreetly nodding towards the group of natives negotiating the price of some plasma reactor parts at another stall.

​Lena looked at them indifferently, as if they were part of the scenery.

​""I won't pronounce it in their language. Too hard for our vocal cords, too many clicks, whistles, and ultrasounds,"" she stated, putting away her terminal. ""But their name in the Empire translates to 'Jumpers' in our tongue.""

​""Jumpers?"" Kael raised an eyebrow. ""Weird name. Not very majestic.""

​At that moment, one of the natives, clearly upset by the merchant's offer, turned and headed for the exit. He didn't do it with a step, however. He bent his disproportionately massive, muscular legs, resembling those of a giant grasshopper, and launched himself. With one fluid, powerful bound, he cleared six meters up and forward, landing soundlessly by the airlock on the upper level of the promenade.

​""Oh, fuck..."" Kael muttered, tracking him with his eyes.

​""Theoretically fits, huh?"" Lena laughed. ""They have powerful legs allowing for long, fast jumps. That’s how they move in their natural environment. When the Scourge invaded them, the conquest went lightning fast. They are a low-oxygen race. They had practically no modern technology. They were at the level of ancient Rome—aqueducts, swords, simple siege engines—when the Empire arrived with its cruisers and orbital drops. It was a cakewalk, and then rapid, brutal assimilation.""

​Kael looked again through the viewport at the planet below. He saw soaring city spires, threads of magnetic railways crossing continents, domes of fusion reactors.

​""Look at the cities down there today,"" Lena said, standing beside him. ""The Empire might be cruel, might treat them as a resource and labor force, but it lifted them technologically by thousands of years in just six centuries. Without the Scourge, they’d still be hacking at each other with swords over access to water.""

​""Ey, hu-mann!"" a raspy voice interrupted their contemplation.

​Before them stood a lizard of the Taharagch race—a representative of the master race. He wore a dirty work jumpsuit with the Imperial logistics logo, and an old white scar cut across his snout. He held a datapad in his claw.

​""Manifest, oak, fungi? You?"" he asked in broken English, narrowing his reptilian eyes.

​""Yes, us,"" Lena took the initiative, switching to the fluent, barking dialect of Imperial dockers, which clearly surprised the lizard. ""Cargo clean, bio-customs paid, quarantine passed. You can unload. But first payment, as per contract.""

​The reptile cackled, which sounded like a bursting sewer pipe.

​""Good female. Tough. I like those. Follow me.""

​Kael followed them, keeping his hand near the kinetic pistol hidden under his jacket. They passed more groups of ""Jumpers,"" L'thaarrs, and dozens of other races whose existence no one on Earth had a clue about. Here, on the edge of known space, Earth's politics and wars seemed distant, almost unreal. Only the cargo mattered, the credits, and not getting killed in a dark alley of a transfer station.

​The docker's office was a cramped, stuffy cubicle squeezed between warehouses. Lena leaned over the scratched metal desk, resting her hands on the top. Her face, illuminated only by the blue glow from the terminal, expressed cool, commercial determination.

​""The mushroom spores are original, not genetically altered,"" she said firmly, looking the lizard straight in his yellow eyes. ""It’s a pure strain of Agaricus bisporus, straight from a farm in the European zone on Earth. None of that Imperial biomass clone stuff. Taste, texture, smell—all authentic. Premium product.""

​The reptile muttered something under his breath, tapping a claw on the datapad screen as if looking for a flaw, but Lena didn't let him get a word in.

​""Payment terms are also clear,"" she added, putting the matter on a knife-edge. ""Half the payment in physical gold, the rest in Imperial credits. We need cash on hand because we have to repair the ship, and your mechanics on the station only accept Empire currency.""

​The docker leaned back in his chair until the mechanism groaned in protest under his mass. He slammed his powerful tail against the metal floor, causing a dull echo in the small office.

​""What is it with you humans and gold?"" he growled, irritation mixing with genuine cultural bewilderment in his voice. ""It’s a soft metal. Useless. Poor conductor compared to superconductors, weak armor, heavy. For us, it’s waste from asteroid refining, and you treat this element as a marker of wealth.""

​Kael, standing by the wall with arms crossed over his chest, snorted briefly, but it was Lena who gave the answer.

​""It’s not a question of physics, but of freedom and thousands of years of tradition, maybe habit,"" she threw back, and a note of bitterness rang in her voice, one known to everyone who had fled the Solar System. ""Gold is still a currency on Earth with which you can buy anything, even if it’s no longer fully legal. The fucking Guard and the United Earth Government want to have everything under control.""

​She leaned in even closer, lowering her voice to a conspiratorial whisper, though in this noise, no one would have heard them anyway.

​""Electronic money is trash. Every transaction, every coffee, every screw—everything is logged, tracked, and analyzed by their algorithms. That’s how they control the entire population. If you cross the authorities, with one click they block your account and you starve to death on the street because you can’t even buy water. Gold..."" she tapped her finger on the desk ""...gold is anonymous. Gold leaves no digital footprints. Gold is freedom. That’s why I’m taking half in bullion.""

​The docker looked at her for a moment with his reptilian eyes, in which respect was slowly being born. For the Empire, order was sacred, but anyone living on the frontier and doing business in the shadows understood the value of bypassing the system.

​""Grakh..."" he grunted finally, which in his language meant agreement. ""I understand. Smuggling is smuggling, regardless of race. So be it. Gold and credits. But for those spores, I want a certificate of genetic purity from your bio-scanner. Now.""

​""You have it in the attachment, I sent it a moment ago,"" Lena straightened up, a shadow of satisfaction appearing on her face. ""Doing business with you is a pure pleasure, Scaly.""

​The reptile punched a code into the terminal. Somewhere deep in the station, in an old warehouse, bars of soft, yellow metal—valueless to the Scourge—waited for new owners. The second half of the payment—credits—was transferred to their temporary, anonymous account, ready to finance the Sandstorm's repair and give them another few weeks of freedom far from the eyes of Big Brother on Earth.

​A few hours later, Nexus-9 Repair Section

​The payment terminal beeped, confirming the transaction. After the transfer of several thousand Imperial credits, their battered Sandstorm was seized by the magnetic arm of a tug and slowly disappeared into the maw of one of the local workshop docks. The technical crew—a bunch of chatty Atarians and silent, lizard-like mechanics with cybernetic implants—was already waiting to get their hands on the burnout drive components.

​The diagnosis was quick and ruthless, but offered hope: repair and calibration of the new dampeners would take about two Earth weeks.

​""Two weeks..."" Kael repeated the words as if tasting spoiled wine. He laughed loudly, the echo bouncing off the metal walls of the hangar. ""Two weeks! Lena, do you understand? Here, on this station. What are we going to do?""

​He looked at his partner, who was just putting her datapad into her jacket pocket.

​""How many Imperial credits do we have left clear, Lena?"" he asked, already planning in his mind how to use this time.

​Lena smiled half-heartedly, pleased with the profit.

​""After paying for the workshop, parts, and port fees..."" she let her voice hang for effect. ""12,000 credits per head. So we're good. For two weeks, we can practically afford everything. Within reason, of course, but the best food, smuggled human alcohol, and a hotel in the premium section will be more than covered.""

​Kael sighed heavily with relief, leaning against the railing and watching the crowd surging through the station promenade. He saw dozens of races, strange shapes, armors, and furs, but something was missing.

​""Just a shame there aren't any Earth women here..."" he muttered with unconcealed regret, scanning the crowd. ""Apart from you, of course. But you’re still a lesbian, boss, and you treat me like a brother.""

​Lena laughed, shaking her head with pity at his ignorance.

​""What do you mean there aren't any, Kael? There are. And whatever kind you want. Whatever you dream of.""

​Kael furrowed his brows, looking around again.

​""How? I haven't seen any passenger transport from Earth. Where would they come from?""

​""Normally,"" Lena shrugged, nodding towards the bright, pink-purple neons of the entertainment district pulsing in the depths of the station like a second heart. ""We aren't the only humans who arrived here. Most transport pilots from Earth are men, and where there is demand, there must be a supply of services. This is the Empire, Kael. Here, everything is a commodity. Even body and soul.""

​She stepped closer, lowering her voice to a conspiratorial tone, though sparks of amusement danced in her eyes.

​""Local brothels don't bother with transporting personnel. Too expensive and risky. They buy licenses for genotypes. They have bio-printers, the same as the military ones. They print a body for a prostitute depending on the race the client wishes for—whether human, Ullaan, or anything else—and upload her consciousness into such an empty vessel.""

​Kael’s eyes widened. The technology that saved the consciousness of warriors and citizens of the Empire from death, technology that gives ""immortality,"" here served to satisfy the oldest and simplest instincts.

​""Consciousness? Whose?"" he asked, feeling a slight prick of unease.

​""Volunteers, debtors, or professionals from across the Empire,"" Lena explained matter-of-factly. ""The client pays, the machine prints an ideal body, without flaws, diseases, or fatigue, and then the transfer occurs. After the job, or after the shift, the body goes for recycling or regeneration in a vat, and the professional's consciousness returns to the server, waiting for the next client, maybe on another planet.""

​She laughed shortly, dryly.

​""Such a prostitute can change skin, planet, station, and race five times in one evening if she’s popular. She can be reborn more times in a single night than many a Scourge warrior during the entire Battle of Beijing. So don't worry about company. For those twelve thousand credits, you’ll find someone there who will fulfill your wildest fantasies. Besides, I need my pussy licked properly too, and I don't intend to deny myself.""

​Kael turned his empty drink glass in his hand, staring blankly at the bottom, but somehow he couldn't bring himself to do it. He knew it was just a transaction, that the body was just ""clothing"" for a consciousness earning a living this way, but something in him—maybe the memory of T’iyara, of her naturalness, or maybe just plain, old-fashioned morality that even wars hadn't burned out—resisted. He couldn't use the service of a professional in a perfect, printed body that an hour ago might have been shapeless biomass in a tank. It seemed too... mechanical.

​Lena, on the other hand, didn't stand on ceremony.

​""I’m not going to wait for your existential dilemmas to pass, Kael,"" she threw out shortly, adjusting her jacket collar and checking her account balance on her terminal. ""Life is too short, even for us long-lived nanite-users.""

​She knew exactly where to go. The entertainment district on Nexus-9 pulsed with its own hot rhythm, and Lena disappeared into the crowd to have fun with a woman straight from a printer, likely choosing a model and body that would fulfill her deepest fantasies.

​Kael was left alone. He wasn't drawn to the neon lights. Instead, he found a bar called ""Under the Stardust,"" a place that smelled of burnt grease, cheap tobacco, and the sweat of hundreds of races. He ordered another drink—a thick, purple liquor distilled by local reptiles, known as ""Blindness."" This alcohol burned the throat like battery acid, so Kael, to the amusement of the bartender, had to dilute it heavily with water just to swallow it without burns.

​He sat there, staring at a neon advertisement for some Imperial dietary supplement promising ""scales as hard as steel,"" when suddenly someone touched his shoulder. The touch was human.

​""Hello, Kael,"" the female voice was calm, slightly raspy, sounding familiar, though Kael hadn't heard it in ages. Or maybe he just imagined it? ""Or maybe you are a copy?"" the voice asked.

​The question was standard in these times, but the tone sent a shiver down Kael’s spine. He narrowed his eyes, turning slowly on the stool, expecting a ghost. And then his eyes widened in mute shock.

​Before him stood a woman with light hair, with a face that hadn't aged a day since their last meeting two centuries ago, though in her eyes lurked the depth of centuries and a fatigue that even swarm nanites couldn't hide.

​""Anna..."" he choked out, standing up so abruptly from the bar stool that he almost knocked it over. His heart beat faster. ""Anna Biggs? What are you doing here? I thought that...""

​Anna smiled, but it was a sad smile, devoid of the old carefree nature from the time of their brief romance. She sat in the seat next to him, ordering the same thing Kael was drinking with a gesture, but without water.

​""I’m alive, Kael. Just living,"" she replied, taking a sip of the undiluted, burning alcohol without blinking. ""As you can see, we are both too stubborn to die.""

​""How have you been? How was your mission in Habitat 1?"" Kael still couldn't believe it. The last he heard of her was from reports; he knew she survived the battle for Habitat 1, and then news of her vanished into the darkness of Guard history.

​Anna sighed, looking at her hands, which were trembling slightly.

​""It’s a long story, old friend. But I have time.""

​She began to recount. She spoke of the fifty-year journey in a metal can, of the loneliness that ate at the soul. Of her relationship with Volkov 2 in an Ullaan body—a strange, desperate love between two lost beings. Of his natural death, when his Ullaan body simply wore out, leaving her alone on an alien planet.

​She spoke of Dakani, of the inhabitants of Habitat 1.

​""Within a few decades, humanity elevated them,"" she said quietly, bitterness in her voice. ""We gave them fire, electricity, reactors. We made them into an army in our own image and likeness."" Anna spoke of fighting in the suffocating, purple jungles of Dakani against the Scourge landing forces. Of napalm turning forests to ash, of fires consuming entire ecosystems, and of the ""True Death"" they inflicted on Scourge warriors when jammers were active, stripping them of immortality.

​Kael listened in silence, seeing in her eyes the reflection of the same nightmares that tormented him after his return.

​""Then came the truce,"" Anna continued. ""And after some time, a Swarm ship arrived. They started building gates. Those smaller, stable 'needles'. They allowed me to return to Earth in just 8 months.""

​She fell silent for a moment, turning the glass in her hands as if seeking answers in it.

​""But what I saw after returning..."" she grimaced with distaste. ""I didn't like it, Kael. Mass graves after the Spark uprising. The dictatorship of your Uncle, Marcus, who turned Earth into a fortified camp. This wasn't the world we fought for in the jungles of Dakani and on its orbit.""

​Kael lowered his gaze.

​""Unfortunately... Marcus is my biological father, Anna. I found out right after you left for Habitat 1. But I consider Aris my real father, he raised me. It’s complicated...""

​Anna looked at him with understanding. The Thorne family was always messed up.

​""I resigned from the Guard, just like you, Kael. I threw it all to hell when I saw what they had become. Now I’m a freelancer. I have my little ship, I fly routes that the Imperial fleet doesn't control. But... I don't run entirely legal cargo.""

​Kael instinctively looked around to see if anyone was eavesdropping, though in this noise it was unlikely.

​""Are you smuggling something?"" he asked quietly. ""Anna, you know what the penalty is in Empire space. If they catch you, it’s death. And even if you have an Empire implant, assuming you got one on the black market, they’ll delete you from the server.""

​Anna shrugged with the fatalistic calm of someone gambling everything.

​""Occupational hazard. I prefer that to saluting murderers in Admiral uniforms on Earth. At least I live on my own terms.""

​She looked at Kael closely, assessing his silhouette, face, movements.

​""But I see we both still have our original bodies,"" she noted, and a shadow of that old, warm smile Kael remembered from the cinema appeared on her face. ""Still with those Swarm nanites keeping us alive. We aren't copies, Kael. We aren't prints. We are the ones who started all this. Originals in a world of copies.""

​Kael nodded, feeling a strange, deep bond with this woman. They were relics of a bygone era, veterans of wars that the young learned about from digital textbooks. They were connected by history, blood, and that short time when they watched movies and had sex, seeking oblivion.

​""Yes,"" he said, raising a toast with his glass of purple poison. ""We still have over seven hundred years of life ahead of us, Anna. The only question is what we will do with them in this fucking, changing galaxy.""

​""Whatever we want, Kael,"" Anna replied, clinking glass with him. ""Whatever we want.""

​Those two weeks passed for Kael so quickly that he didn't know when the days merged into nights, and nights into days. Nexus-9, with its artificial cycle and eternal neon glow, favored losing track of time, and Anna was the best guide through this labyrinth of oblivion.

​They rented a suite in the premium section—a luxurious, soundproofed capsule with a view of the planet the station orbited. But they rarely looked out the window. Their time was filled with hot, predatory sex—the kind only people who know their bodies are nearly indestructible and their psyches too battered for subtleties can afford. It wasn't gentle. It was a release of centuries of tension, a mix of lust and desperation of two veterans seeking proof in each other's arms that they were still alive.

​Between the intimacies, there was alcohol—expensive, Imperial, thick as syrup—and a whole range of stimulants available on the station's free market, which stimulated their nervous systems to euphoric limits without causing a hangover. They talked little, and if they did, it was about trivial matters, avoiding difficult topics from the past. This time was simply fucking great. It was a breath of air for a drowning man.

​Eventually, however, the bubble had to burst, at least partially. Lena, who spent most of the time supervising the repair of the Sandstorm and her own amusements, finally joined them in one of the dockside bars as repairs were nearing completion.

​The meeting of the two most important women in Kael's current life—a former Vice Admiral and a former Gendarmerie Sergeant—could have ended in various ways. Kael feared coldness, distance, maybe even rivalry. He was wrong.

​Lena sat at their table, ordered a round, and measured Anna with that piercing gaze of hers that used to crumble battleship captains. Anna withstood the look without blinking, with a lazy, mocking smirk over her glass.

​""I heard you once wanted to arrest Kael for smashing a bottle on the sidewalk,"" Lena threw out, raising an eyebrow.

​""I wanted to,"" Anna admitted, not losing her composure. ""But then he bought me dinner, and his story was better than a ticket.""

​Lena snorted with laughter, and the ice was broken. She liked her. Anna had that same rough, uncompromising note that Lena valued in frontier people. She was concrete, didn't beat around the bush, and didn't pretend to be someone she wasn't.

​The conversation turned to professional topics. Lena, turning a glass of amber liquid in her fingers, finally asked the question that had been nagging her since Kael mentioned Anna's profession.

​""Since we're being honest..."" Lena began, looking Anna straight in the eyes. ""You're a freelancer, you have your own ship. You don't look like someone hauling iron ore or grain for orphans. What do you really transport on your runs, Anna? What’s valuable on the black market now?""

​Anna leaned back comfortably against the chair, lighting a thin, flavored cigarillo. Smoke drifted lazily toward the ceiling.

​""Standard stuff, Lena. What has always fueled every war and every peace, which is just a pause in war,"" she answered with brutal honesty. ""Weapons. Kinetic, energy, old, new—doesn't matter, as long as it shoots. Drugs—from Earth coke to Imperial combat stimulants that scramble a human brain like scrambled eggs but give soldiers without nanites a week without sleep. Technology—chips, implants, schematics that the Empire officially doesn't share, and the Alliance officially doesn't buy.""

​She took a drag, her gaze wandering somewhere into the distance.

​""I take everything that is profitable and where the risk is acceptable. I’m not a missionary, I’m a carrier. If someone pays in gold or hard currency, I don't ask where they got it, only where to take it and whom to deliver it to.""

​Lena nodded with appreciation. That was logic she understood. The logic of survival.

​""And Earth?"" Lena asked. ""Do you fly there?""

​Anna shook her head, and her face hardened.

​""No. I haven't been on Earth for fifty years,"" she said quietly, extinguishing the cigarillo. ""That’s a closed chapter for me. The closest I fly is to the Epsilon Eridani system. That’s the border. There I load cargo from intermediaries and transport it deep into the Empire, or to free zones.""

​She looked at Kael, and a shadow of sadness appeared in her eyes.

​""And from what you've told me over these two weeks, Kael... I think I made the right decision.""

​Kael tightened his lips, and the memory of the stifling atmosphere on Earth returned to him, spoiling the taste of the alcohol.

​""Yes,"" he admitted bitterly. ""It’s getting worse. Marcus and the government's authoritarianism is tightening like a noose. It’s no longer military discipline, Anna. It’s an obsession with control. Cameras on every corner, algorithms analyzing loyalty, mandatory 'patriotic updates'. Earth has become a cage. Marcus is building a monument to his own paranoia, claiming it’s for our own good.""

​""See?"" Anna shrugged, taking a sip of her drink. ""That’s why I prefer the risk in asteroid belts and the company of scum on stations like this. Here, at least I know who wants to cheat me and who wants to kill me. On Earth... there they smile at you while stabbing you in the back in the name of the 'greater good'. I prefer my illegal cargoes to their legal lies.""

​Lena raised her glass in a toast.

​""To freedom, however dirty and dangerous.""

​""To freedom,"" Kael and Anna echoed, clinking their glasses.

​At that moment, in a dirty bar at the end of the world, three veterans understood each other better than ever.

I (23F) have a friend (22F) that I’ve been friends with for 17 years. We’ve been friends since she was 5 and I was 7. Let’s call her Riley. Riley and I were best friends growing up, some would even say sisters. We did everything together, knew everything about each other etc. We were very close till I went away to college at 18. We were still close but I could tell it started to change a little bit. She had new friends and was making some poor life choices, I was in a new relationship, and of course a few hours away. 

I moved back home when I was 20, and we were so excited to hang out all the time again. It was definitely a bit different but still good. We got in a huge fight because I didn’t  approve of a poor life choice she was making that was dangerous, and then we didn’t talk for over a year till I saw her in a store, while with my new baby. Like I said she’s like a sister and I so badly wanted to show her my child, so I said hi and we cried and hugged and became friends again. 

It’s definitely been way different since then, most likely due to different life styles. I’m married with two young kids (toddler and baby) and she’s single, lives at home, and is always going out to church events with other friends. We just don’t get alot of time to hang out. 

When she has some over in the past two years, she has bailed after an hour of being over to go hang with her other friends. Kind of hurtful, but whatever. I’ve never really said anything about it. 

Recently, she’s been coming over more often. When it used to be more like once every two months, it’s like once a week, for the last month. About a week ago I suggested we take her out to dinner the weekend after her upcoming birthday to her favorite restaurant. She agreed. Fast forward to this week, we were talking on the phone and neither of us were busy, so I asked her if I could pay her to come straighten my hair. She happily agreed (she’s unemployed at the moment) I asked if I should Venmo her or give her cash when we go to lunch. She said she needed the cash when we go to lunch because her bank is overdrafted. 

The next day (today) she calls me asking if I have the cash yet, and I replied that I did not because I haven’t gotten it yet, but was still planning on giving it to her tomorrow at her birthday lunch. She seemed annoyed and frustrated, claiming she didn’t realize that’s what I meant. I didn’t want to argue so I told her if she came over I’d take her and buy her coffee and a bagel (what she wanted to buy with the cash) she agrees and comes over. 

I get my kids all bundled up in winter clothes and start my car and take her to get her bagel and coffee and hopefully make her feel better (she said she was emotional). 

We get back to my house, and my toddler (2M) hurt his fingers and is crying  and inconsolable. My baby (9month F) also starts crying. I’m holding both kids, trying to talk on the phone to my husband, when she tells me she has to leave to go hangout with other friends. I say “okay love you see you tomorrow”. She says “let me know the vibe for tomorrow” I said “ ok we’re just meeting at (her fav restaurant) at (set time).” She says “no I mean can we hang out after too?” Again mind you, I’m holding two crying kids and trying to have a phone call. I said “I’m not sure I might have plans”. 

This apparently was unacceptable and she got an attitude and started angrily packing her things. Once I calmed down my children and hung up the phone I  explained now I could actually think about tomorrow and agreed that we could totally hang out after lunch. 

She decided that wasn’t good enough and was extremely rude and that she needed to leave and that I was being hurtful. 

I was honestly shocked. It should have been over right when I said we could hang out. 

She left and I texted her saying that I was sorry I misspoke and we could totally hang. She replies that it’s “okay and she knows I was overwhelmed and that she just needed to leave”  but it was very short and b*tchy. 

After a few minutes of thinking I kind of got pissed because even if I did have plans after our lunch, that’s my right to do so. We didn’t plan to hang after and she never expressed wanting to hang out after to me. I have a lot to get done on weekends. Saying I might be busy isn’t rude. So I texted her explaining that I felt as if her reaction was unnecessary and that I went out of my way today to cater to her needs and make her happy, even tho she miscommunicated. (which I’m happy to do but I won’t be her punching bag) I was very respectful, and just shared that I didn’t feel as if I deserved her anger, and that I had a right to have plans after our plans are over. It just went south from there and we blocked each other on everything. So AITA? ",2,1765000470.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

1pfhtmq,https://i.redd.it/c3u02qtewi5g1.jpeg,New here and struggling..,"I’m new here. Made the official decision to leave the church three weeks ago. I’ve been debating it for over a year in a half, but brushed off doubts to keep a tight hold onto the things I thought I did know. I’m sure this is a common experience for people here, but how do you guys navigate life in the chaos of loosing your faith? 
I grew up in a very small Mormon town in ID but in a family of inactive members. I decided to start attending church on my own after attending my first girls camp at age 12 with my best friend at the time who was an active member. My family was mostly supportive, but in the name of “faith” I sacrificed so so much to follow the gospel teachings. 
I was meant to serve a mission, but injured my back and triggered an autoimmune disease that caused me to just worsen the pain and damage to this day. I was so distraught thinking I was unworthy and wasn’t good enough to serve because this was beyond my control. My patriarchal blessing said I was meant to serve a full-time mission, and I couldn’t. 
Got endowed, went to a church university, met my husband, got sealed in the temple, and graduated university in July. 
My decision to leave was finally realized after a conversation with my husband revealed both of our doubts in the church and secret desires to leave. It gave me a moment to finally look at the doubts that has been staring me in the face for years that I ignored until I could no longer. 

I stopped attending church about a month before deciding to leave, stopped wearing garments, replaced my monster energy drinks with coffee, and did what the church leaders say not to: doubt. Look outside church resources into other perspectives. Into true church history you are not taught in the church. How fucked up it is that our salvation is partially dependent on a subscription service into heaven called tithing. Realized that my belief that true members of the church would not be homophobic and transphobic was just not reality. 

This thing I spend so much of my life believing in, thinking of day and night, letting dictate all my biggest life decisions, sacrificed so much for, and thought so deeply to be true, was finally shown itself to me to not be true. How can I trust anything I think now that I know I was so wrong? So blinded? What if I’m wrong about being wrong and the church is true? How do I feel peace again. I feel so betrayed, lied to, and lost. I can’t stop crying. I feel like I’m mourning the loss of someone I loved so deeply. 
I am so grateful that I have my husband with me in this journey, but he isn’t as torn up since he came to peace with it secretly about six months ago. My best friend is still deeply engrained in the church and knows my decision to leave. She isn’t being pushy or trying to convince me to come back, but I can’t confide in her. I don’t want tot shake her faith if she doesn’t want it shook.
I’m also struggling with my health more and more as each day goes by which has already been degrading my mental health continuously. 

I’ve been watching Alyssa Grenfels YouTube videos as well as Mormon stories. Watching under the banner of heaven rn. Read the stupid gospel topics essays, talked with my sister (but she left the church after a short 2 year stint in it over 12 years ago), and have found some reassurance in those things. 
I’m honestly just so mentally exhausted I don’t know if I’m making sense. 

Any guidance would be very much appreciated, since I know you guys would understand. Thank you.

1pfhsyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1pfhsyf/severe_and_uncontrollable_tremorsshivering/,Severe and uncontrollable tremors/shivering episodes - ER worthy?,"Context: 26 y/o male, history of stage 3 liver fibrosis secondary to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. I don’t drink alcohol. Currently enrolled in clinical trial for fazirsiran (mRNA drug inhibiting production of A1AT protein). Placebo-controlled, so unsure if I am receiving the drug or not (but my bloodwork has improved since dosing started)

2 days ago, I was laying on the floor and stood up to sit on the couch. I suddenly had a bout of progressively worsening full body rigors, lasting about 20 minutes. It was very frightening and scared me enough to visit the ER, however it passed before I got there so I decided to not go in. I didn’t feel particularly cold, I live in Southern California and it was roughly 55 degrees outside (this happened around 11pm). I had eaten throughout the day, but also had 3 cups of coffee (one of which was a double espresso and the other was rather large). However I regularly drink 3-4 cups a coffee a day at the recommendation of my hematologist so I generally tolerate caffeine well.

It eventually passed, so I opted to not visit the ER, however it is now 2 days later and it happened again. I am currently in mammoth on a ski trip, I was walking outside of the car to get to a restaurant, approximately 50 yards, and only wearing thin pants, a t shirt and a crew neck, it was about 35 degrees outside. When I got inside the restaurant, another episode occurred, lasting about 20 minutes again. I attempted to resolve it by drinking warm water and eating, it eventually passed after about 20min. 

Walking back to the car it almost started again, but I ran to the car and cranked the heater which helped it stop from becoming a full episode. So it seems it may be temperature related? But unsure, because during both episodes I didn’t feel particularly cold and I historically tolerate cold weather well.  

Per my Apple Watch, my EKG has been normal and heart rate has not elevated during either episode. I also have an at home blood pressure cuff at home and had normal BP during first episode.

Id like to still snowboard and enjoy this trip - and schedule a PCP appointment when I get home Monday. Is that fine? I will bundle up a ton to try and avoid any more excessive cold exposure, but obviously when snowboarding that can be difficult. Does this warrant cutting the trip short / visiting the ER here in Mammoth.
Other context: I currently have a high deductible insurance plan that does not cover “non-emergency” ER visits - so if I were to go in and get dismissed as being anxious o would likely be fronted with a huge bill. AKA I would really prefer not to go to the ER, but 2 episodes in 3 days has me pretty freaked out.

I also got back from Japan and Taiwan 2 weeks ago, and got sick while I was there, with symptoms going away about 10 days ago. Not sure if that could be related

**Several Hours later, Ambassador Suite**

*I can say without a doubt, most of those Senators are the definition of self-interested assholes! That one with the tentacles groped me, I think. Let me just look at my leg... Ah, yep, he did.* James thought as he entered his room, the gathering lasted longer than expected, which in turn caused him to miss his meeting.

Once sobered up, washed, and not looking just dreadful, he melted into the couch. A few hours of sleep were calling his name. *Beep beep.* But his NIC had other plans. ""Shit""

He straightened himself, flicked his wrist to the holo display on the coffee table to answer. ""James Niles. Access code: 6251977""

*Beewoop.* The display came to life with a soft hum. The display was black with the Federation government logo center stage. *Earth*, though not its main name anymore, still felt nice to say. The blue, green, and white ball was wrapped with a ribbon of silver. A girl from Jamaica won the design contest in 2089, when the Terran Republic had time to worry about such things. It was a cleaned-up version, but the original drawing is hung up next to the Mona Lisa.

The screen changed to an office, the top right had 'Terra time: 12:18 pm', and 'Coruscant time: 2:36 am.'

""Madam President. Hope I'm not **too** late."" He said to the figure on his screen. The display adjusted to his eyes. The figure in front of him was a fish in a bowl. More specifically, an aluminum oxynitride-made bowl connected to a mechanical body. Its figure was shaped to a human female body, not needing it since it's a dumbed-down drone, but was configured to the pilot's preference. Only a few species in the Federation use such drones. The President, among them.

Soqa Minlara, is the fifteenth Lythyian to be the President of the Federation. The clear saltwater of her bowl had a crisp effect on her yellow and purple scales. She smiled at James and spun left, then right, as a greeting that her species does.

""It is quite alright, it gave me time to go over the final proposal for the new class of carrier groups. I just hope they are treating you well.""

""The accommodations are nice. Too nice if you ask me. I think the Chancellor is trying to butter me up. Actually, multiple Senators have sent gifts.""

James listed the following: Multiple high-quality textiles, fancy weapons such as blasters and swords of past eras. A lot of high-quality and exotic meats, fruits. Copious amounts of alcohol. And two droids, an astromech and what could be described as a 'pleasure' droid. And all to be sent back to Ithaca when the first cargo ship of Federation goods arrives.

""You're quite popular there.""

""Yeah, too popular. It just does not make any sense, though. To them, we are a backwater Federation. I think the Chancellor's meddling. The guy's got an ego and is pretty damn good at playing this game.""

""Yes, and every member of the Senate has read your reports. And as you can imagine, when your FPDS report came up, it caused, well, what I could only describe as the political equivalent of 'panic'."" She air quoted with her flippers. ""Then the vote on the Amendment went through and passed easily.""

""Which one?""

""**The** Amendment.""

""Oh. That one, so I guess that means this is your last term."" She nodded with sorrow in her eyes. This was her second and now last term in office. James liked working with Soqa. A lot of impactful change happened under her two five-year terms.

James thought back to history class in school, *The Non-Force Sensitives Amendment*, an amendment so ancient that no one alive is directly related to those who wrote it. The idea came from a Terran senator, a humanist. It was proposed right after another senator force-choked him from across the chamber for wanting to push funding into 'DNA force search'. Very invasive process, didn't pass once the process was leaked.

Said senator was from the most recent planet added to the Federation. And they just so happened to be on the then border to the wider galaxy. After that, the amendment was proposed. In the grand scheme of things, it makes sense. No one to manipulate in high government positions.

""So I guess the election will move to May?""

""Yes. But enough about me. Shall we plug in?"" She questioned as a small metal arm came from under her. A spike waited patiently for her.

James nodded as he reached for his own connector. Wound up tight in the holo display, metal braided. Within proximity to his neck, a spick slid out. *I hate this part*. He jammed it into the port at the back base of his skull. His eyes rolled back as his subconscious melded through, limping with a soft *thump* on the couch.

*Welcome, James Niles.*

*Connecting...*

*Connecting...*

*Connected!*

*Connection: Secure*

*Memory Viewer: Online*

*Memory Visitor: President Soqa Minlara*

*Please enjoy your memories! And thank you for using The Matrix.Gov.*

The room's white. Well, it technically wasn't a room, but a void. Based on a scene from the ancient Terran movie, The Matrix. It allows the user to entire their own little paradise. But in this case, allowed the Federation Government to go through a personal account of events that transpired in the past. The more recent, the better.

James and Soqa watched as 'past' James interacted with the various Senators and Diplomats at the 'Gathering'. Mainly being escorted by two: Senator Padmé and Chancellor Palpatine. Both were treating him as an honored guest. Being the closest, Senator Padmé got first dibs.

Taking his arm, she reintroduced him to a tall, tanned man with jet black hair that shone. Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan, James, only briefly met him once during his first week on the planet. Another Senator had been speaking to him, Senator Mon Mothma of Chandrila. She reminded him of his sister. James examined them both, taking in their attire. Collecting data.

Of course, James covered by apologized and just wanted to admire the alien designs. ""My Mom always said I can be nosy.""

""It's quite alright, Ambassador. I never got to ask the last time we met, how long has the Federation been around exactly? I'm quite curious."" Senator Organa questioned, sipping from a skinny-looking martini glass holding a yellow-tinted liquid. A few other Senators approached their conversation, clearly intrigued with him.

""Let's see, about..."" He counted on his fingers. ""Today, our calendar date is March 15th, 3661. Soooo... a little over a millennium, give or take a few decades."" The Senators' listening eyes went wide for a split second.

""So you Terrans never met anyone from the Republic during that time? I have to admit, it seems far-fetched. It almost sounds like you didn't want to be found."" A Senator standing to Padmé's left questioned. He was much shorter than James, turquoise-skinned, with big eyes that looked like galaxies.

""Ono, glad you could make it."" Padmé hugged the man, almost like you would with an uncle. ""James, this is Senator Onaconda Farr. An old family friend.""

""Oh, pleasure to meet you, Senator."" James shook his hand, ""And to explain your question. We went the other way. Funny story, actually, the first explorer, Tom Hill, flipped an old *Earth* coin to decide the direction.""

He raised an eyebrow at this. *""Think he bought it?""* Soqa asked. Watching the interaction.

*""Maybe, but as long as I keep the story straight, it should be fine.""*

*""Gotcha.""*

Some time passed before a wrinkled hand came to his shoulder. ""James, I am so glad to see you here, and appear to be getting along with these esteemed senators."" The Chancellor spoke, a glass of green wine in hand. This caused a wave of chuckles. He was followed by a handful of Senators, all but one, James had never had the pleasure to meet.

""Indeed, Senator Farr is quite the chatterbox.""

The Rodian found it quite funny. ""You're too kind. I have to be one in the Senate.""

""James"", The Chancellor steered the conversation, ""I would like you to meet Senator Halle Burtoni of Kamino. She would be the one to talk to if the Federation ever gets interested in procuring Clones. A fine woman."" The seven-foot-tall Kaminoen seemed to blush at the compliment.

""Chancellor, you are too kind."" The Kaminoan then turns to James, ""Though I am quite curious about your people's soldiering. That one over there looks to be a veteran of many battles."" She points a withers pale finger at Captain Ramirez, who was in a corner chatting to a clone officer overseeing the party. *Soldiers never change.*

""Alberto Ramirez, captain of my security detail? He is a Vet, got out of the Marines because he was hit by shrapnel, and took his legs.""

""Bah! He would limp from his cybernetic legs then."" Senator Lott Dod, the one whom James gave his input about the last time he saw him. Still angry and unimpressed.

""Why don't you ask him directly then?""

The new group of Senators followed James to the Captain and Clone. The Captain was inspecting his clean, white helmet. ""Captain, these fine folks are curious about your legs. Mind showing them?""

He hands the officer his helmet. ""Sure."" Balancing on his right leg, he grabs his upper left thigh and twist-pulls with a *hiss*. ""Here you go, boss."" Jokingly, he tossed the leg to a senator, pale and skinny-faced. He caught it, sacrificing his drink.

""Have you lost your mind, Capt-"" before finishing, he and the other Senators watched as the leg went from a tanned brown to a cybernetic masterpiece. A pale-blue core, about the size of an old Terran coin, glowed in the middle of the thigh. Surrounded by two fast-moving rings. The power generated pulsed through the leg, beating like a heart.

""Ambassador, what is that?"" The Senator looked closely, slowly squinting his face.

""A small cold-fusion generator. Well, there are smaller ones, but they power both his legs. Does that answer your question, Senator... I never got your name."" James watched as this Senator went even paler.

*""I think you said too much, James.""*

*""Think so? I figured the cat would come out of the bag sooner or later when our ships don't refuel at their stations.""*

*""You Terrans and your metaphors.""*

The man was too stunned to speak; he studied the leg with precision. The Chancellor had to step in. ""James, this is Senator Mee Deechi of Umbara. They're one of the oldest members of the Republic."" James heard a Senator mutter. ""And very isolated.""

The Umbaran handed the leg back to the captain, recomposed himself, and smiled at James. ""I must say, Ambassador, the Federation seems to be full of surprises. Such a power source is usually in much bigger devices. Do you plan to go to the market? I know of several planets and starship manufacturers that would love to use your Cold-Fusion. I myself would love to share notes.""

The Senators around James agreed with the Umbaran. All eager to get a piece, Padmé included. The energy revolution could be upon them, or so they thought.

""I'm afraid to disappoint you, Senator, but Cold-Fusion reactors such as these are limited to military use and personnel only. The Captain here is one of a dozen who were given permission.""

""Shame, though, if it's only military use, then it could help end the war. If the Federation were to join."" Palpatine interjected, but again, James turned him down.

*""Imagine if they found out they are like fifty-sixty bucks.""*

*""Then I'd be buried alive in requests. No thanks.""*

The Gathering went on as any other did on *Terra*. Just more alien species around. As both James and Soqa watched, an interesting fact presented itself. Almost every Senator is humanoid in biological design. And more than half were Human. It was strange.

After being questioned by another group, one of whom was not human. An Anx named Zo Howler asked about Terran sports. The name Baseball fascinated them to such a degree that they would be visiting James the following day with two other Senators in his group to watch an ancient match. ""The 2016 World Series, Cleveland Indians vs. Chicago Cubs""

He finally got to try the food so generously provided by the Chancellor. Grilled Ronto, Roast Nuna, Shaak Roast, Smoked Kaadu Ribs, Tip-Yip, Nuna Legs braised in some kind of sauce. So many more that it would be impossible to try them all.

The Terran-made dishes were still in containers, even the pizza. Jennifer and the other two, who were supposed to help, had been swarmed by Senators asking questions. He pinged her to help him set everything up.

Martian meatballs, Jupiter rigatoni, Neptunian Fire Chilli, and lastly, James' two favorites. North American Southern Baked Mac and Cheese, and New New York Pizza. Classic Terran beverages such as Coke, Lemonade, and Sweet and Unsweet Tea. Vodka, Sake, Whisky, and Beer. A small barrel of each. Four bottles of wine were kept chilled. The Soaps, textiles, and clothes were left in their box for later showing.

James was about to grab a plate when a voice came from behind. ""Ah, so these are the legendary Terran meals I have heard about."" James turned to see the massive blue bulk of a man with large, thick head tails.

""Uh, yes, and your name would be?""

The man reddened, ""Really? Has no one mentioned me? I must know who!"" Before James could defend himself, Senator Padmé came to his rescue.

""Ah, I see you've finally met Senator Orn Free Taa, who represents Ryloth and its people. I had mentioned the lunch we had yesterday. I may have exaggerated a little."" She gave him an apologetic shrug.

""That is quite alright. Well, forgive me for not meeting you soon, Senator. May I call you Senator Orn?""

He thought for a moment before answering, eyes scanning the alien food. ""I will allow it, but first, may I try some of these interesting-looking dishes?""

""Sure, I would suggest the Mac and Cheese first."" James moved out of the man's way as he got a plate. He commented on every aspect of it, like a wine connoisseur, as he plated some.

He watched as he took a bite, then another, then another. ""This is delicious!"" As he ate, other Senators slithered over to see the commotion. Before James knew it, every dish was being tried. The drinks were also a big hit. One dish, though, was left alone, its steam rising.

*""Guess no one even tried the chili. Are very spicy foods a staple in the Republic?""*

*""I am quite sure. Must be the color. Someone did try it, though. Just wait.""*

They watched as two brave souls went for the Neptunian Chili. Obi-Wan and Anakin. Each ladled themselves a bowl, added complementary cheddar cheese. Then ate.

""Ambassador, I must say this is delightful. Such complex flavors I have never had the pleasure to enjoy. What gives it the purple coloring?""

""Heliux Chilies. I can get you some seeds if you like to garden.""

""I am sure those at the Temple would be very appreciative. What about you, Anakin? How do you... Uhh."" The Jedi Knight looked to his Padawan as he scarfed down the contents. Purple stained his lips as he went in for more.

""Slow down, my Padawan. It's not going anywhere.""

""But Master, it tastes like something I used to eat on Tatooine. It's a taste of home."" The boy said as he took spoonfuls of the purple goodness. With the two Jedi giving it a good review, other Senators began to indulge in the cuisine. Everything that James brought was an instant hit.

But food wasn't the only thing. Soaps, textiles, and clothes were also a hot item for the Senators. Mainly the soaps. All the shampoo, conditioner, and body soap were claimed. With orders to be delivered to apartments. James' calendar quickly became full with trade deals to every senator's system to sell products.

*""For an Ambassador, you can be quite the salesman, James.""*

*""Ha! Don't look at me, Ma'am. All the crap you had me bring did the talking. Senator Orn ate an entire tray of Mac and Cheese by himself. Senator Padmé ate so many meatballs with Padawan Anakin that his master and I started to make bets on who would get sick first.""*

*""And let's not forget Senators Organa and Farr. Those two finished off an entire pizza and a half.""*

*""And that other senator? Mon Mothma was it? I don't see her here.""*

*""Oh, her? She and Jennifer were talking when I saw them last. Most of the time, actually. I guess being the same age has something to do with that. When we were about to leave, I found the two of them on the balcony overlooking the city. They both finished a bottle and a half of wine. I just told her to be professional about their friendship.""*

*""Well, I am sure she will.""*

**3 Hours later, Matrix time**

The information collected by James was worth its weight in Vistulaium. Decades of highly covert espionage are no longer needed thanks to a late-night party. The true game changer was the buddying up that James and his team did in those hours.

After saying his goodbyes, James unplugged from The Matrix. The white of the room looked implanted in his eyes like contact lenses. Rubbing them, the room refocused. Just him, the holo display, and the metal braided connector slithering back into its hole.

He stood and stretched. *A good night's sleep should help.* He thought before cursing. He remembered the baseball game showing. He checks his NIC to see the time.

*Three-thirty in the morning, huh. I still have six hours to sleep. Then another two to shower and eat. Good enough for me.* He thought as he went to the bedroom and went straight to sleep. Dreaming of home.

**May 12th, 5661**

""It was so nice to meet you, Senator Tills. And thank you for introducing us, Senator Robb. I will send those orders, though, cash on delivery, of course."" James said as he walked the two women out of his office. The Senate provided excellent locations for an embassy that just so happened to be a mile from the Senate Chambers.

""Oh, and don't forget. Admiral Ackbar is eager to get his hands on your metals for starships. I told him about the prices, but he didn't care. If he persists, please let me know."" The Mon Cala Senator said cheerfully.

""I most certainly will. Take care now."" James watched as the two made their way around the corner from his window. Senator Menna Tills had a small plastic bottle in her hand, and would pour its contents into her hand and eat. Marine pet fish food. Shrimp Flavor. Originally ordered by Senator Christo for his 'various' fish tanks.

The mailing address was mixed up and sent to Senator Menna Tills, and she got hooked on the stuff. That was one of her reasons for wanting to meet James: to order more for her family back on Mon Cala.

""Fucking finally"", James collapsed on the office's couch, one of three that were needed for the busy embassy.

""I thought they would never leave. That was the third group today.""

Behind her desk, Jennifer laughed. Causing James to lift his head, ""What?""

""Nothing, boss. It's just that it wasn't the third group.""

""Then what was it?""

""Seventh""

He flipped over and slammed a cushion on his face, ""Uugghhh!"" *This planet is a fucking nightmare!*

*""You turned your NIC on by accident. Again.""*

*""Shut Up!""*

Again, she laughed.

""Anymore?""

""Uhhhh. Nope. Looks like you have two hours before the Banking Clan Senator arrives. A 'Nix Card', something about granting the Federation loans if needed.""

He left the cushion in place to let his eyes recover, causing his speech to muffle. ""Again? What is with this guy? But, I suppose it can't be helped. The sharks smell the supposed fresh meat and want a taste. I suppose we could use them to exchange fiddies for credits. That should be hopefu-""

*""Ambassador, you got a visitor. It's a droid of some sort.""* Captain Ramirez spoke to them via NIC.

They looked at the door. Normally, a face or head of some sort could be seen through the window. Captain Ramirez was stationed on duty guarding the door and would secretly scan them for any weapons. But all that was there was the city, soaked in the early afternoon sun.

*""It's clean, Sir.""*

*""Send it in then.""*

James sat up and watched as the door slid open, revealing a small droid. It waddled in, and Captain Ramirez followed suit. He closed the door and locked it. The droid, well, looked like a rabbit standing on its hind legs. It was bottom-heavy, standing at four feet tall.

""Hello. Are you Ambassador James Niles?"" Its vocoder was high-pitched. Almost like a child.

""Yes? And you are?""

""Oh, thank goodness! I got lost on the lower floors. I am a LEP-Series Service Droid. My name is CQA-4511. My master sent me here on urgent business with you. Or was it for you?"" The droid seemed puzzled.

The Terrans looked at each other in confusion. For the past two months, Senators representing systems and planets across the Galactic Republic personally came to see him. But this was the first time a personal droid assistant was sent.

""Who sent you?"" Jennifer questioned, causing the droid to quickly move its head to her.

""My master wishes to speak to Ambassador James Niles, but is unable to do so in person. If you and the guard were to leave, I could conduct my task and leave right after.""

Captain Ramirez moved to make himself visible, ""I am afraid I can't leave you alone with the ambassador. If they have something to say, say it to all three of us.""

The droid looked to the Captain, then to James. ""In all honesty, it's up to the Ambassador. As long as my master is not found out to have contacted you by anyone on Coruscant. It should be fine, I would just have to ask first.""

James thought for a moment as all eyes now lay on him. ""Very well. I, Jennifer, and Captain Ramirez will not tell anyone on world. Will that suffice?""

""Let me ask."" CQA-4511 pulled a small disk-like device out of a small compartment. It looked to be a handheld holoprojector. The droid spoke into it; its language crude and not understandable.

*A coded message? Guy must be a fugitive.* James thought, as the droid took several moments to get a reply from whoever owned it. But once it did, it squeaked with joy.

""Fantastic! He said it's fine as long as you have all shutters closed and doors locked.""

""Fine.""

They did so at the request of this mysterious stranger. One thing learned about this stranger was that they were a he. Didn't narrow it down, of course. Just prepared James to do what he's good at.

Once all the window shutters were down, and every door leading to the outside was locked. The droid moved to the center of the room and sat.

""He has been quite eager to speak with you, Ambassador, and interested in the Federation of Terra as a whole."" It said before placing the mini holoprojector between its 'ears'. Its head moved straight up. And the projector clicked on with a buzz.

""Ambassador James. Such a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance. I can assume you know who I am?"" The blue holographic man questioned, and a smile ran across his face.

James knew this man well, studying the reports since the day FIA informed him so. Studying every piece about the man on this cesspool of a planet. The projection made him look like a giant. Unmoving, James looked on at the man.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Troyes vs. Rodez AF: A Tale of Two Halves (Literally, Maybe)**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a Ligue 2 clash that’s less “title race” and more “do-or-die” for Rodez AF. Troyes, the league’s poster boys in a pinstripe suit, host Rodez, a team that’s playing like they’re on a 10-minute power outage at a family reunion. Let’s break this down with the precision of a Swiss watch and the humor of a fridge full of expired puns.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Troyes Is the Favorite (and Rodez Is the Underdog Who Forgot to Study)

The bookmakers aren’t just tossing darts at a board here. Troyes is priced between **1.54 and 1.61** (decimal), translating to an implied **61-64% chance to win**. Rodez? A laughable **5.0-5.9**, or roughly **15-17%**—about the same odds as your Aunt Hilda finally learning how to use a smartphone. The draw sits at **3.7-4.0**, or **25-27%**, which is generous considering these teams have played like they’re in a tug-of-war over a soggy pretzel.

The spread? Troyes is giving **0.75-1.0 goals**, meaning they’re expected to win by a nose (or a penalty kick). The total goals line is **2.5**, with **Under** favored. Translation: This is shaping up to be a clinic in “how to win without looking like a total disaster.”

---

### Team News: Rodez’s Offense Is Like a Toaster in a Bakery

Rodez AF is a team in crisis, and not the “I forgot my coffee” kind. Under coach Didier Santini, they’ve managed **one win in two months** and three straight away losses. Their recent **1-0 Coupe de France defeat to Canet** (a team from National 3, the football equivalent of a high school debate team) has left them with the morale of a deflated whoopee cushion.

Santini’s diagnosis? “We lack respect for the game and ourselves.” His solution? A video session studying “top European strikers” to inspire better movement. Let’s hope they’re watching highlights of *El Pichichi*,

Finally getting back to my favorite weekend ritual: heading to a cute little standalone café in Fort/CST for some relaxed coffee and good vibes. Used to do this almost every weekend back in the day and I’ve missed it way too much.

Looking for 1–3 chill people to join me this evening (Saturday). No agenda, just great coffee, maybe some snacks, people-watching, and easy conversation.

About me: 23M, work in tech, super laid-back, can chat about movies, books, travel, food, memes, life… whatever.

Totally cool if you’re coming solo, new in the city, or just want to get out of the house.

Drop a comment or DM if you’re in + your rough age/gender so we all feel comfy. Will finalize the exact place & time (probably 5–7 pm-ish) once a few of us confirm.

No pressure, just caffeine and good company 😊

There was a girl I used to see all the time at my gym. We’d talk pretty often—not just surface level stuff. She’d tell me about her life, school, and places she liked. It felt natural, not forced.

Right before the semester ended, I finally asked her out for coffee. She said she was really busy with exams and packing to leave. When I asked, her face turned red and she got visibly flustered. I gave her my number and she said she’d text me later. She never did.

Here’s the part that keeps looping in my head.

A couple weeks later, I was walking down the street and didn’t even notice her walking past me. I was looking down. She and her friend passed me. Then, after we were already well past each other, she turned around.

She didn’t just look back.

She bit her finger and smiled.

Her friend turned around and looked back too.

That one small moment has lived in my head ever since.

Years later, I found out she dated a guy who looks oddly similar to me in some ways—not identical—just enough that it made me stop and think.

And more recently, she popped up under “people you may know” on Snapchat even though I don’t have her contact.

I’m not trying to make this into something it wasn’t. I’m genuinely asking: did I miss something real, or does your brain build meaning out of unresolved moments?

I started trying to find ways to make meaningful gifts.  2 years ago, my son painted a canvas and we outlined his hands.  I then took the image and scanned it and had it printed on a coffee mug.

A little backstory, I’ve been single for 6 years, a combination of exiting a 3 year relationship and going through some personal issues in my life that simply put romance on the back burner. Over the past year, I have put more focus into dating and have gone on several dates with various men. I met this man online, we’ll call him John, and we easily hit it off. We have lots of things in common, we are both somewhat masculine, and we decidedly think Trump is a massive turd. Masculinity is NOT a deciding factor in my dating life, but, it furthered our ability to relate since I work in a relatively blue collar job and enjoy things like boats, old cars and am mechanically inclined.

We spent 12 hours on our date about a month ago, visiting a few local museums, grabbing lunch at a spot we both like, mini golfing, randomly exploring the showcases at IKEA, chatting over coffee and taking in a few movies at the drive in. We cracked jokes, things were not awkward, it was very easy to feel comfortable in each other’s company, he admitted himself. We sat in my truck at the drive in, on the bench seat, he laid his head in my lap and I ran my fingers through his hair. We kissed, he was a terrible kisser, but for some reason, I genuinely want to kiss him again. He ended the night vulnerably, by saying, while he was lying in my lap, that he had been ghosted in the past and that he hoped I would not do the same.

John went home, we talked as usual over the next few days and he brought up wanting to plan another date for the upcoming weekend. We agreed on a place to meet, a time and tentative itinerary. The following day, we FaceTimed and had a great conversation. Here’s where I start to lose the plot: He is an apprentice in a trade union, about to graduate in 6 months. There was some kind of drama around his apprenticeship and he very seriously thought that he and others might be removed from the apprenticeship and have to find new careers. He mentioned, on our date, that he had recently done something unwise regarding this ordeal, so this information tracks and I don’t doubt that this occurred. He informed me of the situation and I tried to be supportive, he later cancelled the date, as he was not going to find out his fate until the following Monday and would be too stressed to entertain the idea of a date as planned. Totally understandable, I would be stressed as well.

We didn’t communicate much after this, he did let me know that while he did suffer a 2 month extension to his graduation, he was not barred from the apprenticeship. He sort of vaguely stated that he needs to focus on his program at the moment and that we should keep in touch. I told him that I was glad he was able to stay in the program, told him that I really liked him and that I’ve been single for the past six years and he was the only one I was currently talking to and asked that, at a time convenient for him, that we FaceTime briefly, because I had a few questions regarding moving forward or possibly the lack of motion. Basically, I wanted to find out where he was at emotionally, because I have learned far too many times that making assumptions is not a good practice, and how much he wanted to keep in touch, because I don’t want to be annoying, but I also don’t want to lose touch. He agreed and said that he was busy that particular weekend, but we could do so the following week. Several days later, I sent a funny video which he laughed at and a short message that said the blanket in my truck we used at the drive in to keep warm, still smelled like his cologne, which he “loved”. That week came and went, and 10 days later I sent a follow up text, just checking in and I have not heard from him since. We met on a dating app, and he has not been active on it since our first date, so I don’t believe he is talking to other people.

This is where I start to overreact and my anxiety riddled brain constantly invents thousands of scenarios that do nothing but make me depressed.

I was convicted of a crime 5 years ago, which partially led to my withdrawal from the dating scene and subsequent mental breakdown. I committed the crime with NO intent, but took a plea deal due to a lack of resources and the fear of incarceration, which the plea took out of the equation. After going through the legal system and serving probation, I have documents that make a very strong case to suggest that I am being truthful and did, in fact, not commit the crime with intent and gladly offer to anyone in my life who may have questions, I have no secrets. To be clear, it was not a violent crime, I didn’t hurt anyone, and I’m not a serial killer — those kinds of tendencies show up in your late teens or early 20s, not at almost 30. Nevertheless, I have spent the following years in therapy in order to cope with the trauma. The ordeal has caused me anxiety, depression and PTSD. I have done my best to make a horrific situation that I would never wish unto another person, as good as it can be and rebuild my life. It has taken a lot of mental health work, but I believe I am a better person now than at any other point in my life. With that said, I am concerned that he may have somehow found out that I was convicted of a crime and is choosing not to speak to me based on that information. It is never my intention to hide this information, but based on past experiences, I feel that it is best to discuss after a second date, and I had planned on doing just that before our date was cancelled.

Everyone operates at a different level, I have dealt with different levels of depression and anxiety throughout my life and have always been high functioning. I never experienced the social withdrawal that I hear some people struggle with, I stuffed my feelings down and trudged on. I understand that this isn’t necessarily healthy or the way that everyone copes, I am simply sharing my experience to convey the basis of my knowledge as it pertains to depression. I know everyone’s experience with depression is different, and I’m not judging how anyone else copes.

With that said, it seems unfathomable to me that being held back two months would cause such a depressive episode that dating or even casually talking would be out of the question for 8 months. To be clear, I’m not trying to rush anything, I just want to make sure I’m not waiting around for someone who just isn’t that into me.

I know I must sound crazy for feeling this way after only one date, but there was an undeniable connection and I genuinely thought it was mutual, not just because of context, which obviously existed, but because we both said so, unless people are just in the business of straight-up lying. He also told me multiple times that he was looking for a serious relationship. This is not the first man I’ve felt a connection with since my last relationship, but this particular connection felt genuine and real.

So, either he found out about my past and is choosing not to talk to me based on that, he just isn’t as into me as I thought, or I am overreacting and he just needs time to come out of a depressive state.

Season 6 episode 6 and the scene with Andy and Nancy at the bus stop. I never noticed that Nancy was drinking a McDonald's iced coffee whatever drink. First off that's the only McDonald's product placement that I can think of in the entire series. Second I wonder why that wasn't somewhat made into a bigger deal considering how huge the company is.....maybe don't want attention because of marijuana? Maybe just a coincidence even though they couldve used an imaginary companys's coffee. Third I always thought Nancy was a fancy Starbucks drinker even when she's on the run or ""broke"". Either one of those new things I just noticed lol. Also really noticing a lot of different graphic design t shirts I've never noticed before on this rewatch. ",4,1764997471.0,WEEDS,2,1.0,False

I am in my second year at a college in Delhi and there is this girl in my class I have liked since the first week of orientation. She is the type of person who doesn’t even try but still manages to brighten up the room. We used to sit near each other in lectures, share notes, complain about professors and slowly we just became very close. At some point between metro rides, canteen chai and randomly teasing each other, I realised I had actually fallen for her.

I wanted to confess for months but every time I saw her smile my brain would just stop working.  
But today felt different.

We had a free period and she asked if I wanted to go for iced coffee at this small cafe near North Campus. So we walked together talking about normal things. How Delhi becomes Mumbai whenever it rains, how DU fests are overrated and how she cannot stand people who eat pineapple on pizza.

The cafe was almost empty. We sat outside because the Delhi winter finally started kicking in and it felt nice for once. And I don’t know what happened but I suddenly felt like I had to say it. Maybe it was the weather or maybe it was the way she was laughing at her own joke but something inside me just said do it now.

So while we were waiting for our order, I told her I wanted to say something. She looked at me and waited. My heart was beating like crazy. I just said it straight.  
I told her I liked her. Not casually, but actually liked her. And I told her I didn’t know what would happen but I had to be honest.

She went silent for a moment and those two seconds felt like the longest of my life.  
Then she smiled. Not her usual smile, but the shy one she does when she is really happy. She looked down, played with the straw wrapper and said quietly, “I was waiting for you to say this.”

I genuinely thought I heard it wrong. So I asked again like an idiot and she nodded and said yes.

I cannot even explain how relieved and happy I felt at that moment. We didn’t do anything dramatic. We just sat there grinning like absolute kids and drinking cold coffee.

On the way back to college she held my sleeve for a bit. Not even my hand, just my sleeve. But I swear that was enough to make my whole week.

So yeah. I proposed to her today and she said yes.  
I still feel like I am floating somewhere above Hudson Lane",210,1764997032.0,TwentiesIndia,129,0.92,False
1pfgsmc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pfgsmc,New Achievement Unlocked: Tries to convince me I'm gay rather than accept rejection,"**Some date context:**

• She was visiting my city for a few days.

• We ended up hooking up in the first hours of day 1 of her visit, and I agreed that she could crash at my place that evening. She originally had a hotel booked that she 'wasn't happy with'.

• We spent the rest of the day together while she did touristic things, but after 5-6 hours of that I discovered I really, really couldn't handle or stand her personality (and she didn't seem very into mine).

• She was super manipulative, controlling, jealous, passive aggressive, and not able to take care of herself at all, or feigned helplessness for attention, she would film literally everything we did, even taking photos of my flat interior and wanting to share videos of me playing small, raw ideas on the piano, she was over 30 minutes late to meet and left me standing in the cold, complained (very judgmentally) about my apartment was too cold (in Europe in December) while wearing next to nothing, slow walker, loud eater, materialistic... Really not my bag.

• I told her the next morning that I was sorry, but I didn't want anything else romantic with her. She told me she'd cancelled her hotel and had nowhere else to go (the hotel did seem legit, she'd shown me the reservations/contact with them), and I felt pity and said she could stay the other nights, but I'd sleep elsewhere in my flat.

• We had a weird 48 hours from then on. Tried to do platonic things, she hopped from agreeing with me that there were no feelings to trying to kiss and bang me, telling me the whole trip 'could've been an e-mail' to trying to say she 'felt pregnant' after protected sex the day before and that I now need to buy dinner 'for two'.

• The whole day I've tried to be as caring and courteous as I possibly could. I've paid for her all her meals, tried to make my environment cosier and warmer for her.

• When I wanna go to sleep, she's already in my bed. I ask her to briefly move so I can take off this mattress topper so that I can sleep downstairs. She absolutely loses it, springs up and starts arguing, saying how 'unpredictable' I am (I told her and re-told her by text that this was the sleeping plan), that I should be 'nice about it' (I asked her to move in a quiet, calm voice after having done 30 mins of deep breathing), asked 'is it really that bad?', I guess about sleeping next to her, I left no comment... I remade my actual bed for her to sleep in and offered her a hot water bottle, which she declined, saying, 'Don't stress yourself'. I say 'ok' and go to sleep.

• I go running the next morning, text her that I'll be gone for 1.5 hours but she can help herself to anything. I come back to my flat and she's gone along with all her stuff. No text, no note. Obviously I'm relieved and get on with my day.

**The text:**

• The text arrived out of the blue that evening, I guess while she took the train back.

• Can't even begin... I am not gay 😅 I just didn't like her personality. That's not that I take the suggestion as an insult, frankly I'd love it if it I was, but nope.

• I think she's basing it on the fact that I am quite a sensitive dude, feminist, empathetic, I might paint my nails a bit, I'm autistic so quite quiet, sensitive, have certain needs for space I need to look after... I know some lines crossover, but yeah. I was a little womanizer from the age of about 3.

• The strap on thing (Jesus Christ), she'd told me she BADLY wanted to do things to her ex's butt. I mentioned that I'm open to that kinda thing, as many people of all sexualities are, and she suggested pegging. I've never done it, have no idea if I'd be into it, but said we could see what happens someday if we have some trust. This was now 'begging', apparently.

• The name I've censored is one of my best (straight, male) friends. We've run insane Ultra distances together and affectionately refer to one another as each other's 'running boyfriend'. We say this even in front of his long term partner of about 10 years.

• 'Hall of fame' refers to the fact that the first thing she saw and mentioned in my apartment was that I have no more than 3 (out of maybe 15) photos of some ex girlfriends on my wall. They're from a long time ago, we still love each other as friends, and they were special times in my life. She was clearly massively jealous of this, and said she'd love to end up there. 

• I have literally no idea what she means about my Dad and brothers... I told her a bit about Dad, nothing about them, and only after she ranted to me for hours about the bad relationship she had with her own (no surprises there)

• With the neighbor... I basically have a psychotic neighbor living next to me for years. He's super aggressive, shouts and bangs on my wall if I so much as drop a spoon. I've tried to find ways to deal with it where I live my life but try and keep peace. Therefore I grind my coffee (loudly) before I go to bed at around 9pm rather than when I usually wake up to run at 5am. Otherwise I go about my day as I usually would, and the aggression has definitely gotten better.

• I do breath work and meditation because it makes me feel calm and regulated after highly stimulating days, again, autism.

• I would literally rather choke on my own vomit than host a loud party in my apartment 😂

Anyway. It's quite clear that she's deeply, deeply insecure, somewhat of a narcissist, and just couldn't handle a guy saying no to her. She seems like she's only ever had dudes that would essentially bow to her every wish, give her everything she wants without question, and then I come along and spoil it all.

Of course there's so many lessons for me to learn, I am very much not off my own hook. I will never EEEVVVERRRR let someone I barely know stay in my flat for more than a night of a hook up. But of course let me have it, I deserve it!",5,1764997015.0,Bumble,0,1.0,False

Decision Making (DM)

Ethical Dilemma Discussions: Gather a study group and discuss real-life ethical dilemmas or past XAT case studies. The fun is in debating different logical and moral perspectives.

Role-Playing Business Scenarios: Assign roles within your study group and act out business scenarios and social dilemmas presented in past papers. This can make the process engaging and help you consider all viewpoints. 

Verbal Ability and Logical Reasoning (VARC)

Editorial Club: Instead of just reading newspapers like The Hindu, start an editorial club with friends. Each person summarizes a different article and presents their key takeaways, fostering discussion and improving comprehension speed.
Vocabulary Games: Use apps or create your own games (like Pictionary or charades) with XAT-level vocabulary words.

Critical Reasoning Debates: Pick a controversial topic or past XAT critical reasoning question, take opposing sides, and debate the arguments. This sharpens analytical skills needed for the exam. 

Quantitative Ability and Data Interpretation (QA & DI)

Solve Puzzles and Brain Teasers: Incorporate daily logic puzzles and brain teasers into your routine to improve your logical flow and pattern-spotting abilities in a fun way.

Mock Test Olympics: Compete with friends on mock tests and sectional tests, tracking scores on a leaderboard. The ""prize"" can be simple, like choosing the next study snack or coffee spot, adding a competitive edge to practice. 

General Knowledge (GK)

Current Affairs Quiz Bowl: Organize weekly ""Quiz Bowl"" sessions with your study peers focusing on national and international events, business news, and static GK topics (currencies, awards, etc.).

Documentary Movie Nights: Watch documentaries on economics, politics, or global events. Discussing them afterward can help retain information and make GK preparation less dry. 

Overall Well-being

Exam Condition Simulation Party: Once a week, gather with your study group and take a full 3-hour mock test simultaneously, strictly following the 2 PM to 5 PM exam slot. This helps build the necessary stamina and acclimatizes you to the pressure in a shared environment.

Active Breaks: Incorporate physical activity during study breaks. A quick game of a sport, a walk, or a short yoga session can help maintain positivity and focus. ",2,1764996541.0,CATiim,0,1.0,False

Watery coffee, watery cereal, no thanks. Next.

The next most popular option is oat milk. I’ve had oat milk in coffee before so lets give that a go. In coffee? Delightful! In everything else? Thick and overpowering oat flavor. Damn, I thought we had it. Next. 

Coconut milk is too nutty, soy milk is to pungent. The solution (drumroll please)… CASHEW MILK! The balanced creaminess and light flavor is perfect in coffee, cereal, smoothies, etc. Queue the doves!

1pfghpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAmazingRace/comments/1pfghpu/s17e9_seeb_drama/,S17E9 ... Seeb drama,"Teams left over a period of four-and-a-half hours from Al Aram Palace to head back to Seeb Airport, with Dhaka, Bangladesh in their sights. I was interested to see that they’ve put a WHSmith in the airport as well as a Costa Coffee. I don’t remember those British stores being there before (I left in 2005 and have sadly not been back since), so either they were added after, or I just forgot.

\*does some ChatGPT digging\*

WELL! Would you look at that! [This article](https://www.thearabianstories.com/2019/05/12/wh-smith-honoured-with-an-award-of-excellence-by-oman-airports/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) reveals that WHSmith opened in Seeb in April 2010, just a month before Season 17 began filming! So it would have been brand new.

Of course, the American racers couldn’t give a shit. Newly ‘engaged’ (as their subtitle now reads) Chode and Stephanie breezed right past the British retail establishment and headed straight for the United Travel LLC desk. Little did anyone know that some of the biggest airport drama to happen for a while on this show was about to take place here.

C+S secured a flight to arrive at noon the next day (it was the 9th of June, and they would arrive on the 10th of June, according to the shots from the computer that I saw). As they were securing that, JRR and Tolkien showed up behind them and asked for the same thing. N+V and B+C got the same deal, and it seemed like business as usual.

Nat and Kat finally showed up hours later and desperately booked a short flight to Dubai, hoping to have more flexibility at the larger international hub. Thomas, aware that the show’s first-ever Double U-turn was coming up, was more cautious than ever about trying to get an early flight. They all should have been, but Chode became complacent, perhaps still riding high from the previous day’s victory, his engagement and forthcoming trip to Belize. He decided to celebrate his success with a cheeseburger and blizzard from Dairy Queen (another chain that I didn’t know was available at Seeb Airport; the logo was heavily blurred, but still unmistakable… plus I’m not sure of any other chains that are known for selling ‘blizzards’). Little did he know this might have been the costliest cheeseburger he ever ate.

After Chode left, Justin and Trudeau had a resounding success when their clerk found a plane that would arrive in Dhaka at 5 am. Incredibly, none of the other clerks found this option, as their route seemed to be via Qatar, which isn’t an uncommon destination from Oman.

Brooke and Clair were watching and became perturbed, asking what the flight was and if there was any way they could get on it, but were given disappointing news. Nervously, they explained to NV (Nevada) what had happened (a rookie mistake), before they separated to look for sooner flights. Frustratingly, NV won out, taking a bizarre route that seemed to take them to Dubai via Moscow… and then to Dhaka at 8:40 am. How on earth is that more efficient? Is there a TAR database that tracks the flights teams take, because I can’t fathom this. Also, if it was via Dubai, then why did Nat and Kat not also find this option?

Crestfallen, British Columbia sank into their seats at the gate, presuming they were the last ones left in Oman… but were delighted when Chode+fiancee arrived, having gorged themselves on grilled meat and frozen dairy. The two of them were further delighted to find the doctors in Dubai, bringing the number of trailing racers to three.

This heavy spacing of the teams caused a little bit of jarring for the show’s normal format of switching back and forth between teams, and we got an extended bit with John and Turturro completing the detour and getting as far as the roadblock before Nevada began their leg. I suspected the show was fudging the timeline slightly to make events seem closer together and not spend so long on any one team. But it was hard to get away from the fact that Josip Broz and Tito had really scored a major victory by running a free leg, essentially.

Gallingly, they chose to U-turn B+C, who they felt were one of the strongest teams. I was not happy with them U-turning my girls. They met Phil at the pit stop and won a $15,000 credit card.

Nick and Vick did a similar no-risk run. The real drama came when the last three teams arrived and desperately made their way to a sugarcane stall, which they needed to press to release the juice. Coincidentally enough, I tasted my first ever sugarcane just last week when it came in a mojito I ordered. We predicted that Nat would not drink the juice due to her diabetes, and I speculated whether the challenge would have normally been to have both teammates drink the juice, but they instead made this a mini-roadblock.

Then, they found their detour clue: Balanced Meal or Balanced Bricks (7/10). I would worry that being on a boat could take too long, so I’d be tempted to do the bricks, but most teams chose the meals instead. I clapped with glee as Chode got lost and had to ask for directions, giving the female teams a chance to make progress. 

Nat and Kat were first to finish, and I was glad to see them support Brook and Claire by U-turning Chode (which they said was for survival; given their speed with the roadblock, they might have really needed that time). Claire sounded ready to give up when she saw they’d been U-turned, but Brook was the perfect coach, saying they needed to get on with it to defeat Chode, who had also been U-turned.

They burned through the bricks challenge while Chode completed the meals and got lost again before finding the U-turn with his name on it. I was pleased to see B+C make it out of the detour before C+S arrived at their second challenge. They all ended up meeting at the roadblock, however, which I thought looked quick and easy, but must have been quite time-consuming.

Jill did point out there were ‘a lot of nuts and bullets’, titling the episode by misremembering the word ‘bolts’. A bunch of teams forgot the chain, as it wasn’t something that came out of their box. When Chode arrived, he engaged in some smack talk with Nat, asking why someone with a PhD couldn’t fix a bike. In a talking head, she corrected him, saying she had an MD, not a PhD. Nat responded with kindness: “I love you, Chad”. The perfect power play; don’t meet them at their level.

After Nat and Kat left, it became a desperate race between Brook and Jill to satisfy Mr Tekka, with Jill struggling with a seat and Brook with a bell. Brook won, and the shopping hosts were off, flying to the pit stop. Chode and Stephanie appeared to be right behind them, but then some shenanigans happened as suddenly the racers were submerged into darkness, the sun having set when it was broad daylight as they were doing the roadblock. I really couldn’t understand what could account for this, but I was ecstatic when Brook and Claire were announced as victorious, and Chad and Stephanie were told to leave the race.



At Elimination Station, Conathan got pretty existential, as they noted they were eliminated the day of their Princeton graduation, which resulted in them feeling as though they were in limbo whilst they were staying in Cancun. Life hits you hard after college, so I hope they enjoyed all they could whilst they were there. Then, the teams headed to a cenote with a restaurant inside and toasted to all their feelings about the race. Andie said it had been a dream of hers to know her ‘beautiful first-born’, which made her seem a lot more invested in the connection than she had been in the previous episode. I was glad to hear it. Chode and Stephanie didn’t even get a phone call!",3,1764996005.0,TheAmazingRace,1,0.8,False

1pfgh52,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1pfgh52/should_i_stop_seeing_him/,Should I stop seeing him??,"I really feel like I'm the bad person in the situation, I (21F) am friend with ""William"" (23M). We were in the same class in high school and I had a small crush on him. I changed school the year after and we only texted twice in the next 6 year because in the meantime my best friend had a crush on him but at the end he friendzoned her. One year ago my best friend was in an on and off relationship with a toxic guy and in one of those pause she got closer with William and he began having feelings for her. In August they went to a party and got drunk, he openly made advances with her then boyfriend there. The situation made her uncomfortable so she decided that they shouldn't be in contact. In the meantime he bought a gift for her little sister and because they couldn't see eachother he ask me to give the gift to her. We were supposed to meet for coffee but he never showed up, turns out he felt asleep and forgot to come. When he finally answered I chose to go get him at his house because I didn't want to have wasted my time for nothing. For context I'm a broker, I still live with my mom but I'm pretty accomplished for my age. He on the other hand is a baker since he finished high school and lives with his mother who has cancer. His father left when he was a baby and the majority of his brothers don't work so he is the provider for his ailing mother. He doesn't have a driver's license, doesn't know how to ride a bike and he had a pretty sad life growing up. We took coffee in the car and talk for a couple of hours. I was rude and couldn't stop talking because I don't know how to interact with people. I was sure he wasn't going to talk to me after but the day after he texted me and began sending me weird Instagram videos of seggual nature. When I said to my best friend that I had seen him she wasn't happy and said that I should stop talking to him because he was seeing me just to get back at her. We kept seeing eachother and he even offer to be seggfriends but I wasn't interested because I'm a virgin and I want to be in a relationship with my first. We kept seeing eachother from September to November, we went to the museum, restaurant, arcade and he even came to my home and met with my family. Even if I had a crush on him 6 years ago, now I don't feel anything more than friendship for him. We get along well but we are so different, he likes the city, I love the country, he wants to go out all the time, I want to stay home, He's a film fan and I'm a big book reader. We are literally different in everything except the fact that we both don't have a father. I felt bad because I know he's trying to escape the abuse from his mother and he's stuck with a job he doesn't enjoy with friend and family that don't push him to be his best version. In November I began to feel like seeing him took too much of my energy, it felt like a chore. My friend finally broke up with her toxic boyfriend and William thought that he would finally be in a relationship with her but she's not interested anymore. One week ago we were supposed to go ice skating but I told him the truth, that my car broke down, I have a lot of work and I went back to study so I don't really have time and I don't feel like going out. He said that it was ok. I thought that he would finally stopped talking to me but today he texted me asking me if I was still unavailable. I don't know what to do. I felted so relieved when I thought that I wouldn't see him anymore but I feel bad because he deserves to have someone to care for him but I don't want to be this person.

1pfggxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ecoflow_community/comments/1pfggxx/my_time_at_ecoflow_aka_cross_fingers_we_bought/,"""My Time At Ecoflow"" - aka Cross Fingers, We Bought Certified Refurbished DELTA Pro 3's From Ecoflow's eBay.  Slight Upgrade","As noted elsewhere, our setup is a Smart Home Panel 2 and a variety of Ecoflow devices scattered around.  Two DELTA Pro units run the panel; the others serve as a buffer against significant consumption as well as redundant coverage and in some cases UPS.

# Fast forward: how are things working?

Frankly, there's not been a single problem since getting past the firmware nonsense.  There are annoyances:

* Not being able to control which ""leg"" pulls on which circuit when using DELTA Pro with the Double Voltage Hub.  Only split-phase efficiently draws from both.
* Since the units are effectively connected via AC, they are limited on how fast they can recharge.  It's not ""slow"", but it would have been nicer to get up to 50% in a pinch.
* StormGuard doesn't appear to work properly.  There have been at least two major snowstorms yet the device never triggered to charge up.  We ended up just letting grid run with topped-off batteries for the two days in question (and there were two outages; though they only lasted a minute each).
* When one unit hits the bottom SoC (10%), it will refuse to allow them to power the Panel even when you charge them back up to 20% or higher.  
* The ""Savings"" widget only cares about the off-peak price and solar offset.  It doesn't account for savings borne from conservation.  So for example, if you normally have two circuits running trickle from grid all day (i.e. the garage) but on the Panel you disable them during peak, that's savings.  It doesn't include this.
* Ecoflow Support confirmed that DELTA Pro can only ever be 2 units deep, meaning a max capacity of \~22kWh.  That's slightly lower than the daily average for a home, but during extreme weather periods whatever devices might kick it over the edge.  

# ...But you said you bought DELTA Pro 3s.  Why?

See, this took a lot of soul searching and money compare.  Buying a DELTA Pro Ultra would allow additional capacity with our current Pro units, because the regular Ultra can plug in to AC side-by-side with the existing, plus significant scalability should we choose.  But the Ultra is a big, hulking, heavy thing, and our setup is in a basement with stairs that suck to go down.  It wasn't appealing to think about.

Getting three DELTA Pro 3s is less capacity, but they're greatly easier to move around.  Additionally, they are compatible with the existing DELTA Pro batteries - something the Ultra for bizarre reasons lacks.  And the Generator 4000 can charge the DELTA Pro's batteries separately; meaning we can juice and swap without losing active power and without having to be concerned about carbon monoxide poisoning due to the stupidly short charging cable Ecoflow provides (and the 5m cable has been out of stock for months.  Come on u/Ecoflow_official, time to get stock back in already).

This created an opportunity: one of the Pros can go back into the kitchen where it's desperately needed to run air fryer/microwave or air fryer/coffee maker or toaster/coffee maker combos without popping the GFCI.  The other Pro can provide coverage for the great room (where ""Main"" is currently happily holding stuff down). 

# What's this about eBay?

Oh, you didn't know?  Ecoflow sells Certified Refurbished units via eBay.  On occasions there are extra deals as well that drop the price to their more ""normal"" levels.  A DELTA Pro 3, right now, is less than $1800.  Given it's arguably Ecoflow's most well-rounded unit of the entire lineup, that's an amazing deal.  The tradeoff is the potential for cosmetic damage on the housing; which for something that sits unseen in the basement was a non-issue for us.

The DELTA Pro Ultra's Certified Refurbished price was also amazing; but again, as long as our connection point is in the basement, we just can't do it.  AT some point, if we can frame out a first floor utility room and route the connection box into there, we'll look into the DELTA Pro Ultra; but then we'd have to justify the loss of being able to reuse existing capacity.

# Is DELTA Pro 3's capacity going to be enough?

Well, put it this way.  We installed a steam humidifier last month that eats a good 2400 watts when it runs, plus a room that needs a dehumidifier for another good 600 watts the majority of the day. Steam humidifier during proper winter is the only way to keep relative humidity from dipping into dangerous respiratory territory.

The current 22kWh capacity (using it for peak shedding, not backup) has been good enough for \~11.5 hours covering basically every active circuit in the place, which basically sends 99% of our usage right to off-peak pricing.  And just to be clear: this is without  conserving.  All devices we normally use, stuff plugged in, stuff running, HVAC (including steam humidifier) even lights left on, etc. is as per usual.

[Savings chart.](https://preview.redd.it/z8ew4hrdfi5g1.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c41ffc2eb2f473ea1ee9053ba68c659f425cdfc)

Notice the numbers.  In just five days with only peak shedding, the Ecoflow reports a calculated savings of almost $25, *in winter* (i.e. little-to-no-solar).  That's really not bad, and it means that 22kWh has been enough for our purpose.  The other $16-17 was before we moved all of the other circuits into the Panel.

A max of 36kWh for the Pro 3's means a bit more capacity, more balanced consumption of circuits, and more coverage for our plugged in devices from the outbound units.  If anything goes wrong with the Pro 3s we can always return the Pros to active service.

There's also the Generator 4000 sitting out back in the container waiting for its first emergency to be called into service.  The Generator 4000 works directly with the Pro 3, unlike the regular Pro, so if Ecoflow gets its act together and gets more extra battery cables we can consider a direct connect.

# Summary

Just to be clear: quite a bit of money was spent on our setup, but every device barring ""Main"" was bough at steep discounts.  We have a *lot* of devices.  But (A) energy bills are under full control and (B) we have backup in a pinch.

Buying Certified Refurbished anything comes with risks.  But it's possible they perform just as good as new at a fraction of the asking price.  For anyone that is interested in any device, don't overlook the official Ecoflow eBay account's deals.",1,1764995925.0,Ecoflow_community,0,0.67,False

I first noticed her in the office cafeteria and it was an instant crush. I kept daydreaming about her and imagining her as my girlfriend.

After hyping myself up for days, I gathered courage to finally send her a message on office Teams:
“Hi X, I'm Y working in ** team, I've seen you around in cafeteria and seemed like a friendly person , would it be okay if I ask you out on a coffee” And that was it. Left on seen. No reply at all. She could’ve at least said “no” 😂

I accepted the L and tried to move on. 

But fast forward about two weeks, and things changed a bit. She’s looked at me multiple times in the cafeteria, and we’ve had solid eye contact. I feel like this might be the first time she’s actually seen me properly in person.

Now we’ve been having eye contact almost daily, and I’m confused. I don’t want to message her again on Teams because that might come off as pushy or even get me into trouble at work.

So, i've only had one boyfriend until now and we dated for 2.5 years. I loved him very much and we had to separate because of religious differences and the fact that we both had different goals in life. So, we broke up in good terms.



I was with him since i was 17 and before that i had never been or dated anyone. I met a guy (24M) on reddit (on my state's subreddit ) and we would talk to eachother strictly about our state pcs exams and help eachother with the prep. I wanna make it clear that the guy had no idea i was a woman either. And then i had my mains exam after 3 days of breaking up.

And guess what? The reddit guy? i meet him!!! He was literally a mutual friend of my school's senior. And then we both were so surprised to meet a redditor in the wild.
After that, we started going from texting strictly about exam prep to like daily life together.


The exam consisted of like 2 stages on two days so on the second day he walked me to the bus stand too. Then we started talking like everyday since then.

Once i was just out doing my chores and i bumped into him and we went for a coffee.
And then, we went to the zoo.


We both like each other a lot & it's super evident. The attraction is undeniable. But i really don't want to date anyone right after breaking up.


I told the guy too about my breakup. It seems he is also in a similar boat ( he is studying for PCS exams seriously) plus he also has a job already so he’s got a lot going on. We both are against commitment rn and we both are aware of it yet we can't stay away from eachother.
Perhaps im using him to move on from my ex. I told him and he says he doesn't mind.
But i feel guilty.


Ive been quite a prude for my whole life and feel awkward to talk about sex to anyone. But, with him, like idk what happens to me. Things take a sexual turn and i honestly like it. We've sexted but thats it. I'd never sleep with someone im not dating. so Yeah.

I just got prescribed levothyroxine and this is my first time taking anything for thyroid. I know about the empty stomach rule, but what if I forget and end up drinking that cup of creamed coffee first? It's usually the very first thing I do in the morning. Afraid autopilot will kick in. How long after the cup of coffee would I have to wait until I could take the meds and not lose effectiveness? Does 60 minutes also work on that side of the equation, if it's just liquids? Is it more like 3 hours?

Also, I'm assuming plain herbal tea is fine? That's usually my substitute when I can't have coffee, because at least it's hot and has some flavor.

1pfgaot,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1pfgaot/my_unsolicited_tips/,My Unsolicited Tips,"Here are a few tips and observations I learned while in Japan that I didn’t see mentioned in any of my research before we traveled.

- When you get Shinkansen tickets that also include tickets for a transfer or a basic fare, you put all the tickets you receive into one stack and feed the whole stack into the ticket gate in one go.

- If an error occurs when exiting a train gate, there will be an intercom button by the gate to ask for assistance. Just tell them what station you left from and a station agent will ask you to scan your Suica again and they’ll let you thru.

- The color coding for trains on Google Maps usually matches a color accent found on the actual train itself. If you’re not certain what train you’re looking at, just look for the color you’re seeing on Google Maps.

- Water refill stations are not very common. I’d fill my water bottle each morning but would inevitably need to use a vending machine to buy another bottle of water most days.

- Restaurants that serve breakfast are not very common and most cafes that serve coffee don’t open until 10am or later. You’ll likely need to become an afternoon coffee drinker if you’re seeking out nice, barista style coffee drinks from a local cafe.

- It seems like most buildings/train stations/shopping complexes keep the coolest and most interesting stuff on the top floors. If you’re in a building that has rooftop access from an elevator or escalator, go check out the rooftop. There’s probably something super cool up there.

- Gotchapon machines really are everywhere but unless a machine has items that are obviously specific to that location, you’re likely to find the same machines over and over again. I found that the machines in  the shopping areas of Akihabra and Shibuya had the most generic gotchapon options. You’re likely to see those same machines everywhere else you’re traveling to.

- The interior of most buildings are kept pretty warm and toasty. I would usually need to shed a few layers after being inside for a few minutes. This was in November so maybe the heat was just getting adjusted but we were definitely feeling HOT in some malls and hotels we stayed at.

- If you’re wanting to buy tax free, make sure your purchases will total over ¥5,000 before checking out. I didn’t know what my total was when checking out at the Don Quixote tax free register and the teller rounded up my ¥3800 purchase to ¥5000 and I said nothing like a schmuck lol.

- Don’t take pictures of shop items in small stores. Even if there’s no sign warning against it, just don’t take pictures of things in shops. Saw a few instances of tourists being scolded by staff for taking pictures of random knick knacks in their store.

- Japanese food is great but no one told me the burgers and pizza are good as hell too. I’d suggest having at least one western style meal while you’re there. It’ll probably be slightly different from what you’re accustomed to.",0,1764995348.0,JapanTravelTips,10,0.4,False

1pfg81v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bible/comments/1pfg81v/what_scripture_biblical_advice_has_had_the/,What scripture / Biblical advice has had the greatest impact on how you live your life?  What made you believe the author was qualified to give you that advice?,"""Jesus said to Martha, 'I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live.  
26 'And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?'"" (John 11:25-26) 

In this passage, Jesus says something that most of us don't hear from any other source.  I think we humans are geared to search for answers to spiritual questions.  We're prone to seek truth outside ourselves because we know we don't have it all.  It's human nature to look to an earthly parent-figure for answers if we were raised by people who seemed to ""have it all together."" But our Messiah tells us, ""Call no man on earth 'father,' for one is your Father, He who is in heaven -- and you are all brothers. And do not be called teachers; for One is your Teacher, the Messiah."" ([Matthew 23:9-10](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/mat/23/9-10/s_952009), [Jeremiah 3:19](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/jer/3/19/s_748019))

Life is a classroom. The lesson God wants to teach us is how to live forever, in unity with Him and each other. Unfortunately, humanity without God either accepts death as part of life, or tries to find ways to live forever for selfish or pointless reasons. We have to look for answers from a teacher we want to emulate. Jesus showed us that He knew how to live forever by rising from the dead. He showed us how to make eternal life worth living with His teachings and His love. We aspire, as Enoch did, to learn to walk with God and become His eternal children.

Knowing who to learn from is of limited value if we think we already know what's being taught, and rush through our lessons. We've all heard ""love your neighbor as yourself,"" but how many of us love ourselves enough to make healthy choices all the time?  How often is my neighbor's emergency as high a priority as my own?  
We have to admit it when we're in the dark -- not just as an admission to ourselves, but to those who depend on us.  Facing our human insufficiency together lets us reach out to our Savior in unity.  ""Wherever two or three are gathered, there I am in their midst.""  ([Matthew 18:20](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/mat/18/20/s_947020), [Malachi 3:16-17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mal/3/16-17/s_928017))  I didn't realize how powerful this was until my grown son said the best thing I did as a parent was to tell him that someday he would figure out that I'm not perfect, and that I hoped he still loved me when it happened. 

I'm blessed by Charles Spurgeon's interpretation of Jesus' parable, The Pearl of Great Price. He said that for Jesus, we humans were the pearls of great price and the hidden treasure that Jesus gave up everything for.  When we truly appreciate the depth of suffering Messiah went through for us, it changes our hearts. He becomes our Pearl; our greatest pursuit in life.  He's worth everything we give up so we can be His hands and feet to the world.  I could barely give up a cup of coffee for the sake of a higher good when the Lord blessed me with this truth.  I'm thankful He doesn't leave us like He finds us!  ([Luke 14:27-33](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/luk/14/27-33/s_987030), [Romans 12:1-2](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/rom/12/1-2/s_1058002), [Ezekiel 16:6](https://www.blueletterbible.org/rsv/eze/16/6/s_818006))  

I don't know how Jesus does it, but His parables keep me on track so I can draw closer and closer to Him.  When we, like the pearl merchant, give up worldly pursuits to have Jesus, for awhile, we have nothing but our precious Pearl.  Without our creature comforts, we find ourselves in the lowest earthly room at the wedding feast of His word. ([Job 23:12](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/job/23/12/s_459012), [Psalm 100:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/psa/100/3/s_578003), [John 1:1-4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/jhn/1/1-4/s_998001), [John 1:14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/jhn/1/14/s_998014), [John 6:35](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/jhn/6/35/s_1003035), [Song 2:4](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/sng/2/4/s_673004)) 

(Luke 14:10-11 NKJV)  
>10 ""But when you are invited, go and sit down in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes he may say to you, 'Friend, go up higher.' Then you will have glory in the presence of those who sit at the table with you.  
11 ""For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.""  

*Our Father in heaven, Your authority is above all authority and Your name is sacred.*  
*We come before You today, to thank You for Your kindness, patience, and mercy. We ask that You would teach us how to love in the way You require; humbly, dutifully, loyally, responsibly, cheerfully, and in a spirit of compassion.  Transform us into Your likeness, Father.  Make us more like Your holy Child, Jesus Christ.  Give us opportunities to love and be loved.  Help us not miss a single chance to show Your love to our families, friends, and neighbors.  
Thank You for hearing our prayer.  We know that whatever we ask within Your will, You will provide.  We praise You, Maker of heaven and earth. We dedicate ourselves into Your service, Father.  Use us for the good of Your kingdom. In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.*

I know we are a group on focusing on protein but is 24 hour fasting or more (25 and a half rn) with just making myself a good meal with an appetizer to warm up decent? I also mostly want to make upper body gains as that’s my weak spot and don’t understand the workout portion yet either but I imagine I can go peruse the group info for that. 

Like right now I’m about to have some instant millet noodle miso soup then I’m going to have some homemade orange brown sugar kefir water with lentil curry soup pea protein tofu and spinach. I’m also a night owl who has adrenaline issues rn so I’m going to work out to burn that off after. Decent start?

I’ve been working up to this last longest fast for a few weeks now and I just hold out until I start to become uncomfortable emotionally and physically which for me is despondency and restlessness coupled with confusion. My skin has already improved so has my weight which has dropped from 127-133 to 120-125. I also feel as if I’m regaining my enjoyment of slow eating and treating myself. My body feels less tense. I feel more organized in thought. My sense of hopelessness from going through court for abuse right now has actually also seen improvement because fasting has given me a sense of control in a system where there isn’t much of any. 

I make sure to have some electrolytes/vitamins and water throughout the day when I’m going without calories, black coffee no longer makes my empty stomach upset also which is nice. I also have 5 htp for the serotonin boosting, I’m a half year sober from cannabis by the end of the year :) 

I’ve always had a higher fat composition despite being smaller framed even when I was 88 pounds at my lowest. This feels like it’s helping that paired with workouts. Optimally I’d like to keep my curves and fill them in with more muscle also so I’d like to take my time. I’ve honestly already lost my ass which is wild, it still feels more comfortable to sit than it did growing up when I had a bony ass but I gotta get to getting on my backside strength still.

I met a girl (26f) in my training class who quickly became my “work friend”. We worked for a timeshare company doing virtual sales and both ended up resigning after 6 months due to the draw commission pay structure. It probably goes without saying but selling timeshare was very stressful to maintain after I had been on unemployment for the 6 months prior, and she had just moved back to her home state after a divorce. 

I’m notoriously bad at maintaining friendships. I struggle with my mental health and I actually told her very early on into meeting her that the only friends that I still have are the ones that understand that I may not respond to every message but if we set a time for lunch we can pick up where we left off, even if it’s been years. She said that is fine with her. 

There were many lunch hours at work where she would vent to me about her very recent divorce and apologize for doing so saying “my friends tell me I need to get over it and stop talking about it so much” and I would reassure her that she is always welcome to vent to me about anything and I truly didn’t mind and I would want the same thing if I was in her position. 

After we quit, we both struggled to find a fitting position in todays job market, our friendship fizzled from seeing each other every day at work to attempting to meet up for a movie night or to grab a drink every 4-6 weeks. 

Flash forward to to last night - my partner (30m) of 4 years who I have lived with for 3 years expressed he is not happy in our relationship and unsure if he loves me anymore. The first 3 years of our relationship were perfect. I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. I’m still unsure exactly what caused him to feel this way but he has also been struggling financially this year (real estate agent in a very difficult market) and I think he is unable to separate that stress from our relationship. We agreed to break up. 


I slept 3 hours last night trying to process what had just happened and was supposed to wake up early to take my car that I need to sell into the shop to get new tires and window glass replacement so I can get it sold. My friend texted me out of the blue to ask if “Tuesday still works for our movie night” and I let her know about the breakup. She responded by asking if she could come over in an hour when she was off work and we could go for a drive or grab a sweet treat and I said that sounds really nice but I needed to get everything with my car figured out. 

She showed up an hour later, followed me to the mechanic to drop my car off, then took me to a coffee shop where she insisted on buying my coffee and let me vent everything I was feeling for 2-3 hours. She then drove me back to the mechanic and continued to wait with me in the lobby for another 30 minutes and she knew I planned to take my car to a few different dealerships that are interested in purchasing it tomorrow (Saturday) and said “I’m setting my day aside for you tomorrow. Let me know when I should come over and we can take your car around to see what you can get for it!”

I truly don’t know how to express how much it meant to me that she would just show up for me like that, no hesitation, and go above and beyond to be there for me in a moment that I really needed it… let alone offer to run the worst errands in the world with me??

I feel like my world has been rocked and I have no idea how to take the next steps of figuring out how to separate from me and my partners shared lease/home, etc., but knowing I have someone there for me through it has given me the strength I need to know I can figure it out. I feel like I don’t deserve a friend like her, and today she made me want to be a better friend and show up for people in the same way she did for me.

I did text her to thank her and express how much what she did today meant to me prior to writing this out and she responded: “Of course my honey!! You’ve been there for me through so many breakdowns that’s just what friends do”

You never know when you’re going to meet someone that will show up for you in the moment you need it most.❤️
