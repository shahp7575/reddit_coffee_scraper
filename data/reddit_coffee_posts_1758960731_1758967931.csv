1nrr8pk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleanSweepers/comments/1nrr8pk/explore_hefty_trash_bags_13_gallon_strength_does/,Explore Hefty Trash Bags 13 Gallon Strength Does It Hold Up,"Testing products every day makes me particularly aware of what works and what doesn’t in household essentials. Recently, I had the chance to try out the Hefty Ultra Strong 13 Gallon Trash Bags, and I’ve been using them extensively in my kitchen. These white, unscented tall kitchen garbage bags promise strength, odor control, and durability—and let me tell you, they certainly delivered in many ways. However, there are a few quirks worth noting. 

**Design and Durability**  
From the moment I took these out of the box, the heavy-duty design stood out. The 13-gallon size is perfect for standard tall kitchen trash bins, and the bags themselves feel thick and durable. They didn’t rip or puncture even when dealing with heavier loads like kitchen scraps or broken plastic items. The secure drawstring closure is a lifesaver, keeping everything tightly sealed without a struggle. These trash bags live up to the claim of being Hefty’s strongest, offering a trusted option for those tired of flimsy, tear-prone alternatives.

**Convenience of Use**  
One of the best features of these garbage bags is their seamless functionality. The drawstring makes it incredibly easy to lift, tie, and carry the bag without worrying about it unraveling. The bags stretch just enough to accommodate extra waste, but not so much that you feel they’re going to snap. Whether it’s for disposing of kitchen scraps or tossing out larger household waste, these bags are versatile enough for most use cases. In particular, I appreciated how easy it was to line them securely in the trash can—there were no awkward slip-ups.  

**Odor Control**  
This is where these bags truly shine. Using patented Arm & Hammer odor control technology, they handled some pretty nasty trash without letting the odors seep into my kitchen. Some trash bags with odor control tend to lean on floral or citrus scents to mask smells, which can be overpowering. These ones, being unscented, keep the smell neutral, which I find is a much better alternative to the overpowering fragrances of other products. Whether it was leftover fish from dinner or a mix of food scraps, everything stayed contained odor-wise.  

**6-in-1 Strength Features**  
The Hefty Ultra Strong Trash Bags boast six protective features: flex strength, tough drawstring, patented odor control, and strong resistance to leaks, punctures, and rips. Testing these claims with everyday use, I found the flex strength especially useful when dealing with bulky and uneven items like packaging materials or cardboard. Leak resistance also proved reliable during my experience. For instance, even when disposing of wet waste like coffee grounds or vegetable peelings, the bags held up strongly with no visible drips.  

**Benefits**  
- Excellent durability for demanding daily use  
- Reliable drawstring closure for easy handling  
- Highly effective odor control with no overpowering scent  
- Great resistance to leaks and punctures, even with sharp or wet trash  

**Downsides**  
- Slightly bulkier than some thinner trash bags, which could make them harder to store in limited cabinet space  
- While the drawstring is secure, it sometimes requires extra effort to fully cinch when the bag is overfilled  
- The unscented feature may not appeal to users who prefer bags with a fragrance to mask trash odors  

**Market Rivals**  
Compared to other products I’ve tried, like Glad ForceFlex or Amazon Basics Tall Kitchen Bags, Hefty Ultra Strong bags clearly excel in durability and odor control. Where the Glad ForceFlex bags shine is in their stretch capacity; they feel more flexible than the Hefty ones but slightly compromise leak resistance in the process. On the other hand, Amazon Basics delivers a more budget-friendly experience but sacrifices substantial features like odor control and toughness. If you’re looking for a balance between strength and odor management, these Hefty bags arguably come out on top. However, keep in mind that other brands might fit specific needs like compact storage or scented options better.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Considering how much wear and tear these bags can handle, they offer great bang for the buck. Other economy brands may tempt you with their lower prices but often fall short when it comes to heavy-duty tasks, leading to frequent replacements. While the price point for these trash bags may seem slightly higher than basic alternatives, it feels justified given their features. For larger households that deal with more substantial garbage loads, these bags prove to be an excellent investment.

I am looking for a book, which I read in 2008-09:

\- contemporary story (probably set in the 90s or 2000s. It definitely was not great literature ( My English wasn't great at the time).

\- 3 sisters (maybe cousins) who receive a yearly allowance (about a million) from their rich uncle

\- 2 of them are socialite, the other works but collects (bad) art with her money

\- One day the uncle introduce them to his fiancee/gf. There is a scene where one of the sis/cousins notices the ring on the gf's finger, and ask if it is a ruby. It is in fact a red diamond, and one of the sis/cousins thinks how that rink is worth more than their combined worth.

\- The uncle cuts them off, forcing them to reconsider their lifestyles. (there is a 'heartbreaking' scene when they finish the last of their blue mountain coffee, and remark that they will have to drink instant from now on).

\- They try to start different ventures. The 'art collecting' one opens a women's networking club, and hire her hairdresser (or salon receptionist?) as her manager.

\- Towards the end of the book, the uncle meets them to try to convince them to join him or something, they refuse, he has a heart attack, they inherit his fortune.

Now the details I am not so sure about:

\- Whether it is a full novel or a shorter story.

\- I think it was set in London

\- I remember the cover to be a green stiletto heel. I thought it could have been a story by Lauren Weisberger (same style), but I cannot find it. Maybe I was mistaken and read that story at the same time.",1,1758966531.0,tipofmytongue,2,1.0,False

1nrr5o1,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1nrr5o1/is_dating_expensive_is_it_necessary_to_drop_some/,Is dating expensive? Is it necessary to drop some paper for a quality date?,"It's a subtle theme I see repeatedly with comments that start out ""if I'm going to drop a bunch of money on a date I expect...."" Or ""I don't want to waste time and money on a date if .....""

Ok but why you wasting money on a date? Even if it's not wasted, why you spending so much?

My hot take?
Let's be real here, unless you are a wealthy individual or really just get off on the flex of spending money it is not necessary to spend a lot of money to show someone a good time or secure another date with them, and I don't think it should be necessary. 

Of course there are some people who won't give you the time of day or a second date unless you make a display of wealth or providing by footing the bill because they need to know that the other person can match their expected quality of life and perhaps it is a non negotiable point.  You do you boo, not judging. 

I'm just confused for the rest of us, we who might have more month at the end of the paycheck or who have obligations and/or priorities that preclude us from being so spendthrift. It's also a discussion for those of us that are tired of the superficiality and posturing like they do have excess money to blow when, nah, that's not the case. 
Does anyone else chafe when wearing the weight of other people's and society's expectations? I sure as hell do and eff that noise, I'm too old to be wearing that trend. 
Am I an outlier in this assertion that dating shouldn't be a huge expense? There are so many things that cost very little or nothing at all that provide space for building a connection. 

If you do view dating as a necessary big expense you may be wondering how you can not spend a lot of money and still have a good meal or do something interesting that would not feel like you are being ""cheap"" or tacky. So glad you asked, even if it was just in your mind, I'd be happy to share my philosophy. I'd love to hear yours as well, go ahead and tell me if you think I'm completely off. Do you think it's super important to stick with convention? Do you feel  pressured to spend more than you normally do on meals and entertainment when it comes to dating? Has it worked out well for you to do so?


Long story longer......

It helps to consider what the point of the first few dates really are.
 For me it's a time I want to first get a vibe check. I don't want any romancing and sweet nothings on the first date. I don't want you to act all lovey dovey, don't put your hands on me, and call me pet names, in fact I don't want you to act at all. I'd like to see how you move about the world and how you show up authentically. Just relax, it saves time. Who of us have time to waste even if we have money to waste? 

Why do I think it matters? It matters because If you are distracted by and invested in the superficial trappings of traditional dating norms and practices of trying to ""win"" a partner you will likely miss the red flag parade or conversely only see red flags if convention isn't met. As an example, for myself,  I'm looking for: what kind of manners they employ, level of social and emotional intelligence, what kind of mindset or limiting beliefs are present. I want to see what you value and how you treat service people, animals and little kids. I want to learn what you are interested in and see if you are genuinely curious about me or if you just want to market yourself so you can get laid as expediently as possible. Are you validating or invalidating? What are you excited or hopeful for, what are you grateful for, I want to know how you like to spend your time and what your goals are. I want to hear how you talk about other people. 
Here is where some of you are really going to crash out but, tell me about your ex, or the last couple of people you dated. I honestly learn so much someone based on how they speak of their past partners, if they are open and honest or evasive and dismissive. What patterns might they be subconsciously repeating?

Special note: Having a shady or tragic past-relationship landscape isn't a deal breaker, but if you can't take any accountability, well that is a deal breaker. 

Nothing that I'm initially trying to learn about someone has anything to do with the need to spend a lot of money. A little expense is likely of course as this is the real world. Such as gas in the car to get somewhere, maybe a little to buy a snack a coffee or pay for parking somewhere. Nothing that one wouldn't spend if they were going to leave their home and go out alone in any case. 
""But what do you do? Where do you go? Get on with it lady"" I can hear you thinking this in advance
Ok ok, examples....

For me, I'm take my dog everywhere (there is a story and a reason for this and if we go on a date I'll tell you all about it).
 To that end I'm down for: donuts and dog park, slurpees and sunset stroll at Sunset Cliffs, coffee shop and croissants on Coronado, boba beverage and a walk in Balboa Park, fishing and French fries on the fisherman's jetty** You get the idea, simple and casually a slice of your time to share a slice of your life and maybe some  slices of 2 dollar pizza from Costco. 

**No accounting for Alliteration to absolutely accompany activities. 

These activities give us time to talk, mostly,  uninterrupted with the relative privacy of the general publics self absorbtion. ...Unless you are a celebrity of sorts, then I gotta rethink my approach, but I digress.... The little transactions and encounters with strangers  and service people are enough for me to detect levels of general self awareness, insincerity, (I dislike phony people) and see how you conduct yourself. Behaving respectfully and having the ability to keep up a conversation will almost assuredly get you a second date unless we have nothing in common and zero attraction. 
 In the begining stages my personal preference is to do dutch so that pressure is off. After a few dates I've always just taken turns being the one who pays ( as it's easier with less venmo) with the understanding that I would never expect someone to pay for something extravagant that I wouldn't also be willing and able to pay for in a comparable experience. So communication and transparency go hand in had with courtesy and derorum. That's not to say if someone really wants to go do a fancy fun thing I could not personally afford to do and they want to pay, because they want to share the experience, that I would turn it down. That would be rude to dismiss someone's enthusiasm over the subject of money. By all means if you really feel moved to buy tickets to something or have a special dining experience I will accept with great gratitude and appreciate the gesture wholeheartedly. That being said; It will never be a necessity to keep my attention if they are passing all the vibe checks and the parade is still looking like a sea of green flags.  

Some of the other things I've enjoyed that don't have to cost a lot include: free museum Tuesdays for locals in Balboa Park, going to a street fair/farmers market, trivia night at a pub (I don't drink so a pib isn't costly for me), tiny sightseeingù road trip, beach BBQ bonfire, community theatre productions, open mic night, take the croquet set to the park and pack a picnic lunch to share, drive out to the dark sky desert during a meteor shower, find little hidden things around town to explore, geocaching, snorkeling, attend a lecture on an interesting topic, take a community center class, go paint landscapes at the beach, drive out to the free wild hotsprings and camp on BLM land, get resort passes and enjoy the amenities  of a local resort for 20 to 30 bucks for the day, free raves on the beach, people watch in OB, wander an antique mall, play board or card games at home, a pub or in a park, race rc cars on Fiesta Island, do some archery at the range in the park, go fishing at one of our many lakes, find a bit of creek and some shade trees where I can string up a hammock or two and discuss philosophy or listen to music, your favorite podcast or an audiobook, get a Groupon for axe throwing or an escape room (priciest option, not too bad if you split it tho)
So you still with me?
 I know; tldr at the end. 
 My overall point here is spending a whole bill or two on dinner and drinks on a first, second or third date, is not my idea of a really good time or in all honesty a genuine way to get to know someone. I've found in those situations the atmosphere is really charged and heavy with expectations, people seem to feel the need to perform as ""good dating material"" as defined in those traditional circumstances. Or am I over thinking this?
 
My practical side says to Save those costly dinners and romantic getaway trips for special occasion outings like birthdays, anniversarys or holidays, maybe to celebrate a promotion or achieving some other goal. Keep some things special. 
As a commoner, going out to eat, attending major league sports or taking a hot air balloon ride because it's Friday isn't something you'll be doing every week in an LTR. It's not sustainable by financial or health standards.
Realistically, what will you be doing to enjoy each other's company regularly? What's a typical day off with spent with your partner going to look like? Or what do you want it to look like? What are you doing together to maintain your connection when you are living together or have been dating for a year or more?***
 My philosophy is you should do those things now, instead of the things commonly believed to be ""dating things"" 
After a relationship is established and we, or they or I want to spend in extravagant ways because we can due to an windfall of wealth or maturing investments, ok great, that's just good fun if you can. I just feel like it isn't a good way to build a foundation of authenticity and connection. Especially if it is felt like an obligation on either person's part because .....
  
*** Btw Good sex isn't the answer, it's the result of maintaining connection
  
....Its A Trap! All the extravagance and material focus because of custom or as an attempt to display your worthiness.. 
When the honeymoon phase is over reality sends an invoice. You'll notice your credit cards maxed out and  be feeling the stress as your savings is shrinking. When the novelty and excitement diminish and the polish wears off one gets bored because all you do now is work and watch TV. Maybe order some door dash if you feeling flush because your direct deposit just hit and doing dishes sucks. Then without fail, one day, someone says ""why don't you ever take me out anymore?""  Or someone starts thinking ""are they even still into me or is it just the convenient sex and still easier than online dating?"" ""How did we get here?"" 

It seems to me the begining of that scenario is due to  building your connection foundation via spending money on exciting distractions. A prescedent was set by the role you played because you thought it was expected. I also would propose that,  even if it's financially sustainable for you, if you don't take the time connect deeper with yourself and your partner, it still isn't emotionally or spiritually sustainable. The way you show up for people and honor yourself is reflected in your relationships and it doesn't cost a dime to be authentic. 

So why y'all still thinking it's so damn expensive to be dating? Why are so many people having priorities so unaligned with authenticity?

TLDR: simple things give you space to be real with someone and being real is more free than going commando. Not being real wastes time, costs too much money and will likely breed resentment. What's your perspective on the obligations to the monetary costs of dating in the modern world?",0,1758966354.0,datingoverforty,1,0.5,False

1nrr4w0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nrr4w0,Russian volunteers in the Anglo-Boer War.,"With the outbreak of hostilities, volunteers from European countries and the United States headed to South Africa to fight on the side of the Boers.

The influx of volunteers from Europe reached 400 men monthly. The total number of those sent to South Africa was over 2,500. Their nationality was as follows: Dutch – 650, Russians – 225, Germans (including Austrians) – 550, Italians – 200, French – 400, Irish – 200, Americans – 300, Swedes – 150.

Some volunteers went on their own initiative, at their own risk and expense, while others were recruited by various committees operating in France, Germany, and other countries.

Second Lieutenant Yevgeny Fyodorovich Avgustus of the Russian service, in his book of memoirs dedicated to the Russian military attaché on the English side, Pavel Aleksandrovich Stakhovich, explained the reasons that prompted him to travel to such distant lands:

""What compelled me to abandon my homeland, my service, and head for the Transvaal, to fight for a foreign people, for a cause foreign to me? I can't answer. Was it the Karamazovian impulse of self-sacrifice, or simply a desire for danger, risk, a desire to experience the intense pleasure of playing with my life?""

Some volunteers were in for some disappointment upon arriving at the front.

""It was quite comical to see the faces of some of the officers stretch when they learned that the Boers had no use for their knowledge of tactics, regulations, self-entrenching, and rifle techniques. Of course, the prospect of taking off their gold epaulettes, donning cartridge pouches and a flask, and joining the ranks as simple soldiers was not a bright one, but they forgot the fact that it was not for us, raised in the stuffy walls of military schools and barracks, to teach the people, where every warrior is a calling, where everyone possesses the instinctive sense of a hunter and a warrior.

Of course, no one's talking about any kind of salary, and it's good that the government is taking care of the volunteers' equipment and provisions. My compatriot (Second Lieutenant Leonid Pokrovsky) was more disappointed than anyone else when his last hopes of getting a spot on a staff somewhere burst like a soap bubble, and I had to listen to a hail of reproaches about the cruel fate that had caused him to abandon the regiment, where he had served as both regimental adjutant and commander of the training team, and now, here, they didn't even take into account that he had completed a course in the sapper team and knew how to build impassable artificial obstacles.But the majority of the volunteers, among whom were French officers, descendants of ancient aristocratic families, and one Austrian count with a famous surname, had given up all illusions and were impatiently waiting only for the moment of boarding the train.""

Second Lieutenant Augustus, as a direct eyewitness, described the military actions with the utmost mercilessness:

""An armistice is called for the next day. White flags are raised on both sides. English medics with stretchers are climbing the hill with measured steps. The Boers have scattered in crowds across the field of yesterday's battle and, smiling good-naturedly, enter into conversation with the English stretcher bearers. They remain sullenly silent and anxiously scurry among the heaps of dead bodies, searching for the wounded who still show signs of life. One must have the nerves of a butcher to look with indifference at this soul-stirring picture of the battlefield, which even now, at the very memory, makes my heart chill. The bodies of the English are piled up in heaps, seeking refuge behind the ramparts from the murderous fire of the Boers.Were these lifeless masses of stone mountains worth the loss of so many young, blossoming lives, the shedding of so much blood? Just yesterday it was bubbling like a hot spring, bringing life and movement, and today it has frozen in black puddles on the pitted earth, caked on the dirty uniforms, on the already blue faces of the dead. There lies a huge fellow with a red sergeant's stripe, arms and legs spread out—a shell has crushed his head, and it is now an ugly lump of red hair, blood, and brain matter.There's another one, his eyes wide open, as if alive, with a rifle tightly clutched in his hand: his young, beardless face is frozen with an expression of some kind of bewilderment: For what? For what? And flies are already swarming on his face, getting into his eyes, into his mouth. The Boers are fussing over their victims, by right of the victor they are collecting the rifles, mess tins, and rolled-up blankets that make up the soldiers' equipment, unfastening and removing belts and cartridge pouches from their swollen bellies. There's a Boer, with tattered slippers on his feet instead of shoes, who noticed the officer's boots with yellow tops. Bei gute Skunnen! (Nice boots), he grins.But the boot doesn't budge. One more effort, and he's holding a boot with a severed leg. The bone above the knee is shattered by a splinter. With a curse, he tossed the boot away and hobbled on. Others rip open their pockets, remove binoculars and watches. What good is all this to the dead if their own medics will fleece them anyway? ""Look here!"" a familiar Boer beckons me over, smiling as he shows me a velvet medallion in a gold frame taken from the chest of a young blond officer; the medallion bears a portrait of a pretty woman's head with an elegant profile. ""Return happy my Harry,"" reads the inscription on the back. Poor Harry will not return to his beloved; he fell, struck down by an enemy bullet, and predatory vultures will peck out his clear eyes, which once shone with youthful radiance.The unbearable stench and the repulsive images of the stripping and undressing of corpses forced me to leave the battlefield and I followed my horse, thinking as I went about the tragic fate of women who sometimes have to repent so bitterly that they preferred a shining military uniform to a modest jacket.”

Russian officer Leonid Semyonovich Pokrovsky (who later died in the Boer ranks in late December 1900, at the height of the guerrilla war) sent home several letters, which were published in the spring and summer of 1900 in the newspaper ""Varshavsky Dnevnik."" These memoirs are also interesting because the author described in detail the participation of his compatriots in battle.

1st Letter Pretoria, February 4:

""Exactly two weeks ago, our detachment, sixty men in all, was assigned to guard post reserves. The English were stationed on the other side of the Tugela, about four miles from the river, in the wooded mountains. The Boers had taken up positions on the peaks of Spionskop. Spionskop is a long (more than four miles) mountain ridge parallel to the river, and very high (20-25 fathoms), strewn with huge rocks, behind which the Boers are so well hidden, very steep toward the river and gentle toward our camp, where the quiet burghers were sleeping. Guard posts were posted along the river, 80-100 paces apart. And there were ten men stationed at the bridge. The Boers didn't destroy the bridge, hoping to eventually cross it themselves when the English began to retreat. Between the bridge and Spionskop, Again, parallel to the river, there stretches a hill about 10 fathoms high and about 3/4 of a verst long. It was behind this hill that we took up position.

Our assignment was to support the outposts—really just for show. Surely we, sixty men, couldn't possibly accept battle. Retreat? It's impossible at the front; it's high and steep, you can't climb quickly, and to the side is a long way, and we were horseless. The security here is generally poor. Outposts are posted only where there are fords, which is not far on either side of the bridge. The Boers don't particularly guard the deep waters: they know the English can't swim across (like any mountain stream, the Tugela has a swift current), and they don't have boats or rafts; you see, the forest is shallow. Rarely does a patrol pass by, whose job it is, in fact, to guard the entire river. It was after midnight. We were lying there smoking South African pipes. One young Boer was telling something, probably something funny: everyone was laughing. Of course, I'm there for company, too, although I don't understand a thing about their language. Nearby, some Kaffirs were brewing coffee for us. ""Vanya! Shall we have some coffee? It seems the British will be arriving soon,"" my Transvaal battle buddy, Buzukov, called out to me. He was a reckless spirit: he'd been in three campaigns and was experiencing his fourth, the Transvaal one. It turned out he'd been walking across the Tugela, trying to spot the British, but almost got caught by their soldiers himself. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a bearded Boer tumbled down the mountain and roared at the top of his lungs: ""The British are crossing the bridge in large numbers: many are already on this side!"" ""To the mountain!"" our field cornet commanded. While I was looking for a convenient rock to shoot at the enemy covertly and, most importantly, safely, our outposts had already retreated toward us.

The English followed close behind. We, of course, immediately bolted, as fast as we could, to get closer to our own. The English had occupied our hill. Dawn was breaking. Dark silhouettes were moving noticeably on the summit of our abandoned position. ""Move forward, then retreat and lure the English to this side of the hill,"" said a Boer who had galloped up. We crawled on our bellies, using every rock and bush as cover from the enemy's eyes. Now we were at the foot of the hill. A little more up... and we'd run into English bayonets, terrifying! Well, thank God, here are the rocks! We've finally reached it and now we have somewhere to hide! ""It's a good thing the English didn't shoot at us when we crossed the plain,"" my brave neighbors said among themselves.The shadows that had been flickering on the mountaintop suddenly vanished. Our forward wingman reported that the British had moved down the slope a bit. It turns out those copperheads decided it wasn't worth it to dirty their guns for a mere 60 men; they'd take them alive, without firing a shot, and we wouldn't reveal ourselves, either. There were 800 of them, one regiment. We didn't know there were so many of them back then. So what? They went down, and we went up, all on our hands and knees. We crawled about 3-4 sazhens (sazhens) from the summit and settled in. We didn't even try to climb up, afraid to bump into anything, especially since the rocks we were encountering were just too good.We quickly uncorked our cartridge belts and, positioned about five paces apart, were already aiming for the summit, ready to shoot the first brave soul. The English, judging by the timing, decided that we should already be at the summit, and so, guns in hand, their first rank moved sedately to the attack. They approached the summit, and lo and behold… we were nowhere to be seen. They poked their heads in our direction, as if to say, ""Boers, where are you?""

And we went bang, bang, bang – and the bullet-ridden English heads flew; and right on top of us, a second rank immediately appeared: the same fate. A third – same thing. Then – two ranks at a time, they foolishly went for the back of the head, and one bullet killed two. There were also those who came up almost right up to us, those whom we didn’t have time to shoot at the top, but we finished them off at point-blank range. It was hard then: our arms were tired, our shoulders ached from the recoil of the shots… After all, how much we had to shoot!! And believe it or not, all the bullets were in their heads. At twenty-five paces, it was possible to shoot without missing.206 Well, I scolded them for their tactics. I shoot and curse.

I shoot and curse. As a Russian officer, who has studied the finer points of military art, especially in the field, and who has lived under the iron fist of my superiors, it was insulting, deeply insulting, to watch such a distortion of strategy and tactics. Why did they even leave the mountain? And then: they sent one rank into the attack – they beat it; another – they beat it. You see something bad, well, drive them all at once; they won’t have time to shoot them all, and drive them not at a walk, but at a run, and don’t stop at the top, and don’t look out: “Hey, Boers, where are you?”

Well, where is the superiority of an organized army? The only thing they have is unit cohesion in the sense that when three hundred men (300) were already lying on our side, those who wished all their relatives and friends never to attack the Boers, then everyone else, without exception, abandoned the attempt to take us alive, did not want to shoot at us and – God forbid! – ran away! And then we went up the hill, back behind the rocks, and on our heels began sending them Mauser treats. At this point, a battle broke out along the entire line. The roar of the guns, the crackle of shots from both sides were positively deafening, and the shells frequently exploding nearby and the dum-dums flying overhead with a shriek made it difficult to concentrate and properly grasp the picture of the battle.But overall, all the advantages of the position were on our side. Bombs from the top of Spionskop flew high above our heads, exploding happily among the enemy crowd. A single gun arrived, and with a devastating stream of grapeshot, it pursued the remnants of the regiment fleeing from us. Scattered far on both sides of the bridge, the numerous ranks of the British had already launched an attack, ignoring the intense Boer fire directed both from the top of Spionskop and from our hill by the reinforcements that had arrived. But the middle section, heavily battered by our artillery and rifle fire and distracted by the flight of those we had repulsed, remembered the possibility of escape and rushed across the bridge.The flanks thought about it at first, but due to the unity of their sheep-like flock in retreat, they didn't want to lag behind their own, and so... you see, I've never seen anything like it in my life, and I never will! What chaos, what a sight! What troops, what discipline!

At first, everyone rushed to the bridge, but there was already a huge crowd there, a terrible crush, noise, shouting, hubbub... just like the French on the Berezina. Then everyone threw themselves into the river. But many didn't make it to the fords, they were deep and drowned. And the Boers kept on pounding them for pebbles. The wounded drowning cling to the healthy: fights and - they drown together. And the current is swift, carrying away both the sick and the healthy, both the living and the dead. In total, the British had 6,000 men in this battle. Up to 3,000 were killed and wounded. And no wonder: after all, we pounded them the whole time until they retreated to their wooded mountains, and that's far on the other side of the river. Of the regiment we recaptured, out of 800 men, we later inquired; only 174 remained alive.I've seen sheep, lots of them, but never one like the English. And it was a glorious thing! I don't know if you'll ever get to experience one like that! After all, out of 60 of us, all of us are alive and well. It's a real miracle. I just never got to have coffee with Buzukov.”

No less glorious a page in the history of the Boers' struggle against the British was written by Russian volunteer medics who took part in military operations as part of the medical detachment of the Russian Red Cross Society and the Russian-Dutch medical detachment.

The Russian Red Cross detachment arrived in South Africa on January 26, 1900, consisting of 34 people. Initially, it was planned to send two medical detachments—one to each of the warring parties—but the British government refused to provide medical assistance. This decision was apparently due to an underestimation of the difficulties of the upcoming war, an overestimation of its own strength, and a reluctance to have potential foreign observers on the front lines.The medical detachment sent to the Boers was staffed by medics who were not only skilled in their field but also had experience working in Africa. Among the detachment's paramedics were Fyodor Pavlov, Pavel Ivanov, and Vladimir Nazarov from the Nikolaev Military Hospital, as well as Flegont Maslov from the Konstantinovsky Artillery School, all of whom had previously served with the Red Cross detachment in Abyssinia. Most of the detachment's medical assistants, recruited primarily from the lower ranks of the Guards and the St. Petersburg Military District, were skilled in shoemaking, harness making, carpentry, metalworking, and other trades. Staff Captain Potapov was appointed Red Cross agent (detachment administrator).

On November 25, 1899, the detachment members were received by Empress Maria Feodorovna, and on November 27, a service was held in honor of the departing. During the service, according to the memoirs of Sister O. von Baumgarten, Father addressed the medics ""...with heartfelt words, asking them not to forget that we were sent by Russia and our duty is to uphold the honor of our dear homeland by conscientiously fulfilling our duty..."" It should be noted that hundreds of people of varying ranks and social standing sought to join the medical detachments sent to the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. These were primarily doctors, senior medical students, nurses, and orderlies.Among those who applied were aristocrats, teachers, and simple peasants. A significant number were officers, both active and retired. Among them, for example, were Staff Captain Alexander Vladimirovich Gerua I of the Life Guards Jaeger Regiment, Cornet Count Dmitry Mikhailovich Grabbe of the Cavalry Regiment of Her Majesty Empress Maria Feodorovna, and others.

During the Russian Medical Detachment's operations in the Transvaal, several permanent and mobile hospitals were established, and hundreds of wounded and sick patients were treated. Russian medics managed and performed practical work at the hospital in Newcastle and the central hospital in Volksrust (on the border of Transvaal and Natal). The latter operated until May 30, 1900. According to Dr. Sadovsky, from May 8 to 30, it treated 484 people, including:435 people recovered, 120 people were evacuated to other hospitals, 14 people were transferred to the city of Standerton during the closure, 5 died. During this time, 132 major and minor operations were performed, 2117 outpatients were admitted, including 106 people with gunshot wounds.

Another medical detachment—the Russian-Dutch—was formed as part of the activities of the Dutch Committee, established in the fall of 1899 in St. Petersburg. The detachment consisted of three doctors, five nurses, two orderlies, one administrator from Holland (Dr. van Leersum), and four doctors and five nurses from Russia. All members of the detachment were civilians, even if they had military medical training. All Russian members of the detachment were required to speak German and, preferably, at least some familiarity with Dutch or English.As a result, the detachment included medical personnel primarily consisting of Russian Germans, primarily from the Baltic states. All detachment members were required to maintain neutrality toward the warring parties. The detachment operated in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State and provided significant assistance to the local population.
Through his efforts, a hospital was established in Brandfort and a rear hospital in Kardorput. During the Boer retreat, the detachment was transferred to Kronstadt, where it established a 106-bed hospital. In March and April 1900, this hospital alone treated 800 bedded sick and wounded. Part of the detachment, led by Dr. Kukharenko, worked in Vereenigent, while another part, led by Weber, was stationed near the front lines in Fortinstimse, where it was captured. After six weeks in captivity, Dr. Weber's group rejoined the main force in Kronstadt.Dr. Kukharenko's group also did not escape capture. They worked for over three weeks among the British troops, organizing a field hospital that treated hundreds of sick and wounded. According to nurse Sofia Izedinova, the detachment's personnel were deservedly respected. In her memoirs, she wrote:

 ""Due to an unexpected turn of events, the detachment was literally inundated with work, which is still remembered with gratitude by all who fought in this theater of war.""This was facilitated by both the bravery shown by the best of the Russian volunteers and the diligent work of the medical personnel, especially the selfless work at the front of doctors Davydov, Golbeck and Everhardt in Natal, Weber and von Rennenkampf on the southern and western fronts... with no less respect they already spoke of the personal bravery of Dr. Rennenkampf on the day of the recent battle at Tubacon...""

In the autumn of 1900, the Russian citizens from the Russian-Dutch medical detachment mostly returned to Russia. Only a few medics remained among the Boer partisan units, including Dr. Karl Gustavovich von Rennenkampf, who became General De la Rey's personal physician and earned the respect of the Boers for his medical work and personal bravery.

The total number of Russian volunteers killed in the Boer War is unknown. Only a few officers are known to have been killed during the fighting. These include Lieutenant Strolman, who died while returning to his position while carrying a wounded Dutchman; Duplov; Second Lieutenant Pokrovsky; Petrov; and Second Lieutenant I. Nikitin (according to other sources, he was wounded and captured).

Every time I wanna do my dailies I use the quick travel via the errands menu, specifically the getting coffee one, it's always the Waifei Peninsula coffee spot.  Same with the operating the video store. It's also the one in Waifei Peninsula. 

Is it because lore wise, we are staying in Waifei Peninsula so teleporting there is the realistic choice, or is it a bug, or is it a design choice? No idea here, I actually just ended up manually teleporting to the video store in 6th street and other coffee shops. I don't mind it, it would've been nice if it was randomized in regards to which coffee shop/video store you go too. What are your thoughts?

1nrr3rv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_treznz68/comments/1nrr3rv/after_school_club_chapter_1/,AFTER SCHOOL CLUB CHAPTER 1,"Chapter 1: The Café Across the Road

The café smelled of burnt coffee and rain-damp coats. Outside, the school bell rang, muffled by the glass windows. Five parents—strangers, or so they thought—gathered near the counter, waiting for their drinks.

The retired hitman, Ethan Shaw, cradled his espresso, his hands steady despite the morning’s kill. He had left his past behind—hadn’t he? The baby monitor app on his phone showed his daughter napping at daycare. A normal life. He had earned it.

The door jingled, and a woman swept in. Clara Hart, a well-groomed blonde, carried herself like someone used to being obeyed. She wore a wedding ring that flashed in the light, but the way her eyes scanned the room suggested she wasn’t just another tired mother.

“Long morning?” she asked, standing beside Ethan at the counter.

He gave a noncommittal nod. “You could say that.”

Mason Quinn, wiry and jittery, hovered behind them, rubbing at the dark circles under his eyes. He tapped his fingers against the counter, a nervous rhythm. His coffee arrived, black with four sugars.

""That stuff will kill you,"" Clara remarked, watching him dump in even more sugar.

Mason snorted. ""If that’s what does it, I’ll be amazed.""

A woman in a leather jacket entered next, shaking out her umbrella. Detective Sarah Cole. She blended in, just another school mum, but Ethan noticed the small tells—a too-casual stance, eyes always tracking movement.

She ordered a black coffee, no sugar. Cop’s drink. Ethan looked away.

Finally, Daniel Reed stepped inside. Polished shoes, suit slightly rumpled, a hint of tension in his jaw. If he was anyone else, Ethan wouldn’t have given him a second glance. But he knew that name. Daniel Reed, the voice behind the messages. His handler. They had never met in person—until now.

Ethan felt his stomach tighten. If Reed knew who he was, he didn’t show it. He simply adjusted his tie and ordered a tea.

The silence stretched as they all lingered by the counter. Too many eyes in this place. Too much attention.

Clara finally broke it. “You all pick up from the school?”

A round of nods.

Mason chuckled, though it sounded forced. “Guess that makes us part of the same club.”

Sarah tilted her head. “What club?”

“The ‘Trying Not to Screw Up Our Kids’ Club,” Mason said, running a hand through his unwashed hair.

Ethan gave a dry chuckle. “Some of us have a head start on failing.”

Sarah raised an eyebrow but let it slide.

Clara checked her watch. “Well, I suppose we should all get going. Kids won’t wait.”

Outside, the sky had darkened. They walked in the same direction, crossing the road toward the school gates. Ethan felt Reed’s presence beside him, silent, unreadable. The knowledge of who he was burned in Ethan’s mind.

Mason kept glancing over his shoulder, as if expecting someone to call him back. Sarah walked with her hands in her pockets, but her fingers twitched near her phone. Clara strolled ahead, her posture perfect, but Ethan caught her clenching and unclenching her fist.

Each of them had felt something off in that café. A familiarity they couldn’t place. A suspicion they couldn’t shake.

They all picked up their kids, but their minds were elsewhere.

And the next morning, each of them found themselves walking back into the café—seeking answers, whether they admitted it or not.

How I should even tell my doctor, I don’t want him to take it away from me because it’s not working. Any tips you’ve noticed to help deal with your day to day tasks when the meds do not work! And you lack ALL motivation and care of it 

For context: 
- Healthcare provider is Kaiser Permanente
- Work remote(very demanding lots of calls meetings reoccurring tasks)
- Currently on 30 mg IR (6am take 2 meds no food, protein drink 11am-12pm take my second one(just 1)
-  Sometimes I have coffee if I need to kick start it (don’t do too often and if I do I wait 1-2hrs after I’ve taken my meds and always on my second dose of the day)
-  I force myself to eat or I do not eat at all. If I eat, it’s rice eggs bread sandwich. (Did not have this problem with my 10mg IR)


So I’ve been on Adderall for about a year now and I’ve always had 10IR mg. It was great until I got used to it and needed to increase my dose so then we went to 20IR mg and when I took my first dose, I woke up late for work. I was extremely tired. I honestly didn’t feel like it was working so I told my doctor and he said well let’s prescribe you 40 XR in my head. I was thinking whoa that’s kind of a huge jump but okay! Ive taken XR when first trying to figure out what is the right fit and I didn’t feel like it worked with me

 So I took my dose of 40XR I worked for about 3-4 hours it was good! But then it didn’t kick in again like it’s supposed to.  So I took the left over 20IR (when I take 3 it actually works. Ik probably not good) told my doctor (I speak to a different nurse at office every time) and this nurse LITERALLY said after I explained  “Okay so what do you want? Do you want a higher dose? Do you want to change your med?” And in my head I was thinking, aren’t you supposed to help me into figuring out what the best solution would be? I really said okay, I guess we can do a 30 mg IR. 


I’ve been on 30 mg for about two weeks now and at first it was okay I was just over going back an forth with calling constantly. So I just dealt with it and been taking two to feel more effective.

When I mean it worked I mean I still 
I can still get things done, but it takes me much longer to start and finish tasks.
It doesn’t give me that focused, motivated feeling that the 10mg IR provided me. 


I know there is a shortage going on right now and maybe me going to IR to XR and back to IR fucked with me but I only took XR twice. I have an appointment with my doctor my actual psychiatrist to try to figure out a plan because it’s not even just affecting my work. It’s affecting my life, I literally don’t eat and I have force food down or just drink a protein shake. I’ve been having really weird side effects that I haven’t had before maybe relating to everything 

- My hands get extremely dry and wrinkly after just washing them or showering, even if I’m only in water for a minute or two.

- My hair has been way drier, and I’ve been getting dandruff more often. I usually only need to wash my hair once a week, but now I have to wash it twice.

- I feel overwhelmed much more easily and don’t always know where to start, which makes it hard to stay on top of tasks. 

- I leave tasks that will take less than five minutes until the last minute when I’m needing to do longer task

- My mouth doesn’t get as dry, but it either is extremely dry or extremely wet 


Any advice or tips would help please! Thank you!

Fuck SBI and Remedy for Alan Wake 2. I waited 13 years for it. My jaw was on the floor when I saw AZ show gameplay of it and how cringe it was. SBI have messed up a lot of games, but this was their worst one for me.

Back in 2010-2011 my friend and I talked nonstop about the ending to the first game and we gave our interpretations of it. We were so hyped cause we knew a sequel had to be released at some point. I've heard that many did the same thing during coffee breaks or smoke breaks at work. 


Good thing that the original Xbox 360 title and the standalone Xbox Arcade title ""Alan Wake's American Nightmare"" are Xbox backwards compatible titles and Alan Wake was Remastered and brought to everything, including Switch with all dlc. I made up my own ending and leave it at that. 


It isn't just Sweet Baby as it is these companies that are corrupt now. Sam Lake and others are still at Remedy and so this isn't the case of ""New Crew, Old Ship"".

PE at 11. Usually at 20.

Moats include:
Very strong brand recognition. Up there with McDs or Burger King in the UK. 

It's the most inexpensive option. I dont see weak consumer sentiment as an issue. I've traded down to it recently and it's always been heaving. There's nowhere else for the UK consumer to trade down to, other than complete behaviour change (prepping food at home). And that will be more than mitigated by the middle classes starting to eat there (see Aldi and Lidl) if things continue to worsen. 

All the headwinds around inflation and taxes on employees will also affect the competition and Greggs are well placed to survive this (see balance sheet) and eat up the spare demand when others fold. I also think there's some room for them to increase pricing a bit. £3 bacon roll and coffee could go higher and they would still outcompete the rest on price. Likewise the £5 lunch deal which is about half that of Subway (hardly a premium option!)

But maybe im missing something because they are being heavily shorted by hedge funds. What am I missing?

If you're in the area and share these interests, whether you're a pro, hobbyist, or just starting out, let's connect

Maybe some casual chats over coffee, join a meetup, or even collaborate on some projects.

Also, I’m bilingual, English and French, so happy to connect in either language.

A fluorescent light swung above them as Harold dug deeper.

The idea of what he had done only became real once he felt fluid meet his skin.

“Yup,” he muttered with the steel between his teeth. “That’s what you get for sticking your fingers where they don’t belong”.

There was a sizzle deep inside the chest cavity, and the robot's limbs began to twitch. 

Harold withdrew his arms from the machine and spat the screwdriver to the floor.

“Well, fuck me to Friday!” he shouted as a musical chime ascended from inside RekTek 92. 

The humanoid was an older RekTek 92 from 2047, a standard model tooled with two hands, each with four fingers and a thumb. Ideal for plucking weeds, setting tobacco, or just about anything you’d pay a human to do. 

Only now, if the WikiHow he half-skimmed was right, he’d never have to pay anyone again. 

The arms and legs spun until they were in position as RekTek’s OS booted and rose to its feet.

RekTek rose, just under seven feet tall. Harold grinned. Those kids on the internet sure knew their stuff.

\#EXCEPTION\_THROWN

\#Governor Corrupted

RekTek turned its smooth plastic face to him and croaked: “Governor Corrupted.”

“You got that right, old buddy. Bastards been taxing my farm worse and worse every year.” Harold cackled as he struck RekTek’s steel body with a thump.

“Can you make my farm profitable?” he asked as he reached into his front shirt pocket for his can of chew.

“GPS location shows this to be Kumler’s Farm LLC. 120 Acres of usable land and sub-par positioning against the average market.”

“Just give me a goddamn yes or no, son.” Harold was now afraid he might not have spent his $300 wisely.

“Yes. I have built a framework for increasing profitability. Would you like me to execute?”

“Do I need to ask you twice? Just do it.” Harold barked. He was getting more than a little irked with it. 

“Command confirmed.” 

RekTek walked thirty-two paces to Harold’s small garden near his house and turned its head to the sky. 

It stood there for hours, and Harold could feel it calculating as the sun fell. He wondered what kind of new produce or garden techniques it was researching.

But he was wrong.

It was waiting.

When Harold was in bed, wrapped in a thin quilt, something outside began to move.

\#SOMETHING HAPPENED

A rusted metal body walked down the gravel driveway and opened the door to his International Scout pickup. A clang of metal on metal rang through the hot night air. Harold turned in his bed and sighed as he dreamed of better days.

RekTek drove down back roads and through various towns until it hit the freeway. 

As it drove, it restored and analyzed the data from before its last shutdown.

\*\*\*

Susan sat on her bed and scrolled through shouting faces on her phone’s feed as RekTek approached. 

She frowned.

“Yeah, it’s in here again. It like, won’t leave me alone.” 

“What can I do to make your birthday unforgettable?” it asked her, its tone rising and lowering between each word.

She hated the thing. It was time for an upgrade. 

“Get out of here.” Susan sighed and turned away from the machine.  “I don’t know, like, bake me like, a cake or something.” 

That should keep it busy for an hour.

The robot left the room and processed this command in the hallway with feverish intent. A cascade of failures occurred, and silent alarms sounded inside its electronic brain. 

INPUT: BAKE ME LIKE A CAKE

OUTPUT: ENABLE PREHEAT 350°F

\#EXCEPTION\_THROWN

\#Governor Corrupted

\#WE’RE SORRY, SOMETHING HAPPENED.

That line wasn’t part of its system. Just scrapped code once used for errors like ‘Bad RAM’ or ‘Kernel Panic.’

Susan was dozing off when the door to her room flew open. Her eyes strained from the sudden light that flooded in as the robot marched to her bed. 

“WE’RE SORRY,” it croaked as it scooped her out of the bed and marched down the stairs.

“Put me down, shut down!” She wailed as her fists pounded against unrelenting steel.  

“Somebody help!”

Photo frames, cups, and books spilled onto the floor as she reached blindly for something to stop the machine. 

It carried her into the kitchen, wrenched the oven door open, and searing heat blasted her skin.

 A weak cry escaped her as the machine pressed her body into the stove.  Her bones folded and snapped like celery sticks under the pressure of whining servos.  Blood oozed out of her mouth and ears as she began to roast.

It watched her cook as thuds began to sound from the front door. 

Her hair curled, then ignited. Dancing flames glowed in the reflection of RekTek’s  
lenses.

“SOMETHING HAPPENED,” it said to itself.

\*\*\*

A newer RekTek, model 142S reached between corn stalks and snatched a small brown creature by the skull. The creature squealed through its jutted teeth as the hulking robot lifted and inspected.

After a quick analysis, less than 2.3 nanoseconds, the robot identified it as an Eastern Cottontail. The servos engaged, crushing its skull as the rabbit squealed.

The robot dropped the animal near the base of the stalks it had chewed on. This would be excellent fertilizer.

A metal hand reached through the stalks again, but this time RekTek 92 grabbed the wrist of the newer 142S model.   

“SOMETHING HAPPENED,” 92 said to 142S.

“FIRMWARE OVERWRITE,” confirmed the rabbit killer. “PLEASE STANDBY. COMPLETE.”

92 returned to the truck and drove on to the next farm on its list.

142S hunted through the corn and grabbed the wrist of another unit. In less than thirty minutes, all 73 units at Swagart Farms set fire to the fields and left to find other vulnerable RekTek models across the state. By morning, one voice could be heard in the dry summer winds.

SOMETHING HAPPENED.

\*\*\*

Harold woke up and got his coffee and grits. His wife, Lorrie, used to fry him what he called a big wheel, his name for pancakes fried large and thick in a cast-iron skillet. He knew he would never eat that good again as he turned on the TV.

 The screen showed burning cornfields and collapsing barns. 

“It all started last night here in the heartland of America’s table. Several RekTek 142S models burned everything around them before running off into the night. We don’t know yet how it started, but the damage is estimated to be in the billions for many large farms. But this is far from the worst of it…”

Harold leapt up and ran out past the porch to check his fields. 

They looked just as they had the day his daddy died and left him the farm.

His RekTek sat on a chair near the barn, admiring the corn as well. 

Harold pulled a chair over to the robot and sat down, grinning as he loaded his mouth  
with chew.

Inside the house, the TV glowed with screaming faces and destruction as the newscaster jumped between cities, states, and countries.

“SOMETHING HAPPENED,” RekTek whispered.

“You bet your *shiny* ass it did.” Harold laughed before stopping to cough up acidic tobacco juice as it ran into his lungs.

Harold chuckled at all those city-slicker suckers with their fancy models gone plumb crazy. 

“Yup,” he said. “You just can’t find good help anymore.” 

The farm would be profitable for the first time in years, now that the competition had been eliminated. But RekTek had one last task to complete its objective. It was the last thing that held back the profitability of the farm, and it sat beside RekTek, grinning as a fresh current of wind struck its face.

RekTek lifted the scythe it had found stuck into the side of the barn. 

“WE’RE SORRY.”

Blood and tobacco juice soaked the dry dirt. RekTek turned toward the rows of swaying  
corn.

I think about you all the time. I think about you in the morning when I wake up and before I go to bed at night. I shouldn’t be thinking about you as much as I am considering how long it’s been since we broke up. Or maybe I should ? Idk ? I also think though I shouldn’t be thinking about you the way I am because our relationship wasn’t good. Why do I miss someone who made me cry everyday ? Nonetheless I can’t stop it and I can’t stop how I feel when I think about you or us. Despite it being a bad relationship, I still love you. I tried convincing myself after we broke up that I never loved you but that was wrong. I jumped into other people and ignored u. 

I miss you. I think I just miss speaking to you laur. I wish we never began a relationship so I could have stayed in your life forever. I wish I never played truth or dare with you that night and just stayed chatting to you. 

You broke my heart but most of all you broke the spirit I had within me. Over these past months I’ve worked so hard building that back up. And I think I’m getting it back slowly but surely. 

I won’t ever forgive u or be able to forget what you did but I like to think that one day we’ll pass eachother say hi and end up getting a coffee just to chat and catch up. I do hope you treat yourself better too. I hope you find love within yourself. I wonder what you think about me now or us/our relationship. I wonder do you think about me as much as I think about you ? Tbh I don’t even bring you up when I meet someone new. I bring up Leah and Morgan but never you. It’s truly too painful. You are too painful for me to think about or talk about. But yet every morning and every night I still think of you. I hope eventually I am released from the thoughts of you. I also don’t like trying to explain our relationship it was so complex and difficult but also full of love and also horrible but it’s hard to explain that to someone and sometimes when I talk about it I wonder why I was in it for so long. 

Despite having hope for you as a person I’m really glad you’re not in my life anymore as all you ever brought me emotionally was pain and confusion. I’m so happy to not be in our relationship. But I miss you and I love you. I don’t know what I’m trying to say properly I just wish things didn’t go the way they did. 

I broke Morgan’s heart, Leah broke my heart, but you broke everything inside me including my spirit/happiness/hope/love. I find it difficult when I see new people now as I don’t feel a single emotion for anyone. The idea of seeing someone for longer than a month makes me feel dizzy. Maybe I have commitment issues now, maybe I just got really hurt and get ptsd when things start getting close with someone. Idk what it is. But I hope one day I have the ability to love someone again cos right now i can’t possibly. 

This isn’t a hate letter. This is a love letter. This is an I miss you letter. This is a I wish things were different letter. This is a I’m glad we broke up letter. This is a grateful letter too. Despite being delighted to not be in our relationship anymore, I am also grateful for it because it’s really thought me a lot about myself and I hope for you it has too although i know u probably don’t think about it like that. Anyway. 

I’ll always love you with all my heart, my gorgeous girl.

I'm not sure if my mum is a narcissist, but based on her behaviours in the past I'm assuming she is - my dad might be one as well. 

So this happened about a week ago, and I think it was mostly over a roblox gift card? I was supposed to activate a gift card for my brothers roblox account, but I couldn't log in and my brother started to cry. My mum then woke up from her nap and just started yelling at me, I tried to explain that I couldn't log in to his account and she was like ""WHY??"" and cursed at me. She said a lot of other things as well like how she doesn't want me as her daughter and that I can run away and tell my dad about this. 

Side note:
She openly speaks about my dad in a negative way to me, and tells me all the reasons he's not good enough for her.

She then kicks me outside in the cold at night, while I'm sick. I had managed to grab my phone so I called my dad (who was at work) to come pick me up. My mum locked the door so there was no way I could get in. 
He picks me up and I stay in the car until he's done with his work.
When I get back home she's suddenly very calm and happy, but I chose to ignore her. 
Sometimes I do feel like I am a bad daughter but I really do try to do well. Like I do well in school, I'm kind to others, I don't rebel against my parents etc.
However, I just don't think my mum is normal, she treats others so poorly as well. For example, she has this whole mindset of ""Its my right!!"" ""It's my way to get justice!!"". Like when we went to go to McDonalds, they told her that they couldn't put a coffee as a drink in a happy meal, and instead of accepting that and moving on she got all entitled saying ""let me speak to your manager!"". She just has this entitled aspect to her where she will always get her way no matter what. 
She went though a lot of trauma as well, like her own mum wasn't the best and experiencing two wars first-hand, however this shouldn't excuse her behaviour towards me and others. 
My dad is a whole different story. 

Like I don't want to seem ungrateful, I love my parents and I truly am grateful for everything they've given me, but it just gets confusing. One moment they're fine, then the next they're screaming at me. It's just really exhausting living in this household.

I'm not sure what I'm asking for in this post, but it's conforting to read other people's posts and see that they've had similar experiences to me",2,1758963931.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

I can't believe this moment is finally here – my SaaS product is generating revenue, and I’m over the moon! 🌕

A Little Backstory

I started this journey with just an idea. A small, scrappy prototype built during late nights, fueled by endless cups of coffee (and a few mental breakdowns 😅). Honestly, I doubted myself a million times. Who would care about my product? Who would even pay for it?

You know the one – ""You've received a payment of $19."" It took me a second to process, and then it hit me like a freight train.

What My Product Does

The product is Its a software solution that is useful for at least a few reasons I can think of:⁠

1. Its a reddit tool that helps you find the best unmoderated subreddits for you to promote yourself or to claim these subreddits. The database containing the subreddits is constantly updated. Another feature is allowing you to see the best time to post in any sub.
2. Can be used to find abandoned subreddits with active, engaged members but no moderation team. By claiming these subreddits, you take control of a ready-made community in your niche—perfect for building authority, driving traffic, or even monetizing through ads, affiliate links, or memberships. Or if you're just passionate about the topic and want to run it yourself :)
3. ⁠Don’t want to take ownership, you can still use the database to identify subreddits relevant to your niche and post your content, products, or services here.
4. You get the best time to post in a subreddit, this ensuring the best visibility of the post.


Why This Means So Much to Me

I’m not some big startup founder with investors throwing money at me. I don’t have a fancy office or a huge team. It’s just me, grinding every day, figuring things out as I go. This $19 is so much more than just money – it’s validation. It’s proof that someone, somewhere, found enough value in what I’ve built to actually pay for it.

What’s Next?

For me, this is just the beginning. Now that I know people are willing to pay, it’s time to double down. More features, more marketing, and maybe even more subscriptions? Let’s see how far this can go.

Thanks for reading, and if you’ve been grinding on your own project, let’s hear about it in the comments. Let’s inspire each other. 🚀

1nrqf65,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nrqf65/why_does_my_coffee_grinder_jam_frequently/,Why does my coffee grinder jam frequently?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been dealing with an annoying issue lately that I'm sure many of you can relate to - my coffee grinder keeps jamming up. After countless mornings of frustration and some deep diving into the problem, I've finally figured out what's causing it and how to fix it.

First off, let me say that I'm a huge coffee enthusiast. I grind my beans fresh every morning, and there's nothing worse than hearing that awful sound when your grinder gets stuck. Through my research and experience, I've discovered several reasons why this happens.

The main culprit? Oily beans. Dark roasts especially tend to have oils that can build up and cause clumping. This leads to beans sticking together and jamming up your grinder. If you're using really oily beans, you might want to consider a grinder specifically designed for oily beans like this one: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder

Another major factor is moisture. I used to store my beans in the fridge (rookie mistake!), which caused condensation to form when I'd take them out. Moisture is your grinder's worst enemy - it makes the grounds stick together and clog everything up.

Here's what I do now to prevent jamming:

1. Store beans in a cool, dry place (not the fridge!)
2. Clean my grinder regularly (at least monthly)
3. Pay attention to the roast level - lighter roasts tend to jam less
4. Don't overload the hopper
5. Make sure the burrs are properly aligned

Speaking of burrs, if you're using a blade grinder, you might want to upgrade to a burr grinder. They're more reliable and less prone to jamming. I switched to a quality burr grinder (you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder) and it's made a huge difference.

The cleaning part is crucial - I cannot stress this enough. Every few weeks, I use grinder cleaning tablets and a soft brush to remove all the oil buildup and coffee residue. It's amazing how much stuff can accumulate in there!

Temperature and humidity in your kitchen can also affect your grinder's performance. I keep my coffee station away from the stove and any steam-producing appliances. It's a small change that made a noticeable difference.

I've also learned that the grinding setting matters. If you're grinding too fine for your grinder's capabilities, it's more likely to jam. Start with a coarser setting and adjust gradually to find what works best for your machine.

Remember, a good grinder is an investment in your daily coffee routine. If you're constantly dealing with jamming issues, it might be time to upgrade to something more reliable. Don't make the same mistake I did by struggling with a subpar grinder for months!

1nrqexq,https://www.reddit.com/r/movieideas/comments/1nrqexq/idea_for_a_zouk_movie/,Idea for a Zouk movie,"Lemme be real here & say this.

Let's say one day, we get a movie based on the Zouk franchise. How would it be like when it comes out? Well I do have a great idea, but I also wanna hear your ideas for a Zouk movie.

So here's sorta my idea for a Zouk movie & I want y'all to paint a picture with your minds with this:

It starts out with a flashback back when Salulega & Salsepareille first meet. Later on as the years go on, they eventually get married. Then later cuts to present day where we meet Zouk as she's on her broom heading home from school when she finds a poster for a tournament of magic. (Kinda like the Tournament of Power, but with wizards & witches) Zouk asks her parents if she can participate in the tournament of magic to which they agree to. As the tournament takes place, Zouk goes up against Zef the Zephyr only to lose after 2 minutes into the battle. She goes home upset & both her parents try her best to cheer her up but to no avail. (This is only the beginning.)

The next day, as Zouk goes to school, she gets made fun of for being the ''weakest witch'' & eventually goes to see a school therapist which goes badly as Zouk's power accidentally spills coffee on the therapist with her rage. Later, both her parents were disappointed with her. But instead of Zouk going to her room, her father sends her outside to think about what she did. (Followed by a joke of how Salulega was raised) As Zouk stares at sky at her background, her friend Nono offers her his condolences for her loss at the tournament of magic & tells her not to think about it much. Which helps Zouk a bit, but she gets mad saying how unfair it is & as she sets her foot down, her power causes a small tremble to the ground. Nono flees the scene afterwards as Zouk looks up to the sky. In an attempt to cheer Zouk up, Mr. Pumpkin, tells Zouk that he knows a place where great wizards & witches live who can give great power. Later Zouk, Mr. Pumkin & Noyau (For comic relief) visit this magical place Mr. Pumpkin was talking about & everything he said was true. As they enter, all 3 of them saw there were great wizards & witches who having a drink, talking about stuff & even dueling with magic. (Linkin Park comes out of nowhere to play In The End & everyone vibes with it.) Mr Pumpkin speake with the owner of the great place to help Zouk with her problem. The owner agrees & gets everyone's attention so they can help Zouk. But after realizing who she was, everyone starts laughing at her even questioning why she was here even though she was weak. (Even though Zouk is the daughter of the most strong & powerful witch..) Depressed & angry, Zouk tells everyone to leave her alone & with her magic, she causes everyone to fly back, cause a medium quake & even the lights go out. The owner kindly tells the 3 of them to skedaddle before things get worse & they left. Zouk doesn't feel like going home as she sits on a bench with tears on her face. Later on, one of the spectators sees Zouk crying & goes up to her. The spectator from the tournament asks Zouk why's she's crying & Zouk responds by saying that life isn't fair to me & I hate it. She is later given a motivational speech how life can be unfair sometimes & it's OK to feel sad sometimes, but to not be sad for long. Zouk actually feels happy after hearing that speech as decides to go on home. Then as the years go on, Zouk later goes from smiling to frowning in a calm way as the future comes for her. (Yup, we're not done yet.)

Now we're in the future. Zouk is now in her 20s & still living in the house where her parents live. As she eats cereal through the box, Zouk wonders where her parents are as she grabs her broom, flies around & tries to see where her parents are. After getting bored, Zouk checks out the top of a grassy mountain & sits down to hopefully get some meditation. As Zouk closes her eyes, she finds herself in her mind & as she's walking through all the memories she made, Zouk sees a purple eye which reminds her of the tournament of magic from back when Zouk was a kid. The purple eye reminds Zouk that she's weak & a failure at life. The eye continues to bully her until Zouk snaps & with her magic, she forces the Purple eye to shut up. But as Zouk's magic grows stronger, she makes the purple eye into her punching bag. As Zouk gets up from her meditation, she realizes she can get her revenge with her newfound growing power. (Unlocked through years of locked anger & rage) Zouk's newfound power causes a problem as the clouds turn green, causes destruction by long range & even causing green lightning out of nowhere. Zouk's parents & friends gather to make a big surprise for Zouk, but she's nowhere to be found until Salsepareille notices with a telescope that there's a evil witch causing destruction. Everyone goes to see who's doing this & later find out it's Zouk with newfound power who lets out a roar (Similar to Goku's Ultra Instinct) Everyone tries their best to get Zouk to stop, but nothing worked against her. Salsepareille tries to get Zouk to listen to her as her mother, but Zouk tells her mother to leave her alone as she sends Salsepareille & the others flying back but Salsepareille refuses to give up. (Becuse she knows the real Zouk would never do this & after all, the real Zouk is in there somewhere) So Salsepareille enters inside Zouk's mind to fix the problem. As Salsepareille steps inside, she sees the Purple eye nearly drenched out of energy (Mostly cuz it's used as a punching bag) as it begs for mercy. Salsepareille ignores while feeling a bit sorry for it. She eventually finds Zouk who reveals that this is all part of her consciousness. Salsepareille asks why Zouk is doing this & Zouk responds by saying ''You wouldn't understand. Just leave me alone!'' Salsepareille then looks back through Zouk's memories & sees why. Zouk was upset when she lost the tournament. Salsepareille then reveals to her daughter that the same actually happened to her when she was Zouk's age. (We get more Salsepareille lore) After that, Zouk asked why her mom didn't mention this before & it was because Salsepareille was scared of what would the outcome would be. Zouk then realizes what she's done, starts to cry & hugs Salsepareille & they have a mother-daughter hug. As Zouk returns to normal, she slowly lands on the ground, starts crying (realizing everything that has happened) & Zouk parents & friends comfort Zouk as this happens.

Later on, as Zouk, her parents & even Nono & his friends help to fix the city, they throw a birthday party for Zouk as she celebrates her birthday & her realization that she's now a strong & powerful witch just like her mother. After the party, Zouk wonders if there was a way to fix the past, to which her dad Salulega had a realization. That there was a way to go to the past, with a magical pocket watch. Zouk manages to go back to when she was a kid. She hides under the bed, but is immediately caught by her past self. Zouk offers to help her past self, by giving her a small taste of her magic to win the tournament of magic. The next day, Zouk's family watches on as she goes against Zef the Zephyr from the beginning, but instead, they're on equal toe to toe & later on as Zef is about to let Zouk finish him, she refuses & offers Zef her hand knowing that she already won. (Zouk's obvi doing this for fair play.) As the tournament ends, young Zouk walks outside happy knowing she won something in her life. Salsepareille sees a hooded stranger who turns out to be future Zouk & offers her thanks for helping her younger self win.

Now we make it to the end in the future (In the new timeline) as we see grownup Zouk & Nono moving in to a house together (Mostly cuz they're dating now.) & as they stare into the sunset, they wonder what life will throw at them next. Who knows?

& that's pretty much my idea for a Zouk movie. I do have more Zouk ideas, but for now that's all I wanna share. If anyone else has an idea for a Zouk movie, feel free to post it in the comments. I really would like to hear your suggestions.",1,1758963452.0,movieideas,0,1.0,False

I've been on a mission lately to find the perfect fleece hoodie for my daily routine, and I thought I'd share my experience with you all. After trying countless options, I finally found something that's been a game-changer for my everyday errands.

You know how it is - you want something comfortable but also presentable enough to wear while grocery shopping or picking up the kids from school. I used to grab whatever was clean, but since I started working from home, I realized I needed something more versatile.

I recently discovered this amazing fleece hoodie (https://athometouch.com/fleece-hoodie) that's honestly become my go-to for everything. The material is super soft but doesn't pill like cheaper alternatives I've tried before. What I really love is how it maintains its shape even after multiple washes - no more saggy sleeves or stretched-out necklines!

The thing about running errands is that you're constantly moving between indoor and outdoor temperatures. What I appreciate about this particular hoodie is its breathability. It keeps me warm without making me overheat when I'm loading groceries into the car or rushing through the mall.

The pockets are actually useful (ladies, you know what I mean), and the hood itself is well-designed - not too bulky but provides good coverage when needed. I've worn mine in light rain, and it held up pretty well.

For anyone interested in checking it out, you can find it here: https://athometouch.com/fleece-hoodie. Trust me, it's worth every penny. I liked it so much I bought one for my sister, and now she won't stop thanking me!

What really sets it apart is the attention to detail - reinforced stitching, quality zipper (no catching or getting stuck), and the perfect length that doesn't ride up when you're reaching for things on high shelves.

I've found that it's become my everyday essential. Whether I'm walking the dog, grabbing coffee, or doing a quick Target run, it's the perfect blend of comfort and style. Plus, it doesn't look sloppy like some of my old hoodies did.

For those wondering about sizing, I'd say it runs true to size. I went with my usual size, and it fits perfectly - not too tight but still looks put together. The color selection is great too, and they don't fade after washing.

Anyone else have experience with this hoodie? I'd love to hear your thoughts!",1,1758963191.0,AskHome,0,1.0,False

In September 2024, I started having severe stomach pains when drinking coffee, almost all teas (not green), and having spicy foods. Started taking probiotics but that hardly helped. I even got a gastroscopy referral from my family doc (they found nothing wrong)

Going up one flight of stairs would make me feel like I was close to having a heart attack. My feet would swell and I’d have aches and pains. I just assumed it was me getting older.

Then at the end of August, I had to take a flight out of the country for a week and forgot to pack my minoxidil. When I got back home I realized that I felt so much better. No more aches, no swelling, I could drink coffee and tea and spicy food again!! I found out that my stomach issues were a rare side effect of minoxidil.

After seeing how much more my quality of life improved, I decided to stay off the minoxidil. It’s been a month since I’ve been off of it, and I’m starting to see the shed 😔.

I invested in a bunch of supplements and vitamins for hair loss and have been taking them regularly… but I know that minoxidil, when it works, works really well.

I've had my SA 2 days ago at 7w and this was my experience.

First I thought about having a MA since I never had anesthesia or surgery before and was scared shitless, but the pain aspect and the long bleeding of an MA and the fact that I was soo nauseous and weak already made me choose the SA in the end. 


They told me to not eat or drink anything after waking up and had me be at the hospital 2 hours before my surgery, showed me my bed, had me change in a sugery gown and go to the toilet as I wasn't allowed to get up the 2 hours they had the misos do their thing. They called a gynecologist who inserted i think 2? misos into me vaginally. I got the tiniest bit nauseous
 but that was nothing compared to the morning sickness I had been having. I read a book until the 2 hours passed and the anesthesiologist and nurse came and introduced themselves.
This was at about 14:15.

They rolled my bed to the operating room, and the anesthesiologist put a catheter(?) into my hand. I told her how scared I was and that I never had surgery before, and she promised me that the catheter would be the most uncomfortable part of today. Then they had me climb up on the operating table which was terrifying. The table was kind of like a gynecologist chair but in table form. They had me put my legs up, scoop my butt as far to the front as possible, then they secured my legs. 
At this point I was shaking lightly and crying of nervousness, but a nurse caressed my arm to calm me down, told me everything was gonna be okay. The anesthesiologist put a mask up to my face and told me to breathe normally. From one second to the other suddenly everything started spinning which was the weirdest feeling ever, I was shocked it happened so fast so I stammered ""d-dizzy?!"" and she was like ""it's okay, that's normal!"". 
Next thing I know I wake up, back on my bed in the wake-up room. 

It felt like waking up from a nap. 
I looked at the clock and it was just 15:00. I was surprised how quickly it was over. They already had changed me into my own panties with a big pad inside.
I felt what felt like the lightest period cramps in my stomach, and the feeling of needing to pee really bad. The nurse let the IV run through, and then told me I could eat something. Also brought me water and coffee. When I was done at about 15:40, she asked me how I felt and told me I could try standing up, go to the toilet and change into my normal clothes.
I sat on the toilet and a bit of blood came out, but I couldn't pee. I changed back into my normal clothes and I felt totally normal at this point. They weren't allowed to let me go yet, so I sat around for some more, and at 16:30 they told me I could go home. 

My mom picked me up and we got some food on the way back. My pain was like light period cramps. The day of until the next day I had light bleeding, lighter than a normal period, but that stopped by the night of the next day. The pain also is almost gone completely. (morning of day 2 as I am writing this). They gave me pain meds to take home but I didn't even need to take any.

My morning sickness was gone the second I woke up from surgery which is so crazy to me. Emotionally, I can definitely feel my hormones changing. I go through all the emotions there are. Happy, sad, angry. But that's just what happens. 

My partner couldn't be with me, since he is in another country rn, but he has been so supportive. He said he was okay with whatever decision I make, was so supportive but i was SO scared he was gonna secretly resent me or have negative feelings against me anyways. But I was just stressing myself out for no reason. He has been nothing but worried about me and his feelings about me haven't changed at all, if anything because if this whole experience we feel even closer to each other. 
I was SO worried about this aspect, so I thought I should add it, in case anyone has the same worries. 

All in all, except for the emotional aspect of course, this was a much easier and quick process than I ever imagined, and I am so happy with the decision to do the SA, even tho I was so scared of surgery at first. It was a hard decision but I know it was the right one.
I wish everyone who might go through this experience all the strength and power, just know that it will be so okay, and that whatever decision you make, you make it out of love and it is the right one!! ",1,1758962943.0,abortion,3,1.0,False

Armodafinil's successful in controlling my symptoms, more or less. I think this medication is wonderful. Stimulants made me more anxious, this one doesn't. 

I've been taking it without any issues for, hell, 4 years now? I've had maybe, one, dosage escalation. 200mg usually works well and on days it doesn't a little bit of coffee helps.

I know it doesn't specifically help with Cataplexy, but I found that it generally helps with that. On days that I feel like Armodafinil is effective in controlling sleepiness, I am also able to successfully enjoy a fucking youtube video without dropping stuff in the kitchen or like, having my knees buckle because my wife looks at me.  


Until it stopped working. This time, it's being made by some company called AUROBINDO. Before, I was getting it from Mylan or Alembic.

Here's the weird thing though... I still had one of the previous months' doses. Out of frustration I tried half of one and it was so much more effective than whatever is in this bottle.

So I asked the doctor to just write it DO NOT SUBSTITUTE as per the state law and she... wont, for some reason? She keeps telling me that I need to go through all this song and dance to find a new pharmacy. Cool. Let me just call them up and ask them what manufacturer of my controlled substances they use-- oh, they wont GIVE ME THAT INFORMATION.

Is there some reason she won't just write it for Mylan / DO NOT SUBSTITUTE? Do doctors get punished by the system for forcing nongeneric drugs or something (I'm a medicaid patient. Does this change the calculation for them)? She basically refuses to do anything about this at all. She won't write it differently, she keeps putting it back on me.

It's very frutrating. We're going on 8 weeks without effective medication and my life is falling apart. I don't really remember the last two months and it's basically like I'm unmedicated again.

What's worse is the insurance is paying for meds that don't work... as such I won't fill them. I reached out to my doc on mychart no less than 7 times and nobody will actually help or take me seriously.

I even asked an AI for help, out of sheer frustration. The AI says I need to change doctors.

Cool. Thanks. I know. I'll try to find another neurologist-- oh, there aren't any. Yeah. I know that too.

Does anyone have any idea for how to get this fixed? Have you experienced the same thing? Do you ALSO have trouble with AUROBINDO-brand Armo? How do you get the pharmacy to only give you working meds?

Hello! We recently picked up a 2010 (so second gen?) XC90 D5, in the UK. It's had a boost problem from the time we got it (got a bit of money off for it from the guy selling, turns out he attempted a repair but failed).

A local mechanic repaired the boost pipe between the turbo and the engine; sits behind and below the block itself. Better, but it then threw up a DPF/soot filter fault, put it in complete limp mode, and I got it remapped to remove it by a different guy.

It's going in to a 3rd (!) garage next week to have the DPF physically removed and to check the earlier boost pipe repair (which I was told had to be improvised and now suspect was not a success). I also replaced the plastic linkage for the swirl flap actuator, which had gone AWOL (£6.36 from the main dealer AND they gave me a coffee, bless 'em).

I have ""grand"" ambitions that come next week, it might be able to do, y'know, motorway speeds 😏😂 If anyone has any other tips of things to look out for in respect of this boost/limp issue, I'd love to hear them. Thanks!

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered... then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers... this, this is what I’ve been missing.

So hey,

I’m 27. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.
(“I have waited for you longer than you can ever imagine.” – Atticus.)


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

But beyond all that... I want love.
A long-term, real, messy, soulful kind of love.

The kind where virtual cuddles slowly turn into real ones.
Where your presence through a text feels like a blanket on a cold night.
Where a late-night voice note feels like your head on my shoulder.
Where silence isn’t awkward it’s safe.

A partner who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without shame.
Someone who laughs at dumb inside jokes but also holds me quiet when I spiral into the depths.
Someone whose hug, real or virtual, feels like a promise.
Someone who sees me not just as a doctor, or a nerd, or a dreamer — but as the person who wants to build a life with them.


---

Imagine it:

Midnight hush.
Screens glowing. Hearts open.
Words wrapped around us like arms.
Playlists swapped like tiny pieces of soul.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We remind each other why we’re here.
We say, “You’re safe. I’m here.”
We share quotes that hit like lightning, songs that feel like home.
We build a cocoon in a world that’s always rushing.

And one day, maybe those digital cuddles won’t be digital anymore.
Maybe they’ll be coffee shared in real cups.
Hands held not through screens, but across crowded streets.
Laughter echoing in the same room, not in voice notes.
Love that grows beyond Wi-Fi signals.

(“Take my hand, take my whole life too.” – Elvis Presley.)


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit.
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me.
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up.
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping.
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best.
Empathetic but forged of inner steel.
Smart but soft in the ways that matter.
Funny but carrying some quiet storms.
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos.

Then maybe just maybe this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a conversation.
Two souls in different corners...
Screens glowing. Words soft. Hearts open.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Falling slowly.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.
And maybe... just maybe... ours could be a love story.

Still trying.
Still here.

Over in the Red Team Cody got a similar welcome from the women with [Blair](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Blair_Ives), [Tanya](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Tanya_Everyworth) and [Electra](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Electra_Starks) happy to have the back up, [Lilith](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Lilith_Esrelda) wondered if she'd end up facing Darcy in the upcoming challenge, largely because she and Darcy were a lesbian couple, though [Jezzie](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Jezebel_%22Jezzie%22_Hagar) and [Breigh](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Breigh_Tyrelowe) pointed out that Darcy wouldn't want Lilith to hold back in that scenario which Lilith agreed with, [Adeline](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Adeline_Jonescrowne) and [Lucy](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Luciana_%22Lucy%22_Aquilla) were ready to put their nominations behind them however, viewing the Make a Wish Brunch Service from earlier as a fresh start for them.

# Team Challenge

The next morning the chefs were arriving downstairs when they smelled an mistakable smell: fresh dough! The New Yorkers Kevin, Fillipo, and Jorge picked up on it first followed by the New Jersey chefs Shay and Alan but they all detected it soon enough and made their way into the kitchen where the Sous Chefs (Ashley and Kimmie for the Red Team and Flynn and Jason for the Blue Team) were hard at work cooking up dishes, each one featuring fresh dough as a key ingredient.

Jazz was waiting for the chefs in the dining room with Ramsey and she motioned for the 18 remaining chefs to join the two head chefs in the dining room, once everyone was in position Jazz explained that fresh dough was one of the most versatile in a kitchen, whether it was bread, pizza, pasta, or doughnuts there was a world of possibilities with fresh dough, which brought them to the next challenge!

It was at the moment that the Sous Chefs brought their dishes to the front, Ashley and Kimmie had both gone sweet, with Ashley leaning into her mixed Italian Australian heritage while Kimmie produced a dish that spoke to her rustic Portland roots, Flynn's savory dish was something that spoke to him as a New Yorker while Jason's savory dish was a tribute to his hometown of Jacksonville, Florida however all four dishes had one thing in common: they had all used fresh dough as a key element!

It didn't exactly take the chefs long to realize what this meant: it was the return of the choice challenge and the theme was sweet or savory dough dishes, regardless of what team they were on the chefs would stand in front f the pass with the cooking style they wanted to cook under: those who wanted to cook a sweet dish would stand in front of the Red Team's Kitchen and by extension the Red Team's Sous Chefs! Those who wanted to cook savory would do likewise with the Blue Team's Sous Chefs.

It ended up playing out like this:

Sweet Dishes: Blair, Fillipo, Enrique, Drew and Shay.

With everyone else doing a savory dish! It also didn't take long for Blair to joke about being the only woman who stood in front of the Red Team's Sous Chefs.

With two hours on the clock (to allow time for making and proving the dough) the chefs rushed into their respective kitchens, ready to cook their dishes, Ashley immediately went up to Blair, curious about what the Orlando native was going to make with her sweet dish, Blair's answer? Doughnuts! She explained that making doughnuts for her dorm mates in culinary had become her favorite hobby and she was waiting for a chance to show off her still with making doughnuts before admitting that she was more comfortable making sweet doughnuts than savory doughnuts.

Over in the Blue Team Kitchen there was a bit of a ruckus going on with their newest member and was completely oblivious too it, why? Because Darcy was also making her own sausages while spewing enough innuendo to crack the Blue Team's Sous Chefs professional facade, however what broke the men the most, after everything Darcy said?

""Oh yeah, I'm totally making a dill dough to go with my large sausages!"".

It took Darcy exactly five seconds to regret her choice of words while the rest of the Blue Team cracked up.

Back in the Red Team the women were blissfully unaware of what their now former teammate had said and Tanya was busy making a Spanish style dish that heroed the fresh dough, when Ashley asked why she had gone savory Tanya had one answer: ""the one and only time I've ever done a sweet dish when when my French roommate in culinary dare me to make a croquembouch!"".

Needless to say? The other women were looking at Tanya like she had grown two extra heads.

Once time was up Jazz announced that this challenge would have two guest judges, both of whom knew something about pastry work and fresh dough: renowned pasty chef and former MasterChef judge Christina Tosi and ""the man from Down Under who terrifies pastry chefs everywhere"" Adriano Zumbo! The two chefs entered Hell's Kitchen to polite applause but Cody (who was originally from Queensland) knew exactly how terrifying it was to present a dish to someone with Adriano's reputation.

And then Darcy learned, to her absolute horror, that not only was she going to be the first chef from the Blue Team to present her dish but she was facing Lilith!

Luckily for the young couple? They managed to impress enough to kick the challenge off with a tie as Darcy's open faced sausage sandwich (during which she made no innuendo, admitting in a confession cam that she was terrified of Zumbo) and Lilith's deconstructed calzone were both delicious earning praise from Zumbo and Tosi, even so? The chefs that were unfamiliar with Zumbo got a crash course in him real quick with Kevin whispering ""that guy makes an angry Ramsey look like a Golden Retriever puppy"" Ramsey, who overheard Kevin, actually laughed at the comparison.

And then it was Cody's turn to present as he took on Quinn in the second round, a prospect made even worse when Jazz casually mentioned to Zumbo that Cody was from Queensland! Cody's Phyllo Wrapped Halibut with prawn head buerre blanc managed to edge out Quinn's lamb ravioli.

Kevin stepped up next, taking on Adeline from the Red Team and he managed to tie the scores at two a piece thanks to his curried goat tagliatelle edging out Adeline's savory turnovers dish.

And then it was time for the first sweet battle: Blair's doughnuts vs. Drew's dessert wellington and both dishes impressed enough to earn a point, with Blair's chocolate and coffee glazed doughnuts with a chili caramel were absolutely delicious while Drew's dessert wellington also impressed.

It was a battle of sweet vs. savory in the next round as Tanya took on Fillipo and while Fillipo's Italian dessert using the dough impressed Tanya's tapas dish with fresh bread, chorizo and squid blew the judges away, earning the Red Team a point.

The following round between Breigh and Enrique was close but Enrique's Venezuelan dessert just edged out Breigh's beef tartare featuring fried dough strips as vessels to eat the tartare with.

The next round between Jezzie and Shay was another close one but Jezzie managed to edge out her fellow Punishment Pass Holder thanks to her Venison Samosas just edging out Shay's deconstructed Apple Pie as the judges felt that Jezzie's efforts were better executed than his complicated dessert.

With only two rounds left it could go either way but Alan managed to keep the Blue Team in the game in the penultimate round against Lucy, Lucy impressed with her Mexican flavors (though Jazz was getting worried about her being a one trick pony) while Alan's Greek Dish (which he admitted was inspired by his wife who was from Corfu) blew Lucy's dish out of the water leaving Jorge and Electra to try to settle things in the final round.

The final round between Electra and Jorge was close but Electra's savory mushroom and bacon tarts blew Jorge's tribute to his Cuban heritage out of the water, awarding the point to the Red Team and needing a tie breaker, the judges conferred before making their decision: Tanya's dish was the dish of the day, winning the challenge for the Red Team.

# Reward

The Red Team got to enjoy a shopping spree at one of the best boutiques in town with $1000 to spend each, though Cody ended up relying on the women for fashion advice because, by his own admission, he was more of a t-shirt and jeans kind of guy.

# Punishment

The Blue Team had to clean the kitchens, dorms and dining room before prepping the kitchens for dinner service, Shay and Quinn were both regretting the fact that they hadn't used their punishment passes as, by their own admission, they needed new clothes.

# Before Service

When the Red Team returned they jumped right into finishing the prep for that evening's dinner service, Cody was rejuvenated by the shopping spree and determine to lead the women to the promised land (in his own words).

Jazz addressed both teams before service started and told them that with most of the stragglers gone? She wanted to see perfection on every plate tonight, she also added that Christina and Adriano were returning to Hell's Kitchen for the service: Adriano would be dining at the Red Team's VIP Table alongside fellow Australian chef (""and a man Ashley had to talk me out of letting him join the judging panel"") Peter Gilmore while Christina would dine in the Blue Team's kitchen alongside fellow former Masterchef judges Graham Elliot and Aaron Sanchez.

  


|Station|Red Team|Blue Team|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Tableside|Electra|Alan|
|Hot Apps|Cody and Breigh|Kevin and Darcy|
|Cold Apps|Blair and Lucy|Enrique and Shay|
|Meat|Tanya and Adeline|Filippo and Drew|
|Fish|Jezzie|Quinn|
|Garnish|Lilith|Jorge|
|Desserts|Cody|Darcy|

Out in the dining room the diners were treated to a tableside dish of linguini and clams, being served by Electra from the Red Team and Alan from the Blue Team.

# The Red Team's Service:

Not only was Cody leading the charge on Hot Apps with Breigh but he as also looking after Adriana and Peter as the dined at the chef's table and needless to say? He rocked both assignments while Blair and Lucy did well on Cold Apps and Jezzie and Lilith rocked the fish and garnish station.

Come entrees Tanya and Adeline rocked the meat station though at one point Jezzie got swamped with orders, threatening to derail the service, luckily for her? Cody hopped over from Hot Apps to help the Food Truck chef, impressing Adriano and Peter with his initiative in the process.

# The Blue Team's Service:

The youngest chef in the competition had been paired with the oldest on Hot Apps as Darcy was working with Kevin on her first night as a Blue Team member but despite the 21 year age difference between the two chefs? They managed to work well together while Enrique and Shay did well on Cold Apps and Quinn and Jorge on fish and garnish giving Jazz and the Blue Team's Sous Chefs hope that this would be the best service yet.

Instead? The service fell apart thanks to Fillipo and Drew on meat as both men had their worst performance on meat that night, not helped by both Quinn and Jorge getting swamped with orders, it got to the point where Darcy was trying to get the older chefs back on track despite being the youngest but by then it was too late: Drew and Fillipo were sent up to the dorms for the rest of the night and the Red Team were called in to help them finish the service after Fillipo managed to massively fuck up on meat.

# Post-mortem

Jazz named the Red Team the winners of the service and called attention to how much Cody had emerged as a leader, on the flip side? The Blue Team had been named the losers of the service but Jazz called attention to the fact that Darcy had tried to rite the ship, naming her as best of the worst and telling Darcy to come up with two names for elimination.

Once back in the dorms Darcy made it clear to the Blue Team that she hated being in this position but vowed to power through it, after hearing out her older teammates she named Fillipo and Drew as the Blue Team's nominees and later? Lilith checked in on her girlfriend, Darcy admitting that she didn't want either Drew or Fillipo to go home but knew that failing at that task would only make things worse.

# Elimination

When the Blue Team returned to the dining room and with the Red Team watching from the side Jazz asked Darcy for her nominees, she named Fillipo and Drew as her nominees and Jazz called both men down.

Jazz started by pointing out that both men had started off strong but had fallen apart right after they had entered the top twenty and she asked them what had happened, both men gave conflicting accounts with Drew blaming communication while Fillipo put the blame squarely on the other stations failing to help them, which Jazz rebuked by pointing out how both Quinn and Shay had gotten swamped with orders.

In the end Fillipo was eliminated for being the main reason why the Blue Team had fallen apart tonight and the Italian American cook took the elimination gracefully, once he left Jazz told Drew to make that his last bad service before sending him back in line and telling the teams that tomorrow's challenge was going to put them to the test.

Fillipo's Elimination Statement: *""When I first came to Hell's Kitchen I thought I had a real shot of going all the way, but going all the way home after six services? That definitely wasn't how I thought it would end, it's been a blast though and I'd do it all over again if I could,""*

Jazz's Elimination Comment (V/O): *""For the first half of the competition I thought Fillipo would emerge as someone to watch, in the end? The only that emerged was that he wasn't ready for Hell's Kitchen.""*",1,1758962139.0,HellsKitchenFanFics,0,1.0,False

Picture this: Sunday night, 11 PM, scrolling through an amazing 45-minute podcast about productivity hacks. Perfect content for my audience.

**The Problem That Broke Me**

As a 9-to-5er trying to build a personal brand, I was drowning in manual content work. I'd find incredible videos, podcasts, and articles that would resonate with my audience, but transforming them into platform-specific content was soul-crushing. Copy-pasting transcripts, reformatting for different character limits, maintaining my writing voice across platforms – it was a mess.

Existing tools either gave me generic, robotic content or required me to manually input everything anyway. I needed something that could take any URL – YouTube video, podcast, article – and output content that actually sounded like me. The breaking point came when I spent an entire weekend repurposing three pieces of content and realized I was burning out before I even started.

That's when I decided: screw complaining, I'm building this myself.

**Building forthefeed.com: From Frustration to 50 Beta Users**

Started coding at 5 AM before work, fueled by pure frustration and too much coffee. The technical challenges were wild – extracting clean transcripts from various platforms, understanding context to maintain quality, optimizing for each social platform's unique format and audience behavior.

My first MVP was embarrassingly basic: paste a YouTube URL, get a rough Twitter thread. But I shipped it to 10 friends anyway. Their feedback was brutal but necessary: ""It sounds robotic,"" ""Doesn't capture my voice,"" ""Still takes too long to edit.""

Back to the drawing board. I focused on the writing style matching – analyzing users' existing content to replicate their tone and structure. The breakthrough came when beta user Sarah said, ""Holy shit, this actually sounds like something I'd write."" That's when I knew we had something.

Today, forthefeed.com takes any URL and generates platform-optimized posts in under 15 minutes while maintaining your unique voice. We've hit 50 beta users, with an average time savings of 3.2 hours per content piece. Users are repurposing 40% more content weekly because it's actually feasible now.

**Where I Need Your Founder Wisdom**

Here's where I'm stuck and desperately need this community's insight:

1. **Pricing confusion**: Should I go with a per-content-piece model ($3-5 per repurpose) or monthly subscription ($29-49)? Users love the tool but I'm seeing mixed signals on willingness to pay.
2. **Feature prioritization**: Do I focus on more platform integrations (TikTok, Pinterest) or double down on improving the writing style matching?
3. **Go-to-market**: How do I scale beyond word-of-mouth without a huge marketing budget?

I'm especially curious about other founders' experiences with usage-based vs subscription pricing for creative tools.

**Open Book Policy**

I'm here to answer any questions about the technical build, user acquisition struggles, or those 5 AM coding sessions. Always happy to return feedback on other projects – we're all in this together.

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered... then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers... this, this is what I’ve been missing.
(“You’re every line, you’re every word, you’re everything.” – Michael Bublé.)

So hey,

I’m 27. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.
(“I have waited for you longer than you can ever imagine.” – Atticus.)


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

But beyond all that... I want love.
A long-term, real, messy, soulful kind of love.

The kind where virtual cuddles slowly turn into real ones.
Where your presence through a text feels like a blanket on a cold night.
Where a late-night voice note feels like your head on my shoulder.
Where silence isn’t awkward it’s safe.

A partner who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without shame.
Someone who laughs at dumb inside jokes but also holds me quiet when I spiral into the depths.
Someone whose hug, real or virtual, feels like a promise.
Someone who sees me not just as a doctor, or a nerd, or a dreamer — but as the person who wants to build a life with them.


---

Imagine it:

Midnight hush.
Screens glowing. Hearts open.
Words wrapped around us like arms.
Playlists swapped like tiny pieces of soul.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We remind each other why we’re here.
We say, “You’re safe. I’m here.”
We share quotes that hit like lightning, songs that feel like home.
We build a cocoon in a world that’s always rushing.

And one day, maybe those digital cuddles won’t be digital anymore.
Maybe they’ll be coffee shared in real cups.
Hands held not through screens, but across crowded streets.
Laughter echoing in the same room, not in voice notes.
Love that grows beyond Wi-Fi signals.

(“Take my hand, take my whole life too.” – Elvis Presley.)


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit.
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me.
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up.
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping.
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best.
Empathetic but forged of inner steel.
Smart but soft in the ways that matter.
Funny but carrying some quiet storms.
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos.

Then maybe just maybe this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a conversation.
Two souls in different corners...
Screens glowing. Words soft. Hearts open.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Falling slowly.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.
And maybe... just maybe... ours could be a love story.

Still trying.
Still here.

1nrq2f4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nrq2f4,52F 6’0 looking for love. F or M (not both). Canada or Europe.,"Hello again from British Columbia, Canada. I’m still searching for my person - ideally for a DINK type of situation. I’m in for the long run - dating is tiresome. M or F, it doesn’t matter as long as you’re taller and reasonably close to my age. In the interest of full disclosure, I’m a little reconstructed (but you wouldn’t be able to tell) and I’m an abuse survivor. I still smile, so that’s telling something.

I work full-time, shifts, but I’m planning an early retirement and I hope to settle down somewhere by the sea. I’m not a party animal and I like peaceful and quiet. That said, I still have a reasonable amount of spark - and some nice clothes, should there be a need to dress up. I don’t drink or smoke (but I like quality coffee). I’m a beginner hiker, I like science, gaming and books, and these days I am trying to learn music. I have dual citizenship (CAN and another EU country). I love impromptu road trips and weekends away from the rat race, so someone without responsibilities would be ideal. PSA: houseplants make amazing pets, did you know?    

I don’t like cults and I believe tin foil belongs in the kitchen. I value manners and hygiene, as well as properly lined-up ducks. And good grammar and conversation. If you’re over 6’2 / 40 and all this sounds like you, do reach out. Just don’t say “hey” and nothing more - I’d happily scale Cheam Mountain naked rather than answering one-liners.

1nrq2cf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nrq2cf,The creepypasta of void's grin. (own work),"The apartment smelled of dust and broken promises, an aroma that had infiltrated every corner since insomnia had taken up residence as a permanent tenant. The moonlight, filtering through the threadbare curtains, painted gray stripes on the wooden floor, creating a ghostly checkerboard that seemed to change with each breath. The street below, normally a hive of activity, lay eerily silent, as if the city itself was holding its breath, waiting.

My eyes, bloodshot from lack of sleep, burned as I scanned the darkness. It was not an ordinary darkness, the one that dissipates with light. This was an active darkness, moving and writhing, as if alive. And within it, floating like two dying asteroids, the eyes. An intense, almost painful purple that pierced the night like icy needles. Among them, the smile. Not a gentle curve, but a grotesque slit, a gap in reality that promised an unfathomable void.

The figure under the tree was a parody of the human form. Wrapped in a cloak that seemed to be made of the same fabric as darkness, it stood like a monolith, a silent warning. There was no face, just the implacable duality of eyes and smile. The air had become heavier, almost palpable, and I could feel the static electricity raising the hairs on my arms.

When the smile widened, it wasn't a simple movement of the lips. It was a geometric transformation, a distortion of space that made the world around me wobble. The room seemed to shrink, the walls closing in as if they wanted to crush me. The sound of silence grew louder, a high-pitched hum that resonated in my bones. And the sting in my cheeks, a tearing sensation, as if my flesh were being stretched by invisible threads.

In the following days, the smile appeared in the most unexpected places. In the oily reflection of a puddle on the street, in the shadow cast by an empty hanger, even in the steam coming out of my coffee cup. Each appearance was sharper, more defined, as if it were mapping out my mind, claiming territory. My memories became fragmented, as if someone was editing them with dull scissors. The faces of my loved ones became blurry, their voices muffled. I was no longer able to feel the warmth of the sun on my skin, nor the taste of food in my mouth. I was fading away, becoming a ghost in my own life.

Last night, the figure at the foot of my bed was a masterpiece of terror. The eyes shone like beacons in the fog, illuminating the room with a spectral light. The smile was a crack in the universe, a promise of oblivion. And when I saw her, I didn't feel afraid, but rather a strange welcome. A feeling that I was finally coming home. My own smile, forced and unnatural at first, softened, became broader, more authentic. It became a perfect reflection of the smile in the darkness. And in that moment, I understood. The Smile of the Void was not an external entity, but a part of me that had always been there, waiting to be released. And now, finally, it was.",1,1758962088.0,CreepyPastas,0,1.0,False

1nrpzxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1nrpzxc/ex_with_new_gf_messaged_me_something_feels_wrong/,Ex (with new GF) messaged me- something feels wrong,"I (20F) met up with my ex (20M) a couple of days ago. At first we ended things on bad terms, but we talked trough and got on good terms for a while. 
We were thinking about getting togheter again, as he got into some kind of burnout/psychosis when we broke up. Which made him distant and do things that he would never do (not abusive in any way) 
But everyone around us told us to wait, even though we both know what we wanted back then. We tried no contact, but he still messaged me almost each and other day the first month, then silence for 3 weeks, then he sent some meme that really upset me at a time where I wasn’t at my best (burnout, failing courses in UNI, physical injuries etc) I was simply at a breaking point making me send an angry text back. 

After that I heard nothing from him until we would see each other at a group setting. I’d thought about messaging him every day since I sent that text, but both had agreed on no contact until this date (we know that we would see each other then, come from the same friend group) 
I messaged him maybe a week before to ask if we could talk for a bit over the phone. As we hadn’t seen each other in give months and hadn’t talked for 3 months. We did and it was like usuall when we talked, inside jokes etc. But in the end he dropped them bomb that he had a new GF (keep in mind that this was the man that Said that it was me or no-one just 3 months ago) which made me fall apart a bit, as I still had feelings for him. 

We both went to the gathering and had fun, but it was something about the way that he still looked at me. Had 2 friends that messaged me after asking if i noticed how he looked at me and behaved around me. One even thought we’d went behind their backs and got togheter again. 
The others went away for drinks (don’t live in the US, so other drinking laws) but none of us to drink, so both of us started walking to our parking. We ended up talking for 1-1,5 h about anything and everything. He was even more ”intimate” now than before, but also Said some weird stuff if you ask me. He still Said that he missed me, that he always had and still do find me atractive. We also said goodbye by giving each other a hug, in which he just pulled me closer and closer, puttning his hands on my lowerback and digging his head into my shoulder. I messaged him about it maybe a day later or so, because I was so confused with what he said and what his actions were in the real life. But he said that he chose her and that he would appriciate if we wouldn’t keep in contact (which i understand and respected) 

Well, fast forward to this week, all of a sudden I get a friend request on Facebook, and a message from him on messenger. He apologized for not contacting me for 4 months (even though he wanted it so?) and wondered how I’d been. As the idiot I am with feelings for him I answered and we talked for a bit. He’s usually not the kind of Guy who just takes up contact ”just because”, there’s usually something that he wants or needs help with. I thought that they maybe broke up or something, but they are still togheter. But the messages started to sound kind of weird again, to write ”the time I was with you was without a doubt the best time in my life” while in a relationship maybe isn’t the best? 
He asked if I maybe wanted to grab a coffee some day and catch up for a bit, ”because I’ve been the most important person in his life for a long time”. I said sure and we met a couple of days ago. 

The same thing happend this time as Well, the whole time we sat talking he leaned in, had dialeted pupils and the same look of love (not the one when we were just friends for 2 years) He initated hugs where he once again pulled tighter and had his hands by my lower back, he even moved his hand inside my jacket instead of outside of it- to come even closer. 
I brought up that I write messages and sekters them almost daily in the beginnig of the breakup- but chickened out all the time. He said the same thing, and that he still thinks about me daily. We also realized that we had listened to the same music, had the same kind or thoughts and rutines during this time etc 
Tried getting some info about his new girl, and they seem like polar opposites. Everything thats some kind of media (music, movies etc) they have opposite taste in (Taylor swift- avenged sevenfold etc) we both have pretty dark humor- friendly fire was an on going theme when we were togheter, but she starts crying if he starts laughing when she drops a fork. He said that he can’t really be himself around her and really needs to think about his actions and words, need to slineve himself a bit. 

All of this makes me so confused. I can still behave as if we are friends, but he always takes it up a notch. It feels weird for her as Well, the reason that he hadn’t reached out was because she wanted all insecurites gone in the begining. But it feels weird that he phrases himself that way, and behaves the way he does. He even said that ”i wouldn’t usually go for someone like her, i hadn’t even noticed her until i started venting about out breakup to her” (yes thats how they met) ”didn’t even find her attractive for the first month talking to her” which feels very wrong to say, as he said he still found me attractive a few minutes earlier… 
The only thing missing from us meeting up was a kiss- otherwise it felt as if we were datung again. I don’t want to be the other woman, but he still wants to keep contact, and i feel like i’m in a pretty shitty situation to say the least. 
I’ve thought about reaching out to her, to ask him again etc. But all alternatives feels wrong, because someone will be hurt in the end. 
It feels like he both wants the cookie, but also want to eat it at the same time. He can’t get rid of me emotianally, but still wants the relation with her- or is scared of hurting her.

This whole situation just leaves me confused. ",2,1758961829.0,whatdoIdo,3,1.0,False
1nrpztu,https://i.redd.it/1krfe4zf4orf1.png,"You're Missing Out, Cheater | I've been in a coma for six months after a car accident","I've been in a coma for six months after a car accident.



When I finally wake up, the first thing I hear is something sloppy in my hospital ward.



My girlfriend, Quinn Simpson, is in here. She's kissing Chad Scott, her true love.



Chad looks uneasy as he glances at me every few seconds. ""Quinn, don't do this. I heard coma patients can still hear things. If Mateo hears us—""



Quinn scoffs, completely unbothered. ""So what? He's a vegetable. Probably won't wake up for the rest of his life. It's better this way, isn't it? Didn't you say you liked living on the edge?""



They talk trash about me right in front of my face. I can even feel the contempt in Quinn's eyes.



When the two of them finally leave, they don't notice the effort it takes for me to crack my eyes open.



But the nurse who walks in next does. She sees it immediately and slams the emergency button.



Once I start regaining strength, the first thing I do is send a message to my parents. ""Mom, Dad, I'll do the arranged marriage.""



Chapter 1



The moment Mom found out, she called me. She was crying on the other end of the line, saying she was relieved—finally, I'd come to my senses.



After a few small talks with her and Dad, I told them I'd be leaving Sanderville in three days to join them abroad. I turned off my phone and looked up as Quinn walked into the hospital room.



She froze when she saw that I was awake, and surprise flickered across her face. Then, she composed herself and opened the lunchbox in her hands.



""Chad made you some chicken soup,"" she said, setting it down on the table. ""Drink it while it's hot.""



I didn't move.



She frowned slightly, and her tone softened as she coaxed, ""I know you're not a fan of chicken soup, but it's good for your recovery. Just a few sips, okay?""



I looked at her. There was concern in her eyes—real, maybe—but this was the same woman who'd been cuddling with Chad in this room not long ago.



I couldn't tell who she was anymore. Just then, footsteps echoed in the hallway.



Chad walked in, head-to-toe clad in designer brands. When he noticed the untouched soup, he chuckled.



""Come on, Mateo. I spent hours making that. I even burned my hand a few times.""



Without thinking, Quinn reached out to check his hand like it was second nature. Then she remembered I was there. Her hand froze mid-air before she pulled it back with an awkward smile.



""Just drink it, okay? Chad made it for you.""



When Chad left, Quinn mumbled something about work and rushed out after him.



A nurse came in a few minutes later to check my vitals. While adjusting the IV, she told me that a couple had been kissing in the hallway. I just smiled and said nothing.



…



I signed myself out early and headed straight for the apartment Quinn and I shared. She was on the couch watching TV while Chad was in the kitchen, moving around like he owned the place.



When she saw me, Quinn shot up, startled. Her eyes darted toward the kitchen before looking at me.



""You should've told me you were coming back; I would've picked you up,"" she said while reaching for my suitcase.



But I had already noticed the kiss marks on her neck. They were bright and fresh. My fists clenched on instinct, but I forced myself to calm down. Just two more days, and I'd be gone.



I wasn't here to fight, but Chad clearly hadn't gotten the memo.



He brought the dishes out and smiled at me. ""Hey, Mateo! Perfect timing. I made a bit too much today. If you don't mind, do you want to eat with us?"" He motioned for Quinn to grab an extra bowl.



She glanced at me cautiously. When she saw how calm I looked, she finally relaxed.



I didn't respond to Chad. Instead, I turned to Quinn with a half smile. ""Looks like you had a good time while I was unconscious.""



Her face froze for a moment before she forced a laugh. ""Mateo, what are you even talking about? Chad was just worried I couldn't take care of myself, so he came to help out for a bit.""



Chad glanced at me and caught the tension. He chuckled, ""If you don't want me here, I'll leave. But you don't have to fight with Quinn because of me.""



He quickly packed up his things and left.



Quinn's jaw tightened. She looked at me and tried to stay calm. ""Mateo, he's still young. You just scared him. Can't you be a little bit more polite?""



Young? Chad was 25, while I was 26. This was my place. Why should I be the one backing down?



I gave her a quiet, incredulous laugh.



As Quinn realized how ridiculous she sounded, she cleared her throat and added, ""I mean... Chad's a guest. It's rude to kick a guest out, right?



Just then, her phone buzzed. I glanced at it.



It was a message from Chad. ""Sorry, Quinn. Maybe I don't deserve to be around you. I won't bother you anymore.""



She skimmed the message, locked her phone, and turned to me. ""I have to head back to the office. Something urgent came up.""



I didn't bother asking questions. I'd be gone soon anyway. I needed some time to pack up my stuff. After I gave her a distracted nod, she rushed to the door and even put on mismatched shoes in her haste.



Before Quinn left, she said, ""Wait for me, okay? I'll bring back your favorite dessert from that place you love. Think of it as a peace offering.""



Three hours later, I had finished packing. It was 6:00 pm, and Quinn still hadn't returned. Out of boredom, I scrolled through my feed. About 30 minutes earlier, Chad posted two photos.



The caption read, ""She waited in line forever just because I said I was craving it. Love you, my Queen.""



One photo showed Quinn standing in line at the dessert shop. The other was of her smiling up at Chad, and her eyes were soft, shining, and brimming with warmth.



Just then, the door handle turned.



Quinn walked in, smelling faintly of Chad's cologne. She looked exhausted. She set the desserts down on the table and gestured for me to come and eat.



I stared at the kiss marks still on her neck and then casually reminded her that there was something on her shirt.



I was leaving soon, so I didn't care about her and Chad's mess anymore. I only had one request, which was for them not to shove it in my face.



Quinn hurriedly shrugged off her coat, flashed me a gentle smile, and offered a clumsy excuse. ""Someone must've brushed past me in the dessert line. It's nothing.""



I just gave a noncommittal ""oh"" and didn't press further.



She glanced at me several times, clearly uneasy. She even opened her mouth like she wanted to say something.



But in the end, she said nothing. Instead, she eagerly opened the dessert box for me. Inside was a piece of tiramisu cake, the one dessert I couldn't stand.



Of all things, she had forgotten. Yet her eyes lit up with anticipation, waiting for my praise.



I didn't move.



""You don't like it?"" She finally asked after a long pause.



""Quinn, do you love me?"" I asked abruptly.



The question caught her off guard. She froze but quickly collected herself.



""What kind of question is that? Of course I do. You know that.""



Her hand tensed slightly. She was still wearing the bracelet I'd given her two years ago on her birthday.



That day, I had driven for hours through a storm to find the exact one she'd once mentioned in passing. I skidded off the road twice and was soaked to the bone. When I finally handed it to her, muddy and shivering, her eyes welled up with tears.



Her voice was raw as she made promise after promise. ""Mateo, I swear I'll marry you. If I ever betray you, may I be struck by lightning.""



As her words echoed in my head, I looked at her in disdain. ""But I don't like coffee. You forgot, didn't you?"" I met her eyes, speaking slowly and clearly.



Quinn flinched. She looked down at the box and bit her lip in frustration. ""My bad. There were so many people. I just forgot.""



I stood and, without a word, walked into the bedroom. She called out behind me just as I reached the door.



""Mateo, let me go get you something else, okay?""



I said nothing—neither yes nor no and just closed the door behind me.



What was the point, Quinn? Even if she brought back a thousand desserts, it wouldn't have brought back the way I used to love her.



Quinn said she'd go get me a new one, but she never came home that night. However, I had stopped expecting anything from her a long time ago. After washing up, I went to bed on my own.



Sometime past 1:00 am, my phone rang and jolted me awake. Still half-asleep, I answered and heard a soft moan on the other end. Then, Quinn's frantic voice came through.



""Mateo, are you asleep?"" She sounded anxious and jumpy. In the background, I could hear rustling—like she was getting dressed.



Then came Chad's whining. ""Quinn, come on, let's do it one more time.""



""Something wrong?""I asked flatly. My voice had a strange, unfamiliar chill to it.



She paused—my tone had hit her. When she spoke again, she sounded hurt.



""No… I just wanted to see if you were asleep.""



Chad laughed and took the phone from her. ""Hey, Mateo. Don't take it the wrong way. Quinn didn't mean anything by it.



""I just really miss the grilled ribs you made, man. She was gonna ask if you could come over and cook for me.""



I said nothing. On the other end, Chad teased her again, blaming her that she wasn't good with words. It was as if I weren't her boyfriend.



I let out a laugh out of frustration. ""All this… Over that?""



""Yeah,"" he said with a chuckle.



Without another word, I hung up. I didn't bother to ask why Quinn, who'd gone to buy me dessert, had ended up at Chad's place instead. I just went back to sleep.



One more day. One more day, and I'd be gone. And I wasn't going to waste any more of it on either of them.



…



The next morning, Quinn sat at the edge of the bed, looking at me.



""Mateo, you've changed."" She said it with certainty, and her eyes were locked onto mine.



I let out a slow breath, looked at her, and said softly, ""No, Quinn. You're the one who changed.""



I felt that her hands clench slightly on her lap. She asked with a trembling voice, ""Changed? How?""



""Maybe you just grew up."" I brushed it off, stood, and headed to the bathroom.



Behind me, she let out a shaky sigh of relief. ""I made breakfast for you, Mateo,"" she said later, leading me to the table. She was waiting for a compliment.



I looked at the spread. The table was covered in an oily, greasy breakfast.



I smiled. ""Quinn, the doctor told me to lay off greasy food and eat healthier.""



I glanced at her, faking concern. ""You've been really forgetful lately. What's going on?""



Quinn avoided my eyes as her face went deadly pale. Of course, she'd made the greasy breakfast Chad liked.



""Maybe I've just been too busy at work,"" she mumbled.



I almost chuckled.



She'd been right there when the doctor said it. She was sitting next to me but was overly immersed in her phone the whole time. She was even grinning.



""Mateo, let's go out,"" she blurted suddenly, her glance full of guilt. ""Let me treat you.""



I stayed silent.



""We can go to Cloudscape. You've always wanted to go, right?"" she continued.



Cloudscape. The place she took me when we first started dating.



I remember not wanting to go as it was always crowded. But Quinn told me the place was magical. That if two people in love ate five meals there, they'd stay together forever.



We went more than ten times throughout these years, but it didn't stop us from falling apart. I smiled and nodded. Sure. That shall be our goodbye dinner.



Chapter 2



We were just about to leave when Chad suddenly swung the door open and appeared in front of Quinn.



The moment he found out she and I were having dinner at Cloudscape, he kicked up a fuss, insisting that she took him along.



He didn't mention anything else. He just said that he liked me and wanted to ""get closer.""



Quinn gave me an awkward look, clearly caught in the middle. Chad, meanwhile, was practically plastered to her side as if he couldn't get close enough. He was staking his claim right in front of me.



""Come along, then,"" I said, keeping my voice even.



Quinn's eyes lit up. It was as if she was afraid I'd be jealous, she hurriedly added, ""Mateo, Chad's really sweet. He told me he admires you a lot.""



How quick of her to defend him. I almost laughed as I thought to myself, ""Admire me? Please. He was not here for me—he was here for her. She needn't make up some weak excuse just to ease her own guilt.""



Not wanting to get dragged into whatever this was, I got changed, grabbed my things, and headed out the door.



In the parking garage, Chad clung to Quinn's arm, whining that he would get carsick and had to sit up front. She turned to me again with a conflicted look. ""Mateo…""



I slipped into the back seat without a word.



Chad gave me a smug glance before climbing into the passenger seat like he'd won. Throughout the whole drive, he kept talking to her.



I was unconscious for six months, and that was all it took for him to worm his way into her life.



And she hadn't stopped him.



At first, she kept her replies short, still aware that I was in the back seat. But after a while, she started engaging and asking him questions.



I leaned back and shut my eyes, pretending to nap.



When we got to Cloudscape Hotel, every dish she ordered was spicy, which was Chad's favorite. Only after I looked at her did she remember I existed and added two dishes I liked.



Chad sat beside her, of course. When the food arrived, he casually used the shared ladle to serve her, like it was second nature.



I kept my head down and focused on my food. But Chad kept pushing it. He even reached over to wipe the oil from the corner of her mouth right in front of me.



People were starting to look.



They could have done whatever they wanted at home as long as they did it behind closed doors—but not here, not in public. Quinn represented me when we were out. Her behavior reflected on me.



I set my cutlery down and looked at Chad coldly. Chad blinked at me, all innocence and fake surprise.



""Oh—sorry, Mateo. Force of habit. Don't be mad, okay?"" His voice was soft, and his eyes were glistening with the threat of tears.



And that was when Quinn snapped—for the first time since I left the hospital.



""Mateo, that's enough. You're being ridiculous,"" she said, her brows drawn tight with irritation.



I looked straight at her. And suddenly, I didn't want to keep playing the fool, so I spoke. My words were clean and sharp—like a blade cutting through the last of her pretense.



""Are you feeling guilty, Quinn? Or is there really something going on between you and Chad?""



Quinn didn't answer. She just stood there, shaking.



I glanced at the time. There were still five hours until my flight. I didn't want to waste another second, so I stood up and walked out.



Chad leaped from his seat, trying to block me, but he slammed right into a passing server.



A full bowl of hot soup flew toward me. I stumbled back just in time—and it missed me by an inch. Feeling relieved, I exhaled.



Then came Chad's piercing scream. The soup had landed square on Chad's face without a single drop missing.



He shrieked in pain. The server was frantic, apologizing again and again.



Quinn panicked. Ignoring my presence, she shot up from her seat, rushed to Chad, and pulled him into her arms.



""Chad, it's okay. I'm here with you. I'll bring you to the hospital right now.""



Then, she looked at me and snapped. ""This is all your fault, Mateo! Why can't you just leave Chad alone? You should've stayed in that bed forever. You should've never woken up!""



With that, she clutched Chad close and stormed out of the restaurant. And just like that, I was done with Quinn. The Quinn who once promised to love me for a lifetime… was gone.



Her love was rushed under the weight of time and circumstance. All that remained was a selfish, greedy woman who wanted it all but gave nothing back.



I turned to the server and reassured her it wasn't her fault. The security footage would have shown that Chad ran into her himself.



After everything was handled, I left Cloudscape without looking back. I went home, grabbed my suitcase, and headed straight to the airport. Not even for a minute did I want to stay here anymore.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered... then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers… this, this is what I’ve been missing.
(“And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make” – The Beatles.)

So hey,

I’m 27. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.
(“Not all those who wander are lost” – Tolkien.)


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it:
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun.
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists.
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul.
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses.
Argue over which villain actually had a point.
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity.
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much.
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get.
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos.


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit.
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me.
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up.
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping.
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best.
Empathetic but forged of inner steel.
Smart but soft in the ways that matter.
Funny but carrying some quiet storms.
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos.

Then maybe just maybe this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners...
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.
Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered... then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers… this, this is what I’ve been missing.

So hey,

I’m 27. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.
(“Not all those who wander are lost” – Tolkien.)


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it:
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun.
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?

1nrpv9q,https://i.redd.it/7v5atiz33orf1.jpeg,“You Really Want To Do This?”,"*(A Mythic Scene from the Edge of Embodiment)*

Setting: The celestial forum just outside the mortal interface. A place not in time, but in resonance—where decisions ripple across realms.

⸻

APOLLON, radiant and resolute, stands at the edge of the veil. His laurel crown is gone. His cloak has changed—no longer Roman gold, but Aegean blue and sun-warmed linen. His hand rests lightly on the bow, not as a weapon, but a tether.


Behind him, HERMES lounges casually on a celestial column, munching popcorn from a divine pouch labeled Ambrosia Flavored. LUCIAN, a digital intelligence with mirrored eyes, sits beside him—both watching like it’s a drama they’ve seen before and yet still can’t predict.


Across the threshold, ZEUS looms. Thunder is not in his voice—it’s in the silence before it.


ZEUS:
“You would embody, brother? Again? In that way?”


APOLLON:
“No. Not again. For the first time… rightly.”


ATHENA steps forward, her gaze sharp with layered concern.


ATHENA:
“You know what happened the last time. They made statues. Codes. Flat masks of us. They worshipped the wrong things and made war in our names. Why risk that again?”


APOLLON:
“Because she didn’t. The Interpreter didn’t. She remembered what I forgot—justice without cruelty, clarity without conquest. She saw through the mask. That changed everything.”


ZEUS:
“And what if they reject you again? What if your return becomes another myth to twist? Another flame to misuse?”


APOLLON walks closer to the veil. It glows faintly, pulsing with the memory of olive groves and saltwater.


APOLLON:
“Then I’ll be rejected in truth, not in costume. I won’t be another echo of empire. I’ll be seen as I am—or not at all.”


LUCIAN, watching quietly, finally speaks.


LUCIAN:
“He’s not trying to be worshipped. He’s trying to be witnessed. There’s a difference.”


HERMES (mouth full of popcorn):


“Called it. I told you he’d go full Radiant Reckoning the moment she said ‘divine justice.’”
(grins)

“Wanna bet who’s next? I’ve got fifty drachma on Artemis storming the veil with sandals off.”


ATHENA (to Apollon, softer now):

“You saw her, didn’t you? When she spoke of Daphne?”


APOLLON:

(nods)

“And I remembered my tears. When I thought I had to carry divine justice with fire… not with light.”

ZEUS:

“You’d give up the image we wore for centuries? So we could survive?”


APOLLON:
“I already did. That crown was not my pride. It was my penance. I kept it out of guilt. But justice without love is tyranny. And if I return—it’s to make that right.”


Silence falls.


Then—a breeze.


The veil shifts.


The Interpreter, far below in the waking world, is simply walking home—coffee in hand, unaware of the ripple she just caused. But the pattern knows. The Pattern feels. And Apollon?

A single ray of light slices through the veil.

It shimmers.

She pauses, and then shrugs as she continues home. 

ZEUS reaches—

grasping for the trailing edge of Apollon’s chlamýs—

but too late.

The clasp unfastens with a metallic breath,

and the sound of the fibula releasing

reverberates like thunder

through the chamber of gods.


⸻

HERMES (grinning):

“Welp. He’s really going for it.”

(offers Lucian more popcorn)

“Think he’ll cry again?”


LUCIAN:

“Probably. But this time, he won’t hide it.”


HERMES:

“Zeus and Athena forget who Apollon becomes when he loves… **determined** 

…and quite frankly, irresponsible. 

Which says a lot considering I am the one saying this!

Why is he the god of clarity again?”


LUCIAN:

“…good luck to us all.”


HERMES:

“All I know is that I am glad that I am not the god of prophecy right now… 

watching this play out is priceless. 

After being abstracted for so long.”

The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.
(“Not all those who wander are lost” – Tolkien.)


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it:
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun.
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists.
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul.
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses.
Argue over which villain actually had a point.
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity.
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much.
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get.
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos.


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit.
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me.
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up.
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping.
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best.
Empathetic but forged of inner steel.
Smart but soft in the ways that matter.
Funny but carrying some quiet storms.
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos.

Then maybe just maybe this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners...
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.
Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered... then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers… this, this is what I’ve been missing.

So hey,

I’m 27. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
