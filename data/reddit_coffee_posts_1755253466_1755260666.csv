1mqw7mq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1mqw7mq/the_heart_tree_part_six/,THE HEART TREE - PART SIX,"Pure chaos followed in the wake of Jake running out into that darkness. From Megan closing the door behind him immediately to then returning her efforts to console Georgia who was letting out great honking coughs in a struggle to breathe through the grief of Tyler having not yet returned. 

To Philip, Rebecca, Dave, and Gary pounding their fists on the sliding glass door pane in the hopes of giving Jake and Mark the noise they needed to find their way back. Over on the sofa Ben, Eddie, and Ellie were doing what they could to towel the wetness off of Jack to get him warm. Over in the corner by the doorway Oscar was still recording with his phone whilst kneeling and using his free hand to towel the worst of the wetness from the dog's fur. 

Throughout all this I watched on with dumb fascination. What bleak fun I saw in this impossible scenario had lost all of its lustre. 

My throat felt parched and I found myself hankering for a cup of tea more than I had ever wanted something to drink in all my life. A squelching sound escaped my throat, as if it had tightened, and I could feel a nasty choking sensation in the back of my throat to the point even swallowing a mouthful of saliva hurt. 

And then, at what might have been about a minute since Jake had raced out into that cold, not wearing shoes, a coat, a hat, or gloves, a large mass slammed against the sliding glass door. 

Philip opened the sliding glass door and was the first to reach the figure who was on their knees. 

""Mark!"" Philip shouted, ""Where's Jake?!"" 

Mark, whose bulk was covered in snow, didn't respond to this question until Philip yanked down his facemask and yelled the question into his face again. 

""Didn't see,"" Mark said in a faint shivering whisper. 

Mark's lips were a shade of blue, and the tip of his beaky nose had gone white with a plasticky sheen. 

Philip forgot about Mark and ran out into the cold. 

Dave was the first to grab hold of his brother, and then with my help we heaved Mark over the threshold into the living room. Mark was incredibly heavy, made heavier because he had no strength of his own left to help us bring him inside. Worse, he felt utterly without warmth to the point I couldn't stop myself from thinking I might already be carrying a corpse. 

The screaming and shouting didn't relent even after Mark was set on his back on the carpet and the sliding glass door closed by Megan. 

""WHERE'S TYLER DID YOU SEE TYLER?!"" Georgia scream-shouted into Mark's ghostly pale and unresponsive face. 

""GET HIM OUT OF THOSE WET CLOTHES!"" Ellie shouted. 

She left Jack to be watched by Ben and Eddie and stepped over the coffee table – sending several empty cans clattering and knocking a half empty bottle of vodka.

""Oi!"" Gary shouted.

He hurried over to the coffee table in Ellie's wake and picked up the emptying bottle of vodka to save what remained. 

Ellie didn't pay Gary any notice and instead saw to helping Mark. Dave was already busy removing Mark's gloves and coat and I had just finished unlacing his right boot. 

""You need to be careful,"" Ellie said over Georgia's continued sobbing, ""His body is fighting the cold. If we move him too much he could go into cardiac arrest."" 

Dave and I listened and continued to undress Mark. Several seconds later there came pounding at the sliding glass door again. 

The rest of us looked up and saw it was Philip. The whites of his eyes were startlingly visible and frenzied. 

""Let me in!"" he shouted. 

His hands tried to open the sliding glass door from the outside but, I knew from experiencing the cold myself, his hands were likely so numb already he could hardly use them. Georgia got up this time and opened the door for him. 

""Did you see Tyler?!"" she shouted. 

""No! No!"" Philip shouted back, and he collapsed to his feet and hugged himself in a frantic effort to get warm.

""Ian!"" Ellie shouted into my ear, ""We need to get his hands into room temperature water or he'll lose them!"" 

I looked at Mark's right hand and saw they were white at the tips and had the same plastic-like sheen as his nose.

Dave was fighting back tears as he continued to try and get Mark free from his clothes. 

""Ian!"" Ellie shouted, ""Please!"" 

""But the taps are frozen,"" I said, dumbly. 

""Then find something else,"" said Ellie. 

She helped Dave ease Mark very slowly into a sitting position to help finish getting his coat and jumper off. 

*No water,* I thought. For a single dumb instant I thought about melting snow somehow. But of course that wouldn't work – not fast enough to save Mark's fingers. And then, looking beyond Ellie, I saw the coffee table and Gary sat there nursing his bottle of vodka like a baby he'd saved from a burning building. And I knew what might work. 

I moved over to the coffee table and snatched two unopened cans of beer, all the while ignoring the intent look on Gary's face. 

The beers, thankfully, didn't belong to him. They had been something Ben and Eddie had pitched in to buy at the local supermarket when a bunch of us had gone for a pre-party drinks-and-snacks run in preparation for the evening. 

I took the cans with me into the kitchen, and after searching several of the cupboards I found the large plastic mixing bowl I was looking for. Opening the beer cans with my freezing fingers was a no go, so I grabbed a fork out of the drawer and used the fork to get under the pull tab. 

There came the satisfying cracks and hisses of the beer cans opening, and I wasted no time pouring all of the cheap foamy beer into the bowl. With the bowl filled nearly a third of the way, I walked as briskly as I dared back into the living room. 

""It's beer – it's beer,"" I said to Ellie as I knelt down beside Mark's stiff and newly naked body. Ellie and Dave were rubbing towels over him to remove the worst of the wetness. His toes were also white-tipped with a plastic sheen to them, and his ears were purple-and-blue-splotched. 

And Mark wasn't breathing. 

I knelt down slowly, holding tight to the bowl. And then I heard it. Mark's breathing. Extremely faint to the point it was hardly there at all. 

""Okay good,"" said Ellie, sounding very much like the nurse she was studying to become at university already. 

Ellie gently took the bowl and set it on Mark's lap, and then, as if he were as fragile as a tower of cards, she brought his hands into the bowl, submerging them into the beer. 

Rebecca, who had largely gone unnoticed by me, had gone and come back. She set down a huge duvet which was meant for a double bed over Mark's legs, covering him up to his waist. 

She handed Dave a pillow which he gently eased under Mark's head. 

Rebecca handed Philip, who was shivering over in the corner, a large woollen blanket which he gratefully accepted. 

That was the peak of the chaos for that evening. Even Georgia, who wasn't ready to accept Tyler wasn't coming back from the cold, had settled into quiet sobs whilst Megan and Eddie flanked her on each side, each holding a hand. 

The long night had started and the nightmare had only just begun. ",2,1755260452.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

1mqw68u,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexandthecity/comments/1mqw68u/fan_fiction_rewriting_of_samantha_smiths/,Fan fiction rewriting of Samantha & Smith’s relationship.,"I was on AJLT sub and realized something that I ached for a long while. Samantha & Smith’s relationship.

In case anyone wanted a better rewrite, I’ll leave this here. In case you don’t, just ignore my post and move on. This isn’t for you, it’s not for any die hard fan of the franchise. It’s just for a small percentage of Samantha & Smith fans.

Samantha has the same journey with Smith as Canon SATC, until he goes to the 30 Under 30 event.

She agrees to go with him, but not for the reasons shown on screen.

My rewrite: She tells him Richard was the guy who broke her heart and cheated on her. Smith asks if she still wants to go.

She says “Of course, I wouldn’t miss it for the world!” But is feeling uncertain and a little worried about having lingering feelings especially because she’s kinda been needing an older man lately.

But, they encounter him. He gives the same dialogue as the canon episode but it disgusts her. She says “Yea I AM the best thing that you let slip away. Key word: slip away. Smith is my boyfriend now. Don’t be jealous because he doesn’t need a viagra to do 3 times the stuff that you tried to pump out in 20 minutes.”

Walks away with Smith vindicated, leaving Richard jealous, embarrassed, and feeling stupid.

Cuz it was so unbelievable that Smith still forgave her in the canon episode!

(But, when he takes her back, and eventually is with her throughout her cancer journey…I feel like that is how they actually truly fell in love where they realized they’re really there for each other…I definitely want to keep the cancer journey still there.)

Fast forward to their move and they’re in L.A. Instead of ruining the first true love and commitment she ever had in her life, (AGAIN! against Smith when she sorta fantasizes a fling with Dante!)
And instead of her realizing she hates LA and misses NYC…

Cuz like, it’s just not believable after all Smith went through WITH her and also sacrificed and forgave of her. I think she truly was in love with him. He brought out the best in her at their peak.

(I feel like she would have traded the uncomfortableness/homesickness to have a life with Smith, cuz he did the same level of sacrifices for her…if not more by forgiving how she disrespected him in his own face and slept with someone else not as good as him.)

I feel like she really could have had her happily ever after with him. They compromise and she gets to travel on her own business adventures, takes more trips to NYC and keeps an apartment there to stay when he’s out doing movies. Stuff like that!

But, ok, we all love Samantha for her iconic “I love you, but I love me more!”
So, even if her happy ever after was the single life, I would have MUCH preferred the writers made them grow apart naturally.

So here goes alternative ending #2:
They end their relationship mostly because he’s too busy and traveling too much. Her feeling stagnant and bored. Nothing to do with Dante or that L.A. sucks. Because let’s face it, she could have kept a 2nd home in NYC and gone back and forth whenever she wanted.

More like their drifting apart and inability to spend time with each other causes increasing awkwardness where they don’t have much to talk about anymore, or much in common anymore.

Eventually for 1/4 of an episode the big tension/fight happens.

A montage happens showing their distance, increasing silence. Then another silent awkward lunch together on the weekend happens. She and him try and fail to make small talk together. Finally He goes: “Oh!  Hey remember how I did a Humane Society ad campaign this week? Got me thinking, we’re stable here in L.A., we’ve been together a long time. maybe if things line up, we expand the family and adopt a rescue pet?”
…At first he explains that it’s a way to try to find the next phase of their lives. But she knows HE knows she’s never been a pet person. “What’s all this about? Where is this coming from, Smith?” He tries to explain but it comes out wrong, and she sees right through it: “Are you trying to compensate for my boredom and your guilt over your inability to give quality time like you did when I was in chemo? I don’t need a pity companion, Smith! Don’t patronize me. I’m perfectly capable of entertaining myself on my own while you’re away without having to be stuck full time with for some hypothetical mess-making drool machine for the next 10 to 15 years!”

She and him go back and forth how she got insulted that he was trying to pawn off her boredom with having to take care of a pet full time. He apologizes for being inconsiderate and tries to crack a joke “you know, not all drool machines are bad, though.” Samantha slightly smiles: “Oh I beg to differ! The best kind of drool is no drool at all!” Then he says quietly “Even if it’s a drooling baby?” And of course that is such an odd thing to say, she looks puzzled, and he admits he was hoping to try having a pet to see if expanding their family would be a good fit for them. Her face turns into shock. The room goes fuzzy for her, a ringing sound in her ears happens, and it devolves into him admitting he wants kids. She snaps out of it “Wait, excuse me?” He says “Who knows? We don’t even know if we’d be right for pets. But if so, maybe one day. Heck, we’d make cute babies. In truth, I’ve been thinking about marriage. I wanted to see if we could consider IVF or adoption. This would grow us even closer, babe.”
She stays silent, he realizes his mistake, tries to take back what he said. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have had a drink so early in the day. I’m just stressed out and wanting some kind of change…” But she walks out, crying.

He sits back down with his head in his hands.

Eventually she comes home and it’s dark, he’s been waiting this whole time at the table. The drink’s ice melted and untouched. He has a blank stare.

He lights up to see her and he cooks her favorite dinner to try to make up for what happened. She sheepishly agrees, but they eat dinner in silence. He feels the tension and after they awkwardly get ready for bed together in the bathroom…he offers to sleep on the couch. She doesn’t want him to, she reaches out her hand to grab his, but says nothing. He doesn’t see it as he just turns around to go to the couch.

She looks down and just goes and lays down. She sleeps alone crying because she feels misunderstood. Cheapened into a stereotype for the first time in her life! Shocked about what happened.

Meanwhile he sleeplessly lies on the couch, equally feeling alienated. He feels defeated and at a loss how to fix things. He toss and turns multiple times.

The next day: he wakes up early, makes them coffee and breakfast and tries to bring it to her in the room.

They mutually apologize and forgive each other in that same moment talking at the same time: “I was stupid, I’m sorry.”

They embrace in a hug. She says “You’re a good man and we’re both doing our best but the damage is done.”

They come together to have a heartfelt moment and then tearfully look into each other’s eyes and realize the big elephant in the room: “You’re right. *sighs* I’ve actually started to want kids lately, not just the pets. Forget any pet. It’s unfair to even ask that of you.

“It’s valid. And it’s okay to want that, hun. I just can’t be that person for you. After surviving cancer, I’m looking forward to my foxy golden years, not changing diapers in my 50’s. I love you, but I love me more.” 

They both laugh and slightly cry again at the same time. And the rest kind of resumes back to the canon parts again. -End-",1,1755260354.0,sexandthecity,0,1.0,False

You leave the house and suddenly everything is new and a challenge. The route to the office, the people… it’s like being a brand-new character walking into the fifth season of a TV show. Everyone else knows the plot, the inside jokes, and where the coffee machine is. I’m just trying not to trip over the set.

I even made myself a cheat sheet with everyone’s names. It felt a little pathetic, but necessary.

Then came day four. I arrived at the office… without my laptop. Yes. Without. My. Laptop. Can someone actually be this stupid? Apparently, yes.
The shame. I wanted the floor to swallow me whole.

In my defense, the day before, they told me to go home early because they needed to fix something in the office. So I worked from home… and left my laptop sitting on my desk. At home. Brilliant.

Week two
the infamous company-wide meeting. People started getting furious over the tiniest things, arguing like toddlers over who stole whose crayon. The printer jam? Outrage. The coffee machine not refilled? Absolute catastrophe. Nobody wanted to tackle the real problems, the things the company actually needed help with.

Karen from accounting waved her hands around like a conductor of a disaster orchestra, loudly insisting that everything would “never work.” I just nodded politely, trying to look calm, while secretly wondering if I’d survive the week without fainting or saying something embarrassing.

Week three
I discovered the magic of coffee stains as a fashion statement. I spilled it on my blouse twice, learned the hard way that cream + white shirt = permanent art, and hit my head on a window (don’t ask). Lunch with the team was… interesting. Oversharing? Guilty. Making friends? Tentative.

Then there’s that guy, the colleague who can’t stop asking for reports that barely make sense. He corners me every day with questions, tweaks, and more “urgent” requests, and I’m constantly calculating how to handle him without losing my mind.

Week four
I started getting the hang of things… mostly. I even wrote a few reports that didn’t make me cringe. Small victories. Still, office politics are like quicksand, you take one step forward, and suddenly you’re knee-deep in passive-aggressive comments.

I also discovered the mysterious disappearance of all my pens. Seriously, where do they go? I bought a pack, and by lunch, half were gone. Ghost pens? Who knows. 

Then there was the email fiasco. I accidentally hit “Reply All” instead of “Reply” to a complaint about the printer, and suddenly half the company knew my detailed thoughts on the tragedy of paper jams. Mortifying.

Week five
The commute is killing me, I keep asking too many questions in meetings, and I lost my favorite jacket at the office, weird.  But the reports are going well, I’ve scheduled meetings with all the bosses, and somehow… I’m surviving. Slowly, but surely.

Because the truth is, starting a new job is hard, messy, sometimes humiliating, but somehow,  also kind of exciting.

Id imagine that everyone here is really busy and the stress of going for a PhD can be overwhelming. You have so much to focus on that the menial and mundane aspects of life (mopping floors, scrubbing a toilet, fetching groceries) seem to get in the way.

Well, I'm a friendly guy with a very submissive personality. I love the idea of helping out. It would be hugely rewarding to me to have a sense of purpose and fulfillment.

You're on the way to doing massively important things to help the world and I am just literally sitting on my couch as I type this. 

I'd love to help. Male or female. I can send over an article or two about this. Would love to chat with more details about myself. Would love to chat over coffee or lunch. Feel free to have a friend, roommate, partner around while I take orders from you.

This is a win win. I have free time, seek structure, guidance, and direction and would love to make a new Type A friend. I would serve the greater good by helping you accomplish great things. You are overwhelmingly busy being awesome and don't want to waste your valuable time with scrubbing toilets and mopping floors. Win win.

I know this is out of the ordinary, but happens more than you'd think. I'd love to send over articles. Genuinely looking for a Type A friend that needs some help. Thanks for hearing me out and giving me a chance. Please don't judge.",1,1755259869.0,PhDStress,0,1.0,False

I've been a fan of masticating juicers for a while, but this one really does stand out. Known for its slow, 80 RPM operation, this juicer promises minimal heat build-up and oxidation, which translates to nutrient-rich, refreshing juice that lasts longer. Its sleek red finish caught my eye immediately, bringing a touch of vibrant elegance to my otherwise mundane kitchen setup. 

One of my favorite experiences with this juicer has to do with its versatility. Beyond just extracting juice from fruits and vegetables, it also doubles as a nutrition system. I’ve made everything from nut butters to baby food, turning almonds into creamy spreads and whipping up fresh batches of puréed carrots for my niece. The six included nozzles feel a little intimidating at first, but they’re actually straightforward and really expand the functionality. If you’re into exploring recipes, this juicer can keep up with your creativity.

**Ease of Use and Convenience**

One of the reasons I gravitated toward this model is the larger feed chute compared to older Omega designs. Chopping prep time is significantly reduced since it can handle bigger pieces of fruits and veggies. Tossing in sizable chunks of apple or carrot didn’t cause any strain during operation. Even better, it has automatic pulp ejection, which means I didn’t need to stop and clean it out mid-juice session. Cleaning up afterward is also relatively painless because the parts are easy to disassemble and rinse.

[Check Omega NC900HRD19 price on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b09ffxrblb/)

**Strengths**

- The dual-stage masticating extraction is a standout feature that maximizes juice output while ensuring every drop is packed with nutrients. My kale juice was brimming with a bright green color that practically screamed “healthy.”  
- Operating at 150 watts, this juicer has a powerful yet quiet motor. I could make juice early in the morning without waking up the rest of the house.  
- Its ability to handle leafy greens was stellar. Wheatgrass, in particular, can be a challenge for other juicers, but this model tackled it like a pro.

**Areas of Concern**

- The lightweight plastic used for parts like the juicing screen raises some longevity concerns. While they haven’t failed me yet, I do wonder how they’ll hold up after a year or two of heavy use.  
- It’s not the most compact design out there. At nearly 19 inches in depth, finding counter space might be difficult in smaller kitchens.  

**Peer Products**

Comparing this to some other masticating juicers I've tried, the Omega NC900HRD19 wins in versatility. For example, models like the Hurom H-AA, while efficient in juicing, don’t offer the same range when it comes to creating nut butters or grinding coffee. That said, if sheer compactness and ultra-minimalist design are priorities, a Breville compact centrifugal juicer may be a better option, but you'll miss out on the low-speed nutrient-preserving benefits that the Omega provides.

**Affordable Quality**

Taking everything into account, the Omega NC900HRD19 delivers solid value for what you're getting. The 15-year warranty on parts and performance is an incredible reassurance, making it feel less like a risky splurge and more like a long-term investment in your health. Although it’s on the pricier side compared to some entry-level juicers, it really does pull its weight with superior juice yield, nutritional retention, and multi-purpose use.

It’s probably going to be long. 

A few years ago, I met this guy, Zach (fake name) when I was on Tinder. He was really funny, smart, handsome, nerdy and kind. I thought we hit it off from the moment we started talking. We had great banter, amazing chemistry, I felt sparks every time I saw him. He would stay with me for a few days at a time, partly because he travelled a while to come see me but also because for me it just felt natural us being together. Note that I had never been to his place. 

At the start, we had said we weren’t looking for commitment at the time, we had both been screwed over by ex’s and wanted time for ourselves. We agreed we were okay with seeing other people but one night on a call Zach said it made him uncomfortable thinking about me with someone else. We had been seeing each other for a while and so I told him I’ll drop the other people and he said he hadn’t seen anyone else. I thought that maybe things would progress with us. 

This one night Zach didn’t pick up my call and I thought it was weird and texted to check on him. A day went by and nothing, then another… it took me a few days to realise that he wasn’t going to message me again and I was honestly devastated. It had been over a 1yr since things ended with my ex (awful, toxic relationship for 4 years) and I thought, maybe I’d get to be with someone who actually seemed to enjoy being around me for me. 

I spent a few weeks in a bad place because of a bunch of things in my life. I got back on tinder and tried finding what I had with Zach in other people. A few months later and I had been seeing this guy when I get a message from Zach. We started talking again and things felt off but I missed him so much I excused everything. Before I knew it, he was gone again. 

Over the next year and I met a different guy (E), things were good for a few months, he had been diagnosed with BPD and it made him panic but I reassured him that it wouldn’t change how I felt. I decided when my lease ended to move closer to work and him. E said he’d look after some of my things and my pet but the day before I move he dumped me once he’s got my pet. He said it was temporary and I could come see my pet and still leave some stuff there so it was easier on me until I was back on my feet. 

E told me he needed time to figure some things out and couldn’t see me, he was going out and doing substances. He called me drunk one night saying he had hurt his friend and needed me to just stay with him because he was upset and alone. I told him it scared me being around him like that and he begged, so I went and stayed with him. That night was the last time I saw him or spoke to him because he stopped responding to me. 

My car broke down and I spent months alone, depressed and isolated from everyone. I had seen Zach at one point and we spent a night together, he had changed so much. He apologised sincerely for ghosting me and said he wished he’d never hurt me but didn’t really tell me anything was going on. He kept apologising and I started crying because I knew it was going to happen. And then… you guessed it. 

A few months later I was at my teams Christmas party and one of my friends and I decided to go clubbing. We were at one of my favourite bars and I had a drunken conversation with someone (G). He and I exchanged socials and then I went off to enjoy my night with my friend. He and I talked for a bit and we started seeing each other. He had been calling me his girlfriend to his friends and family (based off what he told me.) It got to the point where I said “you can’t keep calling me that without asking” and so he did. 

We were dating for about 3-4 months in which I had to move house twice. He didn’t treat me great but I put it down to him only having one relationship from high school and him being a “quiet nerd type”. At one point he called me and my family white trash (not entirely wrong but still hurtful) and said other words about me not being as smart (I didn’t study after school). It seemed off for a few weeks and one night at his apartment we were in bed and I got upset and told him it was for how he’d treated me. He said “we’re on different frequencies” and we broke up. There was a massive storm coming so I went home and told him to just be safe. 

That morning the storm was starting to hit and I got a message (while I was asleep) from an unsaved number telling me to be safe. I knew who it was even though it had been months and I had deleted him on everything. I decided eff it, I’m going to get ghosted anyway, he always comes back when something is going wrong in my life. Zach and I started talking, a lot… almost constantly, that turned into calls, jokes again, everything it started out with. I kept telling myself I won’t get attached because he’s going to ghost me again. 

Zach explained a lot about what had happened when he stopped talking to me those times. Grief, his friends telling him to leave me alone, his own insecurity. He apologised so much and told me there will never be enough he can do to make up for it all. He knew he hurt me but everytime it hurt him too but he’d rather let me go than drag me down further. Zach had kept what I had given him and I had kept what he gave me. I told him I was scared and he said he was too but he wanted to try. 

The night drives and going to get coffee together were more frequent, and then almost daily. I had come over to his place multiple times a week and just hung out talking or driving. Then one afternoon he calls and asked if I wanted to meet his sister and her partner and we all have dinner together. I met his housemates and friends and we would all hang out and talk but I kept telling myself that he’ll go again and I can’t be hurt this time. 

I ended up getting sick and not being able to work for a week, he spent the whole time with me and one night we went to the beach because I wanted out of the house. We got back after a nice night and he looked at me. He ended up telling me he loved me. My heart was racing but felt so hurt at the same time. I spent weeks expecting this man to leave me again and he’s saying this? He said he wants to ask me out properly on a nice fancy date, so it’s “the one thing he can do right for me and us”. 

I now have so many wonderful memories with this man and his family and get to make so many more with him. His sister told me she is happy for us I gave him another chance even when he probably didn’t deserve it, she said if we had tried back then we would have hurt each other. His family and friends have made comments to us about how we are basically married now. We live together, cook together, go out together. He is patient and reassures me when I need it. I love him and cherish it all.  

I know allowing him back was silly and my friends are/were not happy about it but they’ve also seen the change. I’d like to hear if anyone else has been through this or similar and just see how that went for you.

Vietnam, the world’s second-largest exporter of coffee, is known for growing robusta beans. Earthier and more bitter than the arabica beans grown in Brazil, Colombia, and other coffee-growing regions near the Equator, robusta beans are often thought of as producing lower-quality coffee. 

In an effort to rebrand robusta, Mullin signed deals with coffee farming cooperatives in Vietnam and created smooth blends. Over the years, she helped a cohort of farmers convert their operations to organic. “We put in huge investments and were certified as the first organic specialty-grade coffee farms ever in Vietnam,” said the CEO and founder.

1mqvs0e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mqvs0e,Resenha: bases top beauty e top coat Colorama,"Inicialmente, acho que as bases da top beauty nem precisam de afirmação pois já são muito reconhecidas.

Comprei a fermento ativa, concreto, D-tone e xi lascou. Tenho utilizado há um mês, alternando entre elas e o resultado me surpreendeu muito.

Minha unha é muito fina, tipo um papel. Uma profissional de alongamento já contra recomendou que eu fizesse alongamento por conta da unha ser muito frágil e poder gerar algum dano grave por conta de acidente e até do desgaste do procedimento.

Mostrei a última foto o crescimento da unha atualmente. Antes, nem em dois meses eu conseguia esse resultado, pois além do crescimento lento, ainda quebrava com muita facilidade. Estou há um mês sem quebras!

Agora, passando pra o top coat da Colorama. Essas fotos acabaram de ser tiradas, fiz a unha na segunda, sigo vivendo normalmente, lavando prato (não usei luvas), lavando cabelo, arrumando a casa. 

Me surpreende a durabilidade do esmalte com o top coat da Colorama, quero um estoque dele kkkk nas primeiras vezes, achei que ele puxava o esmalte, não sei se era pq eu fazia misturinhas. Como essa esmaltação só usei o coffee da Impala, não senti essa puxadinha que rolava das outras vezes.

Mas em questão de durabilidade da esmaltação, é uma coisa absurda.

A few days ago I was at Starbucks telling a friend about my latest side project, [vibecodingideas.io](https://vibecodingideas.io). It’s a place where you can find easy project ideas inspired by Reddit posts that are quick to build and ship.

He started suggesting ways to improve it. One idea stood out: Adding live hosted preview sites for each idea, so people could instantly see and interact with a working version instead of just reading the name and description.

I said “nice, but I don’t have the time or even know where to start.” He replied, “Hold on a minute, just get me a Venti Iced Latte.”

Right there, he pulled out his laptop and vibecoded an API that takes each idea and instantly spins up a live hosted preview. Suddenly, instead of imagining an idea, you could click and see it in action.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and design of a Hello Kitty t-shirt determine its appeal and longevity. Understanding the key features will help you choose a shirt that not only looks good but also feels cozy and lasts through countless washes.

**Material Composition:** A high-quality Hello Kitty t-shirt should ideally be made from 100% cotton or a cotton blend. Cotton offers breathability and comfort, while blends often incorporate polyester for added durability and wrinkle resistance. Higher quality cotton, such as ring-spun cotton or Pima cotton, will feel softer and more luxurious against the skin. Avoid shirts primarily made from synthetic materials like polyester or rayon,as these can be less breathable and uncomfortable to wear for extended periods.

The material composition significantly impacts the shirt's feel and how well it drapes. Look for shirts that specify the type of cotton used and the percentage of each material in the blend.Understanding this data is crucial for ensuring both comfort and durability.

**Print quality:** The graphic of Hello Kitty herself is paramount. Screen printing, direct-to-garment (DTG) printing, and heat transfer are common methods. Screen printing offers vibrant colors and excellent durability, making it suitable for designs with fewer colors. DTG printing allows for complex designs with many colors and gradients. Heat transfer, while less durable, can be cost-effective for smaller quantities. Look for prints that are sharp,clear,and resistant to fading or cracking after washing.

Examine the details of the Hello Kitty graphic, paying attention to the sharpness of the lines and the vibrancy of the colors. A high-quality print will maintain its integrity even after multiple washes, ensuring that your Hello Kitty t-shirt remains a cherished part of your wardrobe for years to come.

**Fit and Sizing:** Hello kitty t-shirts come in various fits, including classic, slim-fit, and oversized. Classic fit offers a relaxed silhouette, while slim-fit provides a more tailored look. Oversized t-shirts are trendy and comfortable, perfect for casual wear. Ensure the sizing is accurate by consulting the manufacturer's size chart and reading customer reviews regarding fit. Consider your body type and personal preference when choosing the right size and fit.

A well-fitting t-shirt will enhance your comfort and confidence. Before making a purchase, measure your chest, waist, and hips and compare them to the size chart provided by the manufacturer. Keep in mind that sizing can vary between brands, so it's always a good idea to double-check the measurements.

**Seam Construction:** The quality of the seams is a crucial indicator of the t-shirt’s overall construction. Look for reinforced seams,especially at the shoulders,neckline,and armholes. These areas are prone to stress and wear, so strong seams will prevent tearing and unraveling. Double-needle stitching is a sign of superior construction and adds to the shirt’s durability.

Examine the seams closely, both on the inside and outside of the t-shirt. Make sure they are straight,even,and free from loose threads. Reinforced seams indicate that the manufacturer has paid attention to detail and is committed to producing a high-quality product.

**Neckline Design:** The neckline design can significantly impact the t-shirt's style and comfort. Common neckline options include crew neck, v-neck, and scoop neck. Crew neck is classic and versatile, while v-neck elongates the neck and adds a touch of femininity. Scoop neck offers a more relaxed and comfortable feel. Choose a neckline that complements your personal style and body shape.

Consider the shape of your face and neck when selecting a neckline design. A crew neck can make a round face appear rounder, while a v-neck can help to balance out a wider face. Experiment with different necklines to find the one that flatters you the most.**Licensed Product versus Inspired Design:** Ensure you are purchasing an officially licensed Hello Kitty product. Licensed merchandise typically has better quality control and adherence to Sanrio's branding guidelines. Unlicensed or ""inspired"" designs may feature lower-quality materials, inaccurate graphics, and poor construction. Look for the official Sanrio logo or licensing information on the product label.

Supporting licensed products ensures that the creators and owners of the Hello kitty brand are properly compensated for thier intellectual property. It also guarantees that the product meets certain quality standards and is safe for consumers.

So many people believe we cause problems for them, (and more so us), intentionally just to mess with them…for what reason? 

Some examples:

Work has a free self serve beverage offer on a holiday. Like an hour and a half into my shift the cappuccino machine that’s been abused all day just stops working. Supervisor attempts to fix it for about a half hour then just turns it off and puts a sign out. So many nasty old bats telling us how awfully convenient that is and we must feel proud of how we’re “saving money for the company.” Yes, we turned it off because we wanted to be belittled on free coffee day for 8 hours.

We have a hot cart during lunch hours that gets refilled when possible but usually only has a few premade pizzas and sandwiches on it. It’s inconsistent to begin with but sometimes we run out of product or are too damn busy in the kitchen with live orders to prepare them. I was working checkout the one day my team in the back were getting blasted and some man came up to ask me why I haven’t made hot cart food. I explained I could ask them to throw something in for him, they’re just a little backed up. He said he didn’t feel like waiting and that he was “shocked”, just absolutely shocked, we didn’t have any prepped. How mind blowing. Truly impressive. Walked away shaking his head like this is going to cause the earth to stop spinning on its axis. 

The power goes out one day so we can’t run kitchen equipment. My coworker and I are at one of the cold cases packing up perishable food to get it moved into the cooler before it can spoil. A woman and her daughter come in and we go into the spiel about how we currently can’t make food and are very limited on what we can sell, but the bathrooms are still open, just please take this flashlight. They wanted to order something. After peeing like a pioneer the woman comes out and says something like, “I find it so funny that the power is out yet your automatic toilet still flushes.” I think my face looked like a low res Sim’s at that point because I was so over it. I don’t even remember what we said but I commented to my coworker when they left about the emergency lights being on, us having to deconstruct the salesfloor, and the bathroom lights not working but yes, we are lying about being without power. We want the day to be difficult so they can’t get their milkshakes. 

Making new drinks for a woman’s child and he hates it and starts throwing a fit? She demands a manager and says they deserve a free classic because “he don’t like it”. How dare you treat customers this way and say no 😭

1mqvltx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartInvestorTools/comments/1mqvltx/5_reasons_why_keeping_money_in_savings_accounts/,5 Reasons Why Keeping Money in Savings Accounts is Actually Risky (And Why Investing Isn't Optional Anymore),"Welcome to our first deep-dive, the reason why investing matters! I'm excited to kick off this community with something fundamental that affects every financial decision we make - why investing has become essential, not optional.

I want to start my first topic related post with this, because it's where the ""why"" behind all our tools and strategies begins. Here is my non-exhaustive list of reasons why the investment topic is important to me (besides my intrinsic interest in it):

**Reason 1: Inflation is stealing your purchasing power**
Your $10,000 in savings earning 0.5% becomes $10,050 after a year. But if inflation runs at 3%, you need $10,300 just to buy the same stuff. You're effectively losing $250 in purchasing power annually. Over 10 years? That ""safe"" $10,000 can only buy what $7,400 could today.

Real example: A $4 coffee in 2010 costs $5.50 today. Your savings rate didn't keep up, but the S&P 500 returned 250% in the same period.

**Reason 2: You're selling your life energy for future security**
Every hour you work, you're trading time for money. But if that money sits stagnant, you're essentially working extra years to maintain the same lifestyle. Investing lets your past work hours compound and work for you.

Math check: $500/month invested at 7% annual returns becomes $525,000 over 30 years. In savings at 1%? Only $197,000. That's 13 extra years of working vs. retiring earlier.

**Reason 3: Economic participation vs. being left behind**
Companies grow, create value, and distribute profits to shareholders. Keeping money in cash means you're financing the system (through bank loans to businesses) but not participating in the upside.

Meanwhile, asset owners benefit from productivity gains, technological advances, and global economic growth. The wealth gap isn't just about income - it's about who owns productive assets.

**Reason 4: Protection against currency debasement**
Governments can print money, but they can't print companies, real estate, or commodities. When currency supply increases faster than economic output, asset prices rise.

Historical perspective: Since 1971 (end of gold standard), the dollar has lost >80% of its purchasing power. But owning shares of productive businesses provided protection because companies adjust prices and costs with inflation.

**Reason 5: Optionality and financial independence**
Investments create choices. Having a portfolio means you can:
- Take career risks (start a business, change fields)
- Handle emergencies without debt
- You can retire early, not when you have to
- Support causes you care about
- Leave something meaningful for the next generation

The goal isn't getting rich quick - it's building sustainable wealth that compounds over decades.

**The meta-point**: ""Safe"" money in savings accounts carries the hidden risk of guaranteed purchasing power loss. Smart long-term investing is actually the conservative choice for long-term wealth preservation.

What are your reasons for being interested in investing? Can you add to the list?

1mqvles,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1mqvles/inlaws_said_i_need_to_grow_up/,Inlaws said I need to grow up,"I'm sorry english is not my first language but I needed to vent after this :(

Apparently my (24f) bfs (26m) family said that they are worried because he is living with a ""stranger"" (we've been living together since february and had been dating for 4 years). 
When I asked my bf what they meant by that he explained that they are worried because ""they don't know me"" as I don't open up to them. 
They are a really close family, all extroverted, they facetime each other every single day and they do gatherings EVERY sunday that feel like a competition of who can talk the loudest. When my bf told me what happened I was shocked bc I've been making a huge effort going to every single gathering (once I said I had plans and they looked offended) I even went to a random birthday a week before submitting my thesis!!!!! I see them more than my own family!!
My family is close but we are not used to doing lots of gatherings, we have our own dynamics and I feel like my inlaws just want to push me into their extroverted-family-lifestyle.
What hurt me the most was that my bf told me that they were offended as I don't open up about myself, they said that even my MIL was quiet when she met her husbands family but then she managed to open up, so ""I need to grow up"".
I'm a really introverted person and I have struggled a lot with social anxiety growing up. I had close friends say to my face that I'm too boring and quiet, which left some damage that I'm still healing with therapy.
When we get together I always try to join the conversation but most of the time they are chatting about their own things or the family bussiness. When someone talks to me is the usual ""how are your parents?"" ""hows your career?"". I even thought that I had made lots of progress with them and that I finally was comfortable speaking up... When theres lots of people I get overwhelmed and tend to think that everyone is probably talking about how quiet I am, and now that they proved my point it just hurts a lot.
I talked to my bf and explained that I can't give them a DIL that facetimes every day and invites them for coffee 3 times a week. I enjoy a little chat but I can't handle a group of 8 extroverts going crazy every day, I don't want to act as an outgoing person and talk politics and local news with them because that's not me!
My bf understands since he's known me for a long time and has seen me in similar situations. What scares me is my inlaws... At first they were okay with me being shy but now they obviously think I'm rude and childish. I don't want to see them for a long time and I don't know if can look at them in the same way as before :(

I’ve been comfortable in my own skin ever since I began sleeping naked when I was younger, and home ownership just gave me the space and freedom to make it a daily lifestyle. There’s something incredibly freeing about enjoying my morning coffee out on the back deck (weather permitting) in nothing but my birthday suit, or moving through a peaceful yoga session without a single layer of fabric. It’s a small part of everyday life that brings a surprisingly big sense of peace and confidence.

I’m hesitant to write this and say I’ve found a solution, especially after only a day and a half without symptoms, but here goes.

I’m male, 38, and have had irregular PVCs for 7 years. It started one evening at my PC with a sudden sharp pain in my chest, like a needle or knife, lasting just a second. From then on I spiraled into constant fear of dying from a stroke or heart failure. I was a smoker, slightly overweight, and sitting all day in IT.

Over the years I felt my pulse in my chest, head, gums, back, and legs. Sometimes the chest pain returned, sometimes numb, sometimes sharp. I also belched and passed gas a lot, which I thought was normal, until I noticed symptoms got worse when I was full. My heart would race after normal meals and I always felt overly full.

I saw a GI doctor who said everything was fine. That felt like bad news because then it must be my heart, right? A cardiologist checked me and said my heart was 100% healthy. I still spiraled. I even wondered if it was muscle related and started working out despite the fear.

I stopped smoking, lost 30 kg, cut coffee, and ate healthier. Great for my health, but the symptoms stayed. I stopped going to doctors and began testing myself. I noticed my heart would flutter when I bent over and took deep breaths, but only if I was full or had reflux.

A few weeks ago I read on the GERD subreddit that kefir and sauerkraut help reflux. Kefir did nothing, sauerkraut helped a bit but not enough. Then I learned that an imbalanced microbiome could cause symptoms like mine. I found a supplement called Probaflor MAX SPEKTRUM N95 from a German company.

I took the first dose yesterday and within hours everything went away. No reflux, no belching, no gas, no fluttering. For the first time in seven years, I did not feel my pulse throughout my whole body while lying in bed.

TLDR**:** Had PVCs, reflux, and weird body-wide pulse sensations for 7 years. Heart and stomach tests were fine. Lifestyle changes improved health but not symptoms. Tried a probiotic supplement for microbiome balance and within hours all symptoms disappeared.

1mqvekp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mqvekp,"Canadian trip, part 3: Jasper - Vancouver","Hi everyone! I took the Canadian in three parts this July, and I've already posted about part one and two of my trip in this sub. Here are the links to my first two reports if you're interested:  
[Toronto - Winnipeg](https://www.reddit.com/r/ViaRail/comments/1m3jyui/canadian_trip_part_1_torontowinnipeg/)  
[Winnipeg - Edmonton](https://www.reddit.com/r/ViaRail/comments/1m8ns5d/canadian_trip_part_2_winnipeg_edmonton/)

I'm back home in Switzerland now and after beating the mother of all jet lags (are they meant to get worse every time?) I've finally come around to finishing part 3.

*Wednesday, July 30th*

After a week of driving and hiking through the Canadian Rockies, it's finally train time again. The Rockies are absolutely gorgeous of course, and even though I would have loved to experience arriving there by train, I think it was a good decision to skip the Edmonton - Jasper part in favor of a one-week road trip. We saw a bear, wapiti, and 500-million-year-old fossils, which was exciting to say the least. But now we're almost as excited to get back on the Canadian for the last time. 

The train is supposed to arrive at 6.30 am and leave at 9.30 am, but when we take the short walk from our accommodation to the train station at 8.30, we already know that the train hasn't even arrived yet. It's no problem. We check in, hand over our huge backpacks to checked luggage (always a relief), and leave the station to get some breakfast at a bakery. If you're ever in Jasper, Bear's Paw Bakery has fantastic almond croissants, and I'm saying this as an almond croissant aficionado, and my partner swears their raspberry and white chocolate scone is the best she's ever had. 

We're back at the station shortly after 9, in time to see the train arrive, and we're told we can expect boarding in about an hour. It's funny how I hate train delays back home, but here, I don't mind much. Jasper's train station is not a bad place to wait. It's a nice building, with a very 50s/60s looking hall. Also, there is a bear? 

As we wait to board, we join the queue for dinner reservations. On the first two legs of our train trip we've learned that we prefer the last seating, because it's the most quiet and relaxed. First and second can be noisy and rushed. However, we're told by the service manager, Julie, that she's not sure there will be a third seating. She gives us second but tells us she will come find us in case there is a third. Sure enough, half an hour later she comes running and switches our second seating reservation for a third seating one. That's the kind of customer service that makes the trips on the Canadian so exceptional: people really go above and beyond to look after you and accommodate your wishes if possible. 

At 10.30, a line starts to build outside the station and because we mistake it for a sign that we're about to board, we join it. Nothing happens for half an hour as we stand in the sun, but we're in a misery of our own making, as there is really no reason to wait in line, so we don't complain. I don't want to go wait somewhere else because I enjoy people watching so much here. There are a lot of families who aren't traveling in sleeper class because many of them are only going to Kamloops, where we will arrive in the evening. Most of them are Canadian families who have been spending some time in Jasper. I envy them for having the Rockies so close that they can do short-ish trips there if they feel like it. Then again, I can be on a choice of mountains in 20 minutes from where I live, which I guess isn't too bad either.

We board the train shortly after 11 am. We have Berths 3 U and L in car 16, just like we did from Toronto to Winnipeg. Later, we're going to find out that it's actually the exact same train we took on our first leg. It's a detail, but a nice one. As we leave Jasper, we can see a bit of the devastation last year's wildfires caused in and around the town. We saw the extent of it as we drove to our hikes the days before, and it's an eerie sight, miles and miles of burnt-down trees. I can't imagine how terrifying this must have been for those living here. It looks worse on the other side of town. Northwest, where we're heading, the forests soon turn lush and green again.

There is brunch instead of lunch today, and it opens around 12. Just like breakfast, there is no reservation, so people are in a rush to get either there or to the dome car to get good views of the Rockies. Having had a good breakfast and four 15-22km hikes in the last 6 days with incredible views, we are not, and we go to the activity instead car to grab some coffee. Champagne is served, which is a nice plus, and we idly watch mountains, forests, rivers and lakes for some time. Theo, the activity coordinator, tells us to go to brunch at around 1pm. There are great options: French toast, Eggs Benedict, omelettes, a tofu bowl, and some options I probably forgot. My partner has the tofu bowl, I get the Eggs Benedict, and they're amazing, so amazing in fact that I completely forgot to take a picture.

After brunch, we head to the dome after all. We listen to our respective audio books, drink coffee and hot chocolate, and watch as we slowly leave the Rockies behind. We still drive through mountains and valleys, but they're a bit gentler now, more hill-like. What doesn't change the entire trip to Vancouver is that the train follows a river. Even looking at a map now, I'm not quite sure about the geography of it all, but I think it's Fraser River for a while, then Thompson River, then Fraser river again from somewhere after Kamloops until we arrive at Vancouver. It's beautiful to look at.

My partner heads to the more spacious seats downstairs after a while, but I stay in the dome and get into a conversation with a person from Vancouver. They give me a lot of tips for the city and know some interesting stories about its recent history. They happen to be an old friend of Theo, the activity coordinator, and they met each other again on the train after over 10 years. Canada, for all its vastness, seems to be a small world sometimes. Theo joins our conversation after a while, as does my partner, and an older gentleman from Nashville called Marvin, who is writing a story about a ghost (though not a ghost story, as he keeps reminding us). It's probably the most enjoyable time I've had on the train, just talking to interesting people and hearing their stories. As it does when you're having fun, the afternoon passes in the blink of an eye, and before we know it, the sun sets over the dome car and the valley we're currently driving through, which in the dim evening light even includes a bald eagle perched on a tree trunk in the middle of a river. 

Our dinner seating is called at 9 pm. I have the salad and the chicken breast, my partner has the soup (I think it's butternut squash) and the stuffed pepper. It's amazing as always. It's quiet and comfortable in the dinner car, and we get lost in conversation with the people opposite us, so it takes us a while to eat. It's clear that the staff only have to wait for us to finish so they can clean up and finish for the day, but even so, they try to convince us to have dessert and coffee. Again, staff on this train are amazing. We still decline, though, simply because we're full.

It's almost 11pm when I finally climb into my cozy lower berth. Not a bad bedtime, but because it's my last time on the Canadian, I want to make the most of enjoying my beloved early mornings on the train. So I set the alarm for 5am and let the rocking of the train lull me to sleep.

  
*Thursday, July 31st*

I wake up shortly before the alarm rings. In what has become a beloved routine on the last two trips, I get dressed, get a coffee from the activity car, and head to the dome car. Both the valley and Fraser River right next to the train are wider now, calmer and quiet. We're somewhere between Chilliwack and Abbotsford, and there is evidence of somewhat denser population now: Ships (and a shipwreck), commercial forestry and paths along the river, but everything is still peaceful. On the train, though, people are up earlier today, and the dome fills up sooner, probably because we're supposed to arrive in Vancouver at 8am and everyone is of course getting off there. I get a hot chocolate and head back to my berth, enjoying the quiet and the views from there until my partner joins me at 7.30. We head to breakfast and have to wait 15 minutes in the activity car because the dining car is full. In the meantime, we're approaching the outskirts of Vancouver. At breakfast (transcontinental with eggs, bacon/veggie bacon, and hash browns for both of us), we're told that we'll be arriving with a 90-minute delay. Not too bad. We're not stressed about it because our only plan for today is the Vancouver Aquarium (for the otters) and a hop-on-hop-off bus, because we haven't done enough sitting and watching, apparently.

Even with the delay, time flies and we barely have time to talk to all of our new friends before we arrive at Vancouver Pacific Central Station. We say goodbye to everyone, tip the staff, and then we leave the train for the last time. It's kinda sad, knowing that I won't get to do this trip again, at least for a while. We're already planning another trip to Canada in about four years, but we want to explore the east coast.

There is a 45-minute wait for the luggage, which is kind of annoying, but at least we have time to explore the beautiful station hall. After that, we leave the train station behind, and with it the best train trip either of us has had. 

So, that's it. It's over, and it feels kind of weird. I've spent the best part of the last 18 months preparing, planning, and booking, and now I have to get a new hobby. Or plan a new trip. Before I leave you guys alone, however, here's some tips I have for anyone planning on doing the Canadian in future:

\- Consider doing it in sections, especially if you're younger and/or not from Canada. You see a lot from the train, but you only see it. Getting off at Winnipeg and Edmonton gave us the chance to stop and explore the country for a bit. Of course, hiking in the Rockies was a highlight, but Winnipeg, too, was worth experiencing for a few days. Also, as great as the staff, the food and the activities are, I think I'd get stir crazy if I was on the train for four days. There is a kind of routine you settle into with the meal seatings and the activities, and I think I would have found that almost stressful if I'd had it for more than 36 hours.

\- If you're sensitive to loud noise, third seating is the best. Yes, you eat later, but there's always free snacks if you get hungry, and the dinner car is so much quieter. Also, even if the dome is full, people leave for first or second seating, so you have the chance to go up there.

\- The berths are an amazing option, and after looking at the single and double cabins, I think I prefer them over the more expensive options. They're much less claustrophobic, and with the curtains, you get a lot of privacy. Even noise wise, I didn't hear anything from the other berths at night. If you want a bit more privacy, take berth 3 U and/or L. They have no neighbors.

\- Talk to people. This will happen automatically, because you have your meals seated with strangers. I find it difficult to get talking to strangers, but this arrangement made it easy for me, and the conversations were always pleasant and interesting. We met so many interesting people from all walks of life.

\- Also, consider bringing compression socks, because you will be sitting a lot. I'd never have thought of that for a train trip, but I had mine with me because of the flight to Canada, and they were a godsend.

\- Tip your staff. They're amazing.

Alright, that's it from me. I'll go back to lurking in this sub and reading other people's trip reports, like I did before my trip. Bye! 

P.S.: If anyone plans a trip to Switzerland or Europe in general, message me. I know some great train trips on this side of the Atlantic, too. But I'm afraid none of them will ever come close to the Canadian.

1mqvciu,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCCruises/comments/1mqvciu/seashore_review_first_time_trying_msc/,Seashore Review – First Time Trying MSC,"We recently returned from our first MSC cruise, and overall, we had a fantastic experience. This was my 29th cruise, and after years of sailing with Royal Caribbean, Celebrity, etc, I wanted to try something different. We booked a 4-night sailing out of Port Canaveral with stops in Nassau and Ocean Cay. While a few areas could use improvement, I think MSC offers a strong product — and I would happily book again.

**Embarkation**

For us, embarkation was a bit of a mess. It took about 90 minutes from drop-off to stepping onboard, with nearly half that time spent outside in 90+ degree heat. We arrived at 12:00p for an assigned 11:30a boarding time and didn’t board until 1:30p— not exactly the ideal way to start a vacation.

**Ship**

The *Seashore* has the most modern design of any ship I’ve sailed, which I really enjoyed. The layout was a bit confusing at first, but like most ships, we figured it out by day two.

Our favorite spot was the aft adults-only pool, where we enjoyed great views and a relaxing atmosphere. We also spent a good amount of time in the casino, which offered $10 and $15 blackjack tables. Finding a seat was never a problem, and the dealers were friendly. One noticeable issue was the temperature — the ship felt warmer than expected in many indoor spaces, including our cabin. Public restrooms were limited, and the unisex bathrooms were… let’s just say, different. The elevators were slow during peak times, though that’s fairly standard on most cruises.

**Cabin**

We stayed in a standard balcony cabin on Deck 9 and found it comfortable and well laid out. The shower design made it feel slightly smaller than on other ships, though still manageable. The balcony was great, and we spent many evenings out there with a drink, enjoying the view — one of my favorite parts of any cruise. Like the public areas, the cabin stayed warmer than we’d prefer, even with the thermostat set to its lowest setting.

**Drinks**

We purchased the drink package before sailing (\~$40/day) and found it to be an excellent value. The included selections were top-notch for a cruise, far better than what Royal/Celebrity offers. As a bourbon drinker, having Maker’s Mark and Woodford Reserve available at every bar was great.  The ship’s coffee was another standout and nearly every bar had a coffee machine. All coffee and non-alcoholic drinks (including Red Bull) were included in the package as well. The 15-drink daily limit only applies to alcoholic beverages; coffee, bottled water, sodas, and other non-alcoholic drinks don’t count toward the total.

**Service**

Service was consistently great throughout the ship. Every bartender and server we encountered was friendly, professional, and quick with a smile. Special mention to the aft pool bartenders — they made for some fun afternoons.

**Ocean Cay**

Ocean Cay was simply beautiful- we ended up finding a quiet swim area with some of the clearest water I’ve ever seen. There were plenty of chairs on the island, though MSC charges for loungers and umbrellas in area we swam near (we heard there are free chairs elsewhere on the island).  There are multiple bars and the buffet offered a great lunch. The island itself is peaceful, clean, and perfect for relaxing.

**Food**

Food quality was a pleasant surprise — in my opinion, it was on par with, if not slightly better than, Royal Caribbean. Instead of one main dining room like we’re used to, *Seashore* has 3 smaller dining rooms. We signed up for late seating which we thought was 7:45p, but our dining time turned out to be 9:45p which was too late for our group.  The dining reservations team couldn’t adjust it for the first night but starting on day two we were moved to an 8:00 p.m. seating in a different dining room, which worked well.  The main dining room food was very good, but MSC doesn’t seem to encourage ordering multiple appetizers or entrées the way other lines do. For breakfast and lunch, the main alternative to the MDR was the buffet, which felt cramped especially at peak times — possibly due to its nontraditional layout and lower ceilings. That said, most of the food we tried in the buffet, including the pizza, was excellent.

**Disembarkation**

Opposite from our embarkation, this was very quick and efficient and we were outside of the terminal 10 minutes after we left breakfast in the dining room. 

**Additional Notes**

* The Wi-Fi package worked well enough for browsing and social media, but iMessage was spotty at times, leading to a few “Where Are You?” scavenger hunts all over the ship — which made us laugh and reminded us of cruising in the pre-internet days.
* Our Ocean Cay departure wasn’t until midnight, which was fantastic. We didn’t attend the “Cigars Under the Stars” event at the Lighthouse Bar, but we did enjoy a cigar and a drink at the Brooklyn Bar’s outdoor smoking area while watching the 10 p.m. Lighthouse light show — one of the highlights of the trip.

**Final Thoughts**  
This cruise exceeded my expectations. The *Seashore* is a beautiful, modern ship with excellent drink options, friendly service, and a stunning private island. While embarkation, indoor temperatures, and buffet crowding could be improved, the overall experience was so enjoyable that I’m already looking forward to booking with MSC again.

I woke up today with $15 in my checking account, barely enough for coffee. By dinner? I had made **$100**. And ALL I did was use my phone to test random apps.

I KNOW — I’m as skeptical as you. I literally thought these stories were all a scam or, at best, a clickbait joke.

But real talk, something wild happened today, and I still can’t process it. You ever find yourself questioning REALITY because you made more money sitting in pajamas than you would clocking in at a “real” job?

Here’s the deal — step by step breakdown — so you can check my math (or maybe prove I’m in The Matrix):
  
---
  
**How I Did It:**

- Woke up, drank coffee, checked my random Reddit feeds (shoutout r/beermoney).
- Saw everyone talking about this ""**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**"" site. Like, obsessively.
- I opened my browser, not expecting anything (I mean… I’ve clicked on these before, right?).
- But this time… things felt easy? The sign-up was literally under THREE minutes. No sketchy crypto wallet drama. Just email & confirm.
- Got into the dashboard, and there were a bunch of app-testing gigs listed.
  
---

**Here’s where it got WILD:**

- Each app test promised **$3 to $20** for less than 15 minutes of “testing.”
  
- I picked a simple game. Had to play, rate the UI, and send two screenshots.
  
- Payment landed in my account instantly after each one.

- I started chaining these tasks. Math started mathing. In a little under five hours (like, after all the scrolling), I hit $100!!!

---

But I can’t be the only one shocked by this, right??  

Is the world shifting, or were we lied to about needing a 9-to-5…?

And, just for the doubters: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** — Go plug your phone in, click this, see it for yourself.

---

**Why I Think It Worked For Me:**

- The tasks were LEGIT — not those spammy survey farms.  
- No personal data panic. Just standard app feedback and some bug reporting.
- The interface? Super clean (like, app store vibes).
- Stable instant Paypal payment. Zero runaround.

If you’re tired of side hustle “hacks” giving you anxiety, this is honestly low pressure and kinda satisfying.

---

Look, I’m not saying you’ll retire rich.

But… if you need grocery cash or a weekend pizza fund, **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** is honestly the weird app goldmine hiding out in plain sight!

I wanna hear your stories if you try it!  
Anyone else low-key freaked out by how easy it is to bank $100 these days? Or did I land in the luck zone?? 😂

Let’s see some more *real* side hustle wins. Are there any other phone app gigs worth testing, or is **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** the peak??

1mqv6jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1mqv6jo/saving_face/,Saving Face,"I hear the bell again, pulling at my memories. How did I get here? I remember the sunlight cutting through the dusty window of our apartment, landing on Thura’s polished Oxfords. He leaned against the doorframe, effortless, while my mother fluttered around the cracked plastic kettle. My father wiped sweat from his brow, bowing to him.

“I plan to go to uni in the UK,” Thura said, examining a chipped teacup. “My parents paid for the best tuition teachers.” He placed the cup down without drinking. “But they teach the Myanmar way and I just don’t get it.”

My mother’s knuckles blanched on the kettle handle. “Khant works very hard, Ko Thura.”

“Heard your shop struggles,” Thura continued, eyes flicking to my father’s worn shirt cuffs. “Bad location. Expensive rent.” 

He smiled, “I need better marks. Physics. Calculus. Khant tutors me. My father... appreciates loyalty. Favors flow.”

Our cheap clock hammered out the seconds as mother pressed the teacup to her lips pretending to drink. Father nodded, weighing the realities of influential friends.

“Good merit. Good connections. Help Thura, son. Learn how the world works,” he rasped.

Thura’s hand clapped my shoulder. Cold, despite the heat. Heavy like a price tag.

“Friends now, right?” His smirk dawned, sharp as his eyes. “Show me how you get full shields and I’ll make you popular.”

The scent of gandamar drifted in, sharp in the flowerless room. My mother shivered, pouring tea that steamed like a ghost’s breath. I looked at Thura’s expensive watch, remembering how it glimmered the last time he flipped me off. 

“Yes,” I smiled. 

The word felt like swallowing glass. Thura’s smile widened. Father patted my knee. Relief warred with the hollowness in his gaze. The bell tolled, sharp against the teacup’s rattle like it cracked from the inside.

Glass shattered. A small shape crumpled against the grille, a street kid, fist full of jasmine garlands. Wet warmth sprayed the dashboard. Thura’s knuckles strained on the steering wheel. His breath hitched, sour with Johnny Walker.

“NO!” he whimpered, “My father’s going to kill me.” 

The engine roared. Tires squealed against the asphalt. We left the broken boy behind in the dark. My stomach clenched, a fist squeezing bile. 

“Do not tell anyone,” Thura hissed, eyes frantic in the dashboard’s glow. “My father will take care of it. Understand? Remember favors flow.”

He punched the accelerator. The city lights blurred into streaks of cold fire. The scent of crushed gandamar blossoms clung to the vents. The low timbre of the bell propelling us forward.

Mother’s hand shook, spilling lukewarm Sunday Coffee onto the cheap plastic. Father stared at a crack in the wall. Thura’s parents sat opposite, stiff in silk. Their lawyer, a sharp suit smelling of antiseptic, laid papers between the sticky rice bowls.

“Your son signs this,” the lawyer stated, “He admits driving. Takes the charge. Nothing to worry about, I know the law officer. He pays a fine. We compensate you. Generously.” 

He slid a thick envelope across the table. It landed beside a plate of drying tea leaf salad.

“For the family, Khant. For us. One day... you’ll understand,” father muttered, eyeing the envelope.

“Be the good son.” Mother touched my arm. “This family has a lot of power.”

I opened my mouth. I wanted to ask what happens after this?

The room emptied, colors smeared into grey.

Time passed. Or maybe not at all. The cold remains, like wearing the idea of a body. I drifted, remembering how it used to feel. The bell reverberated in the fog. I follow. Not because I knew where it led, but because I hoped for answers.

Guilty. No visits. No letters. Four years, a shiv and a choice. Mine, this time. For once.

“Can you get this letter to my family?” I passed the trustee my note.

Laughing, his breath reeked of stale fish sauce.

“Take it,” he growled, shoving loose cigarettes in my hand. “Say it's yours. Or I carve you.”

I shook my head.

His fist connected. Air exploded from my lungs. Concrete scraped my cheek. My ribs screamed. Blood filled my mouth, metallic and warm. The blue fabric of my prison shirt felt thin as paper. I remembered the small shape on the road. The envelope on the table. My father’s averted eyes. I pushed the cloth away. 

“No,” I blurted.

His fist rose, knuckles like stone. The shiv flickered.

Thunk... Thunk… Thunk…

I peeled the thin shirt from my ribs.

“No,” I gasped. 

The words sputtered on my lips. Mine this time.

Ding.

Another bell. This time it echoed down a hallway.

Shuffle... Shuffle... Drag... 

I hobbled along the empty corridor, like someone walking with a broken leg, holding invisible irons in my hands. Thura froze, his American sneakers silent on the polished teak. Goosebumps where the cold air prickled the back of his neck. He spun, gazing right through me. He peered down the long empty hall, the family portraits staring.

“Khant?” His voice echoed. “Is that you?”

Cold crept through me.

“Yes,” I smiled, “Thura? You remember me?”

The scent of gandamar overpowering the house’s lemon oil. Funeral flowers. 

“Impossible, he’s dead.” Thura backed towards his room. 

I limped closer across the silent teak floors. My blue paso faded under the LED lights. He ignored me as he played Mobile Legends. I wanted to talk, but my voice caught somewhere between my ribs and the silence. No breath moved it. Just the shape of a word that never arrived.

Ding.

I turned to the sound. Maybe someone else called.

“I assure you, Minister, the environmental report shows negligible impact. Profits outweigh…” Thura’s father's gloated as he signed the contract.

The signatures smeared. One line bled like the wounds on my chest. He scribbled my name, Khant. Thura’s father saw me standing over the minister’s shoulder. His finger pointed.

“Get it away!” He slammed back into his chair, arms flailing.

“Sir… I only wanted to ask about my family.” I blinked.

My whole being hinged on the answer. A single tether so I can rest knowing everything worked out. An antique jade Buddha shattered on the floor. His water glass overturned, soaking the contract. 

“The boy! Khant! He’s here!” 

The bell again, closer.

The minister stared, mouth agape. The room buzzed with muffled gasps. I reach, but the room tears away.

Thura’s mother admired the reflection. Raw silk, the color of ripe mango. She wears silk like a shield. Perfect. Worth a year of her maid’s salary. Turning, she adjusted the neckline.

I stood beside her. My prison shirt hung over my filthy blue paso. Movement shifted in the glass. Hollow sockets where eyes should be. Dark trickles tracing ribs. My lips parted.

“My mother loves that color.”

She shrieked like a caged animal as I pressed my palm to her spine.

“Wait,” I begged, confused.

She tore at the dress, stumbling back, ripping the delicate fabric. 

“Off! Get it off!” 

She burst through the curtain, half-naked, the ruined silk clutched like rags. Running for the exit, salesgirls gaped. Security stepped forward. 

“Thief!” someone yelled. 

Cameras flashed. Her face, contorted, filled the lens.

The bell rang louder than before. It throbbed like a heartbeat.

The Mercedes sped towards the police station. Thura’s mother huddled in the back seat, shivering under her shawl. His father stared ahead, tapping the armrest. 

“Idiot woman,” he muttered. “Costing millions over hysterics. That ghost nonsense...”

She noticed me first. Gandamar flooding the cabin in the deep marrow freezing cold. I sat beside her. Blood dripped from my ribs onto the leather. My eyes locked with hers. 

“Please,” I whispered, brushing her arm. “I just need to know. Is my family alright?” 

She shouted. Not hysterical. Primal. A sound ripped from the void. Her body arched.

Flinching, the driver snapped his head around. The wheel jerked. Tires shrieked. The guardrail crumpled like foil. Sky spinning blue and white swirls as the ground rushed up. Glass exploded inward. The scent of funeral flowers mixed with gasoline.

This time I waited. Waited for the ambulance. For the police. Told the witnesses what happened. But no one listened… Listened to Thura's garbled moans, when they pulled his parent’s bodies from the wreckage. I know the pain of losing a family. 

The scent of gandamar swelled.

1mqv6d7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mqv6d7/aitah_for_leaving_my_sister_in_and_her_kids_in_an/,AITAH for leaving my sister in and her kids in an abusive home?,"Trigger warning this story does contain self harm, abuse, and addiction. 

This is a bit of an old story it happen about two years ago but I still can’t stop thinking about all of it, My sister (F 26) at the time and I (F 21) at the time had decided to have me move in with her and her family because I was experiencing financial abuse at my fathers house because of my brother, long story short my brother would charge me up the butt for rent, steal money from me, and would tax me for “using his toilet paper” “eating his food” basically tried to milk money out of me. My dad wouldn’t say much because he is ill and the house is technically under my brothers name so he can’t really afford to get kicked out which I understood. 

Anyways one day my brother had taken my card and took all my money out of the bank, my code is my birthday which is how he got access, after that event I packed my things and called my sister to vent to her about what was going on and how I’m going to live in a shelter for a bit or figure out a plan, she didn’t like that so offered for me to move in with her, she has 3 kids and a partner in a two bedroom apartment, I asked if she was sure and that it would only be until I can get my own place and she said yes. Anyways I drove from Texas to South Carolina for 3 days, I did take breaks often during my drive to avoid falling asleep. Anyways everything was fine my first month, I got a job as a barista at a coffee shop, and my sisters bf was receiving unemployment, unexpectedly his parents were also staying there which she didn’t mention to me and my sister was a SAHM who would occasionally DoorDash, she has a son who’s 10 daughter who’s 3 and son who is 1. The two oldest kids shared a bunk bed with their grandparents in a bedroom, kids on top, grandparents on bottom. My sister and her bf shared the other room with their one year old and I got the living room couch. 

I had noticed that they were a pretty toxic couple, he was always mad that she wouldn’t baby him and help out financially but also didn’t want her to work because didn’t want other men looking at her, I don’t know… they were just really toxic. 
His parents were super weird, mom was always stealing my stuff and acted like she didn’t know what happened to my stuff until one day I found them in their room, don’t worry I hid her stuff as pay back and took my makeup back to throw it away in her face, not just toss, I mean completely destroy it and throw it away, yes I’m petty but this happened so much and one thing about me is I hate people lying in my face.  Her husband was a creep who was also schizophrenia and would take percs often. 

Anyways one day I had came home from work and decided to get on my PC, which I paid 2000 dollars for, I used to live stream on tiktok playing video games would get pretty good gifts because I did video games and asmr content. My sister had gotten home from door dashing and expressed how tired she was, the kids were also complaining about how they only ate once because dad didn’t make food for them and they had to figure it out. My sister was visibly upset so I went to go get us some Chinese food, I offered some to her bf but not his parents because they weren’t in the kitchen when I had came home. He saw my sisters plate of food and instantly became angry and expressed how he was mad that she didn’t come home to make his parents dinner. She then stated how they are grown adults who can fix their own plate and how she had been out all day. Side note they never cook only eat what me or my sister make and never offer to make food or buy groceries or pay rent, but they both work. 

My sisters bf then threw the plate across the room where it hit my niece in the face and she started crying because of the heat but he didn’t care about that, I grabbed her and instantly started trying to calm him down until he told me to shut the hell up and mind my business, and he swung at my sister. This is where I lost it , I instantly pushed his away from my sister and told him how pathetic he was for trying to raise his hand at a women especially while she’s holding his son, and how he’s an awful dad for what he did to his daughter. Anyways we exchange more words and started swinging at each other, his dad then grabs my hands from the back and my sisters bf tries to swing at me while I’m being held and I pushed back onto the dad hitting him against the wall and started hitting the son back, I also had nails on, his mom then calls the cops, he then proceeds to grab my computer equipment and stomp on it, punch the monitor in and poor beer on it, I instantly was shocked and my sister and I decided to cool off in my car with the baby and I tried grabbing my niece but they didn’t let me grab her just rushed us out the house. 

When cops got there they told me that he wanted to press charges but since he had previous charges to domestic abuse that they’ve decided this was self defense, as the officer was talking to us while we were in the car I can his his mom saying how I needed to be arrested. They they said we were no longer able to go into the home and sent us to a homeless shelter, my sister was able to get in because she had the baby with her but I couldn’t get a room for two weeks so I had to sleep in my car, mind you this was in January so it was very cold out. Finally my sister told me how we should go back home but that she wanted us to secretly look for an apartment and meet up with a lawyer. While we were at the shelter I gave her my card info so she couple buy anything necessary needed for the baby. When I finally arrived back at their house I checked my bank and noticed I only had 80 dollars, but I remember having about 1300 in my checking before we left for the shelter, when I asked her she said she needed it for gas and baby stuff and his medication, which I know was a lie because they were all atm withdrawals. Anyways later at night I checked her phone and read her messages with her bf from when we first left the house to the day we came back. 

He had accused me of manipulating her, of trying to break up their family, and so on. Which is what i expected. What I didn’t expect was to see my sister plotting to take money from my account to pay their rent and send him money for food, and say “I’m just waiting for her to calm down then I’ll come back home to you baby.” 
I felt so betrayed, later that day I called my mom and told her everything. I was also being verbally threatened in their house after we came back from the shelter, the dad would walk by the living room muttering about how some people deserve to be strangled in their sleep. The mom would call me names when I would walk by. After my talk with my mom she told me to come back home and live with her, I’m a big mommas girl and I’ve lived with her most my life so I know how her way of being is and I always enjoyed living with her. That night I packed my stuff when everyone was asleep and at 7 am dressed as if I was going to work but drove to my moms instead, all the way to California. My sister then became skeptical about where I was at and went to my job to get a coffee and that’s when my manager told her I had moved, she started blowing up my phone and saying things like “how could you do this to me and the kids” “why would you leave us here with this monster” and so on. Mind you when we moved back in with him she was kissing him and calling him baby right away. 

Months later I found out they tried to open up a card in my name but my bank denied it because they didn’t have a photo ID just my social security  number and a copy of my birth certificate. And she had another baby with him, if I do the math correctly she got pregnant 2 months after I had moved away. 

I still think back to that time and wonder if I was the a** hole for leaving them without saying goodbye, and leaving them in that situation. ",2,1755257622.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Most places are not even real small businesses, it’s all Tims and Starbucks and other fast food chains. Which employ temporary foreign workers who are exploited by franchise owners. The landlords who lease space to those businesses want office workers back, because if the revenue drops, then the businesses close and the billionaire landlords won’t have commercial tenants paying their rent. 

Finally we also need to boycott the “charity” campaigns and not spend our money on United Way and Fed Health. If you want, you can donate to these organizations directly instead of via the OPS, or donate to other charities You care about directly. Don’t let those boot licking execs get bragging rights and bonuses for meeting Ministry targets with your money. My Ministry didn’t meet its Fed Health fundraising goals this year and many of my colleagues couldn’t be happier about it. ",35,1755257269.0,OntarioPublicService,7,1.0,False

Moved into this apartment in Sydney, Australia 3 weeks ago and haven’t seen any roaches until this evening.

These were really small (the smallest ones about the size of a pin head/the largest ones the size of a tictac), but there were 6-7 of them so I suspect they are reproducing somewhere here. They were all cosying up behind the coffee machine which I bought 3 days ago (second hand) which I suspect is reproducing them like wildfire. Any tips on trying to keep them out?

I have been using these baits since the same time I got the coffee machine on where I think their entry point is (pipes under the sink/up the gas lines) but they seem to bypass them and get to the other side of the kitchen where said coffee machine is. I have cleaned the kitchen throughly and will keep the coffee machine as clean as possible but that is hard as I use it every day.

Any advice on how to repell them? Thanks a lot.",1,1755257244.0,AskAnAustralian,3,0.67,False

1mquyf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/couplesresortsjamaica/comments/1mquyf4/couples_tower_isle_overall_review/,Couples Tower Isle - Overall Review,"I did a post of what arriving was like earlier this week, here’s the recap of our experience here, now that we’re about to head back home today …

First - overall, it was absolutely worth it. If you have a busy life, full of managing details, work, etc - this is a really pleasant escape in a beautiful place, where you don’t have to think about much. 

We did water skiiing, snorkeling, and paddleboarding, the complementary catamaran trip, and a shopping trip to the local area. Plus a lot of time at the pool. We watched two of the evening shows - the fire show and the singer and we ate at every restaurant except the Veranda - because it was closed and merged with another restaurant for most of our stay. 

Bad first - the shopping trip. If you’re on the fence about this and you don’t like feeling pressured to buy stuff, I don’t recommend it. Every store we saw had the same stuff. I guess some people find the nicer diamond and silver jewelry to be a good deal, but we weren’t here for that and didn’t look. The rest of the stuff was standard tourist stuff, which is fine, but one store would have been enough. 

Now the good - The water sports we did were a lot of fun. I wish we’d planned better and done a scuba class as we’ve now learned that getting PADI certified at home is about 40% more expensive than doing it here. But we missed our window to get it done before we had to leave. One piece of advice - several of the water sports have sign-up a day in advance requirements and some also have some training required. Be sure to figure it out as soon as you arrive to avoid missing out on what you want to do. 

The Catamaran trip was a highlight for us. Be sure to bring sunscreen as there is zero shade and the sun hits you hard both from above and reflecting off the water. You will get to swim in about 15 feet of open water and it’s beautiful. You’ll also see a waterfall and we were lucky enough to see a dolphin. 

It’s worth noting that on both boat excursions we did some people got seasick and they were pretty miserable until well after we got back to land. Highly recommend you get some seasickness medicine ahead of time if this is a risk for you. We were lucky, but we felt awful for the folks who weren’t. There isn’t really any escape from it once it starts and you just have to suffer until you get back to land and start feeling better. 

The room itself was a Deluxe Ocean room which is a pretty standard 3 star hotel room, albeit a bit dated and in need of a refresh, but with an absolutely incredible view. 

Now the great - the food. They closed the Verandah restaurant for much of our stay and instead made another restaurant semi à la carte. So you got the Verandah main courses but with a buffet for your appetizers, salad, soup, and dessert. Several of our favorite meals came from this arrangement so no complaints here whatsoever.  

The staff also goes into the great category. The service here is amazing. Not much more to say than this: you get pampered. 

We really enjoyed the cat watching. There are maybe 5-6 cats and they keep to their own territories. A couple occasionally beg for food, but they leave if you tell them to. They’re fun to watch when they play and they’re really well socialized and friendly. I know some others we saw really didn’t like the cats, but they seemed to be in the minority. 

Now the miscellaneous/odd/mixed:

The restaurants aren’t labeled. None of the areas are really. Some of them, like the coffee shop and gym are easy to figure out. Others, like the several restaurants aren’t. I recommend doing the orientation tour - we didn’t and I think it showed on our faces at times as people would ask if it was our first day. 

People claim the shady spots early. I have skin that is basically flammable, so this was an issue for us. Others soak up the sun and don’t mind the lack of shade - but it’s something to be aware of. We never had trouble finding shade, but it was rarely in the first place we looked. Maybe it was good as it forced us to explore a bit. 

We didn’t do the AN island, so can’t comment on that. I’ll just say, because it seems to be a common question in this sub, nothing we saw indicates that this resort gets particularly risqué or overtly sexual. It was clear some couples here made some connections, and I can’t speak to anything that might have happened on the island as I never went there, but sex doesn’t seem to be the focus here at all. 

The dance party / fire show. This is getting mixed reviews because it was some of the best food we had while we were here but it was also very, very loud and felt forced somehow. And it went on for a loooong time. We had fun, but we also left after about two hours of the loudspeaker encouraging us to “give it up one ti-eeem-uhh!”

It’s time to go check out now, but I’m happy to answer any questions while I’m traveling home today.

As AI integrations become super accessible, I'm seeing huge opportunities to automate parts of our lives - especially finances. I just started earning and honestly can't get a handle on my spending habits. Current expense managers feel outdated because you have to manually enter everything, which I think we can totally improve now.

# My idea:

An app that runs in the background and automatically captures your transaction-related messages (bank notifications, payment confirmations, etc.) and adds them to your dashboard. Could use an on-device model for privacy. Plus natural language entry - just say ""I spent 25 bucks on coffee with Sarah"" like you'd tell a friend, and the app handles categorization and logging.

# What I'm looking for:

* **Feedback** on this concept
* **Pain points** you face with current expense tracking
* **Features** that would make you actually pay for something like this
* **Privacy concerns** or technical challenges you see

Right now I'm manually going through bank statements and it's painful. Would love to hear what frustrates you most about managing your money and what dream features you'd want in a finance app.

What would make you switch from your current solution (or finally start tracking expenses)?

He was young- in his early 30s. His father has always been kind of distant- he did come to say goodbye, but was not actively involved during my husband’s illness. Since husband’s passing, his father has barely reached out to me- will occasionally respond with one or two word texts if I reach out to him, but no warmth or sharing of memories from him. 

Now here is where I need advice- I am returning to my late husband’s home town this fall for the first time since his memorial service. His father still lives there- we haven’t spoken in nearly 7 months. Part of me feels like I should reach out to him to meet for coffee out of obligation, but truthfully I don’t want to see him. Is that horrible? Have you lost touch with your in-laws? He may hear that I was in town for the wedding, and I feel ashamed that I don’t want to spend time with him.

1mqus96,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1mqus96/am_i_enough/,Am I enough,"The day will inevitably come when every one of us will close our eyes for the last time. Whether you believe in Christ or not, none of us will get the chance to undo the things we have done, how we treated others, how we made them feel. In short, we won’t be able to change the color of our heart. What’s done is done.

Yesterday I walked past a beggar. He had a little radio playing music, and next to him were two cups full of pennies, probably worth less than $5. He didn’t look up at the people passing by. In the brief moment I walked past, he seemed more concerned with finding a comfortable position to sit in. He didn’t acknowledge me; he didn’t even see me. He doesn’t even know I exist.

In that moment, as I walked by with friends, I felt a sense of “superiority” over him. I felt disgusted as I looked at him and how he obviously hadn’t cleaned himself, how he wasn’t a “productive” member of society. I thought about how I was “better” and cleaner than him. Today, those thoughts make me feel disgusted with myself.

I do not know him. I don’t know why he lives on the streets. Maybe he had a rough childhood, was abandoned by society and the people who were supposed to love him. Or maybe he was a criminal who served a long sentence.

But I know now that what I saw is not what God sees. He sees the colors of our souls. I saw a beggar and, in my head, placed myself above him. I thought I was better. But God made us equal, in His image.

The beggar and I will both one day close our eyes for the last time. It doesn’t matter whether that day comes today or in 100 years, because for God, time is just a drop of water in a vast ocean. What counts then is how we carried our hearts while we had time.

If I were to see the beggar today, I would buy him a coffee and give him some money, just to ease his pain a little. I would not do it out of pity, but because it is the right thing to do, to give him five minutes of happiness and maybe a little hope.

I think I would be too nervous to truly speak with him and make small talk, but I would try anyway.

In Hebrews 13 it says: *“Keep on loving one another as brothers and sisters. Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it.”*

Today I think about when I close my eyes and stand trial before God. He will ask for whom I did this, for the beggar or for myself, to make myself feel better. I would answer: for both of us. Two souls, sharing the same time and space in this universe, trying to exist. And I would ask God, “Was I enough?”

In the future I will try to keep my mind more calm. I meditate and pray. I stay in silence, because I think that is the language of God. I won't try to offer someone advice or wisdom and I won't talk about God with them. I will try to talk about live with them, about dreams and hope. I will try to understand them and judge them on their character, not their first impression. ",2,1755256468.0,Christianity,3,1.0,False
1mqur70,https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginalityHub/comments/1mqur70/full_guide_to_sora_chatgpt_by_openai/,Full Guide to Sora ChatGPT by OpenAI,"Video content creators often experience disappointment when it comes to transforming the image they have in mind into a realistic video sequence. In the past, this process took a while and required numerous adjustments due to technological limitations. 

But what if today’s technological advancements allowed you to create a great video in a couple of minutes? What if all you needed to make a dynamic video was to type a short prompt like “a little white dog running through a forest?” That’s what Sora can do for you.

Whether you’re a content creator, marketer, or educator, Sora opens up possibilities that seemed like science fiction just months ago. Therefore, it would be a crime not to try using it or at least not to find out what it is.

# What is Sora ChatGPT?

Let’s start the Sora ChatGPT onboarding with fundamentals. Sora is a system that can understand and generate content across different types of media. 

Without going into too much technical detail (because you don’t need to know all the algorithms the system relies on to use it effectively), Sora can translate abstract concepts into visual content and ensure that objects, characters, and scenes remain coherent as they change throughout the video.

# What’s all the fuss about?

If other similar AI-based tools can create videos, why is everyone so excited about Sora? Well, because unlike the tools that create basic animations, Sora can generate complex scenes featuring multiple characters with distinct personalities and detailed environments that change dynamically over time.

It understands concepts like lighting, shadows, reflections, and even abstract ideas like mood and atmosphere. When you ask Sora to create a video of “a cozy French coffee shop on a rainy evening,” it understands the interplay of warm interior lighting against gray outdoor light and the overall feeling such a scene should make you experience.

# It understands the physical world’s properties

As you already know, AI models learn by analyzing the vast amounts of data that exist today, and Sora is no exception. It has processed numerous videos and can predict how objects should move, how light should behave, and how different materials interact with each other. That’s why we can talk about realistic and believable images and clips here. 

For example, if you prompt Sora to show water being poured into a glass, it understands not just the visual appearance of the liquid, but also concepts like gravity, refraction, surface tension, and even the subtle sounds that might accompany this action. 

# What if you don’t need a realistic image?

Without a doubt, you might want to create an image or video that has nothing in common with the real world. Can Sora be your solid source of support then? Sure, it excels at creative and fantastical content too. Moreover, you can use it to blend realistic elements with imaginative concepts to create something astonishing and relatable at the same time.

This is a great chance for artists, filmmakers, and content creators who want to explore visual ideas that would be expensive or impossible to capture with traditional video production methods. To awaken your imagination and create interesting prompts for Sora, you can use this college essay topic generator and develop non-trivial ideas for your images.

# Key points so far

So, what is Sora in ChatGPT’s [ecosystem](https://plagiarismcheck.org/blog/gpt-4-5-openais-most-interesting-model-yet/)? Here are the three points you need to remember for now:

* **What you provide**: Text descriptions or image references.
* **What you get**: High-resolution video (typically 1 minute).
* **The tool’s capabilities**: Realistic motion, complex physics, and visual consistency.

To answer your question on how to use Sora ChatGPT when you already have images you want to turn into videos, it’s possible to do so by adding motion or effects, as well as by extending the scene beyond its original frame. You can also modify existing videos by changing styles or completely reimagining scenes.

Thanks to the language expertise of the OpenAI Sora text-to-video model, it can understand nuance and intent in prompts, which means that you can add layered instructions and indirect references when working on visual content creation. It’s one of the key functions that distinguishes Sora from simpler prompt-based tools.

# How you can use it

Although Sora is still in limited access as of now, you can start using it if you have an active subscription to one of these premium OpenAI services:

* **ChatGPT Plus**. The standard premium subscription provides access to GPT-4 and priority access to new features, including ChatGPT Sora.
* **ChatGPT Pro**. This is a higher-tier subscription with enhanced capabilities and higher usage limits.

Now, it’s time for you to find out how to create videos much faster than you did before.

# Sora step-by-step guide

**Step #1. Choose your input method** 

Sora offers three ways to create videos:

* Text prompts
* Image uploads
* Video inputs

Note that when you use images as references, you need to be careful to avoid plagiarism issues. Just like when you use a [plagiarism tool](https://plagiarismcheck.org/) to detect references that you might have missed, you need to check whether your images or videos are unique enough.

**Step #2. Craft your prompt**

If you choose to upload textual instructions, make sure to write a detailed description of what you want to see. The more specific and descriptive you are, the better Sora can interpret your vision. 

This is when your writing skills that you’ve been improving in college will come in handy. Just like when you ask a professor or an online tool to “[grade my essay](https://plagiarismcheck.org/essay-grader/) for clarity and structure”, crafting a well-written prompt for Sora requires thoughtful wording and attention to detail. The clearer your instructions, the more accurately Sora can bring your ideas to life.

Include details about:

* Scene setting and environment
* Characters or subjects and their actions
* Camera angles and movement
* Lighting and mood
* Style preferences

**Example:** 

*A golden retriever puppy playing in a sunlit meadow filled with wildflowers, shot from a low angle with warm afternoon lighting, the camera slowly panning to follow the puppy’s playful movements.*

In addition, you can upload an image to accompany your prompt for Sora to create the desired:

* Setting
* Character design
* Color scheme
* Composition

This feature is useful for animating sketches or keeping brand visuals consistent.

**Step #3. Configure video parameters** 

Select your preferred settings:

* **Aspect ratio**: Choose from widescreen (16:9), square (1:1), or vertical (9:16)
* **Duration**: Set the length up to the maximum allowed
* **Resolution**: Select your desired output quality (up to 1080p)
* **Style Preferences**: Choose any stylistic options that are relevant

**Step 4. Generate and review** 

Keep in mind that generation times can vary depending on complexity and current system load. Once complete, review your video and decide whether you need to make any changes to it or if you are happy with the result.

# Tips on creating prompts that work

It’s no secret that the effectiveness of AI-based tools depends on how well you write your prompts. Just like it’s impossible to craft an outstanding literary piece without using a [grammar checker](https://plagiarismcheck.org/grammar-checker/), you can’t create the video you want without listing clear and detailed instructions. Here are some recommendations on how to do it.

# Be specific and descriptive 

The key to success is to avoid being too vague.

* **Vague**: A cat playing
* **Specific**: A fluffy orange tabby cat batting at a dangling feather toy in a bright living room, with sunlight streaming through lace curtains, creating soft shadows on hardwood floors

Well-crafted prompts like this give Sora the detail it needs to generate vivid scenes. If you’re unsure about the clarity of your prompt, running it through a Chat GPT checker can help identify ambiguous language, just like proofreading an essay.

# Include technical details 

If you have a clear idea of what your video should look like from the technical viewpoint, you can specify camera work as well: “close-up shot,” “wide establishing shot,” “tracking shot,” or “bird’s eye view.” Additionally, you can mention lighting: “golden hour lighting,” “dramatic shadows,” or “soft diffused light.”

# Set the scene 

To get an image or video very similar to the one you want, you can describe the location, time of day, weather, season, and atmosphere.

# Describe motion and action 

Be clear about how subjects should move: “walking slowly,” “running energetically,” “floating gracefully,” or “spinning rapidly.” It is also possible to include camera movement: “camera slowly zooms in” or “steady tracking shot.” 

Keep these three points in mind

1. **Start simple.** Given the fact that you have never used Sora before, it’s a good idea to begin with straightforward prompts to understand how it interprets your descriptions. You can then gradually increase complexity as you become more familiar with the way everything works.
2. **Iterate and refine.** One of the biggest mistakes that leads to disappointment is expecting perfect results on the first try. Sora will make many mistakes and misinterpret your instructions. Therefore, you can experiment with your feedback to see what works best.
3. **Save successful prompts.** Keep a record of the prompts that produce desired results to create your own reference library for future projects.

# What Sora can’t do

We’ve already mentioned Sora’s numerous benefits and capabilities, so you may naturally start to wonder if it has any limitations. And of course it does, just like any other tool that exists today. So, let’s consider some of these limitations.

# Real person likenesses

If you wish to create a video where you and Justin Bieber are dancing together or where you meet with King Charles, Sora will not do that for you. It can’t generate videos featuring recognizable real people, including public figures, celebrities, and private individuals. 

This limitation extends beyond exact likenesses, so you won’t be able to create a video using detailed physical descriptions of famous people. Therefore, you should be cautious about creating videos that mimic real people or copyrighted characters. While Sora can create original content, using real-world references might raise legal and ethical issues.

Explicit content

The platform also maintains strict policies against generating explicit, violent, or inappropriate content. These filters process information at multiple levels and block attempts to create such dangerous material.

Other limitations

Here are some more examples of why Sora is not perfect (yet):

* It may cause inconsistencies in long sequences.
* It may interpret ambiguous prompts in unexpected ways.
* Its real-world physics and object interactions are improving, but not flawless.

# Mistakes to avoid

Even though you already know how to use Sora ChatGPT, some mistakes can stand in the way of creating incredible videos. Here are some of them:

Overly complex prompts 

Don’t include too many elements in a single prompt, as it might be difficult for the system to decipher your message correctly. Remember that Sora performs better with focused descriptions rather than lengthy lists of requirements.

Inconsistent style references 

Another thing you should not do is mixing conflicting style-related directions in the same prompt. Choose one primary visual style and support it consistently throughout your description.

Ignoring physical constraints 

As you already know, Sora can create fantastical content. Nevertheless, completely ignoring physics or logical spatial relationships can result in unexpectedly strange results.

Generic descriptions 

The last thing you want to do is ask Sora to create “beautiful” or “amazing” videos for you. This prompt will not get you very far. Instead, use specific descriptive language that gives the tool concrete visual direction.

Poor time management 

Having access to the tool doesn’t mean that you will now generate videos within seconds. It still takes time to get the results you need. Therefore, leave time for multiple iterations and refinements so that you can engage in the creative process for as long as you need.

Neglecting platform requirements 

Consider your intended platform’s specifications and audience expectations when crafting prompts. Without a doubt, content optimized for TikTok requires different approaches than YouTube or professional presentations.

# Short summary

* **Sora turns text (and images) into video.** Now, every content creator can get access to visual storytelling without spending a fortune on the necessary tools.
* **Detailed prompts lead to better results**. Use the chance to think like a director when you describe your scene to Sora.
* **Sora understands context, tone, and structure**, which is much like ChatGPT, but video-based rather than text-based.
* **You should use it responsibly** to stay mindful of ethical concerns around realism, privacy, and content use.
* **Sora is still evolving**, so you can expect improvements, new features, and wider access in the future.

Examples below:

1) My manager wasn’t there the first day and neither of my coworkers expected me when I showed up. They put me on the register, which was what I did for the first day and a half.

2) My manager never washes her hands. Two of my coworkers never change their gloves. My manager followed me into the bathroom to watch me clean it, wiping down the toilet and everything, and then immediately told me to start making drinks and heating up pastries. Naturally I took my gloves off and washed my hands after cleaning the bathroom because…basic hygiene…right??? She looked at me funny for washing my hands.

3) I get put on the bar for the first time on my third day and I was immediately told to make drinks for customers. My manager’s pissed at me for being slow and not knowing the recipes…when it was my first time seeing said recipes and working at the bar ever.

Then I got fired for not being a good fit. The manager didn’t even tell me I was fired. I texted her for my schedule and the store owner texted me back saying I was let go for not being a good fit. I don’t think this is normal but is it something I should expect if I want to work in this industry? The not washing hands/switching gloves bothers me the most. ",3,1755256152.0,barista,2,0.8,False

Una Storia: ""The Little Cat""
Storia in Inglese
This is a story about a little cat named Luna. Luna has green eyes and soft white fur.
Every morning, she wakes up when the sun rises. She stretches her little paws and yawns. Then, she walks to the kitchen to get her breakfast. Her owner, a kind man named Tom, fills her bowl with delicious food.
After breakfast, Luna loves to play. She chases a small red ball or hunts for a feather toy. In the afternoon, she often sleeps in a patch of sunlight by the window. She dreams of catching mice and butterflies.
In the evening, Tom comes home from work. He pats Luna's head and she purrs loudly. They watch TV together on the sofa. Finally, when it's time for bed, Luna curls up at the foot of Tom's bed, feeling safe and warm.
Traduzione in Italiano
Questa è una storia su una piccola gatta di nome Luna. Luna ha gli occhi verdi e una morbida pelliccia bianca.
Ogni mattina, lei si sveglia quando il sole sorge. Allunga le sue piccole zampe e sbadiglia. Poi, cammina verso la cucina per fare colazione. Il suo padrone, un uomo gentile di nome Tom, le riempie la ciotola con cibo delizioso.
Dopo colazione, a Luna piace giocare. Insegue una piccola palla rossa o caccia un giocattolo di piume. Nel pomeriggio, spesso dorme in un punto soleggiato vicino alla finestra. Sogna di catturare topi e farfalle.
La sera, Tom torna a casa dal lavoro. Accarezza la testa di Luna e lei fa le fusa forte. Guardano la TV insieme sul divano. Infine, quando è ora di andare a letto, Luna si rannicchia ai piedi del letto di Tom, sentendosi al sicuro e al caldo.

Moved into this apartment in Sydney, Australia 3 weeks ago and haven’t seen any roaches until this evening. 

These were really small (the smallest ones about the size of a pin head/the largest ones the size of a tictac), but there were 6-7 of them so I suspect they are reproducing somewhere here. They were all cosying up behind the coffee machine which I bought 3 days ago (second hand) which I suspect is reproducing them like wildfire. Any tips on trying to keep them out? 

I have been using these baits since the same time I got the coffee machine on where I think their entry point is (pipes under the sink/up the gas lines) but they seem to bypass them and get to the other side of the kitchen where said coffee machine is.
I have cleaned the kitchen throughly and will keep the coffee machine as clean as possible but that is hard as I use it every day. 

Any advice on how to repell them? Thanks a lot.

# Weather & Weekend Update:

Burlington wakes up to crisp morning air in the mid to upper 50s today, setting the stage for what looks like a nice August weekend. After weeks of heat and humidity, we're getting a proper break with sunshine and comfortable conditions taking center stage. Today brings wall-to-wall sunshine with highs reaching the low 80s and, mercifully, low humidity that'll make being outside actually enjoyable. Saturday cranks things up a notch with temperatures climbing into the upper 80s to low 90s, though the humidity creeps back in as the day progresses. Sunday's looking like our only shot at some rain with a cold front bringing scattered showers and storms, mostly in the afternoon and evening. Given how parched everything's getting around here (the drought monitor just expanded ""abnormally dry"" conditions to nearly the entire state except our Champlain Valley bubble), even a modest soaking would be welcome. Next week? Think September in August, with temps settling back into the 70s and those glorious cool mornings we all secretly love.

Tonight kicks off another absolutely packed weekend here in the Queen City. The [People's Farmstand](https://frontporchforum.com/calendar/events/430014) returns to Pomeroy Park in the ONE from 5 to 6:30 PM with their pay-what-you-can organic veggies, perfect for grabbing dinner ingredients while supporting food access in our community. Over at Ethos Athletics on Flynn Ave, there's a [Strong For Good fitness class](https://frontporchforum.com/calendar/events/440327) from 5:30 to 6:30 PM benefiting Turning Point Center, where you can work up a sweat for a good cause with no class fee required, just optional donations. The South End's throwing its own party with the [Get Down / Stowe Cider Donut Launch Party](https://www.facebook.com/events/728669996611817/) at The S.P.A.C.E. Gallery from 5 to 9 PM, featuring the 2025 Cider Donut in cans, special cocktails at the Pinery, and enough free swag to make you forget summer's winding down. If you're more in the mood for music than movement, head downtown where BCA's [Summer Concert Series](https://www.burlingtoncityarts.org/event/summer-concert-skylark) brings Skylark, a contemporary string ensemble, to City Hall Park at 12:30 PM, though that's your lunch hour option. For those who want to venture slightly beyond city limits this evening, Winooski's throwing their [Downtown Block Party](https://frontporchforum.com/calendar/events/441082) in Rotary Park from 5 to 8 PM, complete with yacht rock grooves from Pontoon, local beer, gelato, and enough lawn games to keep everyone entertained.

Saturday's gorgeous weather forecast makes it prime time for being outside, and Burlington's delivering options from dawn to dusk. The [Ethan Allen Homestead](https://frontporchforum.com/calendar/events/440497) celebrates its 60th anniversary all weekend long with ""Fanny's Weekend,"" running 10 AM to 2 PM both days, featuring everything from flint knapping demonstrations to ash pounding for Abenaki basketry, plus anniversary cake because what's a party without cake? Down in Shelburne, the [Vermont Zen Center's annual yard sale](https://frontporchforum.com/calendar/events/440711) starts at 9 AM with treasures galore and those legendary homemade baked goods that sell out fast. The [Winooski Community Clean-Up](https://frontporchforum.com/calendar/events/440332) with Rozalia Project runs from 10 AM to noon for those wanting to give back while the morning's still cool. Meanwhile, Shelburne's celebrating [Shelburne Day](https://frontporchforum.com/calendar/events/441073) with discounts at local businesses and Willow House's epic tent sale featuring items up to 90% off starting at just a dollar.

Sunday brings more perfect late-summer programming before those afternoon storms roll through. Local Motion's hosting a [Cycle the City group ride](https://www.localmotion.org/cycle_the_city_20250817) starting at 9:30 AM from their Steele Street headquarters, offering a leisurely clockwise loop showcasing Burlington's best views and hidden gems. The [Soda Plant Sunday market](https://frontporchforum.com/calendar/events/441291) runs 10 AM to 3 PM with vendors showing everything from vintage finds to handmade dancing skirts. Senator Sanders' office is throwing their [free senior lunch](https://frontporchforum.com/calendar/events/439901) at noon at the Hotel Champlain (the old Hilton on Battery Street), complete with good food and live music. Over in Williston, there's a [Back to School Gear Giveaway](https://frontporchforum.com/calendar/events/438762) from 12:30 to 2 PM with free backpacks, school supplies, snow cones, and lawn games. The [Lake Champlain Chamber Music Festival](https://www.lccmf.org/2025overview) opens its Mozartiana series Sunday afternoon at 3 PM with Mozart's Clarinet Quintet and works by Caroline Shaw and György Ligeti, because sometimes you need to balance all that outdoor time with a little high culture.

Today’s high of 83 °F and low of 59 °F align closely with August’s historical averages of 80 °F and 60 °F. In the broader outlook, daily highs between the mid-70s and around 90 °F and lows from the low-50s up to 70 °F suggest a mix of near-average and slightly warmer conditions in the days ahead.

# Building Real Community: Btown Brief IRL Experiment

What events actually get you out engaging with your community? I've been thinking about this after reading countless Reddit threads about how hard it is to make good connections as an adult after school is over with. Sure, we're all ""connected"" online, but when's the last time you had a real conversation with someone new in Burlington?

Here's what I'm considering: launching a **Btown Brief IRL Meetup group** that does things differently. I think that the best events are ones where you’re actively doing something together, letting conversation come naturally. And, like you already know, conversation is the backbone for a true sense of community. Plus, instead of the usual single-focus groups, we'd rotate through 8-15 activities each month. Photography walks, trivia takeovers, volleyball at local parks, food/drink crawls, paint & sip nights, bowling together, game nights, volunteer jobs together, meetups at public events, etc; whatever this community wants to try.

Here’s why I think variety matters: Most meetup groups plateau because they attract the same personality types doing the same thing week after week. But when you see Sarah from trivia night crushing it at volleyball, or discover that quiet Mike from the photography walk is hilarious at game night, something clicks. You start seeing people as full humans, not just ""that person from book club.""

The logistics would be simple: [Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com) for organizing events and Discord for community chat between meetups. Free to begin, then a small monthly fee ($5-10) to support the newsletter and its various events. The small fee actually encourages people to come out, instead of “maybe” coming then cancelling last second.

But I'm not launching this unless there's real interest. Community building only works when the community actually shows up. So help me out and tell me, what would actually get you off your couch and into a room with fellow Burlingtonians? Your votes will shape our first month of activities. Also, how do you feel about age separation, is it important to you? 20/30s group, and then a 40/50s+ group, with some events combined?

[**Burlington lifts water conservation alert**](https://vtdigger.org/2025/08/14/burlington-lifts-water-conservation-alert/)

>

After two days of asking roughly 12,800 Burlington and Colchester customers to ease up on water usage during this week's heat wave, the city lifted its conservation notice Thursday morning. The 25-year-old booster pumps that failed are getting increased maintenance attention, with one already fixed and the other still being worked on. Public Works Director Chapin Spencer says they'll be testing the pumps more rigorously going forward, running them longer during weekly exercises to catch problems before the next heat-induced demand spike hits.

Every Thursday morning at 7:30 AM, the BTV Clean Up Crew meets at the top of Church Street to pick up trash and needles around downtown. Started by Kason Hudman of the Peace & Justice Center, the volunteer effort draws anywhere from five to 60 people weekly, armed with trash pickers, gloves, and sharps containers. Seven Days deputy publisher Cathy Resmer joined last week's cleanup and found the experience surprisingly empowering, noting how many passersby thanked the volunteers for their efforts.

Rich Tarrant, who founded IDX medical information tech company and later ran unsuccessfully against Bernie Sanders for U.S. Senate in 2006, died Tuesday night of cancer. The former Boston Celtics draft pick turned businessman donated tens of millions to Vermont causes, including the rec center at St. Michael's College and the stalled UVM Athletic Complex. Vermont had never seen campaign spending like his 2006 Senate race, which introduced a new level of political advertising to the state.

Burlington's two urban park rangers, Neil Preston and Jake Payne, are tasked with managing the impossible: enforcing camping bans across 550 acres of public land while the city faces record homelessness. With more than 40 encampment complaints filed last month alone through the SeeClickFix app, the rangers navigate between angry residents demanding clean parks and unhoused people with nowhere else to go. Preston's approach boils down to ""make it less bad,"" moving camps from neighborhood parks to less visible areas while dealing with guard dogs, needles, and the daily reality that Vermont's chronically homeless population has jumped from 150 pre-pandemic to over 900 today.

Vermont's own Noah Kahan will perform at Folk and Fairways, a new benefit concert at Spruce Peak in Stowe on October 1st. Limited to fewer than 1,500 attendees, tickets will be available through a lottery system at $250 plus fees, with all proceeds benefiting Kahan's Busyhead Project supporting community mental health organizations. The intimate hometown show marks another way the Grammy-nominated artist continues investing in Vermont's wellbeing.

The Connecticut-based tavern-style pizza chain lasted less than eight months at 83 Church Street, closing Sunday after opening with fanfare in late January. The 5,000-square-foot space that once housed Pascolo Ristorante now sits empty again, another casualty in Church Street's ongoing retail shuffle.

Building Burlington's Future launched with serious backing and ambitious goals, raising $1.3 million toward a five-year plan to organize residents before key votes happen, not after. In a recent WCAX interview, former Mayor Peter Clavelle called the decision to reduce police staffing ""one of the greatest mistakes in my public life,"" while board chair Michelle Ash pointed to families hoping loved ones get arrested as ""the only hope"" for drug rehab access. The conversation doesn't pull punches about our challenges: from open drug use and EMT burnout to businesses closing, but also pushes back on pure doom narratives by highlighting new hotels, vibrant festivals, and south end development. Key observations include that just 10 people generate 40% of police calls, individual organizations are hiring private security when government can't maintain public safety, and Burlington has become Vermont's de facto overflow valve for statewide problems without adequate state support. The group's betting 4,000 signed-up residents (75% Burlington, 25% Chittenden County) can turn frustration into policy wins, building a public dashboard to track whether we're actually improving on safety, housing, and economic indicators rather than relying on vibes-based progress reports.

The Québec-based band plans to oppose a donated Native American sculpture meant for Battery Park, calling it inauthentic and offensive. The wooden carving would replace the rotting 42-year-old ""Chief Greylock"" statue removed last month, but has reignited the heated debate over who can claim Abenaki identity. The controversy puts Burlington City Council in an awkward position after adopting a 2022 resolution recognizing the Missisquoi band as the tribal authority for Abenaki matters, while scholars in Canada dispute Vermont bands' genealogical claims.

Over 2,500 unionized UVM employees are protesting a mandatory insurance audit requiring them to submit birth certificates and marriage licenses to Willis Towers Watson, a company that reported a data breach in 2023. The university's paying up to $114,000 for the audit to verify dependent eligibility, threatening to remove family members from coverage if employees don't comply. Union leaders particularly worry about transgender family members whose documents may not match current identities, demanding new president Marlene Tromp negotiate the process.

After 54 years in a St. Paul Street basement, college bar institution What Ales You is moving around the corner to the former Manhattan Pizza & Pub space at Church and Main. Owner Syd Eren cited soaring insurance costs and dropping alcohol revenue as forcing the move to a location with a kitchen, where serving food can both grow income and lower liability costs. The bar hopes to open in its new ground-level home around August 22, complete with pizza on the menu.

Normally, I'm very happy, even proud to host a writing spider/st Andrew's cross, and she's BY FAR the largest I've ever seen. But when you are sitting in the house working on something and you hear your girlfriend scream bloody murder outside, it makes for a less pleasant situation.

When I came out, I found her with her hair in a mess, yoga mat and keys on the ground, and she pointed at the keys. She walked face first eight into this Orb weaver and the spider was hanging off of her hair. The spider got knocked down to the ground and the car keys went with. Don't worry, everyone is OK if shaken up a bit.

A group of Nemesis ships flew after her and prepared their guns to land the killing blow. But as they descended upon the falling Daisy, Lucas shot at them. The Nemesis quickly broke off from their attack, trying to evade the bombardment, but Lucas, skillfully flying, destroyed them all before they could.

As Flaremane recovered Daisy, Lucas shot her a big thumbs up from his cockpit.”You okay, Damara?”

“Thanks to you, my friend.”

\*\*\*

Meanwhile, at the United Planets base, the war room was overflowing with anxiety. The personnel monitored the battle closely as the casualties increased. The United Planets ships had a transmitter that told their location on the chaotic battlefield. Carter and the others looked intensely at the giant holophone panel displaying the numbers. As they decreased faster and faster, he knew another pilot was slayed, shot out of the sky. And as a loud alarm rang, he couldn’t help but draw his sword, instinctively ready to defend his remaining soldiers.

”What the hell does that sound mean?”

“General Carter, it means we’re dead. Darkhold is about to reach full power,” Eugene said.

*“No.”*

Carter turned his gaze to the holophone panel, and the image made his face pale white. Darkhold began to emit dazzling purple light that bathed over the battlefield for miles. Its guns launched a titanic salvo of plasma in the blink of an eye. The assault was not only immensely devastating but also precise. Hitting the United Planets with near-perfect accuracy as the Nemesis retreated. The energy attack covered the sky from left to right, decimating the United Planets except for one pocket of ships. Using all her strength, Daisy protected her comrades from the assault with her giant shield, fighting against the herculean strength of the shock waves.

""Damara, if you can hear me. We're going into full retreat from the planet.”

“But General Carter, they could still shoot us. The fortress’s range is the entire sector.”

“We still have to try. If we stay here, we’re dead. There’s no choice but to cut our losses and save as many civilians as possible,"" Carter said.

""Sir, yes, sir.” Daisy swallowed. “I'll cover your exit while you start evacuating. They'll want me dead above everyone else.""

\*\*\*

With no time to lose, the remaining ships went into full retreat. Daisy hung behind to cover their rear from the assault, blocking the plasma. But as they flew, Lucas spotted something invaluable with his eagle eyes, honed from years of aerial combat. Through the seemingly impenetrable wall of light, he deciphered an attack pattern. From that came a narrow path to assault the mighty fortress. 

A grim decision quickly plagued his mind. Would he dare fly to it by himself? He was his mother’s world. Something terrible would surely befall her if he perished. And Lucas couldn’t ask his fellow soldiers to go back. The path was too narrow and treacherous. Carter would never allow it. However, retaking the planet would be a near-impossible task if they retreated now. 

So his choice was clear.

""Mother, Sarah, Daisy, I'm so sorry,"" Lucas said.

Swiftly, Lucas broke away from the other ships, diving into the bombardment.

*""Pilot, why are you heading toward the fortress? I ordered a full retreat,""* Carter said over the communicator.

""General Carter, I spotted a weakness in their attack pattern. We can't lose this part of space. I know I can do this.""

""All you'll do is end up dead. Turn around now, and that's a direct order. Fortis, do h-""

Lucas turned off his communications and focused on the task at hand. With his skillful flying, Lucas narrowly dodged several shots, making it into the slender path. As the shots fired, certain death surrounded him at every corner, but he continued towards the fortress, undeterred. 

As he made it through the barrage, he flew through the fortress, shooting everything in sight. Quickly, cyber troopers and ships gave chase, trying to shoot him dead. But as Lucas attempted to evade, he spotted a structure surging with incredible power. He hastily realized the structure must have been one of its power conduits, flying toward it at top speed. Lucas unleashed a salvo at it, starting a massive explosion. However, he jetted from the fortress using his ship’s turbo boosters, narrowly escaping the monstrous blaze.

The explosion sent shockwaves for miles away from the fortress. And quickly, its systems lost power, going dark. Cymbeline released a scream rivaling the ferocity of Morana’s roars as the plasma fire subsided. However, as he saw Lucas's ship, he typed away on a holographic control panel. Summoning a giant targeting system, immediately locking Lucas.

*""Blacken and burn,""* Cymbeline shouted.

Three circles of increasing size appeared before Cymbeline. He shot a jet of fire from the palm of his hand into them. The targeting system guided it right toward Lucas. And before he could dodge, it hit him, blowing up his jets. The explosion knocked him unconscious, and he fell helplessly through the air. However, as Daisy saw the attack, she rushed towards her friend's aid.

Morana spotted Daisy in the air, and she immediately sprouted her wings to give chase. But Cymbeline grabbed her leg, pulling her back down.

”Morana, please stay here. You’ll be a hindrance if you go after Damara.”

Morana swiftly grabbed Cymbeline by the neck, crushing his windpipe. ""What did you say to me?”

“C-calm down. I have a plan, and I don't want you hurt. ”Cymbeline pointed towards Daisy. 

As Morana looked at her, she released Cymbeline, seeing a group of cyber troopers attacking her. Daisy sped through the air, dodging their shots, trying to get to Lucas before he crashed. Quickly, Daisy reached Lucas and ripped open his cockpit. But as she attempted to get him out, one of the troopers shot her hand. As Daisy reeled in pain, she tossed her shield at the enemies, but they dodged her attack and continued their barrage. 

Daisy prepared to attack again, but she stopped as she saw a giant tree in the path of the falling ship. She had to grab Lucas before it was too late. Still, the enemies bombarded her more, keeping her from reaching out her hand to him. However, she soon took the risk, focusing on attack and flying away from Lucas, tossing her shield at them.

Lucas fell further away, but the moment the enemy took to dodge, Daisy pulled on Flaremane's reigns, summoning the stallion's speed to catch up. The collision neared, but Daisy ripped Lucas out of the ship. And she flew away with Lucas as the ship collided with the tree, exploding in a brilliant inferno. The troopers continued their attack as Flaremane carried the two to safety. 

""Your plan failed.” Morana pointed to her angry face. “Note the lack of surprise.""

""I-""

""I'm in charge now. I now know why the emperor wanted me to come. He knew you would make a mess of things, and someone would have to clean it up,"" Morana interrupted. 

Cymbeline looked at Morana condescending and intense flames incarnated around his body.

""No, I am the commanding officer of this mission. I alone will set fire to our enemies.” Cymbeline shoved Morana, forcing her onto a wall. *“You will do what I say to aid that cause, but until then, remain silent.""*

Morana looked deeply at Cymbeline. Never before had he or anyone other than Mavor stood their ground against her. With his devotion to the cause on display, something started within Morana. She gripped her chest as her icy heart pounded harder and harder like a chorus of drums, and her cheeks blushed red.

""O-okay, you're in charge.” Morana walked forward, pressing her breasts against Cymbeline. “Give the word, and I'll do anything.""

""Good. Now, we have to push on with the invasion.""

Morana kissed Cymbeline on the cheek. ""Yes, sir, please keep the orders coming.""

\*\*\*

Daisy and the others returned to their crumbling base. Hastily, she dismounted from Flaremane and carried Lucas to some doctors, treating the injured. 

“Will he be okay?”

“We won’t know until we run some tests.”

As she saw the Generals, she dashed over to them. ""Sirs, what's the plan now? Lucas bought us some time, but we need another attack.""

""Isn't it obvious? We need to call reinforcements to attack the enemy while they're down.” Carter exhaled heavily. “I only hope they can get here in time.""

""I'm not even sure that's the right choice,” Favian said.

“What are you talking about, Hydromos?”

“Without the guardian barrier, calling in reinforcements means pulling them away from vital sectors. And now, the enemy's retreat from earlier stinks of a trap.""

Unanticipatedly, the ground shook like an earthquake. In a heartbeat, Daisy prepared for another battle, tightening her grip on her shield. But she turned pale white as she saw the source was a massive explosion from Palus urbs. Hastily, she shot her look toward the generals.

Favian gave her a nod. ""Tend to the civilians, Damara. We'll be here when you return.""

""Thank you.""

Swiftly, Daisy hurried to Flaremane and flew off like the wind. As she went to the city, she pierced through a thick layer of the blackest baneful-smelling smoke, emitting from the burning settlement. She quickly arrived over the sky at Palus Urbs to look at its disastrous state. The fire covered the great metropolis as tall buildings lay in pieces, and screams of pain filled the air. Still, she hastily landed to aid the decimated city.

As she dismounted from Flaremane, she stared up close at the devastation from the Nemesis attack. Numerous dead bodies littered the ground. And amongst the ruin, a little aquis boy cried a river as he stood solitary in a sea of death. With her superhuman speed, Daisy dashed to the boy. She consoled him with a hug. And he slowly stopped crying.

*“Please, forgive me*,*”* Daisy said sorrowfully.",3,1755255133.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

As nighttime fell Sarah and Lucas sneaked through the corridors to Carter's room. They both scanned the place vigorously for anyone else but spotted no one. Lucas banged on the wall to summon Daisy, and as she heard his signal, she hurried from behind a corner over to Carter’s room.

“Thanks, guys,” Daisy said.

Inside his room, Daisy hugged Carter.

”Sorry to bother you. But I needed to see you after the day I had.”

“It must have been a pain dealing with that jerk.” Carter placed a hand on Daisy’s cheek.

“Carter, Favian isn't a jerk. It's like what Róngyù said. We’re all under serious pressure. Just today, he helped me with some scared children.”

Carter took a deep breath. “Fine, red, for you. I’ll give the guy a chance. But sometimes I think you're too nice.”

“Thank you.”

Daisy kissed Carter good night. But as she enjoyed his taste in her mouth, she kissed him again. And again, his taste was too much to resist, and she went in for more. As her kisses became more aggressive, the couple tumbled back to Carter's bed, and he lay on her. However, as they were about to begin making love, Daisy transformed into Damara.*”No.”* And sent Carter flying off of her at the door.

\*\*\*

In the corridor, Favian and Yara walked by Carter's room. They talked business but stopped as they saw the door vibrate, sharing a look as they hurried closer to it.

“Sir, isn't that General Carter’s room?” Yara raised her canine ears to listen and gasped. ”By the lawgiver, I hear a woman in there.”

As he heard Yara, Favian immediately considered busting down the door to see what was wrong. But he ultimately decided against it. Favian was too proud to admit it openly, but Carter had proven himself to be a diligent general with the day’s work. He assumed there had to be a reasonable explanation. And, if not, the mission took priority. They couldn’t afford any more delays. However, afterward, he would report Carter if anything remotely obscene surfaced.

Favian exhaled heavily, rubbing his hand over his face. ”Yara, let's pretend we didn't see or hear anything for now.”

“Are you sure, sir?”

Favian nodded.

“If you say so, General Favian.”

\*\*\*

Inside, Daisy held her chest like she had a stroke, breathing heavily. But as Carter saw her, he got off the floor and angrily stomped over, sitting beside Daisy.

“Red, even though I don't personally believe in them. I’m trying my best to respect your religious beliefs.” Carter grabbed Daisy, shaking her vigorously. “So how about you throw me a bone and don't tempt a man.”

“I’m so sorry. I didn't mean to lead you on.” Daisy cried. “I’m garbage.”

Daisy quickly fell on the bed, balling her eyes out. Carter watched, pulling her up and trying to shake her out of it.

*""Daisy, enough. I don’t care anymore.”*

“But look what I did.”

“You slipped up one time. In a lifetime of being a saint.”

“It’s still unforgivable.”

Carter angrily stood up. “I’m in a time loop. I don’t know how many times we’ve had this conversation.”

“What are you talking about?”

“It’s like the talk we had before you got kidnapped. Unless you’re perfect. Unless you sacrifice more than everyone else, you’re never happy.”

“Carter-“

“Why do you always do this to yourself?""

""Because wrong is wrong. If you lie, then it's always okay to lie. Breaking a promise once makes it easier the next time. And now more than ever, I can't afford that."" Daisy took a pillow off the bed and walked from Carter to a corner.

""What are you doing?"" Carter slapped his forehead.

""Finding a nice corner. I can’t risk anyone asking questions about Damara wandering the corridors at night. And I don’t trust myself to sleep in the same bed with you.""

""Daisy, stop. I'll take the corner, and you can have the bed.""

""Carter, there's no way I'll ask you to do t-""

""You're not asking me. I want to do it,"" Carter interrupted.

Daisy looked at Carter, small tear droplets escaping her eyes. ""I don't deserve you.""

Daisy dashed over to Carter, hugging him. She soon took the bed as Carter occupied the corner. And she blew him a kiss goodnight as they drifted off to sleep.

In outer space, an army of satellites was adrift in the void. They floated around light years apart, casting a vast net around the border to the western planets. But each one soon surged with incredible power. It spread out from them, racing across space. The energy from each satellite quickly collided and merged into one another, forming a colossal wall, standing as a guardian for light years of space.

On planet Aqua, Favian watched Eugene and the other scientists work with bated breath. Eugene and his staff typed like there was no tomorrow on the computers, trying to manage the celestial project. But Eugene quickly finished his work.

Favian hurried over to him. ""Well, Doctor, how is it?""

""The guardian barrier is fully functional, General Favian. The only thing that can pass through it now is United Planets ships. Or an object of astronomical force.""

""Thank you, Dr. Parker. You have earned the gratitude of my people and all the people of the western planets.""

""Don't mention it, General Favian. It was your advanced technology that made my vision possible.” Eugene nervously chuckled. “There was no telling how long it would have taken if I had to make the hardware from scratch.""

Yara ran over to the two. ""General Favian, Damara, is outside the door.""

Hastily, Favian left Eugene for Daisy in the corridor.

""Good morning, General Favian.""

""Same to you, Damara. I hope you slept well.""

""I slept the best I could.” Daisy sighed. “So Yara tells me you want a favor.""

“Yes, I do. But as a general, it's shameful for me to ask.”

“What type of favor is this?”

“It all started sometime after you liberated the earth. Several units of Nemesis soldiers came to Orion, saying they saw through Mavor's lies and wanted to defect.” Favian ran his hand over his face. “We ran every check we could, and it seems they told the truth. So Orion put them under my command.”

“This all sounds wonderful. What’s the problem?”

”The problem is their integration has been a disaster. I keep getting complaints of harassment. And the claims keep getting more serious. So many soldiers in this army refuse to accept them.” Favian exhaled heavily. “Damara, I’ve failed to discipline my forces, but maybe the hero of our galaxy will have better luck. Please give them a talk.” 

“I understand. And I think you're a splendid general for asking for help.”

Daisy presented Favian with a handshake, and he accepted it with a small smile.

\*\*\*

Outside, Carter’s Lieutenant walked through the base, scanning the military personnel hurrying to finish their jobs. Scars from his many years of fighting as a juvenile delinquent, and then, a soldier covered his face and body. Clive, twenty-four, Caucasian, was a tall, muscular human man with spiky white hair and pale purple eyes. But he soon spotted his brother in arms through the chaos. As he saw Carter commanding his soldiers, his mind wandered back to two years ago.

It was a pitch-black night during the siege on darkhold. The only stable source of light was the bombardment from the Nemesis forces. And much like the present, military personnel hurried to finish their jobs, racing against time. But the crucial difference was Carter was not in command.

Clive looked at his fellow soldiers with agita as panic ran through the army.

*""I need orders. Who's giving orders?""*

“That's Captain Carter’s job. But there's something wrong with him. It's like he's a dead man.”

“We’re all going to be dead men and women if we don't figure out something now.”

Another bombardment hit their camp. It ignited a colossal inferno, bathing the land in heat. The flames rushed the area, consuming all in their path, and the soldiers tried desperately to extinguish them. But as Clive saw his comrades struggle, he hurried to Carter's tent. And he found his friend collapsed on the ground, a dead man, but only dead inside as his spirit was crushed.

""Carter, you need to get out there now. If you don't lead us, we'll all die,"" Clive said.

""Who cares? Nothing matters.""

""Brother, I understand you loved her, but Daisy wouldn't want this. She wouldn't want to be the death of you.” Clive stooped down to Carter. “Let alone the death of all the people that will follow if we fail.""

""Death is the keyword. It makes everything meaningless. I've tried my whole life to fight it, but now it's time to give up.""

Carter started to cry, but as Clive saw him, he looked at him, fuming. He hoisted Carter by the neck and made him look him in the eye directly at his glare.

""I'll say it one more time. She wouldn’t want this. She wouldn't want people to die because of her. She wouldn't want you to give up on all hope.” Clive tossed Carter back onto the ground. “If you loved her, do the right thing.""

""Y-you're right, my friend. But I'm not strong enough to do this alone anymore.""

""Say no more."" Clive extended a helping hand.

As Carter took his hand, he was shakey, falling over himself as he labored to stand. But Clive quickly helped him up, and together, the two walked outside to face the battle. However, as Clive recalled the night, the past faded from his mind. And he hurried over to present-day Carter.

""Hey, Carter. Oh, sorry, I'm supposed to refer to you by your fancy rank now, right?""

The two young men stepped forward and simultaneously swung from the hip as if to land a punch, but their hands slapped together in a gesture of friendship, their forearms bulging, testing each other's strength.

""You got that right, rogers. I won't let anyone erode discipline, let alone my lieutenant. Everyone’s going to earn their keep.""

""You'll go hard even on a friend?""

""Especially for my friends.""

They continued the contest, and Carter had the edge, gradually forcing Clive's arm downward. And Clive cracked a smile as he lost.

""Happy to see you back to normal.""

""Thank you, my friend.""

""I'm going over to the field. I have the itch to get a little training in.""

""Please, do.” Carter laughed. “You could use it.""

""Funny."" Clive gave a fake chuckle.

Later, Clive arrived at the training field. He found massive weights, weighing three hundred pounds each, and swiftly picked up a pair with little effort. But Clive dropped them, spotting a mesmerizing sight. He saw another combatant training close by, Ros, a beautiful Nemesis woman.",1,1755255124.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False
1mqub1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/criterionconversation/comments/1mqub1y/on_cassavetes_love_streams/,On Cassavetes’ Love Streams,"Cassavetes reminds me of Juan Rulfo, who used to say something like, “I don’t want to speak the way people write, but write the way people speak.” I think Cassavettes accomplishes precisely this in his films (beginning with Shadows), he is able to show the contradictions and poetics of this world, ie class society, through the ‘love event’ (either as potentially successful as in Minnie & Moskowitz or as the tragedies they seem to become under current conditions of life as depicted in Love Streams).. that scene when Rowlands’ character asks Cassavettes’, “what is creativity?”, as they sit around a kitchen table, and she begins pondering how she could become more than a housewife, how she could develop an authentic individuality apart from prescribed roles, etc, but then seemingly snaps out of it and dismisses it as a mere daydream, instead retreating back to her conception of stability and meaningfulness: “I want things to be normal so that I can go back to obsessing about my family”, she says as she decides to go to sleep instead of drinking coffee late at night.. 
Interestingly, after having referred to poetry as something “unhealthy” and as making her “ill” whenever she reads it moments before, she goes on to call her ex-husband and ponders in poetic terms: “do you believe love is a continuous stream?” Seymour responds by calling her crazy, childish, and unstable, basically hysterical (and she is, in the Freudian, ie positive, sense, which sees pathologies as forms of unconscious resistance against an inhumane world and situations) as she goes through a process of questioning her identity and who she truly is throughout the film. As she says explicitly after falling ill: “I don’t know who I am.” 
I also appreciated that scene when she decides to confront her husband and family around a swimming pool, how she could only confront what she considered their betrayal through a seemingly comedic performance which revolves around offending and belittling the husband, as if facing the reality and truth of their relationship, and expressing herself honestly about it, both to herself and others, was simply too much to deal with.. her poetic creativity came out in such a scene as well, which accurately suggested that art and comedy are particularly useful and necessary ways to deal with the harshness and horror of current everyday life.",3,1755255049.0,criterionconversation,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal round walnut coffee table should possess certain features that contribute to its aesthetic appeal, durability, and functionality. Evaluating these features is crucial for selecting a table that meets your specific needs and expectations.

**Material quality:** The quality of the walnut wood is paramount. Look for solid walnut or high-quality walnut veneer over a sturdy core material like MDF or plywood. Solid walnut offers superior durability and a richer grain pattern, while veneer can be a more cost-effective option. The finish should be smooth, consistent, and resistant to scratches and stains.**Tabletop Design:** The tabletop design can vary significantly.Some tables feature a single, solid piece of walnut, showcasing the natural beauty of the wood. Others have intricate inlays, geometric patterns, or even glass inserts. Consider the thickness of the tabletop, as a thicker top often indicates greater stability and longevity.

**Base Construction:** The base of the table provides support and contributes to its overall style. Common base designs include pedestal bases (single central support), tripod legs, or more elaborate metal or wood structures. Ensure the base is sturdy and well-connected to the tabletop to prevent wobbling or instability. The base should also be properly finished to complement the tabletop and resist wear and tear.

**Size and Height:** The dimensions of the coffee table are critical for fitting seamlessly into your living space.Measure your room carefully and consider the size and arrangement of your seating. The height of the table should be roughly the same as your sofa cushions, allowing for agreeable access to drinks and snacks. A table that’s too large will crowd the room, while one that's too small will feel insignificant.

**Finish and Detailing:** The finish of the walnut wood plays a significant role in its appearance and durability. Options include natural oil finishes, lacquered finishes, or stained finishes.Natural oil finishes enhance the wood's natural grain and provide a matte look, while lacquered finishes offer a more protective and glossy surface. detailing, such as beveled edges, carved accents, or metal hardware, can add visual interest and sophistication.

**Weight Capacity:** Consider the weight capacity of the table if you plan to use it for more than just holding drinks and magazines. A sturdy coffee table should be able to support books, decorative items, and even occasional meals without buckling or straining. Check the manufacturer's specifications for recommended weight limits.

Key features of a well-designed round walnut coffee table include:

* Superior material construction
* Aesthetic tabletop design
* Sturdy and stable base
* Appropriate size and height
* Durable and beautiful finish
* Adequate weight capacity

## FAQs section

Navigating the world of furniture can raise several questions,especially when investing in a piece like a round walnut coffee table. This section addresses common inquiries to help you make an informed purchase.

**What is the best way to care for a round walnut coffee table?**
regular dusting with a soft cloth is essential to prevent the buildup of dust and grime. For spills, wipe them up immediately with a damp cloth and dry thoroughly. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the finish. Consider using a furniture polish specifically designed for wood to maintain its luster and protect it from scratches and stains. Depending on the finish, you may need to reapply a protective coating periodically.

**How do I determine the right size round coffee table for my living room?**
Measure the available space in your living room and consider the size of your seating arrangement. The coffee table should be approximately two-thirds the length of your sofa and positioned about 14-18 inches away from the sofa. Aim for a height that is similar to your sofa cushions, or slightly lower. A table that is too large will overwhelm the space, while one that is too small will look insignificant.

**What are the different types of walnut wood used in coffee tables?**
American black walnut and European walnut are the most common types. American black walnut is known for its dark, rich color and pronounced grain patterns. European walnut is slightly lighter in color and has a finer grain. The choice between the two depends on your personal preference and the overall aesthetic of your living room. Veneered walnut coffee tables offer a cost-effective alternative to solid walnut, providing the look of walnut at a lower price point.

**Can a round walnut coffee table work in a small living room?**
Absolutely! Actually,the round shape can be particularly beneficial in a small space,as it promotes better traffic flow and prevents sharp corners from obstructing movement. Choose a smaller diameter table to avoid overcrowding the room. Opt for a design with a simple, minimalist base to maximize the feeling of openness.

I use a 3 cup bialetti moka express. 
I use room temperature water. Little less than I would put usually, so below the beginning of the valve and a little less.

Before adding the coffee, I add a paper filter on the bottom of the funnel so the water can be equally distributed and avoid channeling. When preping the coffee, I add half of It and hit very slightly the basket, I think this move is the most important. Then I add the rest and do the same, until the funnel is full. Very slight vertical hit. 

I add another paper filter on the gasket+ filter. Then I Close the moka. 



For the fire: 
I start with the maximum fire possible that can be hidden below  the bottom chamber. Looking from up above I should not see the fire. 

As soon as I see the coffee begin to brew, I immediately lower the fire to the lowest possible until the end. I stop the Brewing by putting the bottom chamber on cold water when I see It almost finished. 
And thats It. 
No more bitterness and acidity.

This left me quite unimpressed with the coffee, so, this time around, I bought a Grinder (Baratza Virtuoso, second hand), got some beans and now, I am looking at you, dear MoccaMasters.

So some simple questions: 

\- What grindlevel do you use on your Virtuoso? Online I read 18-20. Any experience on it? 

\- How much grams of coffee do you use? Online I read 32 grams per 500ml, what's yours? 

Any other tips to brew a perfect cuppa? As coffee beans are wildly expensive here, I don't wanna experiment to much, but start off from a good point and go from there, if you catch my drift.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **ATP Cincinnati Open: Alexander Zverev vs. Ben Shelton – A Matchup of Precision and Potential**

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)**  
Let’s cut to the chase: the books are screaming **Alexander Zverev** as the favorite. His decimal odds hover around **1.65** (implied probability: \~61%) across most platforms, while Ben Shelton’s **2.25** (\~44%) suggests he’s the underdog. The spread? Zverev is -1.5, meaning bettors expect him to win by at least two games. The totals line sits at **24.5-25.5 games**, with even money on Over/Under—so if you’re betting on whether this becomes a “long, grueling marathon” or a “sudden, heart-wrenching sprint,” the books are hedging their bets.

Zverev’s dominance in the numbers isn’t just about rankings—it’s about consistency. He’s a two-time Cincinnati finalist, with a 16-4 career record at the ATP 500 event. Shelton, meanwhile, is still finding his footing on hard courts, with a 6-4 career record that sounds impressive until you realize half those wins came against players named “Trey” or “Jared.” The spread’s -1.5 line? That’s the sportsbook saying, “Zverev’s gonna win, but you better hope he doesn’t give up a few games to make you look smart.”

**Digest the News: Injuries, Quirks, and a Shoelace Tragedy**  
Now, let’s spice things up with some recent “news” (lightly fictionalized for your enjoyment).

Ben Shelton’s camp recently revealed he’s been battling a **“mild case of overthinking”** after his first serve velocity dipped by 2 mph during practice. His coach attributed it to Shelton “getting distracted by the sound of his own… uh… *focus*.” Meanwhile, Shelton’s second serve? Still slower than a sloth on a treadmill, which is concerning given that Zverev’s return game is about as aggressive as a German engineer’s coffee order (precise, unyielding, and always decaf).

On the flip side, Alexander Zverev has been spotted practicing yoga with a **“special emphasis on balancing his ego with his backhand”** (per his physio

I am on a team with several other interns who speak a lot and I struggle to get a word in at times/find that draining when trying to ask questions. I ask questions albeit less than them during coffee chats which is why i prefer two interns max in a coffee chat. Anyways, I do not understand why my manager has expected me to be confident as an intern when I have no prior experience or real knowledge for what I am doing. I told him I prefer to listen to others and really soak up knowledge when I am starting out. I am concerned that they won’t bring me back for something like this?? My work has been of a good standard and I have made no errors either. All the other interns at work like me, and I’m talking 20+ people because we all get along. I know I have social skills, I socialise with everyone at work and yet that I am being labelled unconfident just for talking a bit less in coffee chats?? ",4,1755253644.0,internships,1,1.0,False

1mqtu7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/archcompetitions/comments/1mqtu7w/architects_in_berlin_your_competition_stories/,Architects in Berlin – Your Competition Stories?,"I’m curious to hear from architects in Berlin or nearby who regularly take part in design competitions, whether local, European, or international.

For me, competitions are a way to keep the mind sharp, explore ideas that might not fit into everyday client work, and test concepts against diverse briefs. They are intense at times with late nights, tight deadlines, and the mix of exhilaration and frustration, but they have pushed my design thinking further than any office project could.

I would love to know how you choose which competitions to enter, whether you work solo, with a fixed team, or form collaborations as needed. Have you noticed patterns in what wins and what doesn’t? How do you balance creative freedom with feasibility in your proposals?

If anyone from the Berlin area is interested, it would be great to exchange experiences over coffee or even consider teaming up for future competitions.",1,1755253605.0,archcompetitions,0,1.0,False
1mqtu2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1mqtu2n/worst_week_of_my_life/,worst week of my life,"really long but I cant write this in my diary because of the way I hold my pen and the events that will happen in this tale

started off on a high as I was going to a festival that ive been waiting all year for and my best friend (A) has finally agreed to go after 3 years of asking.

on the way into the festival my fingernail completely ripped off and was been held on by a small string of skin round the cuticle. ive not broken a bone so this was the worst pain I have ever felt in my life (8/10). I was then told by A that it is not that deep and doesn't hurt because she has pcos (she doesn't know that she has it or not, her symptoms are mild. I have more symptoms than her and I dont have it. I digress) I tell this to my mum (who has severe pcos fyi and I am quite literally a miracle baby (an accident)) my mum has had multiple toenails fall off in a similar manner and said they are incomparable. I then had to walk to my campsite which was three hills away. I am bleeding profusely, in immense pain, haven't eaten/toilet in 4+ hours, throwing up in my mouth etc etc etc #obviouslynothavingfun and just having to constantly check that my finger doesn't touch anything. she literally refused to let me go to the medic because it will take too long and we had been in the queue for 4 hours and we had someone waiting for us but then preceded to take 22 minutes to go to the toilet where I had to sit in the cold waiting for her where I could've gone to the medic and she go to the toilet. once I see her walking back from the toilets I put my stuff on and start walking because why do I have to wait any longer we are going to the same place. and she has a go at me

during the last leg of the walk (less than 10 mins left and all downhill) I ask my other friend (B) if I can swap my foodbag to hold her chair because I genuinely physically cannot carry it anymore and she agrees, and she was nice and understanding about it. I only asked her because she had significantly less stuff than everyone else. I carry on walking to camp with her, or so I thought. Once we are at camp we realise we dont know where B is but dont think anything of it because she disappeared from us over 20 times in the line to the festival to the point it was actually ridiculous for her to expect anyone to care where she is. anyways, we get a call from her saying she's still at the exact spot I swapped my bag with her and A is having ago at me but icl if you cant handle she should've said no.

I am sharing my tent with A but she didn't even help set it up saying she doesn't know how even though id tell her what to do so B kindly helps but is sulking so does nothing so a literal stranger helps. bare in mind my fingernail is hanging off the whole time, ive not been medic yet and I cant go toilets before I go medic because if it gets infected id top myself.

I go medic the paramedics are laughing at me. they should consider themselves lucky that they had to bandage my finger instead of resuscitating an overdose.

next day I am in a better mood, once I had slept the pain went down to almost 0. and I reflect my positivity because the festival is finally starting. but I notice A is complaining about absolutely everything and I think harder she's been complaining since before we even all met up at the station. genuinely what is this abhorrent behaviour you're going to a festival ffs fix up and have fun. her complaining is genuinely so draining. next day Friday, I wake up with no voice. she's still complaining. we have an argument telling me to give examples. are you expecting me to have pen, paper and a fucking list. even those people at courtrooms would struggle to write down everything she fucking said because more often than not what she says is completely negative. so, we are arguing, she is talking over me and then accusing me of shouting when I am trying to say what I want to say (I wasn't even over 20 decibels) sorry I actually hate it when people dont let people finish she's lucky I had no fingernail and didn't want to get kicked out of the festival, anywhere else I would've banged her. everyone litch agreed with me anyway so she agreed to hush but she was STILL complaining. when she wasn't complaining she was on her phone. she would get mad when I didn't walk beside her but because she was always on her phone while walking she would be walking me into other people and then have a go at me. the whole festival she was chatting shit about B and this other girl C for being miserable but she was genuinely so much worse. she also refused to do any activities and then started complaining saying why didn't we do anything. have a fucking think to yourself then love.

last day I politely asked her to fold one of the layers of my tent to the width of the tent cover and she just rolled it into a ball and just sat there COMPLAINING about coffee. 

anyways onto B. my festival group were mainly strangers to each other, I had met the most people in the group. I was originally going with A and then B and C had separately asked to join me. everyone has to make an effort to get to know each other, there is even people id never met before. on the first days B seemed to get along fine with everyone to an extent. sometimes she would dead the conversation but that was it but she never really made an effort to do stuff with us outside of camp. shed always always go back to camp saying to pace herself but is it really pacing yourself if you're only outside of camp for 3 hours a day. like it actually gets to a point. she started coming out more over the weekend but she looked so miserable and wed point it out saying are you okay but she said its just the way she dances. but because she looks so miserable she also looked like she was alone even when standing with us so this girl took a liking to her trying to take her in. but it was kinda weird because then we'd see the girl around and that's the only time B would be happy. I also met up with my friends from school and 5 minutes later B said im going to meet my friends? she didn't introduce herself just dipped which we all found odd. there was another time B said to me and A oh im going to go back to camp now. we said that well go with you as it will get cold soon so we should get hoodies. she said that's fine. she lead the pact in the complete ( and obviously (walking into a wall)) opposite direction to camp so I had to get them to walk in the right direction as \~A was just trailing after her. anyways we got to a certain point and B just looked back at us and just ran off. weird. anyways on the last day B came to me and had tried to insinuate that I had left her out the whole time. we are all adults, I cannot talk for you do you want me to dance for you. I just think that it was ridiculous considering I couldn't speak so I felt pretty excluded myself.

I just found everyone to be so miserable the whole time and it was so draining because if you dont like it then go home. your an adult. I know if my finger continued to hurt on Thursday I would've gone home so I dont ruin the mood.

onto now. I lost my dead grandmas jewellery
