But I still haven’t had the chance to build it. So I want to share it here, if anyone is interested, just comment below.

I might call it **LittleSmile**, or something like that.  

The core idea is a simple gamification app that gives users small daily quest.

Examples:

* Buy a flower for your wife today.
* Send a warm message to your mom.
* Wash your car this week.
* Give a small donation or lucky money to a homeless.
* Say Hi to a stranger.
* Go to the park with your kids.
* Call an old friend you haven’t spoken to in years.
* Hug your grandma.
* Plant a tiny tree on your desk.
* Buy a coffee for your colleague.

Basically, any small action that makes you smile — or makes someone else smile.

I know if just like that, it’s quite boring and user would leave. It needs to be engaging and social to keep users motivated. So there are some expansions:

You can **share your story** when you complete a quest — anonymously or not. Others can **view stories** and send a “celebration” (like upvotes or karma).

There are achievement system: badges, streaks, leaderboards (maybe), or a “karma tree” that grows with every completed quest (like daily habit drink water apps)

There are so many ways to expand this idea, but I’d rather keep it **simple and meaningful first**.

P/S: I don’t know why my last post was removed, it’s much more detailed than this.

1o4fauv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1o4fauv/i_dont_feel_like_anyone_is_going_to_love_me_i/,i dont feel like anyone is going to love me. i dont know what to do with that,"hi, this is my first time using reddit, and english is not my first language, so im sorry for any mistakes.

ive (21f) been single since birth. ive never had anything beyond a situationship. most of the time i dont think im ugly (not physically or personality-wise) but i dont feel lovable. i have a few close friends, and im a friendly person, so i know a lot of people from my university. i don’t think im hard to talk to, but i feel like people just dont see me as a potential partner. it seems like everyone sees me only as a really good friend, at best.

its important to say that i really enjoy staying at home. i like watching movies and youtube, drinking coffee, reading manga or books, and writing (a hobby of mine). i like spending time alone, so thats what i usually do. i dont enjoy drinking or partying, or using drugs like most people my age, and because of that ive always felt like i dont have a very active social life, but it never really bothered me much.

recently, my best friend (20f) started dating a guy she just met. after a month of dating, she asked me if i thought it was too soon for her to feel like she loves him. i told her the truth; that maybe it was a little fast, but it was fine as long as he felt the same way, she just needed to not rush anything and get to know him better. i also say (kinda as a joke) that my advice might not be the best since ive never dated anyone. she said that i would never date anyone if i didnt go out more.

at first i didnt think much about it, but later i started feeling really sad because i realized she might be right. even if she dindt say it with a bad intention (i lean on think that she say it as an advice), it stuck with me since then. i dont really put myself out there. im not very social (im more of an introvert who gets socially drained just from going to class) and im also really awkward when it comes to flirting. im shy and never know what to do. in high school, i always thought dating wouldn’t be a problem in the future, that id eventually be with someone. but that never happened, and maybe thats my fault.

to clarify, im not writing this as a “nice guy” kind of post, it is not a “im nice, so people are bad for not wanting me.” thats not it. im not blaming anyone else; im blaming myself. i feel like because i wasnt interested in dating back in high school, i missed the chance to learn and experience relationships. and now that i \*am\* interested, i just dont know how or where to start one. i dont know how to flirt, how to show interest, or how to recognize when someone might like me. i just dont know how any of this works, and it makes me feel ashamed, especially when my friends talk about their partners or exes, and i have nothing to add.

i know im young, and im not expecting to meet the love of my life right now. but i cant think of a single time when someone liked me and i liked them back. not even once. im afraid that maybe im just not the kind of person people find attractive in a romantic way. it makes me sad because i really want to feel loved, and to love someone too. i dont think im a bad, stupid, or ugly person. i dont even think i'd be boring to date. i just feel like i might be responsible for my lack of romantic experiences; because i wasnt interested before, maybe i unknowingly took away my own chances to love and be loved for ever. i dont know what im doing wrong, if its something in my personality or if i just dont have experience in it, but i dont feel like anyone has ever loved me in that sense and it just destroys my self-esteem. it makes me believe that im not made for being love romanticlly and thats why no one has been interested in dating me.

im sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this kind of post. im just venting here because i feel ashamed for having these thoughts and feelings, and i dont really know where or with whom to share them. i havent really been able to talk this through with anyone. my therapist knows its a problem, but we havent really discussed it with her yet (every time we bring this topic up, i cry so hard that i cant even talk. so its kind of stuck for now. i also cry writing this). i mentioned it to a friend once, and she said she wanted to take me to a gay bar to ""try to hook up with someone,"" but i declined because i really dont think this is something i can solve that way, i have kissed people and even had sex before, its not that im completely inexperienced but this issue is more about the romantic aspect.

Forget the fruity bombs, I just want something that's so good that would leave me wanting more or make me want to buy their beans.

I know I'm being a tad dramatic saying the above, but I've just had it with pourovers from places that have earned high praise from this sub and other places (i.e., SEY, Devociòn, etc).

I did two caffeine crawls in NYC (Manhattan/Brooklyn) and Chicago and both times, I was disappointed and a little discouraged too that maybe my plate is still not experienced/highly refined enough, so it's my fault that I'm not experiencing what others have been raving about. Almost all of the p/o coffees I've had were muted in flavor and divorced from their tasting notes. Here are the places I've visited:

New York: 
- SEY ($29 for a Panamian coffee using Aeropress)
- La Cabra 
- % Arabica 
- Devocion
- Bean and Bean
- Suited
- Coffee Project
- Qahwah House
- 787  coffee

Chicago
- Metric
- Dayglow
- Dark Matter
- Intelligentsia 
- Drip Collective 
- Side Practice
- Starbucks Roastery 
- Del Sur Bakery

Some are probably roasters first and cafes second. But I was hoping their cafes will be a good showcase for their beans, just like Glitch in Japan (haven't tried their cafes, but have brewed great cups using their beans). From all the places above, La Cabra probably came closest to producing the best cup. In fairness Qahwah and Coffee Project both served good milk-based coffees too. 

It'll probably be awhile since I visit those places again, if ever. (The expense is a disincentive too LOL.) Of course, maybe I just have to try the coffee scenes in Portland and Seattle, select cities in California and Florida, to get a good pourover???",5,1760240836.0,pourover,5,0.78,False

I could be told something and forget it thirty seconds later. Or, I’d suddenly pause and realize I couldn’t remember the last few minutes at all. 

It happened today. I was really busy serving tables, and I was making coffee. I totally get forgetting one drink out of several or forgetting which table I’m supposed to go to. 

But I felt like my memory had been wiped blank or like I’d just landed in the moment after someone jolted me out. I knew which table I was serving, but I tried to replay their words so I could recall why I was serving two coffees. Usually I can, but this time I couldn’t. It was a very strange sensation. 

I’m not sure how to explain it. There’s forgetting something that slips your mind. And then there’s whatever this is. Maybe I’m overreacting. Maybe I was just out of it cuz I hadn’t eaten all day, and I’d been working on my feet after being sick with an upset stomach. 

But if that were true, I wouldn’t have a habit of forgetting since I was a kid. My mom said it was an issue. She also said she I  have trouble/she was worried I’d have trouble with several instructions at a time— probably because I’d forget part if I got several instructions at a time. But I feel like there wouldn’t be a general issue of this if it were just about instructions.

Let me share what I’ve learned. Spoiler alert: both are awesome, just in different ways!

### Gentle Morning Stretches 🌅

Plus internships and jobs for juniors,"TLDR: hosting an event where we’re working with Unimelb and creating a fake online social media platform seeded with spicy personas like manosphere influencers, conspiracy theorists, body dysmorphia groups, some LinkedIn Lunatics and others. Fun event where you’ll build something that can identify these personas and make the internet a bit safer and less toxic for everyone. 2 of the main sponsors are offering internships early 2026 and are hiring for 18 junior dev roles.

Hey unimelb peeps, alum here. I’m putting on a hackathon with Unimelb and Aus Gov eSafety commissioner around cleaning up the internet. I’m posting because I know how INSANELY hard it’s becoming to find junior roles and internships these days. The hack will be fun plus there are 2 sponsors offering internships early next year and have 18 roles open for juniors in EdTech, AI and eSafety.

Here’s the full spiel for the event: Not sure if you’ve noticed but the internet is becoming a crazy place. We’ve got manosphere influencers, conspiracy theorists, misinfo and disinfo, social media bans for children and teens, that Netflix show ‘Adolescence’, and it’s getting harder to tell what’s AI slop. So I’m putting on an event with the Australian Governments eSafety Commissioner, and University of Melbourne as part of the “16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence” campaign in November.

It’s a fun event where we’ll come together and we’ll learn about these groups and build something that can help us identify these personas and hopefully work towards making the internet safer/better.

There’ll be big prizes, catering, free coffee and it’s hosted in Melbourne CBD Nov 29-30.

I’ve put a lot of work into making it fun, survivor friendly and enlightening so please give it a look! Even if you don’t end up coming please just give it a look :)

We went out for the day for our wedding anniversary.  Pumpkin patch fun. Mainly window shopping but I did buy things I needed for my classroom. Lots of laughs and fun times.

We ate dinner at Cheddars. It was very good a little pricey for my taste. The only time we spend big out to eat is his birthday and our Christmas dinner at a certain restaurant we love.

We came home made love twice and relaxed with a few movies. I started chugging water afterwards. Because earlier in the day I saw a text on his phone from his best friend asking help fixing something in his house. My husband can't say no to helping out family and friends so I knew he'd be leaving soon and he did. 

So after he left drank more water. Did laundry. Cleaned up some areas in the house. Got the carpet cleaner ready.

💦💦The next part is NSFW and contains my kink incase you wanna stop here.💦💦

I went to my office area. Laid down some newspaper and turned on some music took my clothes off and started dancing. If you never tried just naked sensual dancing by yourself you should its a good self love kinda exercise.

I was just letting myself go my hair down. Rubbing all of my body that I love and deserves attention. I began playing with my nipples and rubbing my pussy. I laid on the newspaper grabbed my dildo and started going to town within a minute my bladder gave up the fight and I started pissing everywhere. I lifted my self up to spray as much on myself as possible. I tried to imagine different scenarios while it was going on.
When it was done I was wet. The floor was wet. I lay and masturbated a few more times. Got up washed my toy, threw the paper away, showered, then cleaned the carpet. Went ahead and cleaned two spots in the livingroom where hubby spilled coffee too. Then I read some of my book and fell asleep. It was a great escape from the week.

While I've been getting my t2 under control, what I drink has been pretty limited to Black Coffee, tea and water. I also have a Boost - Glucose control once in a while, but even those move the needle up a bit.  I even posted the question [What are things to add to coffee, without sugar or Substitutes? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1ms6h75/what_are_things_to_add_to_coffee_without_sugar_or/) in  ""NoStupidQuestions"" and received some great answers.  Coffee, tea and a little boost once in a while is getting boring though. I need more...

I am hoping we can share other drinking options that we've found that don't spike our numbers. This way we aren't all going out and spending a ton of money to see what works or not. All the replies may not work for everyone, but at least it may narrow our search down to some great options and save us a few bucks too.

I haven't tried too much myself yet. I DID try a OliPop- Cream Soda (OMG, I loved Cream Soda), and it didn't seem to do anything to my numbers, but I want to do a little more research on it before I start guzzling them down. 

Anyone else find some satisfying drinks that don't spike the numbers?

1o4etu5,https://v.redd.it/kmex6mdmoluf1,Moka pot beginner. Need advice/suggestions for improvement.,"Hello everyone.
I recently purchased a Budan 2-cup stainless steel moka pot. I had been using a 1-cup South Indian filter (SiF) for the past 3 months (after getting suggestions from this sub and really liked it over the instant coffee).

I have attached a video of the first flow I got from this moka pot. I used it on an induction (with lowest temp. Setting) and used the Sleepy Owl coffee sampler pack.
Will appreciate if I can get answers to below questions and suggestions for improvement.

1) For a single cup milk based coffee, how much coffee powder should be filled in the basket ? Does the basket need to be filled upto the brim ?

2) The amount of decoction I am getting from the moka pot is very less as compared to SiF. The coffee becomes very light when I add milk (same amount of milk as I use for SiF). Is it normal to get less decoction in moka pot ?

3) I have observed sediments in the moka pot coffee but I didn't observe any in the SiF. Do I need to add a filter paper in the pot while brewing ? Will it also help to increase the brewing pressure ?

4) Almost half of the water is left inside the moka pot after brewing. Is it normal or the temperature is not enough to convert all the water to steam ?

5) The coffe tastes bad as compared to SiF. Maybe it is because of the Sleepy Owl coffee powder. What other brands I can explore ?",2,1760239870.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False

I got more nauseous later and actually threw up. Still didn’t feel better after. Then I started vomiting even more. Like a lot to the point of just bile. But then I felt better finally and went to sleep it off. Woke up again and I’m no longer nauseous.

1o4epap,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o4epap,Rolife Street Scene,"Pics \[Day lighting, night lighting, closeup Day lighting, closeup night lighting, left interior, side w/mini scene, top view during the build\]

I did very little customization: painted edges, added some metallic highlights, and in the mini subway scene I added a few small paper fliers & painted the middle of the clock a glossy white. I wish I had darkened the edges of the train tracks but they are stuck to the base now and I don't want to risk ripping them. I chose not to add the coffee cup & bag to the front piece. Fun note: they add 2 different striped canopy colors for the central building.  I chose blue but they included red version as well. I enjoy the  finished look, but you could easily add some graffiti, flyers, shrubbery etc.

The pieces fit together well, and the few times where I realized I skipped a step \[this was done over several nights\] it was very easy to go back and correct the issue. Barring my forgetting where I stopped, the directions were easy to follow. They include tiny arrows on the pieces to help determine the right direction. Several size adhesive strips are included.  I chose to use glue for a few steps but it is not needed. You start with building the mini subway scene, then the stairs, streets, and buildings.  There are a few mirrors placed to help reflect the lighting. The sky  is an extra long piece of card stock that curves from the back along the top and is anchored to the roof with a mini cloud. The dust cover fits into a slot on the top & the tab to grab it is hidden behind the ""Street Scene"" sign. 

Lighting:  As you can see it has 2 lighting options.  The battery box fits snug in the bottom of the kit.  You attach 2 separate bulbs to achieve the different lighting effects.  The touch pad is screwed to the inside of the front piece.  The wires go along the top left & back of the kit and are held in place with attachments.

For me, the tricky parts were lining up the black arches that go across the streets.  You insert one end to the central building and then when you attach the sides you need to insert the other ends in to quite small slots.  It wasn't terrible as the paper is sturdy and flexible but you do need good tweezers to accomplish it! There were also some stickers that adhered to wooden pieces which created glossy, colored canopies for the other buildings. I was not great at lining up the stickers but you could peel & re-position a few times to get it right. Other than that I would recommend some glue to the mini tree/streetlight next to the central building. You can see in some of my pictures it became dislodged as I rotated the kit to add later pieces etc.  I am going to glue it to the top of the canopy so it won't shift around in the future.

I think this might be one of my favorite 2d builds.  I love the different angles (stairs going up, street goes uphill on one-side & down on the other) and the lighting options.  The only thing I wish they had done was add some lighting to the subway scene!",3,1760239466.0,booknooks,1,1.0,False

1o4ejji,https://v.redd.it/bnw9xzz4mluf1,Internships and junior dev roles coming up,"TLDR: hosting an event where we’re creating a fake online social media platform seeded with spicy personas like manosphere influencers, conspiracy theorists, body dysmorphia groups, some LinkedIn Lunatics and others. Fun event where you’ll build something that can identify these personas and make the internet a bit safer and less toxic for everyone. 2 of the main sponsors are offering internships early 2026 and are hiring for 18 junior dev roles. 

Hey CS peeps, will have a few internships and junior dev roles coming up for one of the sponsors that’s sponsoring this Melbourne event. I’m posting because I know how INSANELY hard it’s becoming to find junior roles these days. 


Here’s the full spiel for the event: Not sure if you’ve noticed but the internet is becoming a crazy place. We’ve got manosphere influencers, conspiracy theorists, misinfo and disinfo, social media bans for children and teens, that Netflix show ‘Adolescence’, and it’s getting harder to tell what’s AI slop. So I’m putting on an event with the Australian Governments eSafety Commissioner, and University of Melbourne as part of the “16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence” campaign in November.

It’s a fun event where we’ll come together and we’ll learn about these groups and build something that can help us identify these personas and hopefully work towards making the internet safer/better.

There’ll be big prizes, catering, free coffee and it’s hosted in Melbourne CBD Nov 29-30.

I’ve put a lot of work into making it fun, survivor friendly and enlightening so please give it a look! Even if you don’t end up coming please just give it a look :)

I think love lives in the little things: laughing until it hurts, holding hands on late-night walks, or splitting dessert while pretending we’re “too full.”

About me:

Food is my love language. Cooking, trying new spots, or just indulging in comfort food all make me happy.

I’m a lover of stories: books, anime, games, and travel. Basically anything that lets me escape into a new world.

I’m a huge nerd for Tokusatsu - if it’s got heroes, suits, and over-the-top explosions, I’m there cheering like a kid again.

I collect physical media because Wi-Fi can fail but my Blu-rays won’t.

I’m laid-back, affectionate, a little goofy, and believe love should be both playful and meaningful.

What I’m hoping for:
Someone kind, thoughtful, and down to build something lasting. I imagine stargazing together, rainy afternoons curled up under a blanket, and mornings that start with coffee but somehow turn into adventures. Bonus points if you don’t mind my bad puns or will hype me up while I try to bake cookies that may or may not come out edible.

1o4ehzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/comments/1o4ehzz/ultimate_packing_list_trekking_tips_for_nepal/,"Ultimate Packing List & Trekking Tips for Nepal (10-20 days Edition, Sept–Oct)","Hey everyone!
I  wanted to share my comprehensive packing list + real-world tips for anyone planning to trek in Nepal.

This guide applies not only to EBC + Gokyo, but also Annapurna Circuit, Manaslu Circuit, and Langtang Valley. As a trekking guide, everything listed was used, tested, and worked — no unnecessary extras.

🎒 Overview

A typical trek lasts 10–20 days, ranging from warm valleys to above 5,000m passes. The key is to pack light but smart.

Bag weight: ~9–11kg

👕 Clothing Layers

Base layers:

3 shirts (1 merino wool, 2 synthetic quick-dry)

1 long sleeve merino top

1 thicker merino wool long sleeve (for cold mornings)

1 set of thermal top & bottom (for cold nights)

1 fleece pullover

1 light trackpant for tea houses


Outer layers:

Puffer/down jacket (essential)

Waterproof + windproof shell

Waterproof pants (for rain/snow days)

Trekking pants (zip-off style = great versatility)


Footwear:

Hiking boots: Merrell Moab 3 Mid GTX (loved these 👌)

Flip flops for evenings

Thick merino hiking socks x2–3

Sleep socks (non-cotton)


💡 Tip: Don’t skimp on socks — thin ones = blisters!


🧤 Accessories

Warm beanie + sun hat

Buffs (1 warm, 1 light)

Gloves (inner + outer/ski gloves)

Sunglasses (UV400 or glacier-rated)

Trekking poles (super useful on descents)

Head torch (with spare batteries)

---

💧 Hydration & Health

2× 1L bottles or hydration bladder

Water purification tablets / drops / filter

Electrolytes

Hand sanitizer (bring at least 2–3 small bottles)

Basic first aid kit (band-aids, blister pads, Diamox, painkillers, etc.)

Probiotics (start a week before your trek — trust me, helps!)

---

🧴 Toiletries

Toothbrush & toothpaste

Biodegradable soap/shampoo bar

Sunscreen SPF 50+ & lip balm

Moisturizer (dry air = cracked skin)

Wet wipes + small towel

Menstrual hygiene products (for women)

---

🔋 Tech & Charging

Power bank (bring a strong one!)

Universal adapter

Charging cables

Extra camera/headlamp batteries


⚡ Charging gets expensive above — up to 300 NPR for a full charge.

---

🍫 Snacks & Nutrition

Protein bars / nuts / chocolates

Electrolytes

Instant coffee / tea (optional)

---

💰 Money & Permits

Last ATM: Namche Bazaar

Bring 40,000–50,000 NPR cash for 2–3 weeks (water, snacks, hot showers, charging, etc.)

Trekking permits (usually arranged by your agency)

Passport + copies

Insurance (must cover 6,000m altitude + helicopter evacuation)


💡 Nepal’s trails are cash-based — keep small notes handy.


---

🏕️ Gear to Buy or Rent in Nepal

Best places: Thamel (Kathmandu) & Namche Bazaar

🛍️ Items worth buying/renting locally:

Down jacket

Sleeping bag (-20°C)

Trekking poles

Microspikes/crampons (for Pass)

Buffs, gloves, and hats

Water purification tablets

Knock-off Nalgene bottles (they actually work great!)


💡 Thamel “bounce test” — locals throw bottles on the ground to prove quality 😆


---

🧼 Hygiene & Comfort

Showers: 500–800 NPR; rare above.

Most trekkers shower only 2–3 times total.

Wet wipes = your best friend.

Bring a small towel (tea houses rarely provide one).

---

🧠 Health & Altitude Tips

Hydrate (3L/day minimum)

Go slow — altitude sickness hits the impatient

Avoid alcohol above Namche

Garlic soup + lemon ginger honey tea are your natural friends

“Climb high, sleep low” whenever possible

Consult your doctor about Diamox before your trek

---

✈️ Buffer Days Are Crucial

Flights to/from Lukla are unpredictable.
Add 4-6 buffer days total

If flights get canceled:

You might need to take a 2-day jeep + trek route to Lukla.

Or pay for a helicopter (can cost $1,000+ per person)


💡 Buffer days = peace of mind + extra shopping time in Kathmandu.


---

💵 Tipping

They work incredibly hard — don’t forget them ❤️

Guide: $10–15/day

Porter: $7–10/day


Tip at the end in cash. It’s their livelihood.

---

💉 Vaccinations & Medications

Recommended (check with your doctor):

Typhoid

Hepatitis A & B

Rabies

Tetanus booster

Optional: Japanese Encephalitis


---

🧘 Final Advice

Train with a weighted pack before your trek.

Pack light — every 100g counts at 5,000m.

Layer up: mornings/evenings freeze, afternoons burn.

Respect local culture (ask before photos, greet with “Namaste 🙏”).

Take it slow, breathe deep, and enjoy every single view.


🪷 Final Thoughts

This packing list served perfectly for 2-3 weeks on the trail after September till november.

I used everything I packed and didn’t feel underprepared once.

We'll be experiencing the mysterious town of Twin Peaks in the following order:

1. Season 1 - where it all began...with coffee, pie, and something terrible in the woods.

2. Season 2 - where dreams deepen, shadows grow long, and the owls are not what they seem.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Utah State Aggies vs. Hawaii Rainbow Warriors: A Clash of Leaks and Laughs**

**Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game**  
The betting lines paint a clear picture: Utah State (-1.5) is the favorite, with moneyline odds hovering around 1.83-1.85 (implied probability \~52-54%), while Hawaii (+1.5) sits at even money (2.0). The total is pegged at 57 points, with bookmakers hedging slightly on the Under. Statistically, this suggests a low-scoring grind—perfect for fans who enjoy seeing teams fumble through their own footwork.

Utah State’s offense is a leaky faucet that somehow still fills the glass: 36.4 points per game, led by Bryson Barnes’ dual-threat magic (1,143 yards passing, 245 rushing) and Miles Davis’ versatility (314 rushing, 128 receiving). Their defense? A sieve with a LinkedIn page—allowing 30.4 points and 413 yards per game. Hawaii, meanwhile, is a paradox: a passing attack that shimmers (275.5 yards per game) paired with a rushing game slower than a sloth on a coffee break (93.3 YPG). Their defense? Decent against the pass (187.7 YPG allowed) but porous against the run (128.3 YPG)—ideal if you’re a team that never runs the ball.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Trends, and Micah Alejado’s Existential Crisis**  
Utah State enters this matchup unscathed, save for the existential dread of facing a Hawaii team that’s improved defensively. Their key strength? Senior linebacker John Miller, who leads the team with 48 tackles and 5 sacks—enough to make a quarterback question their life choices. The Aggies’ success hinges on pressuring Micah Alejado, Hawaii’s QB, whose 57 rushing yards and 6 TDs are offset by 4 interceptions. If Utah State’s pass rush turns Alejado into a human piñata, the Rainbow Warriors’ offense (which relies heavily on pass protection) could implode faster than a house of cards in a hurricane.

Hawaii’s recent improvements are promising, but their rushing woes are as dire as a vegan at a steakhouse. Without a consistent ground game, they’ll force Alejado to carry the load—something he’s done admirably (1,043 passing y

1o4edoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1o4edoy/how_i_learned_the_hard_way_not_to_ignore_my/,How I learned the hard way not to ignore my instinct after my husband fell in love with another woman under my own nose.,"I’m not really looking for advice. I just need to get this out. It’s been months since I found out, and even though I’ve been trying to heal and focus on myself, the pain still lingers. Maybe writing it down will help me breathe a little.

I won’t get into too many details in case someone recognizes me, but… I’m in my 30s, so is my husband. We’ve been together for eight years, married recently, even bought a house together.

For the longest time, I thought cheating was something that could never happen to us. I really believed he only had eyes for me, that we were solid.

In the early years, I struggled a lot with insecurity. I’d overthink things, check his phone, make small problems bigger than they were. But eventually, I learned that kind of behavior only destroys trust.

So I worked on myself: I stopped checking, stopped accusing, stopped feeding the fear.

Whenever jealousy tried to creep in, I reminded myself: he loves you, you’re safe.

And honestly, things were good for a while. Until recently.

There was this coworker. Someone I’d heard of before. Back then, she was in a long-term relationship, so I never thought twice about it. But when she broke up with her boyfriend, she started leaning on my husband a lot. She’d call him, tell him she needed someone to talk to, someone who understood.

And I was fine with that. I didn’t want to be controlling or jealous. I wanted to be the “secure” wife, the one who trusts.

So when he told me he was texting her or meeting her for coffee, I didn’t freak out.

I told myself, there was nothing to worry about. I even encouraged him to reach out to her as I had gone through something similar and I understood what she was going through.

I even met her! She was friendly, loud, kind of flirtatious, but harmless. I honestly didn't perceive any interest from her for my husband. I though we were safe.

Things changed, though, once I went out of town. I often go to visit my family who lives in another city close to ours, and my husband came with me whenever possible but he couldn't always come. My friends told me not to leave him alone for so much time, but I disregarded this. My husband, although not happy about the amount of time I left, was ok with this too. 

So I'm there with my family. Everything's normal: he calls me everyday, sends memes, funny videos, text messages...But one day, I called him and he said he was having breakfast with her. Hours later, I called again and he was still with her. This time, at her place.

That’s when I felt it, what I had tried to ignore and appease could not be ignored anymore.

Still, I pushed it down. I told myself I was being dramatic because when confronted by this, my husband made it seem like it was all innocent and I was the one making it look tainted. So, again, I went against my better judgement, and decided to leave it alone.

When I finally came back home, he acted like everything was normal. He hugged me, kissed me, made love to me, like nothing had changed.

But a few days later, I overheard him on the phone with her.

His voice was soft, different, the kind you only use when you are just falling for someone. He had just finished talking with her when he took his phone, glanced at me guiltily and went to the back of our house to get the laundry. That's when I lost it. As soon as he came back, I asked for his phone and went straight to recent calls and, of course, it was her phone number.

I confronted him, he denied it at first, then got angry at me because I was making a big scene.

But later, he admitted enough. He said he had feelings for her. That he didn’t feel the same about me anymore. But, and here’s the part that breaks me, he also said he didn’t want to lose me.

That she didn’t feel the same way about him. That everything is only from his side. I don’t know if that’s true.

So now we’re here. He says he wants to work on the marriage, but he still works with her, still sees her.

He says he can't stop these feelings he has for her despite the time they haven't seen each other. I made him lose contact, although he has admitted they have seen each other when I'm not present because ""she doesn't know what he feels for her"".

And I feel like I’m fighting for something that’s already half gone.

We’re supposed to start couples therapy soon. It was my idea, not his. Some nights, I pray. Other nights, I just cry until I fall asleep. But the one thing I’m trying to hold onto is this: This wasn’t my fault.

I gave him love, patience, trust, everything I could. If anyone failed, it wasn’t me.

I don’t know if our marriage will survive. But I know I will.",42,1760238438.0,TrueOffMyChest,17,0.89,False

I've been here for more than a month already. I had no choice kay dinhi gyud ko naassign sa work. Naa moy masuggest for the following?

**A. Grocery (?)**

\- I used to live in Manila and Davao and I have noticed how crazy expensive Alturas Markets are. Even 4-peso price difference kay crazy nagyud. And their gardenia breads are priced at 120+ pesos when it's only 80+ pesos ragyud. Di kaha sila magabaan ana no? LOL anyway, I've tried BQ sa tagbilaran and i noticed nga cheap gyud didto. But naa ba moy ma-suggest around here ra sa Panglao that is not alturas? Kay expensive pud pamasahe from Panglao to Tagbi IMO.

\- Nag buy pod ko sa wet market sa poblacion and kaduha gyud ko naka-buy ug chicken na naguba dayon after 2 days maski naka fridge (this may also be on me but it looked and smelled okay when I bought it). Naa moy masuggest where it's safe to buy meat? Or any advice how to choose a fresh meat?

**B. Coffee Shops**

**-** Any decent coffee shops you can suggest? I tried ***overgrown coffee*** kay mao usually suggestions dinhi but I did not like it at all. Grabe ka way lami sa matcha and their sourdough breads? Grabe ka dry and unsavory huhuhu. Any place that is chill unta nga lami sad. Preferrably naay wifi for WFH peeps and somewhere pwede ra mag read books!

**C. Beaches/Tambay Spot**

\- I've been to Alona. Wala kaayo tao when I went there but mej baho sya when I went there basi due to monsoon season ra pod na mas langsa gyud sya at this time of the year (?) Langsa man gyud ang dagat pero OA ra pod when I went there. Idk but you guys can educate me on this! Somewhere to chill ra and not actually swim hihi

**D. Driving school and where to buy motorcycle**

**-** acknowledging how crazy expensive gyud ang pamasahe dinhi, ga-plan gyud ko mag buy ug motor. the problem is wala pakoy license. diba need man now ug driving school cert para makakuha license sa LTO? naa moy masuggest na driving schools? kay mag apil na lang pud unta ko learn ug car para kaisa na lang ko magkuha lisensya. can you also tell how much ilang rates? thank you!

\- also where to buy a motorcycle nga dili hasol and dili dugay makuha ang OR/CR?

**E. Where to rent**

**-** naa moy masuggest nga marentahan nga place? I think normal price ra guro dinhi ang 10k+ for a studio unit but it's expensive for me given I have lived in both mindanao and luzon nga 1 bedroom/2 bedroom na for an even lower price. Do you know a place nga di ra pud guro maabot ug 10k ang monthly rent and dili ra pod kaayo sudlonon gyud?

thank you kaayo!!! and if you have any advice in how to survive here (wow zombie apocalypse yarn), i'll be very open to it.

I currently have a microwave, toaster, Nespresso coffee machine and milk frother, and modem in the same corner of my kitchen. It’s an old apartment and the only power outlet is behind the sink, on the other side of the room. I don’t have much counter space for small appliances on that side of the kitchen and avoid using that outlet because cords can easily fall into the sink too. The closest power outlet to said coffee machine/microwave area still requires a surge protector or power strip, but I recently found out plugging small appliances into one isn’t recommended. 

Is there any way of safely doing so?  For what it’s worth, the closest outlet is underneath a nearby desk and has a computer and monitor plugged into its own surge protector, using one of the two plugs on said outlet.

I (29M) just moved to Salt Lake City yesterday and I’ll be here for about 3 months.

A bit about me:

I love outdoor stuff — things like pickleball, badminton, hikes, or really any kind of casual sport.

I’m also into board games, chill game nights, or just hanging out with good conversation.

I’m open to joining local groups, pickup games, or meeting people who want to grab a coffee and swap stories.


If anyone’s organizing something or wouldn’t mind a new face tagging along, I’d love to join!
Also open to recommendations for:
☕️ cozy coffee spots
🥾 local hikes

1o4e4ne,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildfreeIndia/comments/1o4e4ne/29m_hyderabad/,"29M, Hyderabad","I’m 29, from Hyderabad.
Life didn’t go in a straight line for me. I dropped out of college years ago, worked, learned along the way, and recently completed my degree. The last few months were dramatic but in a good way. I finally feel like I’m restarting everything… career, priorities, and the way I see life.

I’m the kind of person who mixes logic with emotion. I overthink a lot, even small things like spreadsheets.
I really hate when anger or impulse take over on anyone. My brain’s curious and gets distracted, but I love learning new things.

I eat mostly vegetarian, don’t drink anything (not even tea or coffee).

I like kids but I’ve chosen to stay childfree. Parenting feels like a huge emotional, financia. I’d rather live simply, travel, stay close to nature, temples and not follow every “default” milestone.

Long term, I want to work towards FIRE (financial independence, retire early). My income isn’t huge right now, but I’m focused and patient.
One of my dreams after retirement is to start a small farm and live surrounded by trees, away from the city. That thought really keeps me going. Love traveling to place with lot of trees. 

Long part for nerds - 
I still need time to grow financially. The way I was brought up made me believe that to have people around me, I needed to look a certain way, earn well, or have some special skill. My family is loving and kind, but for some reason it has always been hard for me to see or feel them that way. Over time, I slowly pulled away from everyone and never really built strong friendships either. I realised having people around you is fun if you are don't have to act.

Earlier I thought I could only post once I have stable 60k+ income, but real connections don’t happen instantly. For someone like me, both financial stability and emotional trust take time.

I don’t know if this is right or wrong, but I feel having a partner makes life better in many ways. By a good partner, I mean someone who sees the other person the same way they see themselves. The same likeness, respect, freedom, and sense of self. Most people have barriers when they talk to others. They worry about what the other person will think or whether something will be accepted. But they rarely put those same thoughts on themselves. Am extreme example - If someone want to commit Adultery, they run those thoughts freely in their brain right,now imagine that someone could talk about this with their partner. I don't mean to commit adultery, but this is the level of freedom a couple should have to stay happy in a relationship. It’s like having an “extra me” in life.

Humans are born with only two fears. Almost all other fears and likes are learned from the way we grow up. When you like someone, you bend your world a little towards them. When someone wants you, they bend theirs too. I feel this is what makes the difference between couples who stay happy and those who grow apart. It’s not a formula, just a kind of magic that only works when both people trust each other deeply.

I’m looking for someone who’s also childfree, emotionally balanced, has a sense of humour, and prefers peace over drama. Yelling or anger really affects me, and I don’t want that in my life anymore. I take time to trust because of my past, but I’m genuine and loyal. I want to build something real, start with friendship, and see where it goes.",8,1760237637.0,ChildfreeIndia,1,0.9,False

ive (21f) been single since birth. ive never had anything beyond a situationship. most of the time i dont think im ugly (not physically or personality-wise) but i dont feel lovable. i have a few close friends, and im a friendly person, so i know a lot of people from my university. i don’t think im hard to talk to, but i feel like people just dont see me as a potential partner. it seems like everyone sees me only as a really good friend, at best.

its important to say that i really enjoy staying at home. i like watching movies and youtube, drinking coffee, reading manga or books, and writing (a hobby of mine). i like spending time alone, so thats what i usually do. i dont enjoy drinking or partying, or using drugs like most people my age, and because of that ive always felt like i dont have a very active social life, but it never really bothered me much.

recently, my best friend (20f) started dating a guy she just met. after a month of dating, she asked me if i thought it was too soon for her to feel like she loves him. i told her the truth; that maybe it was a little fast, but it was fine as long as he felt the same way, she just needed to not rush anything and get to know him better. i also say (kinda as a joke) that my advice might not be the best since ive never dated anyone. she said that i would never date anyone if i didnt go out more.

at first i didnt think much about it, but later i started feeling really sad because i realized she might be right. even if she dindt say it with a bad intention (i lean on think that she say it as an advice), it stuck with me since then. i dont really put myself out there. im not very social (im more of an introvert who gets socially drained just from going to class) and im also really awkward when it comes to flirting. im shy and never know what to do. in high school, i always thought dating wouldn’t be a problem in the future, that id eventually be with someone. but that never happened, and maybe thats my fault.

to clarify, im not writing this as a “nice guy” kind of post, it is not a “im nice, so people are bad for not wanting me.” thats not it. im not blaming anyone else; im blaming myself. i feel like because i wasnt interested in dating back in high school, i missed the chance to learn and experience relationships. and now that i \*am\* interested, i just dont know how or where to start one. i dont know how to flirt, how to show interest, or how to recognize when someone might like me. i just dont know how any of this works, and it makes me feel ashamed, especially when my friends talk about their partners or exes, and i have nothing to add.

i know im young, and im not expecting to meet the love of my life right now. but i cant think of a single time when someone liked me and i liked them back. not even once. im afraid that maybe im just not the kind of person people find attractive in a romantic way. it makes me sad because i really want to feel loved, and to love someone too. i dont think im a bad, stupid, or ugly person. i dont even think i'd be boring to date. i just feel like i might be responsible for my lack of romantic experiences; because i wasnt interested before, maybe i unknowingly took away my own chances to love and be loved for ever. i dont know what im doing wrong, if its something in my personality or if i just dont have experience in it, but i dont feel like anyone has ever loved me in that sense and it just destroys my self-esteem. it makes me believe that im not made for being love romanticlly and thats why no one has been interested in dating me.

im sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this kind of post. im just venting here because i feel ashamed for having these thoughts and feelings, and i dont really know where or with whom to share them. i havent really been able to talk this through with anyone. my therapist knows its a problem, but we havent really discussed it with her yet (every time we bring this topic up, i cry so hard that i cant even talk. so its kind of stuck for now. i also cry writing this). i mentioned it to a friend once, and she said she wanted to take me to a gay bar to ""try to hook up with someone,"" but i declined because i really dont think this is something i can solve that way, i have kissed people and even had sex before, its not that im completely inexperienced but this issue is more about the romantic aspect.

sorry again for the long post, any kind of advice would be appreciated. thanks",2,1760237485.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,1.0,False

Recently, he was hired dito sa coffee shop na to and it was really what he wanted kasi maraming gastos ngayong 4th year. Aside from he's also doing part time as coordinator sa events, this is his first time to work as a barista. It was great of course at first, na eenjoy nya and I can really see it however he had sudden breakdown na lang last week. He said hindi niya raw alam kung bakit bigla na lang siyang umiyak, bumisita ako sa kanya that night and dinalahan sya ng foods, naluluha na raw siya nung makita ako pero pinigilan lang niya. It was brief lang kasi marami silang costumers that time. Tapos kagabi lang masyado niya atang dinamdam yung sermon sa kanila ng boss nya. He was asked paano gawin yung isang menu then na mental block sya pero alam nya naman daw paano. I said na sermon is a normal part sa work and that valid naman yung naramdaman niya since di pa naman siya masyadong matagal dun. I humbly ask po for other advices I can give para gumaan pakiramdam niya. Thank you in advance po!! ",1,1760237283.0,adviceph,1,1.0,False

I know watery espresso is a common issue, but none of the guides I was reading were mentioning a puddle of water on top of grounds in the portafilter.

I'm now the proud owner of a Bambino, but my setup is currently incomplete when it comes to an actual grinder which I think is my issue - wanted to get some advice so I didn't go trying to fix the wrong issue, lol. When I pulled my first shots, they came out incredibly watery and when I pulled the portafilter off, there was a little puddle of water on top of the grounds that didn't quite get through. I did commit a major sin by grabbing the finest ground beans I could off the shelf on my way home from work, which is why I'm leaning towards the grind being the issue, but I was also curious if maybe tamping too hard could have anything to do with it because I also think I went pretty heavy handed lol.

There's a local spot where they do all of their coffee roasting and grinding in house + you can buy actually ground beans specifically for espresso by the bag, so I'm planning on hitting them up tomorrow regardless while I peruse for a good compact grinder. To those much more experienced than I, does this sound like a grind specific problem or should I relax a little when it comes to my tamping?

	•	The video (or short series) was titled “The Blah Witch”.
	•	Each segment began with a parody disclaimer shown on a computer screen before the footage started (something like “This is a parody” or similar legal-style text).
	•	It was a low-budget, early-internet parody of The Blair Witch Project — not a TV sketch or DVD anthology. I likely saw it around 1999–2002, possibly through iFilm, AtomFilms, eBaum’s World, CollegeHumor, AlbinoBlacksheep, or a personal webpage.
	•	The main character was a guy in a wig imitating Heather Donahue from the original film.
	•	He does a fake crying scene, visibly squeezing eye drops into his eyes to simulate tears.
	•	The “stick figures” hanging in the forest were popsicle sticks with coffee cup lids for heads.
	•	There’s a moment where he says something like “I wish I could find my car”, and the camera pans to reveal the car is literally down the hill behind him.
	•	Instead of a tent scene, there’s a bathtub scene — he’s in a tub with the shower curtain closed, parodying the Blair Witch tension.
	•	It ends with the crew entering a fancy house, where the tone changes into a real estate–style house tour, describing features like “open floor plan” and “great lighting.”

❌ What It’s Not
	•	Not The Bogus Witch Project (Pauly Shore anthology, 2000)
	•	Not The Scooby-Doo Project
	•	Not Scary Movie, MADtv, or Da Hip Hop Witch
	•	Definitely looked independent or web-made, possibly by a small comedy group or film students.

🔍 Why It Matters

This parody circulated briefly online in the early web-video era, right when sites like iFilm and AtomFilms hosted amateur shorts before YouTube existed. Many of those files are now missing due to domain shutdowns or lost archives. Identifying The Blah Witch could help recover an early example of web-native comedy parodying found-footage horror.

🙏 What I’m Looking For
	•	Any links, mirrors, or archive captures of The Blah Witch
	•	Credits for the creator(s) or sketch group
	•	Screenshots, file names, or downloads from old computers
	•	Mentions in early film festival listings, message boards, or “funny video” compilations from ~1999–2002

Definitely not something that an ""offended"" person would do. Immediately started avoiding her after hearing about her behaviour behind my back. (Never breaking the rule of not asking out colleagues at work, no matter how ""jovial"" they might seem)

ayoko nang pahabain pa 'to so, I really need your insights kasi although tinanggap ko na, hindi ko naman maikakaila na bothered pa rin ako ng slight..",2,1760235746.0,adviceph,6,1.0,False

I'm 32, male, 180lb, 6'0"", Asian, average build. A professional engineer by day and a food dispenser for my cat by night.

Currently living on my own and enjoying my two big hobbies: anime and videogames. Current obsessions include Honkai: Star Rail, Hololive, FFXIV, Game Grumps and mountain biking. Other hobbies being sleeping, cooking, visiting coffee shops, sleeping, trying new foods, and making matcha lattes.

My only preference is please don't be overweight! Let's chat about our passions and hobbies or let me see how many times I can make you laugh. We don't have to like all the same things, tell me what you're into! Would love a genuine connection that could lead to long term dating.",2,1760235611.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I have a son with pretty significant autism, he still does not speak etc. 

I hadn’t thought about autism being a possibility until after I had a child. I’ve always needed more quiet time and find myself zoning out in social situations often. As a child I found it very difficult to regulate my emotions. I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder as a teen and social anxiety. I don’t have any close friends, and have always had a hard time keeping friendships and sticking to jobs. I’m currently 30 and unemployed to take care of my son, and I feel like the more I stay home the worse I become socially. I find myself panicking in the grocery store and coffee shop when it’s busy. My son is amazing and adorable but we both get overwhelmed at similar times and it can just be really tough to navigate. Sometimes I feel like the stress is taking such an extreme toll on my health. Any advice would be greatly appreciated ❤️. ",5,1760235531.0,AutismInWomen,5,0.86,False

Then online dating apps should be the only valid place to form relationships.,"No, it’s not the workplace, or a hobby. I don't care if you meet your husband at a gym or your husband cat-calling you was the way he won you. I don’t care how toxic dating apps are, or how “deep” and “authentic” meeting in real life is supposed to be. Dating is still the only environment where intentions are clear. There’s less room for plausible deniability, misinterpretation, or the usual “you’re creepy for trying” nonsense. For example, no muddying the waters advice to men telling them to attract women without trying to attract women. Or people saying it's creepy for men to join hobbies with the solo purpose of getting a girlfriend. Everyone involved knows why they’re there, sexually or romantically or otherwise, without hidden agendas.

Because outside of dating, men are constantly told mixed messages. If they approach women at work, they’re “unprofessional.” If they do it in public or the gym,  they’re “creepy.” If they join a hobby group, they’re “infiltrating spaces for women.” It’s the same shaming cycle,.

The entire online culture that tells men, “Don’t talk to women here, don’t ask there, don’t express interest.” But here’s the catch,  women rarely do invite. That’s not how attraction usually works. So men are being told to both initiate and never initiate at the same time.

The irony is, people claim they want organic connections. “Meet someone through your hobbies,” they say. But again the moment a man actually does that, the narrative flips, “Oh, so you joined just to hit on women?” As if any man interested in a woman must automatically be predatory. It’s a double standard that turns normal human attraction into a social crime.

That’s why dating, flawed as it is, remains the most honest environment left. You match, you talk, you decide. There’s no “is she into me??” or “is she being friendly ?” The parameters are upfront. You’re allowed to be attracted. You’re allowed to express it.

The problem with relying on “real-world” connection advice BS, is that it sets men up for failure. It tells them to read minds, to rely on “vibes,” to magically know when interest is mutual without ever asking. But when men do ask, they’re scolded for being direct. When they don’t, they’re called passive or cowardly.

Online daters may complain about ghosting, swiping fatigue, and shallow encounters. But at least there’s structure. Everyone knows the game. There’s no moral posturing about where or how you met. It’s two adults making an informed choice. That’s a lot more straightforward than the constant social landmines elsewhere.

So no,  it’s not the workplace, or the gym, or your friend’s art class. Dating is the only fair, transparent system left. If society keeps punishing men for showing interest anywhere else, then dating is the only place where both sides can actually admit what they’re there for, without fear, confusion, or accusation.

And again honestly, I don’t care how many people cry about how “soulless” dating apps are. Spare me the “real connections happen organically” nonsense. The same people saying that are the first to shame a guy for showing romantic interest in real life. You can’t have it both ways. You either accept dating apps, the one environment built for this, or you admit you just don’t want men approaching women at all.

Every other so-called “natural” setting is now a minefield. Work? HR nightmare. Gym? Creepy. Coffee shop? Harassment. Park? Weird. Hobbies? Manipulative. What’s left? Exactly, nothing. That’s why dating apps exist, because society keeps punishing men for trying anywhere else. If you don’t like dating apps, then stop demonizing men who make an effort offline. Until then, don’t complain.

I’m not going to sit here and pretend that men should learn to “read the room” better or “develop social intuition.” That’s just code for “guess what women are thinking without ever asking.” No thanks. I’ll take the app where both people swiped right, both people know what’s up, and nobody has to decode unspoken signals like it’s a hostage negotiation.

At the end of the day, I’ll pick clarity over chaos. I don’t care how romanticized “organic connections” sound when everyone’s just waiting to call someone creepy. Dating apps might not be perfect, but at least they’re honest. And that’s more than I can say for the fake, judgmental “advice” culture that tells men to just “let things happen naturally” while punishing them every time they try.
