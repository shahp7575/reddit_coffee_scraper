(4x2x2 or 5x2x2),"So I am looking at a Dubia enclosure and I already have an old coffee table thats an inch short of being 4x2 (ie 47x23). Can a Dubia with substrate safely sit on it with the corners all hanging off? Ideally I would get a 5x2x2 for maximum size, again the same question is 6 inches L and 1 inch W overhang an issue with their enclosure design? The rest would all be level on the coffee table.

1hzgcqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1hzgcqz/v60_or_hario_switch/,V60 or Hario Switch,"Hello everyone. After becoming accustomed to speciality coffee in the past couple of years, and learning the ins and outs of my aeropress I have finally decided to take the plunge into pour over.
I’ve got a Stagg EKG kettle on the way but have a bit of analysis paralysis on which dripper I want to purchase as my first. 

The standard V60 seems to be the classic, is easy to clean, and is the go to for most. The hario switch is a V60 still, but offers more functionality with the switch mechanism. I don’t foresee myself using the immersion function until I learn proper percolation which could take a long time. 

My question is, how many of you switch owners actually take advantage of its full capabilities vs just using it as a percolation dripper? Is it much of a fuss to keep clean vs a V60? Does the standard V60 deliver more as a better standalone percolation device?

I may just be over complicating things but want to see if the switch is really worth it over a standard V60.",1,1736662038.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

1hzga8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hzga8n/aitah_for_being_upset_with_my_boyfriend_after_he/,AITAH for being upset with my boyfriend after he ruined my relaxing bath and stressed me out before a party?,"I (Andrea, 24F) and my boyfriend Ralph (26M) have been together since 2018 and have lived together since 2020. Yesterday, I had the day off and planned to relax and enjoy myself, but the day spiraled into a mess because of Ralph.

The day started off relatively normal. We woke up around noon (it’s my day off, and I decided to sleep in). I got up, tidied the house, swept the floors, and made coffee while waiting for it to brew. Afterward, I made myself breakfast. Ralph decided he wasn’t going to eat because he planned on doing shrooms. He was in his own world while I was trying to go about my day.

After breakfast, we took our cat to the vet. The appointment was incredibly rough—our cat growled and hissed the entire time, clearly distressed. It was heartbreaking to see her like that. For anyone who’s a pet owner, you’ll understand how hard it is to watch your pet suffer, even if it’s something necessary like a vet visit.

When we got home, I was feeling stressed and emotionally drained from the experience. Ralph offered to run me a bath to help me relax, and I thought that was really sweet of him. I accepted, got into the bath, and started playing the Wicked movie soundtrack to unwind. (For context, I’m a huge fan of musicals. I did four years of musical theatre in high school, was one of the leads in my senior year, and have been to a few Broadway shows. Listening to Wicked makes me reminisce about my past passion for theatre and brings me so much joy.)

At first, everything was fine. I was enjoying my bath and my music. But just a few minutes in, Ralph came into the bathroom, saw what I was listening to, and started teasing me about it. It was lighthearted at first, so I played along and even sang to him a little. (I love singing—it’s a fun, carefree way for me to express myself.) But then, he noticed the Wicked movie poster on my iPad and shifted into full critique mode.

He started saying how predictable movies are nowadays and began analyzing the poster. Specifically, he pointed out how Ariana Grande (who is white) plays Glinda, “the good witch,” while Cynthia Erivo (a Black actress) plays Elphaba, “the wicked witch.” He went on a tangent about how movies often cast white actors in roles that are seen as “good” and Black actors in roles that are “evil” or less important.

Ralph asked me which of the two actors I thought was more of a focal point in the poster. I told him I thought both were equally important, but he kept insisting that Hollywood always prioritizes white actors over Black ones. I told him that he hadn’t even seen the movie yet, so he didn’t have enough context to make that judgment. But he wouldn’t stop. He went on and on about it for at least 30 minutes, turning what should have been a relaxing moment for me into a frustrating debate.

I told Ralph that I didn’t want to discuss it anymore because I was trying to relax, and I had a birthday party to get ready for in two hours. He left the room for a bit but came back shortly after, still talking about how I was “biased” because I loved Wicked so much. He said I was so invested in the musical that I couldn’t see the problems he was pointing out. I reminded him again that he hadn’t seen the movie, so he couldn’t fairly criticize it.

This back-and-forth went on for another 30 minutes. At one point, he even tried to change the music I was playing, but I stopped him because I really wanted to listen to Wicked. I told him he was ruining my relaxation time, but he just kept going.

By the time I got out of the bath, I was incredibly annoyed and upset. As I started getting ready for the party, Ralph came back and started analyzing my behavior. He told me I might have ADHD because I was “fixated” on the musical. He said he’d been reading ADHD articles recently (he has ADHD himself) and thought I was showing signs of being “defensive” and “biased.”

Then he brought up completely unrelated things, like how I used to vape. (I quit more than a year ago, but he said I might be going through an “addictive episode.”) He said he was “scared for me” and kept diagnosing me with things, which felt unfair and honestly condescending.

At this point, I was so overwhelmed that I started crying. Ralph then suggested that maybe I shouldn’t go to the party because I seemed “tired” and “stressed.” I told him that I was only stressed because he had been talking nonstop and turning a simple situation into something much bigger.

He then asked if I was tired of him or if I wanted to break up. Honestly, I am tired of him a
especially this very moment, but I didn’t respond—I just kept crying then sobbing loudly. Ralph kept pressuring me to “sit and talk” with him, but I pushed him off and told him I needed space. He said, “I’m doing this because I love you and care about you,” but to me, it felt controlling. I left the bathroom to calm down, then came back to finish getting ready. By this point, I was running late because I had to redo my makeup after crying.

Ralph continued trying to argue with me as I got dressed. I told him I felt like he didn’t want me to have a good time at the party and was trying to control me. He responded with, “Do whatever you want. I’m just saying this because I care about you.” I left for the party feeling drained, upset, and emotionally exhausted.

When I got home, I removed my makeup and went straight to bed. Ralph had fallen asleep on the couch (which happens often since he usually stays up later than me).

Today, we’ve barely spoken. Ralph left the house at 1 PM to go to work and hang out with his friends afterwards (which he told me about before leaving). He came home around 10:30 PM, went straight to bed, and we didn’t talk at all. I didn’t even look at him because I’m still so angry and hurt.

I’ve tried to include as much detail as possible. This whole thing happened in a mix of French and English, and honestly, it’s hard to remember every single thing Ralph said because it was a lot, and he kept cutting me off whenever I tried to speak. It all happened over the span of about two hours, and I was so overwhelmed by the end of it.

So, AITA for being upset with Ralph? I feel like I was clear about needing relaxation and space, but he kept pushing and making everything about him. Did I overreact?

I don’t know if you even remember me anymore, it’s been over twenty years but I still remember the moment I met you. It was the first day of kindergarten, my mom had just sat me in my seat at our shared table with the other kids and quickly made her exit with the rest of the parents. I had been excited to start school but once my mom left I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxiety and then I turned and saw you. You were sitting across from me, I can still picture your sparkling brown eyes and long, white blonde hair. At that moment, at that very second when your graze met mine, I fell in love with you. Instantly, we were best friends and you were also my only friend. I wasn’t interested in the other kids, I wanted to spend all my time with only you. You were always smiling, always laughing, you were radiant.  Even then, you had a presence brighter than the sun and I was happy to orbit. The other kids were drawn to you too, they played anything you wanted and listened whenever you spoke but you always chose me first.

We were two weird, giggly five-year-old girls who loved making up ghost stories and playing together with our My Little Ponys. Do you remember, while sharing a picture book, how we promised to live together in an adobe house when we grew up? Every school day, I looked forward to seeing you, we shared coffee cakes during lunch and played our made-up games during recess. Every week, we exchanged small, trinket gifts just to make each other smile. I still have one gift from you, the framed photo your mom took of us on Halloween. You were a vampire and I was a black cat. We stood together with our wide, gleeful smiles showing our missing baby teeth. Back then, I didn’t understand my feelings for you because I didn’t know girls could love other girls. Despite that, I remember how I dreamt of a long happy life spent together with you. Then in first grade, I realized I was different from other girls but I was sheltered so I didn’t have a word to express myself.

Unfortunately, after first grade, half of our class year was held back due to the number of students being more than our school could handle for one grade and we were separated. You went on to second grade and I had to repeat first grade. You made new friends easily but I didn’t, I spent that whole school year missing you. As an adult, I’ve tried to find you online but had no luck, maybe you’ve gotten married and changed your name. I hope you’re healthy and happy, thank you for those memories, thank you for being my best friend and my first love all those years ago. Maybe, if things had been different, I could have told you, back then, that I love you.

With Love,

Your Forgotten Friend",3,1736661747.0,lesbiangang,0,1.0,False

1hzg8gr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hzg8gr/the_silent_room_in_my_house_keeps_making_me_visit/,The silent room in my house keeps making me visit,"I’ve always been a man of routine. Every morning, I brew a pot of coffee, walk the creaky floors of my old farmhouse, and sit by the window overlooking the woods. The house has been too quiet since Alice passed. She was the love of my life, and now it’s just me here, rattling around in these empty rooms.

Lately, though, things haven’t felt right.

This morning, as I sat by the window with my coffee, something about the woods unsettled me. The trees looked different—too close, their gnarled branches reaching out like skeletal hands. And I saw movement out there, shadows slipping between the trunks. I told myself it was just wildlife, maybe deer or foxes. But the shapes were too tall. Too human.

I shook it off. I’ve been lonely, after all. Maybe my mind is playing tricks on me.


---

The noises started about a week ago. At night, when the house should have been still, I heard footsteps upstairs. They were soft but deliberate, pacing back and forth. I didn’t panic; the house is old, and old houses make noise.

But when I finally went upstairs to check, I found something I couldn’t explain.

The door to the guest room was open. I always keep it locked.

I stepped inside and froze. The room looked just as I remembered it—the bed neatly made, the rocking chair in the corner, Alice’s old books stacked on the nightstand. But something about the air felt wrong, heavy, like the room itself was holding its breath.

I backed out, shut the door, and locked it again.


---

The sounds didn’t stop. They only got worse. Footsteps turned into heavy thuds. The whispers started next—low and guttural, coming from the walls.

And then the objects began appearing.

I found Alice’s favorite scarf draped over the chair in the living room. A photograph of our wedding, its glass cracked, lying on the kitchen counter. I don’t remember moving these things, but who else could have?

I called my son, David, to tell him what was happening. He listened, but I could hear the patience in his voice, the way he was humoring me. “You’re just lonely, Dad,” he said. “Maybe it’s time to move closer to us.”

This is my home. I’m not leaving.


---

Last night, I woke up to the sound of the guest room door slamming shut. My heart thundered in my chest as I grabbed the flashlight from my bedside table and crept upstairs.

The door was wide open.

Inside, the rocking chair was moving on its own, its wood creaking under an invisible weight. Alice’s books were scattered across the floor, their pages torn and fluttering as if caught in a breeze.

And then I saw her.

Alice.

She stood in the corner, her back to me, utterly still. Her silver hair hung in stringy clumps.

“Alice?” I whispered, my voice shaking.

She turned slowly, and I wished she hadn’t. Her face was pale, her eyes black voids that seemed to pull me in. Her mouth moved, but the words were drowned out by a deafening roar that filled the room.

I stumbled back, dropping my flashlight. When I looked again, the room was empty.


---

I tried to stay away from the guest room after that, but it felt like the house wouldn’t let me. The noises, the whispers, the slamming doors—they all drew me back.

Tonight, I couldn’t resist. I stood in the doorway, staring into the room.

It was bare now. No bed, no rocking chair. The walls were scrawled with messages in a trembling hand:

“Where am I?”
“Help me.”
“Why did you forget?”

The words filled every inch of the walls, overlapping and chaotic.

In the center of the room was a mirror.

I stepped closer and looked into it.

I didn’t see myself.

I saw Alice.

She was screaming, her hands pressed against the glass. Her mouth formed the same word over and over:

“Remember.”


---

The memories hit me all at once.

Alice, frail and sick, lying in a hospital bed. Her voice, begging me to stay with her. The beeping machines. The moment she slipped away.

I remembered her funeral. The empty house. Sitting in the guest room night after night, unable to let her go.

And then I remembered forgetting.

I forgot Alice. I forgot the love of my life.


---

This morning, David came by. I don’t remember calling him, but he’s here now, walking through the house, calling my name.

He found me in the guest room, sitting in the corner. The walls are blank now, the mirror cracked and dusty.

“Dad,” he said softly, kneeling beside me. “What happened?”

“She’s still here,” I whispered. Tears streamed down my face. “I see her. She’s angry because I forgot her.”

David’s face twisted with grief. “Dad,” he said gently, “Mom’s been gone for years. You’re just... confused.”

But he doesn’t understand. She’s not gone. She’s in the walls, the floors, the very bones of this house.

David took my hand and helped me to my feet. “Come on, Dad. Let’s get you some help.”

As we left the house, I glanced back at the guest room. The door was open, and inside, the rocking chair moved ever so slightly, creaking in the silence.

The End.

1hzg865,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hzg865,Guy backed into me as I was passing through parking lot...totaled or nah?,"Recently purchased a 2016 Toyota Tundra Limited and I have been loving this thing. I've barely owned the truck for 2 weeks at this point. This afternoon I thought why not run up and grab coffee at the local Dunkin as I usually do. I hopped in my truck, and decided to place an order for pickup. As I'm about to hit accept, a random thought pops in my head. ""What if I get into an accident and can't pick this up? I should just order at the menu. Nah it's less than a mile up the road what am I thinking."" I quickly dismissed this thought, placed the order and off I went. As I turn into the parking lot, I start driving forward, passing the front of the store to wrap around the drive through. I make it just in front of the door, and am about to go over a speed bump. I'm doing like 2-3mph tops as I approach this speed bump. Just as I'm accelerating over it, BAM! My truck is still moving at this point and I look in my passenger side mirror and see a car smashed against my truck. He moves up a little and I pull off to the aide. I get out and see the damage on his car. I'm thinking, ""OK doesn't look too bad. My truck shouldn't look that bad then."" I almost had a heart attack when I walked around the side and saw the damage.

I imagine there is no structural damage (although I am impressed at how much damage this small crossover caused to my poor truck), and the air bags did not deploy, so I am hoping they won't total it. I used to do body work for a couple years out of high school, but I am not hip to the labor rates + parts cost these days. I imagine they will skin the bed side, skin the door (If possible), if not door will be replaced, cab corner will be an issue, and some of the internals of the door. What are the chances this gets totaled? Truck is extremely clean. 2016 one owner, 105k miles, and I am located in MD if that helps. I'm just so frustrated right now. Really ruined my weekend. I know it's just material, and can be fixed/replaced, but man I was really enjoying this truck. TIA!",3,1736661526.0,tundra,0,1.0,False

I’m alive and somewhat well. My plans were to post earlier today but something horrible happened. Reddit user autismo-the-mighty said that my house might be alive. I doubted this at first but now, after what happened today, I think he might be right. I’m still not one hundred percent sure but this morning I swear I heard more voices but the second I got out of bed unlike last time, they stopped.

I got up walked to the fridged grabbed one of those Jimme Dean breakfast sandwiches and popped it in the microwave. While it was heating up my house got warm. I had closed every blind and curtain in the house and the sudden change in temperature made me curious.

I walked over to the nearest window and lifted the blinds to reveal a desert. I could see the heat on the horizon. I went over to turn the A/C on only to find out that the thermostat wouldn’t work. I ignored it and walked over to the coffee maker to make some coffee when I went to get water the sink wouldn’t turn on.

Everything is going to shit.

Speaking of going to shit the toilet won’t flush. What am I even supposed to do now.

I thought about going outside but, I just can’t. To be honest I’m scared.

I really hope that my house is just alive and somehow taking me to all these weird places cause if it’s not. Fuck if its not than I don’t know what to do.

The thirst got to me after about five minuets and grabbed a water bottle. I only have about six 16 oz water bottles in my fridge and I’ve always heard not to ration water but I think I have to. Who knows maybe the water will magically turn on some day.

The electricity still works but the thermos stat is broken and the water seems to be shut off. Why? Well I have no idea.

It’s been quite a while since any voices or disturbances other than the water and thermos stat. think I might go to sleep and see what the house does next.

It’s been about an hour since I decided to take a nap and the house is dark. I grabbed my flashlight and headed to the closest window but the house hasn’t seemed to move. I’m still in the desert only It’s nighttime now.

I have no idea how this happened the time on the clock said 10:36 AM and I think I fell asleep around 9:00 AM and my nap felt very short. Maybe the clock was broken? Maybe I slept for like 9 hours? I don’t know but I was getting hungry anyways so I got up to turn on a light but it wouldn’t. “NO FUCK NO NO NO NO, GOD DAMMIT” I shouted. The power doesn’t work. I’m fucked. I have some emergency food supplies but those will only last a week or two and now I can’t make any of the frozen foods. I’m left with freeze dried fruit and milk mix for the next two weeks of my life. Likely the last two.

Its starting to get cold. I’m tired. I’m going to sleep and hopefully my house takes me somewhere warm. Or at least somewhere nice.

Welp my house moved. Now it seems like its in the worst place possible. It’s back in a forest only this time its snowing. Its brutally cold inside and It’s still dark.

It’s been about an hour now and a lot has happened. First off I’m going to have to charge my  from my laptop power bank but I’m not sure how long it will last me.

Going crazy cause I haven’t been outside for so long but I think I’m also starting to get used to it? Maybe it’s the change from functioning house to house that doesn’t fully work. I was just happy the voices stopped but that seemed to change almost right away.

I heard a woman speaking gibberish. Then an old man, followed by a child. I started to hear tapping on the window. Then scraping at the front door then the door nob went crazy. Someone was shaking the door knob even though it was unlocked.

Almost Immediately after I realized the door was unlocked I snuck over to lock it and after I did the shaking turned into violent banging the banging turned into screaming.

“LET ME IN, PLEASE!! I wont hurt you, JUST COME OUT! END THIS SUFFERING.”

It was the voice of a child. The screaming faded into sobbing. I peeked out the window to see what looked like a man curled into a ball on the porch. He had no clothes on and looked quite pale. I reached for my flashlight to get a better look but right as I shined it out the window he ran off into the woods.

I think I know where the voices are coming from.",1,1736661193.0,scarystoryemporium,0,1.0,False

1hzg3d3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Gloomy_Music_7907/comments/1hzg3d3/recalibrating/,Recalibrating,"Well. It’s done. Through every clenched jaw. Through every sigh. Through every body ache. Through every obstacle. Through every bad news, we did it. At any given point while one of us was trying to move the thing along, another one was dragging their heels and vice versa. This move did not bring out the best in us. 
Every single character flaw that I have struggled with in the past made itself known and my tools were put to the test. His were too. I think there were a few times one or both of us was ready to call it.
I was surprised it got so bad so quickly.
It means we have short fuses, short tolerance for chaos. It means one of us can be expected to fall off the rail for a bit and we have to trust that the other one will keep things moving while the other one tends to their derailments.
Tonight we said “holy shit, everything got real really quick”. 
He is excited to be affectionate and romantic with each other again; so am I. The lack of autonomy and space made it difficult to want to be affectionate with one another. We are looking forward to feeling close in that way with each other. It will take time.
My attitude has changed towards this situation. It’s hard for me to pinpoint how exactly; knowing that the next few months could bring deep tragedy I feel that we need to rebuild our bond, otherwise the tragedy could be far worse than it needs to be. We both have to be spiritually, emotionally and mentally fit to navigate the next year. 
We talked about our hopes for this home, ourselves, work and our relationship. Separately and as individuals. It felt important to talk about both aspects. We very much so want to maintain our own autonomy. 
For me; I would like to build a manageable routine for this space. I fell out of routine when I moved into his space and I think this contributed to the various meltdowns I had over the last 9 months. Though I need to stress something, I think the meltdowns are just a part of who I am.
I think that I need to allow them to just move through and stop fighting them so much. I believe they will lessen with time if I practice this.  I think my emotions are valid though I struggle with communicating them through difficult times and eventually I just meltdown.
I thought having a normal life would remedy this but I think it’s a part of myself now and less to do with my environment- as of late.
I have fallen out of all aspects of self care and as a result I have unintentionally become very cruel to myself. My partner has repeatedly asked me to stop berating myself and I have become worse than ever. This is because I have fallen out of my self care routine. I prioritize my partner over myself and that is an old behavior. Sometimes it just happens though. There is a life time of conditioning in this regard. I don’t choose to neglect myself; it’s a slow roll to absolute self abandonment. I stopped making art. I stopped eating healthy. I stopped singing. I stopped walking. I stopped calling my friends. I stopped keeping touch with my recovery community. And then I just found myself fat and crocheting while I bickered with a cat. It wasn’t a great place to be in and nobody really asked me to stop my routine- though our space did prohibit a lot of this stuff. It became too difficult to physically do because of one reason or another. 
Tomorrow morning, I finally get to start playing with my espresso machine!!!!!!! I am so excited and I had a GENIUS idea because there is something ELSE that I want to work on. Let me
Explain. 

As I was unpacking my things I became hyper aware of how much SHIT I have. Like useless stuff. Stuff that doesn’t even serve an aesthetic purpose in my daily life. It is memorabilia or something that I have kept because I was scared of the space it would leave in its absence. Don’t get me wrong… I really like brickabrack. I’m not talking about.
I noticed that the things I felt were CRITICAL for me to save were not actually that important for me to have saved. Now that I am on this side of things. I also noticed that some of the things that I no longer want are things I have not had for that long. I am getting about 6 months-3 years use out of things that I am buying NOW. So I am holding onto useless objects and I am continually purchasing items that are not holding long term value or use in my life. 

As I move forwards I believe it will be very important for me to be more intentional with my spending and consumption. I am ashamed of my waste. I am ashamed of my accumulation of useless belongings. I am ashamed of my mindless spending. I want to work on this. 
So as I was unpacking all of my useless things, I noticed that I have a lot of notebooks and none of them are quite filled. I found one in particular that is almost like a hardcover book and it is small. It is not big. I was thinking about what I could use this book for and then it occurred to me that I could use it as a JOURNAL for my ESPRESSO DRINK EXPERIMENTATION. Like I could scribble an arty little picture of the coffee drink, I could write out the recipe and then I could just write a little blurb about it.
And it would become my own little recipe book. 
There are a lot of things I can do with this. I could copy it and give it to our friends during the holidays. Or I could print it and turn it into a zine. Or something. 

Also, this has made me surf Pinterest for recipes and I noticed something else. I noticed that Pinterest searches only turn up potential things for me to buy on Amazon or some weird Chinese website like temu. Rarely do I find real life blogs or recipes or patterns that are from an actual person. All the shit I find in these Pinterest searches are SO RAD so of course I want to find out how to get them. And then boom, I’m right back on motherfucking Amazon. 
Enough. I live right across from a library. I am going to find my content to try from the library. 
And in the spirit of keeping myself in alignment with routines that bring joy into my life, I am going to try to keep my Saturday thrift store walk at least twice a month. I think that’s reasonable for my current lifestyle. This is where I hope to find the most content. I believe this will also distract me from political dread. I believe it will help me form a relationship with my community too. I believe this is in full alignment with my ongoing goals of self improvement and relationship matters. All of my goals support one another and I think that’s important; it helps make the whole thing run more smoothly. It creates harmony.

Okay. I am tired.
Tonight is the first sleep at the new house. Blueberry and jojo are scared shitless. I feel so bad for them. I feel so bad for mister. He’s overdone it and I am worried about him a great deal. I really wish he would listen to me and stop pushing himself. I used to feel that he was just being lazy or purposefully avoidant but I suspect my optimism was blinding me to the seriousness of his condition. Now that I understand, I can change my expectations. I can recalibrate.

* Cheap taxis (Didi)
* So many food choices
* Haidilao hot pot
* Night views
* Xintiandi
* Yuyuan Old Street
* RT-Mart
* Suzhou Pingjiang River

### Worst parts/places:
* Frequent ID checks and bag inspections at every station
* Almost no English speakers (even at hotel reception desks)
* Apps constantly require personal information

### Interesting facts:
* QR codes (WeChat or Alipay) are used for almost everything, and cash is sometimes not accepted.
* Loads of electric scooters on the roads.
* CCTV cameras are everywhere.
* Prices are generally reasonable, but coffee is surprisingly expensive.
* People were more polite than I expected and seemed indifferent to whether you were a tourist or a local. However, I barely saw any foreign tourists.


### Tips:
They mostly use their own apps, which are usually in Chinese. Since not many people travel to China, it can be hard to find information in advance. Here are some recommended apps:
* **Payment and transportation:** Alipay > WeChat
* **Maps:** Amap > Baidu
* **QR scanning for information:** WeChat
* **Taxis:** Alipay (mini-app) > Didi
* **Booking:** Trip.com
* **Restaurants:** Dianping ⭐️

1hzfz7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1hzfz7u/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_boyfriend_after_he/,AITA for being upset with my boyfriend after he ruined my relaxing bath and stressed me out before my party? ,"I (Andrea, 24F) and my boyfriend Ralph (26M) have been together since 2018 and have lived together since 2020. Yesterday, I had the day off and planned to relax and enjoy myself, but the day spiraled into a mess because of Ralph.

The day started off relatively normal. We woke up around noon (it’s my day off). I got up, tidied the house, swept the floors, and made coffee while waiting for it to brew. Afterward, I made myself breakfast. Ralph decided he wasn’t going to eat because he planned on doing shrooms.

After breakfast, we took our cat to the vet. The appointment was incredibly rough—our cat growled and hissed the entire time, clearly distressed. It was heartbreaking to see her like that. For anyone who’s a pet owner, you’ll understand how hard it is to watch your pet suffer, even if it’s something necessary like a vet visit.

When we got home, I was feeling stressed and emotionally drained from the experience. Ralph offered to run me a bath to help me relax, and I thought that was really sweet of him. I accepted, got into the bath, and started playing the Wicked movie soundtrack to unwind. (For context, I’m a huge fan of musicals. I did four years of musical theatre in high school, was one of the leads in my senior year, and have been to a few Broadway shows. Listening to Wicked makes me reminisce about my past passion for theatre and brings me so much joy.)

At first, everything was fine. I was enjoying my bath and my music. But just a few minutes in, Ralph came into the bathroom, saw what I was listening to, and started teasing me about it. It was lighthearted at first, so I played along and even sang to him a little. (I love singing—it’s a fun, carefree way for me to express myself.) But then, he noticed the Wicked movie poster on my iPad and shifted into full critique mode.

He started saying how predictable movies are nowadays and began analyzing the poster. Specifically, he pointed out how Ariana Grande (who is white) plays Glinda, “the good witch,” while Cynthia Erivo (a Black actress) plays Elphaba, “the wicked witch.” He went on a tangent about how movies often cast white actors in roles that are seen as “good” and Black actors in roles that are “evil” or less important.

Ralph asked me which of the two actors I thought was more of a focal point in the poster. I told him I thought both were equally important, but he kept insisting that Hollywood always prioritizes white actors over Black ones. I told him that he hadn’t even seen the movie yet, so he didn’t have enough context to make that judgment. But he wouldn’t stop. He went on and on about it for at least 30 minutes, turning what should have been a relaxing moment for me into a frustrating debate.

I told Ralph that I didn’t want to discuss it anymore because I was trying to relax, and I had a birthday party to get ready for in two hours. He left the room for a bit but came back shortly after, still talking about how I was “biased” because I loved Wicked so much. He said I was so invested in the musical that I couldn’t see the problems he was pointing out. I reminded him again that he hadn’t seen the movie, so he couldn’t fairly criticize it.

This back-and-forth went on for another 30 minutes. At one point, he even tried to change the music I was playing, but I stopped him because I really wanted to listen to Wicked. I told him he was ruining my relaxation time, but he just kept going.

By the time I got out of the bath, I was incredibly annoyed and upset. As I started getting ready for the party, Ralph came back and started analyzing my behavior. He told me I might have ADHD because I was “fixated” on the musical. He said he’d been reading ADHD articles recently (he has ADHD himself) and thought I was showing signs of being “defensive” and “biased.”

Then he brought up completely unrelated things, like how I used to vape. (I quit more than a year ago, but he said I might be going through an “addictive episode.”) He said he was “scared for me” and kept diagnosing me with things, which felt unfair and honestly condescending.

At this point, I was so overwhelmed that I started crying. Ralph then suggested that maybe I shouldn’t go to the party because I seemed “tired” and “stressed.” I told him that I was only stressed because he had been talking nonstop and turning a simple situation into something much bigger.

He then asked if I was tired of him or if I wanted to break up. Honestly, I am tired of him a
especially this very moment, but I didn’t respond—I just kept crying then sobbing loudly. Ralph kept pressuring me to “sit and talk” with him, but I pushed him off and told him I needed space. He said, “I’m doing this because I love you and care about you,” but to me, it felt controlling. I left the bathroom to calm down, then came back to finish getting ready. By this point, I was running late because I had to redo my makeup after crying.

Ralph continued trying to argue with me as I got dressed. I told him I felt like he didn’t want me to have a good time at the party and was trying to control me. He responded with, “Do whatever you want. I’m just saying this because I care about you.” I left for the party feeling drained, upset, and emotionally exhausted.

When I got home, I removed my makeup and went straight to bed. Ralph had fallen asleep on the couch (which happens often since he usually stays up later than me).


I’ve tried to include as much detail as possible. This whole thing happened in a mix of French and English, and honestly, it’s hard to remember every single thing Ralph said because it was a lot, and he kept cutting me off whenever I tried to speak. It all happened over the span of about two hours, and I was so overwhelmed by the end of it.

So, AITA for being upset with Ralph? I feel like I was clear about needing relaxation and space, but he kept pushing and making everything about him. Did I overreact?

This is a real life situation it's not fake no matter how movie like or fake it may seem. 

The two main people in this will be 
1. Bestie 
2. Free world

I'm 28 years of age. I left a 10 year relationship at the end of 2023. I quickly began a relationship with my best friend aka bestie.

My bestie and I have been friends for about as long as my 10 year relationship. He was there with me through everything and as I was for him. In 2019 he was sent to prison. He was given life without. He committed a murder to a man that was actively abusing his grandmother and his aunt right infront of him, but because of the good ol boy system in the south the stand your ground law only works on those that know someone. We have discussed in great detail the chances of him getting out. They're slim but there is a possibility. I get to see, hug, hold, kiss him once a month at supervised visitations. 
For a year now this has worked for us. Gradually it is getting harder but I still love the man and I'm not quite sure I want to give up on his small chance of freedom. 

I am a barista at a famous coffee shop. Recently we've had a guy start coming in. He's been shy but I finally got him to open up to me. He's adorable and blushes anytime we talk. He's a sweet heart. I learned that he unfortunately did 5 years in prison. *don't judge me, I don't know what it is about bad boys* 

When I found out Freeworld had been locked up I quickly began to tell him about bestie. He knows I care dearly for him. 

Freeworld and I really do be connecting daily and I really enjoy it. You can see it in his face that he does to. All my coworkers see him blush around me and light up when he sees me.

The other day I finally got the courage up and wrote my number on freeworlds cup I gave it to him and said ""here's your drink, and there's that (showed him the number) too if you want it. He asked who it was and I said mine. I wait and wait and wait... no text. 

Was I imagining all the flirting freeworld was doing? All my coworkers seen it and told me. 

Was I in the wrong for throwing myself out there? 

What am I doing with myself?

1hzftl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hzftl3/several_questions_about_cortado_shots_somewhat/,Several Questions about Cortado shots (somewhat specific to Breville 34mm PF),"Hey all I have recently re-setup my inherited Breville Barista Express after giving it a try earlier last year and being unimpressed with my own ability and the built in grinder. 

I am now using a Kingrinder K6 and it's been much easier to dial my drink into a pretty drinkable cup. Which leads me to wanting to try making my favorite drink, the Cortado. 

Question 1: I am currently using a fairly dark roast coffee but for the life of my the maximum I can get in the PF using the Breville Single Wall (non pressurized) double shot basket is 17g. I use a funnel and WDT then remove the funnel and distribute and tamp. If I try to 
put 18g in with the funnel even after WDT it goes over the PF edge and I have no chance to distribute it without losing that gram anyway. Any suggestions or just stick with a smaller dose?

Which leads to question 2: most recipes for Cortado I see call for a 2oz ristretto of espresso to 2oz steamed milk. A normal 1:2 on a 17g dose is 34g which is about 1.2oz. A ristretto would be even less. So where did they come up with this ""pull a 2oz (60gram) ristretto shot"" on my machine the would be 2 doubles at the very least and more like 4. 
Question 2 part 2: what does one change or do differently to pull a ristretto shot? I can't increase my dose so I imagine I would grind finer and cut off closer to 1:1? How much finer should I go? Or for the first few tries not worry about changing my grind? Or even bothering with ristretto? 



Putting aside the weird math leads in a whole other direction for question 3: I had to waste and I don't want to steam a huge amount of milk to only use a fairly small amount of it. I bought a small 150 mL milk pitcher. Does anyone have advice on using a small pitcher like this? Today's attempt I overfilled it before steaming so I didn't get much good foam but I'm going to try again tomorrow.

This is a real life situation it's not fake no matter how movie like or fake it may seem. 

The two main people in this will be 
1. Bestie 
2. Free world

I'm 28 years of age. I left a 10 year relationship at the end of 2023. I quickly began a relationship with my best friend aka bestie.

My bestie and I have been friends for about as long as my 10 year relationship. He was there with me through everything and as I was for him. In 2019 he was sent to prison. He was given life without. He committed a murder to a man that was actively abusing his grandmother and his aunt right infront of him, but because of the good ol boy system in the south the stand your ground law only works on those that know someone. We have discussed in great detail the chances of him getting out. They're slim but there is a possibility. I get to see, hug, hold, kiss him once a month at supervised visitations. 
For a year now this has worked for us. Gradually it is getting harder but I still love the man and I'm not quite sure I want to give up on his small chance of freedom. 

I am a barista at a famous coffee shop. Recently we've had a guy start coming in. He's been shy but I finally got him to open up to me. He's adorable and blushes anytime we talk. He's a sweet heart. I learned that he unfortunately did 5 years in prison. *don't judge me, I don't know what it is about bad boys* 

When I found out Freeworld had been locked up I quickly began to tell him about bestie. He knows I care dearly for him. 

Freeworld and I really do be connecting daily and I really enjoy it. You can see it in his face that he does to. All my coworkers see him blush around me and light up when he sees me.

The other day I finally got the courage up and wrote my number on freeworlds cup I gave it to him and said ""here's your drink, and there's that (showed him the number) too if you want it. He asked who it was and I said mine. I wait and wait and wait... no text. 

Was I imagining all the flirting freeworld was doing? All my coworkers seen it and told me. 

Was I in the wrong for throwing myself out there? 

What am I doing with myself?

1hzfolz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSPI/comments/1hzfolz/i_feel_selfish_for_not_wanting_to_go_dairy_free/,I feel selfish for not wanting to go dairy free in my diet.  ,"I’m a STM to a 7 week old baby girl.  We have struggled immensely with her little digestive system.  Her biggest issue being silent reflux + gas pains that started around 3 weeks.  We’ve tried probiotics, chiropractic/ body work, consulted pediatrician (did this first) & got a reflux diagnosis which she is on medicine for.  She has a diagnosed lip tie and we are having that revised this coming week.  Basically the last resort is a dietary change.  I am mostly breastfeeding with a bottle of formula 1x a day (Enfamil Gentlease).  I eat dairy- mostly in small amounts like some creamer in my coffee and a slice of cheese on my sandwich.  But dairy is obviously hidden in lots of food especially processed food.  

If the lip tie release does not improve her gassiness, I’m going to have her stool tested for CMPA.  I could have already cut out dairy but I’m selfish and I love food and I’m making a good amount of milk. And honestly life is stressful.  I have a toddler and I just don’t want to stress about my diet.  But the nights are killing me.  She doesn’t sleep well, and I need some sleep at night. Her gas pains keep her up for hours. 

I’m on the fence about just stopping breastfeeding and going to formula but I want to make sure she actually has CMPA.  My other thought is to embrace the hard and do it for my baby.  Dairy is a known thing in the world of newborns and colic/ gas/ reflux, so I should just be mature and cut it out.  My baby clearly has issues and I should be a better mother and do what is best for her, even if it’s hard for me. ",0,1736659447.0,MSPI,2,0.5,False

1hzfnwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1hzfnwr/need_some_help_to_make_good_coffee/,Need some help to make good coffee,"So, this little journey started because my wife really likes Starbucks brown sugar shaken espresso (not gonna lie, I’ve partaken and liked it as well) and I like gadgets. That said, I would like to replicate that particular drink as best I can and then springboard from that to learn to make better coffee and see if I actually like non milky drinks as well.

So to start, I bought a XBloom to see if I could make a base good enough to recreate the SB drink. Whilst I really like the machine and it introduced me to my first lighter roast that I actually found interesting…I’m not sure it’s going to work for the goal of making milky drinks for the wife.  If I’m wrong, then I’m game to keep the XBloom and continue playing with it. 

So, with the above in mind regarding the XBloom, today I picked up a Delonghi Magnifica Evo to see what I can do with it. I do like the milk based drink I’ve had off it but then I’m not sure that I would ever be able to drink any non milk based drinks from it as they seem like they will be too strong for me.

Currently I just have a couple different coffees that were relatively inexpensive and I thought I’d tryout. Both are from Blackout Coffee…their Brewtal Awakening (dark roast) and Smooth Finish (light roast). Perhaps this isn’t a great coffee, or perhaps it’s not something suited for my goals or perhaps I’m just doing everything wrong when brewing it.

So any help, advice, etc is much appreciated in both giving me a fighting chance at recreating that SB drink but then also making better coffee that I might actually enjoy on its own without dairy or sugar. I’ve always associated coffee with a strong/bitter taste that required dairy/sugar. However, whatever XBloom shipped with their machine was drinkable without anything and was an interesting drink that tasted nothing like any coffee I’ve ever had. It seemed to almost be more akin to a tea to me. It definitely made me interested in learning more about coffee and what kinds I might enjoy.",1,1736659376.0,JamesHoffmann,0,0.67,False

I did not speak to Leo throughout the drive.
Every attempt he made to speak to me was shut down by my silence. When we arrived home, I went straight to the bedroom.

Our house had four bedrooms. We chose it so our children would have a room each to themselves, but that wouldn't be the case now. I wonder which of the rooms I will be asked to move into when Amanda moves in.

Linda's words remained on my mind, and just like hers, I knew my bed would be cold soon.
""Tamia, please,"" Leo said, following me to the bedroom.

""Please, Tamia,"" he pleaded, and I turned to look at him.

""Please, what? Everyone is talking about it, Leo. You humiliated me at the party. So what she is your fated. Did you have to leave my side, get into the balcony and make out with her? Do you know the meaning of self-control?"" I asked him, and he bowed his head.
""The feeling was overwhelming,"" he said, and I laughed.

""Better go to Whitewood and finish what you started, Leo. Do not wait for my approval because it will never come. I will never say it is okay so you can feel good. In fact, it isn't okay! It hurts! It feels like a betrayal, and I can never get over it. So don't waste your time hoping I will see the light because I won't. I am the loser in this. Not you, not her, not the fucking pack members, just me. Me and Kaira."" I said, walking into the bathroom to shower.

I stood under it while the water ran, and I was frozen. I did not know what to do. Where will I go to? Just like Linda and Avery, I was trapped. I could not go anywhere without an invite because I was his luna. I could not dream of finding love. No one would want to try with me. I was stuck.

I sat under the water and wept.
I was trying to prepare my mind for the dark days ahead, but I couldn't. My heart was too broken, and I was too afraid.

""We will have to try, Tamia,"" Kaira, my wolf, said, resigning herself to our fate.
""What if she is mean and evil and wants him and everything to herself?"" I asked my wolf.
""Then we will let her have it. We can't fight this. She is higher than us, and she is his fated. We do not stand a chance. We just have to hope that she is nice and considerate, or a cold bed would be the least of our problems, Tamia,"" my wolf said, and I wept. This was all too much.

One month passed, and I watched Leo fight the bond. He never went to get her from the Whitewood pack. Alpha Ramzey sent several envoys to no avail. I knew he was trying to prove something to me, and I appreciated him for it.

We made love a couple of times, but it was different. His heart and wolf weren't in it, making it feel like pity fuck. I had never felt so low in my life until now.
He spent long hours in the office and reduced his time working from home.
I knew he wasn't attracted to me as he used to be.

Alpha Ramzey had threatened war with us if he didn't take his daughter, and word had spread that he was soliciting help from others. Because of this, we were summoned to the council meeting.

The meeting was where Alphas in our region met and decided on issues. Every Alpha had equal rights in the council, and the judgement was binding. Every council consisted of all the alphas in a region. Every Alpha in the council represented their pack.

I was nervous about the verdict, but I dressed to go anyway.

While we sat in the car's back seat, Leo squeezed my hand gently.
""Don't be worried, Tamia. You will always be my Luna. I promise you,"" he said, and I nodded and smiled at him. I had somehow learned how to pretend I believed him. The truth was the only reason I was still with him was that I had nowhere to go.

A lot of issues were discussed at the council.
Alpha Sylvester Volkov of the Dark Wolf pack, and Lord of all werewolves was one issue that troubled people the most. He conquered an entire region and was heading for ours.

Some people argued that the Dark Alpha never attacked unless someone offended him. Still, most believed he was a bully, and we needed to prepare ourselves.

Being an Alpha from another region, I had never met him before, so I could not judge his character or decide whether the rumours about him were true or false. One certain thing was that the man was powerful, and he was feared.
After discussing how evil the Dark Alpha was and deciding what to do on the matter, Ramzey's issue with Leo was tabled.

""Why have you refused to do the honourable thing, Alpha Leo?"" Kyle asked him, and I knew he would see kicking me to the curb for a fated as honourable since that was what he did to Linda.

""Your chosen cannot leave you unless you reject her. It is wrong to have relations with you fated and then abandon her,"" he said sternly, and Leo shook his head.

""I did not go all the way with her, I swear,"" he argued, and Kyle shook his head.
""Not according to Amanda,"" he said, and Leo frowned.

Either he was lying, or she was lying; whatever the case may be, people would likely believe her because of her ripped dress.
""We do not want a war among ourselves, Leo, do the honourable thing,"" Alpha Gabriel said and looked at me.

""You should not hold him back from his fated, Luna Tamia. It is cruelty,"" The chauvinistic bastard said to me. What was my crime in all this?

""Do not blame me for this, Alpha,"" I warned the man, and he took offence.

""I am not the one under scrutiny. Do not get me involved."" I warned him, and he growled.
""It is because of you he hasn't taken Amanda in. We can't have two powerful Alphas go to war because you don't want to share. Fate has made it, so deal with it,"" the man said, and I did not bother to respond because there was no point arguing with the bastard.

""You are expected to take Miss Amanda Richford in by the end of the week. Or the council will be against you. You might be powerful. You might have more land and wealth than all of us, but together, we are stronger than you. Do not force our hands. You have hurt Alpha Ramzey and should make reparations by doing the right thing."" Kyle said, and the case was closed.

We did not stand a chance against the entire council, so I knew we would welcome a guest into our home soon.

I returned home with Leo fuming with anger.
""I will move my things out of the master's bedroom tomorrow morning,"" I told him, kicking myself out of the room before he did it.
""No,"" he said.

""We will remain together. Since Amanda is hellbent on coming here, she will sleep in the other room,"" he said and looked at me.
""I swear to you, Tamia, I did not sleep with her,"" he said, and I nodded at his empty words and went to the bedroom.

I tossed and turned most of the night because I knew my life would be different in the morning.

Morning came, and Amanda arrived.
People stared as they moved their things into our home. I pointed to the guest room, and they reluctantly moved her things there. It was as if they felt she should not be there.

After they had arranged everything in her room, the people she came with left. I avoided speaking to her and decided I would leave the house when she chose that moment to speak.

""I am sorry for the inconvenience this is causing you, Luna Tamia. Know that if the rejection was an option, we would have done it in a heartbeat, but a powerful Alpha like Leo would not want to be weak neither do I. I promise I will not try to replace you,"" she said, and I knew she knew it was only a matter of time.

""Thank you,"" I lied and stepped out of the house. I walked to the woods, shifted to my wolf form, and ran.

I remained in my wolf form all day, until nighttime. I returned home and noticed that Leo's car was parked in front of the house. It was times like this I wished we lived in the packhouse; they would never have privacy.

I entered the house and heard their voices coming from Amanda's room. They were arguing about something. From the discussion, it was clear she had lied against Leo that they had relations, but they only made out. At the end of it all, she won and now is currently living with us.

I went to the master bedroom to shower.
Two weeks passed, and Leo treated Amanda like a ghost in the house. I began to feel sorry for her. I could see his efforts to stay away. She had asked for rejection several times already. I knew she did not mean it; she was only doing it to get a reaction from him. I wondered how long he would hold out on her.

I woke up with a sharp pain in my chest. I felt disoriented, but the pain soon made me focus. Leo wasn't beside me, and I did not need to guess where he was. This pain was different; it was draining and excruciatingly painful, and soon it stopped abruptly. I did not understand what had happened but was grateful that it had stopped. I laid back down to sleep but couldn't. Tears of fear, betrayal and sadness streamed down my cheeks, and I knew that my life had been altered completely.

Sleep eventually came in the morning's early hours, making me wake by noon. I could not take my normal morning runs because the sun was up, so I opted to shower. I left the room and went to find something to eat in the kitchen, and there they were, laughing and talking. They were silent when I entered the kitchen, and I had to cover my hurt.

""Please ignore me,"" I said and headed for the coffee maker.
""Good morning, Luna Tamia,"" Amanda said too nicely, and I looked at her. She turned to face me so I could see Leo's mark on her neck. It explained why the pain stopped abruptly, as Linda had told me.

I began to laugh immediately. That was the response that came out of me. I laughed and nodded.
""Congratulations,"" I said, lifted my mug and left the kitchen.

""Tamia, Tamia!"" Leo called out, and I stopped walking and turned to face him.
""Please, Tamia. It doesn't change anything. You are still Luna,"" He said, and I laughed. There was no way I was going to let Leo use me.

""No, Leo. I am not the only Luna anymore,"" I told him, and he frowned at me, wondering what I meant.

There was no need for me to elaborate now. I will do so when the opportunity presents itself. I looked at his clothes, and it did not seem like he had anywhere to go, which meant they would be together all day. It was time to start planning my exit. Yes, he won't reject me, and now that he has claimed her, I won't feel pain when they are together again.

It was time to start searching for places I could move to. I might not be able to settle down again, and I might have to move to a different region and lie that my mate is dead, but I knew whatever I needed to do needed to be quick. Amanda didn't seem like a nice woman, and I did not want to find out.",1,1736659075.0,GoodNovelHub,0,1.0,False

That wasn't up for debate you are making me a coffee"" so I now sleepily walk up stairs and see she sat her fat ass on the couch instead of walking two more feet to make her own coffee (this was normal she rarely left that spot on the couch ) anyway I decided seeing this that I had what I thought was a brilliant plan to make her think I was too sleepy to make a coffee .... So I make the coffee knocking over a lot in the process... Really putting on a show that I am too sleepy (wasn't hard cuz I was ) anyway I then pretend to accidentally mistake the salt for the sugar and fill her cup with three spoonfulls of salt mix it in with milk give it to her and then quickly flee to a safe distance so I could sleep  .... I didn't get far before I heard her reaction and that made my day ... When confronted later about it because she waited for me to wake to make a new one I told her ""oh oops sorry I was exhausted and they are both white powder "" and every time after she pulled something like this I reminded her of the salty coffee and I might accidentally do it again ",7,1736658608.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,1.0,False
1hzfflo,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1hzfflo/night_sweats/,Night sweats,"First, I do plan on meeting with my doctor. I’m specifically looking for people with similar experiences and would like to know what your situation/diagnosis was so I can be more informed prior to an appointment I make

I’ve always sweat much more than normal, usually only during the day but within the last couple months I’ve been waking up multiple times every night drenched in sweat head to toe (body outline in my sheets)  

not sure if it matters I’m relatively skinny compared to my height. I have a normal diet don’t drink alcohol or coffee. On a good night I’ll wake up only three different times just to change clothes, I usually have trouble going back to sleep because of it. I’m prescribed hydroxyzine Ativan lexapro and depicote (for seizures)
I vape (nicotine), I did smoke weed daily but it’s been over a month since I smoked/vaped weed last. I used to only be able to sleep if I smoked, I still feel the need to smoke

I can never remember my dreams, and never been through any traumatic experiences I can recall so I don’t believe my dreams are responsible

I’m not sure if I’m missing any important information but I’m open to sharing more. Turning 20 about 6’ I often weigh between 130-150lbs. Male 

I would like to hear any possibilities of what could be causing this so I can be more informed prior to my appointment and able to mention anything that could help my doctor. Thank you

They can add charm to every corner of your home, whether through their intricate textures or minimalist designs. From large statement pieces to a [ceramic vase small](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/vases/ceramic-vases) enough to fit a cozy nook, these vases offer endless styling possibilities. Here are ten creative ways to use [ceramic vases](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/ceramic-beige-vase-l) to elevate your interiors and infuse every room with personality.

# 1. Create a Layered Entryway Display

Welcome guests with a thoughtfully styled entryway. Arrange a cluster of ceramic vases in varying sizes on a console table. Pair them with dried pampas grass or eucalyptus branches for a touch of earthy elegance.

**Pro Tip:** Add a ceramic vase small with intricate patterns to balance the arrangement and create depth.

# 2. Adorn Your Living Room Coffee Table

Transform your coffee table into a stylish focal point with ceramic vases. Choose vases in neutral tones or textures to complement the rest of your boho home decor. Group a trio of vases with different heights and fill them with fresh or faux flowers.

**Styling Tip:** Incorporate a ceramic vase small with a minimalist design for a clean and modern touch.

# 3. Enhance Your Boho Wall Decor

Elevate your walls by integrating ceramic vases into your [boho wall decor](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/decorations). Install floating shelves and arrange vases alongside woven wall hangings, macramé, and small framed art. This mix of textures adds dimension and personality to your space.

# 4. Style Your Dining Table Centerpiece

A striking centerpiece can transform your dining table. Arrange a row of ceramic vases in similar tones but varying shapes for an understated yet cohesive look. Fill them with wildflowers or branches for a relaxed, natural vibe.

**Creative Idea:** Add a ceramic vase small with vibrant colors to break up the monotony and draw attention.

# 5. Decorate Your Kitchen Countertop

Bring charm to your kitchen by using ceramic vases to hold utensils, herbs, or even faux plants. A rustic ceramic vase pairs beautifully with wooden and metallic kitchen tools, creating a harmonious mix of textures.

**Quick Tip:** A ceramic vase small can double as a handy holder for spoons or small kitchen accessories.

# 6. Create a Cozy Bedroom Nook

Incorporate ceramic vases into your bedroom decor by placing them on bedside tables, dressers, or window sills. Opt for soft, pastel-toned vases to complement the calming atmosphere of the room.

**Pro Tip:** A ceramic vase small with delicate dried flowers makes the perfect accent for your nightstand.

# 7. Elevate Your Bathroom Vanity

Add a touch of sophistication to your bathroom with ceramic vases. A small vase with a sleek design can hold fresh flowers or aromatic reeds, creating a spa-like ambiance. Pair it with candles and natural soap for a luxurious feel.

# 8. Brighten Your Home Office

A stylish workspace boosts productivity and creativity. Add a ceramic vase small filled with greenery or dried flowers to your desk for a refreshing touch. Use larger vases to hold rolls of paper or stationery.

**Styling Note:** Choose vases in earthy tones to maintain the boho aesthetic while keeping your space organized.

# 9. Add Charm to Your Outdoor Spaces

Use ceramic vases to enhance your balcony or patio decor. Arrange them with potted plants or succulents for a cohesive look. Weather-resistant ceramics are perfect for outdoor settings, offering durability and style.

# 10. Create a Statement in Open Shelving

Open shelving is a great way to showcase your collection of ceramic vases. Mix and match vases in different shapes, sizes, and finishes for visual interest. Pair them with books, candles, and other decor items to tie the look together.

**Pro Tip:** A ceramic vase small is ideal for filling smaller spaces on your shelves without overwhelming the design.

**Why Choose Ceramic Vases for Boho Home Decor?**

Ceramic vases are the perfect addition to any bohemian-inspired home. Their earthy textures and natural tones align seamlessly with boho home decor themes, while their versatility makes them suitable for every room. Whether it’s a ceramic vase small or a large statement piece, these vases can be styled in endless ways to reflect your personality.

Explore a variety of unique designs and incorporate them into your boho wall decor and more to create a cohesive and inviting space. With the right styling, ceramic vases can truly transform your home.

I'm going to talk about eating problems, health issues, and mental health issues in particular, so TW on all of the above.

I don't feel okey. I feel weak, and apathetic, and it's getting substantially worse every day that passes. I can't sleep properly. I haven't been able to sleep good for the last four months, minimum, and that makes me feel miserable. Dreaming has always been my way of coping with the world around me, my way to disconnect.
I don't drink, I don't smoke... I don't even drink tea or coffee. The only way I've ever disconnected has been by going to sleep. And I can't do it properly anymore.
I've realized I can't eat properly either. I don't have any appetite usually, and believe me, I love food. I love the feeling of a full stomach, the happiness it brings me.
But lately it's been hard to swallow food. It's tedious. I enjoy the first bites, and then it gets boring, and I feel full, so I gradually slow down.
I've always tried to eat slowly, because I have ulcerative colitis and since I was diagnosed my doctor recommended it. But I used to finish a full plate in 20 minutes, 40 minutes tops.
Now I sit at the kitchen table forcing the food down for an hour and a half, cause I know I gotta eat, but physically it's getting impossible.

It's not that I want to be skinny, or fit, or whatever. I don't have a weight goal in mind. I don't think it's anything psychological, but I'm not completely sure.

I truly don't know what's wrong with me. I have a blood analysis scheduled next week, and I'm hoping that will give me some answers, cause I'm watching myself wither away in the mirror, and I cannot fathom how my family is not doing something about it.

I'm not in any big, excruciating pain, I must add... Sometimes I get headaches, and I get dizzy more and more often, but it's not constant.

I don't really know how anyone could help. I just wanted to vent I guess, and I don't want to worry anyone around me anymore. They all have their own things to worry about anyways.

Thank you for reading all this. I hope you have a good day.",1,1736658127.0,venting,1,1.0,False
1hzfba1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1hzfba1/how_to_choose_the_right_height_for_hanging_lights/,How to Choose the Right Height for Hanging Lights in Your Home,"Lighting plays a crucial role in setting the tone and functionality of a space. Whether you're adding ambiance, making a design statement, or ensuring proper illumination, [hanging lights](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) can transform your interiors. But one key question often arises: *How high should you hang your lights?*

In this guide, we’ll explore how to determine the right height for hanging lights, including [unique pendant lamps](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) and [hanging ceiling lights](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights), in various rooms of your home.

# 1. Dining Room: Elevate Your Table’s Style

When hanging lights over a dining table, the goal is to create an intimate yet functional setting.

* **Ideal Height:** Hang your light fixture so the bottom is 28 to 34 inches above the dining table. This allows ample clearance while providing focused lighting for meals and conversations.
* **Styling Tip:** Consider unique pendant lamps with bold designs to make your dining table a focal point. If you have a rectangular table, multiple pendant lights in a linear arrangement can add symmetry.

# 2. Living Room: Balancing Drama and Functionality

In the living room, hanging lights such as chandeliers or pendant lamps can add drama and elegance. However, placement depends on the room’s layout.

* **Above a Coffee Table:** Hang the light 30 to 36 inches above the tabletop.
* **For Open Spaces:** Ensure at least 7 feet of clearance from the floor to avoid obstructing movement.
* **Design Choice:** Opt for unique pendant lamps with artistic designs to complement your decor while adding visual interest.

# 3. Kitchen: Practical Yet Stylish Illumination

Proper lighting in the kitchen is essential for both functionality and aesthetics. Hanging ceiling lights are commonly used over kitchen islands or countertops.

* **Ideal Height:** Position the lights 30 to 36 inches above the countertop for optimal task lighting.
* **Pro Tip:** Use multiple pendant lamps spaced evenly over an island for a cohesive look. Choose fixtures with diffused lighting to reduce glare while prepping or cooking.

# 4. Bedroom: Create a Cozy Ambiance

When it comes to [hanging lights for bedroom](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights), the goal is to strike a balance between style and relaxation. Hanging lights can replace traditional bedside lamps or act as accent lighting.

* **Bedside Pendant Lights:** Hang these 18 to 24 inches above the bedside table for easy access and an uncluttered look.
* **Ambient Lighting:** For fixtures hanging in the center of the room, maintain at least 7 feet of clearance from the floor.
* **Style Tip:** Opt for unique pendant lamps with warm tones or dimmable options to create a serene and inviting atmosphere.

# 5. Entryway: Make a Lasting First Impression

The entryway is your home's first impression, and the right lighting can set the tone for your decor.

* **Ideal Height:** In spaces with standard ceilings, maintain a clearance of 7 feet from the floor. For higher ceilings, suspend the light so it hangs at eye level or slightly above for an elegant look.
* **Styling Tip:** Choose a bold hanging ceiling light to act as a statement piece that welcomes guests.

# 6. Bathroom: Style Meets Function

In bathrooms, hanging lights can add sophistication and practicality.

* **Vanity Area:** Position pendant lights or small chandeliers at eye level or slightly higher to provide flattering lighting for grooming.
* **Center of the Room:** Ensure at least 7 feet of clearance from the floor to avoid interference in smaller spaces.

# General Tips for Hanging Lights

1. **Consider Ceiling Height:** For rooms with ceilings taller than 8 feet, add 3 inches of height for every additional foot. For example, with a 10-foot ceiling, hang your light 6 inches higher than the standard recommendations.
2. **Scale Matters:** Ensure your light fixture’s size is proportional to the space. Oversized fixtures can overwhelm smaller rooms, while undersized ones may feel out of place in larger areas.
3. **Layered Lighting:** Pair hanging lights with other fixtures like wall sconces or recessed lighting to create depth and balance.

**Why Choose Hanging Lights?**

Hanging lights, such as unique pendant lamps and hanging ceiling lights, are not just functional but also artistic. They add character and dimension to any room, allowing you to customize your home’s aesthetic. From sleek modern designs to rustic bohemian styles, the variety ensures you’ll find a fixture that suits your personality and space.

**Explore the Beauty of Hanging Lights**

Whether you're selecting hanging lights for the bedroom or a dramatic fixture for your dining area, the right height and style make all the difference. Proper placement enhances the visual appeal while ensuring functionality.

So, elevate your interiors with unique pendant lamps and expertly placed hanging ceiling lights that reflect your unique style and vision!",1,1736658097.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False
1hzfb0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1hzfb0g/how_to_decorate_a_small_balcony_big_ideas_for/,How to Decorate a Small Balcony: Big Ideas for Compact Outdoor Spaces,"Your small balcony has big potential. With thoughtful planning and creative design, even the tiniest outdoor space can become your personal oasis. Whether you want a cozy retreat for relaxing evenings or a stylish spot for morning coffee, the right [house decor](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration) can make all the difference. Here’s how to turn your small balcony into a functional and beautiful extension of your home.

# 1. Start with Multi-Functional Furniture

In a small balcony, every inch counts. Opt for furniture that serves multiple purposes, such as a bench with built-in storage or foldable tables and chairs. Compact seating, like stools or poufs, can be easily moved around or tucked away when not in use.

**Style Tip:** Incorporate natural materials like rattan chairs or a [rattan basket](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/baskets) for storage to add texture and a touch of bohemian charm, aligning with [modern home decor](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) trends.

# 2. Maximize Vertical Space

When horizontal space is limited, go vertical! Use wall-mounted planters, hanging shelves, or hooks to display plants, lanterns, or decor items. A small ladder shelf can hold potted plants, books, or a stylish rattan basket for extra storage.

**Design Inspiration:** Explore [Dubai home decor stores](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) for creative vertical storage solutions and chic accessories to elevate your balcony style.

# 3. Incorporate Greenery

Plants breathe life into any space, and a small balcony is no exception. Use potted plants, hanging planters, or a vertical garden to create a lush and inviting atmosphere. Opt for low-maintenance plants like succulents or herbs for a practical yet stylish touch.

**Pro Tip:** Mix plants with different heights and textures for a dynamic look. A rattan basket can double as a chic plant holder, blending functionality with aesthetics.

# 4. Add Cozy Textiles

Soft furnishings can transform a small balcony into a cozy retreat. Use weather-resistant cushions, throw pillows, and rugs to create a comfortable and inviting ambiance. Stick to light, neutral tones for a modern home decor vibe, or add pops of color for a playful look.

**Style Hack:** Layering rugs in different patterns or materials can add depth and warmth to your balcony design. Check out Dubai home decor stores for outdoor textiles that combine durability with style.

# 5. Light It Up

Lighting is key to setting the mood in any space, and your balcony is no exception. Use string lights, lanterns, or battery-operated candles to create a warm, inviting glow. Wall-mounted lights or sleek floor lamps are also great for a modern home decor aesthetic.

**Bright Idea:** Pair fairy lights with natural elements like bamboo or rattan baskets for a cozy and chic look.

# 6. Create a Functional Layout

Design your balcony with functionality in mind. Whether it’s a reading nook, a mini garden, or an alfresco dining spot, define your purpose and arrange your furniture accordingly. Use space-saving designs like corner seating or wall-mounted tables to optimize the layout.

**Design Tip:** Incorporate compact storage solutions like a rattan basket for keeping essentials organized without compromising on style.

# 7. Personalize Your Space

Your balcony should reflect your personality and complement your overall house decor. Add personal touches like artwork, wind chimes, or decorative trays. Use colors and materials that align with the rest of your home for a seamless indoor-outdoor connection.

**Shop Local:** Visit Dubai home decor stores to find unique pieces that bring character to your space while supporting local craftsmanship.

# 8. Think Seasonal and Practical

To enjoy your balcony year-round, consider practical elements like an umbrella for shade, weatherproof furniture, or a portable heater for cooler months. Seasonal decor like cushions in bright summer prints or cozy throws for winter can refresh your balcony’s look.

I am thinking of bills, my bank account, gas in my car, grocery prices - oh god what will we have for dinner? I need more healthy foods in the house. But what if the produce spoils because I decide I want a couple more days of junk food until I eat healthy FOR REAL this time? Will I ever eat healthy like I want to for a prolonged period? I need to work out more. I should start tomorrow. Oh but I should also prioritize sleep, I haven’t been getting enough. 

I need to get up and start this long list of to-dos. 
Why am I the only one who thinks of everything we need to do in this house? I need to switch the clothes to the dryer. I wish I had a wardrobe I actually felt good in. Tonight I’ll wear something I feel good in! Will I have the energy? Sweatpants are ok. I can look cute in those. But does that make me lazy? What have I even done with my life. I’ve lost all motivation to be my best. Is my family disappointed in me? Is my partner? I don’t deserve their love. I suck. What do they even see in me? Are they slipping away from me? 

Who even am I? I should read more books. Start a new hobby. Who am I kidding. I am a waste of everyone’s time. I am a burden. But I’m also really nice. Am I too nice? Do I need to be more selfish? Is that a selfish thought? Oh god maybe I’m actually selfish. No that’s my dad, he’s the selfish one. I want to be the opposite of him. But I also empathize for how he was raised. It’s not his fault. I feel sorry for him. Maybe I should call him. No, that would be weird. We don’t talk much. But I wish we did. I need someone to talk to.

The first time I did, I met a guy there (~30). We ended up sitting at the same table and we both were new, we talked a bit in the group. 

Next time we met, at the end of December, he noticed me and came to sit at my table intentionally. Then we stayed behind for an hour to chat (first in a group, then just us). He mentioned some event he visited and I said it sounded interesting, so he offered to send me the link and asked for my number to do so. He walked me to my car and hugged me goodbye. When I said “see you! Hopefully” he replied “definitely”.

He texted me a couple of times since then, and currently we’ve been texting for three days straight. Just getting to know each other and giving some updates on our days. 

But I feel like he’s not flirting with me at all. He asks me questions, responds to everything I say, shares his thoughts/some small things unprompted, sends good morning and good night messages. But he’s not using any openings to flirt I provide. And he hasn’t asked me out. I tell myself it’s because our schedules don’t align right now (he’s been traveling since the beginning of the month, I’m leaving for my own trip until the end of the month soon), but there hasn’t even been a “we should grab coffee when we’re both back” from him.

1hzf8jv,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1hzf8jv/stop_caring_for_her/,Stop caring for her...,"# The Moment That Changed Everything

Let me take you back to a moment that completely changed the way I see relationships. There was this girl I was absolutely crazy about. I did everything you could think of—texted her every day, planned thoughtful surprises, and complimented her whenever I got the chance. At first, it seemed like she was into me too.

But over time, something shifted. Her replies got shorter, she started canceling plans, and I found myself constantly wondering, *What am I doing wrong?* I was putting in all this effort, yet she seemed to drift further away.

One night, after yet another ignored message, I had this moment of clarity. I thought, *Why am I doing this? Why am I working so hard to get someone’s attention when it’s not being reciprocated?* So I stopped. I stopped texting her first. Instead, I focused on myself—hitting the gym, spending time with friends, and doing things I genuinely enjoyed.

And guess what? A week later, she reached out, asking why I’d been so quiet. Suddenly, she was the one making plans, checking in, and chasing me. That’s when I realized something powerful: **When you stop trying so hard to make someone like you, you create space for them to value you.**

That’s what we’re diving into today—the mindset shift that flips the script and makes you magnetic.

# Point 1: Stop Trying So Hard to Impress

In every interaction, there’s this invisible scale of effort. The person who’s trying harder to impress essentially hands over their power. Think about a first date: if you’re overexplaining yourself, constantly trying to keep the conversation alive, or nervously filling every silence, you’re sending the message that their opinion of you matters more than your opinion of yourself. And let’s be honest—that’s a turnoff.

Now imagine flipping the script. Instead of trying to win their approval, you’re comfortable with silence. You hold eye contact and let *them* work to earn *your* attention. That’s when the dynamic changes. People value what they have to work for.

Tom Hardy once said, *""When you’re comfortable being yourself, it’s the most powerful thing in the world.""* The less you seek validation, the more others naturally give it to you. So ask yourself: Are you trying to impress, or are you letting them earn it?

# Point 2: Chasing Makes You Less Interesting

One of the most magnetic qualities you can have is **mystery**. But chasing someone relentlessly? That kills it instantly.

Think about historical figures like Cleopatra. She didn’t throw herself at anyone. She was intriguing, unpredictable, and always kept people guessing—that’s what made her irresistible.

If you’re always available, replying to texts within seconds, or bending over backward to accommodate someone, there’s no mystery left. And without mystery, there’s no excitement.

Here’s how to flip it: Don’t be so predictable. If you’re always the one initiating plans, step back. Focus on your own life and let them come to you. People are naturally drawn to what feels just out of reach. So ask yourself: Are you creating mystery, or are you giving everything away too soon?

# Point 3: Learn to Handle Awkward Moments

Ever noticed how the most memorable movie scenes are the ones with tension? That moment when two characters lock eyes, and you’re on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens? That’s tension—and it’s pure magic when it comes to attraction.

But most people are uncomfortable with tension. They rush to fill silences, crack a joke, or overexplain themselves. Big mistake.

Take a lesson from history: Alexander the Great was known for his calm, unshakeable demeanor, even in the face of overwhelming odds. That kind of composure is magnetic because it shows confidence and control.

In relationships, tension is about being okay with uncertainty. If there’s a silence in the conversation, don’t rush to fill it. Hold the moment. Lean into the discomfort. That’s when the connection deepens, and the attraction builds.

# Point 4: Quit Selling Yourself—Just Be You

Trying to sell yourself is exhausting and unnecessary. Imagine you’re on a date, and every word out of your mouth feels like a pitch: *I just got promoted! I love traveling! I have this amazing car!* Sure, it might sound impressive, but does it feel real? Probably not.

Here’s the thing: People can spot inauthenticity a mile away, and it’s a turnoff. Now flip it. Have you ever met someone who was so genuinely themselves—cracking jokes, sharing honest stories, and just vibing—that you couldn’t help but want to know more about them? That’s the energy you want to bring.

Confidence is quiet. It doesn’t need to shout. So next time, instead of listing accomplishments, share something quirky or unexpected about yourself. Let them see the unfiltered, real version of you. When you stop trying to impress and start being authentic, the dynamic changes. You go from trying to win them over to being someone they’re naturally drawn to.

# Point 5: Act Like You Don’t Need Them

Stop trying to win them over. Flip the script. Instead of hyping yourself up, disarm them with unexpected humility or humor.

For example, if someone asks you, *What’s your dream vacation?* Most people might scramble to come up with an impressive answer. But you could say something simple like, *Honestly, I’d be just as happy sitting on my balcony with a good book and some coffee.*

That response is unexpected. It’s not desperate or designed to impress. Instead, it shows that you’re comfortable in your own skin and don’t feel the need to play the *look how cool I am* game.

# Point 6: Women Are Always Watching

Women notice the little things you probably overlook. It’s not just about what you say to her—it’s about how you carry yourself in all situations.

* How do you handle frustration, like getting stuck in traffic? Do you lose your cool or take it in stride?
* How do you treat the people around you, from your closest friends to the barista at the coffee shop?

These small actions reveal a lot about your character. Women pick up on these subtle cues, often without you realizing it. They’re not just paying attention when you’re trying to impress them—they’re watching how you show up in the world when you think no one’s looking.

Before worrying about what she thinks of you, ask yourself: *Am I the kind of person I’d respect if I were watching from the outside?* If the answer is yes, you’re already setting yourself apart.

# Point 7: Start Acting Like You’re the Prize

Being the prize isn’t about having the flashiest car or the best job. It’s about how people feel when they’re around you. When you’re genuinely comfortable in your own skin, people can’t help but be drawn to you.

So stop trying to be someone else’s definition of impressive. Focus on being the best version of yourself, and let the right people come to you.

# Final Thoughts: The Less You Chase, the More You Attract

Focus on your own growth. Embrace tension, and learn to enjoy the process. Relationships aren’t about proving your worth—they’re about sharing your life with someone who values you for who you are. Once you adopt this mindset, everything changes—not just in your dating life, but in every aspect of how you connect with people.",0,1736657846.0,datingadvice,1,0.5,False

The marriage had been dead a long time, so I was very ready to move on. Decided I wanted a casual FWB thing, as I don't want to repeat the one night stands from my younger years lol. I found someone in a similar situation - 34/m recently divorced from his partner of 17 years - who was looking for the same thing as me. 

Within 2 weeks of talking, I spent the night at his house, and we had a blast. We watched 4 Marvel movies, had pizza, and had fun for half the night in bed lol.

We even have the same coffee order. This man literally feels like an extension of myself. I started staying over every Friday night, as we both are free from our kids then.

I've never been alone, and I really want to find who I am and become the person I want to be in life. I don't want a relationship. But I'm falling fast and I don't know how to slow down, or if I even want to. I love being loved, I love the good morning texts and the cuddles and being able to genuinely be me and have someone who actually likes me, as much of a mess as I am. Do I step back and take a breather? Do I tell him I'm feeling more then just friends? Do I just shut up and see where it goes?

1hzf3bg,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1hzf3bg/dior_homme_parfum_2025_review/,Dior Homme Parfum 2025 REVIEW,"Well well well... 

  
Dior comes out with a big swing and no ding once again in one of their main lines. Dior Homme Parfum is created by Francis Kurkdjian - or should I say Tik Tok trends. 

  
It opens up with a beautiful, powdery iris present in Dior Homme Intense, but that subsides rather quickly. The deep rich and rather sweet amber begins to take hold backed up by a large amount of patchouli, and some vetiver. However, don't let the notes fool you, the sweet amber is very much centre stage, creating a tonka bean note similar to Armani Code signature tonka bean. 

  
And that is what this fragrance mostly is. Armani Code in Dior packaging. I'd say its most similar to the Parfum, however the EDP is also present here. What I find interesting is that after about 3 hours, the vetiver begins to come forward more, and it give a smoky and woody vibe while in the air, while on skin it mostly smells like the sweet amber. 

  
As for the Iris, it is there, but you really need to search for it, overall however, it is barely present. 

  
On the Dior website, it says the Iris is reminiscent of chocolate or coffee - no. 

  
What about performance? It projects quite strongly for the first hour then settles into a moderately projecting scent. Longevity is a good 8 hours. Not bad. Not great. 

  
What do I think? I think that this fragrance is single handedly responsible for global warming, every conflict ever, and every time you stubbed your toe. 

I am of course joking. 

  
I think this is not a Dior Homme fragrance, but rather something that should have been put into a new line. It is very much chasing the trends of sweet amber fragrances, and the Iris which made the Dior Homme line great seems to be replaced for that. ",0,1736657328.0,fragrance,1,0.5,False

“Now then, it was a nice summer night when I was 18. I had just gotten done visiting my mom in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. She had asked for my help the week before, and I had promised to come. Somewhat begrudgingly, I went on Friday afternoon when I got off work, planning to stay over the weekend.

I got there at 2 o’clock in the morning, flopped into one of my mom’s guest beds, and fell asleep almost immediately.”

“Come on, Grandpa. None of this has anything to do with a drive.”

“Hold on, goddammit, I’m getting there! Now, after falling asleep that night—or should I say that morning—I woke up later to the smell of bacon and freshly brewing coffee. I stayed in bed a moment, breathing it in. Same old Mom, I thought to myself.

I got up, took a shower, got dressed, and went downstairs to find her. I walked into the kitchen, grabbed a cup of coffee and a plate of food, and started catching up with her. She told me she was planning to move somewhere smaller since she didn’t need all that space anymore. Then she said she needed help moving some things.

My heart dropped. I knew she had planned this all along—voluntelling me to help her move. I finished breakfast fast, put on my socks and shoes, and got to it.

We spent the entire day moving things and then got up the next day to do it all over again. Around noon, I told her, ‘Ma, I’m gonna have to get going soon. I have work tomorrow, and I don’t want to be up until 2 again and have to wake up at 8. That’s too little sleep.’

She said, ‘Oh, come on, baby, don’t you worry. We just have a couple more things to move before you can go.’

Well, you know how moms are—a ‘couple’ of things turned into hours of work. By the time I finally left, it was 3 in the afternoon, and I had an eight-hour drive ahead of me.”

“Finally, the good part, right?”

“Yes, the good part’s coming. Now hush, boy! Like I was saying, I hit the road, and it was fine for the first few hours. As it started to get dark, I instinctively glanced at the clock. It read 6:15. Damn, I better hurry. I don’t want to be too tired at work tomorrow.

I sped up a little and kept going. Around 10:30, I saw a pair of taillights ahead of me. Finally, I thought. I hadn’t seen any other cars on the road for what felt like forever.

I started gaining on the car, but before I could get close enough to see it clearly, it sped up to match my pace. Weird. I pressed the accelerator harder—100, 120, 140 miles per hour—but no matter how fast I went, I couldn’t catch up. The taillights stayed perfectly out of reach, just beyond the beam of my headlights.

Then, when I slowed down, the car slowed down with me. That was the first thing that really spooked me. There were no brake lights—just those two red taillights hovering in the darkness.

I figured I was close to home. My right turn was coming up. But when I reached the spot, it wasn’t there. No turnoff, no road, nothing. I kept going, thinking maybe I’d missed it somehow. Two miles later, still no turn.

What the hell is going on?

I kept driving, but the further I went, the stranger things got. The fog thickened, swallowing my headlights, and the clock on my dash froze at 10:46. I drove for what felt like hours, but it never changed.

That’s when I started feeling the decline—like the road was dipping into a valley. But there weren’t supposed to be any valleys out this way. I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up-something wasn’t right.

Suddenly, something brushed the roof of my car. Maybe it was tree branches I thought, but when I looked around, there weren’t any trees—nothing but open air, I gripped the steering wheel hard-hard enough to make my knuckles turn white.

It happened again, and this time I heard the sound of metal scraping against metal,I ducked and felt the car shake as if something had been torn from it and I felt a strong breeze come from above. When I looked up to see what had happened my roof was torn clean off.

I slowed down fast, got out of my car to look around to see what had caused the damage.

That’s when I saw it—the creature. It was massive, bigger than a house, with wings like a bat’s and an antenna dangling two red lights at the end. Its face was like an anglerfish with big ugly razor sharp teeth poking out from behind his top lip , but it had two sets of eyes—one on its face, and the other on its stomach.

It swooped down, trying to bite me in half. I barely ducked out of the way feeling a surge of adrenaline as I jumped up and scrambled back into my car. I gunned it, driving as fast as I could no regard for safety, but the thing was relentless. It chased me down the highway, swiping at my car.

I thought I was done for, but just as suddenly as it appeared, the creature flew away, disappearing into the fog.

Not long after, the fog lifted, and red and blue lights appeared in my rearview mirror. I sighed with a wave of relief I’ve never been so happy to see a cop in my life.

He pulled me over and asked, ‘What in God’s name happened to the top of your car?’

‘A low-hanging branch,’ I told him. No way was I gonna tell him the truth.

He let me go with a ticket for speeding, and I finally made it home. But to this day, I still can’t explain what happened that night.”

1hzeyjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1hzeyjm/why_may_my_online_friend_not_actually_want_to_meet/,Why may my online friend not actually want to meet?,"I'm a mid 40s happily married woman and I live in a tiny, country town of less than 1500 people. We moved here 6 hears ago and you can imagine making interesting friends out here is difficult, especially when a huge portion of our town populace is very old, very young or huge drinkers. But also, towns like this seem to be very cliquey. And really, making friends in your 40s+ just seems hard anyway. Most of my friends from before were through work and they just stopped texting and calling me back. 

So, my husband and I both online game. I came across another woman in game about a year ago who is a few years younger than me (late 30s) and we really hit it off. We often (not always) game together and she even initiated swapping phone numbers so we could text and call from time to time. She's married and I've heard her husband call out from the background from time to time just being friendly same as my husband does. I've mentioned to her a few times we should meet up for coffee or something (we live 4 hours apart) and she always seems really enthusiastic about it (OMG YES! we so should! I would love too!)and she's even mentioned that we should all go camping together as both of us couples are into 4 wheel off-roading etc. We've even discussed that our husbands would likely get along too and they've actually joined us in chat a couple times and seemed to talk quite fine. But when I try to actually make a plan, she bounces. At one point, I just stopped contacting her because I thought she just wasn't keen to be friends but then she always seeks me out and tells me she's missed talking to me etc. Or she'll text me to ask if I'm up for a game, things like that. So, this past weekend we were going to be in her area visiting my in-laws and I mentioned it to her the day before and she excitedly said ""Definitely call me when you're in the area and we'll see if we can catch up!"" But when I called her.....she didn't pick up the phone. I called twice, left a message the second time and she never texted back or called back. I was bummed but, whatever. Then this morning she sent me a long-winded message that she had forgotten about this family get together she had to go to but we'd ""definitely"" make plans another time. Meeting isn't make it or break it for me but why wouldn't you want to meet a friend in person? I'm not even an outgoing person myself, I'm very introverted. But I just don't understand. My husband said maybe she has self esteem or social anxiety issues? Has any one been this friend and if so, why didn't you ever want to meet in real-life? I guess it makes me feel like I'm just a convenience and not someone she considers an actual friend. Or is this just how things are done now?",8,1736656848.0,CasualConversation,5,1.0,False

Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold.
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it.”

I woke up at 9 AM, I had actually remembered to skip my alarm for once. Wasn’t up to getting my day started at 7 AM. Had this weird nap the night before, I slept from 9-11 PM. I hate taking naps because I can’t normally to back to sleep. I couldn’t go back to sleep until 2 AM. 

I wanted to sleep in, but I couldn’t. Had to be with my dad since he’s been having a rough cold. He made it clear instantly that he didn’t want to get out of bed. I knew he was on some different kind of shit today once I spotted how he had magnets and coins on his head. Some pseudoscience type shit, he probably saw some random YouTube video on that and thought it would help. I might as well have slept in since that man only got up at around 12. 

While we were eating breakfast, saw this white cat walking into our yard, practically was camouflaged in the snow. I thought that it was pretty fucking cool that its tail looked like it was from a tabby cat. Genuinely thought my eyes were playing tricks when I saw it. I tried coaxing it towards me with some *pst pst* but that fucker booked it once I stepped towards him. Anti social ass cats. 

I had work at 4 PM. Made sure to shower and get my routine done because I always manage to end up running late. Today’s event was a holiday party. Yes, a fucking holiday party in JANUARY. We are way past Christmas, shit, new years on top of that. It was called a holiday party but what’s the point of calling it one when it’s clearly Christmas themed.

I think I’m going to have to buy some new clothes for work because my pants aren’t fitting me right. They used to fit me, but then I lost weight. Felt like I looked like a clown with them on, all I was missing was some suspenders, the paint, and a wig. I guess it doesn’t help that I have a strange build to me, most pants end up being too loose or long for me. I need to actually visit a tailor for that shit, been meaning to for a while now. 

Anyways, I got to work about ten minutes early. We were expecting 150 guests to show up, whole place was decorated properly, everything was ready. The party didn’t actually start until 7 PM. I was annoyed that there wasn’t shit to do, these meds have me feeling guilty for not being productive. I ended up having an energy drink because I had a feeling I was going to need it. Tasted like shit. Didn’t have any sugar in it. Probably not the best idea to drink while on stimulants.

I knew something was up when only about fifty people came in the first hour of the party.  Sucks too since the DJ they had was actually good, most of the time they aren’t. They did end up going through the buffet pretty fast. It was kinda embarrassing that they wanted a buffet though because they were more than capable to actually pay for actual dinners but they wanted to be cheap. Still some good money coming from the party, but not as much as it could’ve been. Shit, the company must’ve been wanting to save if they only had a holiday party once the holidays were actually over.

No one really came to this shit. We had two bars set up and an entirely different room decorated for the party, less than 20 people even popped up in there throughout the whole party. We had this entire tray full of sweets and snacks. It wasn’t even a tray, was practically a full table. Barely touched. My uncle had to start sending our coworkers home because this shit was a bust. We had over prepared in so many ways.

Well, it wasn’t really a busy for us since everything was already paid for. Don’t think the company is going to be too happy once they realized how much money they wasted on the food. Even though it was only about 50, they were drinking as if it was much more than that. I love hosted bars. Although, it is pretty questionable how the bartenders never really stop people at times even when they’re noticeably drunk. Kinda makes me wonder how many people ended up drunk driving. But we should be thinking positively, right. 

I was kinda happy that my uncle had sent my coworkers home because they don’t know how to work with us. You’d think it would be easy for someone to understand that a certain type of glass goes in a certain rack. Or that you shouldn’t throw away broken glass in a trash bag. Had to restrain myself once I saw this guy throwing trash into the bucket we use to empty the liquids from drinks. Why is it a crazy concept to expect others to work properly? I’d rather it just be my uncle brother and I at times because at least we will be doing shit right. Can actually depend on them to get shit done. 

My brother was actually going to be heading to Chicago once his shift was over. Dude still hasn’t bothered to fix his windshield wipers or the other shit needed and he’s doing road trips. He’s going to be fucked if it snows. Road trips at 3 AM after a long day at work. I don’t know how he can do that, no wonder I always see him drinking coffee. Man is doing the same shit my dad was doing, but just with a Starbucks frappe instead of a Red Bull. He ended up leaving at around 10:30 PM.

The party was already dying down by then. I just wanted to start taking everything down as soon as we can. I had to work the next morning to clean this shit up. I could tell that my uncle wanted to leave too since he already began to take down the buffet before the party was over. I’m happy that the bartenders or the DJ didn’t end up pulling some bullshit where they keep going after 11. The bartenders didn’t even give me a tip either. I took that shit personally. Bringing them glasses that I washed and polished myself once they were going to run out, helped them clean up the bar, and I helped them take the bar down. Had me fucked up since that tip jar was full. 

I was shocked that my legs weren’t in any pain. Usually I’d be feeling some soreness or fatigued, but there wasn’t anything like that. Probably cause of the energy drink. It was an orange popsicle flavor, yeah, that does sound nasty now that I think about it. 

The cooks had me fucked up since they wanted me to put the leftover food away. I know their asses told me that so they could get home earlier. But I also wanted to be nice since it had been difficult for them since the chef quit. Didn’t even hit me until then how much food went to waste cause of this party. There was still a ton of brisket and pork leftover, which would’ve been used for the sliders if people actually ate it. I probably would’ve made myself a plate if it wasn’t 11 PM. 

It was weird seeing the chefs office so empty. That man would have all his awards, newspaper clippings of himself, and his best reviews everywhere on the wall. Now it’s just a husk. Kinda how this place is about to be if we end up with a shitty chef. I’m kinda sad I didn’t get to say goodbye to him, I did genuinely like working and learning from him. Even though I wasn’t a cook, he did give some good advice when it came to this kind of work. Had some funny ass stories too. 

My uncle and I clocked out once we had put the food away. We talked about possibly contacting the chef to see if he could hook us up with work at his new job. My uncle ends up revealing to me how one of our coworkers worked at the stadium nearby. And how my brother was told that if he applied, they could put in a good word for him. My brother didn’t even say yes to that opportunity…. 

He’s actually annoying me when it comes to that shit, he could be working at casinos right now and make bank, but he wants to stay here since it’s what’s convenient for him. I’m also annoyed that he didn’t even bring this shit up to me! I’ll gladly work over there. And I’ll be happy to bust my ass since I’ll be getting paid pretty damn good. 

Shit, even if it’s a seasonal job, all I need to do is put my foot in the door to get some more work there. Working for the Vikings, I know I could earn some good money there. Could open up other opportunities for me if I manage to get in too, just need to meet the right person and I bet they could get me into other big jobs. This is exactly the kind of job that I’ve been looking for.

I'm an East Coast-based, city-dwelling introvert (25F, 5'1""). I'm a homebody who enjoys the simple pleasures and the freedom that comes with being childfree (non-negotiable)—doing what I want, when I want (even if that's nothing at all!): curling up with a good book, occasional gaming sessions, binge-watching shows, planning my next vacation spot, trying new recipes or perfecting old favorites, hanging out with my two cats, and taking quality naps. While I can be outgoing, I ultimately need my downtime to recharge. You won't find me camping, hiking, or running a marathon—I prefer my adventures in or near civilization with AC, tasty food, and a proper cup of coffee or tea.

So, that's a basic summary of me. I'm looking for someone (preferably between the ages of 25-35) who understands the value of engaging discussions, can share their passions, and brings their own interesting perspectives to the table.

1hzetuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1hzetuk/remembering_to_forget/,Remembering to Forget,"Dear D,



Six years.



Yes, six years, indeed. I can’t even decide if it’s something I can call “a long while”. Up to now, it’s still a haze recalling how it ended. All traces of how it happened, inexistent. All I remember, after some ordinary days and nights, it was a series of just waiting and waiting, and looking and waiting, then wondering how and why you can go so long being away. Something you have shunned from my mind. You never wanted me to worry.



They call it “denial”.



For months, with my heavy-weightless body, I roamed the earth with that single spark of hope that you’re just dealing with a huge project and somewhere without signal. And that he will come home as he always did.

You kept me in a home that leaving is never an option. We had this love that can move mountains and break oceans apart. We fixed each other from the bruises of the past. We were each other’s peace. You were my epilogue.



And then that day came.

You came home to say goodbye.

I had to relearn what the word means. It was a new for me. I scanned all our days and never a single goodbye was said…until that day.

You did not even say the very word. But the hundred and more painted our fate.

I repeatedly reread your words. Like a child, I was making baby steps in putting sense to it. You will never abandon us. No matter what. Right? I kept hearing myself asking that. But it was clear that I just lost you. Even long before you came back.

There were so many answers. But I only wanted yours. Yours was the one that mattered. And I got them. The pain was like an empty hole that numbed me and still haunts me to this day.

You met someone else.

And so, my book ended with a broken chapter.

We reacquainted somewhere between then and now. Said our sorry and some. But I don’t know what’s special about tonight that the floodgates of pain have opened with all the shrapnel inside me pushing deeper at each thought that I lost you forever. Lost the one I want.

I can never get over it.

Not when your very words keep me up at nights.

Not when the vision of us is my endgame.

Not if I still love you this much even if I’ll never have the same love back.



In my saddest of nights, I just find myself reading my favourite chapters. Those lazy afternoons in our little porch sharing coffee and tea. The quiet evenings under the stars. The daydreams we make. Those were my truths. Those were my little infinities I keep replaying in a loop. In that tiny corner of my mind are those faint memories. That’s where I found eternity with you.



I miss you. Madly.

It’s like a beautiful curse.

Painful, yet it keeps me alive.

I love you. And I will keep writing it ‘til my nerves are done.

I love you…even if it may no longer be enough.

I love you, deeper than it ever was.

I love you, until never.

","I am planning a first-time trip to Paris for my family of 4 in late March. I  have spent many hours poring over travel guides and websites and am having trouble making decisions. I don’t expect to “see it all” but I would regret missing an experience we would love because of poor planning.  So far, all I have is a basic shell of an itinerary, but I hope members of this group will take pity on me and offer some suggestions. My goal for this trip is to see the most famous sights (Eiffel Tower, Louvre, etc) while allowing some time to wander into shops, sip coffee, and take in the experience of being in France.

Our information: Family of 4 (my husband, tween and teen daughters, and me). We are staying in an apartment with a kitchen in Marais (3^(rd) arr) and plan to prepare some meals there. Things we like: museums, arts/literature, friendly cafes, bookstores, gardens, picnics.  We are not adventurous eaters. At all. Kids are excited about having croissants but that is the extent of their enthusiasm for French food.  

Here is what I have planned so far. I still need to add an Eiffel Tower visit and a boat ride on the Seine. Beyond that, I’m open to other museums/experiences that make sense geographically and fill in some gaps.  I would also love recommendations for family-friendly restaurants, cafes, bakeries, carry-out places. Thanks for sharing your collective experience with me.

Day 1: Arrive at CDG at 10:00 am. Taxi (?) to lodging, early check in arranged. Visit nearby grocery store for basic groceries.  Not sure how much time to allow for all of that or what to plan for the rest of the day. Also dinner?

Day 2: 11:00 am-4:00 pm: Guided Paris “see everything” walking tour. Starts at Anvers station and ends at Lacoste station. ??? after tour ends.

Day 3: Morning—train to Versailles on our own.

Day 4:  Louvre, Tuileries--plus ???

Day 5: ??  Notre Dame and Luxembourg Gardens?

Day 6:  All day guided trip to Loire Valley

Day 7:  ?? Opera Garnier, Fragonard Musee du Parfum tour and mini workshop

Day 8:  1:00 pm flight home from CDG.

Ever felt stuck trying to grow your email list or generate quality leads for your business? You’re not alone! That’s where **lead magnets** come in—and trust me, they’re a game-changer. Let me walk you through how they work and why they’re essential for anyone serious about digital marketing.

# What’s a Lead Magnet, and Why Should You Care?

Imagine you’re walking past a coffee shop, and they’re offering free samples of their newest brew. You stop, take a sip, love it, and end up buying a full cup. That’s what lead magnets do—but for your business.

A **lead magnet** is a valuable freebie you offer in exchange for contact info, usually an email address. It could be an eBook, a cheat sheet, a discount, or even access to a free tool. The magic is in delivering *value* upfront so people are happy to stay connected with you.

# How to Make a Lead Magnet Your Audience Will Love

Let’s be real—no one’s giving up their email address for something generic or boring. Your lead magnet has to stand out. Here are a few tips:

1. **Solve a Problem**: Pinpoint a pain point your audience faces and provide a solution. Think “quick wins” that leave them wanting more.
2. **Make It Easy to Digest**: Nobody has time for a 100-page novel. Think simple, actionable, and visually appealing.
3. **Offer Real Value**: Create something so good they’d be willing to pay for it. Even better if it ties into your main product or service.

# Examples of Lead Magnets That Work Like Magic

* **Quick Checklists**: People love step-by-step solutions.
* **Guides & eBooks**: Offer deep dives on topics they care about.
* **Free Tools or Templates**: Something they can use immediately.
* **Exclusive Discounts**: Great for eCommerce or services.

# How to Get Your Lead Magnet Out There

Creating an amazing lead magnet is just the first step. Getting people to see it is the real challenge. Here’s how:

1. **Create a Landing Page**: Keep it simple. Highlight the benefits, add a clear call-to-action, and you’re good to go.
2. **Promote on Social Media**: Use posts, stories, or ads to get the word out.
3. **Use Pop-Ups Wisely**: Exit-intent pop-ups can be super effective without being annoying.

# Track Your Results & Improve Over Time

Don’t just set it and forget it. Monitor sign-up rates, test different versions, and ask your audience for feedback. Sometimes a small tweak—like a different headline or design—can make all the difference.

# Want to Dive Deeper?

If you’re curious and want a full breakdown of how to build, promote, and optimize lead magnets, I’ve written a detailed guide on this topic. It covers everything you need to know to start generating leads like a pro.

Blog owners can receive advertisements that fit their criteria and put them on their site, and advertisers can find sites that fit their criteria and place their ads there.

Use Case: Say you run a blog that talks about healthy drinks; tea, smoothies, coffee, etc. You make money by letting Google Ads on your site, but you don’t have much control over what they’re showing your users. Is it something harmful like soda, something unrelated like a vacuum cleaner, or hot singles near you? Furthermore, you don’t have an exact idea of how much you’re going to get paid from these ads. 

To solve this, our startup, Ad Slots, intends to give you more control over what is displayed on your site, for how long, and how much you get paid. Through our platform, it would be possible to connect with an advertiser, for example someone who sells eco-friendly cups, and get their advertisement on your site while knowing exactly how you are getting paid.

The platform would handle everything; contracts, ad displays, payment, etc. Site owners would simply have to paste a one line embed on their site to get started, and advertisers just have to upload their advertisement to begin submitting offers.

We are both female and 21. We were childhood best friends. During our teens we were going through difficult mental health struggles. We would get into arguments over little things and blow them way out of proportion and have said mean things to eachother. Well when I was 17, in a fit of frustration I curated, I suddenly decided that I didn't want to be friends and that it was best I just was alone. So I blocked my best friend on everything. Never talking to her or seeing her.

4 years later, I've gotten psychological help and I've been healing and am in a much better place mentally. I found my best friend on Facebook and I messaged her a long apology highlighting that essentially I didn't treat her right and that I wouldn't blame her if she never responded to me. I got no response and I assumed she just didn't want me in her life like I thought. 

About a month ish later I was with my mom, running errands. I stayed in the car as she went into the store. She came back out and says ""my card isn't working so I need you to pay. And there's someone you need to see."" I went into the store, and sure enough, my former best friend is working the counter. We had a little bit of an emotional moment, feeling a lot of things after seeing eachother for the first time in 4 years. I told her about the message I sent her. She told me she didn't see it because she doesn't ever check Facebook. So I asked if I could have her number, and she said yes and gave it to me. 

We've briefly texted over the holidays and I sent her the original apology. I told her there's no pressure to continue to talk to me, and it's fine if she didn't want to build up a relationship with me again, but that I was more than open to if she wanted. She told me she has an interest of getting to know me again, but is in a very hurt and sensitive place in her life and is feeling hesitant and unsure.

I haven't messaged her since Christmas. BUT THEN I was going to the grocery store about a week ago and as I was leaving, she was standing by the exit. I said hi, felt awkward, and acted like I was in a hurry to go somewhere and have been feeling like shit about the interaction ever since.

My dad and my partner said I should ask if she wants to go to a coffee shop or somewhere chill to talk. And some others said I should reach out, but I am mortified. 

I know it'll probably be fine given I already accepted her in her decision if she didn't want to build a relationship or even respond to my messages at all. But reaching out and trying scares me even more than the initial rejection. Help???

Leah is my childhood friend and Casey was my gfs childhood friend before we all started hanging out as a group. For the record, Leah and Casey are dating. Out of 4 of us,Leah and my gf seemed the least close just beacuse they had no things in common and Leah pretty much met my gf because she was my gf and her gfs friend,while I met Casey through and ex a long time ago. You see,Casey and Leah are incredibly close and they rarely do things without eachother. So if I ever went out for coffee or something, I'd go with both of them. I went out with one of them only once,just beacuse the other one was out of town. Last month my gf mentioned Leah is over at her house. I had asked my gf how was Leah there without Casey since they're s package deal,and my gf said ""Oh Casey's sick"", which made sense ig. Later on I found out that Leah had spent the day packing up my new years gift from my gf with her,to which my gf said ""yeah I had nothing else to do with her since Casey wasn't there"". I just shrugged it of,but fast forward to today,my gf wanted to see me but I couldn't make it due to work, and she decided to invite LEAH over instead. I had no reason to get mad or jealous,but then I saw my gfs story where she tagged Leah with some kind of a new inside joke only they know about , which again wouldn't pmo if my gf didn't mention the fact she came over like 5 times. Then she told me ""Leah is coming over again the day after tomorrow(again,by herself)"". Well THAT pmo so bad. Now, I'm not saying that my gf might be cheating on me,but this situation is just making me mad uncomfortable and I kinda have a bad gut feeling. Also,my gf seemed off today and she had a hard time falling asleep tonight,so I asked her what's wrong,she said she doesn't want to talk about it and I said ""you don't have to,but please tell me if it's something regarding our relationship"" to which she replied ""it is,but I don't wanna talk about it,I just want to fall asleep""

We’ve been through a lot. I didn’t have any past experience with physical abuse. I didn’t know how to handle when she would escalate during our conflicts and I’ve seen her “flip her lid” for lack of a better term so many times through the years; essentially entering into an entirely emotional state and trying to provoke responses from me. She’s broken so many plates and mugs, and escalated to throwing objects at me, and at some point it escalated into physical contact. I initially tried walking away, but I found her throwing things at me while I’m leaving or coming after me. Eventually I defended myself to the extent to stop the attack, mostly by restraining her arms and legs. Once  I slapped her after she came after me when our son was between us. She says I choked her once, but I don’t remember that.

Last year my sister was murdered by her husband. This sister actually brought my wife and I  together through her daycare and had a strong bond with my step daughter. This happened 2-3 days after our baby shower. The last year and a half has been hell. The conflicts intensified. I went through major depressions. I’ve nobody left in my inner circle; my parents are dead and my sister was my last source of wisdom.

We’ve been in couples therapy for half a year, and I’ve been in individual therapy for 3-4 months. We’ve been in therapy before but the abuse never came out, until I brought it out in individual therapy and then that lead to it coming out in couples therapy. I regret we didn’t get more of a plan for safety ahead of time.

In November i overheard her derisively  mocking my special needs daughter when she was crying. It nearly broke my heart. It sounded so evil and malicious. I walked in the room and looked at her and she chargedly asked me if there was something I’d like to say. I didn’t have words.

In December it all came to head as a conflict built for 2 days. I walked in the door with donuts and had my son and my daughter in the kitchen eating. I had gotten back from taking my step daughter to dance and cleaning the dance studio to help pay her tuition. She walked in and flipped her lid from the on going conflict we hadn’t resolved yet. She threw her coffee all over me, and then threw the mug at the wall. Our children started wailing crying. I pushed her out of the room for fear of them. She screamed for divorce like she does often in these battles. Then she went upstairs. Something broke in me; I called her father, he didn’t answer. I called the national DV hotline. They didn’t answer. I called a local one, and they answered. They said I should call the cops. I called another family friend, the wife, she had called the cops on her husband the year previous and once they made it through the difficulty of that time, they haven’t had an incident since; they said I just don’t show for court and the charges get dropped, but the system works that way for those who get the warning sign and it’s the only way to get them to stop. Still I wavered but then I heard what I thought was slamming around upstairs and I finally called the cops. She went to jail for a few hours. A male inmate told her she looked tasty. Her parents are furious at me. Our couples therapist thinks I overreacted. My therapist recognizes what she did was not okay but that the consequences of me calling the cops is a very drawn out repair process. She’s entirely focused on this being my fault. And that I’m the abuser but she goes to jail. 

I think we both have a part in it. I’d like us to sign a Fair Fighting Contract that reaffirms for us both not to escalate to this place.

Life has been even harder for nearly a month now. I’m losing hope of a functioning relationship with my wife. Maybe we never had one. I’m trying to hard to work on myself; our conflicts are so messy. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m lost.
