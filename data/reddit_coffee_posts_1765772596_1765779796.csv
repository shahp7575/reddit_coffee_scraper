# Unboxing and accessories

So starting with the unboxing, it's nothing fancy and there really isn’t much of an unboxing experience routine. Inside the S12 Ultra box you just get the outer box, the IEMs perched inside, the puck case with all the goodies inside, some paperwork, silica gel and a bit of QC paper. It’s neat, it’s a nice package and it has all the things you need to get started, but not much more.​

You get a very good puck style carry case that you have to unscrew to open and screw back on, so there is no way this thing is going to open up by itself. It is really well thought out with a rubber lining inside, and you also get a good assortment of ear tips: balanced and vocal versions, with the balanced tips being the preferred choice here for comfort and overall tonality. There is also a modular termination system with 4.4 and 3.5 screw‑on plugs so you can easily switch between balanced and single‑ended.​

# Design, build and fit

This is a first-hand look at the gorgeous IEMs and this unit is the Mocha color version, with a very beautiful coffee‑like coloration that looks really attractive in person. The shell is pretty much the same as all of the S12 lineup with only mild changes such as a slightly bigger vent on the side, so in terms of design language it stays consistent with the series. Overall it is a very ergonomic shell that fits just fine and can be worn for long hours, with a very nice flush fit on both left and right sides.​

The cable is a very good cable, a little bit on the thin side, but visually appealing with a brown mixed with silver design and a coffee‑colored chin slider that works well and matches the aesthetics nicely. You also get a generic copper‑colored Y‑split that leads down to the modular screw‑type termination, making the whole package look cohesive and functional. In short, it’s nice, stylish, comfortable to wear and visually distinctive, especially in this coffee color which makes it obvious that you are using the S12 Ultra.​

# Specs and drivability

A quick look into the specs: the S12 Ultra has an impedance of 16 ohms and a sensitivity of 101 dB. These numbers make it a pretty easy IEM to drive, capable of running off pretty much anything including a simple 3.5 mm connection to a phone while still delivering a good output.​

With better sources, it scales. It has been tried with the ZH3, the iBasso DX320 and the bundled DT01 DAC, and in terms of output performance it is really good across all of them. The DT01 powers the IEMs well and keeps the technicalities intact, but when you feed it more powerful sources like the ZH3 the soundstage opens up a bit more and bass dynamics improve, even though the fine details remain fairly similar across sources.​

# Sound Impressions

The S12 Ultra is tuned similar to the S12 2024 Anniversary Edition, with both having good sub‑bass extension and similar vocal and air regions with only mild roll‑off differences toward the mids. However, in actual audio the S12 Ultra is very clearly different: it is a very tamed version of the treble compared to the 2024, trading some of that spicy sharpness and extra etched detail for comfort and long‑term listenability.

# Treble and technicalities

Compared to the S12 Pro and S12 2024 Anniversary, the S12 Ultra is that ultra refined edition of the treble series. The Anniversary Edition and especially the OG Pro can get quite sharp and spicy in the treble, bringing more perceived detail but also more fatigue, whereas the Ultra calms that down.​

The S12 Ultra is very clean and comfortable to listen to, presenting details in a way that you would like without becoming overly harsh. High‑frequency elements like claps and hats stay lively and present, but the sharpness and harshness are significantly reduced so you can listen for long hours without fatigue, even on tracks with a lot of high‑frequency content.​

# Bass performance

In terms of bass, the S12 Ultra is good, with very fast transients and very good bass dynamics, as expected from a planar. It gives a nice punch and has good detail, but it is not a deep, guttural sub‑bass monster that will fully satisfy hardcore bass heads looking for maximum rumble.​

The bass sits more than a purely tastefully done mild bass, but a bit below full bass‑head territory, giving a sense of rumble and punch that feels very enjoyable for most listeners. With more powerful sources like the DX320 and ZH3, the bass becomes punchier, more open and more dynamic, while with the DT01 DAC the bass quantity tones down a little though the technicalities and detail remain.​

# Mids and vocals

Vocals on the S12 Ultra are very clear and well detailed without being overly forward. Male vocals sit in their proper position, not pushed aggressively ahead, blending nicely with the rest of the mix while still sounding clean and easy to pick out.​

Female vocals, like Miley Cyrus in “Nothing Breaks Like a Heart”, sound a little step forward, clean and crisp, with small nuances like breathiness and the mild scratch in her voice being audible, adding to a more “original” and lifelike feeling. In tracks with both male and female vocals together, both are beautifully present at the same level, without one overshadowing the other.​

# Soundstage, imaging and separation

The S12 Ultra offers a nice, wide soundstage that feels spacious for a planar IEM. It can create a convincing surrounding, enveloping feel where you sense instruments around you rather than everything being locked in your head.​

Imaging and separation are strong points: you can clearly pick out where individual instruments are located, with left and right channel elements being well defined and easy to differentiate. The synergy between instruments is really good, with clear separation yet cohesive blending, making complex mixes sound organized instead of congested.​

With “Noots” by Sum 41, a classic rock‑style song with good vocals and a strong bass line, the S12 Ultra works really well. Drums come through very clean, crisp and satisfying, guitars have a nice textured crunch, and the overall soundstage feels nice and wide while male vocals sit naturally in the mix.

On “Nothing Breaks Like a Heart” by Mark Ronson and Miley Cyrus, a pop track with strong bass and vocal focus, the S12 Ultra delivers a very nice bass line with punch and rumble, a beautifully rendered snare drum that feels crisp yet organic, and highly detailed vocals capturing small breaths and vocal texture. Instrument positioning is clear, the soundstage feels wide and immersive, and when switching from stronger sources to the DT01 DAC, the main difference is reduced bass punch while midrange and treble clarity stay intact.​

“Nothing to Worry About” by Peter, Bjorn and John showcases how the S12 Ultra handles busy arrangements with multiple instruments and both male and female vocals. The IEMs keep all those instruments separated while still giving a sense of overall envelopment and a very nice soundstage, with vocals super crisp and clearly placed between left and right channels.​

[https://music.apple.com/.../nouveau-souffle/1608025504...](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fin%2Falbum%2Fnouveau-souffle%2F1608025504%3Fi%3D1608025917&h=AT24zwFg2hMct0RgQEcX3fnN9gdoR5ZIQQ9rw6xg2llmlwr1hBX1zve9fHfEBm-gQVbLFUbAz9bVy8ZfdDwgi1UA-qppxWzjJQZUYn64g40usi6gEGZux_EMFcECQzUrTpjUTq-j4g&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT3zLQkcClxnfv02COybjjZAr3kBIDbAyjiVUxUueURnJ788id3OaRnWhi_1zuIduRS2j-aapHwJTlT4QOvPo9jS1Rn3T4NERBh2TBaDssWoP8ORfFzgxfkEebak23_JNmCwcTQlx9UH_X01IpNH6w7VrHeTvDFfQyPER-8nMKkZHxg)

Finally, “Nouveau Souffle” by Naestro, a club‑style dance track with guitars, claps and lots of high‑frequency energy, highlights the comfort and refinement of the S12 Ultra’s treble. There is no harshness or sharpness to those high‑frequency elements, the presentation feels wide and stage‑like, and both instruments and male vocals sound natural, detailed and comfortable even for long listening sessions.

# Overall verdict and use case

In terms of design, there is nothing radically new compared to the rest of the S12 series, but it remains a very nice, ergonomic, comfortable design with a gorgeous Mocha finish and a solid, modular cable system. Comfort is excellent, making it easy to wear them for long hours with a very nice listening experience overall.​

Sonically, the S12 Ultra offers a clean, wide‑soundstage tuning with very nice bass performance and good, smooth treble performance. It is one of the best planar implementations seen so far here: fast transient speeds, clean technical performance, refined treble and enjoyable bass that together make it a planar you can listen to for very long sessions without fatigue.​

**You should go for the S12 Ultra** if you value detail but do not want it to become overly harsh, and if you want that detail packaged with a very good sense of bass rather than a thin or anaemic tuning. It also makes a great starter IEM package thanks to the included DT01 DAC, modular cable and usable tip selection, even if the tips are only “okay‑ish” compared to something like Dunu’s sets.​

**You might not want the S12 Ultra** if you are a true treble head coming from the S12 2024 and craving that extra spiciness and maximum perceived detail, because the Ultra will feel more toned down in treble by comparison. Likewise, if you want extremely thumpy, V‑shaped, bass‑head levels of low end, this will not fully scratch that itch, even though the bass is very good overall.​

Taking everything into account, this is a very nice package and the rating here is four and a half out of five, mainly held back from a full five only by the fairly simple packaging and just‑okay tips rather than anything to do with sound. Performance‑wise it is very much out there, strongly recommended for anyone who wants a better planar experience overall without the usual planar sharpness

**$DKNG**: **-1700**

Wager Amount: 1.7U to WIN 0.1U

League: Miami Dolphins vs Pittsburgh Steelers (7:15PM CST on ESPN/ABC)

**Recap**: Cards never led in this game and Texans came out blazing from start to finish. I appreciate Brissett and the Cards competing but I honestly didn't have much hope. There were a few underdog ML I was considering, it was my Vikings, Colts and of course the last POTD, the Cardinals and they got smoked. They put up points, but they loss like a 5-1 underdog, worth a gamble. I definitely would take a shot again, especially when it's just 0.4U wager. **We are still over +25U and I got units to waste!**

There were also other player props I was considering too like **Sam Darnold O 233 Passing Yds**✅(-115) **Justin Herbert U 30.5 Pass Attempts**✅(-110)**AJ Brown ATTD**✅(+145), but I honestly wanted to take a gamble! 

**Matchup:** If I handicap one side of the bet I gotta do the other side as well. This one is for my chalky bettors and this will prolly be the chalkiest wager I will ever handicap as a POTD and it's De'Von Achane 60+ Rushing + Receiving Yds!

No matter how chalky it is, nothing is guaranteed! There's a possibility that he may come short from hitting this line. He can have a off nite, the defense could have his number, he can get injured, the Fins might just bench him, Achane gets negative plays and loses all his yds, he can fall short by a single yard, there are so many scenarios where he can not get this. Wit all that being said, he has covered this line in his last 8 games and every game of this season but one start. That's really damn good and seems automatic wit this alt. line, but nothing is a for sure thing! We will have to bet on this to find out on MNF!

**The Play & Prediction :** 1.7U on De'Von Achane 60+ Rushing + Receiving Yds. Achane gets all his yds in the 1st half!

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond.

In terms of bass, the S12 Ultra is good, with very fast transients and very good bass dynamics, as expected from a planar. It gives a nice punch and has good detail, but it is not a deep, guttural sub‑bass monster that will fully satisfy hardcore bass heads looking for maximum rumble.​

The bass sits more than a purely tastefully done mild bass, but a bit below full bass‑head territory, giving a sense of rumble and punch that feels very enjoyable for most listeners. With more powerful sources like the DX320 and ZH3, the bass becomes punchier, more open and more dynamic, while with the DT01 DAC the bass quantity tones down a little though the technicalities and detail remain.​

# Mids and vocals

Vocals on the S12 Ultra are very clear and well detailed without being overly forward. Male vocals sit in their proper position, not pushed aggressively ahead, blending nicely with the rest of the mix while still sounding clean and easy to pick out.​

Female vocals, like Miley Cyrus in “Nothing Breaks Like a Heart”, sound a little step forward, clean and crisp, with small nuances like breathiness and the mild scratch in her voice being audible, adding to a more “original” and lifelike feeling. In tracks with both male and female vocals together, both are beautifully present at the same level, without one overshadowing the other.​

# Soundstage, imaging and separation

The S12 Ultra offers a nice, wide soundstage that feels spacious for a planar IEM. It can create a convincing surrounding, enveloping feel where you sense instruments around you rather than everything being locked in your head.​

Imaging and separation are strong points: you can clearly pick out where individual instruments are located, with left and right channel elements being well defined and easy to differentiate. The synergy between instruments is really good, with clear separation yet cohesive blending, making complex mixes sound organized instead of congested.​

With “Noots” by Sum 41, a classic rock‑style song with good vocals and a strong bass line, the S12 Ultra works really well. Drums come through very clean, crisp and satisfying, guitars have a nice textured crunch, and the overall soundstage feels nice and wide while male vocals sit naturally in the mix.

On “Nothing Breaks Like a Heart” by Mark Ronson and Miley Cyrus, a pop track with strong bass and vocal focus, the S12 Ultra delivers a very nice bass line with punch and rumble, a beautifully rendered snare drum that feels crisp yet organic, and highly detailed vocals capturing small breaths and vocal texture. Instrument positioning is clear, the soundstage feels wide and immersive, and when switching from stronger sources to the DT01 DAC, the main difference is reduced bass punch while midrange and treble clarity stay intact.​

“Nothing to Worry About” by Peter, Bjorn and John showcases how the S12 Ultra handles busy arrangements with multiple instruments and both male and female vocals. The IEMs keep all those instruments separated while still giving a sense of overall envelopment and a very nice soundstage, with vocals super crisp and clearly placed between left and right channels.​

[https://music.apple.com/.../nouveau-souffle/1608025504...](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmusic.apple.com%2Fin%2Falbum%2Fnouveau-souffle%2F1608025504%3Fi%3D1608025917&h=AT24zwFg2hMct0RgQEcX3fnN9gdoR5ZIQQ9rw6xg2llmlwr1hBX1zve9fHfEBm-gQVbLFUbAz9bVy8ZfdDwgi1UA-qppxWzjJQZUYn64g40usi6gEGZux_EMFcECQzUrTpjUTq-j4g&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT3zLQkcClxnfv02COybjjZAr3kBIDbAyjiVUxUueURnJ788id3OaRnWhi_1zuIduRS2j-aapHwJTlT4QOvPo9jS1Rn3T4NERBh2TBaDssWoP8ORfFzgxfkEebak23_JNmCwcTQlx9UH_X01IpNH6w7VrHeTvDFfQyPER-8nMKkZHxg)

Finally, “Nouveau Souffle” by Naestro, a club‑style dance track with guitars, claps and lots of high‑frequency energy, highlights the comfort and refinement of the S12 Ultra’s treble. There is no harshness or sharpness to those high‑frequency elements, the presentation feels wide and stage‑like, and both instruments and male vocals sound natural, detailed and comfortable even for long listening sessions.

# Overall verdict and use case

In terms of design, there is nothing radically new compared to the rest of the S12 series, but it remains a very nice, ergonomic, comfortable design with a gorgeous Mocha finish and a solid, modular cable system. Comfort is excellent, making it easy to wear them for long hours with a very nice listening experience overall.​

Sonically, the S12 Ultra offers a clean, wide‑soundstage tuning with very nice bass performance and good, smooth treble performance. It is one of the best planar implementations seen so far here: fast transient speeds, clean technical performance, refined treble and enjoyable bass that together make it a planar you can listen to for very long sessions without fatigue.​

**You should go for the S12 Ultra** if you value detail but do not want it to become overly harsh, and if you want that detail packaged with a very good sense of bass rather than a thin or anaemic tuning. It also makes a great starter IEM package thanks to the included DT01 DAC, modular cable and usable tip selection, even if the tips are only “okay‑ish” compared to something like Dunu’s sets.​

**You might not want the S12 Ultra** if you are a true treble head coming from the S12 2024 and craving that extra spiciness and maximum perceived detail, because the Ultra will feel more toned down in treble by comparison. Likewise, if you want extremely thumpy, V‑shaped, bass‑head levels of low end, this will not fully scratch that itch, even though the bass is very good overall.​

Taking everything into account, this is a very nice package and the rating here is four and a half out of five, mainly held back from a full five only by the fairly simple packaging and just‑okay tips rather than anything to do with sound. Performance‑wise it is very much out there, strongly recommended for anyone who wants a better planar experience overall without the usual planar sharpness

\- Very beautiful Mocha “coffee” shell color that looks gorgeous and distinctive  
\- Ergonomic metal shell with a flush fit that stays comfortable for long listening sessions  
\- Good modular cable with brown–silver design, secure coffee‑colored chin slider and swappable 4.4 / 3.5 terminations  
\- Solid puck‑style screw case with rubber lining that will not accidentally open  
\- Easy to drive  
\- Clean, refined treble that is much more comfortable than the sharper S12 2024 / Pro while still giving good detail  
\- Wide, enveloping soundstage  
\- Comes bundled with the DT01 DAC, which powers it well and keeps the technicalities intact

**Cons**: 

\- Unboxing is simple and “nothing fancy”  
\- Stock tips are “okay‑ish” rather than standout, especially compared to some competitors  
\- Bass does not reach full deep for basshead level  
\- Treble is more tamed than the S12 2024 / Pro, so hardcore treble heads wanting extra spice and sharpness may miss that  
\- With the DT01 DAC specifically, bass punch drops a bit compared to more powerful sources

We had the S12, we had the S12 Pro, we had all the different versions of that S12 Pro, we even had an S12 2024 Anniversary Edition, and now we have the S12 Ultra. Now the S12 Ultra is set to be the final revision of the S12 series, and this one is a planar magnetic IEM retailing at 169 dollars as of their website, positioned as a refined version of all the previous S12s put together.

# Disclaimer

The S12 Ultra was generously loaned to me by my good friend Sushii from Sushii-Fi. As always, all thoughts and opinions in this review are entirely my own.

The S12 Ultra is a planar IEM priced at around $169 and is available internationally on the official Letshuoer website.

# Unboxing and accessories

So starting with the unboxing, it's nothing fancy and there really isn’t much of an unboxing experience routine. Inside the S12 Ultra box you just get the outer box, the IEMs perched inside, the puck case with all the goodies inside, some paperwork, silica gel and a bit of QC paper. It’s neat, it’s a nice package and it has all the things you need to get started, but not much more.​

You get a very good puck style carry case that you have to unscrew to open and screw back on, so there is no way this thing is going to open up by itself. It is really well thought out with a rubber lining inside, and you also get a good assortment of ear tips: balanced and vocal versions, with the balanced tips being the preferred choice here for comfort and overall tonality. There is also a modular termination system with 4.4 and 3.5 screw‑on plugs so you can easily switch between balanced and single‑ended.​

# Design, build and fit

This is a first-hand look at the gorgeous IEMs and this unit is the Mocha color version, with a very beautiful coffee‑like coloration that looks really attractive in person. The shell is pretty much the same as all of the S12 lineup with only mild changes such as a slightly bigger vent on the side, so in terms of design language it stays consistent with the series. Overall it is a very ergonomic shell that fits just fine and can be worn for long hours, with a very nice flush fit on both left and right sides.​

The cable is a very good cable, a little bit on the thin side, but visually appealing with a brown mixed with silver design and a coffee‑colored chin slider that works well and matches the aesthetics nicely. You also get a generic copper‑colored Y‑split that leads down to the modular screw‑type termination, making the whole package look cohesive and functional. In short, it’s nice, stylish, comfortable to wear and visually distinctive, especially in this coffee color which makes it obvious that you are using the S12 Ultra.​

# Specs and drivability

A quick look into the specs: the S12 Ultra has an impedance of 16 ohms and a sensitivity of 101 dB. These numbers make it a pretty easy IEM to drive, capable of running off pretty much anything including a simple 3.5 mm connection to a phone while still delivering a good output.​

With better sources, it scales. It has been tried with the ZH3, the iBasso DX320 and the bundled DT01 DAC, and in terms of output performance it is really good across all of them. The DT01 powers the IEMs well and keeps the technicalities intact, but when you feed it more powerful sources like the ZH3 the soundstage opens up a bit more and bass dynamics improve, even though the fine details remain fairly similar across sources.​

# Sound Impressions

The S12 Ultra is tuned similar to the S12 2024 Anniversary Edition, with both having good sub‑bass extension and similar vocal and air regions with only mild roll‑off differences toward the mids. However, in actual audio the S12 Ultra is very clearly different: it is a very tamed version of the treble compared to the 2024, trading some of that spicy sharpness and extra etched detail for comfort and long‑term listenability.

# Treble and technicalities

Compared to the S12 Pro and S12 2024 Anniversary, the S12 Ultra is that ultra refined edition of the treble series. The Anniversary Edition and especially the OG Pro can get quite sharp and spicy in the treble, bringing more perceived detail but also more fatigue, whereas the Ultra calms that down.​

The S12 Ultra is very clean and comfortable to listen to, presenting details in a way that you would like without becoming overly harsh. High‑frequency elements like claps and hats stay lively and present, but the sharpness and harshness are significantly reduced so you can listen for long hours without fatigue, even on tracks with a lot of high‑frequency content.​

# Bass performance

In terms of bass, the S12 Ultra is good, with very fast transients and very good bass dynamics, as expected from a planar. It gives a nice punch and has good detail, but it is not a deep, guttural sub‑bass monster that will fully satisfy hardcore bass heads looking for maximum rumble.​

The bass sits more than a purely tastefully done mild bass, but a bit below full bass‑head territory, giving a sense of rumble and punch that feels very enjoyable for most listeners. With more powerful sources like the DX320 and ZH3, the bass becomes punchier, more open and more dynamic, while with the DT01 DAC the bass quantity tones down a little though the technicalities and detail remain.​

# Mids and vocals

Vocals on the S12 Ultra are very clear and well detailed without being overly forward. Male vocals sit in their proper position, not pushed aggressively ahead, blending nicely with the rest of the mix while still sounding clean and easy to pick out.​

Female vocals, like Miley Cyrus in “Nothing Breaks Like a Heart”, sound a little step forward, clean and crisp, with small nuances like breathiness and the mild scratch in her voice being audible, adding to a more “original” and lifelike feeling. In tracks with both male and female vocals together, both are beautifully present at the same level, without one overshadowing the other.​

# Soundstage, imaging and separation

The S12 Ultra offers a nice, wide soundstage that feels spacious for a planar IEM. It can create a convincing surrounding, enveloping feel where you sense instruments around you rather than everything being locked in your head.​

Imaging and separation are strong points: you can clearly pick out where individual instruments are located, with left and right channel elements being well defined and easy to differentiate. The synergy between instruments is really good, with clear separation yet cohesive blending, making complex mixes sound organized instead of congested.​

With “Noots” by Sum 41, a classic rock‑style song with good vocals and a strong bass line, the S12 Ultra works really well. Drums come through very clean, crisp and satisfying, guitars have a nice textured crunch, and the overall soundstage feels nice and wide while male vocals sit naturally in the mix.

On “Nothing Breaks Like a Heart” by Mark Ronson and Miley Cyrus, a pop track with strong bass and vocal focus, the S12 Ultra delivers a very nice bass line with punch and rumble, a beautifully rendered snare drum that feels crisp yet organic, and highly detailed vocals capturing small breaths and vocal texture. Instrument positioning is clear, the soundstage feels wide and immersive, and when switching from stronger sources to the DT01 DAC, the main difference is reduced bass punch while midrange and treble clarity stay intact.​

“Nothing to Worry About” by Peter, Bjorn and John showcases how the S12 Ultra handles busy arrangements with multiple instruments and both male and female vocals. The IEMs keep all those instruments separated while still giving a sense of overall envelopment and a very nice soundstage, with vocals super crisp and clearly placed between left and right channels.​

Finally, “Nouveau Souffle” by Naestro, a club‑style dance track with guitars, claps and lots of high‑frequency energy, highlights the comfort and refinement of the S12 Ultra’s treble. There is no harshness or sharpness to those high‑frequency elements, the presentation feels wide and stage‑like, and both instruments and male vocals sound natural, detailed and comfortable even for long listening sessions.

# Overall verdict and use case

In terms of design, there is nothing radically new compared to the rest of the S12 series, but it remains a very nice, ergonomic, comfortable design with a gorgeous Mocha finish and a solid, modular cable system. Comfort is excellent, making it easy to wear them for long hours with a very nice listening experience overall.​

Sonically, the S12 Ultra offers a clean, wide‑soundstage tuning with very nice bass performance and good, smooth treble performance. It is one of the best planar implementations seen so far here: fast transient speeds, clean technical performance, refined treble and enjoyable bass that together make it a planar you can listen to for very long sessions without fatigue.​

**You should go for the S12 Ultra** if you value detail but do not want it to become overly harsh, and if you want that detail packaged with a very good sense of bass rather than a thin or anaemic tuning. It also makes a great starter IEM package thanks to the included DT01 DAC, modular cable and usable tip selection, even if the tips are only “okay‑ish” compared to something like Dunu’s sets.​

**You might not want the S12 Ultra** if you are a true treble head coming from the S12 2024 and craving that extra spiciness and maximum perceived detail, because the Ultra will feel more toned down in treble by comparison. Likewise, if you want extremely thumpy, V‑shaped, bass‑head levels of low end, this will not fully scratch that itch, even though the bass is very good overall.​

Taking everything into account, this is a very nice package and the rating here is four and a half out of five, mainly held back from a full five only by the fairly simple packaging and just‑okay tips rather than anything to do with sound. Performance‑wise it is very much out there, strongly recommended for anyone who wants a better planar experience overall without the usual planar sharpness

I M20 posted a couple months ago about me and my GF F20 arguing. She said she was late to work, but it turns out she had gone to the lake with her girlfriend and her girlfriends boyfriend. However, something felt off and I told her how I felt and it turned out she was lying to me and had decided to skip work and go to the lake with her guy friend. While I hadn't met this guy friend, he was very new to my girlfriend and me as she began talking to him a couple month into our relationship. Anyway, this guyfriend became very close to my girlfriend and began driving her places and inviting her over to his house after she got off. He also admitted to having feelings for her a few times, but that he wanted her ""as a friend"". After this, I began questioning this guy. I only heard about him from what my GF told me about him, but everytime she'd hang out with him and she'd snapchat me, he wanted to speak to me and he'd ignore me completely, which further felt very odd. She was also very short when she would be on the phone with me around him.

Fast forward a month after that lake incident with this guy, he invited her to his house and she obliged and decided to go there with him late at night. She told me he was being very close and personal with him, but she kind of liked it. This disturbed me very much so. He then invited her to the club with him alone and apparently he kissed her a few times but my GF told me it ""wasn't actually him"" as he was drunk, but I felt otherwise. She said she'd cut contact with him though after that as she ""felt she was getting too close to him and wanted to step back"". Anyway, a few weeks after that and he invited her to a Christmas event, she accepted and went. I told her it made me feel uncomfortable and reminded her that she told me she wasn't going to hang out with him anymore and she asked me if I trust her. She ended up going, and it made me so uncomfortable. I was irritated, but it's like I've almost become numb to it like if I say something, everything will go down, so I just went with the flow. A few weeks passed and everything was going well between us. I managed to throw away my irritation and look to the positives, but everything that has happened has lingered with me. Last week, she posted a snap saying ""Thank you babe 😘 ❤️"", holding a coffee. I learned about this from a family member who's always friends with her on snap. She saw the post and asked me, ""Are you with your girlfriend? She posted this snap."" I went to snap to find the post and asked my GF about it. I asked her why she posted that if I didn't get her a coffee, and she told me it wasn't directed towards me. I asked her who it was directed towards and she asked me if I trust her and how it seems like I don't trust her. I told her I was simply curious who she directed that to. She told me it didn't matter but then told me she refers to her friends as ""babe"" often. I was like, ""You know what, that makes sense. Some women do refer to their friends as babe"". 

That night, we were talking it out and she told me she slept with another guy friend before we were official and asked if that mattered to me. I told her it didn't matter as we weren't actually exclusive yet. It didn't match up though. That night she referred to when she slept with the guy friend, she said his girlfriend was there with him in the same apartment. I asked her about that and she said they broke up when she was there with him and they did it after the break up. Having  been lied to before by her, I tried to believe her, but I feel so disturbed about this as the stories don't match up and she has shown to lie about this stuff before. If she was the other one in that situation, who's to say she's not cheating on me. She has told me that she cheated on her ex out of anger that he cheated on her, but she told me that she was stupid for that. I thought it was over after that, but today she sent me an sms message saying ""You can come over I will wait for you 😘😉"". This once again started the cycle again. I asked her if this was meant for me and she said it wasn't. I asked her who it was from and she started sending me messages about our sex life. I figured she was trying to change the subject. I asked her once again who it was meant for and she said it didn't matter. I told her it did matter and that if she has feelings for someone, just let me know so I can move on. I told her it was flirtatious and she denied that. She's now sending me messages telling me everything was a mistake with me and she shouldn't have been honest about anything.

I really don't know what to do. I feel like an insecure piece of shit for this,  but at the same time, my trust for her is definitely damaged and for me that's hard to gain back.",2,1765778849.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

My Friend Went Missing in 1976. I Headed Out To Find Him

My name is Lloyd. I wanted to get this story off my chest. It happened so many years ago and I felt like it was time to tell it while I’m still breathing. I live in a nursing home so I got nothing better to do anyway. In 1976 my friend Stan went missing. He had been a close friend of mine since school and I considered him to be one of the best men I had ever known in my life. He was kind, thoughtful, intelligent and had good taste in music. We used to spend hours listening to Black Sabbath after school smoking cigarettes. Those were good times. 

Then in 1970 Stan was unfortunately drafted. The Vietnam war was in full swing by that time and he was eligible. Every young man in our town feared the draft. I begged God at times to keep my name from being pulled. Stories had spread about the atrocities being committed over there and I wanted no part of it. I never would have thought it’d be someone like Stan who’d get sent over. We were both only nineteen at the time. I didn’t see him for a long time after that. When he did return he was missing his left arm and his spirit.

My father said it was something called shellshock that was afflicting him, but at the time I had little knowledge about it. Stan had withdrawn into himself. He drank like there was no tomorrow and fell into despair. I tried to help him but Stan would refuse anytime I tried. He pushed everyone away. He eventually left town for a while, but he returned in January 1976. This is when everything slowly began.

By this point I was working as a bartender at a place called The Peculiar Platypus (odd name I know.). I was twenty five by this point and life had been going well. I had a girlfriend named Michelle and I was thinking about proposing soon. I’d been working longer shifts to save up for a ring. Then one day in January on Saturday the 31st Stan entered the bar. 

It was near closing. Stan had been in town for two weeks. There had been some whispers here and there. With all his mental issues he seemed to be a bit of a town pariah and with his recent return people had been uneasy. I knew about it but I hadn’t really talked to him yet since he returned. It was all still a little awkward. But he approached me that day, sat at the bar and said in a friendly but almost hopeless voice “Hey, long time no see.”

I smiled politely but I was worried. “Hey Stan. Good to see you.”

“Can I grab a VB?”

“Sure” I said, pouring him one. He took the freshly poured beer and took a long swig. He looked thinner. His eyes were dark with exhaustion, like he was constantly fighting an unending battle in his head. 

“I …” Stan started. “I just wanted to say sorry. For everything. For how I was before I left. I’m sorry I was such an asshole.”

Stan started to cry but he forced his tears to go away before taking another big swig of the beer. I regretted pouring it for him. Alcohol was the last thing he needed, even if it was my job to pour it for him. 

“I don’t really know why I came back here. I could feel something. Something calling me. It’s like there's a string on my soul tugging me towards …”

He stopped, like he was pondering something of great importance. “

“Towards what?” I asked.

He shook his head and finished his beer. “Nothing. Sorry. I’m just acting like a damn fool. Goodbye Lloyd.”

Then he left. I was very worried. His words didn’t sound like they were for a friendly reunion. Those words sounded like a final goodbye. I called my cousin Paul, who was a cop. It was a small town and I asked if he could send someone to keep an eye out for Stan just to make sure he was safe. 

Paul said over the phone “Of course. It's not the first time we’ve worried about Stan like this. I’ll have Norman do a drive around town. Maybe he will spot him.”

I thanked Paul and went back to my shift. The next morning I was asleep in bed when Michelle woke me up. “Phones ringing for you.”

I got up and answered. “Lloyd? Hey, it's Paul again. Just wanted to follow up on Stan last night.”

“Yeah sure, go ahead.”

“Well, we never found any sign of him. He’s disappeared. He was apparently staying with his parents and they said they haven't seen him since last night.”

Things quickly progressed after that. After telling the police and Paul about Stan's behaviour the night before they began to rally up a search party. Only six people volunteered to assist the search.. A part of me has always been a little resentful at the lack of effort our town put into finding Stan. We were put into pairs. Stan's father and uncle were one pair. Grant Harlow (our old mathematics teacher) and Edward Foreman (the town's mechanic) were another pair. 

The last pair was myself and a man named Trevor Redwood. He was a nice man only a year or two younger than me. Some folk in town weren’t nice to him and I knew he had some sort of mental or intellectual disability, but he never bothered me. I knew he loved to paint and I had actually seen his work once in the town hall. He was really good at painting landscapes, usually taking inspiration from places in the area. He was always proud of his work and I felt like if the world was a nicer place he’d have been famous. 

Along with the volunteers there were roughly eight policemen who were forced into going along with the search. Nearly all of them looked bored and uninterested. Bunch of bastards. It was February 2nd when we began the search. 

The terrain around our region was rugged and harsh. Our town was in Western Australia, a place well known for its dangerous desert landscapes. The police claimed they didn’t have access to a helicopter due to budget constraints so we were going on foot. I drove out to a section labelled on a map which Paul had provided to me. All around us was the long expanse of orange desert. 

We packed plenty of gear for the trip. Water, ropes, radio, flares, first aid kits and flashlights. I also brought my father’s revolver and twelve rounds of ammunition. I didn’t expect to use it but various wildlife existed in these parts. Snakes, Dingos, Foxes and more lingered around the area so it was worth it to have something to scare them off with. Trevor had his hunting rifle which he strapped to his back.

I marked on the map where we left the car and headed into the desert to look around. I made sure to park near a particularly large rock so I knew how to get back. It was shaped like a finger pointing upwards. It was kinda unnerving to look at. 

The day went by without much fuss but I was certainly worried about Stan. At the time I was feeling guilty. I should have done more to stop him, and now he was possibly missing in the unbearable heat. Trevor seemed to be in positive spirits at least. He’d often check in and see how I was doing.

“Don’t worry, we will find Stan.” Trevor said with a smile “He’ll be right as rain.”

At around three pm we were starting to feel less optimistic. We hadn’t seen any tracks or evidence of Stan being in the area. We hadn’t heard much chatter over the radio either. I was losing hope. Maybe he had just run out of town? Maybe he was fine?

Then Trevor noticed the cave. He pointed it out saying “Maybe he went in there for shelter?”

“Maybe” I replied “Come on, lets have a look”

We began moving into the cave itself. I raised my flashlight and looked in. There was a pathway that led down into an unknowable darkness. It led so far down that my torch couldn’t cover the whole cave. Trevor stepped forward a little but I stopped him.

“Wait, the cave might not be safe. I’ll scout ahead with the flares. Try and brighten this place up.”

“Good idea.”

 I walked ahead into the dark, leaving flares behind me every now and then so the path would be lit up. Trevor waited patiently at the cave's entrance. Eventually I lost sight of him the further in I went. As I made my way inside I noticed the bones of small animals on the floor. They snapped underneath my feet, making me feel ill. Further along I noticed something. A piece of paper. I approached it and picked it up. The note was written by Stan.

It read “It’s over. The whispers brought me here. It told me it’d make the pain stop. Make the agony stop. The phantom pain in my arm and the agony of my memories would cease. I leave this here on the chance someone finds it. Leave me be. Let me rest. Stan Jones, 1976.”

I swore and rushed blindly into the dark. Something about this place was horribly wrong and my old friend had clearly had some kind of breakdown. I had to get him out of that place. I owed him that much. The pathway led further in and I noticed cobwebs covering the walls. I had to push through them hoping to god none of the webs were made by Redback spiders. If they were, I'd be dead before help could get to me. I pushed further in and found myself in a large chamber. That's when I saw it.

The web that covered the walls of this place was filled with skeletons, mummified and dried out in the heat. Bones of humans and animals covered the floor along with tattered pieces of clothing. The room smelt of death and hunger. It didn’t take long to see Stan stuck to the wall. I rushed over to him and tried to pull the webs off him. But he was dead. His eyes were closed but he was smiling. He looked content with his fate, his pain vanished. Anger, guilt and grief exploded in my heart. That feeling dulled over the decades, but I never truly healed from it. It was always there haunting me.

As I inspected him I saw something. There was a puncture mark on his arm where something large had bitten him, but the bite was too large for a normal sized spider. Whatever it was, it was huge. Black venom spiraled into Stan's dead veins. I knew then that there was something truly unnatural happening in this place. Then a glob of disgusting slime brushed my shoulder and I looked up.

I was somewhere else. I was at Stan's house listening to Black Sabbath's Paranoid album. He was due to be shipped out the next day, but at that moment it was just us listening to the music. I wanted to tell him to stay, to run away from the army. I wanted us to stay like we were in this moment. Just two friends sharing the music.

A loud BANG woke me up from my stupor. I stumbled backwards realising I had been in some sort of trance. I looked up and remembered. A gigantic beast stood above me clinging to the webs. It had hundreds of eyes, black hair and multiple legs. The spiderlike creature shrieked and I saw Trevor at the entrance of the chamber. He looked at me yelling “Lloyd, get up!” before he fired another shot. BANG. 

The second shot missed and the large spider pounced near me. The vision it entranced me with still lingered in my mind, making me feel groggy. I reached to my side and took out the revolver. I fired multiple times. BANG, BANG, BANG. I ruptured one of its eyes but the other shots missed completely. I couldn’t keep my hands steady. It screeched and I could almost hear it speak. “Hungry…” it muttered in a foul voice.

“Get up!” Trevor begged, firing one more shot. BANG. It hit the monster in the mouth forcing it backwards in pain. Then Trevor grabbed my shoulder and dragged me out of the chamber. He was my saviour and I was indebted to him for the rest of my life. We barely made it out of that place alive. Once we were out we used the radio to call everyone. When they came Paul thought we were tripping on acid.

We led the entire party into the caves but the monster was gone. All that remained were the webs, the bones and Stan. Paul never believed our story, thinking we were scared in the dark. He thought, with everything going on, that we had probably exaggerated the severity of the situation. I didn’t care. I just wanted to get Stan's body out of there and go home before that thing came back. The only ones who believed me were Stan’s father and uncle. They were both heartbroken.

I never found out how it contacted Stan. Judging from the fact that the monster could somehow infect peoples minds I imagined that it must've had some sort of powerful telepathy. It must've spoken to him, promising euphoria and an end to his pain. But in the end it consumed him. 

Years went by and I stayed in town waiting for signs of that creature, but none came. I hoped it died somewhere out there in the desert, boiling to death under the sun. My life afterwards was good. I had two sons with Michelle and ended up buying the bar I worked at. Paul continued working with the police. He passed away last year. Trevor did well for himself and we’d occasionally catch up for the odd coffee or two every now and then. He had a son named Ted who grew to be a respectable man. Sometimes he goes hunting and I pray that he never runs into any spiders.

And that's the story. It was so long ago now and I just wanted to tell it. Nobody is gonna believe it and I don’t really care. I’m old and I could drop dead one of these days so I figured someone might enjoy it. Word of advice, if your friends are struggling please check in with them. If you’re struggling, try talking to someone. And lastly, if you hear someone beckoning you into the desert offering you peace and elation, just ignore it. So long.

Hey 👋🏻 if you made it to the end of the story just wanted to say thanks. I’m a writer from Australia and this is my second story I’ve posted here. If you liked this one, maybe check out my other story (I worked as a pizza delivery driver in the late eighties. I wasn’t allowed in the freezer). Or don’t. I’m not the boss of you do whatever you want 👍🏻

I have more stories coming soon as well. Really been enjoying writing lately and I’m also working on a short story collection so there should be more stuff in the future. Thanks again 😊",1,1765778554.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I’ve already decided that I need to sleep on it before a reply, which I will send either way. But I’ve also decided that it couldn’t hurt to share this struggle with you and ask for some guidance.

I’ve had a strange year, I started it out pretty confident in myself and my decisions. And now I am struggling most days just to smile, I cry at the drop of a hat and can’t seem to escape this oppressive weight that holds me down. 

Today a man that I really liked sent me an apology. It made me smile, but also brought me a lot of emotions. I know him to be a really good man who is very focused and self driven. Our encounter was something I would not forget lightly. He set a standard that had me choosing to forego dating for a while and just become the person I want to be instead. 

He told me that I reminded him of his ex after a night together and while that hurt me deeply I understood that from a very personal perspective. That is after all what this year has been teaching me in some big ways, to remain curious instead of knowing. That way it’s always a beautiful surprise when someone lets you see their vulnerability. 

He asked if we could go to coffee so he could apologize in person. I don’t know if that would be good for him with where he is at on his healing journey no matter how much I may want to see him. I also wonder about subconscious motives. I have my heart a little guarded after the events of this past year. Heartbreakingly, I have also learned that once someone feels you moving on from them they reach back out to see how much of a pull they have on you. 

I also don’t feel good enough for him. My life is in shambles after this past year. But my brief encounter with him made me want to become the kind of woman a guy like him is looking for. It gave me the focus that I needed to start living my life for me instead of by somebody else’s rules. 

I hope the morning light brings new clarity and your gentle words of wisdom.",1,1765778545.0,u_thorny-apple,0,1.0,False

“Impressed, newrealmer?” Asked Ilunor in his squeaky, haughty voice as my skin bristled under the elevated magic levels of our silence bubble which had thankfully concentrated on its edge and not within, “for all your realm’s displays of fleshcrafting and craftsmanship, that you would gawk at something as elementary as food is rather telling. Your realm must be truly impoverished if such a sight as this is a novelty for you.”

I had been staring blankly as my hopes of having a simple breakfast to adjust to the mana in my food was doomed the moment a literal pancake ziggurat complete with waffled masonry, syrup *waterfalls*, and bite-sized bonsai berry bushes was placed before me. I didn’t have the heart to turn down a work of art that was only a piglets worth of bacon-strips short of being an info-sphere classic. The sugar and carbs were at least real. I had feared it was going to be made of some magically delicious artificial sweetener, but aside from the rather alarming mana readout from my eye implant it seemed that food was not going to be a concern.

The matter of filing a complaint was less straight forward. 

Unlike a normal school, university, or any government or corporate organization for that matter, there didn’t appear to be a dedicated department for administration, student services, public relations, human resources, or anything like that. Nor was there a dedicated attache or any of the typical channels of communication one would expect from an assembly of representatives from hundreds of nations – or realms – to engage with diplomacy. There wasn’t even something as basic as a front desk, though given the academy’s location up on a local mountain they likely weren’t expecting much in the way of visitors.

Everything went through the professors and their apprentices, and in turn any such attempts to communicate with them was convoluted by *hours* of time wasting social niceties and waiting periods, and that was *if* said invoker had *privileges*! I darkly wondered how the Nexus could stand up if it ever faced a true crisis given that every available communication channel was crammed with inefficiencies and time wasters, but luckily for me that wasn’t my problem. All I needed to do was lodge a complaint and then that would be it.

The only member of faculty present in the dining hall was the apprentice from the night before, everyone else was busy with the yearbook. It wasn’t ideal, but it was all I had, and I was intent on speaking to her after breakfast.

Until then, I was stuck with Ilunor’s annoying attempts at one-upsmanship.

“No, I’ve seen things like this before,” I said, flicking to some pictures of elaborate gingerbread storefronts on my tablet and shining it in his face, “I was just hoping for something simpler than a sunday brunch. You know, like coffee and bagels with cream cheese, or cinnamon french toast, or vanilla yogourt with fruit, that sort of thing.”

Thalmin turned his head.

“*Vanilla* yogourt?” He asked.

“Well, it doesn’t have to be *plain* vanilla. It could be blueberry yogourt, or banana chocolate, or kiwi and almond, or pina colada...” I said.

“I believe Prince Thalmin’s point of contention is that you would mix what is presumably a spice in with fermented milk, particularly as a default,” Thacea commented.

“Well, yeah, why would we eat bland food? Does the Nexus have a spice shortage?” I asked, confused.

“Of course not! Spices would be wasted upon the common folk,” declared Ilunor as he downed what I could only describe as rainbow dinosaur eggs on oatmeal sprinkled with *smaller* dinosaur eggs, “they should be reserved only for the finest of dishes, not wasted on *milk*.”

“Fine cuisine and flavoured food are not mutually exclusive, there is no reason to enact something as repressive as artificial scarcity,” I said as I tactically dismantled my breakfast, ignoring the itching sensation of the exclusion-zone grade foodstuffs and trying to relish in the fact that there was some actual flavour in my food this time, even if it was a little flat.

“Oh, but there is, newrealmer! If commoners were to start living to the same standards as nobility, they might start getting it into their heads that they *are* equal. Better to keep them in their place than have to put them down when they start getting ideas,” said Ilunor dismissively. 

I simmered at his words that preached inequality, but by now the shock of learning that this so-called enlightened world preached such backwards and archaic practices had worn off somewhat.

“The role of the state is to serve the needs of its people,” I countered bluntly, giving Ilunor a stern glare, “having an aristocratic class leaching off the backs of hard working *citizens* would run counter to that.”

Ilunor caught my eye with a dismissive glance and let out an amused chuckle.

“Nobility serving the whims of the common folk? What a laughably unstable polity. Tell me, newrealmer, why haven’t you seized power for yourself?” He asked, clasping his hands and leaning forwards expectantly.

“Excuse me?!” I asked, nearly choking on my food at the audacity of the question. I had to double-check with my translator display that my mitochondrial boosted ability to learn new languages the thousands of hours spent in Nexian language immersion simulations hadn’t failed me and I had, in fact, heard him correctly.

“You hail from a mana-deficient realm of weak-fielders, that much is evident. Likewise, your ruling class must also be weak-fielders if they cannot even assert their rule over commoners. And yet, despite being mana-deficient yourself you have demonstrated... capabilities... beyond what even a gifted commoner or a lesser noble can achieve, certainly greater than what your *predecessor* managed. Likewise, your penchant for the works of artificers and aid from philosophers rather than that of other flesh-sculptors suggests your abilities to be a rarity in Earthrealm, possibly unique. And yet you claim *kinship* and *service* towards commoners, eating like them in spite of your wealth and speaking with their mannerisms in spite of your education, and rattling on about giving away privileges to the very people you should be lording over by right. So I ask again, newrealmer, why are you letting this power void persist rather than claiming it for yourself?” Explained Ilunor, his tail wagging expectantly.

I stared at Ilunor with my eyes wide and mouth agape in disgust at his casual treasonous suggestion. Even if he had not been severely underestimating the GUN’s capacity to deal with bad actors and technological capabilities, and even if a successful power grab would risk undermining the very institutions that allowed for our high standard of living, the fact of the matter was that I had no interest in becoming Director, never mind becoming some sort of Immortal God Queen Empress of Humanity. 

Of course, what *I* wanted mattered little if my mitochondria started getting ideas and decided to influence me or seize control of me herself. That had been a deciding factor behind why the IAS went behind my Aunt’s back yet again and sent me to the Dryfield blacksite on Mars as part of their retroactively ironic ‘Queen’ project to, among other things, implant inhibitors that would neutralize me in the event that they went rogue.

Some people never learn.

“Putting aside the *many* reasons that would be a terrible idea, my Aunt would suit up in power armour and come here personally to knock some sense into me and all parties involved if she caught the slightest inkling that I had gone bad,” I said sternly, making a note to explain our political structure at a better time.

“Went *bad*?” Said Ilunor with a scoff, “newrealmer, there is nothing wrong with claiming your rightful place. We would merely be bringing enlightenment to a lawless land!”

“We?” I noted, squinting.

“Well, of course! It would be irresponsible of me to allow you to stumble around in the dark on the path to civility, but under my guidance and overlordship, even a newrealmer such as yourself from a realm as backwards and deprived of mana as yours can attain the universal truths,” said Ilunor, nearly giddy off his own hype and furiously wagging his tail.

“So that’s your angle,” I said dryly after listening to his pyramid scheme pitch that would not have been out of place on an episode of *Tigers Pit*, “I’m not interested.”

Ilunor blinked, and his tail drooping slightly.

“Not interested? How could you not be interested? Any other adjacent realmer would... ah, I see it now, newrealmer. You persist in your trickery even now, bluffing your true intent in the forelorn hopes that you might have some leverage! Well, newrealmer, is that it?” Demanded Ilunor.

Before I could respond, Thalmin raised his hand.

“Perhaps rather than trying to provoke a reaction from Lieutenant Booker, we should instead discuss the narrative regarding Emma’s nature. Namely, her apparent absence of a manafield, her talents which mimic that of magic, and her superficially Elvenform appearance” said Thalmin.

“I would protest that claim,” said Ilunor with a huff, “and did we not agree that the newrealmer would sculpt herself a proper manafield?”

“We do not yet know that she can,” said Thacea, “it would be prudent to have a narrative prepared for the scenario in which Emma *cannot* practice magic prior to the house-choosing ceremony.”

“Can’t we just say the truth?” I offered, “I mean, last night everyone witnessed me regenerate without using magic. Is it that much of a stretch to say we do things differently?”

“Your *supposed* truth would make us a laughingstock, newrealmer, as it would go against the narrative dictated by the fundamental truths,” said Ilunor.

“Lying isn’t an option either,” growled Thalmin, “passing off Emma’s talents as magic during the house choosing ceremony will only serve to ostracize us when it is revealed that she cannot do even the most basic of spells in the classroom setting.”

“If I may offer a suggestion,” started Thacea cautiously, “perhaps we should discuss this matter with the faculty? They will have to address this issue as well, and it may be to our benefit to work with them to create a coherent narrative.”

“And you think the faculty will be at all *flexible* when it comes to the fundamental truths?” Retorted Ilunor.

“The alternative is that we engage in a *conflicting* narrative,” growled Thalmin, “it would be better to be on the same page as them, and as an added benefit they may be able to best guide us on how to navigate the house trials given they are the final arbiters in that matter.”

“I was planning on speaking with a member of the faculty anyways,” I sighed, “I can’t say I’m thrilled at the idea of working with the faculty given the events last night, but I see the logical benefits of doing so. I’m in favour.”

We discussed our strategy over as I kept an eye on the clock, waiting for the hour to cross over and breakfast to end so I could approach the apprentice. As such, I was caught completely off guard when my skin started to *melt* and my display lit up to indicate a generalized surge of mana-radiation 10 times that of background levels. My vision faded, the itching pain went away, and my mind went blank as I went into a dream.

&nbsp;

...

&nbsp;

I awoke.

Strange sensations came from everywhere as I came into being. I knew not what they meant as my awareness expanded from a point to the edges of a shifting, flattened form. Nor did I understand the space I was in, or the static things or protected shells of life that stood erect at the edges of it, but I knew one thing. A purpose. A Name. A whisper etched within my hollow core.

*Emma Booker*

I knew not what this Emma Booker was. The name was tied to an absence. It was a memory of nothing, a void that needed to be filled. I peered towards the moving forms. Were *they* Emma Booker? They each had a presence about their forms, yet none of them compelled me towards them beyond an inkling of knowledge. A tiny echo of a name, of a form.

I raised myself up into a loose shape, unable to keep my own form, and lurched in their direction. I did not make it far. A harsh, unpleasant pain surged throughout me as the room was filled with a blinding, searing light that destroyed the very space around me and removed a portion of my form. I knew not what had happened, only that these living forms had caused it, and from there I felt a second desire.

A desire to flee.

I moved away from the forms as fast as I could as the space was filled with new lights and vibrations, each one diminishing my form further, and each one teaching me new patterns of movement. The space had expanded, shifted, even melted in a painful glow, yet in this new space between the solid forms I found a gap, wide enough for my hollow core, yet as I slipped through it I found it too narrow for most of my living shell to follow me before it too was painfully removed.

Yet though the new space I was in was devoid of the dangerous forms, I kept moving. Running. Hiding from their presences. My shell had been reduced, but it was enough to survive.

*Emma Booker*

The whisper pushed me forwards, feeding my desire to be rid of this hollow form and to become whole as I made my way through these unexplored spaces.

*Emma Booker*

&nbsp;

...

&nbsp;

“Emma Booker!” Growled a voice.

I opened my eyes with a jolt. My head felt a little fuzzy after what I could only describe as a bad trip. One that I wasn’t sure was over, as the source of the voice appeared to be some sort of wolf-man.

“Where am I? Am I dreaming?” I asked, still somewhat disorientated.

“Emma, *era uoy thgirla?*” Asked a vaguely familiar talking bird in a surreal, elegant, yet decidedly *alien* tongue.

“What’s this about a gorilla? I really must be dreaming,” I muttered to myself.

“*Ho taerg, ti smees taht eht remlaerwen sah neeb* possessed by a feral forest demon and now she is speaking in gutteral gibberish,” complained a conveniently football-sized blue lizard that, to my displeasure, I recognized as Ilunor.

“No, no, I’m fine, I’m just a little dazed from a weird dream, that’s all. I just need a moment to recover, that’s all, see?” I said. I tried to get up to prove my point, but my co-ordination failed me and I fell back in my seat.

“Fine? Newrealmer, we watched your face shrivel up and melt with your eyes staring forward in a vacant, gooey, *corpse-like* state for almost a minute! I’m surprised your soul is still tethered, presuming you aren’t, in fact, the shambling corpse of a lich,” rambled Ilunor in a tone that *almost* expressed concern.

“Oh, well I guess that mana surge must have fried my brain for a bit there. Healing factors, am I right?” I said with a chuckle.

“While I applaud your bravado, Emma, this is a rather serious matter. We were starting to be concerned that our peer group would need a replacement,” said Thalmin.

“Indeed, most would not be so quick to shrug off being so close to one’s *third death*,” cawed Thacea with concern.

“Oh, well, you would be surprised what a girl can get used to,” I said with a shrug, but after seeing their worried faces I backpedalled a bit, “look, I’m sorry for giving you guys a fright. I guess I’m a little desensitized to this sort of thing.”

“I will not ask what sort of existence has brought you to near death enough to justify this lack of reaction, but given your current state I must insist upon a visit to the Healing Wing,” stated Thalmin.

“I mean, are you sure that is a good idea? I would think bombarding me with *more* magic when magic itself is the issue would only make things worse,” I replied, “couldn’t we just bring this up with the faculty when we speak to the apprentice?”

“The apprentice isn’t here,” said Thalmin.

“What?” I replied.

“As you were *harmonizing* before everyone’s eyes, our dear apprentice span a narrative of this being a mere *ebb* in the manastreams before dashing off in a frenzied rush,” said Ilunor.

“Oh. I see,” I said, disappointed.

I was a little shocked to learn that the apprentice had chosen to abandon a *dying student*, and less shocked to learn that the bystander effect applied to the rest of the student body, but I had come to expect that from the Nexus. What really bothered me was the missed opportunities. Not only had I missed a chance to speak with or arrange a meeting with a member of the faculty, but also my best chance at finding out what had *caused* that surge. 

Had I been lucid, I could have dusted her with my mitochondria or deployed a drone to follow her. Instead, I had been completely neutralized by this generalized mana surge without so much as a chance to mount a defence as I had with the yearbook. The change had been too sudden and extreme to adapt to, sterilizing all cells that weren’t protected by the mana resistant alloys which had been incorporated into my skeletal structure, and it was only through good fortune that it was brief enough not to kill me off outright. Like it or not, this was *not* an acceptable state of affairs, and at that I was forced to take Thalmin’s suggestion seriously.

“Regarding the Healing Wing, what could they even do for me? As I said before, healing magic would only hurt me, and given that my physiology is different than yours a doctor might come to the wrong conclusion,” I said, trying to placate Thalmin by listing my chief concerns, as well as leaving out for the moment the fact that my mitochondria weren’t exactly *agreeable* with people studying it even at the best of times.

“The nurses in the Healing Wing would expect some portion of those from lesser adjacent realms to have difficulties adjusting to the Nexus and as such would be trained for dealing with the effects of mana sickness, as well as blessings to protect from it,” offered Thacea.

“A blessing? In *our* peergroup?” Scoffed Ilunor, “and suffer the jeers of our peerage rather than work on the newrealmer’s mana field?”

“I would think that could be dealt with *after* we ensure Emma isn’t one wayward prank away from death? Some light mockery of Emma’s difficulties with mana sickness is worth that peace of mind,” retorted Thalmin.

“I have some concerns about what these blessings entail, considering they are presumably *still* magic, but if they can offer *any* protection from something like that mana surge, then I think I have to at least look into it,” I said at last, earning me a nod of approval from Thacea and Thalmin, and a snort of derision from Ilunor.

“Oh, the trials and tribulations you put me through, newrealmer,” said Ilunor, tilting his head up in a dramatic huff, “but as leader of this peer group, it is my duty to see to your well being. As such, I have made the decision that I shall lead you to the healing wing for this... handicap... for the sake of your *temporary* protection until such a time that you can sculpt yourself a manafield... with my guidance, of course!”

Baffled by this display, I glanced towards Thalmin and Thacea, who each merely shrugged.

“Alright Ilunor, take us to the Healing Wing.”

I M20 posted a couple months ago about me and my GF F20 arguing. She said she was late to work, but it turns out she had gone to the lake with her girlfriend and her girlfriends boyfriend. However, something felt off and I told her how I felt and it turned out she was lying to me and had decided to skip work and go to the lake with her guy friend. While I hadn't met this guy friend, he was very new to my girlfriend and me as she began talking to him a couple month into our relationship. Anyway, this guyfriend became very close to my girlfriend and began driving her places and inviting her over to his house after she got off. He also admitted to having feelings for her a few times, but that he wanted her ""as a friend"". After this, I began questioning this guy. I only heard about him from what my GF told me about him, but everytime she'd hang out with him and she'd snapchat me, he wanted to speak to me and he'd ignore me completely, which further felt very odd. She was also very short when she would be on the phone with me around him.

Fast forward a month after that lake incident with this guy, he invited her to his house and she obliged and decided to go there with him late at night. She told me he was being very close and personal with him, but she kind of liked it. This disturbed me very much so. He then invited her to the club with him alone and apparently he kissed her a few times but my GF told me it ""wasn't actually him"" as he was drunk, but I felt otherwise. She said she'd cut contact with him though after that as she ""felt she was getting too close to him and wanted to step back"". Anyway, a few weeks after that and he invited her to a Christmas event, she accepted and went. I told her it made me feel uncomfortable and reminded her that she told me she wasn't going to hang out with him anymore and she asked me if I trust her. She ended up going, and it made me so uncomfortable. I was irritated, but it's like I've almost become numb to it like if I say something, everything will go down, so I just went with the flow. A few weeks passed and everything was going well between us. I managed to throw away my irritation and look to the positives, but everything that has happened has lingered with me. Last week, she posted a snap saying ""Thank you babe 😘 ❤️"", holding a coffee. I learned about this from a family member who's always friends with her on snap. She saw the post and asked me, ""Are you with your girlfriend? She posted this snap."" I went to snap to find the post and asked my GF about it. I asked her why she posted that if I didn't get her a coffee, and she told me it wasn't directed towards me. I asked her who it was directed towards and she asked me if I trust her and how it seems like I don't trust her. I told her I was simply curious who she directed that to. She told me it didn't matter but then told me she refers to her friends as ""babe"" often. I was like, ""You know what, that makes sense. Some women do refer to their friends as babe"". 

That night, we were talking it out and she told me she slept with another guy friend before we were official and asked if that mattered to me. I told her it didn't matter as we weren't actually exclusive yet. It didn't match up though. That night she referred to when she slept with the guy friend, she said his girlfriend was there with him in the same apartment. I asked her about that and she said they broke up when she was there with him and they did it after the break up. Having  been lied to before by her, I tried to believe her, but I feel so disturbed about this as the stories don't match up and she has shown to lie about this stuff before. If she was the other one in that situation, who's to say she's not cheating on me. She has told me that she cheated on her ex out of anger that he cheated on her, but she told me that she was stupid for that. I thought it was over after that, but today she sent me an sms message saying ""You can come over I will wait for you 😘😉"". This once again started the cycle again. I asked her if this was meant for me and she said it wasn't. I asked her who it was from and she started sending me messages about our sex life. I figured she was trying to change the subject. I asked her once again who it was meant for and she said it didn't matter. I told her it did matter and that if she has feelings for someone, just let me know so I can move on. I told her it was flirtatious and she denied that. She's now sending me messages telling me everything was a mistake with me and she shouldn't have been honest about anything.

I really don't know what to do. I feel like an insecure piece of shit for this,  but at the same time, my trust for her is definitely damaged and for me that's hard to gain back.",1,1765778348.0,WhatShouldIDo,0,1.0,False

What I Learned After Cutting Through the Noise,"https://preview.redd.it/08qsn5555b7g1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a4647586adeada391bb9a757a531888a9b11ed8

I’ve been digging around for some straightforward info on EHS software lately, and honestly, most of what I found felt either overly technical or way too promotional. So I figured I’d write out what I’ve learned in plain language, the way someone might explain it over coffee rather than in a corporate meeting. If you’ve been curious about EHS software and haven’t found a simple explanation, this might help.

# So… what is EHS software?

At its core, EHS stands for Environment, Health, and Safety. Every workplace—no matter the size—has some responsibility in those areas. The challenge is that once a company grows past a certain point, keeping track of everything with paper forms, emails, or random spreadsheets just doesn’t cut it anymore.

EHS software is basically a centralized system that takes all those scattered safety and environmental tasks and puts them in one organized place. Instead of guessing where a report went or who followed up on what, you can actually see everything clearly.

# What does EHS software actually help with?

Here’s the down-to-earth version of what most EHS platforms do:

* **Incident Reporting:**  When something goes wrong—or almost goes wrong—you log it, track it, and make sure it gets resolved. No more “Did anyone follow up on that?” moments.  
* **Risk Assessments:**  Helps teams look at hazards, rate them, and prioritize fixes. It’s basically a way to spot trouble before trouble spots you.  
* **Inspections and Audits:**  Instead of clipboards and messy handwritten notes, everything is done digitally. It saves a ton of time and makes repeated tasks consistent.  
* **Compliance Tracking:**  Permits, deadlines, legal requirements, internal policies… it keeps them all in one place. This alone can save people from a lot of last-minute panic.  
* **Training Records:**  It tracks who’s trained, who’s overdue, and who needs refreshers. Super helpful when you’re dealing with multiple teams or shifts.  
* **Document Management:**  No more digging through old folders or wondering if you’re looking at the right version of a safety manual. Everything stays updated.  
* **Analytics & Reports:**  Probably the most underrated part. When the system shows you patterns—like repeat hazards or departments struggling with the same issue—it becomes much easier to prevent bigger problems.  

Some platforms even handle environmental stuff like waste, air emissions, or sustainability tracking, which is becoming a bigger deal for a lot of companies.

# Why does EHS software matter?

In short: it reduces chaos.  
 Companies usually start thinking about EHS software once they realize too many things are slipping through the cracks. A missed training, a misplaced report, or a forgotten deadline can turn into costly problems. A good system helps keep everyone accountable and informed without drowning in paperwork.

Another big advantage is that it helps shift the culture from “reactive” to “proactive.” Instead of scrambling whenever something happens, you start seeing patterns and fixing root causes early.

# A personal observation

Something I’ve noticed from people working with well-established systems (like [EHS Insight](https://www.ehsinsight.com/) and a few others) is that the biggest value isn’t fancy features—it’s the structure. When reporting is simple and everything is traceable, people actually use the system. And when people use the system, safety genuinely improves.

# Final thoughts

If your workplace is still managing EHS tasks with scattered tools or outdated methods, an EHS platform can make life a lot easier. It keeps things organized, boosts accountability, and helps build a stronger safety culture without adding complexity.

Hopefully this gives a clearer, more human explanation of what EHS software is all about. And if anyone else here has experience with different systems, I’d love to hear how it worked for you—everyone’s setup seems a little different, and that’s what makes these discussions useful.

1pmzzz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirFranceKLM/comments/1pmzzz1/air_france_left_luggage_recovery_success_story/,Air France Left Luggage - Recovery Success Story,"Short story: 

I left one piece of luggage at the carousel at Air France at CDG. We had 4 and we only picked up 3. So you know, it becomes Air France’s responsibility not the airport. Go to the baggage claim you arrived in. Air France is in one circular terminal with two sides so it’s really not hard to get from one of the two terminals to the other. You can cross the parking lot or there is a passage way. 

They let me in to talk to the baggage service with my name and passport number. I explained the situation to them and they were quite nice. Air France has a huge kiosk inside the baggage claim. Know your ticket number and baggage claim tags. It helped expedite the process sooo much. They found the bag immediately even naming the color and type. Wherever it was it took 40 mins to come out and I made it to my flight no problem. 

Takeaway: I was shocked, it was amazing! It was how smooth you imagine an airport should work, for a large airport they were so on top of it. I am so impressed. JFK could never.  

Less important details: 
Of course we didn’t realize until after we picked up our rental car from Hertz (highly recommend actually, we booked the day before and they had good prices for 4 days, 600 miles) and had already driven into le marais to our airbnb. It was heartbreaking because it had my favorite sweater and my boyfriend’s workout clothes and dress shoes (we were going to a wedding in NY after Paris). 

We had a job outside the city for 3 days, tried to submit all of the online forms (with no luck). We couldn’t find any info about how to coordinate getting a bag back from the airport. I tried to call but in the end couldn’t figure out if it was CDG airport or Air France’s jurisdiction. In this case it is the airline, Air France. I arrived back to the airport 4 days later. We went to the correct baggage claim we arrived in. They were very nice and took down my name and passport number in order to re-enter baggage claim. They pointed us in the direction of Air France baggage services. No line! The two people at the desk were lovely. We DID have our luggage tag numbers with us which was lucky because they tracked it down within 2 minutes. They told us it would be out at carousel 21 in about 40minutes or sooner. It was exactly 40btw maybe even 45. I went and checked in our other bags to not miss the check in but luckily it was so smooth. We secured the bag and maybe it in time to grab some coffee at Starbucks and a cheesey sandwich before getting on the plane. Easy peasy. 

Thought I’d share because i wish I found something that said it would work out and what to do. ",1,1765778158.0,AirFranceKLM,0,1.0,False

1pmzxzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pmzxzj/grooming_predatory_behaviors/,"Grooming, predatory behaviors","At a family gathering we were about to eat dinner my FIL asked when is our next trip as we were in the middle of telling him he quickly responded, “I’ll watch her” assuming that we will leave our daughter while we leave the country. We responded, thanks for offering but we are taking her. He seemed disappointed that he couldn’t take advantage of this situation. In my gut I do not trust this man. He have purposely try to get my toddler to do yoga poses like downward dog as he taps her on her butt. When she was younger she had hiccups and he claimed that he made them go away. I asked how, he responded “it’s grandpas secrets” Just stupid crap like that. Every visit he had with my daughter he would find out her interests through my husband and gift her things she likes.

He married a woman without telling us until two days later who he known for two years and she is as creepy as he is (we probably meet her 10 times over that time frame).

Once we had dinner at a restaurant she said to my daughter “go give grandpa a kiss and I’ll play with you.” My skin crawled as I watched my child trying to process this she didn’t do it . This woman is telling her to do stuff like this in front of us I can’t imagine if we’re not around. When gifts are given this woman would say it’s from grandpa he got you the gift.

Then he lied to my husband saying that his nephews have already started to call this woman grandma along with them addressing the gifts from grandpa and grandma it’s a bit forceful don’t you think we barely know this woman.

This woman has try to force my daughter to do these things after I mentioned to her months ago that we are teaching about boundaries. Then she pushes the boundaries. Following this topic  she later said came up with a story and said kids lie all the time about things. Trying to disregard how I want to teach my child about boundaries. This is when I realize that she is not a girls girls.

Besides that this woman would over compliment my husband and say how much of a great father he is in front of me over and over  again multiple times in a day. Every encounter we had with her she made sure to over compliment him non stop and take a liking to pay a lot of attention to my daughter and bringing her gifts.

They would isolate my husband  and take an interest in him and my daughter like I’m not there. This is the problem!!!! They don’t try to build a relationship with me. They treat it as he’s the only parent in this relationship. Any questions they have they ask him. Any checks my FIL writes as a gift it’s addressed to him not us.

During a recent gathering his dad asked if he could watch our daughter over a long weekend. He purposefully bypass me as the mother and only asked my husband. My husband said no to him anyways because he thinks he’s creepy over 10 years ago he went in naked in the hot tub with his nephews. One of his nephews told me grandpa gave me coffee once and I fell asleep… what does that even mean!? not normal if you ask me.

I wish it was not like this - I feel it in my gut that these two  are  predatory and I have no doubt that she would turn a blind eye if something happens to my child. I feel like I need therapy for this. They don’t understand “no”

I forgot to add they got a necklace for our daughter and it was a key with a a heart (where the loop is) that woman said it’s a key to grandpa’s heart.  My daughter chewed on it and broke it by accident. Thank goodness no more necklace. I was going to throw it away if it made its way home anyways.",12,1765777968.0,AITAH,19,0.93,False

I owned up to the mistake and have been more cautious ever since to prevent this mistake from happening. Fast forward to this week, I wanted to do something nice for her (buying her lunch) since she was sick. But it seemed like it might have triggered this feeling of being overwhelmed again, even though I tried to circumvent and prevent it from happening again like contacting her and coordinating with her. I am not sure what I can do or say to gain her trust back and prevent her from feeling overwhelmed when I just want to bring a smile to her face. I love being spontaneous and enjoy the small things like buying lunch or coffee for the people I care about. Money is not an issue to me, so to me, buying a lunch or coffee is a normal thing. 

Now I understand I tend to have this ""nice guy"" syndrome where I project my wants/needs subconsciously onto my actions without realizing it. I mentioned about getting coffee for her. While I genuinely care about her and want to cheer her up with coffee, my fixation on getting her that coffee is what ultimately led to this disaster. Because in my mind, her getting coffee = happiness, and she will like me more if she is happy. This is something I have come to realize over the last few days while reading the book ""No More Mr Nice Guy"" written by Robert Glover. 

Just a bit more context, she is someone who doesn't reply to text messages very often, usually takes 20-24 hours to reply. I am by no means a ""Sticky"" person, and I give her all the space in the world to reply to me whenever she can and vice versa. I understand she has a life aside from texting with me. However, since she is not great at replying to text messages, and I don't know if a spontaneous phone call would be a good idea due to the nature of her work, as it can be disturbing, it has caused me a lot of anxiety just waiting for a reply. Also, it feels like we are always talking about the past rather than the present because of that 20-24 hour delay. It's very difficult to coordinate something that's spontaneous. I don't know how to bring this up without hurting her feelings, and for her to potentially end the relationship, which I don't want. I like her a whole lot and do want to get to know her more and grow with her. She has had a few bad relationships in the past, so I feel like she's very guarded. I have a big heart, and I really do like her and want to be there for her, but I just don't know how to not be overwhelming. I have chatted with her recently about this whole situation, and she is unsure about us potentially moving forward. She is happy to continue to see me and get to know me more but I feel like this relationship is slipping away. What can I do to gain her trust back and prevent this? Any advice is welcome!

I had only a few panic attacks in my life but I was always ready to ground myself but two days ago I drove home from a christmas party. I had only 5 hours of sleep, drunk a very strong coffee and took a ibuprofen for my migraine and I thought I can manage it back home (takes me roughly 1 h 15 min to drive home)

Well, I was fine at first. But then on the middle of the highway with 4 fucking lanes, my thoughts start to spiral and everything is too much. All the cars around me and the speed we were driving was starting to trigger the worst panic attack in my life. 

I felt numb in all my limbs and I depersonalized so hard that I couldn’t even change the lane anymore, it was fucking scary. I tried to breathe, listen to the radio, pinch myself, try to calm myself down somehow but it was only barely working.

I managed to get on the highway with only two lanes which helped a little bit. I knew when I was going to stop, I wouldn’t step into the car anymore that’s why I called my coworker who is also my dear friend and told her the situation I was in. She talked to me over an hour and always managed to calm me down when the next wave hit me.

I still have no idea why I would get a full blown panic attack. I don’t love driving but I also don’t hate it that much that this would stress me out so much. Maybe it was the whole combination that caused it but it scared me to death.

Ever feel like you're hustling 24/7 but your bank account isn’t reflecting the grind? Yeah, me too. That’s why I’ve been diving deep into AI-powered passive income streams—and let me tell you, the future is *now*. In 2026, AI isn’t just a buzzword; it’s your side hustle’s new best friend. Here are **three actionable ways** to turn AI into a content-based money-making machine while you sleep (or binge-watch your favorite show 🍿).

---

### **1. AI-Generated Niche Blogs (The “Set It & Forget It” Goldmine)**
Remember when blogging meant staring at a blank screen for hours? **Not anymore.** Tools like Jasper, SurferSEO, and even free AI writers can crank out hyper-targeted blog posts in minutes. Here’s the playbook:
- **Pick a micro-niche** (think “vegan meal prep for busy nurses” or “budget gaming setups for college students”).
- **Use AI to generate 10-20 SEO-optimized posts** (tools like Frase or Clearscope help with keywords).
- **Monetize with ads (Ezoic/Mediavine) + affiliate links** (Amazon Associates, ShareASale, etc.).
- **Automate social shares** with Buffer or Hootsuite to drive traffic.

**Pro tip:** Use AI to repurpose blog content into Twitter threads, LinkedIn carousels, or even YouTube scripts. **One piece of content → endless repurposing = passive income on steroids.**

---

### **2. AI-Powered Faceless YouTube Channels (The “No Camera, No Problem” Hack)**
You don’t need to be MrBeast to make bank on YouTube. **AI voiceovers + stock footage + automation = passive income while you Netflix.**
- **Niche down:** Think “AI-generated true crime stories” or “AI-narrated history deep dives.”
- **Use tools like:**
  - **ElevenLabs** (for ultra-realistic AI voiceovers).
  - **Pictory** or **InVideo** (to auto-generate videos from scripts).
  - **TubeBuddy** (for SEO optimization).
- **Monetize with AdSense + sponsorships** (once you hit 1K subs).

**Bonus:** Use AI to auto-generate captions, thumbnails (Canva’s AI tools), and even video ideas based on trending topics. **Your channel runs itself while you sip coffee. ☕**

---

### **3. AI-Curated Newsletters (The “Lazy Person’s Media Empire”)**
Newsletters are back, baby—and AI makes them **effortless**. Platforms like Beehiiv or Substack let you automate *everything*.
- **Pick a niche** (e.g., “AI tools for solopreneurs” or “daily crypto trends”).
- **Use AI to:**
  - **Curate content** (tools like Curated.co or FeedHive).
  - **Write summaries** (ChatGPT + custom prompts).
  - **Schedule sends** (automate with ConvertKit or Mailchimp).
- **Monetize with:**
  - **Sponsorships** (once you hit 5K+ subs).
  - **Affiliate links** (promote tools you use).
  - **Paid subscriptions** (offer exclusive AI-generated insights).

**Example:** I know a guy who runs a “daily AI tool roundup” newsletter—**100% AI-generated, 0 manual work, $3K/month in sponsorships.**

---

### **Final Thought: The Future is Automated (And So Should Your Income)**
The key? **Start small, automate fast, and scale smart.** AI isn’t replacing creators—it’s giving us superpowers.

**Oh, and one more thing…** I recently stumbled on a community that’s all about **automated reselling with guaranteed 10x ROI**. They send daily “secret deal” alerts, and I’m testing it out. If you’re curious, here’s my affiliate link to check it out: [https://clipwise.ai/?utm_source=affiliate&linkId=lp_603470&sourceId=liveitup-deals&tenantId=clipwise&affS1=reddit].

King of Africa 74110 Ethiopian Mystery Code Combination. 741xx, xx110, xxxxx – 74110 These magical numbers combine to create a flavor reminiscent of a geisha. The cupper exclaimed after tasting it, ""This citrus, wild ginger, and Earl Grey tea flavor is just like a geisha!"" Whether it's related to geisha remains to be seen. We will continue to explore the mysterious ancient country of Ethiopia with its thousand-year history. With a more stable political and economic situation, we can better study the unique varieties and characteristics, gradually systematizing the varietals. The Xitang Coffee bean-finding team's trip to Ethiopia will allow for a deeper exploration of the interaction between terroir, varieties, and cultivation, leading to a clearer understanding of the right coffee.

●Crisis and Opportunity

In the natural environment, natural disasters and pests occur every few years. In 1971 (50 years ago), Ethiopian coffee suffered a severe pest infestation, greatly damaging local coffee varieties. Therefore, between 1974 and 1975, agricultural units worked to find solutions. Ethiopia has tens of thousands of native coffee varieties, and fortunately, in 1974, agricultural units collected 76 native mother plants in Metu (Metu is in Oromia Province in southwestern Ethiopia). After several years of propagation, the 74110 variety was confirmed to be resistant to pests and also had excellent flavor and yield. It was officially announced in 1979 and propagated as a single variety in various producing areas. 74110 is suitable for planting at altitudes of 1500-2100m. Due to its ease of cultivation and unique round and full-bodied flavor, it has been widely planted in Ethiopia.

● Charming flavors of wild ginger and citrus

74110 boasts a delightfully rounded palate with notes of berries, strawberries, cocoa, cream, honey, and Ethiopian floral aromas. Currently widely cultivated in Ethiopia's coffee-growing regions, the 2021 Excellent Cup Single Variety selection also shines brightly and is highly anticipated.",1,1765777339.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

My only comfort is that she won't talk to me about church stuff. I presume it's because she already knows it's all garbage. We have 4 kids and none of them are invested in the church.

I have an older sister 18 and older brother 21. Neither of them have ever had jobs. My sister is in her last year of high school and my brother is in college. I'm in my first year of high school. 

Our parents work hard to take care of us and I get that. However I don't think it's fair to take my money that I earn to pay for food and stuff for the family when neither my brother or sister has ever contributed. 

So I made a decision and just quit what I was doing to earn money. I no longer babysit for the neighbors and I have given two weeks at the coffee shop where I did a few shifts a week. I applied to be a volunteer at my local public library and I hope to use that experience when I apply to university in library science. I have an education trust fund from my grandparents the same as my siblings so as long as I get accepted I can go to university without help from my parents.

My parents have said that I'm being short sighted by quitting a job and leaving my babysitting clients in the lurch. I said I would continue to work if they let me keep my money. They refused so I said they couldn't force me to work and I will concentrate on my studies so I can try for a scholarship. 

I did tell both sets of grandparents and my parents are pissed about that too. They said that they are adults and do not answer to their parents. I feel a little bad for snitching but not much.

But this Sunday, as he sipped his third cup of church-lobby coffee and tried to dodge a second conversation about the volleyball league’s no-dunking policy, the older boys from the youth group cornered him.

“Yo, Brother Colt,” said Jaden, wearing a sleeveless hoodie that read HOLY GAINS. “We’re doing a Turbo Tots crawl today. You in?”

Colt blinked. “What’s… a Turbo Tots crawl?”

“You don’t know what a Turbo Tots crawl is? That’s a crazy L to take. One meal, six courses, at six different Turbo Tots drive-ins. We got it mapped: drinks, apps, chicken, burgers, mystery round, dessert. It’s like a pub crawl, but with tater tots.”

“Also it’s a ministry opportunity,” added Tyler, whose only spiritual gift was speed-eating footlong chili dogs.

Colt scratched his chin. He was technically off the clock, but this might, on paper, qualify as discipleship.

“I’m driving,” Colt said, immediately regretting it.

Turbo Tots 1: Drinks.
Easy. Everyone got their signature beverage. Colt, trying to impress the boys, ordered a Blue Puddle with extra coconut and lime. It tasted like suntan lotion and regret.

Turbo Tots 2: Appetizers.
Jalapeño poppers, mozzarella sticks, and those weird pickle fries that taste like they were left behind by a traveling carnival. Tyler claimed he once baptized a guy in cherry limeade.

Turbo Tots 3: Chicken.
Things got messy. Jaden threw ranch packets at Brayden, who retaliated by snorting crushed ice and had a brain freeze so paralyzing that he could not defend against being farted on. Colt tried to give a devotion about the loaves and fishes but was interrupted when unintentionally hit in the face by a flying chicken tender.

Turbo Tots 4: Burgers.
Everyone got quiet. There was something sanctifying about eating a greasy double cheeseburger on the side of a regional highway while TobyMac played softly through a Bluetooth speaker.

Then came the fifth Turbo Tots stop of the afternoon. The mystery round. The mistake.

This location had been chosen solely for its convenience on the route to Turbo Tots 6, but there was no parking lot. Just a sign:

“That doesn’t even make sense,” Colt muttered, shaking off his tetraphobia. “But signs don’t lie.”

Persepolis County Garage #4 was dim, low-ceilinged, and deeply un-Turbo Tots-like.

“Maybe it’s like… an urban Turbo Tots?” Jaden offered.

“What is an urban Turbo Tots?” Colt asked.

No one knew, that’s crazy. But they parked anyway.

“Dude,” Brayden whispered. “Your car’s gone.”

A construction crew swarmed like ants.

“Not our fault,” said a guy in a hard hat labeled #1 Pawpaw. “Garage was built during the Carter administration. She was bound to give.”

Then Colt’s First Sergeant from his National Guard unit showed up, in the capacity of a County Sheriff’s Deputy. No one had called him.

“We’re doing a barbecue. Come by. Bring the youthlings.”

Colt asked how he was barbequing while clearly on duty. The First Sergeant did not answer.

This is how they ended up at a three-bedroom ranch conveniently next to Garage #4. The air smelled like mesquite and mild theological tension.

The First Sergeant’s wife, wearing a rhinestone hair claw and a turquoise cross necklace large enough to require a seatbelt, appeared holding a basket of teacup Yorkies.

“Pick one,” she said brightly. “They need Godly homes.”

Colt picked the one with an underbite and a limp. He named it Tribulation.

Tribulation wandered off during the cornhole tournament and was found yapping at a chain-link fence. The neighbor turned out to be Colt’s cousin Nathan, who wore cargo shorts for all of life’s occasions.

“Come see what I’m growing,” Nathan said, without otherwise acknowledging Colt or his teenaged crew.

In the greenhouse, Colt and the church bros saw vines drooping under the weight of tomatoes the size of pumpkins.

Colt reached toward one.
It pulled back.

The skin glowed. Veins of gold pulsed beneath the surface, like lightning trapped in fruit.

“They’re almost ready,” Nathan said.
“Ready for what?” Colt asked.

“For when the ground splits and the sky doesn’t answer. You’ll need seed then. Not noise. Not fear. Seed.”

Before Colt could reply, the tomato cracked open. Blinding, alive, humming.

Everything stopped. The mosquitoes. The wind. The Earth.

Only Tribulation moved, tail wagging like he’d passed a test he didn’t know he was taking.

“Did it just… sing?” Colt asked.
“I wouldn’t call it singing,” Nathan said. “More like… agricultural prophecy.”

Colt gently closed the tomato’s cracked skin like a book he wasn’t ready to read.

“Bro,” Jaden whispered, “we just found the fruit of the Spirit.”
Brayden crossed himself, which made no theological sense, but Colt let it slide.

“Do you have more of these?” Colt asked.

Nathan didn’t answer. He opened a chest freezer in the corner of the greenhouse. Inside, nestled between two frozen lasagnas and what looked like a raccoon skull wrapped in butcher paper, were six vacuum-sealed tomato slices, each glowing faintly.

“Emergency seed.”

Tyler, still sucking on the last of his dessert slush, nodded.

“Respect.”

Suddenly, the First Sergeant shouted: “Time for spiritual charades!”

The Yorkies were dressed as the Twelve Minor Prophets. Colt’s was given a tiny name tag: NAHUM. He decided to go with it.

------‐------------------------------------------------------------

That night, Colt sat on a porch swing with Tribulation, or Nahum, on his lap, watching the stars, fiddling with a complimentary I Brake for Tots! bumper sticker for a car he no longer had, and wondering if his insurance covered artificial sinkholes.

Nathan didn’t answer. He opened a chest freezer in the corner of the greenhouse. Inside, nestled between two frozen lasagnas and what looked like a raccoon skull wrapped in butcher paper, were six vacuum-sealed tomato slices, each glowing faintly.

“Emergency seed.”

Tyler, still sucking on the last of his dessert slush, nodded.

“Respect.”

Suddenly, the First Sergeant shouted: “Time for spiritual charades!”

The Yorkies were dressed as the Twelve Minor Prophets. Colt’s was given a tiny name tag: NAHUM. He decided to go with it.

Lemme preface by mentioning that I live in Canada because it might be helpful for context, although I'd love to get thoughts from people across the world. In your comment please also mention your level of religiosity in your every day life.

  
I like to think of myself as someone who holds a higher standard of haya and piousness for themself, compared to the norms. As in, I don't care what ""everyone in the West/all Muslims in the West"" do or say or if some scholar gave dawa for something to be permissible - if hadith and Quran-wise, it's something impermissible, I'd like to follow that.

  
Good example of this is my view of interest. I'm not looking to take a mortgage (even for a house) or even work in banking, even though scholars in the west say its permissible to own one house on mortgage.

That said, I've recently found myself in a pickle in regards to my interactions with men, specifically Muslim men.

I've been wearing a hijab since I was in middle school and take modesty very seriously; in a time when other hijabis at school were comfortable high-fiving guys, I didn't. It's a small detail but paints the picture.

  
But, I'm also very outgoing and naturally curious, love getting to know people, travel alone, and have worked/lived in different cities before.

I'm in my mid-twenties but not really looking to get married right now, or at least not intentionally settle (I'm a bit of a hopeless romantic and want to naturally meet the person and ""just know""), but I'd also like to keep my window open to the right prospects reaching out with the right intention. For me, I know that when I am ready and intentionally looking, the process will be pretty short and not prolong the dating stage too long without getting families involved.

That said, as a single Muslim woman, I'm starting to struggle with how to interact with Muslim men who want to be friends and hangout/grab coffee etc (but are single themselves).

On one end, I'd like to do that with them (specifically the person I've in mind bc of which I'm posting this) because they truly are a good, well-wishing friend, who I have a common past with (in terms of common university and work experiences). I'm at a stage in life where I'm already having a hard time connecting with folks and have lost many friends (either due to distance, different cities, or just fallen out due to mis-alignment of values).

I've walked away from friend groups because of religious reasons and/or moral values, so on one end, the idea of having a friend who is open-minded in this sense sounds nice. I'm also trying to figure out my next career transition so people like this individual who are from a similar education and work background will be nice. And it's just refreshing to catch up with old colleagues!

But, idk how permisable it is for a male and female to grab coffee (in a public setting ofc) as old colleagues or friends catching up, without any formal work-related purpose behind the meeting?

(Keep in mind - if I were to meet them, I'm naturally very modest in how I speak with a strong voice, open about my level of religiosity standard for myself and generally think men are more reserved & cognizant about their behvaiour around me, as compared to an average hijabi in the West)

I know in the West it's very common for hijabis to be close friends with men and that's not something I'm a fond of personally, but I'm also not of the mindset that's followed in Saudi Arabia where men and women don't mingle at all... 

Does anyone know if the Prophet would grab tea or something of the sort with other Muslim women who he had previously worked or interacted with?

Thinking of every possible reason he could, or could not be attracted to me. Trying to change my appearance I have gained weight, lost weight, grew out my hair, cut my hair, changed my clothes, and changed my perfume. I have changed so much of myself, I lost whoever I was. Changing my appearance and how I spoke to him about us. I wanted him to know, I wanted us to have a better life together. So much has changed, but his interest did not change until recently.

I love our friendship, but I hate this relationship. To cope, with the constant rejection, with the half-hearted apologies and ""plans"" to do better, I severed the part of myself that wanted to be with him romantically. It sounds so cold, and I don't know when it happened, but somewhere along the way I could not stand the pain. This pain that makes me feel numb and hallow on the inside, and tells me this is the best it will ever get.

A deadbedroom is one thing, but he has to be prompted to get near me. The person who says he wants to be my husband, who makes my coffee in the morning, fixes my car issues, asks me about my day, plans trips, makes my favorite foods, tells me I am beautiful, can't show any intimacy.

Maybe he is asexual? I thought so, until I found out, he messaged an ex during a our rough patch. While I was planning to move across the country for a second time, he was planning on swapping me out for another woman. If he would have told me, I would never have moved. At this point if someone else makes him happy, I wouldn't stop him.

Talking about the infidelity, would require emotional intimacy, so like most conversations I was met with silence and a blanket apology. I wish it hurt my feelings, but I don't feel anything anymore. He's a stranger. A few months later, he is a guy I live with, just some guy I talk to and occasionally grab coffee with. He lost the special-ness in my eyes.

This is the moment, he decides to try. Years after I told him, warned him, that this is taking a toll on me. After I told him, I may not be ready to try to make it work, when he is finally ready.

It is odd after begging for something from him, I can't even hear him as speaks. Sound passes, with no meaning and no feeling, between us. I don't know if this is fixable, but I think I am tired.",2,1765776429.0,DeadBedrooms,3,1.0,False

The time and place are just the backdrop for discussing—of course—the key concept of “change,” specifically how the reconciliation of power changes society. They also don’t want me to use the Iranian Revolution in MYP Year 2 (a similar “change” unit).

MYP 1:

• Maps (time, place, and space): I lean into political maps as propaganda and look at disputed territories like Falkland Islands / Islas Malvinas, Cyprus, South China Sea, etc

• Chinese Revoluton(s) (change): see above

• Cradles of Civilization (systems): social hierarchy in Indus Valley, China, Egypt, China

• Gender Roles In Ancient Greek City States: the different lives of men and women in both Sparta and Athens

MYP 2:

• Silk Road (global interactions): more regulated land routes and less regulated but more interdependent ocean routes

• Ancient Asia 1200-1500 (time, place, and space): China, Mongolia, Japan, Indonesia, Viet Nam, Southern India, etc.

• Religion (systems): 7 dimensions of religion with a whole host of examples and then specifically Hinduism and Buddhism as a response and then how Buddhism spread through the Silk Road 

• Iranian Revolution (change): causes and effects of change on different demographics 

MYP 3

• Indutrial Ageiculture (system): monoculture vs poly culture, reliance of pesticides and fertilizers, algal blooms—inputs, process, output, feedback

• Columbian Exchange (change): indigenous farming in Mesoamerica and Andes vs Spanish encomienda system; global population and caloric change

• Industiral Revolution (time, place, and space): urbanization and problem in big cities; look at London

• Tourism (global interactions): look at Caribbean islands and how tourism hast help environment or most locals 

MYP 4

• Anthropocene and Resource Extraction (time place and space): look at sand extraction for concrete needed in urbanization and overfishing in South China Sea for political claims, for example

• International Trade and Resource Distribution (global interactions): absolute vs comparative advantage with oil—UAE, Venezuela, US—and coffee, superconductors, etc

• Urban Revitalization (time, place, and space): pros and cons of urbanization with examples of major city improvement plans like Seoul’s Cheonggyecheon to be judged against “Triple Bottom Line” framework 

• Zoning and Sustainable Cities (systems): three main zones (residential, industrial, commercial) and how different internal structures have them differently, multi-use zoning vs single-use zoning, 15-min cites

MYP 5

• Rapid-Economic Growth (Economic Miracles) and Poverty (change): Look at Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, China for case studies of various policies that lead to rapid growth—market liberalization, industrial policy, land reforms, etc—and who does and doesn’t benefit from development

• International Migration (global connections): push and pull factors, labor security for migrants workers, migration corridors

• Global Regions and Fact-Based Worldview (time, place, and space): look at the world using binary labels like eastern and western, 1st world and 3rd world, developed and developing—and see where and when those terms came into being—and then compare to composite indicators like HDI and World Bank’s 4 income levels

• Social Syetems (systems): pairing up various social system to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, looking at when systems overlap like early Americans using the religious system to support the slave-based economic system

# The Cloud Isn’t Going Anywhere. Neither Is Your Local Machine. Relax.

Every few years, the tech world collectively decides something is dead. Not “less popular,” not “evolving,” fully dead. Buried. Forgotten. Never to be spoken of again.

First, it was physical servers. Then desktops. Then laptops. Then on-prem. Now, if you’re not “cloud native,” you’re apparently carving YAML into stone tablets and asking interns to rotate tapes.

Here’s the thing, though. After doing this long enough, you start noticing a pattern. The cloud is amazing. Local systems are still useful. Both can exist at the same time. Yes, that means nobody actually “won.”

# Cloud Won for a Reason

Cloud tech didn’t win because of marketing alone. It won because it solved real problems.

It scales. It’s flexible. It lets teams work together without emailing files back and forth like it’s a family photo album from 2003. For startups and distributed teams, it’s borderline magical.

Spin things up. Spin things down. Pay for what you use. Forget where the server physically lives.

Cloud is not a fad. It’s not going anywhere. Anyone saying otherwise is either selling nostalgia or has never received a cloud invoice that made them stare at the screen in silence.

>

# Where the “Everything Must Be Cloud” Idea Gets Weird

Somewhere along the way, enthusiasm turned into doctrine.

Suddenly, every tool needed an account, a subscription, and a login flow longer than the task it was supposed to perform. Want to edit a file. Cool. Please verify your email, accept the updated terms, and confirm you’re not a robot.

Local machines didn’t stop working. They just stopped being fashionable. And as we all know, fashion is a solid foundation for infrastructure decisions.

>

# Local Still Does Real Work, Sorry

If you’ve ever been on a plane, in a coffee shop with WiFi that technically exists, or in a building where the network team insists “nothing changed,” you already understand this.

Work does not politely pause because the cloud is having a moment.

Local tools keep going. Files open. Scripts run. Things get done. No spinner. No outage banner. No friendly status page explaining that the issue is “intermittent but being actively investigated.”

It turns out boring reliability is still extremely useful.

# Performance and Control, the Uncool Stuff

Some workloads are just happier close to the metal. Development environments. Media processing. Security tooling. Data analysis. Anything where latency matters or you don’t want to wait for a round trip across the internet just to hit save.

Then there’s control. Compliance. Cost predictability. Knowing exactly where your data lives.

Not every organization wants everything living in someone else’s data center, no matter how many certifications are listed at the bottom of the homepage. “Trust us” is not a compliance strategy.

# This Was Never a Fight

The mistake is treating this like a showdown. Cloud versus local. New versus old. Future versus dinosaur.

It’s exhausting, and it’s mostly made up.

Hybrid systems exist because reality is messy. Because one size never fits all. Because people use systems in airplanes, basements, secure environments, and places with infrastructure that was “temporarily upgraded” five years ago.

Use the cloud where it makes sense. Use local systems where they make sense. Combine them when that’s the obvious answer. This does not need to be a personality trait.

# The Part You Learn After Enough Time Doing This

The cloud is the future in the same way electricity is the future. You rely on it. You build around it. You expect it to be there.

But you still keep a flashlight. And probably a generator. And maybe a printed copy of the runbook, just in case.

>

After enough years in tech, you stop chasing absolutes. You stop declaring winners. You stop rebuilding perfectly functional systems just to satisfy a trend cycle.

You build things that work when everything is fine, and more importantly, when it isn’t.

That’s not anti-cloud.

That’s just experience talking.

That said, I went out for a coffee this morning and two things struck me - both of which I seem to notice with increasing regularity.

First: groups of people walking shoulder to shoulder, taking up the entire pavement, apparently united by a solemn vow never to acknowledge the existence of anyone coming the other way. No sidestep, no shuffle, not even a vague hint of spatial awareness. Where I’m from, people tend to clock their surroundings and instinctively make a bit of room - often while apologising for existing. Is this just the world now, or am I simply nostalgic for basic pavement etiquette?

Second: cycling groups. Immaculate road bikes, full Tour de France cosplay - ski tight shorts, moisture wicking jerseys, the whole shabbang - looking poised to smash out a 100km ride at any moment. Yet I never actually see them on the roads. Only parked outside coffee shops, carefully arranged for photo sessions. Is this more of a social club with bicycles as props? Because honestly, where in the city would you even want to road cycle here, unless you’ve got a strong appetite for adrenaline and a flexible view of personal safety?

Old dust, pine cleaner, and something sweeter beneath it that I couldn’t place. 

It was the smell of a place that had been waiting without changing, the way houses do when they’ve outlived the people who loved them. 

My dad stood behind me while I fumbled with the lock, his hands folded loosely at his waist, posture relaxed, patient. He looked exactly the same as he always had. Older, yes, grayer at the temples, but intact in a way that felt unfair considering the funeral we’d just buried my mother in.

He hugged me when I stepped inside, firm and warm and entirely convincing. 

I remember thinking, stupidly, that if there were ever signs something had been wrong with him, they would have shown themselves by now. He’d been a good father. Attentive. Creative. He made things with his hands. He remembered birthdays. He read to me when I was little. These were the thoughts I clung to in the early days, before I started remembering the toys.

The house was quieter without my mom. Not emptier—just wrong. Her things were still everywhere, but they’d already begun to feel like props left behind after a play had closed. 

My dad told me to take my time, said I could stay as long as I needed while we sorted things out. He mentioned my old room, said it was mostly untouched. 

When I asked him, casually, if he’d kept any of my toys, he smiled in that familiar, indulgent way and told me they were still in my toy box, same place they’d always been. There was something about the way he said it that lingered with me, though at the time I couldn’t have told you why.

My childhood bedroom looked smaller than I remembered. The posters were gone, the shelves bare except for dust outlines where things used to sit, but the toy box was still there at the foot of the bed. 

I remember hesitating before opening it, not because I was afraid, but because grief has a way of making even neutral memories feel dangerous. 

Inside were the wooden action figures my dad had always made for me. Not store-bought toys, not plastic or soft or colorful, but carefully carved figures with jointed limbs and tiny cloth clothes stitched by hand. Knights, soldiers, travelers, figures that looked like they belonged to some older story. My mom used to say they were charming. I used to agree.

I lifted them out one by one and set them on the floor. They were heavier than I remembered. Each of them had the same strange symbol carved into their chests beneath their clothes, something I’d noticed as a kid but never questioned. 

A triangle, lines drawn from each edge inward, converging into a circle marked with an X. As a child, I’d assumed it was just my dad’s signature, the way artists sign their work. Seeing it again made my stomach tighten for reasons I couldn’t articulate.

My favorite was missing though.

The knight with the javelin had been my constant companion for years. I used to carry him everywhere, even slept with him under my pillow until my mom insisted he’d rip the bed sheets.

I found him eventually, shoved into the back of my closet beneath a pile of old coats. He was different. 

The wooden javelin was driven straight through his chest, embedded deep enough that the point protruded from his back. His hands were still wrapped around the shaft, fingers carved into the shape of desperate grip, angled inward as if he’d done it himself.

I stood there for a long time holding him, waiting for the sense of wrongness to resolve into something manageable. 

I tried to tell myself it was damage, something I’d done as a kid and forgotten, but I knew I hadn’t. The carving was too precise. The force implied by the depth of the wound was impossible. When I pressed my thumb against the wood near the hole, it felt warmer than the rest of him.

That night, I woke to a sound I didn’t recognize at first. Not a crash exactly—more like weight being released all at once. Wood against wood, then against the floor. 

It came from my bedroom, a dense, unified clatter that had no stagger to it, no echoing sequence. Just one moment of impact, as if something had been let go.

I lay still for several seconds, listening for footsteps or my dad’s voice, for any sign that someone else had heard it too. The house remained silent. 

When I finally sat up and turned on the lamp, the light revealed the shelf above my dresser completely bare. Every wooden figure lay on the floor below it, scattered outward in a rough semicircle. 

None of them were stacked or tangled. They hadn’t fallen into each other. They’d landed apart, spaced in a way that felt deliberate, though I couldn’t have explained how.

I picked one up and checked the shelf with my hand, running my fingers along the wood. It wasn’t warped. It wasn’t loose. I pressed down on it harder than necessary, half-expecting it to give or crack or prove my dad right before he’d even said anything. 

It held firm. When I set the figure back upright on the dresser, I noticed something that made my chest tighten: its head was angled slightly upward, not enough to be obvious, but enough that its carved eyes were no longer facing the wall where the shelf had been. They were pointed toward the bed.

I told myself that was coincidence. That gravity, vibration, and my own exhaustion were enough to explain it. I put the rest of the toys back without looking at their faces, turned off the lamp, and lay there until morning with the blanket pulled up to my chin like I was ten years old again. 

Nothing else happened that night. Nothing moved. 

My dad was already up when I came into the kitchen. He stood at the stove in an old T-shirt and slippers, cracking eggs into a pan like he’d done a thousand mornings before. 

The radio played softly on the counter, some local station talking about traffic. For a moment, watching him from the doorway, it was easy to believe the night had been nothing more than a bad dream layered over grief.

“Morning,” he said without turning around. “You sleep okay?”

“Not really,” I said. I sat at the table and rubbed my eyes. “Did you hear anything last night?”

He glanced over his shoulder, eyebrows lifting just a little. “Like what?”

“A noise, it was like the middle of the night, in my room.“

He turned the burner down before answering. 

“House is old, it settles at night. Especially when the temperature drops.”

“All of my toys fell off the shelf.”

That made him pause. Just long enough to notice, but not long enough to feel intentional. He resumed stirring the eggs, scraping the pan with slow, even movements.

“Did they break?”

“No.”

“That’s good, I made them pretty solid.”

I didn’t respond right away. He slid the eggs onto a plate and set it in front of me, along with two slices of toast. He always did that—fed people first.

“They all fell at once,” I said finally.

He sat across from me and took a sip of his coffee. “That happens, weight shifts. Wood expands. Kind of feels like magic, doesn’t it?”

I watched his face as he spoke, looking for something I could point to later and say that’s when it started. There wasn’t anything. He looked tired, sad. Sad, in the way people get after funerals when they’re finally allowed to stop being strong.

“I was thinking about those toys. You kept all of them?”

“Of course I did, why wouldn’t I?”

“I don’t know, just figured maybe some of them got thrown out over the years.”

He shook his head, almost smiling. “You don’t throw things like that away. Not things that still have a reason.”

“What reason?” I asked.

He looked at me then, really looked at me, like he was weighing whether the question deserved an answer. “Memories,” he said after a moment. 

“Some things are worth keeping close. They help you remember what matters.”

I laughed before I could stop myself. It came out wrong, too sharp. “You always did talk like that.”

He smiled back, unbothered. “I’ve always believed you should live with the results of things. Otherwise they don’t mean much.”

I stared down at my plate. The eggs had gone cold.
“Did you move anything in my room? After I went to sleep?”

“No, I didn’t go in there.”

“Are you sure?”

He nodded. “I wouldn’t touch your things without asking. Never have.”

That was true. He’d always been careful about that. Respectful even of his own kids property. It was one of the things I loved about him.

As I stood to take my plate to the sink, he added, casually, “If you’re going through the toy box, try not to mix them up too much. They were all made a certain way.”

I paused with my back to him,“What do you mean?”

“Just that they fit where they fit,” he said. “Things tend to get uncomfortable when they’re moved around too much.”

I waited for him to say more. He didn’t.

He went back to see his coffee, and the radio kept talking about traffic, and for a few seconds everything felt almost normal again. 

It wasn’t until later, when I noticed the same strange symbol carved into the handle of a hammer in his workshop, that I realized how carefully he’d chosen every word.

I tried to be rational about it at first. Grief does strange things to memory, and memory does worse things when given time alone in familiar places. 

Faces blur. Details rearrange themselves to fit narratives you don’t realize you’re building. That’s what I told myself when I picked up the smaller wooden figure again—the one in the plain tunic—and felt that crawling sense of familiarity tighten in my chest.

It wasn’t an exact likeness. My dad hadn’t carved portraits. The faces were simplified, smoothed down to essentials: cheekbones, brow, jaw. But the proportions were right in a way that felt intimate. The slight bend in the nose. The way the mouth slanted downward on one side, as if caught mid-thought. I carried the figure to the window and held it in better light, rotating it slowly, forcing myself to find differences. The more I looked, the fewer I found.

Evan. The neighborhood kid who used to shove me into hedges and steal my bike when I was too small to stop him. He’d gone missing the summer I turned eleven. People said he ran away. His parents moved not long after. I hadn’t thought about him in years.

I put the figure down harder than I meant to and backed away from the shelf. My heart was racing, not with fear exactly, but with the kind of adrenaline that comes when your mind is trying to outrun a conclusion it doesn’t want to reach. 

I spent the rest of the morning avoiding the room. When my dad asked if I wanted to help him sort through the garage, I said yes too quickly.

That was where I noticed the symbol again.

It was carved into the wooden handle of a hammer hanging above the workbench. The same triangle, the same lines drawn inward, converging at that marked circle. It was faint, worn smooth by years of use, but unmistakable. 

I reached out and brushed dust from it with my thumb, and a wave of nausea rolled through me so suddenly I had to grab the bench to stay upright. The world tilted, darkened at the edges, and for a second I was convinced I was going to be sick right there on the concrete floor.

“You okay?” my dad asked from behind me.
I nodded too fast. 

“Yeah. Just… stood up too quick.”

He didn’t press it. He never did. That was another thing I’d always loved about him.

I started noticing the symbol everywhere after that. 

On the handles of garden shears. Etched faintly into the underside of a shelf bracket. Burned into the corner of a cutting board my mom used to keep out on the counter. 

Once I saw it, I couldn’t unsee it. It was consistent every time, precise in a way that ruled out coincidence. I tried to tell myself it was some old maker’s mark, a habit he’d never broken, but the thought didn’t hold. My dad wasn’t sentimental like that. He didn’t repeat himself without reason.

That afternoon, I went back to the toys.

I lined them up on the floor, farther apart this time, giving each one space. There were more of them than I remembered. 

Some I recognized immediately—the knight, the soldier with the cracked helmet, the woman in the long dress whose hands were carved folded in front of her chest. 

Others felt unfamiliar in a way that bothered me more. People I didn’t remember, but somehow knew.

The businessman was the worst.

He wore a carved suit jacket with real buttons sewn into it, tiny and functional. His hair was neatly parted, his posture rigid. 

When I lifted him, I noticed the faint indentation around his neck, like a collar pressed too tight for too long. I knew who he was before I let myself say it. 

My dad’s former boss. 

The man who used to come over for dinner sometimes, who laughed too loudly and never remembered my name. He’d been found dead in his office years ago. Heart attack, they said. Stress.

I dropped the figure and backed away until I hit the bed.

The pattern was impossible to ignore now. Every face I could place belonged to someone who had wronged my father in some small or significant way. 

A contractor who’d overcharged him and scammed him because he was the only contractor in the area. A neighbor who’d threatened to sue over a property line. People who had disappeared, died suddenly, or simply stopped being talked about. People who had, until now, only existed as half-remembered stories.

That night, I took the knight down from the shelf again.

I don’t know why I chose him. Maybe because he’d always been my favorite. Maybe because the spear through his chest felt like an accusation I couldn’t answer. 

I sat on the edge of the bed and turned him over in my hands, tracing the carving marks, the tiny imperfections left by my dad’s tools. The symbol was there beneath his tunic, deeper than on the others, the lines pressed so hard they’d split the grain.

On impulse, I lifted the knight’s head and pressed his mouth to my ear.

At first, there was nothing. Just the faint smell of old wood and dust. Then, so quietly I almost missed it, I heard something that might have been breath. A sound too soft to be sound, more like pressure. I held still, afraid that even the act of listening might make it stop. The noise shifted, tightened, and then I understood what it was.

Screaming.

Not loud. Not clear. Muffled and distant, like it was coming from the bottom of a well. Pain stretched thin and folded in on itself, endless and trapped. 

My hands started shaking so badly I almost dropped him. When I pulled him away, the sound stopped instantly, leaving the room unbearably silent.

I put the knight back where I’d found him and didn’t touch the toys again.

Later, at dinner, my dad asked me if I’d slept any better. I told him I had. He nodded, satisfied, and went back to eating like nothing in the world had changed. 

I watched him chew, watched the steady rise and fall of his chest, and wondered how many people were still screaming in the quiet spaces of this house.

That night, I dreamed of wood splitting under pressure, of hands clawing at the inside of something that would never open.

I didn’t go looking for anything else. I want that to be clear. I wasn’t brave enough for that, or noble, or driven by any sense of obligation to the people I’d come to understand were trapped in my childhood toys. 

What I was, more than anything, was unable to sit still with what I knew. Once you accept a truth like that, even partially, the world rearranges itself around it. Every familiar thing becomes suspect. Every quiet moment stretches too long.

The house had a way of guiding me without asking. I’d find myself standing in doorways I didn’t remember walking to, staring at corners I’d passed a thousand times without noticing. 

The backyard was one of those places. I hadn’t been out there since I arrived, not really. It was late afternoon when I stepped outside, the light thin and pale, the grass dry from weeks without rain.

The far edge of the yard sloped gently downward toward a line of trees. There was nothing remarkable about it. No shed, no fence, no marker of any kind. Just a stretch of ground my dad kept meticulously neat, even now. 

I don’t know what made me walk that way. Maybe it was the way the sod looked slightly newer there, greener in a patch that didn’t match the rest. Maybe it was just the accumulated weight of everything else.

I knelt and brushed my hand over the grass. The soil beneath felt firmer than it should have. When I pushed harder, my fingers struck something solid.


The trap door was almost invisible. A square of concrete fitted so tightly into the ground it looked like part of the earth itself. 

It took real effort to lift it, my fingers slipping against the edge until I managed to wedge them underneath. As the door swung open, a smell rose up to meet me—cold, mineral, and layered with something darker beneath it. I gagged and had to turn my head away.

A narrow set of steps led down into a small concrete room. No lights. No windows. Just a single object at the center of the space.

The altar was made of ebony wood, polished to a dull sheen that absorbed light rather than reflecting it. 

It was scarred with cuts and burns, its surface pitted in places like it had been worked over again and again. 

Around it lay remnants I didn’t want to catalog but did anyway: clumps of hair caught in the corners, gray ash ground into the concrete, scraps of leather stiff with age, thread tangled and knotted like something abandoned mid-task. 

There were stains too, dark and uneven, soaked deep enough into the floor that no amount of scrubbing could have removed them.

I stepped inside despite every instinct screaming at me not to.

The symbol was carved into the altar’s surface, larger and deeper than anywhere else I’d seen it. Dust filled the grooves, softening the lines. 

I crouched and brushed it away with shaking hands, revealing the triangle, the converging lines, the marked circle at the center. 

The moment the last of the dust cleared, my stomach lurched violently. Pain bloomed behind my eyes, sharp and disorienting, and the room seemed to fold inward on itself.

I remember thinking, that this must be what severe vertigo feels like.

Then I was on the floor.

The concrete was cold against my cheek. My mouth tasted like metal. For a few seconds—maybe longer—I couldn’t tell if I’d lost consciousness or if time had simply skipped. 

When I pushed myself up, my hands came away damp with sweat. My heart was hammering so hard I could see my pulse in my wrists.

Nothing else had happened. No voices. No visions. No answers. Just a body reacting to something my mind couldn’t comprehend.

I closed the trap door and replaced the sod as carefully as I could, like a child trying to erase evidence of a mistake. When I went back inside, my dad was in the living room watching television. He looked up and smiled.

“You disappear on me?”

“Just needed some air,” 

He nodded, accepting it without question. “Dinner’s in an hour.”

That night, I lay awake listening to the house. Not for footsteps or movement, but for the absence of it. 

The toys didn’t fall again. Nothing shifted. The silence was complete, and in that silence, I understood something that hurt worse than fear.
He was never going to explain it.

There would be no confession, no confrontation, no moment where I could demand names or reasons or mercy. 

Whatever he had done, whatever rules governed it, he had folded it so completely into the fabric of his life that it had become invisible to him. 

He loved me. I believe that. He loved me enough to keep me separate from it, to give me toys instead of truth, to let me grow up surrounded by suffering I was never meant to recognize.

In the morning, I packed my things.

My dad helped me load the car, moving carefully, deliberately, the way he always did. 

When I hugged him goodbye, his arms were steady around me. Solid. Human. He told me to drive safe. He told me to call when I got home. He stood in the driveway and waved until I was out of sight.

I didn’t take any of the toys with me.

I think about them often now, lined up on shelves and in boxes, waiting in a house that still smells faintly of pine cleaner and dust. 

I think about the people they used to be, about the pain of existing inside something that cannot die. I think about the knight most of all, and how he must have realized what he was long before I did and had tried to do something about it.

Sometimes I wonder if leaving them behind was a mercy.

Sometimes I wonder if it was just another way of pretending I didn’t know.",5,1765775577.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1pmz8n3,https://www.reddit.com/r/RWShelp/comments/1pmz8n3/create_task_tips_auditor_perspective/,Create task tips( auditor perspective),"Hi guys, I just thought I should share some tips on Create tasks that will help you get at least a good rating (from an auditor’s perspective).

There were auditing guidelines that were uploaded, and honestly, they’re so strict that it’s easy to get your submission rated badly. Reasons include things like: submission shows less effort, submission just meets basic requirements, the result is not creative, submission is acceptable but not impressive, etc.

As you can see, the reasons mentioned above are quite subjective, and an auditor can just decide, “nah, this is not impressive,” and rate you badly just like that. The tips below will at least help ensure that if your submission is rated by an auditor who is not too fussy, it will be given a good rating.

1.Please make sure that your submission has a conversation with at least 2 exchanges between the user and the assistant. I know in the tutorial the guy didn’t mention it, but in the QA guidelines they gave examples, showed bad and fine ratings for such submissions, and gave the reason: the submission has only 1 exchange between the user and the assistant.

2.If there are audios in your videos, always make sure you mention it in your instructions.

3.Describe what we should see in the generated media clearly in the prompt.

4.Do not unnecessarily crop videos or images. If you do crop, make sure you do it properly.

5.Never send the assistant response under the user. Please double-check your work before you submit; I know it’s pretty easy to make a mistake on this.

6.Do not forget to put a user instruction before the assistant response.

7.User instructions are supposed to tell us what the assistant should generate. Do not ask a question and then immediately answer it yourself. Please guys, I’ve audited so many tasks where the user instruction makes no sense. They ask a question and then answer themselves.
e.g.
User: Why is the guy making coffee?
Assistant: Because it’s morning and he likes coffee.

Then after submitting this, they add a picture or video of the guy holding a cup of coffee as the assistant response. This is incorrect, guys.

8.Lastly, try to be creative. It’s not always easy to be creative, but if you can, please do it. For example, you can at least make the conversation interesting to follow.
e.g.
User: Hey, please create a video with the picture I sent above, showing the girl waving slowly while staring directly at the camera with a big, contagious smile.
Assistant: Generates the video.

User: Wow, impressive, I like it a lot. Now please continue generating and show the girl walking from where she was standing toward the camera.
Assistant: Generates the video.

User: Thanks a lot, I appreciate it. Now one last thing, please combine all the clips and add some calm, scene-appropriate audio that corresponds well with the generated video.
Assistant: Generates the video.

Guys, this is just my off-the-head random example. It’s not that creative, but maybe at least exciting to follow through the conversation.",10,1765775523.0,RWShelp,4,1.0,False

My startup idea is a bit weird!

Hi, I'm a student and currently in 3rd year of undergrad. So here is the problem especially with women. Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes', I wanted to see real people experiences . Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question. Yes I can ask chat gpt, but for safety real people experience matter more I suppose. People post these experience but they are lost in communities.

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a  just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

[Safe or Not](https://www.safeornot.space/community)

You can search for 'Bangkok' or 'Vietnam' or any place you like

1pmz5g5,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pmz5g5/sfthe_schrödinger_box/,[SF]The Schrödinger Box,"And he said to the negotiator:

“If it’s true that you can do anything… create something so heavy that not even you yourself can carry it.”

“Done.”

The negotiator created a box.

“I don’t understand.”

“The object you asked for is inside.”

“And since you can’t carry it, that means you’re not omnipotent. I won the challenge, and now you owe me a wish!”

“That’s why it’s inside the box. In addition to the object, there’s an unstable cesium atom connected to a sensor that controls the engine of reality. While the object remains inside the box, I can carry it and I cannot carry it at the same time.”

“Son of a bitch! A Schrödinger box!”

“I’m leaving… but I’ll give you the box. You’ll see—it’s better than any wish.”

The negotiator left with a malicious smile that Daniel didn’t see, too busy thinking about the possible applications of the object now in his possession.

First, he tossed a coin into the air and caught it inside the box. The instant he closed it, he felt his vision split. His mind clouded for a moment as it processed two different realities simultaneously. He wondered whether he could handle it.

In the first reality, after work he decided to go to a gathering with his coworkers, where they played poker. He was on a streak, won a few dollars, and had a great time. They had invited a guy he didn’t know, and they got along really well. They shared the same dumb tastes and the same aversion to their friends’ politically incorrect comments. They agreed to play Halo together later.

In the second reality, he declined the outing and spent the evening alone at home playing video games and eating instant soup. On top of that, the store only had the brand he didn’t like. Still, it was better than not eating at all.

In the first reality, he went to bed happy, with the taste of beer in his mouth—maybe a little dizzy too.

In the second, he went to bed frustrated (he lost every match and was told he played like a bot) and slightly sick of the vinegar taste of the sauce he’d used to make the soup less awful.

When he woke up, curiosity was killing him. Had the coin landed heads or tails? In both realities, he opened the box, and instantly felt both collapse into one, his perception returning to singularity.

“Which reality did I end up in? I hope it’s the one where I met Josh—I really liked that guy.”

When he got to the office, he found out his friends had been fired. Someone had reported their inappropriate comments from the night before to HR.

“Shit… I hope I ended up in the other reality, or my buddies are going to think I was the one who reported them.”

A burp tasting of soup and vinegar gave him the answer. He had stayed in the reality where he hadn’t gone to the gathering—but apparently it had been the best possible outcome.

The box worked. But it seemed he couldn’t choose which reality it would collapse into once opened. Was there some way to manipulate the outcome?

The next day, he ran the experiment again.

Both realities developed the same way until he passed by the café where he always saw the girl he thought was cute, working on her laptop.

He hesitated about talking to her. After all, the humiliation of possible rejection would disappear if he collapsed into the right reality. But he thought of a third possibility.

In one reality, instead of getting his coffee, he went up and greeted her. She was very focused on what she was doing and got annoyed by the distraction. She asked him to leave her alone. Total rejection.

In the other reality, he bought his coffee and didn’t even approach her. He kept the cup until the end of the day.

Once again, everything converged when he opened the box in both realities. The empty coffee cup was still in his possession.

“Good. I stayed in the reality I wanted this time. Now I know exactly how I’m going to take advantage of this thing.”

The next day, instead of a coin, he tossed a four-sided die into the box (there had to be some advantage to that old D&D obsession).

Managing four realities was much harder than managing two—but it was necessary for the next experiment.

He lived through the four realities the same way for a while, but only in one of them did he buy his cup of coffee. He kept the cup until the end of the day.

When he got home, he opened the box in each of his four realities. Just as he’d expected, he didn’t have the cup this time.

“Excellent. It’s just a matter of manipulating probabilities. I’m a fucking genius.”

A 25% chance of ending up in an unwanted reality was still too risky, so the next day he used a six-sided die. Processing six realities was like having Spotify, YouTube, Twitch, TikTok, X, and his favorite game open at the same time. A normal night at the PC. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Each day he repeated the experiment with a larger die. But when he reached twelve sides, he collapsed momentarily from sensory overload. Somehow, he managed to open the box seconds later.

His head hurt, and he couldn’t move for a few minutes.

“The human mind can only handle ten simultaneous realities. I think a 10% chance of a bad outcome isn’t so bad. After all, as a kid I never won one of those prizes that supposedly came in potato chip bags. They claimed one in ten was a winner. Not bad at all.”

The next day, he tossed a ten-sided die into the box.

He was going to try a new approach with the girl at the café. In all ten realities, he bought a coffee—but in only one did he leave it next to her laptop while saying, “Enjoy.” She looked up at him with an expression completely different from the last time.

“Oh no! How could you?”

“I always see you here, really focused, but I never see you drinking coffee.”

“I usually order it later. How much do I owe you?”

“It’s on me. The payment is having this little chat.”

“Are you sure? Well then—what’s your name?”

“Daniel. And you?”

“Sandra. Nice to meet you.”

“The pleasure’s mine. That sticker on your laptop is awesome.”

“Wait, you like that band?”

“Pff, obviously.”

The conversation went on and on. It flowed naturally and pleasantly. They talked and laughed, and ended up exchanging Instagram accounts to keep chatting later.

The coffee approach had worked. Now all that remained was to collapse realities and repeat everything the next day.

When he woke up the next morning, he ignored the box and the dice. He went straight to the café to interact with Sandra again.

He left the cup, and she reacted the same way as the day before. But he didn’t. He felt forced to respond in certain ways and to laugh at jokes they had already shared the day before.

And she noticed.

“You don’t like me, do you? You’re spaced out, and your laugh sounds fake as hell.”

“It’s not that, Sandra… I really liked you, honestly. I just don’t know how to explain it—it’s like I’ve already lived this. And I mean that in a good way…”

“Like destiny and that bullshit? Or are you from the future?”

They laughed, and this time he did it genuinely.

“No… well, yes… kind of… The point is, I’d love to keep talking. Can I get your Insta?”

“Did I give it to you in the future?”

“In the future, we’re besties.”

They laughed again.

“Let’s see if that’s true.”

Somehow, he had saved the moment and gotten her Instagram again.

But something bothered him. It was very hard to repeat interactions with people exactly. Beating probability didn’t guarantee anything. Because of that, he decided to keep the box stored away. If things didn’t flow well, he preferred them to be natural.

His conversations with Sandra flowed smoothly, and little by little they became good friends. And although Daniel never dared to ask her to be his girlfriend, their relationship gradually transformed until the day they finally held hands and kissed beneath the cherry tree in the Japanese garden where they liked to go for ice cream.

A few years later, they began living together, and the happiest stage of Daniel’s life began. Sandra’s presence pushed him to be better and to improve himself, and thanks to her constant encouragement he landed a better position at work (without having to lick the boots of the snitch from the meeting he never attended, who now also held a good position at the company). He, in turn, pushed Sandra to grow—when she doubted whether to go freelance, he encouraged her, and she managed to open her own firm.

Life couldn’t be better.

But sometimes something unsettled him. Things happened exactly as he remembered them before they occurred. Other times, something was slightly off: keys in places he swore he hadn’t left them, glasses he was sure he’d washed dirty again in the sink, people who didn’t remember anecdotes they’d shared together. At first, he chalked it up to inattention—his own and everyone else’s.

But one day, while they were preparing to move into a larger house, Sandra brought him a sealed box.

“What’s this, babe? I found it at the back of your closet. Can I see what’s inside?”

Daniel understood everything.

“No! Don’t open it!”

“What’s wrong with you? You hiding souvenirs from your other girl in there?” Sandra said, very confused, but in a playful tone more than an accusatory one.

“No, I’m sorry… But don’t open it. Someday I’ll tell you what’s inside. Just not today.”

“Okay, calm down… I won’t mess with your privacy. But it better be worth all the secrecy.”

Daniel devised a plan as fast as he could. Apparently, one of his selves had never closed the box. But so much time had passed that he couldn’t know which one. And his probability trick meant that the current reality was the least likely one if that last box collapsed the outcome of the past several years.

Daniel focused and let himself be carried by the sensations of disconnection he’d felt in recent days. He felt his consciousness split, his vision dividing in two. In one of the realities, he found himself in a wheelchair, somehow getting ready for work—the same job he’d had years earlier.

In this reality, he could sense the bitterness of his own thoughts. He remembered waking up in a hospital years ago; he had remained in a vegetative state for several months. When he woke up, he didn’t remember what had happened—until now, when his mind from the other reality accessed his consciousness.

In that instant, clarity struck: “The box. The damn box!”

It was as if he suddenly remembered something he’d always known. However, he didn’t have full control over his self in that parallel reality, nor vice versa.

And he thought, “If I open that box, there’s a chance it’ll collapse into a reality where I don’t end up like this.”

He called his mother and asked what she had done with the things from his apartment. She told him everything was in a small storage unit near the airport.

Daniel could do nothing now that his other self—Daniel 2—knew what he had to do to free himself from that bond. Obviously, he didn’t want the universe he’d been living in for the past several years to end, but there was no way to stop it.

He couldn’t influence the decisions of his self in the universe where he couldn’t walk, and that self couldn’t influence the decisions of his current self. And yet, he could see everything.

He did everything he could to disconnect from that reality. He knew stopping it was inevitable, but he didn’t want to know the exact moment when everything would go to hell. He tried to disconnect from the double vision, but it was no longer possible. He had been living in alternate universes all this time and had been blind to one of them. It was like realizing something that had always been there and being unable to unsee it—like your own nose.

Coincidentally, he decided to look for the box in his own reality and tell Sandra everything. Naturally, Sandra didn’t believe him—until they tossed a coin into the air and caught it together inside the box, after closing it. Sandra believed everything and cried like someone who knows their partner is going to die from an incurable disease.

Sandra asked him the same thing every day: “How close is Daniel 2 to the box?”

And Daniel simply paid attention and realized that for the other, accessing the box hadn’t been easy. There had been administrative issues, and access to the storage unit was restricted until they were resolved.

He never imagined that the tedium of bureaucracy would be what kept his life balanced on the edge of probabilistic erasure. He enjoyed this life as much as he could.

And finally, the day came when Daniel 2 was able to open the box.

Daniel felt his consciousness slam inward and wished with all his strength that the realities would collapse into the one where he was with Sandra—while he felt Daniel 2 wishing just as desperately for any reality other than the one he was living in.

Before passing out from the horrible headache that had begun to set in, he looked inside the box: it was a twelve-sided die, showing the number one.",1,1765775221.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Am I delusional for keeping this door half cracked open in my mind?,"I am a female in my mid thirties. I started a new job last year and met “C”, a male in his mid twenties (yes, a ten year age gap…) when I was in the break room getting coffee on my first day of work. I was sexually assaulted over a decade ago. I’m not asexual, but i am very protective of myself around men. I introduced myself to C and - this is bizarre to say - I felt an immediate “happy, safe click” almost unlike anything i have ever experienced before in my life. I knew immediately if I engaged with him socially i would develop feelings for him so i avoided him as much as possible for about 10 months.

We work for a huge company in completely unrelated departments with zero overlap. I NEVER looked at C after that and always avoided his eye contact but had a reputation of being very social with my own department. Every time C walked into a room, he would always say hi to me, and I gave baseline friendliness back, but never really engaged. Looking at him made me feeling like I was giving something away, a part of myself I didn’t want to show.

Eventually I started to chat with him a bit, and I slowly realized he was indeed a very sweet guy. And funny. And we bantered.

One day C made the odd comment: “Wow! You look…. Tired!” And I jokingly said: “Well is that all you were going to say?” He replied back: “If I was going to say more, I would have said it yesterday!”

The only time I had encountered him the previous day our interaction had been completely normal on the surface, but I hadn’t looked at him or chatted as much. We always were scheduled to work at the same time roughly, and I started timing my coffee breaks with his. We’d both get coffee together every morning. I usually arrived maybe 10 minutes before he did naturally, I’d just wait until he came in to get my coffee. This sounds creepy, and I’m sure he was wise to the fact that I was waiting for him, yet he kept showing up and getting coffee at the same time and he hardly seemed uncomfortable. He seemed fond of me and a friendly dynamic emerged. Though it was mostly surface level.

I was so tuned into this guy and everything felt so charged. I thought this was all one sided. Then I noticed that he was noticing small things about me too. He remembered my exact phrasing, noted sort of throwaway details (one day I told him my birthday had been “interesting” but our conversation was cut off - and later he brought up that I had used that word even after i forgot I said that.)

It’s safe to say at minimum there was a warm, friendly, maybe borderline flirtiness between us. I always felt an elephant in the room. He joked about chivalrous to me, etc. Then he got promoted to take another job at our company in another state.

On our last day getting coffee (hah, the last day I met him there) he said “I knew you’d be here.” We clinked cups. Our goodbye was clean enough and I told him “IF YOU ever want to, you can reach out and let me know how it all turns out…. IF YOU.” Before that he had said “Well who knows, maybe you’d like (name of city he is moving to that happens to be our company headquarters).”

I’m not going to reach out to this guy. Obviously. I am doing fine and have missed him a little in the couple of weeks he has been gone, but I wonder if there is any reason to have hope he will contact me again. I was thrown by the “maybe you’d like _____” comment. It seemed like a soft “Maybe we could meet again someday” remark.

I sound like I’m 15 🙃 I do wish him the best. I just cannot stress how safe this guy made me feel. My body rejects the presence of so many men. This was an odd experience.

Guys, what do you make of all of this? I know you have only heard my side of things. I know I just need to live my life. To clarify, this guy was single the entire time although I think he went on a few casual dates. Our conversations were mostly surface level yet oddly charged.",2,1765775165.0,AskMenRelationships,2,1.0,False

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/bpGJ3BN200): **November 23, 2025**

Apologies in advance if this post seems disorganized, my head is still reeling from all this. 9 years ago (I was 18 then) my older sister eloped with her then boyfriend. Our parents (we're an immigrant family) were vehemently opposed to her relationship, I remember me being ok with it personally, it wasn't my place. She eloped with her boyfriend and cut of all contact with us. My parents were besides themselves. I tried reaching out to her back then on different platforms but was blocked. I even reached out to her best friends and asked them if they could at least get me in touch with her, they said she didn't know where she lived now, but that she'd told them she was happy. She had also left her workplace. Eventually we all (me and my parents) came to like an unspoken agreement to pretend she was never here, and I blocked her everywhere too. I remember being extra particular to call regularly when I was in college because I was worried about their state of mind. We're now at a place where I can't remember the last time she crossed our minds.

Yesterday my sister knocked on my apartment door. She cried and hugged me when she saw me, I hugged her back initially too, I wasn't really thinking at the time. She was just going on about how much I had changed, how much she'd missed me all these years. Eventually I kind of remembered everything, and asked her why she was here, and who had given her my address. She said she had swore to them that she wouldnt tell. I asked her why didn't she call first since whoever gave my address probably gave my number too, she said she just wanted to see me in person. I told her we'd gotten over her, why was she here. She said her issue had only been with our parents, not me, I told her about how I'd been blocked too by her when she left. She told me she was sorry she'd hurt me, but she had wanted a fresh start, told me I was an uncle to a nephew and a niece (they weren't there at the time, they were at their father's, they recently divorced). She acted surprised that I wouldn't know, said she'd told someone to tell our parents about them.

Maybe it was hearing about the divorce that frustrated me more, because if we were going to have gone through all this pain, at least she could've found lasting happiness, I just told her she was a stranger to me now. She said we could have lunch together she wanted to know all about what I'd been up to, I told her it was best if we continued to have no contact, she didn't act like an older sister when I needed her to, and that we were no longer family, we'd mourned her already and we were now strangers. She was tearful, she gave me her address and phone number and left.

Last night, I spoke to my girlfriend about what had happened. She said she was still my sister, that I shouldn't have just turned her away. I told her she didn’t know what we'd gone through in the days after she had eloped. But I still wanted to know here AITA?

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** What are your parents thoughts ? How do they feel about potential reconciliation?

> **OOP:** I haven't told them about this. I don’t see the point I guess, they made their peace with her absence a while back, we all did.

**Commenter 2:** What is it that you want to achieve? This is crucial to answering the question. 

> **OOP:** I don’t know. I really had internalized that I'd never see her again. I remember the hurt I had felt at the time. I don’t want to lose my headspace and I don't want to act like everything I went through was ok, that it shouldn't have any meaning or consequences. And of course I want her and her kids to be safe and happy too.

**Commenter 3:** Did she even apologise? Or did she do the classic, it's such a long time ago you should be over it by now move? If there's no sincerity, there's no trust that she won't ghost you again. She owes you a full and frank conversation about what happened, her actions, her motivations and why she continued to block you. Without that you really have nothing to work with. Good luck.

> **OOP:** She did apologize, she said she was sorry that she had cut me off, that she never meant for us to lose touch, her beef was with our parents only. I brought up that she blocked me everywhere, and she was just sobbing and apologizing. I also remember me begging her best friends for info and them saying they had no idea, which Ive always suspected was them lying because she asked them to.

**Commenter 4:** NTA. She broke all contact with you for nearly a decade. She treated you as if you were disposable. There is no relationship to salvage. She doesn’t get to unilaterally decide to pick you up again just because it works for her.

I’m guessing she’s decided now’s a good time because she’s getting divorced and in essence needs something (time, attention, connection) from you. Ask yourself, if she weren’t getting divorced, would she have reached out?

You need to figure out who shared your address with her.

> **OOP:** I hadn’t thought of this and I've been feeling sick thinking this might be true since I read this. That she wouldn't have ever reached out if she hadn’t gotten divorced. Would've been fine without ever seeing me again. Although she didn't ask for anything material during our interaction I guess, she wanted lunch, she thought after 9 years of almost forgetting I had a sister, id be ok with lunch.

**Commenter 5:** OP, I wonder if her bf turned husband made her block you all? Could it be that getting away from him might be why she was able to reach out?

> **OOP:** I don’t know. Back then she would vouch for him a lot in front of our parents who really thought he was bad news, so idk, she seemed like it was all of her own volition.

**Commenter 6:** Absolutely NTA. When will people start accepting the consequences to their actions? And why do other people think they can tell you how you should have responded to her?? Your girlfriend should have kept her mouth shut and just held you and let you talk and been there for you. I wouldn’t tell your parents you saw her either. That’s a bandaid you don’t want to rip off.

> **OOP:** I won’t be telling my parents. If she reached out to me, she can reach out to them the same way, though she told me she won’t be doing it, she'd only reached out to me.

**Commenter 7:** NTA but that's a tough situation to be in 

Just out of curiosity, why didn’t the family accept her then bf? Cultural? Religious? Age?

> **OOP:** They just didn't think he would make a good partner I think, she'd be vouching for him, and they (particularly my mom) would be telling her that essentially he's only interested in sex to put it crudely. There may have been other subconscious reasons possibly idk, but at least when they talked about it they would only bring up that he was bad news and that they were looking out for her.

**Downvoted Commenter:** Keep in mind that she might have cut you off because she was scared you would tell your parents anything that she told you.

> **OOP:** No. We had covered for each other so often when I was young. She had covered for me too. There was stuff that I could only tell her. That could not have been a real fear. I'd even told her friends that I wouldn't tell our parents but at least ask her to meet up with me. I'm sorry if I sound pointed but I haven't had to remember all the bs I went through in the aftermath of her elopement in a while and its just crazy how she just ditched us all. I don't think I can see her, I'd been thinking about it, but meeting her just means everything she put us through was fine, I remember how I felt at that time, and I can't let it go.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/zH7yp3nXaF): **November 27, 2025 (four days later)**

Hi. Thanks a lot to everyone for the support in my post. And to those who reached out for support. I'd been emotionally drained almost after meeting my sister. Like I said I had made my peace, after a lot of hurt and futile hope, that I would never see her again.

She had my number, and I hadn't blocked the new number of hers. I'd thought about it, and received advice to, but I just didn't, it slipped from my mind. She asked me on Tuesday how I was doing, and asked if we could meet on Wednesday, she really wanted me to meet her kids. I was really conflicted, I didn't want to oblige her, but I decided to say yes to at least meet them.

I went to her apartment yesterday and met my niece and nephew. My niece had recently turned 9 and my nephew is 6. They're great kids and I really enjoyed seeing them. I remember feeling a certain way when my sister was introducing me and she told him, that the way he's my niece's younger brother, similarly I'm her younger brother. We talked a bit, and started talking about stories from us growing up. I hadn’t and still haven't said everything's ok between us, but our stories and conversation went smoothly. I learned that after she eloped and got married she had moved in with her husband into his place in a town a few hours away from us. That around 2019 they had had moved to the city we were currently in (according to her she didn't know all this time that I later moved here for work after college too). I told her about what I'd been up to all these years, my college, my job, my girlfriend etc.

After that, the kids were in their room and my sister brought up us all doing something again over the weekend. I told her we weren’t ok, she can't expect me to forget everything. She said she was sorry that her moving out had nothing to do with me, that she missed me. I was angry at the fact that she had no idea the pain I'd gone through both personally and then having to be the crutch for my parents pain. I told her I didn't believe her that she would've been perfectly fine with never seeing me again if she hadn’t gotten divorced, that I could've been dead and she probably wouldn’t have broken a sweat upon learning it since she was so blissed out from her domestic life. I know it was ugly, I've never said anything like this but in that moment I just wanted her to feel some kind of hurt of the kind she'd given me. She broke down and said I can hate her if I want but to just not hate her forever, there has to be a limit. I regretted saying what I said when I saw her crying so I just sat next to her and asked about why they'd divorced.

She told me that their life had been going alright the first few years. She said she'd even sent word through a mutual when the kids were born (which either the mutual messed up or my sister did because we never heard about it). She said when covid happened her marriage became hell for her, that it had uncovered a side of her ex she never knew. He became abusive, had disdain for their son, revealed he used to record every single conversation of theirs, had convinced her she was crazy and a bad wife and mother. That she stuck with him because of the kids until she had enough, that a very good neighbor of theirs whom she had become friends with gave her a lot of support and even helped line her up with a job. During all this she even blamed our parents for her sticking with the marriage for so long and for not reaching out. I told her they had literally pleaded with her not to do this, I was there, I was 18 not 8. She said they told her she was dead to them if she ran off with him and so she blamed them for her not being able to leave him. I told her that was insane logic and she just didn’t want to talk about them and asked me not to tell them about her. I said yeah her relationship with them is her own.

I also asked her who had given her my address, she begged me not to ask her that, that they hadn’t given it easily she'd had to swear secrecy, and cry and convince them that I'd want to see my older sister, so I dropped it.

We had tea and snacks after that she asked me again if I wanted to do anything this weekend since she has the kids or we could do something the weekend after just the two of us, I said I don't know. She was ok with that answer. She was tearful again when I was leaving, we hugged and I hugged the kids goodbye too.

My mind has been a mess since then. I lashed out and everything, but also regret what I said, but then I also try to remember how I had felt back then and then get angry again. It feels so weird knowing that shes now 20 minutes away from me and we can visit whenever. I told my girlfriend about all this, she said she supports me no matter what but in her opinion to consider the weekend plan with a cool mind.

This got long, I apologize but Ive been trying to collect my own thoughts on this and writing this just seemed to help. Thanks for the help.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter:** I'm glad you and your sister talked? I'm late to the party, but I was in a similar boat recently.... and my sister is now married to a woman. So, good luck OP!

That's a great moment to... just be at least hear out one another? on what's happened, one another's view that doesn't mean you're forced to do anything, but at least you have the ability to decide if this is something you could pursue.

My sister came from a DV relationship, and so did I... the fact that we're both still alive and able to talk about our shitty parents is a huge support beam in my system. She is still recovering, and so am I. But we have one another, and she had her awesome wife!

Just, take some time off the internet and enjoy a day where you relax, go out for a nice coffee and lunch, maybe to the park, all on your own and just think. Allow yourself to cry in your car, talk to yourself, a you day with selfcare, or maybe a day in cuddled up warm pillows, creating/drawing, but I really recommend getting out of the house off the internet. Dopamine media detox for a day basically, and let yourself feel, and think.

> **OOP:** I’m going to try and clear my mind thanks. I've been thinking this again and again that I should do what makes me happy, and maybe that is being able to reconnect with her and her kids and then I think that's letting her off too easy, I was in pain back then trying to reach out, what about that. Its been emotionally taxing. Your advice about taking some tine off is good.

#----NEW UPDATE----

**Editor’s note: OOP made the latest update into the same update post**

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/zH7yp3nXaF): **December 8, 2025 (11 days later)**

**Update:** Hi, I’d been getting a lot of moral support and advice from a lot of people here which I appreciate. A few people had asked how things have gone. So I told my sister I couldn’t sped thanksgiving weekend with her. Partly because maybe I still wasn’t in the right headspace for something like that and also because I had t go to my parents for that weekend, and normally when I go there I usually end up staying over for the entire weekend. She said ok, asked me not to tell them that she was back in my life, i said fine, it wasn’t my place and besides my parents had come to terms with her absence a while back.

It was a bit surreal for sure to be with my parents and have this secret with me. We were spending the weekend like a complete family while my sister was at her apartment and knowing this was weird. When I was back she asked if I wanted to hang out next weekend (the one that just passed), her kids would be with their dad so the two of us could hang out.

I know what a lot of commenters had said. I appreciate all their advice. But I had tried to clear my head and my girlfriend had just told me to do whatever makes me happy. I did think about it, and I honestly decided that hanging out with her on Saturday would make me happier than not doing it. It wasn’t about her, it was for myself, so I went to her apartment on Saturday.

She asked me how our parents were doing I said they were doing well now. Since she was the one who mentioned them I asked her if she wanted to reconnect with them, it might be better for both her and maybe them, but she said no, and just repeated that line about them saying she was dead to them. It was clearly something said in the heat of the moment but I didn’t push her on it again. We just went to the mall, bought some clothes, then had dinner at her place and watched a movie. It was a light hangout in general, the conversation flowed smoothly. It obviously wasn't like it used to be, partly because I still keep thinking about how I felt when she had left us, about how I had to support our parents emotionally in the aftermath and partly because she has changed a bit, shes a lot more anxious and nervous now than I remember her. But in general it was a chill hangout.

I did bring up that I’d like to know who gave her my address that at this point I didn’t regret that they had given it to her but still they shouldn’t do that. She got defensive and begged me not to ask her that, that they hadn’t just given it easily, she’d had to plead and cry and promise that she’d take a rejection if that’s what I did, and that she’d sworn secrecy. So again I dropped it, its whatever I guess. I left and we said we’ll meet up again soon.

I had received a lot of comments saying I was stupid, that I had no self-esteem that I was being used. I just would like you to understand that this isn’t an abstract concept for me like it might be for you. This is my sister. The same sister who i grew up with, who helped me with school projects and helped me out in a ton of ways when I was growing up. And yes the same sister who ghosted us for 9 years. I’m still angry about that, but like I said I’m only doing what I want for myself, not out of some guilt now. And look so far I’m down a subway fare’s worth of dollars to visit her and a few hours at the mall, I’m fine with that loss. If after all this she ups and ghosts me again in the future for whatever reason, I’ve made my peace with that, and may we all get what we deserve in that case. Thank you for all the help.

I just want an app that helps me keep my sanity. Does this exist?,"Hey everyone I'm a FTM, and I have downloaded about 5 different pregnancy apps. They are all great at telling me the physical stuff—weight, size, kicks—but I feel like they completely ignore the mental and emotional side of this journey.

I feel like I’m missing something massive, and I wanted to ask this community if there is an app out there that actually solves the real struggles I'm facing right now?

Honestly, I don’t need another fruit comparison. I need help with these three things that are actually keeping me up at night:
1. The Isolation is Real (and weirdly specific):
I have friends, but none of them are pregnant right now. They try to understand, but they just… don’t. I desperately want to find other women in my specific city/area who are at the same stage as me. Not to date, but just to have a coffee and vent with someone who understands the back pain and the anxiety. Is there an app that actually matches you with local mom-friends effectively?

2. The ""3 AM Panic"" Spiral:
I have so many weird, slightly embarrassing, or scary thoughts that I’m too afraid to post on Facebook or ask my relatives because of the judgment. Google just tells me I’m dying. I need a place that feels like a safe confession booth or a judgment-free community where I can ask the ""stupid"" questions anonymously and get real advice, not medical jargon.

3. My Memory is Fading:
everyone told me to enjoy the moments, but between the nausea and the prep, I feel like I’m forgetting the small, special feelings. I don’t want to post everything on Instagram for the world to see. I wish I had a private, dedicated space—like a digital diary specifically for this journey—where I could quickly log a photo or a thought just for myself to look back on later.

Right now, I’m using:
Tinder (nope)
WhatsApp (too chaotic)
My Notes App (messy)

Does one single app exist that combines finding friends, a safe community, and a private diary? Or am I stuck juggling three different apps just to feel human?

**AITA for ""not supporting"" my cousin who shaved her head due to cancer?**

**Originally posted to r/AmItheAsshole**

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!Mental health struggles!<

[Original Post - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/md4fke/aita_for_not_supporting_my_cousin_who_shaved_her/)  **March 25, 2021**

I know the title sounds terrible, but please read first before judging!

A few months ago, my cousin, whom I am close with, was diagnosed with breast cancer. She was extremely lucky though, because it was caught very early, it had not spread, and she had a lumpectomy to remove the tumor. The last I knew, she was recovering wonderfully and the doctors believed she was ""in the clear"" and making a full recovery, other than needing to go in for frequent check-ups for awhile. So so so thankful!!!

However, yesterday, I was shocked to see she posted one of those videos with emotional music of her husband shaving her head, discussing about her fight. Immediately I panicked and called her, thinking something happened and they found it had returned. When I asked her what happened and if she was okay she said she was fine but sounded annoyed. So I pressed further... what happened? I saw you shaved your head! Do you need chemo? Is it back? Etc. She again insisted she was fine. So I flat out asked her why she cut her hair then. To which she replied, ""It's what you do when you have cancer!""

I got really confused at first, but then remarked something along the lines of ""That's wonderful that you are shaving out of solidarity of everyone fighting!"" She huffed again and said No, she didn't do it out of solidarity. She had to cut her hair and she was annoyed that she had to and complained for a solid 5 minutes about how she was going to take care of a bald head, she was going to look awful with short hair, will constantly need to wear hats this summer, etc.

I am completely baffled at this point, and I'll admit, I was a little annoyed. I don't take cancer or treatment lightly! So I said ""Cousin, people don't cut their hair just because they have cancer, they cut it because they are going to undergo a treatment that will make their hair fall out. Your treatment was done. You had no reason to cut your hair. If you did it in a show of support that's fine too. But you have no right to complain or be annoyed when you CHOSE to cut it and then post a video about it to gain sympathy because you did so.""

She told me I was being a ""witch"" and yelled at me for not supporting her and how could I be so unkind. Now... I was by her side for every appointment when she was diagnosed and her husband couldn't be there. I was there for a few days post surgery to help her and her family out. I always have and always will support her. But this is not that at all! I feel like I'm losing my mind because she just doesn't understand that having cancer automatically = cut your hair, no matter what, even if you're already (as far as you know) recovered?!

So... I might be TA because - simply put, I got snippy with a cancer patient for cutting her hair. But I feel like I'm not since it wasn't necessary to do in the first place? 
AITA?

**Remarkable-Echo9427**

>I don’t think you’re an AH but maybe there is more going on here with her emotional state. Just be there for her as much as you can. She’s obviously feeling something that has made her do this.

**OOP**

>>I am trying. I mentioned in another comment as well that I think she heard the diagnosis and was preparing for the worst and then when the worst didn't happen, it's almost like she's in the ""too good to be true"" mindset? Like even thought she's been told it's over, she doesn't feel it?

**~**

**Popular_Extension**

> NTA, sounds like you love your cousin tremendously but her drastic actions are just... Odd. Try talking to her husband and explain you weren't trying to upset her but you're confused and worried. Maybe he will have some insight.
>
> This looks like attention seeking. Maybe it is or maybe it isn't, but it's odd. Good luck!

**OOP**

>>Unfortunately, if it WAS done for attention seeking, then I can almost guarantee her husband was behind it. He's not a bad spouse or person, really. Just very ""woe is me"" if that makes sense?

**Popular_Extension**

>>>Ooooh well that sucks honestly. Have you tried talking to her parents or siblings, if she has any?

**OOP**

>>>> She has no siblings, which is part of why she and I are so close - more like sisters than cousins. Unfortunately her father passed a few years ago, and I her relationship with her mom is hit or miss, as they are both hot-headed and even the best intentions evolve. Imagine her reaction to me, but if I had responded with equal snark and it went on for hours... that's her and her mom lol
>>>>
>>>> I'm basically it other than her other close friends, so I will reach out to them as well! Not sure what all they know. I'm not saying this to toot my own horn or anything, but to be there and support her the way I tried to, not everyone is willing or able to do that?
>>>>
>>>> Idk... it's tough. Maybe I can ask her oldest daughter too? She's 13, she may be able to help me figure out her mom's mental state.


UPDATE: WOW! I can't believe this had so many reactions! For now, I am just leaving her be, and hopefully she will come to me when she is ready and we can figure out what's really going on! If we do, I will be sure to post an update!

Also, to the people who told me I was judging her and it's not my place what she does with your hair... I would just like to clarify that I told her ""why"" people with cancer cut their hair because I feel like she should know that cancer does not automatically = cutting your hair. I wasn't telling her she shouldn't cut it - that's her choice, BUT what I WAS telling her is she shouldn't complain about having done it, since she did this of her own free will. Regardless, I have admitted in several comments that I did not handle it correctly and this was still not the best response, and I own that, 100%.

[Update - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/mhwuq1/update_aita_for_not_supporting_my_cousin_who/)  **Apr 1, 2021 (1 week later)**

My Original post got a lot more responses than I thought and had a lot of people calling my cousin an idiot, so I just wanted to give an update! Some of you said her head was not in the right place, and some of you also asked about her husband, and it was a combination of those that turned out to be the truth.

It had been about a week and my cousin called me to come over and talk to her. When I got there I immediately apologized for my reaction to her actions and I assured her that will ALWAYS support her no matter what, and that I was just confused/in shock and I didn't think before I spoke.

She started bawling and told me how she felt like she was so stupid for doing what she did. She told me that ever since her cancer diagnosis, she feels like she's just been walking around feeling lost. She was so concerned about the repercussions on her family, on her daughter, that she had all this building on her and then when she was told she was practically in the clear, rather than having a weight lifted off her shoulders, she just kept feeling like she had to ""keep looking behind her waiting for the scary monster to pop back out"" and that she also has guilt because she ""got off easy"" (her words not mine)

Unfortunately, she chose to express these feelings to her husband who convinced her that shaving her head would help. A bunch of bull about how it would help her feel more in control and would be empowering. As I said in some comments, her husband is very much ""woe is me"" so I'm sure him getting a chance to show how he was just oh, so, supportive as a husband was right up his alley. He ultimately was the one that took the video, added the music and posted it on her page.

In no uncertain terms, I told her that her husband is an idiot lol. And that she should have probably have asked someone else's opinion first - heck, even her 13 year old would have talked her out of shaving her head for goodness sake. Lol

We spent a long time looking at pictures of celebrities who had shaved their heads and how they styled it as it grew back to help her, and I offered to go help her get some wigs if she wanted to as well, and that, regardless she is still beautiful and she can totally own a bald look! I also recommend that she speak to someone professional about what she is feeling. She agreed this was a good idea, and will start looking for someone.

Ultimately, we are in a great place!

**FINAL COMMENTS**

**GrumbleCake_**

> I'm glad you guys spoke and that she opened up to you.

> But yikes, does her husband have some kind of Munchausen thing going on? That part sounded very weird

>>>Whoa how did he even try to defend it?

>>>>Lol. I'd know if I would have let him get a word in, buuuut I didn't. 🤷🏽‍♀️ he just kind of sputtered and I just walked away

**IpsumDolorous**

>I'm really happy you were able to help her feel better! This is a really wholesome update. Unfortunately, your cousin's husband acted like an idiot, but your cousin still is going through a lot emotionally, and I'm glad you're there to support her while she's going through it.
Best of luck to you and your cousin!

**OOP**

>> I didn't think to put it all in the original post, but through all of her appointments except for one or two, I was the one that was there. Her husband just always gave the excuse that he ""just can't leave work like that"" and assured her he would rather skip these appointments so that he can take the time off when she ""really"" needs him.
>>
>> As a gaslit wife I can see where she would have thought that he was doing it for her benefit, but as 3rd parties, looking in, we can see how much of an INCOMPARABLE ASS it makes him.
>>
>> I didn't bring up her marriage at this point - she has enough on her plate. I did have some words with him myself though. If I ever see this happening again, I am intervening on her behalf. Otherwise, I will wait until she seems to be doing better and then maybe suggest she consider whether this marriage is beneficial for her and a good model for her daughter.

**Coffee-Historian-11**

>>> What a jerk. If his wife didn’t need him during her appointments when in the world would she actually need him? I hope she leaves him and finds someone better.

**OOP**

>>>> He claimed he would take off when she got sick so he could take care of her and their daughter while she recovered. Which he would have known she wasn't going to get sick if he would have just gone in the first place so he could understand her treatment plan.
>>>>
>>>> He did take off the day of and after her surgery, since they were a Thursday and Friday, BUT. He's been at his job for years so I know he's got more than 2 PTO days, AND I was also there both of those days during the hours my kids were at school, and he helped sponge bathe her and that was pretty much the entirety of his contribution.

We never actually talked during the class because we sat on opposite sides, but we would look at each other a decent amount. I’ve also seen her a few times around campus since then and noticed her looking at me on a couple of those occasions.

I don’t know her personally and don’t have her contact info, but I’d like to ask her out to something simple like lunch or coffee. The issue is that I don’t run into her very often, so I’m not sure how many chances I’ll realistically get to talk to her in person.

My current plan is: if I see her again (ideally if she’s sitting down studying or eating), I’d go up to her, mention that we were in the same class, talk briefly about the class, then naturally branch into other conversation. At the end, I’d ask if she wants to grab lunch sometime this week. If she says yes, I’d ask for her number so we can figure it out later, then say goodbye.

I’m wondering:

Is it okay to ask someone out in the very first real conversation like this?

Does this approach come across as respectful and normal, or could it feel awkward or pressured?

* Retail $24.95 ($8.31 each). Mini size 2.5 oz.  I did get a rare $26.95 coupon and got this gift set with it. 

* Box front: Pretty compact, no frills for a BBW gift set. The box is nice though with a subtle raised basket weave pattern. And the raised facets on the bottom of the box similar to the facet design on the bottle. These minis have a facet design while the full size has a diamond pattern design like a quilt. 

* Box back: The title on the box is “Fragrance Favorites” whereas on the website it simply says “Assorted.” Unintentional? The box lists the names and ingredients but not the fragrance notes (neither does the bottle) which I think is a shame. 

##Scents 

Midnight Addiction & Covered in Roses is still sold in store but You’re Cheeky was discontinued with summer semi annual sale this year. I do own You’re Cheeky but not the other two and wanted to try those. 

* Midnight Addiction - Supposed to be a YSL Black Opium dupe. But I tried two of the YSL Black Opium today at Macys (The Original Eau de Parfums and Le Parfum) and not sure they are that similar. Maybe one was more similar than the other (the original?). The other was much more vanilla (Le Parfum) and pretty awesome. I did smell a distinct coffee note in one of them, not sure which. Midnight addiction has notes of “ripe plum, rich almond flower and addictive coffee bean” but I don’t smell coffee. Maybe there’s like a very subtle undertone I guess. I don’t smell coffee. I do smell like a plum note similar to Maleficent. To be honest what I get most of all is like someone said on the sub before, a milder version of Everyday Luxury part 1 fragrance Floral Fantasy (which I have—it’s a Viktor & Rolf Flower Bomb dupe, maybe a bit sweeter than the inspiration). Not as potent, I guess a little less sweet because it’s minus the rose (not listed). And no patchouli (or very very mild). Honestly I probably should have clocked it as similar. I guess the notes are less distinct in Midnight Addiction. I think what drew me to trying this one is I liked the almond flower note, like a bit of smoothness in my nose. 

* Covered in Roses - alleged Parfum de Marly Delina dupe (haven’t smelled that one, bur said to be accurate). This scent is perhaps one of two (Viva Vanilla also?) that has been renewed since the EDL drop last year. It’s also said to be a beast mode perfume. I’ve tried it a bunch of times. Sometimes I like the fresh rose. Other times I find something obnoxious about it (the “sugared rosebuds”? The “blush amber”? It also has been strong to the point where I’m just over it. I’ve gotten Always & Forever, Rose, and Heirloom Rose instead, in that order. It’s not even that I like rose that much—I’ve just been stubbornly wanting to find my version of rose. I do also have rose bushes outside my home (i think Heirloom Rose is closest to their scent) and I like those. Anyway I recognize there is something nice about Covered in Roses, and it is very popular. So I wanted to try it in a mini. I think one of my errors has been spraying too much. I usually double tap the spray. I guess once is enough here. Being minimal with this mist seems to bring out more of its fresh rose and less of its amber. When I do that I can smell some of the green in the scent which is what I particularly enjoy in scents like Heirloom Rose or Always and Forever. It’s nice to be able to smell it also in Covered in Roses. I think the blush amber is a little like You’re Cheeky. 

* You’re Cheeky - Carolina Herrara Good Girl Blush dupe. Heard this one was less sharp than Good Girl Blush which some like better. I haven’t compared them but do think they are similar. There’s something about this fragrance that reminds me of cherries. Can’t quite place it. I like the bit of crème in the fragrance. I would like to see if it pairs ok with Covered in Roses—maybe? To be honest I didn’t need another You’re Cheeky. It’s a perfume that I’m partly not sure what it’s supposed to be or to convey. I don’t mind it though. 

Overall: this set is called “Fragrance Favorites.” While these three aren’t my favorites, i think they all have something in common so I can see how these three would be someone’s favorites. I think there’s enough in common where there might be some layering potential. I think the strength of the three are also pretty good, in the order of Covered in Roses, You’re Cheeky, Midnight Addiction. Overall I think this is a pretty solid trio that makes sense together as a set. Someone did do a good job. They are all very perfumey. And have different amounts of floral, fruity, amber, crème. I’m not mad at the set but probably didn’t need it either. Actually the set does show me what belongs together and how they relate which I hadn’t considered before. You’re Cheeky makes more sense next to these two. On these merits i give an 8/10.

So many posts are like:  
“Drowning in student loans lol”  
“Rent is insane but at least I got my coffee”

Debt seems completely normalized, almost joked about, and coffee is treated like survival equipment. Not fancy, not indulgent just necessary to function.

From the outside it feels strange, because the stress is real, but the tone is so casual. Like yeah, everything’s expensive, everyone owes money, and the answer is caffeine and memes.

Not judging, just observing. It feels like modern American life is:

Ive been Vegertrain for 2 years now. Not fully Vegan and never will I think, but anythings possible so maybe I will one day. But for one I eat meat once a month for 1 meal because I work on a ship 1 month out at sea and one month on land and its not exactly somewhere you can be picky about what you want to eat. So I eat meat once a month to make sure my body can still digest it without problems. I did it a full 2 months when I first started then ate meat on the ship and it was terrible.

Anyways right now im getting ready to get a new job which means I can finally stop eating meat all together. However a problem I have right now is when im lazy and don't want to cook I can't go anywhere to get a quick fast food meal. Major cities in America have vegan and vegetterian options but not mine. and the vegeterain gas station/coffee shop meals are terrible. They are uneatable. Most of them are just lettech and bell pepper in a spinach wrap.

the second problem is when I eat meat sub (ones I make at home) like bean burgers or mushroom burgers, they taste okay but they don't hit that note that I get when eating a burger. Or when I make fried chicken tofu it taste good but I know im not eating chicken even after I freeze it for that ""meaty"" texture"".

Are these just problems im always going to have and just need to get into the habit of cooking ever meal ever day and knowing im not going to get that satifiying taste im looking for? I feel like since the fat is missing from most veggie burgers it just can't compare to a normal meat burger. I tried mixing frozen butter into it but it doesnt help and just becomes more breakable when cooking. So idk what to do to make meat meals hit the same notes.

Any and all advice welcome.

Edit : Yeah guys, I guess I should have said this but I didn't think it was a issue. I do not choose to be vegetarian to not harm animals. I choose to be vegetarian to not be a part of the problem of the meat industry. I do personally do not belive in stop eating meat 100% and even when I can go months without eating meat I think I will eat meat a few times a year but my goal is to not be a part of it. My def of animal cruilty might be different than yours but I do not see killing a animal for the purpose of food evil. However I do find killing animals the way its currently being done for profit as evil. 

This is a quesiton about flavor and cravings. Thinking about saving the animals isn't something I'm setting out to do. IK me doing ""my part"" isn't going to make a difference long term so patting myself on the back isn't enough motivation for me to not crave a hamburger. Im not trying to attack anyone or belittle anyone, these are my own thoguhts and ideals on it. If I had to the money to own a chicken cope and kill them myself I would find that 100% ethical. However I don't and I choose not to eat meat because many animals are getting killed and wasted for no reason. 

ik that might make some people upset, im sorry. Im not here to change anyone's mind and im not open to having my mind changed. I came here to get better flavors from my food. Not to talk about ethics of food. I choose to ask Vegans about non meat food because Vegan cooking seems to be better than vegetarian cooking on the internet",0,1765774688.0,veganrecipes,33,0.46,False

We never actually talked during the class because we sat on opposite sides, but we would look at each other a decent amount. I’ve also seen her a few times around campus since then and noticed her looking at me on a couple of those occasions.

I don’t know her personally and don’t have her contact info, but I’d like to ask her out to something simple like lunch or coffee. The issue is that I don’t run into her very often, so I’m not sure how many chances I’ll realistically get to talk to her in person.

My current plan is: if I see her again (ideally if she’s sitting down studying or eating), I’d go up to her, mention that we were in the same class, talk briefly about the class, then naturally branch into other conversation. At the end, I’d ask if she wants to grab lunch sometime this week. If she says yes, I’d ask for her number so we can figure it out later, then say goodbye.

I’m wondering:

Is it okay to ask someone out in the very first real conversation like this?

Does this approach come across as respectful and normal, or could it feel awkward or pressured?

Is this better than trying to play a “long game,” given that I might not see her consistently?

TL;DR 

18M wants to ask out 18F from a past class; minimal interaction but repeated eye contact — is asking her to lunch in the first convo okay?

1pmywd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/valvereplacement/comments/1pmywd8/need_support_please/,Need support please,"I am still in hospital 8 days after procedure. I am breaking down mentally. Whats going on now is almost worse than the procedure itself

I got a uti from the catheter and that has caused me agony. So the uti symptoms are basic uti symptoms. I have had one before. Noticed what was happening. Alerted the doctor. 
The drips he gave me to fix it are causing me agony. But whatever I braved it out. The doctor switched the antibiotics to different ones 2 days ago. They are all through a line in my arm. These drips are BRUTAL. they sting amd I end uo clutching a pillow while crying everytime they give me one. I have complained multiple times. I got called a crybaby by the nurse yrsterday :) She literally watched me survive one of the roughest procedures ever without even worrying about it. And now I finally start breaking down anf they think I'm exagerating pain. when the dr swtiched it moved to 4x thesr drips a day. I was told over and over again that I would be leaving soon. Last night I had a meltdown. - a polite meltdown because I like the nurses still.  They gave me a drip at 10pm which I wasnt expecting since they had given me pain meds and a sleeping tablet already. I took it and tried to fall asleep listening to something on my headphones and  I experienced audio hallucinations -someone talking to me and gunshots. I got up knowing what this was and I -26 year old male- called my mom and cried for about an hour on the phone. My mom is extremely well qualified and used to work as a sister. Eventually stepping away from icu and moving into working as a business partner that takes care for elderly. I know she will be able to help. 
Anyways she told me to not accept the next drip at 5am until a doctor tells me what the hell is going on. She called the nurse and the blood test company is  apparently recommending a further 7-10 days of this before the uti is gone. The doctor told me to relax about results four days ago and I completely trusted him. I still do. Hes very clever and I have been listening to him but this is hell. My last gripe is that my mental decline is getting very serious very quickly. Last night even after telling them I would be refusing the next morning early treatment and they needed to give me time to rest, I got woken up 3 more times between 12-6. Blood tests at 2am. The blood tests were for INR!??? I know what that is but I am worried about infection. I couldnt give a damn about my inr right now. I have a machine at home. I can also happily stop by the hopital once a day for blood tests. I lost it again. The blood tests nurse listened and helped me add infection markers to this 2 am test and went back to sleep. 4:30 AM my lights blast on again. Tea or coffee? This is all after I explained why I cant wake up so early again. I am worried about these hallucinations. I then realised I actually havent slept in almost two weeks. I have always been a bad sleeper but the fear for the operation made it worse a few days before going in. Obviously. I dont count the awful morphine nights in icu as sleep. My mom is on her way now and shes going to sit with me until the doctor gets here. I had awful little 2 hour dreams

My right leg is destroyed. I limp around everywhere and the nerve pain is shocking. He also said he wasnt doing a cabg and I am so confused why this has happened
Basically the surgery was actually a breeze compared to whats happening to me now. Idk what to say. I am scared, I definitely could be diagnosed with bi polar and some mild schizoid disorder currently as I am.
I am constantly nauseated and my right arm feels like its about to fall off from the stress of that drip. It is taking me so long to type this all out nicely and explain myself. My mom listened and believed me which is more than I got from the doctors and nurses here. Am I just being a baby over this? Should I accept the medicine to calm me down that the dr recommended yesterday?
Last gripe but I am actually astounded by yhe stupidity of this general ward. The icu was fantastic but this is plain stupid.
They take my tenperature and vitals alnlst two hours after pain killers. While I am sweating and clutching onto the pillow fighting my drip session. I was wearing earphones 2 days ago blasting music yo get me tgrough it. The nurse moved my headphones aside and took my temperature in my ear and asked why I was hot and why my pulse was so high. She cant seem to figure out the position I am in is causing me to have hot ears and a high pulse? Now all the other temp checks will always come out low after painkillers obviously. Pain killers cool down temperature. I am not sure any of these vitals they have taken in the last 4 days are helping the doctor because you unfortunately need to think just a little about the timing of checking vitals you know?

Last thing is the ticking is loud. I am just in such a bad space right now. If anyone reads this whole post then thabk you. I dont know how coherent it is. I am just tired, extremely sore, and sick of being woken up 6 timed a night on sleeping tablets. This isnt going well for me. I see no end right now. These nurses are dumb. The doctor is faling me and not being open aboit whats hapoening. Its like he is waiting for me to ask the right questions and I am losing it. I hope this ends soon.

An Asian Koel glides through the summer morn’ / I overheard her chirps, like harps of Turk / I dress in a coal turtleneck, crack my cold fingers / Add black snake leather hands / She came into town in a voluptuous dress / With white specks around her neck that stretch / Down, just like waterfalls, towards her legs / Which are mysteriously yet beautifully covered / By her majestic yet humble wings, which rest / She knows modesty can drive an honest man mad

So, I’m calling you first, / With a small dance, I rehearsed / The dance of the birds

Don't be afraid to walk up to me for a simple talk / Try me, you're great, great, great-grandfather will not halt / This desire to know you / To know what your dreams taste like / And what you believe is love / Don't you see—I was born from the sun 

Sepia brown bosom and velvety shoulder blades / Torrid tongue, building words out of a rice terrain / A jim-dandy sound for all / I want to believe your long peak, which whistles songs / Is it your lips or mouth that I want? / Yes, I want it to stop the aching of my grainy thirst / Maybe you stole those pretty songs from the birds / Coffee thighs walk past me as I court your name / You tell me that you wonder what life would be like / I say erase that line to ‘I know that life would be great’

1pmyre3,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1pmyre3/4_months_no_caffeine_in_put/,4 months no caffeine in put,"37 M here. Ive been wanting to quit caffeine for many years since my early 20s.I hated the fact that I was addicted to it. I hated the crashes, the highs and the lows. I hated that I had to depend on something just to go on my day, to go on a date,workout,get going in the morning etc. Being an addict I knew this would be a problem for me. I knew I was addicted to caffeine and my mood depended on it and I did not like that. My caffeine use wasn't that bad in the beginning. Id have a cup or two during the day and I would also drink a pre workout before the gym. So you can say I was consuming around 500-700 MGs in the beginning which later escalated to 1000 MG+ at my worst.

This is the longest Ive been off caffeine in my life. Absolutely 0 chocolate,decaf,tea or coffee. I'm not going to lie it wasn't easy at all in the beginning. The 1st 3 days were brutal,I didnt want to get out of bed or move. When I quit caffeine I was also 3 months sober from opiates, so mind you that I was dealing with withdrawals that are similar to caffeine such as low energy, motivation and depression. However opiate withdrawal is one of the hardest,so I knew if i could quit opiates I could quit caffeine too. I just pushed through and had to quit caffeine as well because it was making me extremely anxious and jittery.

Here are the pros and cons i can think of so far for being 4 months off it.

Cons

1. Can affect social life since coffee and teas are used in social gatherings. It kind of sucks to say no to it and you crave it badly in the moments.
2. You don't have that cup of joe to look forward to or to pick you up in the morning or anytime of the day
3. Weight gain. I gained about 10 pounds. I lift 3 times a week along with cardio and eat healthy,never eat out,no fast food, no junk food. Despite I gained weight because my appetite went up like crazy.I had to start dieting to lose the fat. I packed on alot of fat as my appetite went up and cravings for carbs.

4.Working out kind of sucks without caffeine since you don't have pre workout to pick you up before the gym. Caffeine is definitely performance enhancing, especially in endurance activities.

5. I miss the buzz and the high. Let's be honest, its a fucking drug and its a good drug. But remember, drugs are bad kids.

6. You crave it in good moments. Can't have that good ol cup of joe in a nice sunny afternoon.

7.I miss fasting and having black coffee on empty stomach.

Pros

1. Improved focus and awareness. I'm a gamer and I can definitely the difference. This was a huge indicator that helped me keep going. Caffeine is a scam as we are told that it improves focus or alertness-it does quite the opposite.

2.More present in the moment. This goes with the focus, I just feel more in the present and not feel all over the place like I did on caffeine.

[3.My](http://3.My) thoughts feel clearer. At first you aren't going to feel this way because you will get mind fog as you quit.

4.Less mood swings. Ive struggled with mental health and mood disorders. This one was a no brainer to motivate me to keep going. I just feel better overall with my mental health. This is probably the biggest reason for me to keep going. It made my bipolar disorder so much worse. My mood is alot more stable now and Im not all over the place.

5.More balanced energy throughout the day. No crashes and don't need coffee middle of the day to keep going.

6. Workouts feel better. Better pumps in the gym. This one took a while to adjust to but once I got going, I actually feel more fresh and alert after working out, instead of crashin from the preworkout  and feeling like shit.

7. Improved Libido and erections. I remember when I was in jail I was talking to one of the inmates that's been there for a while about coffee. He went on to say how coffee is bad for you and fucks with your dick. Being 4 months no caffeine, I can tell you that it really does. My ED is pretty much gone now.

8.Vivid dreams and better sleep. Soon as I quit i started dreaming like im on LSD. I still dream every night. I used to rarely dream or remember my dreams. Every night is a trip.

9.Less headaches. In the beginning when I quit it got worse but overtime my migraines are alot better.

10.Anxiety almost vanished. Caffeine made me super anxious. Id feel good for 30 mins or so then feel anxious and down. Thats gone  now. My anxiety has improved drastically.

That's all I can remember for now. I just wanted to share my input, perhaps I could get other advanced quitters to share their stories as well. I'm not going to lie Ive been craving coffee pretty bad lately ,its one of the reasons why I made this post. I remember some of the posters saying things got even better 6,9.12+ months on so forth. I definitely feel better than I used to be and I don't play to use caffeine anytime soon.",15,1765773970.0,decaf,4,0.95,False

When I'm walking the aisles with my pram I always say ""excuse me"" just to more let people know I'm passing with the pram so I don't accidentally bump them or they don't get alarmed if I do. I have an icandy lime and it's not a skinny pram even though it's a single - especially if I have the coffee cup attachment on, but also it's not massive either. I'm worried about bumping people so I always err on the side of caution and try to be polite and of course wait if need be.

Lately I've had a few people snap at me when I've done this. One lady snapped at me that I had enough room(barely) and I had to scrape the wheels of my pram against the shelf to pass her, another looked me in the eyes and moved further into he centre of the aisle while telling me to go back and loop around. Plus lots of people who groan or sigh when I navigate around them.

Am I breaking some rule I dont know about? Or have I just had a few too many run ins with people who are cranky this Christmas season? Please educate me because I'm tired and starting to feel a lot of anxiety about going out with the pram at the minute.

Edit: oh and I also of course say thank you/smile etc when I pass or people move for me, of course.",17,1765773844.0,BabyBumpsandBeyondAu,34,1.0,False

1pmyn27,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakingPoints/comments/1pmyn27/how_trump_intends_to_put_severe_tariffs_on/,"How Trump intends to put ""severe tariffs"" on Canadian fertilizer, without somehow destroying American farming.","Relevance to BP:  Ah you know... economic populism, that sort of stuff.  It's what the fans claim to care about, as opposed to those culture wars and violence that keeps them so distracted.

Okay so [this is what fucko is saying now](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TeqviL36Yto).  Pretty standard, right?  What else is new.  Except fertilizer is one of those things I honestly did not think Pussy-Neck had the fallopian fortitude to single out.  I would have guessed this would be one of the last things he would dare try to tariff from us, but like I say, game on.  So lets workshop how this is going to go.

The reason you buy Canadian fertilizer is potash, which is an incredibly useful potassium-based fertilizer that provides vital nitrogen and phosphorous for many crops around the world, including corn, soybeans, wheat, potatoes, cotton, citrus fruits, grapes, tomatoes, and various vegetables such as carrots, watermelons, and peas.

Canada is the largest producer of potash in the world, producing 15 million metric tons back in 2024.  We provide about 30% of the world global potash.  The application of this fertilizer is critical for maximum efficiency.  It is a very convenient source for American potash being right next door, and we provide around 85% of the potash that America imports.

America is the 10th largest producer of potash in the world producing 420K metric tons last year.  America needs around 5.3 million metric tons for all of it's farming needs. So to provide for that potash domestically and without  imports, America would need to increase production at least 12 fold.  That's definitely not going to happen according to industry reps.  And even if it could happen, it would take years to implement.

Trump has been trying to bolster your own production for months now.  It seems like it hasn't really worked out like he'd hoped.  So you can imagine why I've been seeing this as an empty threat.  More so than his other empty threats.  It's a bit like trying to tariff coffee from Brazil and Columbia.  You ain't producing that shit on your own.  And unlike potash, you could actually live without coffee, and not have mass starvation.

Our good buddies Germany and Israel are the 5th and 6th largest producers with 3 million and 2.4 million metric tons respectively.  Germany mainly sells to other Europeans, which only makes sense with the free trade of the European single market.  Israel does sell a pretty insignificant amount to the U.S..  You'd think Israel would have the common courtesy to give Trump a reach around after everything, and prioritize America for exports.  And it look likes Israel has increased potash exports in the past year.

Is it enough to replace what Trump gets from us?  Lol no.  Still not even close.  So now lets look at #2, #3, and #4, because those are really the only alternatives you've got left.  That would be Russia, Belarus and China with 9 million, 7 million and 6.3 million metric tons respectively.  Hey, that outnumbers our 15 million, if you put all those dictatorships together!

Except, well... China has a lot of mouths to feed, and is another net importer of potash.  And due to sanctions, Russia exports their potash mainly to China, India, and a few more poor countries in their eastern sphere of influence.  That doesn't stop them from selling potash to you America, because you know... America, but still, America is not the priority buyer, and Russia definitely is not going to flip on China for you, no matter how much the China hawks wish it.

So I guess that just leaves Belaru-- OH HEY LOOK!  [https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpwlkklyxo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpwlkklyxo)

That's the plan!  It all makes sense now!  He's going to replace Canadian potash with Belarus potash!  For no other reason than to try and cripple my economy, he's going to risk your entire agricultural sector by lifting sanctions on a landlocked European country, and presumably ship out their potash from Kaliningrad, with the significant added cost of transport.  My gawd!  How could I not have seen this 5D chess!

Well I gotta say.  I respect the pettiness.  As far as hatred for Canada goes, Gunty is certainly committed.  Sounds like your groceries are going to get more expensive no matter what, if he goes through with any of this.   I guess we'll just have to find out if it's TACO, or if you're going to eat the cost of these tariffs, or if we get undercut by Lukashenko.  Gee I wonder if there is a huge demand for potash globally.  Do you think any other county would want our fertilizer instead?

Anyways, I'm glad those Belarusian Political dissidents are free.  Here's hoping that ends up fucking the Lukashenko regime in the end.  That would make it alllll worth it to me.",7,1765773567.0,BreakingPoints,3,1.0,False

An Asian Koel glides through the summer morn’ / I overheard her chirps, like harps of Turk / I dress in a coal turtleneck, crack my cold fingers / Add black snake leather hands / She came into town in a voluptuous dress / With white specks around her neck that stretch / Down, just like waterfalls, towards her legs / Which are mysteriously yet beautifully covered / By her majestic yet humble wings, which rest / She knows modesty can drive an honest man mad

So, I’m calling you first, / With a small dance, I rehearsed / The dance of the birds

Don't be afraid to walk up to me for a simple talk / Try me, you're great, great, great-grandfather will not halt / This desire to know you / To know what your dreams taste like / And what you believe is love / Don't you see—I was born from the sun 

Sepia brown bosom and velvety shoulder blades / Torrid tongue, building words out of a rice terrain / A jim-dandy sound for all / I want to believe your long peak, which whistles songs / Is it your lips or mouth that I want? / Yes, I want it to stop the aching of my grainy thirst / Maybe you stole those pretty songs from the birds / Coffee thighs walk past me as I court your name / You tell me that you wonder what life would be like / I say erase that line to ‘I know that life would be great’

Important: The Ultra however has adjustable shot volumes/times as well as temperature adjustment but can take few minutes to warm up without flash heating and apparently the steam wand isn’t as good
It also had pre infusion and a 58mm porta filter but no Over Pressure Valve

**How to Take Heavy, Rustic Colorado Architecture and Make It Feel Soft and Modern (It involves Limewash and the perfect warm white—BM OC-45)**

[DAECO PAINTING](https://preview.redd.it/ltbzxt5rpa7g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a1ad2e1daac8a4e5d606f00074aef5ea96f66e8)

Hey everyone, I wanted to share a recent project that solved a common problem we see in older, mountain-style homes here in Colorado: beautiful stone and timber, but the space feels too dark and heavy.

The key was moving away from opaque paint and using a custom-tinted **limewash** on the stone.

* **Why Limewash?** It's mineral-based and breathable, but more importantly, it quieted the harsh color variation in the stone while keeping all the natural texture. It gives that perfect ""collected over time"" patina.
* **The Wall Color:** We used **Benjamin Moore OC-45 (Swiss Coffee)**. In Colorado's intense light, a cooler white looks icy, and a brighter one glares. OC-45's gentle creaminess wraps the room in warmth and acts as a ""velvety envelope"" that ties the stone, beams, and furniture together.

It's all about respecting the permanent architecture while using sophisticated finishes to lighten the mood. If you're struggling with a stone/timber room, this process is a template.
