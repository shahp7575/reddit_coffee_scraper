Not my usual type, but he was nice. I met him in a town an hour away from mine. My friend and I were in town for an event and that’s where I met him. Since we were an hour away, my friend and I booked a hotel so we could enjoy ourselves and not drink and drive. We planned on leaving first thing in the morning to return to our dogs. I told all of this to Jake. 

Jake wanted to meet for coffee in the morning before I left, but when I woke up and saw the text, it was already 10:30 AM and if I left right there and then I would not be home until 11:30 AM. That’s already pushing it for my dog. He needs to be walked so he won’t use the bathroom in the house. I also needed to go back home so I can sleep the rest of the day before my night shift. I work 6pm-6am, 3-4 days a week. I explained that to Jake. So he asked if we could meet 12 pm on Friday and I agreed. 

However I didn’t hear from him since Tuesday and since HE is the one that wanted to go on the date I thought that HE should follow up and confirm. I’m already going out of my way agreeing to an afternoon date that is an hour away. This will greatly affect my sleep. (Imagine asking a person who works a regular 9-5 to go on a date at midnight, an hour away from the home). 

Since he didn’t follow up and confirm I assumed that it wasn’t happening anymore and continued with my schedule. I didn’t care to go on the date anyway as it was going to interrupt my sleep. When I woke up Friday evening at around 6 pm. I saw texts from him at 11:15 AM, asking if the date at noon was still happening. I obviously didn’t respond cuz I was sleeping. I responded to him saying “Hey, I didn’t hear from you since Tuesday so I didn’t think we were still meeting up. I work nights and I sleep during the day, so I am barely seeing your messages” 

This is now the 3rd time I am telling him that I work nights and what does he respond with? “Oh no problem, how about we meet at noon tomorrow for coffee?” again, in a town that is an hour away from me. I didn’t even respond.

1heydpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_beautifulmind8494/comments/1heydpa/exploring_land_investment_opportunities_in_panama/,Exploring Land Investment Opportunities in Panama,"Panama, a thriving hub of international business and tourism, has become an increasingly attractive destination for land and real estate investment. Whether you’re looking to build a dream home, develop a business, or invest in agricultural ventures, Panama’s diverse landscapes and investor-friendly policies offer immense potential for those seeking land opportunities.

# Why Invest in Land in Panama?

Panama’s strategic location, connecting North and South America and providing access to both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, makes it an ideal choice for land investment. Here are some key reasons why investing in land in Panama is a smart move:

* **Affordable Land Prices:** Compared to North America and Europe, Panama offers competitive land prices, making it accessible for a range of budgets.
* **Diverse Geographies:** From pristine beachfront lots to lush mountain terrains and fertile farmland, Panama’s varied landscapes cater to a wide array of preferences and uses.
* **Stable Economy:** With a strong economy fueled by the Panama Canal, free trade zones, and international banking, Panama provides a stable environment for investment.
* **Investor Incentives:** The Panamanian government offers attractive incentives, such as tax exemptions for foreign investors and residency programs like the Friendly Nations Visa.

**Read:** [**https://panamasovereign.com/lots-land/**](https://panamasovereign.com/lots-land/)

# Popular Areas for Land Investment

1. **Beachfront Properties** Areas like **Coronado**, **Pedasí**, and the **Azuero Peninsula** are hotspots for beachfront land. These locations are perfect for building luxury homes, vacation rentals, or resorts, thanks to their stunning coastal views and growing tourism markets.
2. **Mountain Retreats** The cooler climates and scenic beauty of mountain towns like **Boquete** and **El Valle de Antón** make them ideal for retirement homes, eco-lodges, or agricultural projects. These regions are renowned for their coffee plantations and outdoor activities.
3. **Urban Development** In and around **Panama City**, land is in demand for commercial and residential development. Proximity to the capital ensures access to modern infrastructure and amenities, making it a prime area for businesses or high-rise projects.
4. **Fertile Farmland** Panama’s fertile soil and tropical climate are perfect for agricultural investments. Areas like **Chiriquí** and **Veraguas** are known for farming and cattle-raising, offering opportunities in coffee, fruits, and sustainable agriculture.

# What to Consider When Buying Land in Panama

* **Title and Zoning Laws:** Ensure the property has a clear title and verify its zoning regulations, as these dictate permissible uses for the land.
* **Infrastructure:** Assess access to roads, utilities, and water sources, especially in remote areas.
* **Legal Assistance:** Work with a reputable local lawyer and real estate agent to navigate the buying process and ensure compliance with Panamanian laws.
* **Permits and Development Costs:** Factor in the time and cost of obtaining building permits and necessary infrastructure development.

# The Future of Land Investment in Panama

With continued growth in tourism, infrastructure development, and foreign investment, Panama’s real estate market shows no signs of slowing down. Land remains a relatively low-cost entry point with high potential for appreciation, making it an excellent choice for long-term investment.

Whether you’re drawn to the tranquility of the countryside, the allure of beachfront living, or the energy of urban life, Panama offers a wealth of opportunities to turn your vision into reality.",1,1734285983.0,u_beautifulmind8494,0,1.0,False
1heyd4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1heyd4j/bf_of_10_months_screamed_in_my_face/,Bf of 10 months screamed in my face ,"
Last night after we had done some late night shopping, we were in his car and drove him. Sitting outside my house I adjusted his rearview mirror to fix my makeup. He has said before that when I touch his mirror it annoys him, but I never do it WHILE he’s driving. I always do it if we’re parked so it’s safe to do so. Then when he went to fix the mirror he hurt his hand I guess and he just screamed at the top of his lungs at me saying, “I told you not to touch it” or something along those lines. I cant even explain how nasty his tone was. I’ve heard him yell before, but this was extreme. I was sure that the whole neighborhood heard him. I started to tear up and silently grabbed my things and headed inside. He came with me because he was planning to spend the night. After an hour of pretty much silence he went to bed. I tried to wake him up a few minutes after he fell asleep to see if he wanted to talk and he said “no I’m sleeping”. The sleep was terrible, we are usually cuddling and kissing throughout the night but this time it was cold and distant. This morning I asked if he wanted to get coffee, he ignored me. Then he said he was going to leave and I started to cry a little bit. He asked me, “why are you still upset about last night?” and I told him that he hurt my feelings. Then he said I didn’t respect his boundaries about touching the rearview mirror. Then he pretended like he left my house, he opened and shut the door but he was waiting there to see if I’d come out to the kitchen I guess. I was sobbing at that point and when I saw he was still there I said “why are you still here?” in between tears. I went to the bathroom and locked the door, only for him to knock on the window from the outside, so I just went into my room and cried some more. After about 30 minutes I texted him saying that I have never left him alone to cry and that his actions are looking like he doesn’t give a fuck about me. He hasn’t replied yet.

I just don’t know why he did that. After he yelled at me in the car he did say “sorry that was on overreaction” but it was such a half ass apology. You don’t just scream at the top of your lungs in someone’s face then try to brush it off and act like everything’s all good and dandy after spitting out a “sorry”. He was acting like I did something wrong the whole night, no affection, no trying to apologize more, no comfort, nothing. If he was the one crying about something I would make sure to comfort him and have a conversation to try and make him feel better even if he was unwilling or said he wanted me to leave. I have never just shut him out like that and leave him alone to cry. 

I definitely feel like he has some anger issues because he is always snapping over little things. Usually I can let it go but this time it was very different, like I said, I have never heard him use such a loud voice with me. I’ve never even yelled at him like that before. I’m just feeling terrible because no matter how hard I push he isn’t going to understand why I’m so upset. He’s just going to tell me I have a victim mentality or something. I get that I shouldn’t mess with his stuff anymore but I don’t know why he couldn’t have handled this maturely and had an actual conversation on why he doesn’t want me to touch his stuff, rather than just yelling at me. And he never gets the time to sleep at my house so now I’m sad that this opportunity was wasted because we were so distant that it felt like I was sleeping alone. 

What do I do about this? I just feel so unloved and disregarded right now. I don’t want to break up with him because I really do love him. But I want my feelings to be validated. Advice? ",1,1734285941.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1heybcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1heybcr/being_distracted_and_performing_poorly_in_my/,Being distracted and performing poorly in my studies/responsibilities as a result of fights/emotional/verbal abuse ,"Sorry...this is long.

I am in the middle of finals for my graduate program (it’s virtual), and I didn't feel that coming to visit him (we are long-distance, right now he lives across the globe now for his school) would be a great idea for my studies, but he would bring it up regularly for months, he begged me to visit him, and we argued about it. For context, the country he’s living in is not great, economically, socially, or otherwise. There alcohol problem here is severe, and most people here are racist, homophobic, misogynistic, and generally not very friendly to foreigners. I’ve had several bad experiences there in the past, including neighbors threatening to assault me and random people breaking in.I miss him and love him, a big part of me really wanted to see him even though I knew I hate being in this country and it would likely distract me from doing my best in school. So I told him, ok, I will buy a plane ticket and come to visit you for the end of my semester, then we will enjoy a short trip/vacation together. I told him that my only request was that he would not start any fights or arguments with me, because I cannot afford to be distracted during my final exam period. He promises not to, and so I came to see him. The travel time required me to request an extension for my assignments but I hoped to catch-up when I arrived.

He treated me amazingly well, showering me with attention and affection for the first couple of weeks. He told me I would not lift a finger; he would do all the cleaning, cooking, dishes, shopping, etc, and I would just relax and do school work (I still insisted on helping out, though). However, after a couple weeks he had another rage episode over nothing. I’d only slept a couple hours (I had to wake up early for a meeting in my home country’s time zone) so I was exhausted. I barely had time to eat anything before my meeting started, and I left a cutting board and a knife in the sink. He saw it in the sink, started berating me (despite his previous claim that he didn’t want me to do any dishes or cleaning) and being really rude/disrespectful. I told him that he was being mean and calmly asked him to please stop speaking to me disrespectfully. He got even more angry, and eventually lost his temper and yelled, pounding his fists and angrily throwing the knife into the sink.Whenever he acts like this, it makes me feel so anxious.I left the apartment for the entire day, staying in various coffee shops for hours, my heart rate elevated and unable to concentrate.

When I returned, he made me dinner and gave a half-assed apology saying I was overreacting and it “wasn’t a big deal”. I told him that throwing things was a big deal and that he should acknowledge that and apologize. He got really angry, told me that he hoped the food “tasted like shit”, and continued yelling at me. It escalated to the point where he was throwing random things as hard as he could around the apartment. I sat there watching stuff ricochet off the wall and told him he was scaring me. He told me that I “hadn’t even seen him be scary yet” and that he could “tear up the entire apartment”. I asked him to please leave me alone so I could calm down and go back to studying but he wouldn’t. He continued shouting at me, saying that since I distracted him with “this bullshit” and kept him from studying, he wasn’t going to let me study, either. I told him that our fights always make me feel terrible the next day (I have a chronic health/pain condition) and he told me “good, I hope you feel terrible”. Then he told me we are over, and that I should find a hotel for the night, buy a plane ticket, and “fuck off to America.” 

I was about to book a hotel when he stopped me and suddenly became really sad and upset. He said that he didn’t mean anything he said, and that he was being an idiot. He spent the next few days profusely apologizing, saying I deserved better, that he was wrong, that he was on a waitlist to see a psychiatrist soon, that his behavioral outbursts are a result of ADHD, PTSD, and frustration from his cognitive/psychiatric problems. He begged me not to leave him, saying he will work on his triggers and behaviors but also that he does not want to or mean to be this way, and essentially that his brain is defective but he is working on it and still loves me. He promised not to fight with me again. It took me 4-5 days to emotionally recover from the anxiety and emotional exhaustion of the fight, during which time I was not able to study efficiently and had to ask for another extension.

He was extremely nice for over a week, then he picked another fight with me. It wasn’t as bad this time: no yelling or throwing things, but he still was extremely agitated and rude (raising his voice and calling me names) over a simple misunderstanding. This time, instead of defending myself, I stopped responding as soon as he acted disrespectful and simply walked away. Again, I spent the entire day in a coffee shop, barely able to concentrate. While I was gone, he demanded that I apologize for my “disgusting rude behavior” (the rude behavior in question was me walking away when he raised his voice), said he didn’t have time for my BS, and would ignore me until I apologized. He insisted that it was extremely disrespectful of me to leave without responding to him or excusing myself. I tried to explain to him that the last time I tried to engage with him, he yelled at me and threw things, so this was my strategy for avoiding that.

Afterwards, he apologized once again and admitted that he was wrong. But it still ruined an entire day where I was exhausted and could not study, and it took me another couple of days to recover. At this point, I had lost over a week of productivity time in total and I was very behind in school. I told him that if he picked another fight with me, I would have no choice but to leave and fly home early because I cannot afford to fail out of my program because of his unregulated emotions causing fights. I had to file for an incomplete grade for my program, telling my professors that my health was bad and I needed more time to be able to succeed. 

I am grateful they granted me an incomplete grade so I have more time to study, but that means I will not have a winter break. My program is continuous, so winter break is our only break in the entire year that’s more than a few days long. This means that instead of enjoying the holidays, going on a vacation somewhere beautiful, relaxing, and having a good time, I will be studying. It’s so frustrating how much his rage outbursts episodes are affecting my ability to concentrate. He’s agreed to receive regular psychiatric help, but also tells me I need to stop being so sensitive and not take our fights personally. He says I need to recover from our fights faster and not let myself get so distressed by them.

TL;DR: I agreed to fly across the world to see him, under the stipulation that he would not fight with me. At first he didn’t, but then started a fight (yelling/shouting/throwing things) over two dishes left in the sink. He apologized profusely, agreed not to fight with me again, but then started another (more minor) fight a week later. The fights emotionally exhaust me, distracting me from my studies. As a result, I’ve had to ask for multiple deadline extensions and file for an incomplete grade, meaning I will miss christmas break and instead need to study over the holidays so I don’t fail out of my graduate program.",1,1734285808.0,emotionalabuse,0,1.0,False

So I decided to make my own server named ' ICT Crypto Wellness Trading Team '.

The idea behind this server is to create a platform for traders to join forces, my idea was if we combine some brightest minds who have excellent grasp of ICT concepts, to consult eachother, and brainstorm perfect trading ideas for crypto coins (mainly Bitcoin or other alts) during the most volatile trading sessions, lay out their trading plan, we could argue what the daily bias is, someone analyses NY midnight open, news events, New York trading session, after lunch, Asian session, PD Arrays and so on...

All This combined, we could make decent profits, if we join our forces.

Why Wellness? Because this server will be a place where you will relax, lay out trade plans, and then make profits, make some coffee and then watch the price go in your favor. But don't get too relaxed, because there will be strong incentive to contribute and give your input, this is not your classic discord server, please don't just join and be inactive, it will be a team.

If you like the concept and would like to join, make a comment and I will DM you the link, I don't expect much interest as I know most of people in ICT trade indices and forex, but I know that there might be certain people who will make a great team. I just made the server so don't be surprised that it is empty, even 5 of us working together would be great. 

If someone joins, tomorrow we can make some great profits in the NY session!

My program is continuous, so winter break is our only break in the entire year that’s more than a few days long. This means that instead of enjoying the holidays, going on a vacation somewhere beautiful, relaxing, and having a good time, I will be studying. It’s so frustrating how much his rage outbursts episodes are affecting my ability to concentrate. He’s agreed to receive regular psychiatric help, but also tells me I need to stop being so sensitive and not take our fights personally. He says I need to recover from our fights faster and not let myself get so distressed by them.

TL;DR: I agreed to fly across the world to see him, under the stipulation that he would not fight with me. At first he didn’t, but then started a fight (yelling/shouting/throwing things) over two dishes left in the sink. He apologized profusely, agreed not to fight with me again, but then started another (more minor) fight a week later. The fights emotionally exhaust me, distracting me from my studies. As a result, I’ve had to ask for multiple deadline extensions and file for an incomplete grade, meaning I will miss christmas break and instead need to study over the holidays so I don’t fail out of my graduate program.

I sent you some pics of my daily life. One in overalls from my solo Thanxgiving walk. And Included pics of a huge temple I visit. One day ill take you and show off the 15' long woman. 

IDK how long you’ll be away, &it breaks my heart. So I decided to share the mundane and interesting days, ,to keep our lives entwined some how. hoping it reminds you that youre loved &respected. No doubt nor regret.

Ya know how i like to sail choppy waters, so get your sea legs on to tackle an adventure. I’ve capitalized on Phoenix and started 30-min coffee dates—chill out. Just platonically. 
It’s a low-risk way to bring in $$. They pay $120 for 1/2 HR, im kind of, giving them false hope in a2nd shot of more then just a strong espresso. But they don't.

 Im marketing my natural skill of listening, &they pay in for a spotlight seat of myattention. One said I'm a MommyDom—crazy, I know, but harmless. All ive said is true. Ppl just want to be heard. I listen to guys confess their secrets. Offering only understanding and friendship.

 Don't worry about my heart. I’m content alone, focusing on me. I don’t have energy to spend on anyone else anyway. I'm reserving what I have left, saving it for a rainy day, when we can finally restart and rebuild. 

Dont trust rob! He lied& robbed my time& trust. I called him out, infiltrated a plan, showed him not to mess with me by being welcome into his house. His mother was so sweet, while he hid in his room. 
So disappointed, Hes only after the clarity i can connent him to. Now that's over. Another reminder that drugs ruin everything. 

I got a new camera as a gift &have been learning, I miss our late night photo shoots. No one is as creative, no one sees the things we do, when we are making together. 

 Dre and Pasha were happy to see you. Call them 2x/week; itll help you feel less alone i think. 
Some say I should move on, but FUCK them. I hope you won't, I still think of you daily. You're still in my life. 
 I'm at the 3-month rehab across the street from before, I didn't want to at first, but now I’m thinking to stay for a year? Idk.... With my own room I can fuel the 'badGirl in Christ rehab' repitour. Just an idea. I don't wanna lose anymore. 

Try &feel my heart beat with yours in the same tune. I’m loyal, stubborn and motivated in being true. 
I love you, baby.
&my answer is still, “I do.”

There are 2 restaurants at the hotel, the first is Ipe, here you have the buffet breakfast included in your stay, they also offer buffet lunch and dinner options. Ala carte is also available (we typically ate lunch by the pool). The second restaurant is Y Restaurant which is more elevated and you can have a tasting here (9 courses) or prix fixe which we did (composed of appetizer, main course and dessert). There is also one bar which had live music in the evening.

Breakfast: The breakfast buffet was truly incredible, the amount of options was amazing, and it all tastes good! You can also order coffee and a couple of egg dishes. I wish I had a bigger appetite so I can taste everything. Everything is clean, food is fresh and refilled quickly. There are multiple fresh juice options, also tastings for fermented coffee, lots of typical breakfast options but also local flavors as well.

Lunch: We typically had lunch by the pool, we had burgers, pizza, fish and chips, just simple meals that were good. No complaints. We loved getting the coconut water by the pool it was so tasty! 

Bar: I don’t drink and though there are a couple non alcoholic drinks they are not quite inventive and pricey. However if you ask the bartenders to make you something you will get a great drink and they will charge more reasonably (in line with juices). My sister had cocktails and said they were all very good, they also came in cute little bird glasses. 

Dinner: Dinner at the buffet was again surprisingly good. There is steak, fish, a plethora of salads and desserts. I wouldn’t even bother with the ala carte cause it’s nice to try all the differently options at the buffet. The steak was better than I had at the Four Seasons in Buenos Aires, so that’s saying something. Dinner at Y Restaurant was even better. We came around 6pm and it was pretty slow (I wish more people were there to have a more lively atmosphere). You are invited in the bar for a welcome
drink. The dishes were presented so uniquely and I had to say everything was amazing. You’d think a hotel in such a remote location would maybe have some faults but this was a real fine dining experience. The crab was so delicious, I had the beef braised in a clay pot, wow tender and melts in your mouth. My sister had fish with mushrooms, also amazing, especially the crispy mushrooms. Prices were all resonable for the quality!

Daily STOCHASTIC RSI is nearly rock bottom in oversold territory. It's about ready to make an upwards move in my opinion. Big volume could be incoming and drive us up.

1hey5q9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hey5q9/a_full_human_breakfast/,A Full Human Breakfast,"There are very few universal constants. With worlds occupied by widely varying life forms it might seem to an outsider that nothing among all species would ever be similar, but they do exist. One of those constants that span all species is known by many different names and practiced in many, many different ways. As the local star to each occupied planet rises, and the sapient species greet the new day, the first thing all of them want to do is eat. 

My own species, The Quethis, enjoy a plain gelatin made from sea grass, with a light fruit topping at dawn. We call this meal Gegistrat, bright meal, and it has been a part of our culture as far back as any can remember. The morning light casts it's colorful hues through the gelatin and stimulating our senses, while the fruit topping chases away the cobwebs of sleep. 

Thixtos prefer a light meal in the morning consisting of fallen fruits and fresh vegetables. Called Hillioute, or sunfeast, everything is eaten raw and preferably in the open air where the warmth of their stars can be felt on their skin. As a cold blooded species it makes sense. 

Regoudan prefer a wide variety of baked goods, carefully prepared during the long nights on their homeworld. St'afachilt, or Star Rise, is a family event where everyone partakes of all manner of breads and pastries while planning out the day. Often the meal takes place under a massive window to observe the star as it comes up. 

Erbendass take the opportunity to clean out their larders. Animals that don't age well are consumed whole as their stars just begin to appear over the horizon and any that remain once the star crests the horizon are set free. It's their way of giving back to the planets that have sustained them and keeping the cycle of life turning. 

Then there are the Humans. 

Long ago, many humans practiced eating smaller portions for what they call breakfast. A fruit known as an avocado, mashed on toast and lightly seasoned, was considered a luxury. Eggs and cured meats with pancakes was considered a morning staple of farmers and truck drivers. Steak and eggs, fried potatoes with onions, even leftover pizza was considered a good breakfast for some, but one of their nation's had long ago sowed the seeds of what a human breakfast would become. 

Bacon fried crisp, sausages cooked until the casing split, eggs cooked however the human wanted them, this would have sufficed for a majority of races, but not the humans. Beans on toast, a leftover from their Americans during one of their world wars, grilled red fruits known as tomatoes, fried fungus and lastly toasted bread rounded out this monstrous meal. The sheer volume of calories would have been enough to question their sanity, all packed on a plate and given the innocent name ""A Full English"". 

If only it had ended there. 

Once they knew they were not alone in the cosmos they came together as a species. There was a period of violence as is common, but the clashing of their cultures brought forth a united people, stronger together than believed possible. It also led to the creation of ""The Full Human"", a breakfast that even the most well fed of species would have dropped a fork and fled from. 

Beans on toast, the relic of their world war survived to make it on their plates, but with the addition of a boiled tree sap, either from a maple or a birch. The sausages, of which there were a wide variety, were replaced with chorizo or longanisa and added to scrambled eggs with a side of bacon. Due to cultural, religious, or dietary philosophy, the meats could be replaced with grilled vegetables and fruits depending on who was cooking or eating, but that didn't do anything to dismiss our caution. Grilled tomatoes and fried mushrooms would find themselves in company with grilled onion and fried garlic chips, even sliced radishes with butter on crostini found their way into breakfast, but that wasn't the end of it.

 With all of that, the humans just had to add one last touch, something that would break even the most stalwart of species. Introduced to us as ""Ranchero"", it was a vibrant red sauce they seemed to enjoy on everything. We would soon learn that like every human is subtly different, so are their names for hot sauce, and all of them are addicted to it. 

Eventually, their massive breakfasts were just accepted as part of their culture topped off with several cups of coffee or tea which they claimed they needed to wake up in the morning. As they grew more accustomed to us, we began to notice more about them and why they consumed so much at breakfast. For every calorie consumed, the humans seemed to leap forward in physical ability and intelligence. For every gram of caffine and capsicum, they moved faster, were more mentally acute, and able to envision ideas that we had never considered before making them reality before our eyes. 

After a few decades, some of us began to embrace their foods as well, not so much in size, but in variety. Avocado toast has become popular among the Thixtos due to its relative inexpense. Pain au chocolat and baklava are considered essential to the Regoudan. Erbendass have begun to embrace sausages over live prey. Even my species have become accustomed to the human breakfast where Beans on Toast has become increasingly popular. 

While a few species have tried to consume a Full Human Breakfast, the results of such gluttony have varied. Those few, brave enough to succeed have mentioned something far larger exists in the human diet. Spoken about in wispers and unfathomable to most species, the humans openly admit that they do exist, and do so with absolute pride; going as far as admitting that very few humans have ever been able to finish these Titanic meals. Although I would never dare to partake, I think I would like to see them for myself one day.

Whereas when I matched with someone in a European country that girl came to meet me and she had to travel in a train for an hour and then I was late and made her wait for another hour and she was just so humble about it,

After getting done with our coffee and desserts I paid the bill while she kept insisting that we should dutch and after I paid it she just couldn’t stop blushing and kept telling me how sweet I was to do that in the first meeting, the bill was hardly 2000 Indian rupees,

I went out with a influencer in my city in Mumbai and she ordered food and drinks without giving a thought of how expensive it would be and the bill was more than 10k and she was looking at my face when the bill came, I’m not saying that she should pay but it just looked very shameless 

Coming back to the girl I was with in Austria,

I asked her if she would like to walk around with me and have a few beers later and she agreed and we spent the evening together talking about each others cultural differences and walking around popular sights and she bought a pizza for us and paid for it and mentioned that she would like to pay for it because I was being a gentleman

It was just one day but it was an experience of a lifetime for me, that woman looked prettier than 90% of the woman I’ve come across here,
Was so understanding, polite and intelligent.

Now why am I talking about this here is because my family and my work is in Mumbai and I cant shift to another country and I’ve heard a lot about how difficult it is for people from white countries to live here

I got it from a good plant nursery and it looked great! Large and bushy. I took it home and planted it in the tank. It was in a slightly shaded corner, humidity was around 50%, temps were 70-75F, and it got watered when the soil around it was starting to get dry. The soil it was in was the joshes frogs tropical bio bedding (4” with a 3” drainage layer)

It looked bad after a month, all the leaves died and basically fell off (I gently moved them and they just fell off) it has 1-3 new fronds (I think that’s what they are called) coming in. I then moved it out of the tank as I needed to remove everything to fix a leak and it got potted in the pot above, it’s currently in regular topsoil and the joshes frogs mix around the roots and seems to be doing much better. Currently around 73F with 30-40% humidity where it currently is. Is has indirect sunlight from a nearby window.

When I put it back in my geckos tank should I move it to a place with more light? (Nicrew gen 2 grow light) Is it too cold for it?

Does it need some form of fertilizer? Because it’s for my lizard I cannot use commercial chemical fertilizer however I should be safe using stuff like eggshells and used coffee grounds or other non chemical ways of adding nutrients to the soil

And if motorcycling isn’t your thing, no worries—road trips in the car with great conversation, cozy diners, and discovering hidden gems are just as special to me.

If your idea of fun includes chasing golden-hour sunsets, savoring roadside pie, and creating unforgettable memories, let’s connect. I’m looking for someone who values shared experiences, whether it’s exploring new places or appreciating the beauty of the everyday.

Let’s take it one adventure at a time and see where the road leads us. Tell me about your favorite scenic spot or a place you’ve always wanted to explore—I’d love to hear about it.

1hexohf,https://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1hexohf/daily_planet_proposed_tv_series/,"""Daily Planet"" - proposed TV series","One of the other posts asked what a proposal for a HBO/Max series featuring the Daily Planet would be.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1hebb1h/how\_would\_you\_pitch\_a\_daily\_planet\_hbo\_series\_set/?sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/superman/comments/1hebb1h/how_would_you_pitch_a_daily_planet_hbo_series_set/?sort=new)

For whatever reason I couldn't put in my proposal, so I'm putting it here.

It should be noted that the series really would focus on the Daily Planet staff, with superheroes like Superman and Supergirl only being referenced in conversation and rarely seen if at all.

**""DAILY PLANET""**

This is a lighthearted series about life in the Daily Planet, one of the premiere newspapers in the DC Universe, struggling to survive in a world that has moved from print to multimedia content.

Think ""Lou Grant"" or ""The Newsroom"" but with the same comedic tone as ""The Office"".

The show takes place primarily in *""The Bullpen""*, where the Planet's top reporters cover the events of both Metropolis and the world.  This is an open-area office floor with cubicles and a central meeting area.  Additional scenes will take place in the streaming studio adjacent to the Bullpen, and in offices along the outside walls.  Some other scenes will take place in a place called ""Bibbo's"", which is a restaurant and bar in Hobb's Bay.

**Main Characters**

**Perry White** is the editor-in-chief.  He's a no-nonsense old school newspaper editor who started out as a child delivering newspapers and worked his way to being the editor.  He is interested in the next story and pushes his reporters to provide content.  His favorite exclamation is ""Great Caesar's Ghost"", which he says in lieu of any kind of swearing.  He used to smoke cigars, but he had to quit years ago.

**Ron Troupe** is an up-and-coming reporter.  Perry sees much of himself in Ron, which is why he's moved from the City desk to politics.  Ron always sees a story and he's not afraid to go get it himself.

**Jimmy Olson** is the Planet's boyish multimedia photographer and videographer.  Like Perry in his childhood years, Jimmy started at a young age taking pictures and selling them to the Planet.  He would often get pictures of Superman that most seasoned photographers couldn't.  He's goofy and young and sometimes immature, but he is up with all the trends.  He's also one of the secret owners of the Daily Planet due to his family's connection to Lex Luthor's.  This is why Perry can't fire Jimmy, no matter how much he threatens to.  His best friends are Lois Lane, Clark Kent, and Superman.  He also has a crush on Superman's cousin.

**Cat Grant** is the Planet's gossip/entertainment/lifestyles reporter.  She's a social gadfly with the inside scoop on anything related to the social scene.  She knows what's going on with politicians and actors and actresses.  But despite her bubbly diva appearance, she's really a troubled single mother struggling to raise her young son.  She has a crush on Clark Kent and it annoys her to no extent that he's with Lois Lane.  She also has a particular hatred on Superman's cousin, especially after Supergirl once pointed out Cat's ""enhancements"".

**Steve Lombard** is the Planet's sports reporter.  A former football quarterback, Steve is a macho ""alpha"" male who enjoys making fun of nerdy guys like Clark Kent.  He's quick with football comparisons, even when the subject is about other sports like basketball or baseball.  He thinks Superman is a great guy, though, and compares him to a quarterback like he used to be. He's slightly out-of-shape and wears a toupee.

**Lana Lang** is the Planet's newest online editor.  Like Clark Kent, she came from Smallville.  But she's not a reporter.  Rather, she's involved with the Planet's website.  She has hopes of creating a streaming service but is hindered by the lack of available content.  She's Clark Kent's high school girlfriend and friends with both Clark and Lois.

**Lois Lane** is the Daily Planet's star reporter.  A multiple Pulitzer winner, Lois will often find stories that get her the front page exclusive.  Most of the time it involves Superman.  She's been in a stable relationship with her fellow reporter, Clark Kent, even though she has also been romantically linked to Superman.  She's also a bad speller, with the other staff members often correcting her, because she refuses to use autocorrect (she claims it is a Lexcorp app designed to censor her articles).

**Secondary Characters**

**Clark Kent** is the Daily Planet's other star reporter, although not seen as often as the others as he's always finding ""scoops"" which his girlfriend Lois helps write and become the headline.  Aside from Lois and Lana, nobody else knows that Clark Kent is really Superman.  He is often ducking out in the supply closet, which leads Steve to question why he spends so much time in there.

**Bo ""Bibbo""** **Bibbowski** is a former dock worker and owner of ""Bibbo's"", where the Daily Planet staff can often be seen at when they're not at work.  The bar used to be called the ""Ace o' Clubs"", but Bibbo bought it after winning the lottery and turned it into a decent bar and restaurant.  He considers himself Superman's best pal and is always pointing out that he helped Superman one time against a space bounty hunter named Lobo.

**Lex Luthor** is the CEO of Lexcorp, the largest and most powerful corporation in Metropolis.  He often complains about the news articles about anything connected to his business or to himself.  He always threatens to buy out the paper or to sue them into bankruptcy, but Perry knows he really can't because of an agreement Lex made with Jimmy.

**Morgan Edge** is the owner of WGBS, the city's premiere TV station and the Planet's chief online rival for news.  He's a shark always looking to buy out the Planet's reporters.  He had bought out Planet's rival newspaper, the Daily Star, when he was younger and transformed it into his TV station.

**Franklin Stern** is the official publisher for the Daily Planet, although he is only the co-owner of the paper (with Jimmy Olson being the secret partner).  He is the one responsible for bringing Lana Lang to Metropolis and transitioning the paper towards a multimedia service.  He's around the same age as Perry.  He's obsessed with the bottom line.

**Kara Danvers** is an intern for the Daily Planet working for Lana Lang.  She's often the one getting coffee for the reporters, which leads to some abrasive contacts with Cat Grant.  Aside from Lois, Lana, and Clark, nobody else knows Kara is really Supergirl.

------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become a popular dental procedure, and for good reason. Many individuals seek out this treatment to achieve a brighter smile, which can significantly impact their confidence and overall appearance. With various options available ranging from professional treatments to at-home kits, you might wonder about the real before and after results that teeth whitening can provide.

### Understanding Teeth Whitening Treatments

Before diving into the results, it's essential to understand the types of teeth whitening available. Here are some common options:

- **In-office whitening:** This procedure is performed by a dental professional. It typically uses stronger bleaching agents than at-home kits, yielding faster and more noticeable results.
- **At-home whitening kits:** These often include whitening strips or gel that you can apply to your teeth at home. While effective, they typically take longer to show results compared to in-office treatments.
- **Whitening toothpaste:** These contain mild abrasives and chemical agents that help remove surface stains. However, they may not significantly alter the color of your teeth.

### Before and After: Real Results You Can Expect

Many people are curious about the actual impact of teeth whitening and what they can achieve with these treatments. Here are some notable before and after results that individuals report:

- **Enhanced Smile Aesthetic:** Numerous patients report that their smiles look brighter and more youthful after treatment. This aesthetic enhancement often leads to increased self-esteem.

### Factors Influencing Results

Not all teeth whitening results are the same. Several factors can influence the effectiveness of the treatments:

- **The Current Shade of Teeth:** Individuals with intrinsic stains (those that are within the tooth structure) may find that they achieve different results than those with extrinsic stains.
- **Age:** Younger individuals may see quicker results due to healthier enamel, while older individuals may have more wear and tear on their enamel, affecting the outcome.
- **Dental Health:** Good dental hygiene and the absence of cavities or gum disease can contribute to better whitening results.

### Maintaining Your Whitened Smile

Once you've achieved your desired shade, it's vital to maintain those results. Consider the following tips:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Consult a Dentist**
Before starting any teeth whitening process, consulting your dentist is essential. They can evaluate your oral health and recommend suitable options.

- **Read Product Labels**
Whether you're choosing a professional kit or an over-the-counter product, always read the ingredients and instructions. Products with the American Dental Association (ADA) seal of approval are typically safer.

- **Avoid Overuse**
Using whitening products too frequently can lead to tooth sensitivity and enamel erosion. Stick to recommended usage guidelines to maintain your oral health.


### Enhancing Results with Proper Care

Once you've whitened your teeth, you'll want to keep them looking bright. Here are strategies to help maintain your results:

- **Maintain Good Oral Hygiene**
Brush your teeth twice daily and floss regularly. Using whitening toothpaste can help prolong your results.

- **Watch Your Diet**
Certain foods and drinks can stain your teeth, such as coffee, tea, red wine, and berries. Limiting these can significantly help maintain your bright smile.

- **Schedule Regular Dental Checkups**
Regular visits to the dentist can help keep the teeth in optimal condition and catch any dental issues early.


### Expectations and Realistic Outcomes

It's essential to have realistic expectations for your teeth whitening results. Here are some points to keep in mind:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Varied Results**
Everyone's teeth respond differently to whitening agents. Factors like tooth color, stains, and overall dental health can affect the outcome.

- **Duration of Results**
Results can last from a few months to several years, depending on your oral care routine and lifestyle habits. Regular touch-ups may be necessary to maintain brightness.

- **Temporary Sensitivity**
Some individuals experience sensitivity during and after the whitening process. If sensitivity occurs, it typically resolves quickly. Reducing usage can help minimize discomfort.


### Final Tips for Lasting Teeth Whitening

To ensure the longevity of your teeth whitening results, consider these final tips:

- **Hydrate**
Drinking plenty of water helps rinse away food particles and bacteria, contributing to overall oral health.

- **Consider Touch-Up Treatments**
After initial whitening, some people find touch-up treatments every few months help keep their smile vibrant.

- **Be Cautious with Quick Fixes**
While instant solutions can be tempting, they might be unsafe or less effective. Always prioritize safety over speed.


Achieving a bright, white smile doesn't have to be a complicated process. By following safe methods and maintaining proper care, you can enjoy lasting results that enhance your appearance and boost your confidence.

The real before-and-after results are testament to the effectiveness of various whitening methods, showcasing a stunning difference that can elevate both personal and professional interactions.

I was a straight A student uptill 10th grade. At this point in my life, my father was living separately and my mom wasn't really involved in my life so I was kinda on my own. However, my life was good- I had many friends and my teachers appreciated me. Cut to eleventh grade, my father got laid off from his job and shifted to our place and he was the definition of a failure. He had bad habits-would eat constantly after every hour, was addicted to coffee(drank it after every 30 minutes), smoked after every 15 minutes, wasn't motivated to do anything, would not step out of the house, etc. In short he influenced me and slowly I started to turn out like him. I started scoring less and stopped going out. This happened gradually and before I could realise it, I found myself in a deep pit.

All my friends had slowly left me, I had become overweight and went from getting straight A's to C's and D's. Slowly, all the love that I had for my father turned into hate, resentment and frustration. Meanwhile, my mother is a hot mess, always over analysing everything, getting upset for no reason, having severe anxiety, etc. She is also the least bothered about me. I think she has a mental condition but sure as hell isn't going to get it checked out and no one questions it as she is the sole bread earner in the family.

Meanwhile, my father says that he never did anything wrong when he LITERALLY told me that I was worthless and wouldn't amount to anything. All my peers, even those who weren't good at studying, got into a bachelor's program meanwhile here I am, stuck. My useless father told me that I wasn't particularly good at anything and should give up even trying to do anything worthwhile. I'm 18 and a mess right now, I'm so utterly lost and depressed...I don't know what to do, I feel like killing myself..I'm not worth anything, there's no point  in living anymore. Since I have toxic parents and no friends, I have turned to reddit to vent out my frustration..should I end all my suffering? No one knows that I was trying to step off a ledge 4 hours ago..now I feel like I should execute this plan as I'm done with life.

1hex8uj,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1hex8uj/getting_out_of_bed/,Getting out of bed,"Hi, I've searched the history of this sub and found that the question of how to get out of bed has come up before. But with technology always changing, I'm here to bring it up again (on behalf of myself, but please feel free to add your own details in comments if you're struggling with this too).

When I wake up in the morning, I feel an overwhelming sense of dread. It hasn't always been this way. I'd say the dread started about a month ago, following feeling intense sadness and overwhelm in the mornings after my cat died two months ago. Before that, I'd still have a hard time with the transition of being in bed to getting up but wouldn't have intense feelings about it.

The intense feelings about getting up in the morning (whether it's dread, sadness, despair, or outright anger) tend to increase when stressors in my life increase. For example, my dad died some years ago and getting out of bed became a huge challenge then, but that was 2020 and the world was more lenient that year. This time, life is carrying on and I'm having this emotional experience but still need to show up for work and also just don't want to feel so awful about getting up. It's like, rather than just being able to focus on grieving my cat's death and the changes to my routine that have come with that, now I have all these extra feelings of dread every morning about just getting up. Because it's turned into a source of stress itself. 

It's to the point I'm considering talking with my health care team about stopping my anxiety medication, because before I started that, something in my brain was hardwired differently around transitions and I simply had to start the next thing when I finished one thing. I've also been wondering if the anxiety diagnosis is even correct, but that's a different conversation. Anyways, I know nobody can give medical advice but I'm adding this info for context.

I've tried multiple alarms, different sounds on the alarms, alarm across the room, alarm in a different room, alarm that slowly brightens the room. Each of these used to work but none of them do anymore. I just lay in bed until they automatically turn off, and usually fall back asleep as they're still chiming. Same with a mission alarm clock. I tried one and found that it, too, will auto-shut off after 30 minutes if the mission isn't completed.

I've ordered a programmable coffee maker that arrives today. I was thinking of setting it up in the kitchen but now I might just set it up next to my bed to auto brew each morning. After reading some other posts this seems like a good idea. I'm looking at buying a SAD lamp to put over my bed. Maybe in tandem with the coffee maker this will help.

Does anyone have advice for how to make mornings gentler? Or know from experience that it gets better? Do I just need to wait it out?

Author: Simulacrum (my pseudonym)

PS: I'm sorry for my bad english. The story below.

It's been a year since I witnessed the horror and, since then, fortunately I've continued to see everyday things, without supernatural events generating a madness that I never want to experience again. Last year, I moved to Kingston Upon Thames, one of the districts of Greater London, to live in the house that belonged to Charlotte Wilkins, an elderly sick woman. She was apparently very nice and loved to talk. She rejected the formality when I initially called her “Mrs. Wilkins”, and asked me to just call her Charlotte. On my first day living in the house, Charlotte and I talked for about 15 minutes. She told me that she had come to terms with her imminent death and that she would like to live out the short time she had left in her best friend's house.

Charlotte didn't have any children, so it wasn't a difficult decision to sell the house that had just been renovated, and as I was looking for a place to live, I didn't hesitate when I saw the “for sale” sign on the property and immediately acted to buy it. As she has no descendants and doesn't have close contact with her family, Charlotte wanted to leave some of her personal belongings with me, and told me she would be very grateful if I would take them. Considering that Charlotte was in very poor health and was getting closer and closer to death, I had a certain compassion and didn't refuse her request. So I got some paintings and other objects that were on the front of the house. Charlotte told me that she liked to travel and that Scotland was her favorite destination.

— It was in Scotland that I found a relatively rare and very special book — she said —, but I don't remember where I put it. If you find it, you don't have to come to me to give it to me, you know I won't live long, so keep it.

I just nodded. Outside, a woman was waiting in a car: she was, according to Charlotte, her best friend. The elderly woman thanked me for agreeing to take her personal belongings, got into the car where her friend was waiting in the driver's seat, and the two drove off. During our conversation, Charlotte sometimes let slip, in a subtle way, that she didn't like her family, so I got the impression that she had sold the house not because she wanted to live out her last days with her friend, but because she would

rather the house remained with a stranger than belong to relatives when the time came for her to pass away. I suspected that this was the main reason why the house was sold to me for so much less than it was actually worth. She was in a hurry to sell the house before death came for her and allowed relatives to enjoy her estate. I remember it was Saturday when I woke up in my new home, had coffee and then took the opportunity to do some cleaning and found a pair of pink shoes under the bed. I looked closely at the two objects, which, being so simple and delicate, led me to the conclusion that they weren't exactly ordinary shoes: they were ballerina shoes. I deduced that the shoes might be Charlotte's, and that they were part of the objects she had given me, but as I had no interest in them, I put them away in a corner of one of the cupboards in the house. As for the house, it's a simple but beautiful place: it has a hedge, a gable roof that makes up the attic and rustic walls with a slightly yellowish white color reminiscent of a sunny day.

I was also enchanted by the garden on the front. It wasn't a large garden, but there was plenty of space for me to spend time. The flowers in the garden varied in color, fragrance, size, texture and shape. The garden also had an elongated oak bench. What I'm about to say may seem exaggerated, but such was my fascination with the garden that I acquired a kind of addiction to it: the flowers and the birds that landed there intoxicated me. Some of the works of art scattered around the garden expressed a touching beauty, others caused discomfort: there were several small gray statues 40 centimeters high. The statues depicted everything from a mother holding a baby to a woman dressed as a ballerina, and behind this woman was another statue: that of a hideous figure that looked more like a cosmic entity.

The neighbors greeted me, welcomed me and didn't mind the hideous statues in the garden, which seemed invisible to them. During the first six days in the house, I spent time in the garden, on the oak bench, drinking tea, reading a book, or just observing everything in it, but on the seventh day things happened that I'll never forget. On the same Saturday that I found the ballerina shoes, exactly a week after moving into the property, Charlotte came to visit me almost in the evening. She had said that she was feeling her life slipping away sooner than she had imagined, and that she would like to contemplate the garden she loved so much alone for the last time. I was moved by her request and left her there, alone, just as she wanted. About five minutes passed and she went back into the house. To give her a little comfort, I told her that I would

take good care of the garden. She smiled, thanked me and drove off with her friend who, once again, hadn't got out of the car. A few minutes later, I was alone in the garden.

What was supposed to be a moment of ecstasy became a mishmash of bad and sad feelings strangely followed by uplifting ones. My body and mind felt as light as a feather, and slowly my body began to move away from the grass. I realized that I was levitating, and looking down, I saw that my feet were about 30 centimetres above the grass. The flora and birds that landed there began to liquefy and blend together like a watercolor of various colors, and I was confused by this madness because I had a mixed feeling of agony and delight. In the middle of this mix, a child appeared in the watercolor garden, running and smiling with radiant happiness. To my surprise, that child was me... I mean, in that beautifully hideous garden I saw myself as a child, showing a naive, childlike happiness. All this psychedelic madness was frightening and beautiful.

Gradually, the situation normalized, the watercolor crumbled, and what had previously liquefied became solid again, and as if coming out of a trance, I felt more awake and the garden became what it was again. When the terrifying psychedelia ended, I realized that I was exactly in the center of the garden, and my body was facing the house. Little by little, the house was surrounded by a dense white mist, but a little yellowish, like the color of the walls. A sweet, feminine voice from inside the house told me not to be afraid. Whoever was inside, observing the fairytale madness I was going through, concluded the obvious: I was afraid. And although I still couldn't see clearly because of the fog, I saw that there was a woman at the living room window, whose door led out onto the garden. It was still a sunny afternoon, but twilight was gradually approaching, and a black cloud appeared near the roof of the house. The mysterious cloud soon dissipated, revealing what looked like a piece of outer space in a large dark circle that I later guessed was a portal. A strong wind hit the living room door, blowing it open.

I thought the situation couldn't get any weirder, as I thought the madness of the place had reached its peak, but I was wrong. The sneakers I'd kept in a cupboard came

moving out, side by side. Soon the shoes arrived in the garden and positioned themselves so that only their tips touched the ground, they moved harmoniously in all directions, and I understood that these simple objects were performing a dance. The impression I got was that an invisible body was dancing ballet and that only the sneakers could be seen moving in that dance, again causing me a mixed feeling, this time of unease and admiration. Yes, I was admiring that moment, even though the darkness of fear arose in my core, because that's what the unknown causes: a disquieting fear, because I didn't know who was wearing the sneakers.

I had my back to the fence and tried to turn around to run and escape, but some invisible force made my body immobile - I could only speak and move my eyes. A crystal-clear horror flashed before my eyes as the sneakers stopped performing dance moves and started taking steps, walking normally, and they came towards me. The sneakers came closer and touched my bare feet. I felt like I was being hugged and heard the sweet, feminine voice again:

— It's me, Albert, it's me... You knew me, but my voice was different, it was weaker, because I didn't have the strength to go on living.

Astonished, I said:

— I don't know who you are. In fact, there's no way of knowing who you are because I can't see you, you're invisible to me. And how do you know my name?

— I'm Charlotte, Albert.

— Charlotte? The woman who sold me the house? - I asked suspiciously. - Well, your voice is different from Charlotte's, your voice is youthful and with a certain vigor, and not a senile and debilitated voice like hers.

The woman moved away at a distance of about two meters from me and suddenly became visible, and I could finally see her: she was a young woman who appeared to be about 25 years old, with black hair, blue eyes and a slender body. She was wearing a set of items that are part of a ballerina's wardrobe: a hairnet, tights, a skirt with a waistband, stockings and, of course, her sneakers. She said:

— When I was young, I had the desire to be a ballerina. In fact, I almost succeeded in fulfilling my wish, but life takes different turns from what people plan.

— I'm sorry, Charlotte, but why are you telling me this?

— For a long time, I've been spreading my anger in this garden, brooding over having my wish destroyed when I gave up ballet because of an accident, anger also caused by other unfulfilled wishes. This is the garden of inert desires, you see.

At that moment, I assumed that there might be an explanation for the child self appearing in the garden. I had several wishes as a child, but of those wishes, there was a special one, which unfortunately I couldn't fulfill.

— That smiling child you saw running around this garden was your wish — Charlotte explained. — As a child, you wanted to have a happy childhood, to be a happy child, but that wasn't possible because of your narcissistic mother.

She was right. I didn't know how Charlotte found out that I had a difficult childhood and, in truth, it didn't matter how this grim fragment of my life had come to her attention. I could understand, however, that the garden seemed to concentrate some of my unfulfilled desires, because while Charlotte... I mean, while the young version of Charlotte was talking, images of my desires that, for various reasons, never came to fruition were appearing all around me, like projects that I had envisioned and never got off the ground.

— A strong unfulfilled desire doesn't die, it becomes a dying psychic energy full of anger and anguish — explained Charlotte. — I'm dying, Albert, you know... You saw me weak when you bought the house. I, young Charlotte, am the version who had wishes for the future, but when you bought the house, you met the Charlotte who abandoned her own wishes and dumped them in this garden.

\- I'm really sorry, Charlotte, I hope you find peace when...

\- When I die? — she interrupted me.

— When I leave — I replied.

For a moment, there was silence between us. We looked at each other like two miserable people who shared the same misfortune: our destinies built on the frustration of desires that didn't develop, that only inhabited the mind.

— Why do some statues depict such beautiful things and others cause disquiet and chills? - I asked.

— These little statues, Albert, are my most intense desires, which, as you already know, have not come true. Wishes that cause restlessness and chills are also part of peaceful people, but there's a difference between just wishing for something bad and putting it into practice. In this garden, unfulfilled wishes become figurines that will soon adorn the house of the Goddess. I don't know if you've noticed, but since you moved here, a statuette of a smiling little boy has appeared in that corner — she said, pointing his finger to where the statuette he described was. — Remember when I told you that this is the garden of inert desires?

— Of course, now it makes sense, inert desires like statues.

— Exactly.

— Looking at the statues, I assume that you have a mind that's split into two sides: a beautiful side, and a dark side, very dark.

— That statuette of a mother holding a baby... - she sighed, looking sad. - I would have liked to have had children, but I'm sterile.

— Again, I'm sorry — I sympathized. — But among all the gloomy statues, I'd like you to explain that one... That monstrous figure behind the ballerina.

Charlotte looked at the abomination, smiled mischievously, and gave me an answer that would reverberate for the rest of my existence, for I would never forget that statuette and the dark meaning that Charlotte was about to reveal to me.

— She is the Goddess. She is Anguish. She is the Mother of Desires, those desires that cannot fight back. The inert desires like statuettes are still furious because they haven't accessed reality, and the Goddess is the one who brings the wind of encouragement, that same wind you feel when you levitate, and she also brings that wind to the desires that, by inertia, can be nothing more than desires unfulfilled by their wishers.

— And what will happen now? — I asked, apprehensive and afraid of what she would say.

— I'm going to die soon, Albert, and in order to leave in peace, I need the Goddess to do something for me. My pleas have already been made, the words have already been spoken.

The door to the room opened, and out of the room came an old and man with a furrowed brow whom I had never seen before. He came into the garden, confused and wondering how he had ended up there. He was startled to see the black portal and tried to run away from the house, but the same invisible force that had left me immobile also acted on him. Unable to move, he shouted for help, hoping that the neighbors would hear him, but no one did: everything that was happening around the house and garden was imperceptible from the outside. I could hear the noise of cars and people walking and talking near the house, but they went about their business as usual. In a flash, the man's voice disappeared, he was struck by a sudden dumbness. I asked Charlotte who he was. The young woman, with a wicked smile on her lips once again, told me that the man had prevented her from fulfilling a great desire. With an expression of distress in his eyes, the old man listened to Charlotte like someone carrying the guilt of a reckless past.

— See that gentleman over there, Albert? A drunk who ran me over, driving completely drunk, crushing my left leg and preventing me from becoming a dancer, rendering inert such a deep desire that I possessed. As you always saw me in a long dress, you didn't see my prosthesis and you didn't realize that I have an amputated leg. But the Goddess will help me leave in peace. She is ready to grace us with her presence.

The hideous figure that Charlotte called the Goddess came flying out of the portal and landed in the garden. It was a creature about three and a half meters tall, with large butterfly wings, but armored, and these wings were black with metallic blue edges. Its body was elongated and, in a way, looked like a slug - more precisely, it was a pink, gelatinous mass that was quite flexible, wet and disgusting looking. Its huge mouth stretched vertically from just below its eyes to the beginning of its posterior extension, which appeared like a tail. On either side of the mouth were two long appendages, which looked more like thin pink tentacles that moved in a snakelike fashion - the tips of the appendages were rounded and flattened. Its sharp teeth lined up horizontally, and its equally pink tongue oozed a thick, yellowish goo. At the top, there were two short curved filaments above its two slightly protruding globular eyes. The eyes were filled with red and in each of them there was a large black dot in the center

that moved according to the direction in which the creature looked. At the bottom of the monster was a tail with five segments. From the fifth segment, the tail tapered until it split into two filaments, and at the tip of each filament was a black claw slightly less curved than a hawk's claws.

The old man who had run over Charlotte was attacked by the two claws, which pierced both sides of his chest, in the rib area. The two filaments lifted the old man by means of the claws embedded in his ribs and carried him into the mouth of the Goddess. He was chewed up and I realized that his broken body had simply disappeared from the creature's mouth, leaving only traces of the man's blood in it. At that moment, I didn't know what to do when I saw that scene which, I'll tell you in the strongest terms, was the most terrifying thing I'd ever seen. Charlotte spoke again and I tried to ignore her, but I couldn't.

— I could have called the Goddess first, Albert, but I waited for you to buy the house and unconsciously pour your desires into the garden so that I could understand the Goddess' beautiful justice. I touched the statuette of the happy little boy, and I saw how your mother made you suffer. Wait for the right moment, and when you've spent enough time in the garden, say the right words. You'll finally be able to give your mother the end she deserves, she has to be torn apart. Just look behind one of the pictures I gave you. Eight months ago, I bought the house, but the disease came on aggressively, and I had to rush to sell the house, wait for you to settle in and then give you true justice. Between eight and nine months of attending the garden, that's enough for the Goddess to attend to you, and then you'll finally be able to invoke her. You only have a few figurines, you need more, and your wishes must be sincere.

I was getting weak and tired. Once again, my body became light, but the wind carried me towards the Goddess, and she, leaning down her gelatinous body, stared at me with her fearful eyes. Leaning closer and closer, the Goddess approached me, and I, levitating but still motionless, shifted my gaze to her open mouth and caught a glimpse of what seemed to be a portal inside that mouth. Through the portal I saw a mountainous region where there was a place with a large number of bones made up of shattered bones and also a broken body that was so unrecognizable that I could only conjecture that it was the old man who had been chewed up. At that point, there was nothing I could do but wait to see what the creature would do to me. To my relief, it suddenly moved away. The figurines began to rise from the grass and move through the air towards the circular, starry portal, where they entered to be taken to the abode of the butterfly-winged demon.

— The powerful Goddess is finally getting her due. The statuettes will adorn her ineffable home — explained Charlotte, with an expression of admiration for the monstrosity.

I was surprised by something rather symbolic and dark going into the circular portal through which the Goddess had emerged: the statuette of Charlotte, once represented as a young ballerina, now in its elderly version, completely naked, with a monstrous mouth on its belly and large butterfly wings on its back, which led me to assume that the statuettes of old Charlotte and the Goddess had merged. When all the figurines were no longer in the garden, the Goddess flew out and entered the circular, starry portal. The portal closed in a few seconds. Young Charlotte waved her right hand in a gesture of farewell and disappeared into the mist. “Now I can die in peace,” said a voice in my head. It was Charlotte's tired and senile voice. The wind that had been lifting me ceased and I fell to the grass. Dazed and tired, I focused my gaze for a few seconds on the reddish orange sky of the coming twilight. My body felt heavy, so I went straight to the living room and collapsed on the sofa, where I immediately closed my eyes to go to sleep. I woke up around 7:15 the next morning.

I know that if other people had experienced that horror, they would have left the house out of trauma and fear, but I decided to stay out of stubbornness, despite the fear of staying. Later that morning, I thought about removing all the objects Charlotte had given me from the house, and I began by taking a picture of a painting depicting three women, all wearing white dresses, standing in a vast area of vegetation where there was a mansion in the background. Above their heads was a blackened circle filled with stars. Behind the painting, I found a hole in the wall, where there was a book, most likely kept, or rather hidden, by Charlotte. It was a black-covered book with the title “Cosmic Magic”, and I noticed that there was a chapter in it called “The Invocation of the Mother of Desires”.

Out of curiosity, I read the chapter in the book with guidelines for invoking the Goddess, stating that she is asked to chew up and destroy those who have prevented the fulfillment of other people's wishes. The book explained that it is very different to fulfill one's desires in the right and just way and to fulfill them by deliberately harming

people. Those who intentionally or recklessly ruin wishes that can be fulfilled in the most peaceful way possible are targets for the Goddess — although each wish has a context for the Goddess to evaluate. Also according to the book, in 1591, three young witches from North Berwick, a town in Scotland, possessed manuscripts that not only revealed the existence of entities unknown to most of those involved in magic, but also instructions on how to invoke them. The manuscripts belonged to an Irish magician who lived in the far north of Ireland.

The three women sowed the desire to live peacefully, did not want to cause harm to others and did not want to be harassed; however, a group of ten men, who were not exactly sent by King James VI of Scotland; but, influenced by the monarch's attitude of having promoted fierce hunts for various witches, tried to capture them to be executed by them. These men slyly discovered that the witches resorted to harmless spells in order to have a successful crop and a bountiful harvest at any time of the year in the region where they lived. Even though these spells did no harm, the men considered them threats.

Confronting the men, the witches, using aggressive spells, managed to kill two of them. They didn't want to hurt or kill any more of the men, and warned them to leave, but they continued to attack them. Realizing that they needed much more than aggressive spells to defeat that hostile group, the women had no choice and, at the same time, with their voices in unison, they began to pronounce words from a strange language of alien origin spoken by a society of Celtic mystics whose members began meeting together from 1600 BC. The witches spoke the words of invocation like music: first in two-by-four time, then they spoke more quickly, in four-by-four time, with all the words being pronounced with their voices reaching a single musical note: B flat. Then the Mother of Desires emerged from the circular portal and chewed up all the men who had assaulted those women.

The book mentioned that the broken bodies of those men were taken to a place in Europe through a portal that appeared inside the creature's own mouth while it was chewing on them. This probably explains why the old man who ran over Charlotte wasn't exactly swallowed by the Goddess: considering the bones and the shattered body that I saw through the portal inside the creature's mouth when it had approached me, I assumed that the chewed-up old man was thrown into a kind of macabre open-air dump where the monster's victims are kept - the book didn't mention very specifically where this place is, it just pointed out that the chewed-up bodies were left in a mountainous region of Ireland because they didn't serve as food for the Goddess, as she didn't need to eat to survive. During that reading, I concluded that, logically, the painting Charlotte had left in the house was based on the three witches.

For the invocation of the Goddess to be successful, the book that had belonged to Charlotte recommended saying the words exactly as the witches did. The words, spoken in two different measures and on a single note, must be pronounced in an overgrown area, and this same place must be where the person who needs the Goddess has lived for at least eight to nine months, imbuing the place with memories and desires — just as Charlotte spent a lot of time in the garden, and just as the witches lived in the countryside. When I reached the lines in the book where the words to invoke the Goddess were, I immediately closed it and, a few hours later, burned it.

As I watched the book being consumed by the fire, I began to think back to when Charlotte had visited me on that dark Saturday, telling me that, to say goodbye to the garden she loved so much, she would like to see it for the last time - again, her friend was waiting for her in the car. I also remembered that, while she was alone in the garden, I was in the living room and could hear her uttering incomprehensible words. Nine months after the supernatural events, a woman, who appeared to be around 30 years old, came to my house and called me. I looked out of the window and recognized her: it was the woman who always stayed in the car, waiting for Charlotte when I talked to the elderly woman. It was early evening and this woman was wearing a black overcoat and had a string around her neck with a pendant, which I assumed was silver, in the shape of a pentagram. I opened the door to the living room and went towards her to ask why she was visiting, but when I got to the center of the garden, the woman, who was standing next to the hedge of my house, was in a hurry and said to me:

— You haven't invoked the Goddess to give your mother a proper end. You're weak, you're a disappointment.

And as soon as she had insulted me, she got into her car, drove off and I never saw her again.",1,1734282597.0,nosleep,0,0.67,False

It had been five months since they received the message from the Halcyon colony, and Alia had begun to worry. James said that another message would come along when they got closer, and the colony was silent. 

“Greylock, can we see Halcyon yet?” Alia asked, one morning after her workout. She felt like she did her best thinking while she ran.

“Not with the drive lit, no. The flame is too bright.” Greylock said. “Although…”

“What?”

“We could throttle back and coast for a day or three and use the long range scopes to see, and then throttle back up.” She said, thoughtfully, like she was tasting the idea as she said it. 

“But then we would be going too fast to stop in-system.” Alia said. “Wouldn’t we?”

“So long as we don’t coast for longer than say… two weeks, we can adjust our thrust to compensate. We would have to thrust a few microgees higher to account for the coasting, but you’d barely know it.”

“You’re sure?”

“Alia, I’m *the ship.* I had better be sure. It’s my hull too if I mess it up.”

 “Okay okay!” Alia threw up her hands in surrender. Throttle back, and let’s see what we can see.”

Immediately, the ever present rumble of the drive ceased. Already quiet, the ship became even more silent. It was an oppressive silence, that clanged against your ears, and made it feel like you were wearing plugs. 

Not only that, but since the thrust of the drive was the only source of weight, Alia started to float. She watched as her half empty coffee cup started to drift in the breeze of the HVAC, the surface tension causing the coffee to climb the up to the edge of the mug. Alia grabbed the mug quickly and sucked out the rest of the coffee before it formed spheres and started floating everywhere. Ugh. Alia hated being weightless. Her stomach did flips as she pushed off from her chair and soared towards med. 

Inside the door to med was a case on the wall, and inside *that* was three prefilled hypos of anti-nausea. She pressed one against her thigh, and with a hiss the medicine was forced into her bloodstream. As the nausea subsided it was replaced with the floaty, slightly dizzy feeling from the medicine. It wasn’t pleasant, but it was better than feeling like she was going to throw up everywhere - something that was impressed upon her in training that *was to be avoided*.

Pushing off the wall of med, Alia coasted back up towards command. As she grabbed the handy bar outside of the door, she wrenched her shoulder. Going too fast. She yelped and sucked air in through her teeth.

“You okay, Alia?”

“Yeah, yeah.” She said, rubbing her shoulder. “I had too much momentum. I hate operating in zero gee.” The door to command slid open and she - more slowly this time - floated in, and pulled herself into her chair. She reached under the seat, pressed a button, and safety belts floated out. She buckled in and brought up the main screen. “Okay What can we see?”

“I’ve been recording since you ordered the drive throttled down so we have *something* but we’ll need to train the scopes on the system for a day or so to get a clearer visual. Here’s what I have so far… it’s confusing.”

Greylock sent the image to the screen. It was blurry and really just a few dots, but immediately Alia noticed something wrong. “Gridlock, that’s not the right system. The star is wrong.”

“That’s just it, Alia. That *is* the system. I checked four times. I even triangulated against known magnetars and pulsars. That’s Halcyon. 

But it couldn’t be. Instead of a bight G class star like Sol, it was s much ruddier orange. It was also… smeared. Instead of being a clear dot of light, it was more oval shaped, with what looked like a tail. “What happened to their star, G?”

There was a long pause. Alia stared at the photo, willing it to make sense. “I don’t know, Alia. It’s no longer a G class star, it’s a K or maybe even an M. It’s missing… a lot of hydrogen. The size is wrong too, it’s twice as large as it should be. It’s like the star was drained, but I have no idea how to do that, or even if it’s possible. I didn’t think it was, and with our level of technology it isn’t, but this-” Greylock circled the star “-this says otherwise.”

“Did Halcyon do it do you think?” 

“Did Halcyon destroy their own star? I really don’t think so Alia. *Maybe* if they felt it was a last ditch effort to stop some kind of invader that threatened all of humanity. But no, I think this was done to them.”

They both stared at the photo. 

“Alia, I think we’re going to enter a war and if this is any indication, we’re losing.” 

She said nothing, willing the image to be something, *anything* different. “So what do we do?”

“Well. We have one solution.” Greylock said carefully.

“We do? What’s that, G?”

“We could… not turn our drive back on. We’ve slowed down to .25c but… we would just pass them by. In and out of the system in two days. Nothing that we know of could accelerate to meet us, let alone target us. We’d just… pass by.”

“And go *where*?” Alia gripped the arms of her chair tighter, she hadn’t noticed her fingers turning white. “We’d just what? Go soaring off into interstellar space forever? What about the colonists? What about *us?”*

\*“\*That’s just it, Alia. There is a second choice. There has always been a second choice. The founders knew that there would be a chance that our destination might not work. It would be a… longer trip, but we have the power and supplies to make it. We’d be coasting, it wouldn’t take hardly energy at all.”

“How *much* longer, G?”

“You’d be back in hibernation, you wouldn’t even notice the time, it would-”

“Greylock. How. Much. Longer?”

“Seventeen thousand years.”

Alia had that feeling of everything slipping away from her again. The squirt of adrenaline that couldn’t do anything except give her a panic attack. Her ancient primate brain had evolved to give her an emergency boost of energy to fight a predator, *not* to come to terms with the fact that she’d be in hibernation another seventeen millennia. They’d be in hibernation longer than humans have had *metal.*

\*“\*No.” She said, and shook her head. “No, Gridlock. We’re not doing that. We’re going to continue braking, come to a stop in Halcyon and help the colonists.”

“Alia.” Greylock’s voice was quiet, careful. “What if there aren’t any colonists left? Anyone that can *destroy a star* can cut through us like we’re made of foil. We’d come to a stop and find the remains of a star not bright enough to support life and a planet denuded of everything, *if*  it was even a planet still.” We don’t have enough power to thrust back up to cruising speed after coming to a stop. We get one chance to slow down, do you *really* want to make it here?”

James. The man who send the message warning them that they were already there was named James. Alia wondered if James had a family, what their colony was like… whether he was still alive. He never said how large Halcyon was. What if it was millions of people? She unclipped from her chair and floated out of command. She reached the entry to the cart path, and bent her legs, building up potential energy, and sprang into the colony ship. 

The wind in her ears, she soared through the ship. While they were coasting, the immense size of the ship meant that she didn’t have to worry about hitting anything. She twisted onto her back and looked up. The spine of the ship was another cylinder, and inside that were the fifty thousand colonists. Her responsibility. She was to deliver them safely to a new world. She was supposed to be an extension of humanity. 

So was Halcyon. 

Alia flipped over, and touched onto the other end of the ship, the wall which stored all the colony supplies and provided them with extra protection from the drive, and - more slowly this time - pushed off back towards command. 

“Greylock. Light the drive. We have to stop at Halcyon. If anyone is still alive there, we have to help them, even if all we do is collect the survivors, refuel and start off again towards our second choice system.”

“You’re absolutely sure, Alia? This is a one time choice. There is no going back. There’s another half of a day before I can get a full resolution image of Halcyon. Why don’t you eat, take a nap, and we’ll look at it and then decide.”

Alia shrugged. Another few hours wasn’t going to matter. She didn’t eat - Alia hated eating in zero gee - but she did take a nap. She kept dreaming that she as falling, falling wards a planet that was embroiled in war. Black, oily smoke, the sounds of energy weapons firing, the screams of the victims. She woke up with a start.

Back in command, Alia and Greylock waited for the higher resolution image to load. As it came into focus, Alia could see the similarities. There was the star, ruddy orange, and oblong, but now she could see that a… jet of matter was flowing out from the star - that explained the oblong shape. What was going on? “Greylock, what is happening to the star?”

“It’s almost as if they’re manipulating the plasma of the star into a… jet. They’re weaponizing it! It won’t be very steerable, but it will obliterate anything that it touches.”

Alia almost didn’t want to know, but still she asked, “Is it pointed at Halcyon?”

“I can’t tell at this distance. If it is, we’ll come to a stop in a dead system. If it’s not, then…”

“Then we won’t know who the target was until we get there.” Alia finished. Light the drive. If nothing else, we can learn what happened. If there are survivors, we’ll pick them up.",23,1734282510.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

I haven’t needed my RX meds in over 24h, and I’m basically back to functioning normally but still taking it easy since I’m still healing + I’m quite weak after going so long without eating. 

I wanted to say that day 10 has been great for me so far! Yesterday, my husband made steak and French fries, and I was in so much pain trying to swallow one fry. This morning, I tried again as I’m starving and honestly craving the feeling of food in my mouth and chewing, and I managed to eat two whole plates of the fries with lots of water sips in between bites. I’m trying to explain to my family just how excited I am about this, but I figured you guys would actually get it! 

I still can’t drink normal water—it has to be salty, or it hurts quite badly. I also managed my first cup of coffee since before my surgery on the 5th, and it’s so good! I added collagen powder, clove, pumpkin spice, and a little salt to it + oat milk, and it’s heavenly. 

Anyway, if you’re in the dredges of days 4-8 when things are still getting progressively worse, and you don’t believe you’ll feel even remotely better so soon, it’s coming! Hang in there!!

1hewzu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1hewzu3/bitcoin_should_be_renamed_coin_and_satoshi_should/,Bitcoin should be renamed Coin and Satoshi should be renamed Bitcoin ,"Proposal: Rename ""Bitcoin"" to ""Coin"" and ""Satoshi"" to ""Bitcoin""

Hey Bitcoiners!

I’ve been thinking about the naming structure in the Bitcoin ecosystem and how we could simplify it for mass adoption and everyday use. Here’s my proposal:

Current Naming Issue:

Bitcoin (BTC): The entire unit, currently worth thousands of dollars, feels intimidating for new users.

Satoshi (SAT): The smallest divisible unit, hard for newcomers to grasp without context.


Proposed Change:

1. Rename ""Bitcoin"" to ""Coin"" – This makes the whole unit easier to understand. People are already used to ""coins"" in everyday language.


2. Rename ""Satoshi"" to ""Bitcoin"" – This shifts the focus to the smaller unit, making transactions and micro-payments easier to comprehend.



Why It Makes Sense:

People could say, ""I own 1 Coin"" (formerly 1 BTC).

They could also say, ""I sent you 10,000 Bitcoins"" (formerly Satoshis).

It aligns better with how currencies are named (like dollars and cents).


Examples in Use:

Coffee shop: ""That’ll be 50,000 Bitcoins"" (about $15 today).

Investment talk: ""I just bought 0.5 Coin!""


What do you think? Would this make adoption easier, or do you prefer keeping things as they are? Let’s discuss! 🚀

I’ve been talking to a woman I met on a dating app for about a month now, and we’re both exploring our queer identities for the first time later in life (30s). She’s just getting out of a marriage, and I’m happily married to a man but we’ve been open/dating others for a few months now after 15+ years of faithfulness/monogamy. 

This woman and I have both taken off Jan 10 for a first date, and we’re really excited. This will be the first date with a woman for both of us. 

Anyway, she and I both have talked about how much we wish our partners would have planned more real dates for us, how planning makes us feel loved, and how desperate we are for a bit of romance. She’s in Kokomo and I’m in Muncie, so the Indy/Carmel area seems like a good spot to meet up. I told her I’d like to plan and pay for the first date and if there’s good chemistry I’d love for her to plan/pay for the second, so we both get that experience. Please help me plan a date that will give her ALL the butterflies. 

Below is my current plan, but I’d LOVE insights or ideas or swaps. 


- Meet late morning for coffee at Java House in Carmel
- Walk to Penn & Beech for a candle-pouring workshop (I’ll have to make a reservation)
- Walk to a late lunch at Social Cantina 
- If the vibes are good and we both want to keep hanging out, drive her to a movie at Flix Brewhouse Carmel and maybe smooch a little
- Depending on how much energy we have left and if the date is still going well, maybe take her for boba tea and donuts at Bober Tea And Mochi Dough after. It’s super cute and romantic and girly.

Also - let me know if this is wayyy too much. 

I want to show her a great time and make her feel really special, but I’m also pretty sure I make a lot more money than her and don’t want to do anything so extra that she feels pressured to return the favor in the same way for date 2. I don’t *think* this is overly bougie or extravagant, but it IS a lot of activities for one day. ",0,1734282280.0,Carmel,1,0.43,False

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, as opposed to a one off conversation, but that would depend on how well we click! 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health

TLDR I think my friends energy is messing with my life

So since I was 9, I had a friend in my life named L. She was a good friend. A lot of things happened and our friendship deteriorated by the time I was 15. 
Around that time I fell in love with my boyfriend and everything was honestly great. Then when I was 21 I started having dreams about L, out of guilt I reconnected with her.
After I brought her back into my life, I started having problems I never did in my life before. Every time we communicated or went for coffee, I'd start having problems I never had with my boyfriend as well. He never had a problem with me hanging out with her, but he straight up told me that after she came back into my life there was something up with me. And I never noticed something off.

I feel like I do have certain energetic abilities, mostly it's in shape of random statements that pop up on my head, which turn out to be true. Or if I'd ask a question and have an answer in my head instantly, only sometimes though. Sometimes I'd get those answers through dreams. And so after Ls appearance in my life, I've been seeing strange entities more frequently in my nightmares, sleep paralysis became more frequent. During one of those, it felt like I saw her dark figure standing in my doorway. Alongside many dreams and nightmares of her betraying me or treating me as an enemy.

Now, most weirdly, before asking God something along the lines of what is causing all this negativity in my life, I had one of the worst nightmares with her. I have written a post about it before, so it is on my profile somewhere. 

Nowadays, the moment I even text her out of curtsy, I start having misfortunes in all kinds of shapes. Arguments with my boyfriend, not feeling well mentally and whatnot...",5,1734281711.0,energy_work,3,1.0,False

Hey, I’ve been thinking about it over the weekend and I don’t think we need to get coffee anymore to be honest. I wasn’t aware before that you were telling Brooke things about me before so I think it’s best we just leave things as it is. I guess I’m just a little caught off guard because I genuinely didn’t think either of us had an issue since the last time we saw each other in person- then I found out about everything that’s been going on since then. The last thing that happened between us you apologized for and we moved on, so I didn’t think we had a problem. Also, I’m not sure what you told her but the only thing I said about her to other people was that about my experience and how I felt at the time. We went for coffee and talked a few months ago and it hasn’t been a problem since before the summer  so I can’t help but feel hurt about you bringing it back up, especially when you were contributing to those conversations too. Since I wasn’t happy with the way I was being treated, I have done everything I can to separate myself and move on, I’m not talking about you or anyone, I don’t have a problem with you now and I do wish you all the best but I think we should keep things as they are now 

Struggling with fallout from friendship 

Hey Reddit, I’m in a tough situation and could really use some advice. I’m a transfer student, and last year I became friends with someone who had just graduated and was almost two years older than me. She was very sociable and confident—someone people were naturally drawn to. I really admired her in a lot of ways, but at times, her confidence was a bit intimidating, and there were moments when she came across as judgmental, which left me unsure of where I stood with her. I never quite knew if she liked me or if I was just someone she tolerated, and that uncertainty made me anxious.

I struggle with severe morality OCD, so I tend to overthink things a lot, especially when it comes to relationships. I constantly question if I’m being too sensitive or misinterpreting situations. So, last year, I talked to a few other people about how I was feeling, just to get some perspective and see if I was overreacting or if my concerns were valid. I didn’t think I was gossiping or “talking behind her back”—I just needed to process my feelings. But recently, she found out that I had spoken to others, and she ended up blocking me.

Her main point in all this seems to be that if I felt this way about her, I shouldn’t have hung out with her so much in the first place. I can understand that, but at the time, I really thought if I tried harder, she’d be kinder to me or less judgmental of my choices. I kept hoping that with time, she’d warm up to me more, or at least treat me with a little more understanding. Instead, I was left feeling confused and unsure of where I stood, and I think I made the mistake of not addressing these concerns sooner.

What’s been especially hard for me is that she’s older and more confident, and I struggle to understand how someone like her could be in the wrong, or how I could have messed up this badly. I’ve always looked up to her in some ways, and now it feels like I’m the one who’s made all the mistakes. I just don’t know how to make sense of it all.

To give you some context, I come from a family where communication was very difficult and emotionally abusive, so learning how to navigate relationships has been a big challenge for me. Living on my own for the first time last year was a huge learning experience, and while I’ve made some mistakes, I’ve also grown a lot. 

I’m just really struggling with the anxiety around this situation and feeling like she might think the worst of me, or that it could affect my life in ways I don’t fully understand. It’s only this part that’s making me contemplate not wanting to live anymore. I’m so worried mistakes I made will haunt me forever since they came back this time and I just want to end it all.",1,1734281683.0,SuicideWatch,0,1.0,False

I was posting 1 joke a day everyday by myself, a busy week here was 4 or 5 people posting a week and maybe a dozen comments. This year we had 7,744 posts and comments from 397 THOUSAND people that visited this community!

I was very blessed to have several people become regularish posters with in 3 months or so and that is how I was able to get in touch with the invaluable u/Futch1 and u/moar-coffee-plz and bring them on board as mods.  None of us had much experience but we had and have a love for r/cleandadjokes.  

We were blessed last year with u/ThePlotWatcher join us and integrate all the indexes and make this subreddit look as awesome and coordinated as it does!  Thanks to Plot we will be incorporating the Cleandadjokes HALL OF FAME! I wonder if u/fizzmore will be in it 🤔 

We have been blessed with so many regulars that posted and commented along the way and now are at a point to incorporate that growth with user flair. If you're interested in flair be it for browsing and upvoting,  commenting or posting leave a comment below!

This summer I was forced to step away from reddit for a few months and just recently came back after my account was hacked.  I was absolutely blown away by the growth during that time,  over 12 thousand people joined in 4/5 months. THANK YOU!

We were ""blessed"" by reddit telling us we needed new mods and are so thankful that we were, as it allowed us to bring in new mods that have a passion for r/cleandadjokes that supercedes mod experience.  
We were fortunate to have u/spacemouse21 u/anonymousPuncake1 , u/bigsucka and u/different-tie-1085 thank you so much for joining us!


This has been a crazy year and we apologize for not beomg able to sticky and keep up with the JOTM winners but I have gone back and updated the would be winners with user flair and even had a couple become repeat winners (check the ammount of crowns) and  due to that we will be handling this years JOTY differently and going with the MOST UPVOTED (naturally was never stickied) joke not just this year but ALL TIME! By u/og-kushi who follows 2023 years JOTY winner (no surprise honestly) u/fizzmore ! In 2025 both will be inducted in to the r/cleandadjokes HALL OF FAME! It will also be stickied all of 2025!

December's. highest upvoted joke will be the 1st JOTM in 2025, so still time to post and win which will make you eligible for JOTY which will GUARANTEE your spot in the HALL OF FAME for the eternity of reddit.

When the hall of fame is introduced we will be posting the requirements to join (yes others are part  of the inaugural class)

Once again, thank you all for an incredible 2024 and we look forward to continued growth, perhaps even share the name of our sub in RL, u/Futch1 himself just had a conversation with someone in RL who told him they read a joke from r/cleandadjokes every day to start their meeting.

Not only this but shit caused me severe athelete's foot too. I applied some cream daily and still I had not seen any improvement. But then I started to take the problem seriously.

Actually there are many possibilities of what you could have. It could jock itch, intertrigo (very similar to jock itch and I believe I suffered from this), candidiasis, etc.

I didn't visit any dermatologist, cuz honestly I was shy. But if you're not shy, then it's better to go visit them.

After a hell lot of research from reddit and online sources, these are the thing I started doing that cured my severe itch :


- Stop eating sugars STRICTLY. They feed the fungus and helps them grow. Ngl by doing this single handedly cure my jock itch by 80%. So yes this is one of the major reasons for my cure

- Eat healthy, no junks and try to not skip any meal, especially breakfast. Also try consuming fish oil capsules or any kind of immunity development thing.

- After showers, completely dry out the affected area, there should no water. Trim out the hair in the affected area if any as they trap moisture. For a faster drying out process, use tissue papers to absorb the moisture.

- Once done, use a dusting powder and apply it to the area if you are going out or to work.

For athelete's foot,

- Take a spray bottle (you can get it from plastic stores nearby). Fill it's 1/2 with vinegar and other half with Listerine.

- spray on the affected area daily and let it dry. Then apply dusting powder. Wash off when you go to shower later or better to let it dry and wash it off in the morning.

For jock itch,

- I used a combination of zalim lotion, itch guard and ketacozanole.

Btw keep a seperate towel to dry the affected area and wash it often with hot water.

Continue doing this for atleast a month and thank me later.

The main thing is completely cut off sugars. Don't even drink coffee or any shit that might contain sugar.

Also try using povidone iodine before applying the recommended lotions and creams before sleep and wash it off in the morning.",1,1734281305.0,DermatologyQuestions,1,1.0,False

* Sony A7iii with sigma art lens 35mm and sigma 85mm for semi professional work. 



* Leica q3 for international travel and my favorite to bring 



* Fujifilm x100v for street and domestic travel



* Small Flash 



Tech/other stuff I bring in the bag 



* MacBook Pro 16 inch with incase case

She’s just getting out of a marriage, and I’m happily married to a man but we’ve been open/dating others for a few months now after 15+ years of faithfulness/monogamy. 

This woman and I have both taken off Jan 10 for a first date, and we’re really excited. This will be the first date with a woman for both of us. 

Anyway, she and I both have talked about how much we wish our partners would have planned more real dates for us, how planning makes us feel loved, and how desperate we are for a bit of romance. She’s in Kokomo and I’m in Muncie, so the Indy/Carmel area seems like a good spot to meet up. I told her I’d like to plan and pay for the first date and if there’s good chemistry I’d love for her to plan/pay for the second, so we both get that experience. Please help me plan a date that will give her ALL the butterflies. 

Below is my current plan, but I’d LOVE insights or ideas or swaps. 


- Meet late morning for coffee at Java House in Carmel
- Walk to Penn & Beech for a candle-pouring workshop (I’ll have to make a reservation)
- Drive her to a late lunch at Social Cantina 
- If the vibes are good and we both want to keep hanging out, take her to a movie at Flix Brewhouse Carmel and maybe smooch a little
- Depending on how much energy we have left and if the date is still going well, maybe take her for boba tea and donuts at Bober Tea And Mochi Dough after. It’s super cute and romantic and girly.

Also - let me know if this is wayyy too much. I want to show her a great time and make her feel really special, but I’m also pretty sure I make a lot more money than her and don’t want to do anything so extra that she feels pressured to return the favor in the same way for date 2. I don’t *think* this is overly bougie or extravagant, but it IS a lot of activities for one day. ",0,1734281005.0,indianapolis,3,0.33,False
1hewi3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1hewi3f/how_my_particular_choices_turned_out_7_years_later/,"How My Particular Choices Turned Out, 7+ Years Later","I'm not advocating for anyone else to make the same decisions I have made after my wife died in early 2017. Everyone has their own path forward, as best they can manage.

I was 58 when she died, and we had been together for 27 years. I had my my own business and worked from home. She did not have a job outside of the home, so the financial situation was not dependent on a second income. All of our children were adults and no longer living with us. 

My decision was to not have any more romantic relationships whatsoever. Whenever a woman approached me or appeared to be flirting, I shut it down immediately. I made sure to continue wearing my wedding ring. 

To put it bluntly, I pretended she still lived and was still with me as an invisible spirit, so to speak. If I craved sexual intimacy, I fantasized about her and practiced DIY.  I talked to her out loud and in my head. I poured her a cup of coffee every morning, sat on our porch, pretended to light her cigarette and just talked about normal stuff the way we always did.  I asked her what she wanted to eat, and whatever it seemed to me she chose, I'd make it and we'd watch our favorite shows ""together,"" as I imagined her sitting next to me just like always.

None of this interfered at all with my capacity to function in life and interact with others - in fact, it helped a lot. The pain and grief subsided - rather quickly, as I found out from others going through this, compared to most people. I started feeling happy again. Honestly, over time, it felt like she was with me, that our relationship was continuing, and we were creating new memories together.

I know that all probably sounds like I'm living a very sad life, and that is probably how most people would think of it. For me, however, it's actually become quite wonderful. I enjoy life immensely. It could be a complete self-delusion, but who cares, as long as I'm happy, functional, and not hurting anyone? I'm content, enthusiastic, have fun and feel whole again, and have for a long time now. If I die tomorrow and just wink out of existence, I am fully satisfied and happy with how I have lived my life and the choices that I made. 

However, if I die and she is there to greet me, then I get to tell her ""I was true to you, baby."" And maybe she will tell me, ""I know, I was there. That was me with you all that time.""

Either way, it is a great love story, perhaps tragic at the end, perhaps with a wonderful, magical ending, but still a love story I absolutely, completely love and am happy, joyful and enthusiastic to be living.

Background of relevant info: Taking D-mannose for uti prevention, and was on cipro 500mg for 5 days 2 weeks ago. I also have some mild issues with blood sugar (possibly diabetic, I’m sorting it out with my family doctor). Currently going through a very stress-inducing time of my life so I’m hoping this is a normal side effect of being extremely burnt out and not a serious issue. I used to use weed daily for about a year, but quit 6 months ago after I started experiencing extreme panic attacks that I’d never had before. My anxiety has been hard to manage ever since. 

Long story short: got up this morning, had toast and coffee this morning and two glasses of water with my dmannose as usual. Nothing out of the ordinary. I’m in grad school currently and in exam season and I’ve been stressed to the nines. I started driving with my boyfriend, and about twenty minutes into the car ride the left side of my lips went numb and tingly. Like, pins and needles. I’ve never ever had this before, so it freaked me out. I started moving my mouth and I had full range of motion, but it just FELT SO weird. It passed after 30 seconds and then started happening in my left hand. Again, I could fully move it but it felt really weird. I’ve never ever felt anything like it. I checked the mirror and my lips weren’t changing colour, and I checked my pupils and they were responding to light and I could still talk normally and move my face normally. I’m not much of a hypochondriac, but anything that could be neurologically related has me concerned.
Is this a normal symptom of being really anxious? I didn’t sleep well last night and I’m hoping this weirdness is just a normal side effect of being way too anxious and sleep deprived.

I just got a brand new M3 Macbook Air and have been *so* careful with it, and then something dumb like this happens. I had it sitting with the lid closed on my coffee table, and was eating rice out of a pretty heavy porcelain kitchen bowl last night, and when I went to set the bowl down on my coffee table, somehow I lost my grip and it fell from a couple inches above the Macbook and landed with a heavy thud right on the corner of the closed lid. :(

I think it was on the left side or maybe the back side -- the lights were off so I didn't see exactly where it hit, but it sounded pretty bad. I was afraid it would be dented or chipped.

I looked it over and don't see any scratches or dents and the screen seems to be working fine, but with this horrible OCD condition, I tend to obsess over the what-ifs -- like what if there's damage I'm not seeing or what if there's residual internal damage that will show up later and cause performance issues.

What do you guys think? Is there any chance this could have actually done any level of damage, or, if I don't see any scratches or dents, should I be thankful and just move on and forget about it?

Also -- does anyone have good screen protector/case suggestions?

When I open the store I get to pick the music so I often put on The Midnight. After a few hours of shuffling through random songs this one comes on, but I'm usually too busy to check the tablet to see it.

Its got a strong soul vibe and its really melancholy. The chorus has line like ""Barely human anymore. Just a machine"" or something similar. It might be ""no longer human anyway. a metal machine"" For the life of me I cant find this song.

I have personally visited all these.","This is not AI article, I first wrote everything then edited format and grammar from gpt, so it is AI fixed but not AI article. This is not marketing; I get no discounts aside from dineout discount and I don't know who has best burger or sandwich cuz I haven't tried all the items in menu of these places.

**Now I think I’ve visited nearly every good café in Jaipur and have completed 90% of my list.**  
This list doesn’t include vegetarian restaurants as I’m not a fan of vegetarian food of restaurants.

*All opinions on taste are personal; you may or may not agree with them.*

# For Coffees

# Expensive Options: (These have great side dishes too. Town coffee and half-life have worst sandwiches and wraps compared to others)

* **Curious Coffee**: Offers the most variety of coffees but is noisy most of the time these days.
* **Roastery Coffee House**: The seating for two inside is really cozy, and the coffee tastes great.
* **Town Coffee / Half Life Coffee Roasters**: Good coffee, but the noise level is extreme.
* **Cafe Earest**: A small coffee house, occasionally silent. Great coffee, perfect for coffee dates.
* **Noir**: A silent place with simple coffee house vibes. Nothing extraordinary, but the coffee tastes as good as any of the above places.
* **Brot Co.**: A small, cozy place. Coffee isn’t its highlight but still great.

# Mid-Range Options:

* **Cafe Toscana**: My personal favorite—cozy, silent, with nice coffee and consistently great food.
* **Rangoon Brewer**: Just a step below Toscana.
* **Brewvvana**: Usually silent, but the taste is mediocre.
* **Coffee Cartel**: Just meh.
* **Coffee Bond**: Normally expensive, but discounts make it worthwhile. The taste is alright, though quality has declined under new management.

# Low-Range (Coffee Shakes):

* **Crazy Coffee, LOC, NBC, La Dolce Vita, New York Coffee**: Good for shakes. *(Note: LOC Vaishali and CC Jagatpura don’t seem to be low range anymore.)*

# For Snacks

# Expensive Options:

* **Akuri**: Perfect for dates. Serves Indian snacks. Taste is subjective, but I personally loved their Arancini but heard from others that they didn't liked it.
* **Tapri**: Overpriced (I can never understand ₹200 for Maggi!) and noisy.
* **Noir**: The snacks taste good, nothing more to add.
* **Lazy Mozo**: Noisy and mediocre, though I’ve heard that dishes taste have improved.
* **Hops n Taters**: Top-notch service.

# Mid-Range Options:

* **Sequoia**: Unique variety and dishes taste great and great ambiance too.
* **Chaats n Chutneys**: Comparable to Bikanerwala in price, but the taste and aesthetics are amazing.
* **Assamica**: Used to be amazing but has downgraded recently.
* **Toscana**: The snacks here are great too.
* **Lamp Post**: Overall meh.

# Low-Range:

* *(No notable mentions.)*

# For Non-Vegetarian Food

* **Handi / Miroh (C-Scheme)**: Miroh has better vibes with the same amazing taste. Slightly expensive, but a 10% Dineout discount helps. (Avoid the Vaishali branch—horrible naan and a total rip-off!)
* **Auberge**: Great ambiance, calm atmosphere, and good-quality chicken.
* **Zarpar**: Mutton is great, but strictly avoid their vegetarian dishes.
* **Abdul Baki Takeaway**: The oldest kebab shop. Their *murgh hara dhaniya* is good. Perfect for those seeking good portions of chicken at a reasonable price.
* **Tawook**: Avoid. Though the taste is good, their practices are horrible—₹50 for salad (without asking), 2x charge on mrp for cans, and couldn't even find mutton in mutton biryani, just bones. Don't go on owner age, old man is a scammer

# For Hangouts with Friends

* **The Farm Coffee Bar**: Perfect outdoor seating for long talks over coffee.
* **Madam D’Souza**: A more affordable version of The Farm Coffee Bar. Smaller but charming. *(Both attract smokers due to their outdoor setup.)*
* **For “Kothi Bangle Wale Log”**: Town Coffee, Half Life Coffee Roasters, and Tapri.

# For Authentic Pizza (All expensive)

* **Bonkey’s**: Tasty but has an extra service charge. Ask for normal water, or they’ll give you a ₹50 bottle.
* **Napoli**: No service charge and serves normal water without asking.
* **Mad Over Crust**

# For Sweet Tooth

# Expensive Options:

* **Brot Co.**: Extremely Pricey but worth it. The tiramisu and apple cinnamon waffle are best desserts I have ever tried in my whole life!
* **Dzurt**: Great ambiance, especially if you get a glass window seat. Perfect for dates. The cream is thick and flavorful.
* **Camiano**: Expensive, and I don’t think the price justifies the quality or ambiance. The cream is softer than Dzurt and feels more silky but less flavorful.
* **Obaque**: A total rip-off. Dry bread pastries, burnt biscuits, though the cheesecake is decent (sometimes dry).
* **Jars & More**: Another rip-off.

# Mid-Range Options:

* **La Bannouche**: Soft cream but not enough flavors and good quantity for the price.
* **Dolce**: Cream donuts are amazing and great for long conversations since it always remain silent.
* **La Dolce Vita**: Their cheesecake and tiramisu are great.
* **Fatt Guy**: Overall good pastries.

# For Aesthetic Photos

* **Sequoia**: Less crowded with a cozy interior vibe.
* **Obaque**: Great outdoor seating in the evening with a peaceful environment.
* **Magnolia**: Stunning evening views.
* **Attariya**: Perfect for aesthetic shots.
* **Cafe Quaint (Behind JKK)**: Ideal for photos.
* **Dzurt :** Peaceful place and well maintained outside garden

**For Chinese**

* **House of Han**: Great discounts and good quantity (non veg though mostly)
* **La multigrain**: For veg chinese option, munchurian and fried rice combination is amazing
* **Shofu/Clay cafe:** Really good wheat momos.

Some options which doesn't fit in any criteria -

Rustic cafe - Decent for price

Mamma taco - Really didn't liked their most expensive taco.

# Must Avoid

* **Anokhi**: Overpriced, cold food disguised as “fresh items.”
* **Once Upon a Time at Bagh**: Minimum order value of 3000 and drink menu is printed from hp printer on paper, and waiters treat you based on how rich you appear.

It seems as though the average savings of an old person in Singapore actually isn't that much at all. Like I've seen news articles claiming a 60+ year old man losing his life savings of $500k or something. If that's only how much these people who are expected to retire soon have as their 'life savings', it sure seems contradictory to what people on this sub love to claim as sufficient to retire on.

So if these oldies seem fine with such low 'life savings', do we really need like $3 million or something to retire? Or is it merely a fantasy retirement lifestyle people on this sub are thinking of that require such life savings? Assuming you just live a very mundane existence as a retiree and just buy cai png or something from coffee shops everyday to eat, you can prob easily get by with max $1000 per month.  Take 1000\*12\*40 (assuming you retire at 60 and survive till 100), you merely need just about $500k to indeed survive on. Sure, there's inflation to take note of but you can also reduce on the kind of food you eat as well as invest that retirement sum into treasuries, bonds and stock to still offset with your gains.",0,1734280110.0,singaporefi,29,0.29,False

1hew6ft,https://www.reddit.com/r/Truthoffmychest/comments/1hew6ft/i_think_i_am_falling_in_love_with_my_bosss_dad/,I think I am falling in love with my boss's dad.,"5 months ago I(30F) lost a friend to her 6 year fight with ovarian cancer, her husband (74) and I are also friends and have been for the past 12 years. When she told me about her cancer I burst into tears and she had to comfort me(something I regret that she had to do), she was so optimistic and belived she would be fine. Her husband had come to me in spring last year to tell me about his colon cancer-they had caught it really early thankfully and he is fine- however I had another breakdown. I love them very much, I still very much do.

We were both hit very hard to her loss, and spent alot of time crying. I made sure he is getting grief counseling as their family seemed to move along alot faster than we have been. Due to us grieving and me being around him alot due to my job (his son is my boss and has been for the past 14-15 years), him and I have gotten closer, very close. He knows more about my past then even my boss, and I know alot about him. 

 We recently had gotten together for coffee and he told me that he loves me, I make him feel cared about because I very obviously do care. I was shocked and confused, I told him that I love him, as I loved his wife and family, but I didnt think I could love him the way he wants. He said he doesnt care and just wants to be around me more. 
Then the next coffee he asked me to kiss him. Now I am normally opposed to human contact, I can shake hands and hug people I care about, but thats it.  I have never been kissed or anything else. He explained he just wanted to try but he wont force me to do anything I am uncomfortable with. I decided to give it a try... and I like kissing him.
We made out in his truck for the next trip and he told me he wants me, touched me, and I let him. 
I really feel comfortable around him, I find his touch exhilarating, him running his fingers by my neck and shoulders drives me crazy(even thinking of it)
The next 'coffee' we went to his place and after getting over the initial shock (of her absence in the house), he took me to his room. 
He very slowly undressed me, was shocked that I indeed have breasts(I wear enough layers it hides them), and he finds them breathtaking. He kissed them as he continued to undress me, and I attempted to undress him. I am awkward, His pants came down and I pointed stating 'thats a penis' and we laughed. He had to take a viagra, I explained thats the first time I've seen a mans penis in person, and I am still a virgin. He told me he hadnt had sex for over 6 years and wasnt sure how good he will be or even if he could. It took a bit but I am patient, He took me carefully at first, and got a little more rough after a bit- thats fine as I was indeed enjoying myself. We had sex 4 times and he came twice, I have no clue how many times I did but it was alot. We were both very sore the next day from using muscles that arent used to being used that way. But we still had coffee that evening we talked, made out, and he fingered me... more like finger fcked me and I came more than I ever have before, he kept it going, it was at least 40mins to a whole hour... we didnt know I could do that but he found it intoxicating... I could barely speak and was absolutely exhausted. Now we have plans for Monday... 

I am scared, as I do really love him. Talking to him has always seemed so easy, I feel safe around him. He says he feels he's got another good 15 years in him, which I dont feel is enough for me, I wish I was older or he younger. If any of his sons find out they will have a fit, My boss is protective over me as I am his best employee and heavily specialized in my job. I dont want to loose it, but I also dont want him to be angry at his dad. Nor do I want to stop seeing his dad.

Apologies for the way this is typed out, I am shit at this.

*TLDR- My boss lost his mother due to cancer 5 months ago, his 74yo dad and I(30f) have gotten very close to the point of love, he took my virginity, and have plans to do it again.

1hew5vo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1hew5vo/free_vpn_for_ios_enjoy_safe_browsing_without_any/,Free VPN for iOS: Enjoy Safe Browsing Without Any Cost,"**Introduction: The Need for VPNs in 2024**

In today’s digital world, the need for online security and privacy has never been more crucial. Whether you're using the internet for casual browsing or more sensitive activities, protecting your data and personal information is paramount. With constant threats such as hackers, identity theft, and privacy invasions, a VPN (Virtual Private Network) has become an essential tool for users across the globe.

A VPN works by creating a secure, encrypted connection between your device and the internet, allowing you to browse without the fear of being tracked. For iOS users, such as those using iPhones or iPads, a VPN is particularly important. iOS devices are widely popular for their reliability, but even Apple users are not immune to online threats. This is where a **free VPN for iOS** comes into play, offering a way to protect your privacy without spending a dime. In this post, we’ll explore the benefits of using a free VPN, how it works, and why it’s an excellent option for iOS users seeking enhanced security.

**What Does a VPN Do? A Brief Overview**

To fully appreciate the value of a free VPN, it’s essential to understand what a VPN does. A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet. This means that all data exchanged between your device and websites or services is securely transmitted, preventing third parties from intercepting it. It effectively hides your IP address, making you anonymous online.

There are several benefits of using a VPN. The primary advantage is enhanced privacy and security. By masking your real IP address, VPNs make it harder for websites, advertisers, and hackers to track your online activities. VPNs also allow users to access geo-blocked content, bypass internet censorship, and browse freely without fear of data breaches.

Different types of VPNs are available, including free and paid options. Free VPNs, in particular, are growing in popularity as they offer an easy way to enjoy basic VPN benefits without any financial commitment. However, free VPNs often come with some limitations, such as restricted server options or slower connection speeds. Despite these drawbacks, free VPNs are still a great way to protect your privacy, especially for light users.

**Understanding Free VPNs: Are They Worth It?**

Free VPNs are often seen as a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they offer a no-cost way to improve your privacy and security online. On the other hand, they can come with some downsides that might make you think twice before using them.

# Pros of Free VPNs:

1. **No Cost:** The biggest advantage is that they are free. This makes them a great option for users who want basic privacy protection without committing to a paid subscription.
2. **Ease of Use:** Most free VPNs are incredibly easy to install and set up. This is perfect for iOS users who want a straightforward solution without having to dive into complex settings.
3. **Basic Security Features:** Even free VPNs offer essential security features, such as encryption, which helps protect your data while browsing or using public Wi-Fi.

# Cons of Free VPNs:

1. **Limited Features:** Many free VPNs come with limitations, such as fewer server locations or data usage restrictions. This means that your browsing experience might not be as fast or smooth as with a premium VPN.
2. **Slower Speeds:** Because free VPNs often have fewer resources, you might experience slower speeds, especially during peak times when many users are connected.
3. **Risk of Data Logging:** Some free VPN services have been known to log user data, potentially compromising your privacy. This makes it crucial to check the privacy policy of any free VPN before using it.

Ultimately, free VPNs are a great way to dip your toes into the world of VPNs, but if you need more robust security features, a paid option might be worth considering. However, for casual users who simply want to stay safe online, free VPNs can be quite effective.

**Why Choose a Free VPN for iOS?**

With more people relying on their iPhones and iPads for everyday tasks, iOS has become one of the most popular platforms for mobile internet use. Free VPN for iOS can significantly enhance the security and privacy of these devices.

For one, iOS is generally known for its strong security features. However, when you use public Wi-Fi networks, you’re still vulnerable to hackers and other malicious actors. A free VPN adds a layer of protection, ensuring that your browsing activity remains private, even when you're connected to an unsecured Wi-Fi network.

Additionally, free VPNs are often very user-friendly. Setting up a VPN on an iPhone or iPad is usually a breeze. Many free VPN apps offer simple, intuitive interfaces, making it easy for even tech novices to protect their online activities. This accessibility is one of the reasons why many iOS users turn to free VPNs—especially those who don't want to dive into technical details or pay for an ongoing subscription.

Moreover, many people use VPNs to access geo-restricted content. Streaming platforms and websites often limit content based on your location, but with a free VPN for iOS, you can easily bypass these restrictions and enjoy content from around the world. This makes it an appealing option for travelers, expatriates, or anyone who wants to access websites or services that aren’t available in their region.

**The Pros of Using Free VPN for iOS Devices**

Using a free VPN on your iOS device can have several advantages. First and foremost, it offers a higher level of privacy protection compared to browsing without one. Here are some of the main benefits of using a free VPN for iOS:

# 1. Privacy Protection on Public Wi-Fi:

Public Wi-Fi networks are notoriously insecure. Cybercriminals often target these networks to steal personal information or spread malware. By using a VPN on your iPhone or iPad, you encrypt your internet traffic, making it difficult for anyone on the same network to intercept your data.

# 2. Bypassing Geo-restrictions:

A free VPN can help you access websites or services that may be blocked or restricted in your location. Whether it’s streaming services like Netflix or news websites, you can virtually “move” to another country and access the content you want, even if it’s unavailable in your region.

# 3. Reducing Online Tracking:

Many websites and advertisers use tracking cookies to monitor your online activities. A free VPN can help hide your IP address, reducing the ability of third parties to track your browsing habits. This is especially useful for users who value their privacy and want to minimize the amount of data collected about them.

# 4. Low or No Cost to Users:

The most obvious advantage of using a free VPN is that it costs nothing. While premium VPNs may require monthly or yearly subscriptions, free VPNs are available at no charge. This is ideal for people who need basic VPN protection but don’t want to pay for a service.

**What to Look for in a Free VPN for iOS**

While free VPNs are a great option for many iOS users, not all free services are created equal. To ensure that you’re getting a secure and reliable VPN experience, there are several features you should look for:

1. **Strong Encryption:** The core function of a VPN is to encrypt your data. Make sure the free VPN you choose uses strong encryption protocols, such as AES-256, to ensure your data is protected. Without proper encryption, your data could be vulnerable to hackers and other malicious actors.
2. **No-Logs Policy:** Some free VPNs track and store information about your online activities, which can defeat the purpose of using a VPN. Always check the privacy policy to ensure that the VPN service has a no-logs policy, meaning they do not store any data about your internet usage.
3. **Reliable Connection and Speed:** Look for a free VPN that provides a stable connection with minimal downtime. Slow speeds can make browsing frustrating, especially when streaming or using data-heavy applications. Although free VPNs may not offer the same speeds as paid versions, ensure that the service you choose offers reasonable speeds for regular use.
4. **Avoid VPN Scams:** Free VPNs are sometimes used as a vehicle for malware or phishing scams. Always download a VPN from a reputable source, such as the App Store, to reduce the risk of downloading malicious software. Avoid services that ask for excessive personal information or promise “too good to be true” benefits.

**Is It Safe to Use Free VPNs for iOS?**

When considering whether to use a **free VPN for iOS**, one of the most common questions is: Are they safe? While free VPNs can offer valuable privacy and security benefits, they may also come with some risks that users need to be aware of.

# Security Concerns with Free VPNs

The main concern with free VPNs lies in their security. Some free services may not encrypt your data properly or might even have weak encryption protocols. This can leave your online activity exposed to hackers, which defeats the whole point of using a VPN in the first place. Additionally, free VPNs may not have the resources to maintain strong security measures or detect vulnerabilities in their system.

# How to Evaluate a VPN’s Privacy Policy

One of the best ways to determine whether a free VPN is safe to use is by evaluating its privacy policy. Reputable VPN services will have clear and transparent privacy policies that outline how they handle user data. Ideally, the VPN should have a **no-logs policy**, meaning they don’t track or store any data related to your internet activity. This is crucial for maintaining your privacy while using the VPN.

In contrast, some free VPNs may store your data and use it for advertising purposes or even sell it to third-party companies. Always check if the VPN clearly states that it does not log any data and that it will not share your personal information with third parties.

# Key Risks to Avoid with Free VPNs

There are several potential risks to using free VPNs that should be considered:

1. **Data Leaks:** Some free VPNs may not adequately protect against data leaks, such as DNS or IP leaks, which can expose your real location and browsing activity. Always test the VPN to ensure it does not leak any of your data.
2. **Malware and Adware:** Some free VPNs may inject malware, ads, or unwanted programs into your device. This is especially true for VPNs that don’t come from trusted sources like the App Store.
3. **Overcrowded Servers:** Free VPNs often have limited server options, which means that many users are connected to the same server. This can cause slower speeds and make it harder to maintain a secure connection, as congestion might compromise the service’s integrity.

# How to Stay Safe

To minimize the risks associated with free VPNs, always choose a service that is well-reviewed and has a reputable track record. It’s also a good idea to test the VPN before using it regularly, checking for any leaks or unexpected behavior. If you’re uncertain about the service’s security, it might be better to stick with paid options that offer stronger guarantees.

**How Free VPNs Protect Your Privacy**

A key reason people turn to VPNs is for the privacy they provide. When you use a **free VPN for iOS**, your data is encrypted, and your real IP address is hidden. Here’s how these VPNs help protect your privacy:

# How Encryption Secures Your Online Data

Encryption is the cornerstone of any good VPN. When you connect to the internet via a VPN, your data is encrypted before it leaves your device. This means that even if someone intercepts your traffic (like a hacker on public Wi-Fi), they won’t be able to read the data. The encryption process essentially turns your online activity into an unreadable string of characters that only the VPN server can decrypt.

Free VPNs typically use industry-standard encryption methods, such as **AES-256**, which is considered highly secure. This level of encryption is commonly used by banks and other financial institutions to protect sensitive data, making it a reliable choice for securing your internet traffic.

# What is a No-Logs Policy and Why It Matters

A **no-logs policy** means that the VPN service does not store any information about your online activities. Without logs, even if authorities or hackers try to request data, there is no information for them to obtain. This is one of the key features to look for when choosing a VPN, as it ensures that your privacy is maintained even after your online session ends.

Some free VPNs may not have a strict no-logs policy. They may store connection data, IP addresses, or browsing history, which can be used to identify you or track your activity. Be sure to read the privacy policy of any free VPN to confirm that it doesn’t log your information.

# The Role of DNS and IP Masking

Free VPNs mask your IP address, making it appear as though you're browsing from a different location. This adds another layer of privacy because websites and online services won’t be able to track your real location. For example, if you're in one country but want to access content available only in another, a VPN will make it look as though you're browsing from the second country.

Additionally, **DNS (Domain Name System)** requests are routed through the VPN, preventing your internet service provider (ISP) from tracking the websites you visit. This prevents online tracking and makes it harder for websites to gather information about your browsing habits.

**How to Set Up a Free VPN on iOS**

Setting up a free VPN on your iOS device is easier than you might think. Here’s a step-by-step guide for beginners who are looking to secure their online activity with a **free VPN for iOS**:

# Step-by-Step Guide for iPhone and iPad Users

1. **Download a VPN App:** The first step is to download a free VPN app from the App Store. Make sure to choose a highly-rated app with positive reviews from real users. Avoid downloading VPN apps from third-party sources, as these may pose security risks.
2. **Install the VPN App:** After the app is downloaded, open it and follow the on-screen instructions to install the app. Most free VPNs will ask for permission to add a VPN configuration to your device. You’ll need to allow this in your device’s settings.
3. **Sign Up or Log In:** Many free VPNs require you to create an account, even if the service is free. Enter your email address and follow the prompts to create your account. If the VPN service doesn’t require sign-up, you can proceed directly to the next step.
4. **Connect to the VPN:** Once the app is installed and configured, you can connect to a VPN server. Free VPNs typically offer a limited number of servers to choose from, so select the one that works best for your location. Some apps allow you to choose the country or region you’d like to connect to, while others may automatically select the best server.
5. **Test the VPN Connection:** Once connected, it’s important to test the VPN to ensure it’s working correctly. You can use websites like “WhatIsMyIP.com” to check if your IP address has changed. If it hasn’t, there may be an issue with the VPN connection.

# Common Troubleshooting Tips

* If the VPN isn’t connecting, make sure you have a stable internet connection.
* If the connection is slow, try switching to a different server or turning off other apps that may be using your internet bandwidth.
* If the VPN app asks for unnecessary permissions or seems suspicious, consider uninstalling it and choosing a different service.

**Top Scenarios for Using a Free VPN on iOS**

A free VPN for iOS is perfect for a variety of scenarios. Let’s look at some of the most common use cases where a VPN can enhance your online experience:

# 1. Browsing on Public Wi-Fi

Public Wi-Fi networks, such as those found in airports, coffee shops, and libraries, are often unsecured and vulnerable to hackers. When connected to these networks, your personal information could be intercepted by cybercriminals. A VPN protects your data from prying eyes, ensuring your internet traffic remains private.

# 2. Accessing Geo-blocked Content

Whether you want to access a show on Netflix, YouTube, or a local news website, a free VPN can help you bypass geographic restrictions. Many streaming platforms and websites restrict content based on the user’s location, but a VPN can make it appear as if you're browsing from a different country, giving you access to a wider range of content.

# 3. Ensuring Privacy on Social Media Apps

Social media platforms often track your activity and personal information to serve you targeted ads. With a VPN, you can mask your IP address and reduce the amount of data collected by social media companies. This ensures that your online activity remains private and secure.

# 4. Secure Online Shopping and Banking

When shopping or managing your finances online, security is essential. A free VPN can protect sensitive information, such as credit card details and passwords, from being intercepted by hackers. Using a VPN on iOS ensures that your transactions are secure, even when using less-than-secure networks.

**Understanding the Limitations of Free VPNs for iOS**

While free VPNs can offer a variety of benefits, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. It's important to weigh these drawbacks before deciding to rely on a free VPN for iOS for your everyday internet browsing.

# 1. Limited Server Locations and Speed

One of the main limitations of free VPNs is that they often provide limited server locations. Paid VPNs typically offer a wide range of server options across the globe, which helps users maintain good connection speeds and access content from different regions. However, free VPNs might restrict the number of servers available, limiting the geographical diversity you can use.

This limitation can also result in slower speeds, as free VPNs have fewer servers, which means they may be more crowded. With many users sharing the same server, your connection can slow down, particularly during peak usage times. For activities like streaming, gaming, or large file downloads, this can be frustrating.

# 2. Data Caps and Bandwidth Restrictions

Free VPNs often come with data caps or bandwidth restrictions. These limits can significantly reduce your ability to browse the internet freely without worrying about running out of data. Some free VPN services provide a certain amount of free data per month (e.g., 500MB or 1GB), and once you hit that limit, your access might be throttled, or you might have to wait until the next month for more data. This can make it difficult to use the VPN for data-heavy activities like streaming, large file downloads, or online gaming.

# 3. Limited Features and Customization

Premium VPN services offer a wide array of advanced features, such as split tunneling, ad-blocking, and multi-device support. Free VPNs, on the other hand, typically offer a basic set of features, with few customization options. If you’re looking for advanced security or the ability to fine-tune your VPN experience, free VPNs may not meet your needs.

Moreover, the lack of features like kill switches (which automatically disconnect you from the internet if the VPN fails) means that your data could be exposed if the VPN connection drops.

# 4. Possible Advertising and Tracking

To compensate for the lack of subscription fees, some free VPN services may display ads or track your browsing behavior. These ads could be intrusive, making your browsing experience less enjoyable. Worse, if the VPN collects data about your activity, it could undermine your privacy rather than protect it.

It's crucial to read the terms and conditions of any free VPN service you use, as some might monetize your data through advertising or other means. Always be cautious if a free service promises something too good to be true.

**The Benefits of Free VPNs for Casual Internet Users**

Despite their limitations, free VPNs are a fantastic option for casual internet users who don’t need to use a VPN extensively but still want to ensure their privacy and security while online. If you're someone who uses the internet casually, for browsing, social media, or checking emails, a free VPN for iOS can offer significant benefits.

# 1. Anonymity for Basic Browsing

Even if you're only using the internet to check social media or browse the web, a free VPN can help protect your anonymity. It masks your IP address, making it more difficult for websites to track your location or online behavior. This added layer of anonymity is valuable, especially if you're concerned about your privacy.

# 2. Accessing Restricted Content

Free VPNs can also help you bypass content restrictions on websites that limit access based on geographical location. Whether it's for streaming a video or accessing news websites from another country, a free VPN can make it appear as though you're browsing from a different region, allowing you to access otherwise blocked content.

# 3. Protecting Your Personal Information on Public Wi-Fi

Public Wi-Fi networks are notorious for their security vulnerabilities. If you're out and about, working on your iPhone in a café, airport, or hotel lobby, a free VPN helps encrypt your connection and protect your personal information from being intercepted by hackers. This is especially important if you're entering sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or bank account information.

# 4. Low Commitment and No Cost

The best part of using a free VPN for iOS is that there's no financial commitment. If you're just looking to add an extra layer of privacy or access a limited amount of geo-blocked content, a free VPN lets you do so without the need for a long-term subscription. You can download it, use it, and uninstall it whenever you wish, all without spending a cent.

**When Should You Consider Upgrading to a Paid VPN?**

While free VPNs are an excellent option for many casual users, there are certain situations where upgrading to a paid VPN might be the better choice. Let’s explore the scenarios where a paid VPN could offer you more value and enhanced features.

# 1. If You Need Faster Speeds for Streaming or Gaming

If you frequently use streaming services or play online games that require a fast and stable internet connection, a free VPN may not provide the performance you need. Free VPNs often come with slow speeds and limited bandwidth, which can result in buffering or lag. A paid VPN, on the other hand, typically offers faster servers with better performance, making it ideal for high-demand activities.

# 2. If You Need Advanced Features

Paid VPNs come with a wider range of advanced features that are not typically available with free VPNs. Features like **split tunneling**, where you can route certain apps or websites outside the VPN, **ad-blocking**, and **multi-device support** are all common with premium VPN services. Additionally, paid services often have a **kill switch**, which protects your data if the VPN connection is unexpectedly dropped.

# 3. If You Need More Server Locations and Unlimited Data

Free VPNs often limit the number of servers you can connect to and impose data caps. If you want more server locations, unlimited data, and faster speeds, upgrading to a paid VPN will give you these perks. This is especially important if you're traveling abroad and need reliable, fast access to services and websites that may be geo-blocked.

# 4. If You Want Stronger Security and Privacy Guarantees

Paid VPNs tend to have stronger security and privacy features, including better encryption standards, a strict no-logs policy, and greater transparency about how your data is handled. If privacy is a major concern for you, investing in a paid VPN that guarantees no data logging and offers strong encryption protocols is an excellent decision.

**Conclusion: Is a Free VPN for iOS Right for You?**

A **free VPN for iOS** can be a great tool for securing your online activity and maintaining your privacy without spending a penny. They are perfect for casual users who don’t need advanced features but still want to protect themselves when browsing on public Wi-Fi or accessing geo-blocked content.

However, as with anything free, there are some trade-offs. Free VPNs often come with limited features, slower speeds, and potential risks to privacy. If you're a heavy internet user, need advanced features, or require faster speeds for gaming or streaming, you may want to consider upgrading to a paid VPN for enhanced performance and security.

Before making your decision, it's important to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of using a free VPN. If you're comfortable with basic protection and don’t mind some limitations, a free VPN for iOS can be an excellent choice to maintain your privacy without breaking the bank.",1,1734280054.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

In today’s digital age, online privacy has become more important than ever. With constant surveillance from both private companies and government agencies, it's easy to feel like your personal data is always at risk. From social media tracking to internet service providers (ISPs) collecting your browsing history, the internet is not always as private as you may think. Fortunately, tools like Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) can help keep your online activity private and secure. But how does a VPN work, and how can it help you browse anonymously on your iPhone or iPad?

A VPN is a tool that routes your internet connection through a secure, private server, hiding your real IP address and encrypting your internet traffic. This makes it much harder for third parties, including hackers, websites, and ISPs, to track your online activity. In this article, we will discuss how you can get a free VPN for iOS, set it up, and browse the internet with complete anonymity.

# What is a VPN and How Does it Work?

**VPN Basics**

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a service that allows you to connect to the internet through a secure, encrypted server. It essentially acts as a middleman between you and the websites you visit, ensuring that your internet traffic is protected from prying eyes. When you use a VPN, your internet traffic is routed through an encrypted tunnel, making it impossible for anyone to intercept your data.

For iOS users, a VPN works similarly to how it would on any other device. It masks your real IP address, giving you a different one based on the VPN server you connect to. This ensures that websites can’t track your real location, providing you with enhanced privacy.

**How VPNs Keep Your Data Safe**

When using a VPN, your online data is encrypted, making it unreadable to anyone who tries to intercept it. This is especially useful when you're using public Wi-Fi, where hackers might try to steal your personal information. VPNs also protect your identity by masking your IP address, which is the unique identifier that can be used to trace your activity back to you.

In addition to this, many VPNs offer features like kill switches, which disconnect your device from the internet if the VPN connection drops. This ensures that your data remains safe even if the VPN fails.

# Understanding Anonymity While Browsing

**What is Online Anonymity?**

Online anonymity means that your identity, location, and online activity are kept secret from others. This is a concept that has grown increasingly important as more and more of our lives are shared and tracked online. Many websites track your behavior using cookies, and advertisers use this data to target you with personalized ads. In some cases, even your Internet Service Provider (ISP) might monitor your activity.

While complete anonymity is difficult to achieve, using a VPN can help protect your identity and reduce the chances of being tracked.

**How VPNs Help Achieve Online Anonymity**

A VPN helps you browse anonymously by masking your real IP address and rerouting your internet connection through an encrypted server. This makes it almost impossible for websites and services to identify your true location or track your browsing habits. With a VPN, you can essentially disappear online, making it difficult for third parties to build a profile on you.

Using a VPN is one of the easiest ways to improve your online anonymity, especially on mobile devices like the iPhone, which are often targets for tracking.

# Free VPN for iOS: Why Consider It?

**What You Should Know About Free VPNs**

When considering a VPN, many users are drawn to the option of a free VPN, especially for mobile devices like iPhones. Free VPN services are appealing because they come at no cost and provide a quick and easy way to start protecting your online privacy. However, it's important to understand that not all free VPNs are created equal.

Free VPNs often come with limitations in terms of speed, server options, and features. While they do offer basic security and privacy, they may not offer the same level of protection as premium services. Additionally, some free VPN providers may even log your data, compromising your privacy.

**Benefits of Using Free VPNs**

Despite the limitations, there are several benefits to using a free VPN, especially for iOS users. First, they provide a low-barrier entry to online privacy. You don’t have to pay anything upfront to protect your privacy while browsing. Many free VPNs also offer simple apps for iOS that are easy to set up and use.

Additionally, free VPNs are a great choice for light internet users who don’t need advanced features like streaming access or high-speed browsing. If you’re mainly looking to secure your browsing and protect your personal information, a free VPN may be sufficient.

# How to Choose the Right Free VPN for iOS

**Key Features to Look For in a Free VPN**

When choosing a free VPN for iOS, there are a few important factors to consider. First, make sure that the VPN provides strong encryption protocols to protect your data. Without strong encryption, your connection may not be secure, leaving your personal data vulnerable to hackers.

Second, check if the VPN offers a no-logs policy. Some free VPNs may track your browsing data, which defeats the purpose of using a VPN in the first place. A no-logs policy ensures that the VPN provider doesn’t collect any data about your online activity.

Additionally, look for VPNs that offer decent speeds, even for free users. While you may experience some slowdown with a free VPN, it shouldn’t be so severe that it disrupts your browsing or streaming experience. Server locations are another consideration—more server options can help you find a faster and more stable connection.

**How to Test VPN Performance on iOS**

After selecting a free VPN, it’s essential to test its performance. You can start by checking the VPN’s speed by running speed tests before and after you connect. This will help you determine if there’s a significant drop in connection speed. If you notice major slowdowns, you may need to try a different server or consider upgrading to a premium service.

Another test is checking if your IP address is masked. You can use online tools to verify if the VPN is successfully hiding your real IP address.

# How to Install a Free VPN on Your iOS Device

**Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up a VPN**

Installing a free VPN on your iPhone or iPad is a straightforward process, but it’s important to follow the right steps to ensure that your VPN is properly set up. Here’s how to do it:

1. **Download the VPN App** The first step is to download the free VPN app from the App Store. Most free VPN services offer their apps directly on the App Store, making it easy to download and install them on your iOS device.
2. **Create an Account (If Required)** After installation, some VPN apps may ask you to create an account, while others will allow you to connect immediately. If creating an account is required, follow the on-screen instructions to register using your email or social media credentials.
3. **Choose a Server Location** Once the app is installed, you’ll typically be prompted to select a server location. This will be the country you appear to be browsing from. If you want to access content restricted to a specific region, select a server in that location.
4. **Connect to the VPN** After selecting the server, simply tap the “Connect” button. The app will begin to establish a secure connection between your device and the selected VPN server. You may be prompted to allow the app to add a VPN configuration to your iOS device, which you should accept for the connection to work.
5. **Confirm VPN Connection** Once connected, you should see a small VPN icon in the top-left corner of your device’s screen, indicating that your internet traffic is now routed through the VPN.

**Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues**

Although setting up a free VPN on your iOS device is usually a smooth process, there can be occasional issues. Here are some common problems you might encounter:

1. **VPN Not Connecting** If your VPN isn’t connecting, it may be due to issues with the server you selected. Try switching to a different server or restarting your iPhone to resolve the issue.
2. **App Crashes or Freezes** If the app is freezing or crashing, ensure that the app is updated to the latest version. Sometimes, reinstalling the app can help solve bugs or crashes.
3. **Device Not Recognizing VPN Configuration** If your iOS device doesn’t recognize the VPN configuration, try removing and re-adding the VPN connection in the iOS settings.
4. **Slow Speeds or Connectivity Issues** VPNs, especially free ones, can sometimes suffer from slower speeds. Try changing the server to a less congested one or switch to a server geographically closer to you for better performance.

# Protecting Your Privacy with a VPN on iOS

**How to Ensure Your VPN is Always On**

One of the best ways to protect your privacy is by ensuring that your VPN remains active at all times while using your iOS device. Many free VPN apps offer an auto-connect feature, which automatically connects you to a VPN server whenever you join a new Wi-Fi network or access the internet.

To enable this feature, check the settings within the VPN app. Make sure the “Always-on” or “Auto-connect” option is turned on. This ensures that your VPN is always running in the background, protecting your privacy without you needing to manually connect each time.

Additionally, consider enabling the “kill switch” feature, if available. This feature disconnects your internet connection if the VPN drops unexpectedly, preventing any data leaks when the VPN connection fails.

**Other Privacy Tips to Consider for iOS Users**

While using a VPN is an important step in securing your privacy, there are other precautions you can take to further enhance your protection. Here are some additional tips for iOS users:

1. **Use Strong Passwords and Two-Factor Authentication** Always use strong, unique passwords for your apps and online accounts. Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security, making it harder for hackers to access your data.
2. **Clear Cookies and Browsing Data Regularly** Even when using a VPN, websites can track your activity through cookies. Regularly clearing your cookies and browsing data will ensure that trackers don’t build up and compromise your privacy.
3. **Use Secure Websites** Always look for the padlock icon in the URL bar before entering personal information on websites. This indicates that the site uses HTTPS encryption, which is a standard for secure browsing.
4. **Update Your iOS Device Regularly** iOS updates often include security patches that fix vulnerabilities in the system. Ensure that your device is up-to-date to keep it safe from potential threats.

# Common Issues with Free VPNs and How to Overcome Them

**Limitations of Free VPNs for iOS**

While free VPNs are a great way to secure your privacy without spending any money, they come with several limitations that you should be aware of:

1. **Limited Server Locations** Free VPNs often have a smaller number of server locations, which can limit your ability to access content from specific regions. Premium VPNs typically offer more server options, giving you more flexibility when it comes to choosing a location.
2. **Slower Speeds** Since free VPNs have a large number of users, their servers can become congested, leading to slower connection speeds. If speed is a priority for you, you might experience buffering or lag when streaming or downloading content.
3. **Data Caps and Usage Limits** Many free VPNs impose daily or monthly data limits. Once you reach the limit, you either have to wait until the next period or upgrade to a paid plan. This can be frustrating for users who need unlimited bandwidth for activities like streaming or large downloads.
4. **Ads and Tracking** Some free VPN services are supported by ads, which can be intrusive and distracting. Additionally, while many free VPNs promise not to track your data, some may still collect information about your usage to serve targeted ads.

**How to Solve Connectivity and Speed Issues**

To overcome some of the limitations of free VPNs, consider the following tips:

1. **Switch Servers** If you’re experiencing slow speeds or connection issues, try switching to a different server. Servers closer to your physical location tend to provide faster speeds.
2. **Use Lightweight Apps** Some VPN apps are more lightweight than others, meaning they have fewer features but run faster. If speed is your main concern, consider using a simple, no-frills VPN app.
3. **Upgrade to Premium (If Necessary)** If you find that the limitations of a free VPN are hindering your online experience, consider upgrading to a premium VPN service. Premium services offer faster speeds, more servers, and additional features like unlimited bandwidth.

# Using a VPN to Browse Anonymously

**How VPNs Mask Your IP Address**

One of the primary benefits of using a VPN is its ability to mask your real IP address. Your IP address is like an online fingerprint that can be used to track your activity across the web. By connecting to a VPN, your real IP address is replaced with the IP address of the VPN server, which makes it difficult for websites, advertisers, and even your ISP to track your online movements.

This is particularly important for maintaining anonymity when browsing the web. Whether you’re accessing sensitive information, researching topics without being tracked, or simply trying to avoid targeted ads, masking your IP address is a crucial step toward greater privacy.

**The Importance of Encryption in Browsing Anonymously**

Encryption is another key feature that allows you to browse anonymously. When your internet traffic is encrypted, it is scrambled in such a way that even if it’s intercepted, it cannot be read by unauthorized parties. This is especially important when using public Wi-Fi networks, where hackers often try to capture sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers.

By using a VPN, you ensure that your browsing activity is encrypted, which adds an additional layer of security to your online presence.

# The Impact of Free VPNs on Your Internet Speed

**Speed Considerations When Using Free VPNs**

One of the major drawbacks of free VPN services is the potential impact on your internet speed. While free VPNs are excellent tools for enhancing privacy and security, they often come with slower speeds compared to premium VPNs. This happens because free VPNs are generally supported by a large number of users, leading to network congestion.

If you notice that your browsing experience is slower than usual after connecting to a free VPN, there are several things you can do to improve your speed. First, choose a server location that is geographically closer to your location. The closer the server, the faster the connection.

Additionally, try using servers that are less crowded or free of heavy traffic, if the VPN app offers such an option.

**How to Minimize Speed Loss**

To minimize speed loss when using a free VPN, consider these tips:

1. **Choose a Faster VPN Server** Opt for servers that are located closer to your physical location. This will typically result in a faster, more stable connection.
2. **Limit Bandwidth-Heavy Activities** If you’re experiencing slow speeds, try limiting activities like streaming or downloading large files while connected to the VPN.
3. **Use the Latest VPN App Version** Ensure that you’re using the latest version of your VPN app, as updates often include performance improvements and bug fixes.

# Free VPNs vs. Paid VPNs: Which is Best for iOS?

**Comparing Free and Paid VPN Features**

When it comes to VPNs, there are two main categories: free and paid. While free VPNs can provide basic privacy and security, paid VPNs typically offer enhanced features and better overall performance. If you’re using an iOS device, understanding the differences between free and paid VPNs is important to make an informed decision.

Free VPNs usually offer limited server locations, slower speeds, and a basic level of encryption. They are a great entry point if you just want to get a feel for VPN services and need something simple for basic browsing or light browsing needs. However, free VPNs may not be ideal for more intensive use cases, such as streaming or accessing geographically restricted content.

Paid VPNs, on the other hand, typically offer better encryption, a wider range of server locations, and faster speeds. Premium services also come with additional features like split tunneling, unlimited bandwidth, and dedicated customer support. Moreover, paid VPNs generally have a strict no-logs policy, which ensures that your data remains completely private.

**What Makes Paid VPNs a Better Option for iOS Users**

Paid VPN services are often the best option for iOS users who require a more robust, reliable, and secure service. With a paid VPN, you will benefit from:

1. **Unlimited Bandwidth**: Unlike free VPNs that often come with data limits, paid services typically offer unlimited bandwidth, making them perfect for activities like streaming, gaming, and downloading large files.
2. **Faster Connection Speeds**: Paid VPNs invest in faster, more powerful servers, which means better overall performance. This is particularly important if you’re accessing content that requires a lot of data, such as HD video streaming.
3. **Access to Streaming Services**: Many free VPNs struggle to unblock streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, or BBC iPlayer. Paid VPNs, however, often have optimized servers that are capable of bypassing geo-blocks and unblocking these services reliably.
4. **Advanced Security Features**: Paid VPNs often provide advanced security features like military-grade encryption, a kill switch, and DNS leak protection, ensuring that your online activity remains completely private and secure.
5. **Dedicated Customer Support**: With paid VPN services, you typically have access to round-the-clock customer support to help resolve any issues you encounter. This level of support is rarely offered by free services.

# Other Benefits of Using a VPN for iOS

**Accessing Geo-Restricted Content**

One of the most popular reasons people use a VPN is to access geo-restricted content. Many websites and streaming platforms restrict access to certain content based on the user’s location. For instance, Netflix offers different libraries depending on which country you’re in. By using a VPN, you can connect to a server in the country of your choice, bypassing these geographical restrictions and accessing a wider array of content.

This is particularly useful for users who travel frequently or live in regions with limited content options. By connecting to a server in a different country, you can enjoy the same services that are available to users in that country, whether it’s access to TV shows, movies, or websites.

**Enhanced Security on Public Wi-Fi Networks**

Public Wi-Fi networks, such as those in coffee shops, airports, or hotels, are notorious for being insecure. Hackers often target public Wi-Fi networks to intercept data, such as passwords, credit card details, and personal information. Using a VPN while connected to public Wi-Fi encrypts your internet connection, making it much more difficult for anyone to eavesdrop on your activity.

Whether you’re checking your bank account, sending sensitive emails, or browsing the web, a VPN adds an extra layer of security, ensuring that your personal data remains protected even on unsecured networks.

# What to Do if Your Free VPN Stops Working

**Basic Troubleshooting Steps for Free VPNs**

It’s not uncommon for a VPN to stop working from time to time. This could be due to server issues, connectivity problems, or app bugs. If your free VPN suddenly stops working on your iOS device, here are some basic troubleshooting steps you can take:

1. **Check Your Internet Connection**: Make sure that you have a stable internet connection before connecting to the VPN. If you’re having connectivity issues, try restarting your Wi-Fi router or switching to mobile data.
2. **Restart the VPN App**: Close the VPN app completely and then relaunch it. Sometimes, simply restarting the app can solve minor issues and restore the connection.
3. **Switch to a Different Server**: If the VPN connection is slow or unreliable, try switching to a different server. Some servers may be overloaded with users, which can cause connection issues.
4. **Reinstall the VPN App**: If restarting the app doesn’t solve the issue, uninstall and reinstall the app. This can help clear up any bugs or glitches in the app that may be causing problems.
5. **Check for App Updates**: Ensure that you’re using the latest version of the VPN app. Developers frequently release updates that address performance issues and security vulnerabilities.

**When to Consider Switching VPNs**

If troubleshooting doesn’t resolve the issue, it may be time to consider switching to a different free VPN provider or even upgrading to a premium VPN. If your current free VPN consistently fails to provide the level of service you need, a new VPN could offer a better connection, faster speeds, and more reliable service. Before making the switch, ensure that you review the new VPN’s features and check user reviews for reliability.

# Conclusion: Stay Safe, Anonymous, and Secure Online

**Recap of Key Points**

In this digital age, online privacy is becoming increasingly difficult to protect. A VPN offers an effective way to secure your online activity, mask your IP address, and browse the internet anonymously. While free VPNs provide a basic level of protection, they come with limitations such as slower speeds, fewer server options, and potential security risks.

For iOS users, free VPNs are an accessible and low-cost option for basic privacy needs. However, if you’re looking for better speeds, more features, and advanced security, a paid VPN is likely a better choice. No matter what type of VPN you choose, it’s crucial to stay vigilant about your online privacy and take steps to protect your personal information.

**Final Thoughts on Using Free VPNs on iOS**

While free VPNs are a great way to dip your toes into the world of online privacy, they are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Whether you choose a free or paid VPN, it’s important to understand the limitations and trade-offs associated with each option. By choosing the right VPN for your needs and ensuring that it’s properly set up, you can significantly enhance your online security and privacy on your iOS device.

With the increasing risks to online privacy, taking action to protect your data is more important than ever. So, make sure to evaluate your options, test out a few free VPNs, and decide what works best for you.",1,1734279951.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

I inspected my knits, and there isn't any visible damage yet. 

I ended up putting a bunch of glue traps in the closet, and have caught a few moths, but I also got cedar rings for the hangers, cedar planks that hang between garments, and got some pure Eastern red cedar oil, which I used to refresh the older cedar goodies I had in my closet. I also took some chemex coffee filter paper, saturated it in cedar oil, cut it into strips, and hung those strips in my closet. 

Will this be sufficient? There's so much cedar and cedar oil in my closet that you can smell it, through the closed door, from a few feet away. I know cedar won't kill moths, but is typically just a repellent. There is so much cedar and cedar oil that my sweaters now smell like I used cedar oil as cologne. It's actually rather nice. 

Will the actions I've taken work? Should I take all my sweaters, seal them in vacuum bags, and freeze them? 

I'm REALLY trying to avoid mothballs, as the smell of naphthalene makes me sick to my stomach (I take numerous medications that can cause nausea, my sense of smell is super sensitive, and smells can straight up make me puke). If my sweaters smelled like mothballs, I wouldn't be able to wear them without vomiting. 

It doesn't seem like I'm at the level of a full on infestation, as I've only seen 3 or 4 adult moths in the past month. I just want to head this off before it gets out of control and I start losing expensive knits. ",1,1734279938.0,pestcontrol,1,1.0,False

Gambling, sports, drinks, people having a great time... What's not to love? 

Well, I'll tell you:

Once in a while, someone arrives loaded. You may wonder why security even let this guy in but who cares? They'll probably dump a few buyins. Well, that's exactly what happened. 

First of all, what a piece of shit. Rude to the dealers, womanizing the two female players at the table, drinking doubles and spilling half. The floor knows he's been a nuisance because I see them hovering, watching this guy, but there hasn't been anything said yet.

Time for the hand history:

So this Affliction t-shirt wearing, chicken wing eating asshole (CO) calls a $10 raise from a lovely elderly woman (UTG), heads up.

Flop Q82r

OLC check

Affliction bets $5, throwing this chip 15 feet in the air

OLC calls

Turn 9o

OLC check

Saucy bets $10

Old Lady Coffee calls again

River Ten

Lady shoves her entire $47 stack all in
Drunkard snap calls and immediately shows a Queen 

This sweet old woman proudly flips over her top set of Queens and the table is ecstatic with joy.

But then, the dude to the left of the drunk with a smug look on his face (and some bbq sauce), flips over his second card: Jack, for the straight. 

Right away, the floor steps in, as they were watching this hand closely. Apparently the player on drunkards right peeked at the Jack before the reveal. The floor rules his hand dead and OLC gets to rake a pot big enough for her own single cup Keurig machine. 

Drunk guy begins flipping out, yelling to check the cameras, that he'll call his lawyer daddy, etc. Eventually escorted from the poker room.",0,1734279802.0,poker,4,0.18,False

For ages, wood-made furniture has been a common sight in households, and it makes sense. These items are a favorite among both homeowners and design enthusiasts since they blend usefulness, style, and durability. [Wood-crafted furniture](https://woodcraftedfurniture.shop/) offers something for everyone, whether you're searching for a statement piece or something exquisite yet practical. Let's look at some of the most well-liked wood-crafted furniture styles that can improve your house.

**1. Dining Tables: The Center of the House**

Nothing unites people more than a dining table made of solid wood. These tables, which are made from sturdy woods like mahogany, walnut, or oak, not only last over time but also provide your dining area with coziness and personality. To make your table a real conversation starter, look for hand-carved details or live-edge motifs.

**2. Coffee Tables: A Blend of Style and Function**  
A coffee table made of wood can serve as the focal point of your living area and provide useful storage or exhibition space. There is a wood coffee table for every taste, ranging from rustic farmhouse designs to mid-century modern forms. For a unique and sustainable piece, choose reclaimed wood.

**3. Bed Frames: Cozy and Durable**  
The height of style and durability may be found in wooden bed frames. Wooden bed frames combine style and use, whether they are a simple platform bed or a beautifully carved four-poster. 

**4. Cabinets and Consoles: Add Style and Function**  
Give your home a unique touch with wooden cabinets and consoles. Use a pine sideboard or a solid oak TV console as a striking decorative accent while enjoying its practical storage features. Distinctive grain patterns and hand-finished details make these pieces even more special!

**5. Benches and Chairs: Bring Comfort and Charm**  
Transform your space with versatile wooden seating. Place Windsor chairs in your dining room to seamlessly blend modern and traditional styles. Add a rustic vibe to your hallway or garden with a bench crafted from reclaimed wood.

**6. Shelving Units: Stylish Storage Solutions**   
Wood shelving systems are durable and aesthetically pleasing, whether they are floating shelves or massive bookcases. Popular woods for shelves are walnut for a smooth, polished appearance and pine for a rustic feel.  
**Why Make Furniture Out of Wood?**  
Timeless Beauty: Each item is distinct due to the wood's inherent grains and textures.  
Durability: Furniture made of high-quality wood can endure for decades or even generations.  
Versatility: You can incorporate wood furniture into almost any design style, from minimalist to eclectic.  
Eco-Friendly: To lessen their influence on the environment, several wood furniture manufacturers employ recycled or sustainable materials.

Well, upon reaching for it this morning I found what looked to be mold or dust around the buttons and some white residue on the wires. The ‘brown dirt’ around the buttons has always kinda been there for years.

I absolutely LOVE my SO and I'm not mad at him over this at all. But from the first hour soent with this buddy of his, I knew he is an asshole, and I haven't figured out how to tell my SO I can't stand him, and don't know if I should. This guy lives in another state, and hell, I may never see him again.

I have a low tolerance for people who make fun of others to be funny, even if it's ""just a joke."" He's made fun of my SO a lot. This guy is so arrogant. You can't say a damn thing without him turning it into, ""yeah well I know more than you about that haha, let me explain it to you because I'm right and you're wrong."" And he's ao blunt about it. 

LIKE LITERALLY anything my boyfriend says this guy has a rebuttal for, or just straight up says ""HA, well that's because you make poor decisions"" or ""that's because you didn't plan it right, let me explain how I would do it and why it's better."" SO FUCKING ANNOYING. I've had it lol. He justifies being an asshole, and knows he's being a dick to ""be funny."" But it's just not funny to me. 

He's an influencer who in my opinion doesn't deserve his fan base because he's actually just an arrogant loser who has opinions and is lazy so he just puts out low quality content but then also still tries to give advice on shit. Because he has fans, he thinks he's doing everything right.

Anddd he name drops. Like he name dropped/told some BS stories about how he knows some super cool people and I just see right through all of it. Like he's ao insecure and trying to prove he's cool all the time but he's an ass about it all.

Like does it even matter though? I am angry, but I think it's just because I'm so tired of dealing with people I don't want to deal with. This guy makes me want to throw a punch lol.
