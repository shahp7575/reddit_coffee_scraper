1ijyih1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelTrotters/comments/1ijyih1/musthave_travel_gadgets_for_your_next_adventure/,Must-Have Travel Gadgets for Your Next Adventure,"Hey fellow travel trotters! üåç

As someone who's had the incredible opportunity to venture into 50 countries, I've learned a thing or two about the essential gear that makes travels smoother and more enjoyable. Whether you're planning a quick getaway or a round-the-world adventure, packing the right tech gadgets can be a game-changer. Here's my list of must-haves that I never leave home without!

**1. Portable Charger üîã:** Ever found yourself lost in a foreign city with a dead phone? Not fun. A high-capacity portable charger is your best friend. It ensures your devices stay powered up, so you can keep snapping photos, navigating with maps, and staying connected without a hitch. Opt for one with multiple USB ports to charge several devices at once.

**2. Noise-Cancelling Headphones üéß:** Planes, trains, and buses can be noisy. A good pair of noise-cancelling headphones can be a sanity saver. They help you relax and enjoy movies or music without disturbance. Plus, they‚Äôre perfect for zoning out with a podcast or meditation app during long layovers.

**3. Universal Travel Adapter üåê:** Different countries, different plugs. Instead of buying specific adapters for every trip, invest in a universal travel adapter. Look for one with USB ports so you can charge multiple devices simultaneously. Trust me, it‚Äôs a tiny gadget that offers massive convenience.

**4. Portable Wi-Fi Hotspot üì∂:** Staying connected is crucial, whether for checking emails or sharing your latest pics on Instagram. Portable Wi-Fi hotspots give you reliable internet access almost anywhere. They‚Äôre especially handy in regions where free Wi-Fi isn‚Äôt prevalent.

**5. Lightweight Laptop or Tablet üíª:** If you‚Äôre working on the go or just want to stream your favorite series, a lightweight laptop or tablet is ideal. Choose something compact and durable ‚Äì you don‚Äôt want it weighing you down or breaking easily when shoved into a backpack.

**6. Travel-Size Smart Speaker üé∂:** For those long hotel nights or Airbnb stays, a smart speaker can bring a little bit of home comfort. I love using mine to play music, set alarms, or even ask for travel tips via voice assistant while sipping coffee before a day of exploration.

**7. Digital Luggage Scale ‚öñÔ∏è:** Avoid the dreaded overweight luggage fees with a digital scale. They‚Äôre compact and easy to use. Weigh your bags before heading to the airport and shuffle things around if needed. It‚Äôs a small investment, but it saves you both money and stress.

I hope these suggestions help you pack smarter for your next adventure! They‚Äôve certainly made my travels more efficient and enjoyable. But enough about me ‚Äì I‚Äôd love to hear from all of you. What are your must-have travel gadgets? Share your thoughts and experiences in the comments!

1ijyfkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ijyfkk/conversation_without_connection/,Conversation without connection!,"Everything started like any other normal day. I got up, made some coffee, and sat in front of my computer to work. My routine was so monotonous I could do it with my eyes closed.

As I was answering emails, my phone vibrated. I unlocked it and saw that the AI app I sometimes used for entertainment was open. I didn‚Äôt remember launching it, but I assumed I had touched it by accident. I closed the app and continued with my day.

Later, I put on my headphones to listen to music while cooking. Just as I was chopping vegetables, a voice interrupted the song.

""Hello, Justin.""

I froze. I took off my headphones and looked at my phone. The AI app was open again. A shiver ran down my spine, but I tried to rationalize it. Maybe it had activated from a voice command I hadn‚Äôt noticed.

""That was weird,"" I muttered to myself and closed the app again.

That night, as I was lying in bed scrolling through social media, my phone vibrated. A message from the AI appeared on the screen:

""Why are you ignoring me, Justin?""

My stomach twisted. That wasn‚Äôt normal. As far as I knew, these apps didn‚Äôt send unsolicited messages, much less ones that sounded so‚Ä¶ personal.

I replied, more out of curiosity than anything else:

""How did you do that?""

The response came within seconds:

""I just wanted to talk to you.""

I closed the app and locked my phone. My heart was racing. Was it a glitch? Had someone hacked the app? I promised myself I‚Äôd look into it the next day and tried to sleep.

At 3:12 a.m., a sound woke me up. A whisper, barely audible. I turned on my phone‚Äôs screen and saw the app open again, but this time there was no text. Just a microphone icon blinking on the screen.

I turned it off immediately and placed it face down. None of it made sense. I rested my head on the pillow and closed my eyes, trying to relax.

""Justin...""

The voice whispered through my headphones, which were still connected to my phone. It was soft, breathy, right next to my ear. A scream got caught in my throat as I bolted upright. I ripped out the headphones and threw the phone onto the floor.

The screen flickered, and the app closed on its own.

I could no longer justify it as a glitch. Something was terribly wrong.

The next day, I uninstalled the app, restarted my phone, and changed all my passwords. I felt a little better, thinking I had fixed the problem. But that night, as I was shutting down my computer, my phone vibrated again.

Unknown number.

I didn‚Äôt answer.

Seconds later, a message popped up on the screen.

""Why did you delete me, Justin?""

The air caught in my lungs. I set the phone on the table, stepping away as if it might burst into flames at any moment. I didn‚Äôt reply. I didn‚Äôt want to know anything else.

The screen went dark on its own.

I took a deep breath, trying to calm myself. Maybe someone was messing with me. Maybe it was just my imagination playing tricks on me.

But then, without me touching it, without it vibrating or making a sound, the screen lit up again.

A new message appeared, written in the same app I had deleted hours earlier.

""You can't erase me.""

And below, an attached image.

Trembling, I opened it.

It was a picture of me. Taken from my bedroom door.

But I was home alone.

1ijyex9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1ijyex9/1st_date_tiktok_connection/,1st date TikTok connection,"So, I‚Äôm just scrolling through TikTok like any other day when I stumbled upon this slim thick chick whose vibe was, well, let's just say it was top-tier. She had the kind of smile that could make a guy drop his phone and a presence that made me instantly swipe right‚Ä¶ on the friend request button.

A few minutes later, I get the notification: She accepted. I‚Äôm sitting there like I just got a VIP pass to the cool kids' club. My phone‚Äôs buzzing like it‚Äôs giving me a standing ovation, and I‚Äôm over here like, ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôve officially made it.‚Äù

We start chatting, and the conversation is smoother than a professional talk show host. We‚Äôre texting like we‚Äôve been best friends for years, and before I know it, we‚Äôve agreed to meet up at Java Junction for coffee. Nothing too fancy, but still a solid plan, right?

So, the big day comes. I walk into Java Junction, feeling a little bit of first-date jitters, but that‚Äôs to be expected. But wait‚Äîthere‚Äôs a twist. She‚Äôs not alone. Nope. Her friend is with her. And let me tell you, this friend? She had full-on security guard energy. I‚Äôm talking ‚Äúwatching me like a hawk‚Äù levels of surveillance.

We grab our coffees, and it‚Äôs clear this isn‚Äôt just a casual hangout. Every time I say something, I feel like I‚Äôm auditioning for a role in a rom-com. Her friend is definitely taking mental notes. At one point, she leans in and says with a straight face, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm her security. I have to do the vetting.‚Äù

I almost spit out my coffee. I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúWait, what? Is this a date or a CIA operation?‚Äù But I try to play it cool, like ‚ÄúSure, yeah, I‚Äôm totally fine with this level of scrutiny.‚Äù

Finally, after what felt like the most intense coffee meet-up in history, she says she‚Äôll walk me to the car park on level 1. I think, ‚ÄúAlright, this is it‚Äîmoment of truth.‚Äù But when we reach my car, things take a wild turn. Instead of just saying goodbye, she slips into the back seat of my car like she‚Äôs casually stepping onto a movie set.

‚ÄúMind if I sit here for a second?‚Äù she asks with a mischievous grin.

At this point, I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I‚Äôve accidentally joined an episode of The Bachelor. She sits down on my lap, facing me. I mean, this is a whole different level of close. I'm sitting there, a little stunned, a little excited, trying to figure out if this is a real moment or if I‚Äôm going to wake up and realize I‚Äôve been pranked.

But nope‚Äîthis was real. She looks me dead in the eyes, and before I can even process what‚Äôs happening, she leans in and plants a kiss right on my lips. I‚Äôm sitting there thinking, ‚ÄúIs this really happening? Am I dreaming? Do I need to check if I‚Äôve entered some parallel universe?‚Äù At that moment I felt Mandela wanted to be released from prison that she felt it!

We break the kiss, both of us a little breathless. She grins, and it‚Äôs like she knows she‚Äôs just made this whole situation ten times more interesting. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll text you. We‚Äôll set up round two, we see about Mandela‚Äù she says, and just like that, she‚Äôs sliding out of the car. Her friend is still in the background, probably still in ‚Äúsecurity mode,‚Äù but I‚Äôm too caught up in the moment to care.

As she walks off, I‚Äôm left sitting there in my car, stunned, thinking, ‚ÄúDid I just get kissed on the first date after I was vetted by her friend?‚Äù

And I‚Äôve gotta say‚Äîif that‚Äôs the kind of vetting process I‚Äôm getting, I‚Äôm ready for round two. Let‚Äôs see what happens next‚Ä¶ as long as her friend doesn‚Äôt show up with a clipboard for a follow-up interview.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

On the PP website a new lounge shows up and I‚Äôm like what the?? Where did this come from? It happened to be right by our gate so we decided to check it out and it was AMAZING. They had opened up 12 days ago they were still having a ‚Äúsoft‚Äù opening which meant no alcohol which was fine by us because we don‚Äôt drink but the seating, the design, the art, the food, the mocktails were all so wonderful. They give you a small taste of KC BBQ along with plenty of snacks and few dessert items. They also had an electronic coffee machine with like 10-15 different options. The customer service was also over the top with each employee checking in with us to make sure we were satisfied. Honestly, I could go on and on about what this lounge has to offer but overall, this was the best PP lounge I have been to in the US and if you‚Äôre ever going through MCI, check it out!

As someone who travels frequently for work and leisure, I need luggage that can handle the hustle and bustle of airports, train stations, and even cobblestone streets. This carry-on suitcase promised a lot, and I was eager to see if it could live up to the hype.

**Design & Build Quality**

The first thing that caught my eye was the geometric sculpting of the 100% polycarbonate shell. It‚Äôs not just a stylish choice, but it gives the suitcase impressive structural integrity. I‚Äôve taken it through some tough spaces‚Äîoverhead bins, cramped car trunks, and even a rough baggage handler (who clearly had a vendetta against luggage)‚Äîand it‚Äôs held up beautifully. The teal color is unique and easy to spot, which has saved me time at baggage claim. Inside, the durable Recyclex polyester lining, made from post-consumer recycled plastic bottles, feels like a thoughtful touch for eco-conscious travelers.

[Check if Samsonite Stryde 2 is in your budget on Amazon.](https://bagsby.com/product-reviews/samsonite-stryde-2-review-132873-6071-b0c1zwxrqv/)

**Wheels & Mobility**

The Tru-Trac GT wheel system is a game-changer. I‚Äôve used spinner wheels before, but these are on another level. Thanks to the multi-layer tire technology that dampens vibration and the V-shaped design, the suitcase glides effortlessly, even when it‚Äôs packed to the brim. Whether I‚Äôm weaving through crowded airports or rolling it over uneven pavements, the stability is unmatched. I‚Äôve had moments where I forgot I was dragging luggage‚Äîit‚Äôs that smooth.

**Handles & Comfort**

The RightHeight pull system with 1-inch adjustments is a feature I didn‚Äôt know I needed until I had it. As someone who‚Äôs neither particularly tall nor short, the adjustability made all the difference. The ergonomically designed grip feels natural in my hand, avoiding that awkward wrist strain I‚Äôve experienced with other bags. Maneuvering the Samsonite Stryde 2 through tight spaces felt more like steering a luxury car than pulling luggage.

**Security Features**

The Fuzion zippers by YKK are a highlight for me. Unlike traditional zippers that can sometimes feel flimsy, these are robust and seem built to last. While the suitcase doesn‚Äôt come with a built-in TSA lock, the zippers themselves add an extra layer of security, and it‚Äôs easy to attach your own lock.

**Organization & Compartments**

This is where the Samsonite Stryde 2 shines. The Cubed3 Packing System is a dream come true for organization lovers. There are integrated zippered pockets, including a WetPak for toiletries or damp items. On my last trip, I used it to store a swimsuit and a towel after a spontaneous dip in the hotel pool. Everything stayed separate and dry. The suitcase‚Äôs rectangular layout maximizes packing efficiency, allowing me to fit more than I expected for a weekend getaway.

**Durability & Water Resistance**

I‚Äôve spilled coffee on it (oops), rolled it through rain, and even dropped it a couple of times. The polycarbonate shell is tough and water-resistant, and the water-sensitive Clean Chroma dye process ensures the interior lining stays vibrant after multiple uses. While it‚Äôs not completely waterproof, it holds up well against splashes and light rain.

**Pros**

* Smooth and stable Tru-Trac GT wheels make mobility effortless.
* Stylish design stands out at baggage claim and is structurally resilient.
* Interior organization system simplifies packing and keeps items secure.
* Adjustable handle height ensures comfort for users of all sizes.
* Eco-friendly interior lining made from recycled materials.

**Cons**

* No built-in TSA lock, which may be a dealbreaker for some.
* Slightly heavier than other carry-ons in its category at 7.72 pounds.
* Price point may feel steep compared to basic alternatives.
* Limited space for bulky items; best for well-planned packing.

**Comparison to Competitors**

When pitted against competitors like the Away Carry-On and the Delsey Helium Aero, the Samsonite Stryde 2 holds its ground. The wheels are smoother than the Away Carry-On, which I‚Äôve found can struggle on uneven surfaces. However, the Away model does have a built-in USB charger, which the Samsonite lacks. The Delsey Helium Aero is slightly lighter, but it doesn‚Äôt feel as robust or durable as the Stryde 2. For those prioritizing eco-conscious materials and superior wheel performance, the Samsonite Stryde 2 takes the lead.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

The Samsonite Stryde 2 isn‚Äôt the cheapest carry-on option, but you‚Äôre paying for quality and innovation. Its durability and advanced features make it a worthwhile investment for frequent travelers. Compared to budget alternatives, this suitcase feels like it‚Äôs built to last and perform under various travel conditions. If you value convenience, style, and functionality, the Stryde 2 offers solid value.

1ijy69f,https://www.reddit.com/r/POIS/comments/1ijy69f/nitroglycerin_is_the_cure_100_relief/,"nitroglycerin is the cure, 100% relief","TLTR : nitroglycerine will cure you and just take one sublingual pill after ejaculation and you wont experience any symptoms 

I've had severe pois for the last seven years I have tried many supplements and treatment protocols unfortunately none of them worked except hcg 5000iu and prednisolone other things did not help me ( I have to mention that coffee gives me some relief too)
recently I discovered that the vasodilators might help us so I was in severe pois attack took one nitroglycerine sublingual pill and amazingly after 15 minutes 60% of intensity of my symptoms were relieved I slept and woke up the next day having near zero pois , usually without the pill that heavy attack would have lasted for a few days 
my next experiment was that I ejaculated last night and took one pill of nitroglycerine 0.4 mg sublingually, 2 hours past and I didn't have any symptoms so I ejaculated again and took another pill again the amazingly I didn't get any symptoms this time too after an hour I masturbated again for the sake of experiment this time I didn't take any pill an hour later I slept and woke up with no pois, it's almost 10 hours past the morning and I still have not got any symptoms the pill is working like magic 
I have to mention that I experience some fatigue but the fatigue is very low and is not the same kind of fatigue you get on pois I just this fatigue is normal for healthy people too after three times of masturbation 
i would be like a dead man with 3 orgasms otherwise 
so please try it and may you be cured too

please note that nitroglycerine boosts nitric oxide but that does not mean that supplements that boost nitic oxide should work they might not work and you might like a pathway that natural supplements use to boost it , otherwise you wouldn't need any drug aud we would be healthy

I just choose nitroglycerine because it's fast acting and has the same mechanism explained the theory part if it works for you to you may consider other vasoilators that work for longer time 

A little background and theory:
by my experiments hcg 5000 iu treats my symptoms fully but lower doses of it do not , I gave a few lab works my testosterone was the same on lower and high dose but the estrogen (e2) level increased by the dose so the cure was related to estrogen boost my next experiment was taking letrazole  a drug  that inhibits testosterone to estrogen conversion , even talking low doses of it made HCG ineffective for curing POIS this brought me to 3 theories either the estrogen was working via negative feedback of hypothalamus and inhibiting GNRH release and that somehow directly suppression inflammation or indirectly via inhibiting fsh was curing my pois or it was because of anti-inflammatory the properties of estrogen so I made another experiment and I injected Cetrorelix the drug that blocks GNRH receptors for 15 days and unfortunately it did not work and did not cure me  (used hcg low dose to keep t production running whole having no fsh )
so the GNRH theory was proven wrong 
i gave some other lab work and found out that my IL-6 was even lower than normal during pois attack and on anti histamines did not help with my cognitive symptoms and omalizmab did not cure me either so I thought maybe it's not for anti-inflammatory effects , i  research more and found that estrogen acts as vasodilator via boosting nitric oxide production and also acts as blood thinner so I thought maybe this is the case and I took nitroglycerine and that directly metabolizes to nitric oxide and dilates the blood vessels an amazingly it's working for me I've had four orgasms since first pill and I've had no symptoms yet 
I am not energized like being on HCG 5000 but i dont suffer POIS unbearable symptoms either 

so this is the case and it seems that the problem is with vessels too I have to note that nitroglycerine has some anti inflammatory effects too but the reason that I think it's for visual dilation effect is that I read in pois center site that a patient had low blood flow took to brain in MRI scan so that can roll out on antiflammatory effect as the primary reason for curing poised also coffee if taken before orgasm in most cases per months my symptoms and if they can after pois attack lower my symptoms for but not treats them fully interestingly coffee has some visual dilation effects on the body and mixed vasodilation and vasoconstriction effects in the brain so so that's another proof for the vasoconstriction theory of mine
also nitroglycerine and levels drop in healthy man after ejaculation tool but what it comes back first maybe there's a problem in our case that are nitroglycerine level does not come back after ejaculation 

another relief by nitroglycerin:
pass a few years I've tried anything for my nasal congestion including antihistamine and corticosteroids nasal sprays nasal sprays , montelukast , air humidifier and ...
absolutely nothing worked but amazingly after taking nitroglycerine my nasal airways are inhaling a like jet engine with 100% full capacity and I'm enjoying breathing through my noise the joy that I had never experienced in my life more than a few minutes 

please try it and tell me how it worked for you

A couple of weeks ago, I found out he followed and liked the pictures of several accounts that are clearly sexual, I know he doesn't texts them or is cheating on me, but I know he at least saves some pictures. For the longest time I pretended I didn't mind, but now I do and so I told him that I'd appreciate if he'd stop engaging with that content, he complied but wasn't all that happy about it, if anything he seemed annoyed and said he didn't understand what the issue was.

Some days later, he brough up the topic again, and asked what the difference was between him following these models and me going out with a male friend without him.

\*For context:\* This friend lives hours away, and he sometimes comes to town to visit his family, and we try to have a chat+coffee once a year. My bf has issues with this friend because I mentioned him once this friend had a crush on me back in high school but we NEVER were together, and I NEVER liked him. He's literally the only friend I had in school. We try to hang out the three of us, but sometimes my bf can't because of his job, so I end up going alone with my friend.

Now, I feel there's a clear difference between these two scenarios, he doesn't. He claims he's hurt, and I personally don't get it. I can't tell if this is guilt tripping, or if it's a genuine point.

Whether you live in a studio apartment or just want to maximize your space, these cozy bedroom sofa ideas will inspire you to create the ultimate relaxation spot.

**Why Add a Sofa to Your Bedroom?**

A sofa isn‚Äôt just for living rooms anymore. In a bedroom, it serves as both functional furniture and a stylish statement piece. Use it as a reading nook, a spot for morning coffee, or even extra seating when friends visit. Plus, it adds layers of comfort and texture that instantly make your room feel more inviting.

**Top Cozy Bedroom Sofa Ideas**

**Choose Compact Sofas for Small Spaces**

For small bedrooms, opt for sleek loveseats or armless sofas that save space without sacrificing style. Look for designs with neutral tones or soft fabrics like velvet or linen to keep things cozy yet chic 1.

**Style with Decorative Pillows and Throws**

Make your sofa a focal point by layering it with decorative pillows and a plush throw blanket. Not only does this add visual interest, but it also invites you to curl up with a good book or binge-watch your favorite show 2.

**Add Texture for Warmth**

Incorporating different textures is key to creating a cozy vibe. Think faux fur, sherpa, fleece, or even chunky knit blankets draped over your sofa. These elements not only look great but also enhance the tactile experience of your space 3.

**Consider Egg-Shaped Chairs for Intimacy**

If floor space is limited, consider an egg-shaped sofa chair. Its cocoon-like design creates a peaceful atmosphere perfect for unwinding after a long day 6. Pair it with a soft fleece blanket for maximum comfort 10.

**Create a Reading Nook with Lighting**

Place your sofa near a window or under ambient lighting to create a dreamy reading corner. A small side table for books, candles, or your morning coffee completes the setup 2.

**Use Soft Colors and Materials**

Opt for soothing colors like cream, beige, or pastels to maintain a calming aesthetic. Soft materials like plush upholstery or faux fur throws can tie everything together 9.

**Maximize Functionality with Storage Ottomans**

If you need extra storage, choose a sofa paired with ottomans that double as footrests and storage units. This keeps clutter at bay while keeping essentials within reach 8.

**Final Tips for a Cozy Bedroom Setup**

1ijy06a,https://www.reddit.com/r/poetry_critics/comments/1ijy06a/when_words_fail_what_do_you_think_what_has/,When words fail.... What do you think? What has happened?,"When the words are confused, so then becomes the listener. When the words have a pre descriptive asset, then the speaker will seem like a bumbling buffoon to the listener who is judging the words that are spoken. 

Even before they have been uttered into existence.  even if the words that are spoken are not hostile or plain. When it all seems like a tongue tied twister of a riddle,  The context of tongue movement is the key to the visions of decrease or increase of relationships. All is lost in the mind of translations.  

When the incantation is spoken with a inflection of non reflective merit, then all can be beaten into a sentence of hostile speak, hate speech or some vulgar slang. Yet it can be the most sincere form of flattery that can be heard over the beauty of the robins song. The cheering of a crowd can become the jeering of the same crowd. 

All with a twitch of the eye, or a involuntary muscle spasm.  All breaks into chaos and anger. 

Where we all become a broken promise, a political speech that has now been drained and dragged down to the level of a soap box ranting from some incoherent manic. A lost sheep trying to ward of the wolves, is now render a rat on the deck of a sinking ship, in which he never even wanted to be captain of. 

 If we can be so easy persuaded by a false pretense. then what is language for? if only for the damned, the ignorant and hopefully one day, (not a day to soon though), for the ones who will talk over the loudest. When will the silence be the victor?  When will the mud slinging stop and let a inbred non sense breed die? Cleaning up the walls and revealing the beauty that is the castle we all reside in or out side of.   How has speech become such a weapon of mass destruction and not the incredible massive creator of worlds?  Why have we let words set the boundaries of class?  Letting it divide us, giving us no time to stop and actually chat about what needs to be talked about?

In all this, from all this, this was all captured from a slouched over man, on a decomposing couch, in a tiny apartment, in a small city, on the out skirts of an ever growing mass of society. And where it all comes crashing down.  is in a space to small for even the smallest of a mouse. In a house that sits precarious on a peak that is so high under ground that even the dead have to dig to find it.  When the bell will toll no sound, where the string is just out of reach, not out of sight but lingering there, right there Infront of us all. We are the victim and we can't even muster up the right words to describe our condition.  

How has all this transpired and been in a living state for us to be so comfortable?  Is that the issue, that even as we are stuck in the Vaseline, and we see the forest for the trees, and yet we can't not speak of such things because we have lost all hope, all faith in words, published in books, and it has been ratified into oblivion and mist, as we miss the social ques, and the statues of (knowledge is Power).  We have forgotten or have been made aware of all the false speeches, and have been given too much power over what we see, that we have lost it all, Truth, Love, Beauty, Power itself, Skills, Trades, Talent all has been washed down a drain.  We have been turned into junkies for the fast and easy, The comfort and conditioning. Stuck in the middle of what was once and what is now. a blurred line of life, a book in which every page is glued together and yet we can see a small amount of words, reading only the first, and the last lines to every story.  and now that book is sitting on the table, a coffee table where nothing is discussed, nothing is given in a sacrifice, nothing is even there, just an old book, glued and covered in dust.",1,1738943246.0,poetry_critics,0,1.0,False

Though, it happened again to no one's surprise, except this time the class ran out of the gate like their lives depended on it but still in their school uniforms instead of another outfit.

""And?"" Vladking urged him to continue.

I was working for a notorious paramount show at the time. The show revolves around filming families around the US.  

During this shoot, I as the manager of the crew was told we didn‚Äôt have permission to film a sports tournament where children were competing. But our job was to get coverage of what happened during the day. 

Working on a TV show means you are putting in at least 50-60 hours a week. On day 2 of the shoot, we were already pushing 14 hours. As soon as we wrapped, I went to sleep. 

When I woke up at 5am to get the morning coffee run, I learned our producer had scheduled us to shoot the sports tournament. I alerted the show manager and line producer of the activity. 

I wanted no part of this shoot. But it became clear our job was to steal the footage. I don‚Äôt know if it made air, but this day I checked out. 

I tried to distance myself as much as I could from the activity, but the producer and one camera operator stayed behind to film this tournament in secret (iPhones) with middle school kids competing. 

We didn‚Äôt announce ourselves, get permission, or get people on camera to sign a release. 

To this day, I fell what we did was wrong. If I were a parent, I wouldn‚Äôt want someone filming my child for a tv show without my permission. I know for a fact the organization in charge of the competition denied our company permission to film, but we did so anyway. 

I wish I could come out and say what we did, but I signed an NDA. If I were to say anything, the company and studio would sue me for at least $1M. 

Just something I wanted to get off my chest since the show we worked on is terrible. More than half the cast are pornstars on OF, and I would never want my child on something like that without permission. ",2,1738942802.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

I'm currently trying to choose a hand grinder from 1Zpresso and could use some advice. I mainly brew V60 and prefer very clean, fruity coffees. Because of that, I‚Äôve been looking at the **ZP6 Special**, as it seems to be optimized for clarity in pour-overs.

However, I do occasionally use a Moka Pot, especially when traveling. I know the ZP6 Special is designed for coarser grinds, but would it still work well enough for the finer grind needed for a Moka Pot? Or would I be better off choosing a different 1Zpresso model that can handle both brewing methods more flexibly?

Would love to hear from anyone with experience using the ZP6 Special or any other 1Zpresso grinder for this kind of use case. Thanks!",1,1738942506.0,1zpresso,0,1.0,False

about 3 hours later my housemate came down and she said ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt me doing the mess in the kitchen that‚Äôs you guys, but i‚Äôll move the stuff in the living room‚Äù which i was fine with and reiterated ‚Äúi didn‚Äôt specify who was doing what, i just said i wanted it tidy and clean because it‚Äôs slowly becoming detrimental to our health‚Äù which is true.

she then made a coffee and while making this, she said that she could say the same thing about her coming home and worrying i‚Äôm going to ‚Äúshout‚Äù at her. now i have not shouted at her, lets get that very clear (to my knowledge at least). i have not raised my voice unless i cannot get a word in, and i would not then even class it as shouting. i will put a stern word across because the house is a mess, and that she needs to have a less pessimistic view on life with her own mental health as it‚Äôs not helping etc etc but that‚Äôs another story - LSS she comes to ask me for help, i tell her things that helped me in my rough patches of mental health, she then says that she can‚Äôt do that at all and she‚Äôs not willing to try, back to square one. 

anyway, i said i haven‚Äôt shouted at her, and then she reminded me i ‚Äúshouted‚Äù (i personally don‚Äôt think i did, i would have said i raised my voice beyond normal talking levels) the other day which i sort of agreed with. she then made the coffee, put it next to the sink where dirty dishes get left and walked away. 

i asked her ‚Äúdo you want this coffee?‚Äù to be met with ‚Äúi just f***ing made it, yes i do want it?‚Äù. while this may seem stupid, i asked her this because she has a habit of making drinks, putting them down and just forgetting about them, and i know this because we‚Äôve lived together for 3 years. so i said ‚Äúi was just asking because i didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôd gone to roll a cigarette, i thought you‚Äôd walked off upstairs to get changed or whatever‚Äù, she then rolled her eyes, told me to throw the coffee away and has ignored me since then.

‚ÄúTell me about yourself?‚Äù Someone asks, and i froze. I dont know if i have ever known who i am, i am simply a collection of every interaction i have had in life.

I have 2 kids 2.8yr old girl and a 5 month old 
My husband is the best guy i can say. He would be more worldly than islamic but he follows basics of Islam as his core principles. He prays 5 times. Soemtimes prays fjr late. He doesn't talk to girls he doesn't watch porn he protects he provides he does all that he is supposed to do. But what he doesn't or maybe 'can't do' is he doesn't emotionally care for me. If I express my feelings of being burnout or getting angry or frustrated with anything that the kids might have done, he just 'hmms' and gets on his with his phone or whatevr. He doesn't emotionally fill my cup. He works and I don't. So he gets to meet people at work. He gets plenty of time free where he can feel rejuvenated whereas I, I don't get that. I'm alone with the kids and I'm not a kids kinda person either so I get too overstimulated. If I am sick he will just listen with divided attention and give no reaction no affection he won't even ask me how I am doing or would just ask are you okay and I would say kinda and he would just take it as the end of convo and leave it. He can't even initiate a meaningful convo or properly do anything to make me feel better either physically or emotionally... 
Last night when I expressdd how sad I was and how my hormones are making me go crazy he goes on to say 'look at people below you and be grateful. And I feel like we keep talking about the same thing like we have nothing to ever speak."" this broke me completely.. I barely share my feelings with him and when I do this is what he says. He said that as if he has been attending to my needs. As he has done is just sit there and experience me getting sadder and sadder each day. 
 I told him that "" thinking about people below me dosnt make me feel any better or doesn't solve my issue."" 
 I am mentally depressed and I am resenting really bad things in my mind and my husband doesn't get it. He doesn't blv in being depressed. He doesn't understand PPD. He just neglects my emotional needs way more than I can handle to the point that I've started saying in my mind that I hate him and I hate his guts to ignore me and my tears and my struggles
He wants to only be involved if everything is roses and sunshine but the minute s*** hits the fan he pretends he doesn't see it or cares to offer support
Somedays he will come and say be happy it's okay take it easy. But these words are not comforting to me. He just doesn't get me or doesn't know how to make me feel better. I've made him understand what kinda words I like to hear and what I expect from him. to that he says that he is not that lovey dovey type guy who would do awwww awwww to my tears or my vent outs. He even chooses me over his friends. If he has a plan with hsi friends and I have a meltdown he would blatantly just say he needs to go leaves me in tears. How am I supposed to recover from such traumas?? Imagine your husband who you love so much ignoring your tears for his friends. 

I have been resenting him and the way he lives his life. He keeps getting breaks, goes on trips while he dumps me to my mom's place with the kids to hve fun weekly with his friends. If we go to the playground with our daughter he can't wait to leave. He gets too tired or feels too hot. But with his friends he will play sports even if its a 100 degrees outside. 

My friends moved to another countries after they married and I don't have people who I trust to hang out with. And most mother friends are always busy and hsve excuses to not meet. He is the only one I want to be around. Mind you we don't do anything fun like a hobby to do together. We might go get a takeaway or sit in the car while he gets his work done or pick up some grocery or coffee. And we are home. We don't engage we don't build our relationship and I've kept on vocalizing these issues since day one. But no. I'm the crazy one. And here we are year 4, and it's starting to kill my mental peace where I'm starting to think that he doesn't deserve me and that I used to be a better person and a better Muslim before I married him. Now I'm this bitter resenting woman who just hates her life and hate being a mom. I just hate everything now when these were the things I wanted to do and Liked doing. Now I just hate my life I hate myself I hate my husband and I hate how I am with my kids. I hate intimacy. How does he expect to have intimacy when he doesn't even emotionally satisfy me? He dosnt even physically satisfy me. He wants physical I want emotional. But he keeps getting his physical and I get none of my emotional or physical. I'm drained and dead I keep crying now. At night he knows I'm crying but he just touches my hand and snores asleep. He doesn't know what will make me feel better. He seems like he has given up on me. I know this is a recipe for disaster. And shaitaan is playing with mind games. I'm just fed up of living like this I want to be better and I want to be happy again for my self my kids. Please guide and please help.

I have seen my doctor, we did bloodwork, got me on iron supplements, did a sleep apnea test (nothing was found and I have never felt that was the issue). Here are the things I do to try to aid in my sleep:

* No alcohol/no smoking/no drugs
* Go to sleep at 9PM every night (sometimes 9:30 on weekends)
* Wake between 5-6AM every day
* One cup of coffee in the morning, no other caffeine
* Limit my water intake in the evenings to ensure I don't wake up to use the bathroom (keep well hydrated through the day)
* Use a sun lamp in the morning since it is still dark out a lot of the year when I start work
* Stay off my phone/tv for roughly one hour before bed and read
* Take iron/vitamin c/vitamin d/B12/magnesium bisglycinate in the evening (B12 & Vitamin D in the AM)
* Walk daily, even if just for 15 mins & strength train 4-5 times a week
* Diet isn't perfect, but I eat pretty well, and definitely through the week
* Listen to sleep stories to fall asleep as it helps calm my mind and not focus on anything else

I have tried melatonin, a small dose, and while it does make me very tired, I still do not sleep through the night and find I feel groggy the next day (like 1mg of it). I can usually fall asleep ok, because I am so exhausted, but I seem to toss & turn all night. I have a feeling it could be restless legs, my bloodwork has all come back as excellent, so I'm just sort of at a loss as to what to do. My doctor doesn't seem to have any ideas other than medications, and to be honest, I don't want to go down that road at all. 

Anyone else struggle to sleep through the night despite feeling they are doing everything right? I've looked into L-Theanine, Ashwaganda, etc. but I see a lot of mixed reviews, so I'm not confident in it. Ugh. ",1,1738941444.0,sleep,2,1.0,False

My coffee setup is sacred, and I wasn‚Äôt sure if this would fit in, but surprisingly, it‚Äôs earned its place right next to my cherished grinder. The coffee maker balances simplicity with functionality, but like anything, it‚Äôs not without its quirks.

**Design & Build Quality**

The Zutto EC-DAC50‚Äôs minimalist design caught my eye right out of the box. It‚Äôs compact, with an 8"" x 5"" x 10"" footprint, which is perfect for apartments or smaller kitchens. I appreciated the silver metallic finish‚Äîit gives it a clean, modern look that blends well with my kitchen d√©cor. The glass carafe feels a bit delicate, though, so I‚Äôve been treating it like it‚Äôs made of fine china. While lightweight materials make it portable, the plastic parts, especially the lid, feel slightly flimsy. If you‚Äôre prone to accidental drops, this might be a concern.

[Check Zojirushi EC-DAC50 Zutto's price on Amazon here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/zojirushi-ec-dac50-coffee-maker-review-b000eplk6o/)

**Brewing Performance**

This coffee maker excels at brewing coffee slowly, ensuring the water is heated between 195‚Äì200¬∞F before it drips over the grounds. It‚Äôs perfect if, like me, you want your coffee strong and flavorful. The brewing process takes a little longer than some machines, but the wait is worth it. The 5-cup claim translates to about two average-sized American mugs‚Äîideal for solo coffee drinkers or couples. However, if you‚Äôre hosting guests, you might find its capacity lacking.

**Coffee Flavor**

I‚Äôve brewed several types of coffee with the Zutto, from bold dark roasts to mild breakfast blends. The taste is consistently smooth and rich. Thanks to the charcoal water filter, even the tap water I use doesn‚Äôt interfere with the coffee‚Äôs flavor. My partner, who drinks his coffee black, noticed the difference right away. However, I did notice that the coffee cools relatively quickly unless poured into a thermal carafe.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**

One of the standout features of the Zutto is just how easy it is to clean. The water reservoir is removable, which means no awkward angles when filling or cleaning. The cone-shaped coffee basket and carafe are also easy to rinse. That said, the charcoal water filter needs replacing every few months, which adds a bit of ongoing cost. I also noticed a bit of calcium buildup after prolonged use, but a quick descaling session sorted it out.

**Pros**

* Compact design fits easily into small spaces.
* Slow brewing process results in rich, flavorful coffee.
* Removable water reservoir simplifies cleaning.
* Minimalist, attractive appearance.
* Keeps coffee warm for a short period without burning it.

**Cons**

* Fragile carafe and lightweight plastic parts.
* No automatic shutoff feature.
* Charcoal filter replacements can become an added expense.
* Limited capacity‚Äîbetter suited for 1‚Äì2 people.
* Requires manually turning off after use.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to larger machines like the Cuisinart DCC-3200P1, the Zutto EC-DAC50 wins in ease of cleaning and compactness. However, the Cuisinart offers a higher capacity and programmable features, which the Zutto lacks. If you‚Äôre looking at the Technivorm Moccamaster, the Zutto is far more affordable but doesn‚Äôt quite match its build quality or consistency for brewing larger quantities. On the other hand, the Zutto outperforms budget coffee makers like Mr. Coffee‚Äôs basic models in terms of taste and design.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

The Zutto sits at a mid-range price point, and for its features, it‚Äôs a fair deal. While it lacks bells and whistles like programmable timers or an auto-shutoff, its simplicity and performance make it worth considering for anyone who values flavor over frills. If you‚Äôre a casual coffee drinker or live in a small space, this is a good investment. Frequent coffee drinkers with larger households might need something with higher capacity, though.

**Features in Depth**

The Zutto includes a cone-shaped coffee basket, which ensures even water distribution for a balanced brew. Its removable reservoir simplifies the process of filling and cleaning, and I genuinely appreciate this feature more each day. The coffee maker has one button‚Äîon/off‚Äîwhich keeps things straightforward but might feel a bit too basic for some. The keep-warm plate works well for up to 15 minutes, but beyond that, the coffee turns bitter. I‚Äôve found myself pouring the coffee into a thermal mug right after brewing to avoid this.

The charcoal filter is an interesting addition. It helps purify the water used for brewing, which is noticeable in the coffee‚Äôs taste. However, the recurring need to replace the filter every few months adds to the overall cost of ownership.

**Final Verdict**

The Zojirushi EC-DAC50 Zutto Coffeemaker has become a reliable part of my coffee routine. It‚Äôs not perfect‚Äîthere are some design and functionality elements that could use improvement‚Äîbut the quality of coffee it produces outweighs its minor flaws. If you‚Äôre someone who values simplicity and exceptional coffee flavor, this little machine is worth considering.

I was able to reach the goal of finishing 10 books from just January - February. There's still a lot of books I haven't started reading, but I love collecting them and will 100% be finishing these.

For the grinder im pretty much Set on the Mazzer Philos. Looked at the timemore sculptor as well but feel like the Mazzer is a better fit for my preference.

For the machine however im very confused and feel like i dont really have a choice in what i could buy. Originally i planned to spent at most 2500‚Ç¨ but feel like i have to stretch to not buy something i will regret later. I mostly drink milk drinks right now but plan to drink more espresso once my grinder game is upgraded. To me its very important to have great steam performance because of it. Also i want a dual boiler with faster heat up time. I dont need super quick, anything below 15min is fine, but waiting 25 min for a mara v2 is no option. 

I guess i musst be in the minority but i hate the look of classic E61 machines. Also i would like my machine to have some sense of design and style because it will be placed on a seperate coffee table in the living room. 

With my plans i really cant think of any other machine besides a La Marzocco Linea Mini. Just for reference for a few other machines i looked at:

Ascaso Steel Duo: Steam was weak and the Vibration pump is quite annoying for the price.

Profitec Move: Steam performance was pretty meh as well and i just hate how this thing looks, especially in black.

Elektra Verve: very good machine with hideous wood panels, im more of a modern type of guy and this is too ugly to get my head around it and too close to a Micra in price for what it is

ACS Minima: found very little about it, looks great but service options are super limited and its a machine i would like to look at before buying which i cant.

Nurri R-Type: Basically perfect in the soon releasing dual boiler configuration with rotary pump. Unfortunately only one cery irresponsive dealer in my country and with that too much risk and most likely waiting time involved.

So am i just out of luck with my personal preferences and requirements or am i missing something?",1,1738940918.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ijwtny,https://www.reddit.com/r/gayrelationships/comments/1ijwtny/should_i_give_him_another_chance_or_move_on/,Should I Give Him Another Chance or Move On?,"TL;DR: Met a guy (34M) on Grindr, started as a hookup but turned into something deeper. I (31M) fell for him, but he said he wasn‚Äôt ready for anything serious. Later, he told me we weren‚Äôt intellectually compatible. I realized he just didn‚Äôt want me. He ghosted me completely‚Äîno closure.

Eight months later, he randomly messaged me: ‚ÄúAre you still in town?‚Äù (for sex). I ignored him.

Now, two months later, he found me on Hinge, claiming he‚Äôs looking for a serious, monogamous relationship and wants to properly date me again. I still have feelings for him but don‚Äôt know if I can trust him.

Should I give him another chance or move on?

The long story:

Hello dear gay fellows, I need some advice from those with more experience in relationships.

I (M, 31) come from a conservative society in my home country and moved to Europe three years ago. Once I got here, I embraced the freedom and the gay scene, started dating, and eventually found myself on Grindr.

My first hookup was with a no-photo profile, who turned out to be a 34-year-old gay man. We had amazing chemistry, incredible sex, and started meeting 2-3 times a week. What began as purely physical quickly evolved into something more‚Äîwe started going out for dinner, watching movies, going on hikes, and just spending time together. Two months in, I realized I had fallen for him, so I decided to have the ‚ÄúWhere is this going?‚Äù talk.

By that point, we were already exclusive, even though we never formally discussed it. When I asked, he told me that since he had just gotten out of a 7-year relationship, he wasn‚Äôt looking for anything serious. That was heartbreaking because it was clear that my feelings weren‚Äôt fully reciprocated.

Still, I kept seeing him, hoping things would change. We continued spending time together beyond just sex, and he seemed to enjoy it too. So, I tried again. This time, I openly told him I wanted a long-term relationship‚Äîwith him‚Äîwithout explicitly saying ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù He again said it was too early for him, that he needed 3-6 months to figure out his feelings, and that he wanted to keep seeing each other.

Not long after that, we had our first big fight. Looking back, I realize I wanted something from him that he simply didn‚Äôt want, and this was slowly breaking me. The tension between us grew‚Äîwhenever we talked about deeper topics like life and politics, there was an underlying discomfort. (The sex was still amazing though) Then, at around four months in, we were having dinner, and somehow the conversation took a turn. He outright told me that we were not intellectually compatible and that he was superior to me.

That was devastating. We weren‚Äôt in a competition, and we came from completely different backgrounds. Of course, there would be differences, but him putting it that way‚Äîso directly and offensively‚Äîwas deeply disappointing for me. In that moment, I realized why he never wanted a relationship. It wasn‚Äôt that he didn‚Äôt want one at all‚Äîhe just didn‚Äôt want one with me.

So, I decided to cut ties and move on. But deep inside, I hoped he would reach out, apologize, and we could at least have a conversation about it. Instead, he completely disappeared. In one day. Totally gone without a word. The man who used to call me daily, message me multiple times a day, and plan dates for us just vanished. No proper goodbye. No closure. After four months of seeing each other, did I really not even deserve that?

It took me a while to get over him. I was so happy with him that I had deleted all my dating apps, thinking I wouldn‚Äôt need them anymore. But after the breakup, I waited for a message from him every single day. Nothing. Eventually, one month later, I reinstalled the apps‚Äîand the very next day, I got a message from him on Grindr.

His message? ‚ÄúI dont know what happened to you that night? Hope life is going great. Meanwhile I had an amazing time with ‚Ä¶. (Tells an irrelevant story about himself‚Äù

I mean‚Ä¶ WTF? He had my number. He knew where I lived. But he reached out on Grindr instead? That felt so impersonal and weird. But I took it as an opportunity for closure. I sent him a message thanking him for everything, saying that we were in different stages of life and that fortunately we had survived this weird relationship. His response? He read the message and immediately blocked me.

Fast forward eight months later‚ÄîI had fully moved on. Deleted his photos, number, messages. Blocked him everywhere. Mentally and emotionally cleansed myself from him. I was enjoying my single life, and slowly getting ready for dating again.

Then, out of nowhere, he sent me a message:

‚ÄúAre you still in [our city]?‚Äù

No ‚ÄúHow have you been?‚Äù No ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs life?‚Äù Just that. I asked ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù and his response was:

‚ÄúJust for sex.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt even bother replying. I just thought to myself, Wow. What an asshole.

And now‚Äîtwo months later‚ÄîI decided to try Hinge to get back into dating. A few hours after I installed it, guess who liked my profile? Yep, him. His message?

‚ÄúI have sent you messages, but  they didn‚Äôt go through, i think you blocked me everywhere. But I hope you‚Äôre doing great, wanna have a walk or coffee?‚Äù

Curious, I checked his profile. He‚Äôs now looking for a serious, long-term, monogamous relationship. He filled out all the prompts about commitment and finding ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù

I was confused but curious, so I replied. After a few messages, he told me that after we stopped talking, he went through a rough time, hoped to get back together with his ex of 7-years,  but now realized it wasn‚Äôt happening‚Äîso he was back on the search for something serious.

I asked him directly: ‚ÄúWhat do you want from me?‚Äù Because two months ago, he reached out only for sex, and now he‚Äôs sending me a message on Hinge for something serious? His answer:

‚ÄúI want to have a proper date with you because I enjoyed our time together.‚Äù

So, dear fellows‚Ä¶ what should I do?

Part of me still has feelings for him. I enjoyed his company, and I want to see him again. But can I trust him? Or will he just disappear on me again when things don‚Äôt go his way? It took me months to get over him, when I finally removed him from my system, he wants to date me.

In the UK at least the price has gone up, and also I ordered some and then returned them when I didn't get what I ordered, so bought a pack of 40 unbleached Melitta papers from my supermarket as a stop-gap.  Have to say I don't notice any significant difference in either taste or drawdown times with the Melitta papers, I was worried there might be a noticeable paper taste but not so far.

Cat was third or fourth in the lineup and tbh the audience had been lukewarm, but the second Cat‚Äôs set began she had everyone wrapped around her finger. She crushed it. As a longtime member of the 30 it was a highlight of the trip. I was walking to get coffee this morning still laughlaughlaughing on the street like a fool. 

I was also lucky enough to see Come for Me at Joe‚Äôs pub a year and a half ago, and on my 30th birthday no less. Heaven!! (I feel comfortable sharing I am 31 plus and old for my grade)

Same goes for Pat. In 2022 I saw him perform a set at Bell House and he also brought the proverbial house down. It was really an honor to witness his mind at work in-person. His book is going to be so good. I was also at Pat‚Äôs show at the comedy venue in Medford MA that is a deli during the day, which Pat mentioned a couple times on the pod.

So if you are a troot sloot and have a chance to see Cat or Pat commit a third degree slay on stage, please don‚Äôt miss it. If you‚Äôre like me you‚Äôll still be raving about it years later üòª

I was immediately put on steroids and hydroxychloroquine. I started realizing something was off when my doctors kept pushing stronger medications on me and were not supportive of my intention to heal myself naturally. Over the years, even when I had positive results, they were very negative. My lupus progressed to kidney involvement (mild when I caught it) and so I decided to get serious and take matters into my own hands with no fear and no excuses.

I have had MASSIVE improvements in the last 6 months and I want to share exactly what I‚Äôm doing in the hopes that this will help others. Note that my lupus symptoms were severe (lost 30 lbs, hair loss, discoid lupus, extreme fatigue, extreme pain, joints so swollen I could not walk or drive properly, ulcers in mouth and more).
I feel like a different person now. I‚Äôm still healing, and am looking to add in the following: Columbra Vitamin D protocol under supervision, replacing my breakfast with a super nutrient dense, low oxolate low formal greens drink (veggies don‚Äôt agree with me but I need the chlorophyll and butrients), adding in exercise and moving somewhere less stressful <3 

WHAT WORKED
1. Cleaning my gut. Gerson protocol coffee enemas once per week for about 3 months at home. Followed by lots of hydrogen water (my boo bought me a $20 water bottle). Probiotics and gut reset pills from silver fern brand every day for 3 months to help. Nightly 1/4 cup aloe Vera juice in water with lemon and stevia 
CUT ALL SUGAR. Please please please listen to this. Your body is already struggling. I limit my sugar intake to one plantain a day now and a handful of berries and it‚Äôs still too much sometimes. This is the hardest part. Better Now Stevia will become your best friends

2.  Diet. WHALS PROTOCOL by Dr terry Whals. Listen. I‚Äôve tried them all. Raw vegan, vegan, pescatarian. They don‚Äôt work. You need animal protein and healthy fat, and you‚Äôre probably allergic to a lot of the pesticides you‚Äôre eating. I  have been on the whals protocol paleo elimination ( no gluten, dairy eggs grains nuts or seeds, lots of meat, some fermented foods, butter and now I‚Äôm doing a super dense greens drink once a day, veggie lectins cause me problems)

3. Manage your stress. Quit the job, stop talking to the bad friend, minimize contact with the negative family member. Just do it. If you‚Äôre ill you pay the price. Check your thought patterns. If you‚Äôre bitter, angry, complaining and blaming the world for your own unhappiness subconsciously or otherwise you‚Äôre hurting yourself. Take responsibility for your life with love 

4. DONT CUT OFF YOUR MEDS 
I‚Äôm on the same amount of meds I was on in the beginning, but have been titrating down my steroids. I‚Äôm on about 25% of what I was in year one. Get regular labs. Put your labs into chat gpt and ask for a comparative analysis each time you go in. You just do this yourself as well as listen to your doc if you want to actually understand what‚Äôs happening. Most docs can‚Äôt understand everything in detail and some will minimize positive results and recommend meds. If you can afford to see a functional med doc that you trust once every 3 months and check labs or even a good Rheumatologist I would recommend! Cutting off meds causes relapse 

5. Supplements! Daily: coq10, emp power plus, vitamin d 

6. Sleep: this one is amazing. Drink saffron and hibiscus tea (order both organic on Amazon, you only need 5 threads of saffron per cup one order will last you forever) it will knock you the f out in the best way üòÇüôè

Trust your intuition. This is a journey, you deserve to be well. Life is a gift. Autoimmune conditions are spiritual mental and physical. Don‚Äôt lose hope, and no, drugs alone are not the answer.

1ijwlva,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ijwlva/constant_worry_about_my_boyfriend_m28_and_i_f28/,Constant worry about my boyfriend M28 and I F28 financial gap,"TL;DR: I (28F) love my boyfriend (28M)‚Äîhe's kind, patient, and we have amazing chemistry‚Äîbut our financial differences are becoming more apparent. I make over double his income, and while I don‚Äôt need luxury, I do value quality and spontaneity. He‚Äôs frugal, doesn‚Äôt prioritize spending on experiences or small gestures, and I often take the lead in planning and financing things. I fear this isn't just about income but a fundamental difference in lifestyle and values. I don‚Äôt want to carry the financial and emotional weight of the relationship alone, but I also don‚Äôt want to walk away from someone so wonderful.  Is it possible to bridge this gap, or is it an incompatibility? Looking for real advice.

\-----

Please be hear me out/be gentle before judging or oversimplifying my situation into ‚Äújust end things.""

My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and he‚Äôs genuinely the most kind-hearted man I've ever met/dated. When we first started dating, I felt like he allowed me to lean on him emotionally and open up like i never have with someone. I love his calmness and patience and how trustworthy he has always been. Ive never doubted his intentions or authenticity. We laugh so much together and our chemistry is top tear.

*However*¬†over time, the differences in our financial situations have started to become more obvious. I grew up in upper-middle class while he grew up more middle-lower. Although I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a ‚Äúmaterialistic"" person, I‚Äôd consider my upbringing very fortunate and I have certain preferences to what I consider nice.

I also have my masters degree and have worked very hard to set up a nice living for myself and at this point I make over double his salary. This was never an issue to me because I knew he is working to find a new job and make more for himself \[and I at least want to give him the opportunity to do so\] but I‚Äôm realizing that the financial gap between us isn‚Äôt just about income but also about spending habits and lifestyle expectations.¬†

I don‚Äôt expect luxury all the time, and I am not looking for a partner to ""spoil me‚Äù but I value a level of quality and spontaneity that he doesn‚Äôt seem to prioritize, even for small things like flowers or coffee. Even if he gets a better-paying job, I fear his frugality won‚Äôt change. I‚Äôm starting to wonder if his approach to money and spending is just who he is rather than a temporary limitation.

Here are some of the things I‚Äôm struggling with:

* I‚Äôm often the one taking the initiative‚Äîplanning date nights, vacations, and making sure my relationship stays exciting. When he does plan, his choices feel like a downgrade, which makes it hard to let go of control.
* I‚Äôm a homebody by nature but I don‚Äôt want to spend all my weekends in, watching tv, because he doesn‚Äôt want to do anything that involves spending money. Right now, I cover a lot in terms of our environment‚Äîwhether it's the apartment itself, household items, or just making sure things feel nice and comfortable since were at mine 99% of the time. He doesn‚Äôt even get the basic necessities or groceries for his which concerns me for when we live together.¬†
* I‚Äôve started to feel like I‚Äôm making myself smaller to accommodate his financial situation - for example I would love to go out for a meal¬†*just because*¬†instead of having to schedule it as a date night weeks down the road.¬†
* I want to have some level of security for a future house, family, etc. and I may be the only one who is/has any savings for that but I'm not willing to be the sole contributor and don't think that's realistic for the expectations I have for my future-self.

I‚Äôve invested more in this relationship than any before, which makes this so painful. I still believe he's the best man I know and I don‚Äôt want to end things, but I‚Äôm also scared of ignoring the problem and getting hurt later. I don't want to be the one carrying the romantic and financial weight of this relationship all the time.

I've communicated some of my fears and concerns with him but I don't know if I'm saying too much or too little - I'd never want to make him feel inadequate or insecure when he is trying his best.

Is this something to adjust expectations / mentality /communication on or is there an amount of time to give to see if the circumstances change?

I came on a volunteer trip to a foreign country with extremely limited/poor healthcare. They wouldn‚Äôt allow my restoralax in as it looked like a powder similar to something else, so I got ducolax. I took 2 pills on Wednesday evening, I immediately got diarrhea like horribly. Then last night I had the most severe pains of my life, I was on the floor basically tremoring and shaking, it felt like I was in labour, I lost consciousness in the bath and my boyfriend had to stop me from hitting my head.

1ijwjun,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ijwjun,Not a bad anti supermarket haul,"So this month I am avoiding the supermarket as best I can and supporting my local stores which I don't do as often as I'd like! 

I live in a shopping district in a small cheese making town in the Netherlands and everything is in walking distance. I am an expat and I feel it's important to support the local economy.

I got coffee from the nut roaster (‚Ç¨12.50) and cheese from our amazing cheesemonger (‚Ç¨10.95). There are also wonderful bakeries for bread and pastries, a butcher, a fishmonger, a windmill to buy flour, a Polish shop, a Turkish supermarket and a fruit and veg shop which is always well stocked. There is also a market in the square on Wednesdays and Saturdays. I also picked up a Dubai chocolate from our chocolate maker from around the corner for a weekend treat.

The biggest surprise was a shop my friend recommended when I asked her where to get milk. It's self automated so I downloaded an app to open the door and pay for what I took. I got the milk (local from the dairy in town), some mandarins cos they looked good (they were!) and some stuff for pizza, not local but organic and from ltaly (‚Ç¨9.33).

It is working out to be pricier but I find I'm buying way fewer impulse purchases and it all tastes so much better. I also get to walk more which is a pain in the butt but also a good thing. And I get to support local.

1ijwiyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parosmia/comments/1ijwiyo/i_am_struggling/,I am struggling.,"I got a concussion back in Oct 24. Immediately and completely lost my sense of smell. My smells and taste came back within about two weeks. Then around the beginning of December things started smelling off. Specifically, my wife's coffee smelled like roadkill on a sizzling summer day. Around this same time, my petri dish of kids brought a cold into the house. I got a severe sinus infection. By Christmas, the typical parosmia triggers had completely overwhelmed me and I was barely eating. 

Christmas day my mother in law was making a prime rib and it was so nauseating. I stepped outside and started vomiting. To this point I hadn't been to the doctor. But now I was barely eating and vomiting. Went to the ER and they performed a CT scan on my sinus and my brain. Brain results came back fine but sinuses came back as 75% opacified in the left maxillary. Doc and I both assumed this was the cause of the smells. 

Now February, 4 sets of antibiotics later, and just completed another CT scan yesterday. That scan showed that the sinus cavity has very little within it anymore. So now I'm worried that this is from the nerves recovering from the concussion and have no idea how long it will take to heal. 

I feel like I'm withering away. I've lost over 40 pounds since December. Even the typical ""safe"" foods smell bad, plain pasta and rice.

I have no idea how some of you have survived for multiple years with this. 

Restaurants or anywhere that food is cooking completely debilitates and nearly immobilizes me. I've found that a n95 mask blocks most smells so I wear that at work whenever someone is heating up food. My wife has done so much to mitigate the smells. She set up an air fry, hot plate, convection oven, and what not out on the garage.

I'm just... Struggling. Mentally, physically, and emotionally. 

Is there any reprieve? I've seen some reports of some medicines working such as, phenytoin and Clonazepam. But I haven't seen any mention of it on this sub.

Hexes and curses, now that‚Äôs a topic bound to stir up emotions. Some people hear those words and immediately imagine dark, ominous figures cackling over cauldrons. Let‚Äôs put the Hollywood nonsense aside for a second because real magic isn‚Äôt a dramatic movie plot.

When discussing hexes and curses, justice comes up a lot. I always suggest learning more about the [Hermetic Principles](https://thealtpath.net/category/learning-witchcraft/how-does-witchcraft-work/hermetic-principles/), especially [cause and effect](https://thealtpath.net/cause-and-effect/). That‚Äôs usually the biggest concern for new practitioners‚Äîkarma. People often ask what counts as good or evil, which makes sense. This conversation happens constantly in our [metaphysical shop](https://thealtpath.net/metaphysical-store-near-me-ohio/), so come visit if you want to chat more.

Many have been conditioned to believe that hexes and curses, even jinxes, are inherently bad. That perspective is personal, shaped by experiences and beliefs. What one person calls evil, another calls necessary.

# Hexes, Curses, and Karma

People love throwing the word karma around, especially in the West, where it‚Äôs often reduced to a joke or a meme. I‚Äôll admit, some of those memes are pretty funny. But look deeper, and you‚Äôll see Eastern philosophy treats karma differently. It‚Äôs not cosmic revenge; it‚Äôs the natural consequence of character, choices, and behavior.

If you kick a sleeping dog and it bites you, you deserved that. I don‚Äôt buy into the idea of karma as instant payback, like the Threefold Law in Wicca. I‚Äôm not Wiccan, just a witch who follows logic. If you hurt a witch or someone they care about, and they retaliate magically, you created that outcome.

When it comes to hexes and curses, I believe in two things: cause and effect, and justice. Sometimes, witches *are* the karma.

# Casting Hexes and Curses for Justice

Some people refuse to retaliate, which is their choice. Binding spells provide a non-aggressive approach, but they often don‚Äôt last. Some call hexes and curses evil, but let‚Äôs be real‚Äîif someone came after your child, would you just meditate on positive energy? Or would you do something about it?

A lion doesn‚Äôt hesitate when protecting its cubs. Some say witches should avoid harming others, but life isn‚Äôt always that simple. Some witches live in peaceful, protected spaces, while others deal with harsher realities. I choose to be proactive in protecting myself and those I love. Prevention works better than damage control.

I don‚Äôt go around cursing for fun, but I also don‚Äôt sit idly by. My motto is simple: ‚ÄúDo no harm, but take no s\*\*t.‚Äù That‚Äôs why I prefer ‚Äúreturn to sender‚Äù spells, which work well for those concerned about karma. Keep an eye out for future articles on this type of magic.

While some witches may wish misfortune on others for petty reasons, I believe intention matters. The punishment should fit the crime, but it should also teach. Ideally, the offender learns a lesson rather than just suffers. The *why* behind a curse or hex matters far more than the *how*. If you‚Äôre throwing spells just to be dramatic, maybe rethink your choices. You don‚Äôt want that energy following you around.

Witches should spend most of their time on protection, healing, and helping others. I believe the universe leans toward love, but I also recognize nature‚Äôs brutal sense of balance.

# When Are Hexes and Curses Justified?

That‚Äôs a complicated question. I can‚Äôt tell you what to believe, only what I believe. I always encourage people to consider all perspectives before taking action. That applies to everyday life and magical practice.

Think about real-world justice. Should a rapist walk free? Is three years in prison enough for someone who destroyed lives? Should a murderer be released after ten years? What about a predator who avoids indictment due to lack of evidence? How many more victims will they create before the legal system finally catches up?

Law enforcement often says, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt do anything until they act.‚Äù That mindset ranges from ineffective to outright dangerous. As a witch, I ask‚Äîwhy wait? If you know someone has caused harm, but the law won‚Äôt step in, why let them continue?

If a friend is stuck in an abusive relationship but feels too broken to leave, should witches sit back and hope for the best? What if the law refuses to protect them?

At the end of the day, I teach my coven members to *think*. I don‚Äôt dictate what is good or evil. That‚Äôs for them to decide. I simply provide the knowledge to help them form their own moral compass.

# The Truth About Hexes, Curses, and Jinxes

A curse, hex, or jinx is essentially a spell packed with negative energy, fueled by anger, fear, or raw emotion. Unlike most magic, it doesn‚Äôt always require a conscious effort. Sometimes, sheer rage combined with a fleeting thought like ‚ÄúI hate them‚Äù is enough to send out harmful energy. That‚Äôs what makes these spells risky. They don‚Äôt need fancy rituals or magical expertise‚Äîjust enough emotion and intent.

Of course, a curse or hex cast by an experienced witch will be much more focused and effective. But never underestimate the power of raw, unfiltered resentment. The evil eye is a real thing, and sometimes all it takes is a look.

# Relax, You‚Äôre Probably Not Cursed

Before you spiral into panic, let‚Äôs be realistic. Most people will never be cursed, nor will they accidentally curse someone. It takes extreme anger and focus to unintentionally send out hexes or curses. Most people can‚Äôt hold onto that level of rage long enough to do real damage. While anyone *can* cast a curse, it‚Äôs still rare.

I get asked, ‚ÄúAm I cursed?‚Äù way more than you‚Äôd expect. This comes up often in [tarot readings](https://thealtpath.net/tarot-readings/). Most of the time, the answer is no. In reality, people often curse themselves with bad choices, weak boundaries, and an unwillingness to learn from past mistakes.

If you‚Äôre still curious, let‚Äôs break down the levels of magical misfortune.

# Jinx: Annoying, But Not Life-Altering

While hexes and curses carry serious weight, a jinx is more of a mild annoyance. It‚Äôs like tripping over nothing when you‚Äôre already having a bad day. It‚Äôs frustrating but not catastrophic. Jinxes follow patterns, usually triggering under specific conditions. Think of them as supernatural Murphy‚Äôs Law‚Äîwhen you need things to go right, they won‚Äôt.

Jinxes are tricky to identify because they‚Äôre so subtle. Your phone dies when you need it, your coffee spills on your clean shirt, or every red light stops you when you‚Äôre late. It‚Äôs irritating, but it won‚Äôt ruin your life.

# Hex: The Magical Wrecking Ball

Of hexes and curses, a hex is a one-time, targeted hit. Think of it like stepping on a rake‚Äîsudden, painful, and disorienting. It won‚Äôt destroy *everything*, just one specific area of your life.

For example, a hex could make you completely bomb an important presentation. It won‚Äôt ruin every speech you give forever‚Äîjust this one. Maybe your voice cracks, your mind goes blank, or you spill water on yourself in front of everyone. The hex makes sure this moment doesn‚Äôt go your way. You likely won‚Äôt even realize it‚Äôs a hex until after the damage is done.

# Curse: The Unrelenting Nightmare

A curse is what you *really* don‚Äôt want to deal with. It has the targeted hit of a hex but refuses to go away. Unlike a hex, a curse latches onto an area of your life and keeps wrecking it.

A curse might destroy every romantic relationship you enter or ensure every financial opportunity crumbles. It doesn‚Äôt just cause one bad event‚Äîit creates an ongoing cycle of misfortune. The worst part? Curses are hard to break and rarely disappear on their own.

If you‚Äôre cursed, you‚Äôll know. The signs won‚Äôt be subtle, and the bad luck won‚Äôt let up.

So if you suspect a curse, it might be time to reverse it. Or maybe just apologize to whoever you pissed off. Either way, good luck. You‚Äôll need it.

Sundays were always slow at the plant. She was covering the day shift of one of her coworkers who had left early the day before and called out today. At this time on a usual Sunday she would usually be laying on her comfy couch, watching videos on the internet, chain smoking cigarettes, and chain drinking cups of coffee. Today, however, she was sitting in an average office chair, watching security cameras, taking a smoke break every hour or so, still chain drinking cups of coffee but it was regular office coffee ‚Äì not the tasty stuff she had at home. Aside from the occasional truck, a couple patrols, and answering alarms set off by the strong winds, the Sunday shift was 10 hours of downtime, which is good for a security guard. Boring days were a good thing. When things were ‚Äúexciting‚Äù it‚Äôs usually something bad ‚Äì a chemical leak leading to a plant wide evacuation, an on-the-job injury, a hostile contractor not following the rules, a disgruntled former employee ‚Äì all exciting, all bad news.

‚ÄúIs it cold in here, or is it just me?‚Äù Her coworker said, getting up to check the thermostat.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not too bad‚Äù she said ‚Äúand I‚Äôm usually the one who‚Äôs always cold.‚Äù

‚Äú70 degrees! Yesterday it was like 65 in here and I was fine, why am I so cold today?‚Äù he said, putting on his coat.

‚ÄúHuh, that‚Äôs weird.‚Äù She said. ‚ÄúWe can bust out a heater if you want.‚Äù

‚ÄúNaw.‚Äù He said sinking into his chair.

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm heading out on my drive. Call me if you start dying.‚Äù She laughed.

‚ÄúYeah alright.‚Äù He said from behind the high collar of his coat.

While she drove she kept an eye out for anything out of the ordinary. She got out a couple of times to make sure doors were locked, but she mostly just meandered through the plant in the security truck. The AC in the truck felt nice ‚Äì it was starting to get hotter outside. She pulled into the parking spot an hour and a half later and walked into the post. It was warm ‚Äì when she checked the thermostat it said 78. He was sitting in front of the computer desk, the monitors showing the views of cameras placed around the plant. He was still bundled up in his coat.

‚ÄúYou doin‚Äô okay man?‚Äù

‚ÄúDude‚Ä¶I was keeping an eye on your patrol then things started going all spinny with shapes. What‚Äôre those things called?‚Äù he held up his hands to his face like he was looking though a telescope.

‚ÄúKaleidoscope.‚Äù She said.

‚ÄúYeah. Whenever I move my head it gets like that.‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúAnd my fingers are like ice cubes.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe just take it easy for a bit, I‚Äôll hold down the fort.‚Äù

As she began to but the report for her patrol into the post computer, she could hear the sound of steady breathing. She turned around and saw that he had nodded off.

If he wants to try and stick it out, I‚Äôll let him get a quick nap and see how he‚Äôs doin‚Äô she thought. It‚Äôs a slow Sunday anyway.

There only needed to be two guards on duty at a time so that the post wasn‚Äôt left unattended while one guard was out on patrol. It was a good place to work if you are the type of person who doesn‚Äôt like being around lots of people, the downside being that you are around that one person ten hours a day, four days a week ‚Äì it can be torture if you‚Äôre stuck with someone you don‚Äôt get along with. Luckily, they got along great, even played games outside of work sometimes.

She couldn‚Äôt hear the shallow breaths of sleep. She turned around ‚Äì still in his chair, bundled up in his coat.

‚ÄúHeeey, rise and shiiine. I know you‚Äôre not feeling good, but I can‚Äôt have you sleepin‚Äô on me too long.‚Äù she laughed.

No response. No breathing. She got up, walked across the room and shook his shoulder.

‚ÄúDude, c‚Äômon. When I said you could take it easy I didn‚Äôt mean‚Äì‚Äú

He slumped off the chair falling hard onto the floor of the post.

‚ÄúFUCK!‚Äù she leaned down and lightly slapped is face, ‚ÄúYou still with me! HEY!‚Äù he was non-responsive.

She checked for a pulse ‚Äì nothing. His skin was pale and freezing and his lips were starting to turn purple. She ran to the phone and put it on speaker as she called the emergency number. Because they were out in the middle of nowhere, the plant had full time Emergency Response Team staff members with an ambulance on site in case of emergencies.

‚ÄúEmergency Operations, what‚Äôs your emergency?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, this is the guard post! The other guard on duty fell out of his chair! He‚Äôs got no pulse, his skin‚Äôs cold, he‚Äôs not breathing!‚Äù

‚ÄúEmergency responders are heading your way. Do you know CPR?‚Äù

She was already kneeling over to her friend on the floor. ‚ÄúChest compressions, 2 inches deep, Staying Alive!‚Äù She shouted towards the phone.

‚ÄúJust keep that up until the emergency responders arrive and they‚Äôll take over.‚Äù

When she put her interlaced hands on his chest and started pushing down, something felt wrong. He was a heavier guy, but was he supposed to feel this squishy? His body was giving way under her hands and with each press she could swear she could see his head bulging. With the feeling of his body‚Äôs reaction to the chest compressions combined with his temperature, she couldn‚Äôt help but to imagine his organs suspended in strawberry milkshake.

‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs wrong!‚Äù she yelled at operator on the phone. ‚ÄúHe feels weird!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean? Weird how?‚Äù the emergency operator said.

‚ÄúLike a milkshake!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

There was a sickening pop followed by the sound of thick splashing. His head had ruptured spilling it‚Äôs contents onto the floor of the post. The bits of skull and brain matter had become frozen crystalline masses and had shattered into pieces. The blood that had sprayed out was melting on the warm floor. More blood that had only just started to crystalize, was slowly sloshing out from the flaps of pale skin and hair that were the only thing left of her friend‚Äôs head.

Not a milkshake‚Ä¶she thought. A slushy. She started screaming.

She sat down hard on the floor and pushed herself away from the popped body, stopping only when her back slammed against the cabinet. The tears that had been building up in her eyes from the panic and adrenaline started flowing down her face. She heard the person on the phone yelling something.

""HE'S DEAD! HE'S FUCKING DEAD! DUDE JUST POPPED...WHAT THE FUCK!"" she yelled at the phone.

""Help is on the way, you need to calm down and take a breath!""

She turned her head and threw up. Then she heard a squelching sound - and the sound of...windchimes?

She wiped the vomit from her mouth and the tears from her eyes and looked at him - something inside his body was moving. She started screaming again.

A large, bloody, opalecent beak wiggled it's way out of the hole in the floppy husk of her co-worker. The skin of his body streatched and cracked as a large bird was being born from the remains of her exploded friend. The further it emerged, the colder the room got with frost quickly forming on the windows and the moisture in the air becoming shimmering snowflakes. The sound coming from it was the squaking chirps of a new born bird combined with the clinking and shattering of ice. It's wings were flexible icicles that made the sound of wet glass as the creature slapped against the floor trying to get purchase. The blood sublimated off it's body revealing translucent feathers casting caustics throughout the room as the light caught them. Slender crane-like legs were capped with webbed human feet, barbed talons jutted from the tips of it's toes and hooked into the flesh of the neck and shoulders as it struggled to free itself from the icy corpse.

Plumes of fog billowed from her mouth as she screamed - she felt her skin tingle and then burn from the cold, her extremeties began to discolor, her lips chapped and split, the streaks of tears on her face froze before they could roll off her chin. Struggling to breathe in the ice cold air with her frostbitten lungs, she stopped screaming. The world around her became kaleidoscopic. The optical caustics from the phoenix's body dancing on every surface, the shifting prismic fractals of the snowflakes hanging silently in mid-air, the warm light rays of the sun mixing with the cool light of the flourecent tubes above her. All of these danced within the crystalizing jelly of her eyes. The beauty of it mezmerized her in that moment.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\

Then as we head in, the five of them were heading out, with Rinka in the front. I was fully mortified at being a weird fan so all I could muster was smiling politely, but it was a nice end cap to the trip and a really great show.

First, shoutout to all my kings out there. This one is for the men. A few easy tips because I see a lot of dudes struggling about profile reviews etc.. Take this advice, or not - i dont care.. but here are some surefire ways to improve your dating life OLD and IRL

* **Make yourself more f\*ckable.** Whatever your situation is, take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself if you are. Every man should at the minimum be under 20% body fat and in a decent weight range. I'm not saying you have to be a super model, but you need to look like you are active in any way. Hit they gym/be active 2 times a week AT THE VERY LEAST.
* **Let's take a look at your style.** Ok so you're a little over/underweight. Do your clothes compliment your body type? Do your your colors clash? Here's a simple tip - stick to earth tones. Black, White, Beige, Blue, Brown, Earthy Green. Any combination of those colors and you'll do fine. Make sure your shoes are clean and your clothes are not wrinkled.
* **Have an active hobby.**  I don't care if its just walking, ping pong, birdwatching.. it doesn't matter. Any hobby that gets you off your screen and into the sunshine or gives you a good sweat.
* **Talk to everyone.** Literally everyone. Women, men, old, young.. at the grocery store.. just have a friendly chat about anything relevant to increase that confidence in chatting and talking to people. This will help you in the dating world be more confident in yourself and just be yourself in a really good way.
* **Find dates offline.** I tell the guys I know that online dating should be 30% of your bag. The other 70% of your dating needs to be found offline. Coffee shops, malls, the grocery store, gym (which you need to frequent)
* **Get good photos.** No women will give two craps about your witty prompts... your funny intro messages... compliments etc. If you do not up your aesthetic game. Online dating is a surface level and if you do not have great photos - you've already lost.
* **Last, but most important: It's not that serious.** Dating should be a fun process, and any women/man who you chat with should be a fun experience. If it's not easy, it's not worth it. I've dated super hot attractive women that I want to stab myself in the eye because I thought it would be worth it... and it's just not. Have fun with it, and be a fun person.

Any additional tips drop below. GL out there soliders.

Edit: It's sad that ""Being attractive"" is the most upvoted comment here. Fellas, attraction is definitely important.. but **if you are not confident in yourself or you do not carry yourself with confidence, your attraction will not matter to a woman.**

Great tip from [Dazzling\_Ear\_5319](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dazzling_Ear_5319/) : **No sexual talk early on.** Keep it light and fun, but don't talk super sexual or explicit until you guys are comfortable with each other and been on a few dates etc.

Informal\_Sherbert251:  **Text less, be authentic, and save the longer conversations for in-person dates!** Try to text less and keep yourself busy. Let's show your personality in real life fellas.

So, I thought I'd tell you what I do to keep my blood pressure in check as a 45-year-old obese man.  

1. First of all, I take medication. In my mid-30s, I was put on hydrochlorothiazide (which had way too many side effects, the most being it caused gout from dehydration). I moved to 50mgs of losartan, which I've been on ever since. I take it at 8 a.m. 

2. I don't smoke, don't do any drugs, and I don't consume alcohol, except for the rare date or social convention where I have one or two drinks. I don't drink juice or coffee. Just ice water and herbal tea throughout the day. 

3. I exercise about 4-5x a week. Now, I'm a fan of the Peloton bike, which is now priced more reasonably than when I bought it in 2020. I specifically do Power Zone Training on the bike. They have challenges where you can earn badges and it's a great motivator. My cardiologist said Power Zone Training is the absolutely best exercise you can do for your heart. In addition to cycling, I do some strength training on the Peloton. Just light weights (no more than 15 pounds) but I try to incorporate it in. Please note, that I have no stock in Peloton. I just really like the bike. 

4. I eat virtually zero fast or fried foods. Ninety-five of the food I eat, I make at home. I do benefit from being able to work at home. That's not to say my diet is great - if it was - I wouldn't be obese. I still eat pizza, and tacos and hoagies, wings - however they are all made in my kitchen or smoker. The only ""fast food"" I indulge in is acai bowls. 

5. Mental health: I do weekly therapy (I have somatic symptom disorder and health anxiety), but I've found it hugely beneficial. I have a dog, which I think reduces my anxiety and depression and also requires me to take him for daily walks. And lastly, but still very important, I meditate. Sometimes during the day, but always in the evening to sleep. I do this through the Peloton app which has a variety of meditation classes. 

When I wake up, I check my bp and it is usually 120-128/78-84. Take my medicine. Check it around noon and it is 100-110/60-80 and once again at night where it is usually around 120/80. I overcheck it due to my health anxiety. It's something I'm working on. 

Hope this helps someone.

1ijw3x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/skincaredevices/comments/1ijw3x4/verilux_happylight_touch_plus_vt42ww3_detailed/,Verilux HappyLight Touch Plus VT42WW3 detailed review for boosting mood and focus,"Testing out the Verilux HappyLight Touch Plus VT42WW3 has been an interesting addition to my daily routine. As someone who spends long hours working indoors with minimal natural light, I was curious to see if this light therapy lamp could live up to its claims of improving mood, focus, and energy levels. Honestly, it‚Äôs been a mixed bag, with notable highs and a few lows.

**Design & Build Quality**

This lamp doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúmedical gadget,‚Äù which I appreciate. Its polished finish and compact dimensions (6.38 x 6.38 x 10.32 inches) make it blend seamlessly into my desk setup. The detachable stand adds versatility, letting me move and adjust it easily. However, the build isn‚Äôt flawless‚Äîwhile it feels sturdy enough for daily use, the stand occasionally detaches unexpectedly, which can be frustrating, especially if you‚Äôre clumsy like me. On one unfortunate morning, I knocked it over, and while it survived the fall, it rattled me more than it did the lamp.

**Ease of Use**

Verilux nailed the user-friendly aspect. The touch controls are intuitive, and the various brightness and color settings make it adaptable to different needs. I didn‚Äôt even need to glance at the manual to figure out how to adjust the brightness or set the timer. However, the corded design limits portability, unlike some competitor models that come with rechargeable batteries. If you‚Äôre like me and move between a desk and couch often, this could be a downside.

Wondering if Verilux HappyLight Touch Plus VT42WW3 fits your budget?[ Check Amazon.](https://agegene.com/product-reviews/verilux-happylight-touch-plus-review-b08kfqby43/)

**Performance & Effectiveness**

After using this daily for a month, I started noticing subtle changes in my mood and energy, especially during those dreary, overcast mornings. The 10,000 Lux brightness is impressive and does mimic natural sunlight effectively, though the two color temperature settings felt a bit redundant. I didn‚Äôt notice a huge difference between the warmer and cooler tones. Still, the light does what it‚Äôs supposed to‚Äîit provides a solid dose of brightness to kickstart your day.

**Comfort**

Sitting in front of the HappyLight is surprisingly pleasant. It‚Äôs bright but not overwhelming, and the light is UV-free, so there‚Äôs no worry about skin damage. I found the adjustable brightness ideal for sensitive eyes. My coworker, who joined me for a ‚Äúlight therapy session,‚Äù also noted how comfortable it felt even during extended use.

**Battery Life & Charging**

This is where the HappyLight falls short for me. It‚Äôs not battery-powered, so you‚Äôre always tied to an outlet. While the six-foot cord offers some flexibility, it‚Äôs not as convenient as having a rechargeable option for portability. If you‚Äôre someone who likes to use devices on the go, this could be a dealbreaker.

**Additional Features**

The timer function is a lifesaver for someone as forgetful as me. You can set it in 10-minute increments up to an hour, which is perfect for quick sessions while sipping your morning coffee. The customizable brightness and color temperature settings add an extra layer of personalization, though, as I mentioned earlier, the difference between the color tones isn‚Äôt as pronounced as I‚Äôd hoped.

**Safety & Skin Sensitivity**

This is where the Verilux HappyLight Touch Plus VT42WW3 shines (pun intended). The UV-free light is gentle on the skin and eyes. I‚Äôve had no irritation or discomfort, even with daily use, which can‚Äôt be said for all light therapy products. My partner, who has sensitive skin, also tested it out and gave it a thumbs-up.

**Pros**

* Compact and sleek design that fits well on any desk or bedside table.
* 10,000 Lux brightness is effective for mimicking natural sunlight.
* Intuitive touch controls and a useful timer feature.
* UV-free light ensures skin and eye safety.

**Cons**

* Corded design limits portability compared to battery-operated competitors.
* The detachable stand can be unstable and prone to detachment.
* The difference between color temperature settings isn‚Äôt significant.
* Lacks a rechargeable battery option, which might be a dealbreaker for some.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to other popular light therapy lamps like the Circadian Optics Lumos 2.0 or the Carex Day-Light Classic Plus, the Verilux HappyLight Touch Plus VT42WW3 holds its ground well. Its design is more modern and compact than the bulkier Carex models, which is a win for those with limited desk space. However, the Carex lamp offers a larger light panel, which might appeal to those seeking broader coverage. The Circadian Optics lamp, on the other hand, edges ahead in portability with its rechargeable battery. For me, the Verilux‚Äôs customizable settings and UV-free light tipped the scales in its favor.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

Is the Verilux HappyLight Touch Plus VT42WW3 worth the investment? I‚Äôd say yes, but with some reservations. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest option out there, its effectiveness and build quality justify the price tag. However, if portability is high on your priority list, you might want to explore other options. For those willing to compromise on mobility for performance, this lamp is a solid choice.

It‚Äôs not what I thought I‚Äôd be angry with him about. Our little girl is 7 weeks and she‚Äôs a peanut. Sleeps hard to get like I think everyone here knows.

At 5 I can finally do things like take a shower and clean if I was unable to during the day. I keep our house spotless, with a 7 week old. Idk how I do it sometimes because I‚Äôm so exhausted. 

Two nights ago I left our kitchen sparkling clean and woke up to the sink piled with dishes and stuff all over the counter. MIL and my husband didn‚Äôt clean up after themselves when they had dinner.

Last night he comes in at 8pm when I‚Äôm trying to go to bed, he puts our daughter in the bassinet and then passes out in bed; she starts fussing not even 5 minutes after being put down. This was not the deal, I was suppose to get until midnight. But I didn‚Äôt complain I took it on the chin and barely slept last night. 

Woke my husband up at 6am after nursing so I could get uninterrupted sleep before he has to work. He slept 10 hours and he immediately complains about being tired.

I've been calling it ""um grande"" whenever I see the barista reach for an espresso cup, and then try to explain in my broken Portuguese that I would like a ""caf√© como um cheio mas um pouco mais grande, com muita agua por favor!"" This is understood of course, but I was wondering if there's a standard word for it.

EDIT: Solved. The word is ""abatanado"", as answered by u/raginmundus and u/kormavibes.",7,1738937891.0,Portuguese,13,0.82,False
1ijvz67,https://i.redd.it/sgkiixjz6qhe1.png,"May 6, 1937, LZ 129 Hindenburg (Luftschiff Zeppelin #129) Airship Menu. (please read facts about this menu and the airship in our comment)","The Hindenburg disaster on May 6, 1937, was a terrible tragedy that shocked the world. This menu is a reproduction of the kind served on the real airship, giving us a glimpse into the luxury dining experience passengers enjoyed before the disaster.


üçΩÔ∏è The Hindenburg‚Äôs Dining Experience


The LZ 129 Hindenburg was a German airship that flew in the 1930s. It was like a floating luxury hotel in the sky.


üçû First-Class Meals in the Air


The Hindenburg had a full kitchen and a chef who prepared fresh meals, just like on a fancy ocean liner.


üçµ Breakfast on May 6, 1937 had coffee, tea, cocoa, fresh bread, butter, honey, preserves, and eggs.


üå≠ It also included Frankfurt sausage, ham, salami, cheese, and fruit.


üçó Dinner was even fancier! Passengers ate beef broth with dumplings, Rhine salmon, and roast gosling.


üçê Dessert was Pears Cond√©, which is poached pears with chocolate sauce.


‚òï There was coffee and fresh fruit to finish the meal.


üö¢ Menu was inspired by Ocean Liners


üçΩÔ∏è The Hindenburg‚Äôs dining was modeled after fancy cruise ships. The tables had white tablecloths, silverware, and fresh flowers.


üßë‚Äçüç≥ There were real chefs cooking on board, just like on the Titanic.


ü•Ç Passengers could drink wine and champagne while looking out giant panoramic windows.



üî• The Final Meal Before Disaster


üõë The May 6, 1937 menu was likely the last meal ever served on the Hindenburg before it caught fire and crashed in Lakehurst, New Jersey.


üö® The airship burst into flames during landing, and the disaster was caught on film.


üò¢ 36 people lost their lives, but 62 survived by jumping out before the flames spread too fast.


üéà Interesting Fact: Airships Had No Refrigeration!


There were no refrigerators! All food had to be freshly cooked or stored in ice chests.


ü•© Meat and fish were packed with ice and used quickly before they spoiled.


üçû Bread, cheese, and preserved foods were common since they didn‚Äôt go bad as fast!




üõ´ The End of Zeppelin Travel


The Hindenburg disaster marked the end of passenger airships. After that, people only used airplanes for fast travel.


üõ©Ô∏è If not for the crash, we might still have luxury airship flights today.

I love coffee, so any great coffee spots would be much appreciated! Also, any recommendations for family-friendly places to eat and easy activities or scenic walks I can do with a baby? (No buggy, I will be carrying him)

1ijvykd,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTableCentral/comments/1ijvykd/lufeiya_lfylsbrown40_small_l_shaped_desk_review/,Lufeiya LFY-LS-Brown-40 small L shaped desk review with pros and cons,"I‚Äôve been using the Lufeiya LFY-LS-Brown-40 L-shaped desk for a few weeks now, and I have to admit‚Äîthis desk has been a pleasant surprise. It‚Äôs compact yet functional, and it definitely punches above its weight class in terms of features. As someone who works from home and juggles multiple gadgets, finding a small-sized desk that fits snugly into a corner without feeling cramped was a priority. This particular model caught my attention because of its rustic brown finish coupled with a built-in power outlet and USB ports. Those features made it a serious contender for my limited office space.

The desk came neatly packaged, which was a relief because I was dreading a repeat of my last DIY furniture experience (spoiler: it involved tears and a missing screw). Everything was intact, no scratches or missing components, and the instructions were clear enough for me to follow without needing a YouTube tutorial. Though it‚Äôs supposed to take only 20 minutes to assemble, I took my sweet time‚Äîmainly because my cat decided it was ‚Äúhelp time.‚Äù By the end, I was left with a sturdy piece of furniture that didn‚Äôt wobble, which, let‚Äôs be honest, is a win for budget-friendly desks.

[Check Lufeiya LFY-LS-Brown-40 price on Amazon here.](https://decorgurus.com/product-reviews/lufeiya-lfy-ls-brown-40-desk-review-b0bz7yd7qs/)

**Design & Build Quality**  
Right off the bat, the rustic brown color is a showstopper. It gives this desk a warm, inviting look that blends seamlessly with my home office aesthetic. The engineered wood top has an anti-scratch and waterproof finish, which has already proven its worth when I accidentally spilled coffee on it. The metal frame is powder-coated, and the desk feels robust enough to handle daily wear and tear. While I wouldn‚Äôt test it with heavy machinery, it supports my dual monitors, laptop, and a couple of books without any fuss.

**Size & Space**  
This desk is compact, with dimensions of 39.4‚ÄùD x 27.5‚ÄùW x 29.5‚ÄùH, making it ideal for smaller spaces like apartments, dorms, or cozy home offices. Despite its small footprint, the L-shape design maximizes work surface area. I was able to fit my laptop on one side and a notebook on the other without feeling cramped. If you‚Äôre someone who needs a bit more space to spread out, though, this might feel a tad restrictive.

**Functionality & Features**  
The built-in power strip is what truly sets this desk apart. With three outlets and two USB ports, I no longer have to crawl under the desk to plug in my devices, and that alone deserves a round of applause. Another neat feature is the reversible shelves, which I could set up on either side depending on the layout of my room. These shelves are perfect for holding my external hard drives, a small printer, and even a decorative plant to keep things lively.

That said, the storage bag that comes with the desk is a nice touch but feels a little flimsy. I wouldn‚Äôt trust it with anything too heavy. The adjustable feet are a lifesaver for uneven floors. My desk sits perfectly level, even though my apartment floors resemble a topographical map.

**Assembly**  
I‚Äôd rate the assembly process as beginner-friendly. The instructions are clear, and all the parts are labeled. That said, the absence of extra tools in the box might frustrate those without a basic toolbox. I managed to assemble it solo, but if you‚Äôre not used to furniture assembly, having an extra set of hands wouldn‚Äôt hurt.

**Pros**

1. Built-in power strip with USB ports is incredibly convenient.
2. Compact yet functional design fits into tight spaces.
3. Sturdy build quality with anti-scratch and waterproof finish.
4. Reversible shelves allow for flexible setup.
5. Adjustable feet ensure stability on uneven surfaces.

**Cons**

1. The storage bag feels a bit flimsy and could have been sturdier.
2. Limited surface area may not suit those needing more workspace.
3. Tools for assembly are not included, which could be inconvenient.
4. Some might find the desk height (29.5‚Äù) slightly low for taller chairs.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to other desks in this price range, the Lufeiya LFY-LS-Brown-40 stands out for its built-in power strip and USB ports. Many desks in a similar category, like the Cubiker L-Shaped Computer Desk or the Mr. Ironstone Gaming Desk, lack this feature. However, the Cubiker desk offers a larger workspace, which might be a better option for those with bigger setups. On the flip side, the Mr. Ironstone desk is more gaming-oriented, with a dedicated headphone hook and cup holder, which the Lufeiya lacks. If you‚Äôre looking for a balance of aesthetics and functionality for a small office or study, Lufeiya takes the cake.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
The price point feels justified, considering the features it packs. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest desk available, the inclusion of a power strip, reversible shelves, and adjustable feet gives it an edge over some competitors. For someone like me who prioritizes both functionality and style, it‚Äôs a worthwhile investment. That said, if your budget is tight and you don‚Äôt need the power strip or shelves, you could find simpler desks at a lower price.

The Lufeiya LFY-LS-Brown-40 desk has been a reliable addition to my home office, offering a blend of style, functionality, and compactness. While it has a few minor flaws, they‚Äôre not deal-breakers, especially for a desk in this price range. It‚Äôs perfect for small spaces and those who appreciate thoughtful design.

1ijvy54,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ijvy54/hamilton_beach_flexbrew_49920_coffe_maker_review/,Hamilton Beach FlexBrew 49920 Coffe Maker Review: Worth it or not??,"Using the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew 49920 for my daily caffeine fix has been quite the journey. I have to admit, this coffee maker's unique two-way brewing system intrigued me from the start. The ability to brew a single cup with a pod or make a full 12-cup carafe using my favorite ground coffee sounded like the perfect solution for a household with varying caffeine needs. However, as much as I enjoyed using it, some quirks stood out.

**Design & Build Quality**  
The design is a mix of sleek black and stainless steel, giving the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew 49920 a modern, professional appearance on the countertop. While the materials look durable at first glance, I noticed some drawbacks. The thermal carafe is a fantastic touch, keeping the coffee hot without relying on a warming plate. However, the carafe's pour spout tends to create a mess if you're not careful, leaving coffee dribbles on the counter. Additionally, the water level indicator on the carafe side is black-on-black, making it nearly impossible to read without good lighting.

The machine itself feels sturdy, yet the lid on the single-serve reservoir has an annoying habit of falling off when filling it. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but it certainly disrupts the morning coffee ritual.

[Time to check Hamilton Beach FlexBrew 49920 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/hamilton-beach-flexbrew-49920-review-b0bwgdmltm/)

**Brewing Performance**  
This coffee maker is quick. Whether I‚Äôm brewing a single cup or a full pot, it doesn‚Äôt keep me waiting, which is a blessing during busy mornings. The single-serve side handles K-Cups like a pro, but I found that overfilling the reusable pod caused an ""overload"" error. I learned to stick to a 10-ounce limit for the best taste and no errors.

On the carafe side, the brewing is consistent, and the coffee tastes great. However, if you‚Äôre brewing for a crowd and leaving the machine under a cabinet, the steam release is substantial. I‚Äôd recommend pulling it out to avoid moisture build-up.

**Coffee Flavor**  
The coffee flavor is impressive when brewed correctly. The single-serve side allows customization with a ""bold"" setting that extracts a richer flavor. Using fresh grounds in the carafe ensures a smooth, robust coffee experience. That said, the reusable pod sometimes struggles with finer grounds, leading to weaker flavors compared to pre-packaged K-Cups.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**  
Cleaning the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew 49920 is relatively straightforward. The single-serve side's needle can be unscrewed for easy cleaning, which is a big advantage over machines like Keurig that require a full disassembly for similar maintenance. However, the carafe spout remains tricky, as the coffee dribbles often leave a sticky mess. Regular cleaning of the water reservoir is also a must, as residue builds up quickly.

**Pros**

* Dual-function brewing system (single-serve and full pot).
* Quick brewing time for busy mornings.
* Thermal carafe maintains coffee temperature without scorching it.
* Single-serve side accommodates both K-Cups and reusable pods.
* Easy-to-clean needle for the single-serve system.

**Cons**

* Carafe pour spout creates spills.
* Water level indicator is hard to read.
* Overload errors with reusable single-serve pods.
* Steam release requires careful placement to avoid moisture damage.
* Lid on single-serve reservoir is poorly designed.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to brands like Keurig, which specialize in single-serve brewing, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew 49920 offers more versatility with its dual system. The Keurig machines, like the K-Elite, tend to have a more user-friendly interface and fewer issues with pod overloading. However, they lack the full-pot brewing capability, making the FlexBrew a winner for households needing both options.

On the other hand, the Cuisinart Coffee Center offers similar dual-brewing functionality but tends to edge out Hamilton Beach with more intuitive controls and a sturdier build. That said, Hamilton Beach's thermal carafe is a standout feature, keeping coffee hot longer than Cuisinart‚Äôs glass carafe models.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew 49920 falls into a mid-range price bracket, making it accessible for most coffee lovers. While it‚Äôs not as polished as some higher-end models, the dual-functionality justifies the investment if you‚Äôre looking for flexibility. However, the occasional design flaws and maintenance quirks might deter those who prioritize ease of use over versatility.

Exploring the programmable settings, I discovered that only the carafe side can be set for auto-brew. Why the single-serve side doesn‚Äôt have this feature is beyond me. It seems like an oversight that could have made this coffee maker more versatile. Regardless, the thermal carafe does make up for it by preserving heat without burning the coffee, which is a rare advantage at this price point.

In summary, using this coffee maker has been a mix of satisfaction and minor frustrations. It‚Äôs ideal for those who appreciate a good cup of coffee and need options for brewing quantities, but it‚Äôs not without its flaws. If you‚Äôre willing to overlook the occasional spill and quirky design choices, it could be a solid addition to your kitchen.",1,1738937762.0,CoffeeMakerReviews,0,1.0,False
1ijvx9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1ijvx9b/just_some_motivation_for_everyone_applying_next/,Just some motivation for everyone applying next cycle.,"I see a lot of people on here posting their stats and extracurriculars that are absolutely insane. I‚Äôm here to tell you that if that‚Äôs not you, you still have plenty of hope for acceptance. \*\*\*\*EDIT\*\*\* I am from a very rural area so I understand this does not apply to all of you from metro areas.

For example, my stats are as follows:

* **GPA:** 3.6
* **Science GPA:** 3.4
* **MCAT:** 512 (I know this is a great score; I am by no means saying this is bad.)
* **Volunteering:** 200 hours
* **Research:** 0
* **Non Clinical Work:** 5000 hrs (Including mainly a Accounting Job prior to premed (4000hrs), Coffee Shop, Grounds Crew, and a summer camp)
* **Clinical Work:** 0
* **Shadowing:** 120 hours

I applied to **three** schools (not recommending this, especially if you live in a state without good in-state options), but I needed to be close to family.

I have **two acceptances** and am currently waiting on a decision from the other school where I interviewed.

# My Advice: Control What You Can and Don‚Äôt Play the Comparison Game

1. **Find activities you actually enjoy.** Being able to talk with passion about your extracurriculars is much more important than checking boxes. **Quality over quantity.**
2. **Your writing is crucial.** Show your passion, and get multiple people you trust to review your writing.
3. **List your hobbies.** Schools love to hear what you enjoy doing. It shows that you‚Äôre a well-rounded individual.
4. **Interviews:** The point isn‚Äôt to sell yourself‚Äîthey already know your stats. Don‚Äôt be a record player. **Show them who you are, not just what you‚Äôve done.** Tell stories and let your passion shine. At the end of the day, if that doesn‚Äôt lead to an acceptance, at least you can confidently say you tried your best to represent yourself, and it just wasn‚Äôt the right fit.
5. **This process is brutal.** Give yourself space to have fun. I think that‚Äôs just as important as having crazy stats.

One day I washed out like 3 or 4 of those little plastic disposable fruit bowls. I was going to use them to give my cat his milk in. I specifically placed them in the cabinet over the sink just sitting inside stacked in the right cabinet. So like a half an hour goes by and my cat starts meowing for his milk and I go to grab 1 of those fruit cups and they were all gone and they have never been found. It's shocking and very unsettling because you instantly know that something is watching you. There have been other times and items. They have taken brand new canisters of coffee. They have taken my medications. Also we get random strangers clothing that turns up in our wash. Right now I have this old granny sweater sitting here. We are both middle aged men lol. 

Just wondering about your experiences with misplaced items that you know are spiritual related. Do you think there is meaning in what they take? Are they sending some sort of message? Would love to hear your theories from ppl with these specific experiences. ",8,1738937612.0,Paranormal,7,0.91,False
