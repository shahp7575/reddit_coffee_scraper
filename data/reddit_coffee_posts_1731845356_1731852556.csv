Called off my engagement, what was the right call here?

To give those perspective readers an idea of our background:

 My ex fiance and I have always had a decent dynamic. Charismatic, dancing in the kitchen, craft nights, cozy nights in. I moved in with her after 8 months and figured it would be good, I was helping take care of a pup (Maya) she committed to when we first started dating. She was all in. She helped me with a vehicle and bought it outright about 4 months in... Ill bring that up again later. While living together I was running a landscaping company and we would go on adventures to get bags and so on. I graduated my Masters at the time and opened a clinic in a town nearby where I was renting before. I had this space prior to dating. This was a hard year for me where I was travelling so much and trying to get the business going. We decided to look at homes nearby and she helped clear me of some of my debts so we could have a clean bill. We even signed promissory notes and did it officially. 

There was talk of engagement with the house... although I never wanted that to be a reason that we did. There were some nights my partner would scream at me when I came home to her place...It didnt make me feel safe in place and communication in the beginning was weird. even an event where she paid for gas once and then because she did that she didnt have to help with chores at my mothers cottage ( thank god it was just us two). Some entitlement with money. 

When we found the perfect home I told her parents I was considering proposing and asked permission.... then during the house buying process I felt very alone. She wasnt there till we couldnt sell and had to refinance. She then started gaslighting me under the stress I presume...It was very hard. Due to this I decided to not propose right away. I respectfully told her parents while we move in I will eventually but needed some time. They were excited of course but didnt like this. They proceeded to go behind my back and ask her why I was holding off when she didnt know anything which ended up with us going to counselling for 5 months...She also asked for money back for the vehicle she said was okay not to pay back then out of anger. We were gaining respect and rebuilding communication again with counselling. I then decided to wait a few more months and proposed in our own backyard after I landscaped it! 

I was spending alot of time with work and with some other business people ( some woman ) and she didnt like the late nights although I communicated. I respected her boundariies and met with people for coffee instead... After proposing we had a good couple of months but then noticed some irritating behaviour on her part...We went away on a camping trip and I planned the whole thing, adapted the schedule to her and there were moments where she didnt talk to me. Prior to that in the February we went to Philippines and she didnt talk to me for a whole afternoon because I was working "" but I own a business and needed to do something"" we weren't doing much but being besides the pool. 

She also has this thing about returning the vacuum home from my business and the day we were going to Spain I hurt mayself, bad. She decided that instead of sympathizing she would scream at me when I couldnt move my head because I didnt get some landscaping done and bring the vaccum back... I paid for the whole trip to make up for my debt leading into Janaury I had blood clots ( inconclusive) and I was looking to her for support and she was not really there, said it would get better, and it got worse...admitted myself to hospital and felt like she didnt give me the love I needed.... only after hearing from my neighbour about how is gf was calling doctors to help him come to his MS diagnosis when it occured...and helping him along the path..I hate comparing but I did. 

She then went away for an police course for 2.5 months. I was left with our house, pets, and business. She would come home and say things like "" back from vacation "" we got into an argument over the mortgage which she contributed a big chunk to and proceeded to call me a "" renter in her home "" and also said about my work that "" if i was your mother and your dad worked as much as he did I would of taken everything from him as well like she did"" ....bad overshadowing.... 

She made me jealous of a guy there by spending time with him, having him change her tired for her instead of asking me. She said to me on a date I organized that he gave her this weed pen "" that he didnt want to say it in front of me that it made him horny when he uses it, and asked me if that was weird..."" IM like yeah for sure it is. 

Towards the end of her course I wanted to revisit our conversation. I was struggling with a friend of mine who called off his bachelor I had organized and randomly she said during easter that "" my aunt thinks that you are out of my league... "" I reassured her that she was not accurate and that she was equally amazing as a person. 

We went to revisit the conversations from before because they were bothering me and it was a friday from her coming home. She didnt say anything to me after asking about my mental health and me explaining some thoughts about the argument through messenger. We had a civil night, not close, not apart kind of thing. We got into it the next day and she told me "" your mood was so low that I was happier when you werent home"" I was crying....the most fucked up thing to say I thought and groveled. 

In the coming weeks I had paid for another trip to Guatemala to again repay debts and celebrate her.... but the argument and that reaction bothered me alot... I told her that I thought I couldnt make her happy after being alone for 2.5 months at home...she explained that she felt alone and that I didnt react enough to her memes or reels during her time away ( i did call her and she didnt say anything in these late calls and then would hang up on me or me her ) I felt I did try, it was really awkward honestly. 

Leading to our trip she sent me a reel "" how to love your wife properly "" something in me snapped. I said that she has no perception of the way people receive things when she says them that she can be abrasive and cruel. That I was not excited to get married after just putting a deposit down on suit. 

I had a counselling session alone to figure it out and we decided to go on the trip....we had a really good 1 day. Then it blew up....we argued and I told her that she has put me in such a position to feel so alone and disrespected ...she even said "" I wouldnt want to marry me either""  We did a counselling session with our person there... it was tense and uncomfortable but tried to enjoy the rest of the trip. She made a list of the things that she could improve...and I said I would think about it and just wanted to enjoy our hike up to this volcano....she didnt like that and made comments like "" would you date so and so"" She took a photo of herself and said "" For my tinder profile"" and then "" how long would it take you to date again"" very confusing and weird for me. At the top of the volcano she asked to be intimate and we did...very odd. 

  
For the rest of the trip we made the most of it and had an okay time...when we got back I just wanted to unload so the same day because our flight was early I went to Toronto to talk to my friends. The next day she told me when I got back that her and Liam ( ex ) had a conversation....I did ask details. I was really hurt by that as it seemed spiteful. 

She called me while I was at the cottage, meanwhile me talking to my Mom, sister and brother in law about what to do and how I was so lost in this mess of our situation ( my sister had been talking to us while we were away so she had an idea! They thought a lot of it was disrespectful. 

We were in limbo for about a week before I asked her to see her list and talk think about it. We decided to do counselling. Which resulted in me seeing the messages to the ex. It was a super comfortable conversation. She wasnt flirting but he was making her feel good and when this came up she said she would stop ( previously ), When i saw the messages it said "" Sorry I am in trouble and cant speak to you, you wouldnt of known blah blah blah....victim. We had a few fights in between counselling and yelling matches. She even at one point said maybe there are other homes.... but mentioned she wanted to stay. She even during one of our fights was on her phone during one of our conversations and was crying. 

In counselling we worked on talking to each other and she highlighted that my ex had emotionally abused me and that also her words were harsh....my ex of course thought she was taking a beating. In the weeks onward we worked on forgiveness and I told her I did. 

SPICY : 

I dont know if it was destiny but in the time we were kind of working on it my neighbor I had never met had a conversation about her property to me. She showed me her home, took me around, and so I started to see if I would qualify....we did. We put in an offer and got accepted for way less. 

This was a hard conversation to have but we did....she cried and said "" I cant believe this is our reality"" We had a night of cuddling once.... I always felt that my door was open for her and she could come in at any time and speak to me if she wanted to but she never really did.... 

  
She even did a walk  through and asked to come see the new place. Later that night though she told me she was dating.... which was hard to hear. I took it as spite. Its now been 4 weeks since that moment. I was sad when I moved out and even wrote her a bunch of vulnerable messages saying we could work it out. She is done imo.... and honestly it feels like she didnt really want it. 

  
I am going no contact as much as I can but she does reach out for silly stuff. I moved nearby and our neighbors are all close so it will be hard but eventually I think in time it will be okay. 

  
Please give me your take on this situation. I feel she didnt want it honestly and was stressed by the situation. ",1,1731852462.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I (19F) am in my final year of college, and for the past six months, I’ve been in a secret relationship with my professor, Dr. W (38M). I know it’s ethically messy, but he’s charming, supportive, and made me feel like we had a genuine connection. He always said he was single and hinted that past relationships ended badly because women “couldn’t handle his dedication to academia.”

I believed him because, honestly, who makes that up, right?

Last week, I was in his office, and he left to grab us coffee. While waiting, I noticed his planner on the desk, which had “Anniversary Dinner with Sarah <3” written on it for that night. My heart sank. Long story short, a quick Google and Instagram deep dive revealed Sarah is his WIFE, and they’ve been married for 10 years.

I felt disgusted and betrayed, so I decided if he wanted to play dirty, I’d outdo him.

The next day, during a department seminar (which had faculty, students, and even the dean present), I stood up during the Q&A and asked, “Dr. W, how do you think your wife would feel about you sleeping with your students?”

The room went silent, and Dr. W turned pale. He tried to stammer out some excuse, but I walked out before he could say anything else.

Apparently, my little mic-drop moment spread like wildfire. His wife knows now, the dean is investigating, and Dr. W hasn’t shown up to class since. However, some of my classmates are furious with me, saying I could’ve handled it privately and that I “ruined his career and our program’s reputation.” Others are saying I’m a hero for exposing him.

I noticed that very often in the manga there was an emphasis that Madoka likes to mix all sorts of chemicals and different liquids (for example, in flashbacks they showed juice from all kinds of garbage several times)
When the Madoka arc started, he literally forced some guy to drink a bottle of detergent, then when there was a school festival, while trying to poison Uruma, he mixed a laxative into coffee bottles, also on the cover of volume 4 he is also drawn with some kind of bottle in hand. Therefore, it can be assumed that his first sin is that he could poison someone.
On the other hand, we saw quite a lot of Madoka's flashbacks, in which we were shown that Kyo showed him the feeling of ""destruction"" (then Madoka made a robot out of plasticine, and Kyo broke it, and then gave a monologue about why monsters destroy something) so that perhaps Madoka's first sin was that he broke something that people worked very hard to fix.

Didnt even introduce himself or ask. I notice, ans knowing my dog has been jumpy, ask him not to. I get accused of being rude and 'hostile.'

His relative, on the other side of me, then grabs my jacket and tells me it's fine because 'he just loves animals so much' I explain that's fine, but that doesn't mean he can do that. My dog is partly sighted and can be startled, I didn't want to risk her being alarmed and maybe snapping if she felt threatened, as that's a very different conversation. He just repeated 'but he loves dogs' and after three of these loops I ask him to let go of my clothes.

I am then told i am 'mentally ill' and that since he's the regular I should 'take my drink and fuck right off' I tell him this is rude, he escalates it to a manager and the family just talked over me for several minutes until the manager, who knows me as a regular, comes to talk to me after. They accused me of being rude but I explained I tried to explain myself and they wouldn't listen, then swore at and verbally abused me, them being regulars like myself isn't an excuse.

This turned into a back and forth, and they apologized to the manager for their behaviour, but not me.

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

I had just over a year of sobriety, but have relapsed over the last two weeks. I feel like I would be a lot more successful if I had some accountability. I don't have any sober friends in Seattle, and I think the lack of friends that share my struggle is making a lot more difficult. 

Does anybody have any resources, or experience in what to do in this situation? I feel like I'm flying blind here, and I don't have anyone to talk to about it. 

If anyone is available, I would buy us coffee/dinner/entertainment if I could pick your brain and get a little in-person support.

I'm in Eastlake, but I'm willing to meet up anywhere. I really appreciate the help. If anyone knows of a better local sub to post this in, feel free to let me know.",1,1731851682.0,alcoholfreeseattle,0,1.0,False

Please let me know your ideas!

We've got:
• Blackbutt reserve/National Park walks
• Thrift shopping
• Window shopping at markets/malls
• Cheap eats like coffee at a Cafe or fish n chip lunch
• Stay at home and write date idea lists for broke people 💀

Interested in psychedelics for an existential reset.","I just wonder how much of the difficulty I'm experiencing is due to the hormones and how much is due to facing mortality, the loss of loved ones, looking like crap, looking back over a life's worth of decisions (some good, some bad), and always, always no matter what I'm seeing or doing, being drawn back into the past? And a past in which I felt safe, loved, happy and felt complete irrational confidence that it would all last forever. 

When I was younger, I knew one day I'd have to face tough realities (loss of family members, my own mortality), but I thought, ""But it'll be ok because I'll be older by then and I'll know how to handle it."" I do not know how to handle it. 

Fortunately my mother is still around. I was at her apartment yesterday and saw the brown film on her coffee pot (she only rinses it quickly between making pots of coffee) and I just had this ACHE, this deep yearning for her old, grubby kitchen in my childhood home of 40+ years. 

I don't know if oral HRT is making me feel worse. Even if it is, maybe I need to give it more time (it's been a month). Or maybe I need to change my perspective to get through the time I have left on this planet. Right now I'm relying on alcohol and meditation to get by LOL (I know if I were a better person it would just be the meditation). But I really think I need psychedelic therapy. I can't afford it right now. I have a lot of mushrooms downstairs (legal where I live) but I'm afraid to go all in without a sitter, given my state of mind. ",6,1731851476.0,Menopause,2,1.0,False

1gtdwzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorcummunity/comments/1gtdwzd/echoes_of_the_old_gods/," ""Echoes of the Old Gods"".","Sarah Chen had always known there was something wrong with the Nordic artifacts in basement storage. After three years as the Metropolitan Museum's Assistant Curator of Ancient European History, she'd developed what her colleagues dismissively called ""curator's intuition"" – a sense for when an artifact was misattributed, misdated, or just plain wrong. But the Oseberg collection was different. These artifacts didn't feel wrong; they felt alive.

The leather-bound journal sat heavy in her hands as she made her final rounds of the evening. The museum had acquired it along with several other pieces from a private collector in Oslo, and something about its worn pages called to her. The conservation team had cleared it for handling just this morning, and Sarah had been waiting all day to examine it properly.

The basement storage area was silent save for the soft hum of the climate control system. Row upon row of sealed containers held thousands of artifacts, each carefully cataloged and preserved. Sarah's footsteps echoed off the concrete walls as she made her way to her small office, tucked away in a corner of the vast underground space.

She closed the door behind her, settled into her chair, and opened the journal carefully. The pages were brittle with age, covered in dense handwriting in what appeared to be 19th-century Norwegian. Sarah had been studying the language for months in preparation for this collection, and though her translation skills were still rough, she could make out enough to understand the general meaning.

""The old gods are not dead. They sleep, and in their slumber, they dream of return. I have seen them in the spaces between waking and sleep, in the shadows that move when no wind blows, in the whispers that echo in empty rooms. They are waiting.""

Sarah frowned. This wasn't the kind of academic documentation she'd been expecting. The writing continued:

""The artifacts are not mere relics – they are anchors, tethering the old ones to our world. Each piece holds a fragment of their essence, a splinter of their power. I have collected them to prevent their reassembly, but I fear it may already be too late. They call to each other across distances, pulling themselves together like scattered drops of mercury.""

A soft thud from somewhere in the storage area made Sarah jump. She glanced at her watch – 9:47 PM. The cleaning crew wouldn't arrive for another hour. She was alone down here.

Or at least, she should have been.



The sound came again, closer this time – a dull impact, like something heavy being dropped onto the concrete floor. Sarah set the journal down and moved to her office door, peering out through the small window.

The storage area was dark except for the emergency lighting that cast a sickly green glow over the rows of shelves. Nothing moved in her field of vision, but she could hear something. A scraping sound, like stone against stone, coming from the direction of the Norse collection.

Common sense told her to call security. Instead, she found herself reaching for her keycard and stepping out into the corridor. The journal's words echoed in her mind: ""They call to each other across distances...""

As she approached the Norse collection, the temperature seemed to drop. Her breath formed small clouds in the air, despite the climate control system that should have maintained a constant temperature. The scraping sound had stopped, but there was something else now – a low humming, just at the edge of hearing, like the deepest note of a massive organ pipe.

The case containing the Oseberg artifacts stood open.

Sarah stopped dead in her tracks. She had personally secured that case before leaving for dinner three hours ago. The security seal was broken, fragments of red wax scattered on the floor like drops of blood.

Inside the case, the artifacts were arranged exactly as they had been – except for the small stone amulet that should have been in the center. The amulet, a rough disk of granite carved with intricate knotwork patterns, was missing.

A cold that had nothing to do with the temperature seized Sarah's spine as she heard something move behind her. She turned slowly, already knowing what she would see but hoping desperately that she was wrong.

The amulet hung in the air at eye level, rotating slowly, the knotwork patterns seeming to writhe and shift in the dim light. As she watched, frozen in place, a thin tendril of darkness extended from its surface like smoke in reverse, reaching toward her face.

Sarah ran.



She didn't stop running until she reached her office, slamming the door behind her and fumbling for her phone. Her hands shook as she tried to unlock it, and she nearly dropped it when she saw the screen – no signal. There never was much reception in the basement, but usually she could get at least one bar.

The journal still lay open on her desk. As she caught her breath, new words seemed to write themselves across the page in an inky black scrawl:

""You have seen. Now you are part of it. They will not let you go.""

Sarah backed away from the desk, her heart pounding. The words continued to appear:

""The collection must not be completed. Each piece holds a fragment of their essence. When united, they will make a door, and through that door...""

The writing stopped abruptly. In the distance, Sarah could hear the scraping sound again, closer now, accompanied by the heavy thud of footsteps that seemed to come from something far larger than human.

She grabbed the journal and ran for the emergency stairs. The card reader by the door flashed red when she swiped her keycard. She tried again. Red. A third time. Red.

The footsteps were getting closer. They had an odd rhythm to them, as if whatever was walking had more than two legs. Or perhaps no legs at all.

Sarah turned to face the sound, pressing her back against the emergency door. The journal in her hands had grown warm, almost hot, and she could feel a vibration running through its pages like a distant heartbeat.

At the end of the corridor, something moved in the shadows. Something tall. Something that seemed to shift and change shape as it moved, its outline never quite staying the same from one moment to the next.

The emergency door clicked open behind her.

She didn't look back to see what had opened it. She ran up the stairs, taking them two at a time, the journal clutched to her chest. Behind her, she could hear the thing in the corridor let out a sound that might have been a roar or a laugh – a sound that no human throat could have produced.



Sarah's apartment felt like a fortress after the events at the museum, though she knew it was anything but. She had driven home in a daze, running three red lights and barely noticing. Now she sat at her kitchen table, the journal open before her, a cup of untouched coffee growing cold at her elbow.

The mysterious writing that had appeared in the museum had vanished, leaving only the original Norwegian text. She had been translating it for hours, piecing together a story that seemed too fantastic to be true – yet after what she had seen, how could she doubt it?

The journal's author was a man named Erik Larsson, a Norwegian archaeologist who had worked in the late 1800s. He had discovered something during a dig near the Oseberg burial site – something that had changed his understanding of Norse mythology forever.

""The gods of our ancestors were real,"" he wrote, ""but they were not as our stories remember them. They were older, stranger, more terrible than any saga suggests. What we know as Norse mythology is but a shadow of the truth, a comfortable fiction created to hide something far darker.""

Larsson had spent years collecting artifacts that he believed contained fragments of these ancient beings' power. He had separated them, hiding them in different collections around the world, trying to prevent them from ever being reunited.

""Each piece calls to the others,"" his journal explained. ""They want to be whole again. And there are always those who hear their call – those who would help them return, thinking they will be rewarded with power or knowledge. They do not understand what they would unleash.""

Sarah jumped at a knock at her door. She glanced at the clock – 3:27 AM. Who could be here at this hour?

The knock came again, more insistent this time. Sarah approached the door cautiously, looking through the peephole.

An old man stood in the hallway, stooped with age, wearing a tweed jacket with leather patches at the elbows. He looked exactly like a stereotypical professor, down to the wire-rimmed glasses and neatly trimmed white beard. She had never seen him before in her life.

""Dr. Chen,"" he called through the door, his voice carrying a slight Norwegian accent. ""I know you have the journal. Please, we need to talk. There isn't much time.""

Sarah's hand hovered over the door handle. ""Who are you?""

""My name is Magnus Larsson. Erik Larsson was my grandfather. And like you, I have seen what lives in the shadows of our museums.""



Magnus sat at Sarah's kitchen table, his weathered hands wrapped around a cup of fresh coffee. The journal lay between them like a bomb that might go off at any moment.

""My grandfather spent his life trying to prevent what's happening now,"" Magnus said. ""He understood that the artifacts were dangerous not just as individual pieces, but as a collection. Together, they form something like a key – or perhaps more accurately, a beacon.""

""A beacon for what?"" Sarah asked, though she wasn't sure she wanted to know the answer.

""For the things that came before the gods,"" Magnus replied. ""The beings that taught humanity to fear the dark, to build fires against the night, to huddle together in caves and tell stories to keep the terror at bay. The ones that our ancestors eventually reimagined as gods because the truth was too horrible to face.""

He opened the journal to a page covered in drawings – twisted, impossible shapes that hurt Sarah's eyes to look at. ""These are not accurate representations,"" Magnus said. ""They cannot be represented accurately in any medium humans can create. But they give you an idea.""

""The amulet in the museum,"" Sarah said. ""It moved on its own. It tried to...""

""To touch you, yes,"" Magnus nodded. ""It was marking you. They need human agents to help them gather the pieces. Once marked, a person begins to feel an overwhelming compulsion to collect the artifacts, to bring them together. Many of my grandfather's colleagues fell victim to this compulsion. Some went mad. Others simply disappeared.""

Sarah felt cold despite the warm coffee in her hands. ""How do we stop it?""

""The artifacts must be separated again, hidden in new locations. But first, we have to prevent the collection from being completed. The museum's acquisition of these pieces was no accident. Someone – or something – has been working to bring them together.""

A distant rumble of thunder made them both look up. Through the kitchen window, Sarah could see storm clouds gathering, though the forecast had called for clear skies.

""They know we're talking about them,"" Magnus said quietly. ""They always know.""



Sarah rolled up her sleeve, revealing a pattern of dark lines on her forearm where the tendril of darkness had touched her. The marks looked like the knotwork on the amulet, but they seemed to shift and change when viewed from different angles.

Magnus examined the marks with a frown. ""It's progressing faster than I expected. We don't have much time.""

""Time until what?""

""Until the compulsion becomes too strong to resist. Until you feel an overwhelming need to return to the museum, to help them gather the pieces.""

Sarah pulled her sleeve down, trying not to look at the marks. ""How long?""

""A day, perhaps two. The process varies from person to person, but it always follows the same pattern. First comes the marking. Then dreams – terrible dreams of vast, dark spaces and things that move in them. Then the whispers start, telling you what they want you to do. Finally, the compulsion takes over completely.""

""How do we stop it?""

Magnus reached into his bag and pulled out a small wooden box. Inside was a stone tablet covered in runes that seemed to glow faintly in the dim light of Sarah's kitchen.

""This is one of the few artifacts that can be used against them,"" he explained. ""My grandfather called it the Bindstone. It can break their hold on a marked person, but using it has... consequences.""

""What kind of consequences?""

Before Magnus could answer, all the lights in the apartment went out. Through the kitchen window, Sarah could see that the entire block had gone dark.

""They're here,"" Magnus whispered.



The temperature in the apartment dropped rapidly. Sarah could see her breath in the beam of the flashlight Magnus had produced from his bag. The storm outside had grown stronger, wind howling around the building with an almost vocal quality, as if something vast was calling out in a language too alien for human ears to properly process.

""We need to perform the unbinding ritual,"" Magnus said, opening the wooden box. ""Quickly, before they—""

A crash from the living room cut him off. Something had broken through Sarah's window, something that moved with a liquid grace despite seeming to be made of shadow and sharp edges.

Magnus grabbed Sarah's arm and pulled her toward the bathroom – the only room in the apartment without windows. They barely made it inside before something slammed against the door behind them.

""The marks,"" Magnus said urgently, holding up the Bindstone. ""Show me the marks.""

Sarah rolled up her sleeve again. The knotwork patterns had spread, now covering most of her forearm, and they were moving, writhing under her skin like living things trying to break free.

Magnus pressed the Bindstone against the marks. The runes on its surface flared with a brilliant blue light, and pain shot through Sarah's arm like lightning.

She screamed, but the sound was drowned out by another noise – a vast, furious roar that seemed to come from everywhere at once. The bathroom mirror shattered, and the tiles on the walls cracked in patterns that matched the writhing marks on Sarah's arm.

""Don't fight it,"" Magnus shouted over the chaos. ""Let it happen. Let it burn the marks away.""

Sarah gritted her teeth against the pain. It felt like her arm was on fire, like something was being torn out of her at the cellular level. But beneath the pain, she could feel something else – a presence in her mind that she hadn't even noticed until it began to fade, like a weight being lifted that she hadn't known she was carrying.

The thing outside the bathroom door hit it again, hard enough to splinter the wood. Through the growing crack, Sarah caught a glimpse of something that her mind refused to process – angles that couldn't exist, movements that broke all laws of physics, a darkness that seemed to consume light rather than merely block it.

The Bindstone's light grew brighter, and Sarah's vision began to fade. The last thing she saw before losing consciousness was Magnus beginning to chant in a language that sounded like Norse but far older, far stranger.

Then everything went black.



Sarah woke to silence.

She was lying on her bathroom floor, the broken tiles cold against her cheek. Magnus sat slumped against the wall beside her, blood trickling from his nose and ears, but breathing steadily.

The Bindstone lay between them, its runes now dark and lifeless. Sarah's arm was clear of marks, but she could still feel where they had been, like the memory of a burn.

""Did it work?"" she asked, her voice hoarse.

Magnus opened his eyes slowly. He looked decades older than he had just hours ago, his face deeply lined with exhaustion. ""The marking is gone,"" he said. ""But they'll try again. They always try again.""

Sarah helped him to his feet, and they made their way carefully through the wreckage of her apartment. The sun was rising, casting long shadows through the broken window. The storm had passed, leaving behind a deceptive calm.

""What now?"" Sarah asked.

""Now you have a choice,"" Magnus replied. ""You can walk away from this. Go back to your life, pretend none of this happened. I can help you find a position at another museum, far from the artifacts. Or...""

""Or?""

""Or you can help me. Help me do what my grandfather did – keep the pieces separated, prevent them from ever being reunited. But I warn you, it's not an easy life. They never stop hunting. Never stop trying to gather the pieces.""

Sarah looked around her destroyed apartment – the shattered windows, the claw marks on the walls that didn't seem to follow any natural geometry, the shadows that still seemed to move when viewed from the corner of her eye.

She thought about the journal, about Erik Larsson's lifetime of work. She thought about the thing she had seen in the museum, the impossible thing that had reached for her with tendrils of living darkness.

She thought about all the other artifacts out there, waiting to be found, waiting to be brought together.

""When do we start?"" she asked.



One Year Later

The small café in Amsterdam was crowded with tourists, none of whom paid any attention to the woman sitting alone in the corner, studying an ancient-looking book. Sarah had learned that the best way to hide was often in plain sight.

The journal lay open before her, its pages now filled with her own notes alongside Erik Larsson's. In the year since that night in her apartment she had added extensive documentation of her own encounters, her own discoveries. The journal had become a field guide to horrors that most people couldn't even imagine.

Magnus had taught her well in the months before his disappearance. She tried not to think about the last time she had seen him, in that warehouse in Berlin where they had tracked one of the artifacts. The way the shadows had moved. The sound he had made.

She took another sip of coffee and continued reading her latest notes:

""Artifact #37 located in private collection, Brussels. Bronze age drinking horn, believed to be ceremonial. Shows same temporal distortion effects as other pieces. Current owner reports strange dreams, compulsive behavior. Intervention required before marking occurs.""

Her phone buzzed – a text from an unknown number, but she recognized the code phrase:

""The ravens are circling.""

It was one of their emergency signals. Someone in the network had found something urgent. Sarah closed the journal and slipped it into her bag, leaving enough cash on the table to cover her coffee and then some.

Outside, the Amsterdam streets were busy with afternoon traffic. She made her way through the crowds, keeping to the sunlight. They were less active during the day, less able to reach through the barriers between their world and ours, but she had learned never to let her guard down completely.

Her phone buzzed again:

""Rijksmuseum. Norse exhibition. It's happening again.""

Sarah felt a chill despite the warm spring air. The Rijksmuseum was less than a kilometer away. Too close to be a coincidence. They had led her here, she realized. All this time, she thought she had been hunting them, but they had been leading her exactly where they wanted her to go.



The Rijksmuseum's Norse exhibition was in a special wing, temporarily closed for ""renovation."" Sarah knew better. She could feel the familiar hum of power as she approached, like a subsonic vibration in her bones.

Using the security credentials Magnus had prepared for her – he had thought of everything, right up until the end – she made her way past the barriers and into the closed wing. The air grew colder with each step, and she could hear that sound again, the one that had haunted her dreams for the past year: stone grinding against stone, but somehow wrong, as if the stones were moving of their own accord.

In the main exhibition hall, she found what she had been dreading. The artifacts – dozens of them, from collections all over Europe – had been gathered here. They were arranged in a pattern on the floor, a complex spiral of ancient objects: weapons, jewelry, ceremonial items, each one humming with that terrible energy she had come to know so well.

And in the center of the spiral stood a figure she recognized.

""Hello, Sarah,"" said Dr. Elisabeth Weber, her former colleague from the Metropolitan Museum. ""I've been expecting you.""

Elisabeth's eyes were wrong – all pupil, like black mirrors. The same marking that Sarah had once borne now covered Elisabeth's entire face in writhing patterns of darkness.

""You don't have to do this,"" Sarah said, though she knew it was already too late. The marking had progressed too far.

""But I do,"" Elisabeth smiled, and her teeth were wrong too, too sharp, too numerous. ""They showed me the truth, Sarah. The truth about our world, about history, about everything. The gods we study, the myths we teach – they're all just shadows, just echoes of the real powers that shaped our world. And now they want to come back.""

Sarah reached into her bag, her fingers closing around the new binding stone Magnus had given her before Berlin. It was their last hope, but using it would come at a terrible price.

""They're lying to you,"" Sarah said. ""Whatever they promised you, whatever they showed you – it's not the whole truth. They're using you, just like they tried to use me.""

""Using me?"" Elisabeth laughed, and the sound echoed strangely, as if multiple voices were laughing at once. ""They chose me. They chose us both, but you rejected their gift. Now watch what that gift can do.""

Elisabeth raised her hands, and the artifacts began to move. They rose from the floor, rotating slowly in the air, the spiral pattern they formed beginning to spin like a vast, ancient machine coming to life.

Sarah pulled out the binding stone. Its runes were already beginning to glow, reacting to the power building in the room. But before she could use it, Elisabeth spoke a word – a terrible, impossible word that made Sarah's ears bleed and her vision blur.

The spiral of artifacts spun faster, and in its center, something began to open. It wasn't a door, not really. It was more like a tear in reality itself, a place where the rules of our universe simply ceased to exist.

And through that tear, Sarah caught a glimpse of what waited on the other side.



The vision nearly drove her mad.

She saw them – the things that had come before the gods, the beings that had taught humanity its first fears. They were vast beyond comprehension, complex beyond geometry, terrible beyond any nightmare. They existed in dimensions that human minds couldn't process, moved in ways that broke all natural laws.

And they were reaching through the tear in reality, reaching for our world.

Sarah raised the binding stone, her hands shaking. The words Magnus had taught her came to her lips – not Norse, not any human language, but something older, something that burned her throat as she spoke it.

Elisabeth screamed that impossible word again, and reality rippled. The artifacts spun faster, their ancient power building to a crescendo. The tear widened, and through it came reaching things that might have been tentacles or might have been branches of lightning or might have been neither, twisting in ways that hurt to look at.

Sarah finished the binding phrase.

The stone in her hands exploded with light, not just visible light but something deeper, something that seemed to illuminate the spaces between spaces. The power of it drove Sarah to her knees, but she kept chanting, even as she felt it burning through her, using her life force as fuel for its ancient magic.

Elisabeth's scream changed pitch, became something inhuman. The marks on her face began to burn with a cold, dark fire. The artifacts' spinning slowed, then stopped, hung in the air for a moment like a held breath.

Then everything happened at once.

The tear in reality slammed shut with a sound like a thousand thunderclaps. The artifacts fell to the floor, inert and powerless. Elisabeth collapsed, the marks burning away from her skin, leaving her human again – unconscious but alive.

And Sarah felt the price of the binding magic take hold.

She could feel her years being burned away, could see her hands aging decades in moments as the stone used her own life force to power its magic. Magnus had warned her about this, had told her what using the stone would cost.

""A fair trade,"" she whispered, her voice now that of an old woman. ""A few decades of my life to save the world. Worth it.""

She pulled herself to her feet, her joints aching with new arthritis, and began the work of separating the artifacts. They would need to be scattered again, hidden in new places, kept apart until the next time the old ones tried to return.

Because there would be a next time. There was always a next time.



Ten Years Later

The nursing home in Geneva was comfortable enough, and the staff didn't ask too many questions about why a woman who looked ninety had a birth certificate showing she was barely forty. Sarah had learned that people would accept almost anything if you presented it as unremarkable.

She still kept the journal, still made her notes, though her hands shook too much now to write for long. She had established a network of younger scholars, people who knew what to look for, who could continue the work now that she could no longer do it herself.

Sometimes, on dark nights when the wind howled outside her window, she thought she could still hear them – the old ones, the terrible ones, scratching at the edges of reality, looking for a way back in.

But the artifacts were scattered, the knowledge preserved, the watchers in place. Humanity would survive, ignorant of how close it had come to ending, ignorant of the sacrifices made to protect it.

Sarah closed the journal and looked out her window at the setting sun. In the gathering darkness, she thought she saw something move – a shadow that wasn't quite a shadow, a shape that wasn't quite a shape.

She smiled. Let them watch. Let them plot and plan and gather their strength.

There would always be someone to stand against them. Always be someone to keep the old gods sleeping, to keep the older things at bay.

The price was worth it.

I recently got one of these to try, and I’m experiencing the below issues. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 


Problem one:

On start up it’s really loud, almost like some screw or part is loose vibrating in the machine. It’s way louder than any of the SA’s(delonghi, Jura)  I’ve heard on start up. However, once it’s up and running it’s way quieter. Is this indicative of a defective machine?

Problem 2: 

I’m using Lavazza beans which I know for a fact I like, not only have I had them at home, I’ve had them out. I’ve also had them in multiple different SA machines at what I believe to be the same settings and this is the only machine I don’t like them in. One person in my household loves the coffee it produces, 2 people dislike it and think it’s sour tasting. Modifying the strength down makes it unpleasantly bitter. What suggestions does everyone have? I’ve tried multiple beans and it’s the same story. I just don’t know where to begin to tweak everything. With all the positive reviews. I just can’t imagine it’s the machine, unless it’s a defective machine. 

Grind setting is at finest. 

Body is strong

Strength is strong

7.4 ounce cup coffee
Also did a double shot at 4 ounce cup. I liked this for the first 5 minutes, but as it cooled it got really sour and inedible. 


Tried an americano with 3.2 ounces of espresso, and
4.8 ounces of water. Same strong settings, and while tolerable. It was weak. 

Help!?! I want to make this machine work. I and one other person in my household like everything about this machine except for the coffee. And I fully knowledge it’s a “taste” thing I likely just need to tweak. ",1,1731850854.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

I accept donated ingredients, but it's not necessary to pick up something.  If you donate expired/rotting food I will block you.

I do not do special requests, bake sales, and non profits, so don't ask.  If you see something posted you want to pick up to give to a charity that would be great.  

But do not try to arrange something for me to make things for a specific reason.  My anxiety cannot handle it.

Please do not come here and suggest I take a class, or sell baked goods. That is ablist, unsupportive, and upsetting.

I think this would go without saying, but you need to tell me if you cannot make it.  After I wait an hour no call no show, I will move onto the next person.  If this happens repeatedly I will block you.  No exceptions.

I feel this goes without saying as well but I need to say it.  if you send me a message asking to borrow money I will block you.  No exceptions.

I am autistic/ADHD, and am the only one doing this, so please be kind.

First of all, I still have the turtle biscottis to give away.

Today, I have two pans of mint Oreo chocolate cupcakes to give away.

They are chocolate cupcakes made from scratch, I put in a bit of coffee to enhance the flavor, I ate a bit of the cake I feel you cannot taste the coffee, but I wanted to mention it.  And a mint Oreo is in the middle of the cupcake.

And then, I put a thin layer of chocolate buttercream frosting on the cupcakes to seal in moisture, and piped mint chocolate buttercream frosting on top, and added Christmas sprinkles.

One pan I have more frosting on them then the other pan, if you have a preference please let me know.

These would be great for any chocolate mint lover.  I have two pans, one pan per household.

I will say this until the end of the year, I will go through a lot of sticks of butter, butter flavored Crisco, and powdered sugar.  If you want to, please donate those three things.  I would very much appreciate it.  

Of course, donations are not required to pick up something.

I went on a date with a girl, she was perfectly my type, she's a little tan, has a great eye to face ratio and has the most stunning and enchanting smile. She's a little short and was dressed in a traditional red kurtha. I was on my knees, I was literally about to cry, I had my little chat with God, I said ""Do I deserve this?"". But then, instincts kicked in, I mustered up some courage and held my tears. She was walking towards me, everything slowed down, the pigeons were still, people's lips slowed down, a breeze of wind waved her dupatta. I couldn't hear a thing, I could only hear her shouting my name in a super slow rhythm..""Accctuuaatoorrrr"" (Not my actual name).

I blushed hard, tear drop was about to come out, but I withheld it. I'm not a shy person and people call me ""guffadi"", but at that moment, I couldn't utter a single word. And then, to add the fuel to the flame she said, ""Hi, mero Batman.""😭At that point I was numb, I blushed like crazy, malai ra raato tamatar lai comparison garyo vane, ma badhi raato dekhinthe. I complimented her, I said, ""You're the best thing that happened to me."" Then I complimented about her eyes and how she had the perfect eyes-face ratio. Then, we proceeded to the restaurant. As we were walking, a gust of wind hit us, her perfect-silky, luscious, hair touched my skin, I felt as if the wind was begging me to touch her hair. I caressed her hair behind the ears and it revealed the green, ivory coloured jhumka, that I gifted.

We walked to the restaurant and ordered some coffee. At the mean-time, I locked my eyes into her. She gave a subtle look at my lips. I didn't take the hint, she kept looking at me with those star-like eyes, there was a sense of lust but her eyes concealed it. After, making her wait for a brief moment of time, she bit her lips and I proceeded to get a taste of the lipstick. I leaned forward, she leaned with her eyes closed, revealing that feeling of lust and endearment. As soon as my skin touched hers, I got erection and was hard as a rock. Then, I woke up with a morning wood, only to realize that all of this was a dream and a girl, with the perfect eyes-face ratio doesn't exist. ""Haha"", I laughed and then I had a sudden urge to take a shit. Thank you for your time..🙏🙏",11,1731850282.0,NepalSocial,25,0.87,False

1gtdltt,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1gtdltt/possibly_pregnant/,Possibly pregnant?,"My husband and I just started trying recently and I think I might be pregnant.  I started having symptoms at 5 DPO, mostly mild cramping and some slight breast tenderness. Now at 12 DPO I have very tender, sore, and heavy breasts (any thing on them is almost too much), nausea and throwing up, bloating, constipation, dizziness, super smell,  food aversions (coffee and chicken are a big heck no now), fatigue even after a total of 12 hours of sleep, weird vivid dreams, peeing a lot especially at night, a heaviness or fullness in my pelvis, and lower back pain.

 I know my body pretty well, id like to think, and my PMS is not to this degree or this many symptoms.  But I have taken a pregnancy test today and it was negative..  is it delusional to think I’m pregnant?  I realize it’s still really early, I just don’t want to be let down.  Last year while on the patch, I ended up having a chemical pregnancy, and even though we weren’t trying it kinda broke my heart and I guess I’m just stuck between wanting to be realistic and get a bit excited and not wanting to get too excited so I’m not so disappointed..  

I just needed to vent, when I’ve brought it up to family or friends they just tell me to stay positive and they are right but I just needed to reach out to a wider, less biased crowd I guess..

1gtdk96,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/1gtdk96/small_success/,Small success,"Just wanted to write this down because I'm happy about this morning. 

This morning I took an unexpectedly long walk and got home hungry so I decided to have a cookie and coffee as a snack before jumping in the shower and having breakfast. Then I ate a second cookie. Then I was still hungry and eyeing another cookie and finally realized I should instead have a full breakfast now instead of after my shower. So I did and now I'm good. 

For me, it's mainly about eating regularly and keeping it healthy. I can have sweets, but not on their own. They need to be dessert, after a good meal with protein, fiber, and fat. Having a cookie on it's own was not a good idea and was leading to overeating (which is different than binging, but for me it does seem that overeating is the start and then over time of regular overeating I end up binging, so it's good to nip that in the bud).

2. **He Remembers the Details** When a guy likes you, he’ll remember little things you mention, like your favorite coffee or stories you’ve shared. This shows he’s attentive and values what you say.
3. **Frequent Eye Contact** Maintained eye contact can indicate interest, especially if he holds your gaze a little longer than usual.
4. **He Finds Reasons to Touch You** Whether it's a gentle touch on the arm or playful nudges, small touches can show he’s trying to build a deeper connection.
5. **He Seems Nervous Around You** If he fidgets, blushes, or stumbles over his words, it might be because he’s worried about making a good impression.
6. **He Asks Questions About You** Showing genuine curiosity about your life, hobbies, or opinions can signal that he wants to know you better.
7. **He Mirrors Your Actions** People often subconsciously mimic the body language of those they’re interested in. Notice if he mirrors your gestures or posture.
8. **He Teases You Playfully** Playful teasing can be a way to flirt. If he’s teasing you in a lighthearted way, he may be trying to show he likes you.
9. **He’s Quick to Respond** If he replies to your messages quickly and keeps the conversation going, it’s a sign he values your interactions.
10. **He’s Supportive and Encouraging** If he’s always rooting for you, celebrating your successes, or offering support, it shows he cares and respects you.

These signs can indicate that a guy may have feelings for you. Keep an eye out for a mix of these behaviors to get a better sense of his interest!

I'm here to hopefully meet someone to start a relationship, I'll tell you my location later on, but must be open to long distance love. Other than that, write me anytime!, I'm available to talk at any time and on any place you'd like (skype, teams, zoom, reddit, etc)

I'm looking for someone to communicate daily so we can build our relationship and hopefully marry someday. I'm not located on the U.S, rather on Latin America, but we can make plans to meet.

Hi I'm F(23) nag graduate ako last year then after 10 days nakapag start na ng work with a below minimum salary (450 a day yan minimum sa Province ko) mga first few months ng salary ko binayaran ko mga utang ko for my thesis and graduation fees kaya di ako nakapag ipon btw August ako nakapag work so yung first 4 months ko survival lang talaga, utang, bayad bills and ambag sa food sa bahay napupuntahan ng sahod ko pero at the same time nakakapag coffee with friends naman once a month plus nakakapag mcdo din hehe and shopee ng clothes na need ko for my work. So ayun na nga 2024 came and sabi ko mag iipon nako pero binawi ko din agad kasi ganon padin sahod ko mababa padin so sabi ko sa sarili ko na ibibigay ko tong 2024 na to for myself na mun mag tatravel ako, bibilhin mga basics needs ko and diko gugutumin sarili ko but at the same time nag babayad padin akong internet bills and ambag sa food and electric bill namin. So ayun na nga ang buong 2024 ko is nakapag travel naman ako nagawa kona yung ibibigay ko muna sa sarili ko to reward nalang kumbaga. Then ang plan ko next year 2025 is lahat ng sahod ko puro sa pamilya at bahay nalang namin, babawasan or iiwasan kona yung mga travel and pag gastos.

But the problem is balak kona mag resign sa work ko next year probably sa month of May. 1 year and 9 months nako non sakanila, pero ngayon kasi after ko mag 1 year na promote nga ako dumami workload ko pero sa salary increase pahirapan. Marunong naman ako, madali din akong matuto at maka adapt pero dahil yata bata ako at first work experience ko sila eh na tatake for granted nako. Nag 1 year ako pero ang increase ko is 70+ pesos tapos mind you guys ang position ko pinaka mataas sa company nila pero ang baba ng sahod ko. Ngayon balak ko mas madaliin na pag reresign, may utang na loob naman ako kaya balak ko sana Sa MAY nako mag resign para di sila mahirapan sa mga upcoming events namin pero kasi gusto kona maka hanap ng work na mababayaran ako ng tama, and mga kasama ko is nag babalak nadin umalis sa January at ayoko naman maiwan dahil for sure mas kawawa na naman ako non, pero at the same time takot akong mag resign at baka di ako makahanap agad (panganay ako). So tama bang mag resign nako after makuha 13th month pay at bonus ko?

It has affected my life gravely as I am not able to spend a longer time outside/ drink alcohol/ wear makeup /wear contact lenses. I have anxiety and every day is a struggle as my eyes constantly keep getting inflamated, I have migranes, blurry vision, stardust in the morning etc. I was prescribed softacort (steroid) and I had a very bad reaction and couldn't see normally for weeks. I use eye drops and gel for night but I get the feeling that they only make my eyes worse, some of them cause pain and redness after applying them so I am only using homeopathic eye drops at the moment. I have tried most methods that I could find online (warm compresses, gluten free diet, no coffee, lid washing, humidifier, stopped taking the pill) and nothing seems to help. I had an allergy test for air particles and everything is negative. 

Sooo I had a talk with another girl who told me she had the same symptoms two years ago and tried everything, also pulsating light therapy etc. She found out her glasses were not the right prescription but changing the glasses also didn't help. So she was suggested a no touch prk surgery, which she did a year ago and now she says she has a veeery mild dry eye but it is way better than before surgery. 

My question is if anyone else had a similar experience because you can hear very often about prk making dry eyes worse but she swears it helped her a lot. 
I have astigmatism and I would need - 0.5 diopter more on both lenses because of that but I am thinking maybe I will just do the surgery and won't waste money on new lenses when they might not work anyway. I cannot live like this anymore, this condition has ruined my life so I need to do something about it very soon. 

What do you guys think?

I’ve had a hell of a week. 

My spouse and I have had a very very tough year. Things were looking up in August when I got a job that allowed us space and me some income. My spouse has been the primary breadwinner for our 6 years of marriage. I work but I don’t make nearly as much as him. 

I have been working for 3 months. I left our home October 3rd to do hurricane recovery work in Florida. My spouse and I were getting along over text and the phone, then something changed with him October 26th. He ceased answering my calls or texts. I came home on Monday, November 11th. I didn’t see him till the next day, the 12th. On the 14th he made me a cup of coffee then told me he was moving out December 1st. There was no prior warning of this. I was hurt and angry and in disbelief. 

I found paperwork yesterday indicating he has retained a lawyer and has had a lease somewhere else since November 1st. Again, he is the primary earner. I put the paperwork in my car trunk to make copies of it. When I was getting ready to leave in a state of shock, he came home. I told him I found the paperwork. He said “What paperwork?”

I left for the appointment. When I came home last night, all his stuff was gone. His bed. One of our cats. Our internet router. 

He does not intend to pay rent or utilities on this rental home I live in. I only have $3000 saved up from my three months of work. My work is seasonal, herbicide application. I have no hours or income right now. 

My dad is driving to Ohio from Chicago to be with me and help me get through this week. We are going to look for a lawyer for me.

What is likely to happen? His rental is half a mile down the street. I don’t even know where to start. Should I start by calling and getting Internet back on? Is he going to have to pay rent here until I am on my feet? I moved to this state for this job. We are both on the lease until August of next year. 

Please give me some advice and perspective. Thank you. ",8,1731849171.0,legaladvice,2,0.9,False

**2019** - I'm in my final year of high school and I meet this extremely cute girl. Let's call her R. Me and R become good friends and I start developing very strong feelings for her. Long story short unfortunately it turned out her personality wasn't as nice and I would constantly be lead on and also have my character defamed which in turn destroyed a lot of my confidence especially when she chose someone else over me. Ended up being a terrible canon event for me going forward.

Fast forward to 2024 - Still haven't dated at all or been in any relationship. Feeling mostly hopeless in my love life mostly due to what happened 5 years ago and the thoughts of ""it would've happened already"" always lingering. I do like myself but I often think society thinks otherwise (I'm 5'7, skinny build) which is probably a byproduct of being online a lot. I would always think every girl saw me the same way R did which was undesirable even though I know realistically that's impossible.

I start working a new boring job at a coffee shop and some months later I see this regular customer come in. Let's call her D. She's very sweet, cute and at first I didn't think much of it since I see tons of customers all the time but as she started regularly greeting me and giving banter in ways most customers wouldn't, I started to grow some attraction towards her. Now because of what happened in the past I remained pretty guarded in how I felt about her (didn't want to be delusional about the whole thing) so I just kept it to myself. As time went on my feelings for her started getting stronger.

I wasn't sure if she was just being friendly or if she was interested (some of the things she would say would imply she's interested I guess?). I wanted to ask her out multiple times but I hesitated with excuses every time (Don't wanna get in trouble with management, prolly not good enough for her, yada yada yada). Eventually there was a long dry spell where I did not see her due to my schedule being shifted to times she doesn't visit the shop which frustrated me. It also taught me that opportunities will pass you by if you delay it too long. This week however I saw her again and decided it's time to lay these thoughts/feelings to rest and shoot my shot.

I asked if I could give her my number and **she said yes!** She texted very soon after and now we just need to plan a date. Now I don't know exactly what's going to happen next with me and D but I'm glad I took the step I did. I'm glad I didn't allow my negative thoughts continue to take away yet another opportunity for a chance of love.

I guess the moral of this story here is someone out there **WILL** give you a chance regardless of your past experiences or what you think of your yourself. You are your own biggest critic and your negative thoughts most of the time do not align with others. I know it's scary, believe me, but sometimes to get the things you want you have to do something you've never done before. Even if he/she says no, you don't have to live with the regret of ""what if?"" and you move on to the next.

Bee Movie

By Jerry Seinfeld



NARRATOR:

(Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard)

According to all known laws

of aviation,

 :

there is no way a bee

should be able to fly.

 :

Its wings are too small to get

its fat little body off the ground.

 :

The bee, of course, flies anyway

 :

because bees don't care

what humans think is impossible.

BARRY BENSON:

(Barry is picking out a shirt)

Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

 :

Ooh, black and yellow!

Let's shake it up a little.

JANET BENSON:

Barry! Breakfast is ready!

BARRY:

Coming!

Hang on a second.

\- I can't. I'll pick you up.

\- Ow! That's me!



JANET:

\- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.

\- Bye!

(Barry flies out the door)

JANET:

Barry, I told you,

stop flying in the house!

newspaper)

BARRY:

\- A little. Special day, graduation.

ADAM:

Never thought I'd make it.

(Barry pulls away from the house and continues driving)

BARRY:

Three days grade school,

three days high school...

ADAM:

Those were awkward.

BARRY:

Three days college. I'm glad I took

a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

highway)

complicated Honey-making machines)

have worked your whole life

 :

to get to the point where you

can work for your whole life.

 :

Honey begins when our valiant Pollen

Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

 :

 :

ground with fly-swatters, newspapers and boots. He lifts a thumbs up but

you can hear him groan)

BARRY:

\- Not enough.

TOUR GUIDE:

Here we have our latest advancement,

the Krelman.

(They pass by a turning wheel with Bees standing on pegs, who are each

wearing a finger-shaped hat)

Barry:

\- Wow, What does that do?

TOUR GUIDE:

\- Catches that little strand of honey

 :

that hangs after you pour it.

Saves us millions.

ADAM:

(Intrigued)

Can anyone work on the Krelman?

TOUR GUIDE:

Of course. Most bee jobs are

small ones.

But bees know that every small job,

if it's done well, means a lot.

 :

But choose carefully

 :

because you'll stay in the job

you pick for the rest of your life.

(Everyone claps except for Barry)

BARRY:

The same job the rest of your life?

I didn't know that.

ADAM:



What's the difference?

TOUR GUIDE:

You'll be happy to know that bees,

as a species, haven't had one day off

 :

in 27 million years.

BARRY:

(Upset)

So you'll just work us to death?

 :

We'll sure try.

(Everyone on the bus laughs except Barry. Barry and Adam are walking back

home together)

ADAM:

Wow! That blew my mind!

BARRY:

""What's the difference?""

How can you say that?

 :

One job forever?

That's an insane choice to have to make.

ADAM:

I'm relieved. Now we only have

to make one decision in life.

BARRY:

But, Adam, how could they

never have told us that?

ADAM:

Why would you question anything?

We're bees.

 :

We're the most perfectly

BARRY:

You ever think maybe things

work a little too well here?

ADAM:

Like what? Give me one example.

(Barry and Adam stop walking and it is revealed to the audience that

hundreds of cars are speeding by and narrowly missing them in perfect

unison)

BARRY:

I don't know. But you know

what I'm talking about.

ANNOUNCER:

(The Pollen jocks fly in, circle around and landing in line)

I've never seen them this close.

BARRY:

ADAM:

to trucks, which drive away)

Jock. You have to be bred for that.

ADAM==

Right.

(Barry and Adam are covered in some pollen that floated off of the Pollen

Jocks)

BARRY:

than you and I will see in a lifetime.

ADAM:

It's just a status symbol.

Bees make too much of it.

BARRY:

Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it

and the ladies see you wearing it.

\- Couple of Hive Harrys.

POLLEN JOCK #1:

\- Let's have fun with them.

GIRL BEE #1:

It must be dangerous

being a Pollen Jock.

BARRY:

Yeah. Once a bear pinned me

against a mushroom!

 :

He had a paw on my throat,

and with the other, he was slapping me!

(Slaps Adam with his hand to represent his scenario)

GIRL BEE #2:

\- Oh, my!

BARRY:

\- I never thought I'd knock him out.

GIRL BEE #1:

(Looking at Adam)

What were you doing during this?

ADAM:

Obviously I was trying to alert the authorities.

BARRY:

I can autograph that.



(The pollen jocks walk up to Barry and Adam, they pretend that Barry and

Adam really are pollen jocks.)

POLLEN JOCK #1:

A little gusty out there today,

wasn't it, comrades?

BARRY:

Yeah. Gusty.

POLLEN JOCK #1:

We're hitting a sunflower patch

six miles from here tomorrow.

BARRY:

\- Six miles, huh?

ADAM:

\- Barry!

POLLEN JOCK #2:

A puddle jump for us,

but maybe you're not up for it.

BARRY:

\- Maybe I am.

ADAM:

\- You are not!

POLLEN JOCK #1:

We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

 :

What do you think, buzzy-boy?

Are you bee enough?

BARRY:

I might be. It all depends

on what 0900 means.

(The scene cuts to Barry looking out on the hive-city from his balcony at

night)

MARTIN:



Hey, Honex!

BARRY:

Dad, you surprised me.

MARTIN:

You decide what you're interested in?

BARRY:

\- Well, there's a lot of choices.

\- But you only get one.

 :

Do you ever get bored

doing the same job every day?

MARTIN:

Son, let me tell you about stirring.

 :

You grab that stick, and you just

move it around, and you stir it around.

 :

You get yourself into a rhythm.

It's a beautiful thing.

BARRY:

You know, Dad,

the more I think about it,

 :

maybe the honey field

just isn't right for me.

MARTIN:

You were thinking of what,

making balloon animals?

 :

That's a bad job

for a guy with a stinger.

 :



Janet, your son's not sure

he wants to go into honey!

JANET:

\- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.

BARRY:

\- I'm not trying to be funny.

MARTIN:

You're not funny! You're going

into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

JANET:

\- You're gonna be a stirrer?

BARRY:

\- No one's listening to me!

MARTIN:

Wait till you see the sticks I have.

BARRY:

I could say anything right now.

I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

(Barry's parents don't listen to him and continue to ramble on)

MARTIN:

Let's open some honey and celebrate!

BARRY:

Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.

Shave my antennae.

 :

Shack up with a grasshopper. Get

a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!

JANET:

I'm so proud.

(The scene cuts to Barry and Adam waiting in line to get a job)

ADAM:

\- We're starting work today!



BARRY:

\- Today's the day.

ADAM:

Come on! All the good jobs

will be gone.

BARRY:

Yeah, right.

JOB LISTER:

Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,

stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

BEE IN FRONT OF LINE:

\- Is it still available?

JOB LISTER:

\- Hang on. Two left!

 :

One of them's yours! Congratulations!

Step to the side.

ADAM:

\- What'd you get?

BEE IN FRONT OF LINE:

\- Picking crud out. Stellar!

(He walks away)

ADAM:

Wow!

JOB LISTER:

Couple of newbies?

ADAM:

Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

JOB LISTER:

Make your choice.

(Adam and Barry look up at the job board. There are hundreds of constantly

changing panels that contain available or unavailable jobs. It looks very

confusing)



ADAM:

\- You want to go first?

BARRY:

\- No, you go.

ADAM:

Oh, my. What's available?

JOB LISTER:

Restroom attendant's open,

not for the reason you think.

ADAM:

\- Any chance of getting the Krelman?

JOB LISTER:

\- Sure, you're on.

(Puts the Krelman finger-hat on Adam's head)

(Suddenly the sign for Krelman closes out)

 :

I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

(Takes Adam's hat off)

Wax monkey's always open.

ADAM:

The Krelman opened up again.

 :

What happened?

JOB LISTER:

A bee died. Makes an opening. See?

He's dead. Another dead one.

 :

Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

 :

Dead from the neck up.

Dead from the neck down. That's life!



ADAM:

Oh, this is so hard!

(Barry remembers what the Pollen Jock offered him and he flies off)

Heating, cooling,

stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

 :

humming, inspector number seven,

lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

 :

mite wrangler. Barry, what

do you think I should... Barry?

(Adam turns around and sees Barry flying away)

 :

Barry!

POLLEN JOCK:

All right, we've got the sunflower patch

in quadrant nine...

ADAM:

(Through phone)

What happened to you?

Where are you?

BARRY:

\- I'm going out.

ADAM:

\- Out? Out where?

BARRY:

\- Out there.

ADAM:

\- Oh, no!

BARRY:

I have to, before I go

to work for the rest of my life.

ADAM:



You're gonna die! You're crazy!

(Barry hangs up)

Hello?

POLLEN JOCK #2:

Another call coming in.

 :

If anyone's feeling brave,

there's a Korean deli on 83rd

 :

that gets their roses today.

BARRY:

Hey, guys.

POLLEN JOCK #1 ==

\- Look at that.

POLLEN JOCK #2:

\- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

LOU LO DUVA:

Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

POLLEN JOCK #1:

It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

(Puts hand on Barry's shoulder)

LOU LO DUVA:

(To Barry) Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

BEE WITH CLIPBOARD:

(To Barry) Sign here, here. Just initial that.

 :

\- Thank you.

LOU LO DUVA:

\- OK.

 :

You got a rain advisory today,

 :



and as you all know,

bees cannot fly in rain.

 :

So be careful. As always,

watch your brooms,

 :

hockey sticks, dogs,

birds, bears and bats.

 :

Also, I got a couple of reports

of root beer being poured on us.

 :

Murphy's in a home because of it,

babbling like a cicada!

BARRY:

\- That's awful.

LOU LO DUVA:

(Still talking through megaphone)

\- And a reminder for you rookies,

 :

bee law number one,

absolutely no talking to humans!

 :

All right, launch positions!

POLLEN JOCKS:

(The Pollen Jocks run into formation)

 :

Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,

buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

LOU LU DUVA:

Black and yellow!

POLLEN JOCKS:



Hello!

POLLEN JOCK #1:

(To Barry)You ready for this, hot shot?

BARRY:

Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

POLLEN JOCK's:

Wind, check.

 :

\- Antennae, check.

\- Nectar pack, check.

 :

\- Wings, check.

\- Stinger, check.

BARRY:

Scared out of my shorts, check.

LOU LO DUVA:

OK, ladies,

 :

let's move it out!

 :

Pound those petunias,

you striped stem-suckers!

 :

All of you, drain those flowers!

(The pollen jocks fly out of the hive)

BARRY:

Wow! I'm out!

 :

I can't believe I'm out!

 :

So blue.



 :

I feel so fast and free!

 :

Box kite!

(Barry flies through the kite)

 :

Wow!

 :

Flowers!

(A pollen jock puts on some high tech goggles that shows flowers similar to

heat sink goggles.)

POLLEN JOCK:

This is Blue Leader.

We have roses visual.

 :

Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

 :

Roses!

POLLEN JOCK #1:

30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

 :

Stand to the side, kid.

It's got a bit of a kick.

(The pollen jock fires a high-tech gun at the flower, shooting tubes that

suck up the nectar from the flower and collects it into a pouch on the gun)

BARRY:

That is one nectar collector!

POLLEN JOCK #1==

\- Ever see pollination up close?

BARRY:

\- No, sir.

POLLEN JOCK #1:



(Barry and the Pollen jock fly over the field, the pollen jock sprinkles

pollen as he goes)

 :

I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it

over here. Maybe a dash over there,

 :

a pinch on that one.

See that? It's a little bit of magic.

BARRY:

That's amazing. Why do we do that?

POLLEN JOCK #1:

That's pollen power. More pollen, more

flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

BARRY:

Cool.

POLLEN JOCK #1:

I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.

could be daisies. Don't we need those?

POLLEN JOCK #2:

Copy that visual.

 :

Wait. One of these flowers

seems to be on the move.

POLLEN JOCK #1:

Say again? You're reporting

a moving flower?

POLLEN JOCK #2:

Affirmative.

(The Pollen jocks land near the ""flowers"" which, to the audience are

obviously just tennis balls)

KEN:

(In the distance) That was on the line!



POLLEN JOCK #1:

This is the coolest. What is it?

POLLEN JOCK #2:

I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

 :

It smells good.

Not like a flower, but I like it.

POLLEN JOCK #1:

Yeah, fuzzy.

(Sticks his hand on the ball but it gets stuck)

POLLEN JOCK #3==

Chemical-y.

(The pollen jock finally gets his hand free from the tennis ball)

POLLEN JOCK #1:

Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.

(The pollen jocks turn around and see Barry lying his entire body on top of

one of the tennis balls)

POLLEN JOCK #2:

My sweet lord of bees!

POLLEN JOCK #3:

Candy-brain, get off there!

POLLEN JOCK #1:

(Pointing upwards)

Problem!

(A human hand reaches down and grabs the tennis ball that Barry is stuck

to)

BARRY:

\- Guys!

POLLEN JOCK #2:

\- This could be bad.

POLLEN JOCK #3:

Affirmative.

(Vanessa Bloome starts bouncing the tennis ball, not knowing Barry is stick

to it)



BARRY==

Very close.

 :

Gonna hurt.

 :

Mama's little boy.

(Barry is being hit back and forth by two humans playing tennis. He is

still stuck to the ball)

POLLEN JOCK #1:

You are way out of position, rookie!

KEN:

Coming in at you like a MISSILE!

(Barry flies past the pollen jocks, still stuck to the ball)

BARRY:

(In slow motion)

Help me!

POLLEN JOCK #2:

I don't think these are flowers.

POLLEN JOCK #3:

\- Should we tell him?

POLLEN JOCK #1:

\- I think he knows.

BARRY:

What is this?!

KEN:

Match point!

 :

You can start packing up, honey,

because you're about to EAT IT!

(A pollen jock coughs which confused Ken and he hits the ball the wrong way

with Barry stuck to it and it goes flying into the city)

BARRY:



Yowser!

(Barry bounces around town and gets stuck in the engine of a car. He flies

into the air conditioner and sees a bug that was frozen in there)

BARRY:

Ew, gross.

(The man driving the car turns on the air conditioner which blows Barry

into the car)

GIRL IN CAR:

There's a bee in the car!

 :

\- Do something!

DAD DRIVING CAR:

\- I'm driving!

BABY GIRL:

(Waving at Barry)

\- Hi, bee.

(Barry smiles and waves at the baby girl)

GUY IN BACK OF CAR:

\- He's back here!

 :

He's going to sting me!

GIRL IN CAR:

Nobody move. If you don't move,

he won't sting you. Freeze!

(Barry freezes as well, hovering in the middle of the car)

 :

GRANDMA IN CAR==

He blinked!

(The grandma whips out some bee-spray and sprays everywhere in the car,

climbing into the front seat, still trying to spray Barry)

GIRL IN CAR:

Spray him, Granny!

DAD DRIVING THE CAR:

What are you doing?!

(Barry escapes the car through the air conditioner and is flying high above



the ground, safe.)

BARRY:

Wow... the tension level

out here is unbelievable.

(Barry sees that storm clouds are gathering and he can see rain clouds

moving into this direction)

 :

I gotta get home.

 :

Can't fly in rain.

 :

Can't fly in rain.

(A rain drop hits Barry and one of his wings is damaged)

 :

Can't fly in rain.

(A second rain drop hits Barry again and he spirals downwards)

Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

(WW2 plane sound effects are played as he plummets, and he crash-lands on a

plant inside an apartment near the window)

VANESSA BLOOME:

Ken, could you close

the window please?

KEN==

Hey, check out my new resume.

I made it into a fold-out brochure.

 :

You see?

(Folds brochure resume out)

Folds out.

(Ken closes the window, trapping Barry inside)

BARRY:

Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

(Barry tries to fly away but smashes into the window and falls again)

 :

What was that?



(Barry keeps trying to fly out the window but he keeps being knocked back

because the window is closed)

Maybe this time. This time. This time.

This time! This time! This...

 :

Drapes!

(Barry taps the glass. He doesn't understand what it is)

That is diabolical.

KEN:

It's fantastic. It's got all my special

skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

ANDY:

What's number one? Star Wars?

KEN:

Nah, I don't go for that...

(Ken makes finger guns and makes ""pew pew pew"" sounds and then stops)

 :

...kind of stuff.

BARRY:

No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.

They're out of their minds.

KEN:

When I leave a job interview, they're

flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

BARRY:

(Looking at the light on the ceiling)

There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

(Starts flying towards the lightbulb)

 :

I don't remember the sun

having a big 75 on it.

(Barry hits the lightbulb and falls into the dip on the table that the

humans are sitting at)

KEN:



I predicted global warming.

 :

I could feel it getting hotter.

At first I thought it was just me.

(Andy dips a chip into the bowl and scoops up some dip with Barry on it and

is about to put it in his mouth)

 :

Wait! Stop! Bee!

(Andy drops the chip with Barry in fear and backs away. All the humans

freak out)

 :

Stand back. These are winter boots.

(Ken has winter boots on his hands and he is about to smash the bee but

Vanessa saves him last second)

VANESSA:

Wait!

 :

Don't kill him!

(Vanessa puts Barry in a glass to protect him)

KEN:

You know I'm allergic to them!

This thing could kill me!

VANESSA:

Why does his life have

less value than yours?

KEN:

Why does his life have any less value

than mine? Is that your statement?

VANESSA:

I'm just saying all life has value. You

don't know what he's capable of feeling.

(Vanessa picks up Ken's brochure and puts it under the glass so she can

carry Barry back to the window. Barry looks at Vanessa in amazement)

KEN:



My brochure!

VANESSA:

There you go, little guy.

(Vanessa opens the window and lets Barry out but Barry stays back and is

still shocked that a human saved his life)

KEN:

I'm not scared of him.

It's an allergic thing.

VANESSA:

Put that on your resume brochure.

KEN:

My whole face could puff up.

ANDY:

Make it one of your special skills.

KEN:

Knocking someone out

is also a special skill.

(Ken walks to the door)

Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

 :

\- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?

VANESSA:

\- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

 :

(Vanessa tries to close door)

KEN==

\- You could put carob chips on there.

VANESSA:

\- Bye.

(Closes door but Ken opens it again)

KEN:

\- Supposed to be less calories.



VANESSA:

\- Bye.

(Closes door)

(Fast forward to the next day, Barry is still inside the house. He flies

into the kitchen where Vanessa is doing dishes)

BARRY==

(Talking to himself)

I gotta say something.

 :

She saved my life.

I gotta say something.

 :

All right, here it goes.

(Turns back)

Nah.

 :

What would I say?

 :

I could really get in trouble.

 :

It's a bee law.

You're not supposed to talk to a human.

 :

I can't believe I'm doing this.

 :

I've got to.

(Barry disguises himself as a character on a food can as Vanessa walks by

again)

 :

Oh, I can't do it. Come on!

 :

No. Yes. No.

 :

Do it. I can't.



 :

How should I start it?

(Barry strikes a pose and wiggles his eyebrows)

""You like jazz?""

No, that's no good.

(Vanessa is about to walk past Barry)

Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

 :

...Hi!

(Vanessa gasps and drops the dishes in fright and notices Barry on the

counter)

 :

I'm sorry.

VANESSA:

\- You're talking.

BARRY:

\- Yes, I know.

VANESSA:

(Pointing at Barry)

You're talking!

BARRY:

I'm so sorry.

VANESSA:

No, it's OK. It's fine.

I know I'm dreaming.

 :

But I don't recall going to bed.

BARRY:

Well, I'm sure this

is very disconcerting.

VANESSA:

This is a bit of a surprise to me.

I mean, you're a bee!



BARRY:

I am. And I'm not supposed

to be doing this,

(Pointing to the living room where Ken tried to kill him last night)

but they were all trying to kill me.

 :

And if it wasn't for you...

 :

I had to thank you.

It's just how I was raised.

(Vanessa stabs her hand with a fork to test whether she's dreaming or not)

 :

That was a little weird.

VANESSA:

\- I'm talking with a bee.

BARRY:

\- Yeah.

VANESSA:

I'm talking to a bee.

And the bee is talking to me!

BARRY:

I just want to say I'm grateful.

I'll leave now.

(Barry turns to leave)

VANESSA:

\- Wait! How did you learn to do that?

BARRY:

(Flying back)

\- What?

VANESSA:

The talking...thing.

BARRY:



Same way you did, I guess.

""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.

VANESSA:

\- That's very funny.

BARRY:

\- Yeah.

 :

Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,

we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

 :

Anyway...

VANESSA:

Can I...

 :

...get you something?

BARRY:

\- Like what?

VANESSA:

I don't know. I mean...

I don't know. Coffee?

BARRY:

I don't want to put you out.

VANESSA:

It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

 :

\- It's just coffee.

BARRY:

\- I hate to impose.

(Vanessa starts making coffee)

VANESSA:

\- Don't be ridiculous!



BARRY:

\- Actually, I would love a cup.

VANESSA:

Hey, you want rum cake?

BARRY:

\- I shouldn't.

VANESSA:

\- Have some.

BARRY:

\- No, I can't.

VANESSA:

\- Come on!

BARRY:

I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

VANESSA:

\- Where?

BARRY:

\- These stripes don't help.

VANESSA:

You look great!

BARRY:

I don't know if you know

anything about fashion.

 :

Are you all right?

VANESSA:

(Pouring coffee on the floor and missing the cup completely)

No.

(Flash forward in time. Barry and Vanessa are sitting together at a table

on top of the apartment building drinking coffee)



 :

BARRY==

He's making the tie in the cab

as they're flying up Madison.

 :

He finally gets there.

 :

He runs up the steps into the church.

The wedding is on.

 :

And he says, ""Watermelon?

I thought you said Guatemalan.

 :

Why would I marry a watermelon?""

(Barry laughs but Vanessa looks confused)

VANESSA:

Is that a bee joke?

BARRY:

That's the kind of stuff we do.

VANESSA:

Yeah, different.

 :

So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

(Barry stands on top of a sugar cube floating in his coffee and paddles it

around with a straw like it's a gondola)

BARRY:

About work? I don't know.

 :

I want to do my part for the hive,

but I can't do it the way they want.

VANESSA:

I know how you feel.



BARRY:

\- You do?

VANESSA:

\- Sure.

 :

My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or

a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

BARRY:

\- Really?

VANESSA:

\- My only interest is flowers.

BARRY:

Our new queen was just elected

with that same campaign slogan.

 :

Anyway, if you look...

(Barry points to a tree in the middle of Central Park)

 :

There's my hive right there. See it?

VANESSA:

You're in Sheep Meadow!

BARRY:

Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

VANESSA:

No way! I know that area.

I lost a toe ring there once.

BARRY:

\- Why do girls put rings on their toes?

VANESSA:

\- Why not?

BARRY:



\- It's like putting a hat on your knee.

VANESSA:

\- Maybe I'll try that.

(A custodian installing a lightbulb looks over at them but to his

perspective it looks like Vanessa is talking to a cup of coffee on the

table)

CUSTODIAN:

\- You all right, ma'am?

VANESSA:

\- Oh, yeah. Fine.

 :

Just having two cups of coffee!

BARRY:

Anyway, this has been great.

Thanks for the coffee.

VANESSA==

Yeah, it's no trouble.

BARRY:

Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,

I'd be up the rest of my life.

(Barry points towards the rum cake)

 :

Can I take a piece of this with me?

VANESSA:

Sure! Here, have a crumb.

(Vanessa hands Barry a crumb but it is still pretty big for Barry)

BARRY:

\- Thanks!

VANESSA:

\- Yeah.

BARRY:

All right. Well, then...

I guess I'll see you around.



 :

Or not.

VANESSA:

OK, Barry...

BARRY:

And thank you

so much again... for before.

VANESSA:

Oh, that? That was nothing.

BARRY:

Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

(Vanessa and Barry hold hands, but Vanessa has to hold out a finger because

her hands is to big and Barry holds that)

(The custodian looks over again and it appears Vanessa is laughing at her

coffee again. The lightbulb that he was screwing in sparks and he falls off

the ladder)

(Fast forward in time and we see two Bee Scientists testing out a parachute

in a Honex wind tunnel)

BEE SCIENTIST #1:

This can't possibly work.

BEE SCIENTIST #2:

He's all set to go.

We may as well try it.

 :

OK, Dave, pull the chute.

(Dave pulls the chute and the wind slams him against the wall and he falls

on his face.The camera pans over and we see Barry and Adam walking

together)

ADAM:

\- Sounds amazing.

BARRY:

\- It was amazing!

 :

It was the scariest,

happiest moment of my life.



ADAM:

Humans! I can't believe

you were with humans!

 :

Giant, scary humans!

What were they like?

BARRY:

Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

 :

They eat crazy giant things.

They drive crazy.

ADAM:

\- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?

BARRY:

\- Some of them. But some of them don't.

ADAM:

\- How'd you get back?

BARRY:

\- Poodle.

ADAM:

You did it, and I'm glad. You saw

whatever you wanted to see.

 :

You had your ""experience."" Now you

can pick out your job and be normal.

BARRY:

\- Well...

ADAM:

\- Well?

BARRY:

Well, I met someone.



ADAM:

You did? Was she Bee-ish?

 :

\- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!

BARRY:

\- No, no, no, not a wasp.

ADAM:

\- Spider?

BARRY:

\- I'm not attracted to spiders.

 :

I know, for everyone else, it's the hottest thing,

with the eight legs and all.

 :

I can't get by that face.

ADAM:

So who is she?

BARRY:

She's... human.

ADAM:

No, no. That's a bee law.

You wouldn't break a bee law.

BARRY:

\- Her name's Vanessa.

(Adam puts his head in his hands)

ADAM:

\- Oh, boy.

BARRY==

She's so nice. And she's a florist!

ADAM:

Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!



BARRY:

We're not dating.

ADAM:

You're flying outside the hive, talking

to humans that attack our homes

 :

with power washers and M-80s!

That's one-eighth a stick of dynamite!

BARRY:

She saved my life!

And she understands me.

ADAM:

This is over!

BARRY:

Eat this.

(Barry gives Adam a piece of the crumb that he got from Vanessa. Adam eats

it)

ADAM:

(Adam's tone changes)

This is not over! What was that?

BARRY:

\- They call it a crumb.

ADAM:

\- It was so stingin' stripey!

BARRY:

And that's not what they eat.

That's what falls off what they eat!

 :

\- You know what a Cinnabon is?

ADAM:

\- No.

(Adam opens a door behind him and he pulls Barry in)



BARRY:

It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.

ADAM:

Be quiet!

BARRY:

They heat it up...

ADAM:

Sit down!

(Adam forces Barry to sit down)

BARRY:

(Still rambling about Cinnabons)

...really hot!

(Adam grabs Barry by the shoulders)

ADAM:

\- Listen to me!

pink smoke from the plane, but on the last loop-the-loop she suddenly

crashes into a mountain and the plane explodes. The destroyed plane falls

into some rocks and explodes a second time)

BARRY:

Vanessa!

discovering that he was just day dreaming. He slowly sinks back into the

\- I told you not to yell at him.

He doesn't respond to yelling!

MARTIN:

\- Then why yell at me?

**My profile:** M38, AuADD + OCPD, aphantasia (4/5), alexithymia

**Goal:** to be as productive as I was a few months ago with Ritalin.

I wonder if you can give me some hints or share your experience. Is there some technique that I didn't possibly try out?

**Medication**: controlled release *MPH*, nowadays circa 40mg daily. In the first couple of month my focus was laser-sharp, I could get sooo much done during a single day, but now after half a year the honeymoon period is over.

Increasing my MPH dosage causes heart and blood pressure problems, anxiety, **and increases adhd symptoms**. NOT taking my MPH is a bad experience, because it causes forgetting words, DOH (dropping objects from hands), plus it reminds me of who I was before.

Elvanse is not available in my country, the only available medication in my place is *metylophenidate* and *atomoxetine*. I didn't try *atomoxetine* yet, but I heard more negative opinions about it than positive ones.

**Diet**: dates eaten daily prevent potassium deficiency (e.g. it shows up as muscle spasms and arrhythmia), green tea (oolong) helps to wake up in the morning

**Therapy**: I tried it, I didn't like it and I felt it does nothing. Expensive. I think my therapist (CBT method) didn't specialize well in neurodivergent people). She said sometimes controversial statements like ""*cbt therapy will help you to live without medication*"". The facts that I have trauma, perfectionism, lack of understanding emotions, ... - I already know this. Some of the psychological traps I even like - they help me to be more ambitious. I just want to be more efficient in life.

**ADHD coaching**: Didn't work for me. Expensive. Lot of talking, all leads to just knowing that **80% of success is to just start**, and remembering to go back to task within 5 seconds of an intrusive thought (example - ""*hey, remember that stock in your portfolio? open a new tab, check the price*"") :)

**Neurobeats (music for adhd)** \- it very often does magic short term, sometimes there are days when it doesn't work.

**Sleep**: a good night's sleep controlled by Sleep cycle app helps to prevent side effects of MPH. Sleeping less just to catch-up with tasks is simply not worth it long term.

**Supplementation**: it was one of my best findings this year, I feel it ""cooperates"" with MPH very well. I'm blending milk, bio 100% raw cacao, mushroom ""not coffee"", no-tropic natural supplements (with, *inter alias*, rhodiola, lion's mane, ashwaganda, bacopa, etc.), and fish collagen (for problems with my joints and knees).

**Pomodorro technique**: Does nothing - I sabotage it easily.

**Blocking fun websites on computer/router**: Doesn't make much sense long term, it would also angry my partner.

**Meditation:** does nothing long term

**Change of attitude**: I found that not giving a crap and not trying to save the world helps a lot. A healthy portion of ego, to remind myself that I'm a survivor, not a ""chosen one"" and a savior.",5,1731848512.0,AutisticWithADHD,1,0.86,False

I also have a pretty intense anxiety disorder which often leads me to be very suspicious of people and their intentions, even if in most instances it's unfounded.

One of our new hires of the current semester has from the beginning seems to have taken a kind od interest in me in a way which I find hard to describe, but makes me feel borderline uncomfortable. We don't interact much (she works in a different office) but when we do our interactions have all left me a bit unsettled. I'll list them below to the best of my memory. 

1. The first time we met she knew my name and started asking me direct questions about my job such as how many classes I have.

2. When I arrived for a flag-raising ceremony, she asked me what I was doing there. The same happened when I went to observe our sports day this past weekend.

3. However, when I wasn't present for a flag raising ceremony one day (I was writing a test for my PGCE and my absence was cleared by the school), she sent me a WeChat asking me where I was and whether I was ill.

4.  I make my own coffee at school and have a french press and container of ground coffee on my desk. I was in the middle of brewing myself a cup when she entered the office to talk to another teacher. She saw my french press and asked me about it. I explained I was making myself coffee. Without warning, she bowed down to the french press to sniff it and left without another word. This was by far the interaction I was weirded out by the most.

To be clear these interactions have been very sporadic and I don't feel the need to bring this up with the principal. I just want to know why I feel so unsettled by these interactions. It feels targeted in a way I can't explain.

I had a pizza, a machiato, and a hot chocolate on the house and every one of them was close to perfect. Ravi takes tremendous pride in the food they serve and it shows.

NO.

They can definitely lay on a mat on the floor with toys for 10 minutes if they aren't screaming so you can drink a hot coffee and read a book. Certainly they can watch TV if you're mental exhausted and just need peace. Absolutely, please, ask for medication if that's going to be the thing that regulates you.

Im going to order from manhattan coffee roasters and would like to ask which beans you guys advice for my taste.  I ordered there once before and this was my impression:

Shoondhisa: I really don't like the taste. Had a hard time finishing the bag. Later I ordered beans from another roaster with a similar tsste, but they had completely different tasting notes on the package. I found out that they were both from the "" guji"" region in Ethiopia. Perhaps I just dont like that bean ?

El vergel decaf: best decaf I ever had, but compared to other coffees 6/10

Panela sticky: my favourite non gesha bean that ive had so far. 

Which beans of manhattan do you guys think would be enjoyable for me knowing that panela sticky is my favourite bean and my other favourite beans are mostly gesha's from colombia?

>Hello everyone! The [proposal for improving the backend for Kaspa's explorer and API](https://discord.com/channels/599153230659846165/957648861491515433/1307298974704730162) has received [positive voting results](https://discord.com/channels/599153230659846165/935851925608472617/1306911367558725673), and therefore, fundraising for its implementation is hereby announced.

>**The donation address** belonging to the Kaspa Public Dev Fund wallet, controlled by the `Treasurers`, is:

>`kaspa:pqg2zvuh0nt7kthk8tvwkgjd6vj369r2ul6c0n7gf0w8j6nqwlre2rt8aps0k`

>([see its balance](https://explorer.kaspa.org/addresses/kaspa:pqg2zvuh0nt7kthk8tvwkgjd6vj369r2ul6c0n7gf0w8j6nqwlre2rt8aps0k?page=1))

>**Collection goal:** 200 000 Kas.

>**Deadline:** prior to 10 BPS hardfork.

>The funds raised will be paid to the implementer, `supertypo`, according to the terms of his proposal, namely after the job is completed and the source code is released under permissive license.

>I believe we all understand how important the uninterrupted and really fast operation of Kaspa's public infrastructure is. It determines how easy and convenient it will be for external (web and application) developers and users to interact with Kaspa without delving into the details of direct communication with the nodes, and how this experience will match the speed of the Kaspa network itself, showcasing its strengths and unique qualities.

>Kaspa's public infrastructure is the technological foundation for the positive experience that we all want people entering the Kaspa ecosystem, using it, and expanding its capabilities to have.

Here's the initial proposal text:

>Funding request for development of open source high speed Kaspa indexer (sorry for the wall of text)

>**Background:**

>Indexers are used to store relevant data like blocks, transactions, addresses, etc. for the purpose of supporting a high volume of queries per second, it also needs to keep track of acceptance data (accepted/rejected transactions), also during reorgs.

>As opposed to a Kaspad archival node the indexer enables many types of queries not possible against the node directly with a much smaller storage footprint. Indexers are therefore a very essential part of the ecosystem.

>Back in early '22 a Python-based indexer (kaspa-db-filler) was developed and it has been widely use by the explorers, exchanges and other integrators. I myself took part in hosting the explorer/api.kaspa.org (which also is widely used by those integrators who don't have the capacity to host their own) from mid '22 until this day, which is why I got interested in this topic.

>**Problem:**

>As we all know the Kaspa BlockDAG already operates at high speed with the capability of processing close to 300tx/s. It has been evident for some time that the existing indexer didn't have much capacity to spare with keeping up on moderate rented hardware even at low throughput (<10 tx/s).

>During recent peak KRC-20 use this resulted in all instances of the old indexer falling behind, some as far as requiring resync from archival nodes to get back up to speed after the dust settled. This caused many exchanges and other integrators to suspend operations against Kaspa for quite some time. Soon Kaspa will transition to supporting a blistering 10bps (\~3000tx/s), which will render the old indexer completely unusable.

>**Solution:**

>Earlier this year I started work on a new Rust-based indexer with the goal to remove any possible bottleneck in the indexer itself to allow inserts to happen as fast as the database can manage. I also started work on optimizing the database schema layout to make it as compact and efficient as possible while supporting the new multi-threaded indexer.

>Lots of work has already been done and a working implementation of it has been deployed to explorer/api.kaspa.org since early summer, this had the effect of successfully keeping the explorers up to speed while the BlockDAG was operating at full capacity, using only relatively cheap rented servers. It also helped to slash the storage size on disk nearly in half (without removing anything). The complete explorer database with all history currently occupies only \~300GB. Currently the new indexer is already on the order of 10-20 times faster than the old, and after the earlier mentioned problems some integrators have also migrated to it successfully.

>**Delivery:**

>1. In accordance with the Kaspa ethos of decentralization, continue work on further improvements to the new Rust indexer and schema layout to get the specs for running a 10bps Kaspa explorer/api as low as possible.  
2. Neccessary adaptations to the kaspa-rest-server (api server) to support schema changes.

>3. Migration scripts to convert existing databases to new schema.

>4. Release indexer as open source under a permissive license (ISC).

>A binary-only beta version of the work so far is available here: [https://hub.docker.com/r/supertypo/kaspa-db-filler-ng](https://hub.docker.com/r/supertypo/kaspa-db-filler-ng)

>**Payment:** 200,000 KAS

>As many hundreds of hours of work has already gone into it, the funding will both be for work done and work remaining. Funds to be release when pt. 4 is completed. Targeting to be done well ahead of Kaspa 10bps HF. Funds are to be managed by the`@Treasurers` until then.

I hope you guys will share a small part of your Kaspa for this task. As you remember, Kaspa is a project with a fair launch, without a premine, where all initiatives are funded through donations. This one is no exception, and the high-speed operation of the public infrastructure is extremely important for the adequate perception of Kaspa speed by its users, existing and potential.

And, of course, as always: every donated coin is important. Do not think in the key of ""well, what can my 10 Kas do"". If 20k people from this subreddit chip in 10 Kas each — and that's less than $1.50, the cost of a cup of coffee from a street vending machine — we will raise the required amount in one go.",11,1731846736.0,kaspa,3,1.0,False
1gtcj3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestine/comments/1gtcj3a/the_myth_of_was_there_palestine_and_palestinians/,"The myth of ""Was there Palestine and Palestinians before 1948?"" (part1)","From Zionism’s conception to the present day, Zionists have perpetuated the **myth** that the world’s most vital land bridge (Palestine) was barren and destitute for two millennia before being developed by Israeli Jews.

This delusory sentiment was adopted to enable the usurpation and suppression of the **indigenous Palestinian nation** of its political, economic, and human rights.

https://preview.redd.it/o1uexn78wf1e1.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=40cf9b139e0454fcea75c56cfe002b903a214482

To disseminate this falsehood, Zionists coined the following slogan to entice European Jews to immigrate to **Palestine**:

>**“A land without a people for a people without a land”**

Had the Zionist leadership acknowledged the presence of an indigenous population, they would have been **compelled** to explain how they intended to displace them. Additionally, if one asserts that Palestine was a land without people waiting for the people without a land, then the **Palestinians are deprived of any justification for self-defense.** All of their efforts to **retain their land** became baseless violent acts against Zionist settler colonialists who claimed to be the land’s legitimate owners.

This slogan endures because it was never intended to be literal, but rather **colonial and ideological.** This phrase is another way of expressing the concept of **Terra Nullius,** which translates as **""nobody's land.""** This concept, in one form or another, played a critical role in **legitimizing the erasure of the indigenous population** in virtually every settler colony and establishing the 'legal' and 'moral' justification for **seizing native land.** According to this principle, any lands that were **not** managed in a 'modern' manner were considered **vacant by colonists** and thus **available for acquisition.** In essence, yes, there are people there, but **none** of them were **significant or worth considering.**

This becomes abundantly clear when reading the writings of early Zionists such as Chaim Weizmann, who responded to a question about Palestine's inhabitants with:

>“The British told us that there are there some hundred thousands **negroes** \[Kushim\] and for those there is **no value**.”. (Nur masalha, Expulsion of the Palestinians, P. 6).

The quote above shows the influence of the **racist European colonial rhetoric.** This **mentality** would become **the bedrock of Zionism's political and colonial aspirations.** This is why there is an emphasis in the Zionist narrative of how supposedly “barren” and “backwards” Palestine was before their arrival. An embodiment of *“Making the desert bloom myth”* that is unraveled in the next section. The whole message of such **myths and distortions** is: *We deserve the land more than the indigenous people; they have done nothing with it; we can revitalize it.*

When the first Zionist settlers came to Palestine in **1882**, the land was **not empty.** This fact was recognized by Zionist leaders long before the arrival of the first Jewish settlers.

A Zionist delegation was sent to Palestine to assess the feasibility of settling the land with persecuted European Jews. They reported back to their colleagues from Palestine:

>**“The bride is beautiful, but she is married to another man.”** \*(Avi Shlaim, Iron Wall, p. 3.)\*and *(Ilan Pappe, Ten Myths about Israel, p. 41.)*.

Although many Zionists were knowledgeable of this happy marriage as early as the late nineteenth century, they decided to **end it** because they believe Jewish rights are more important than the **rights of indigenous Palestinians.**

Following his visit in **1891**, Asher Ginsburg (Ahad Ha’am), a Russian Jewish thinker, wrote an article titled *“Truth from the Land of Israel,”* in which he revealed:

>*“From abroad, we are accustomed to believing that Eretz Israel is presently almost totally desolate, an uncultivated desert, and that anyone wishing to buy land there can come and buy all he wants. But in truth it* *is not* *so. In the entire land, it is hard to find* ***tillable land that is not already tilled.*** *… From abroad we are accustomed to believing that* ***the Arabs*** *are all* ***desert savages,*** *like* ***donkeys***\*, who neither\* ***see nor understand*** *what goes on around them. But this is a big mistake…The Arabs, and especially those in the cities,* ***understand our deeds*** *and our* ***desires*** *in Eretz Israel, but they keep quiet and pretend not to understand, since they do not see our present activities as a threat to their future. … However, if the time comes when the life of our people in Eretz Israel develops to the point of encroaching upon the* ***native population***\*, they will not easily yield their\* ***place…***

He describes how he witnessed Jews treating Arabs in the same article and warns his audience of the **repercussions:**

>*“Instead of treating the* ***local population*** *with* ***love and respect…justice and righteousness***\*, the settlers, having been oppressed in their countries of origin, have suddenly become\* ***masters*** *and have begun* ***behaving*** *accordingly.”*

>*“This sudden change has engendered in them an impulse to* ***despotism*** *… and behold, they walk with the Arabs in* ***hostility and cruelty, unjustly encroaching on them, shamefully beating them for no good reason***\*, and even\* ***bragging*** *about what they do, and there is* ***no one*** *to stand in the breach and call a halt to this* ***dangerous and despicable impulse.*** *To be sure, our people are correct in saying that the Arab respects only those who demonstrate strength and courage,* ***but*** *this is relevant only when he feels that his rival is acting* ***JUSTLY***\*; it is not the case if there is reason to think his rival’s actions are\* ***oppressive and unjust.*** *Then, even if he* ***restrains*** *himself and remains silent forever, the rage will remain in his heart, and he is unrivaled in taking vengeance and bearing a grudge.”*

Thus, while the settlers were drawn to Palestine as a result of their **oppression in Europe** and saw settlement as a means of self-liberation, they were **insensitive to the aspirations of the indigenous Palestinians.** Palestinians were **not** a part of their vision; they were an **obstacle** to it.

The following questions beg to be asked:

>***Is it true that two wrongs make a right?***

>***Is it acceptable to rectify an injustice by committing another?***

>***If Palestinian injustice becomes greater than Jewish injustice at some point, does this justify committing atrocities to resolve their injustice?***

Even before the Second Zionist Congress in **1898, Theodor Herzl** organized a tour of Palestine for student leader Leo Motzkin. **This statement appears in one passage of Motzkin’s report:**

>*“Completely accurate statistics about the number of inhabitants do not presently exist. One must admit that the density of the population* ***does not give*** *the visitor much cause for* ***cheer****. In* ***whole stretches throughout the land,*** *one constantly comes across* ***large Arab villages,*** *and it is an established* ***fact*** *that the* ***most fertile*** *areas of* ***our country*** *are occupied by* ***Arabs****…” (Protocol of the Second Zionist Congress, P. 103.).*

The use of the term **“our” country** about a land already **inhabited** by others is a **great irony**. When Herzl visited Palestine, he demonstrated utter contempt for the **indigenous population.**

**Ernst Pawel** writes:

>*“The account of this visionary’s journey through both past and future is notable for one conspicuous blind spot. As Amos Elan has pointed out, the trip…took him through* ***at least a dozen Arab villages,*** *and in Jaffa itself, Jews formed only 10 percent—some 3,000—of the total population. Yet* ***not once*** *does he refer to the* ***natives*** *in his notes, nor do they ever seem to* ***figure in his later reflections. In*** ***overlooking, in*** ***refusing*** *to acknowledge their* ***presence***\*—and hence their\* ***humanity***\*—he both\* ***followed and reinforced*** ***a*** ***trend*** *that was to have* ***tragic consequences*** *for Jews and Arabs like.”*

**A renowned Palestinian Arab from that era is worth mentioning here: Yusuf Diya al-Din Pasha al-Khalidi**, a well-known Palestinian Arab politician who served as mayor of Jerusalem for several non-consecutive terms in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.*1*

[Yusuf Diya-uddin Pasha al-Khalidi: prominent Ottoman politician who served three times as mayor of Jerusalem](https://preview.redd.it/usl96bvbwf1e1.jpg?width=413&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49ed4e361d2e8958d12f2c6503727f1c6aa252c3)

Yusuf Diya descended from a long line of Muslim scholars and legal officials in Jerusalem. He pursued a different route for himself at a young age. He spent five years in the **1860s** attending some of the region’s first institutions to offer a modern Western-style education. *(Rashid Khalidi, The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine, p. 2.)*

Yusuf Diya served as Jerusalem’s mayor for nearly a decade. He was also elected as a representative from Jerusalem to the Ottoman parliament, which was established in **1876**. Diya earned the enmity of Sultan ‘Abd al-Hamid by advocating for parliamentary prerogatives over executive authority. *2*

The Khalidi Library contains many books of al-Khalidi in French, German, and English. The library also contains correspondence with learned figures in Europe and the Middle East. Additionally, the library’s collection of vintage Austrian, French, and British newspapers demonstrates that Yusuf Diya was an avid reader of the international press.

Yusuf Diya was acutely aware of the pervasiveness of Western anti-Semitism as a result of his extensive reading, his time in Vienna and other European countries, and his encounters with Christian missionaries. He had also amassed an impressive knowledge of Zionism’s intellectual origins, particularly its genesis as a reaction to Christian Europe’s virulent anti-Semitism. He was undoubtedly familiar with The Der Judenstaat, a book published in 1896 by Viennese journalist Theodor Herzl, and with the first two Zionist congresses held in Basel, Switzerland, in 1897 and 1898. *3* (Indeed, it appears as though Yusuf Diya was familiar with Herzl from his own time in Vienna.) He was informed of the debates and positions taken by various Zionist leaders and factions, including Herzl’s explicit call for a Jewish state with the “sovereign right” to control immigration. Additionally, as Jerusalem’s mayor, he witnessed the conflict with the local population that accompanied the early years of proto-Zionist activity, beginning with the arrival of the first European Jewish settlers in the late 1870s and early 1880s. *(Rashid Khalidi, The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine, pp. 3-4.)*

**Herzl**, the acknowledged founder of the burgeoning movement, paid his **one and only visit to Palestine in 1898, timed to coincide with the German Kaiser Wilhelm II’s visit.** He had already begun to consider some of the issues surrounding Palestine’s colonization, writing in his diary **in 1895:**

>*We must* ***expropriate*** *gently the* ***private property*** *on the estates assigned to us. We shall try to* ***spirit*** ***the*** ***penniless population*** *across the border by procuring employment for it in the transit countries, while* ***denying it*** *employment in* ***our*** *own country. The property owners will come over to our side. Both the process of* ***expropriation*** *and the* ***removal of the poor*** *must be carried out* ***discreetly*** ***and*** ***circumspectly.*** *4*

Yusef Diya knew there was **no way** to reconcile Zionism’s claims to Palestine and its goal of Jewish statehood and sovereignty there. **On March 1, 1899**, He sent a prescient seven-page letter to the French chief rabbi, Zadoc Kahn, with the intention of it being forwarded to the founder. *(Rashid Khalidi, The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine, p. 4.)*

The letter began with an expression of Yusuf Diya’s admiration for Herzl, whom he praised *“as a man, as a writer of talent, and as a true Jewish patriot, ”* and of his respect for Judaism and for Jews, who he said were *“our cousins,”* referring to the Patriarch Abraham, revered as their common forefather by both Jews and Muslims. *5*

He understood the motivations for Zionism, just as he deplored the persecution to which Jews were subject in Europe. In light of this, he wrote, Zionism in principle was *“natural, beautiful and just,”* and, *“who could contest the rights of the Jews in Palestine? My God, historically it is your country!”*

**This sentence is occasionally cited in isolation** from the remainder of the letter to demonstrate Yusuf Diya’s enthusiastic support for the entire Zionist scheme in Palestine. However, the former mayor and deputy mayor of Jerusalem proceeded to **warn of the hazards** he foresaw as a consequence of the Zionist project for a sovereign Jewish state in Palestine being implemented. Zionism would sow **discord** among Christians, Muslims, and Jews in Palestine. This would **jeopardize the status and security** enjoyed by Jews throughout the Ottoman domains. Coming to his main purpose, Yusuf Diya said soberly that whatever the merits of Zionism, the *“brutal force of circumstances had to be taken into account.”* The most important of them was that *“Palestine is an integral part of the Ottoman Empire, and more gravely, it* ***is inhabited by others.*** *“Palestine* already had an **indigenous population that would never accept being superseded.** Yusuf Diya spoke” *with full knowledge of the facts,”* asserting that it was *“pure folly”* for Zionism to plan to **take over** Palestine. *“Nothing could be more just and equitable,”* than for *“the unhappy Jewish nation”* to find refuge elsewhere. But he concluded with a heartfelt plea,” *in the name of God, let* **Palestine be left alone.**” *(Rashid Khalidi, The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine, p. 5.)*

**Herzl’s response to Yusuf Diya was prompt, on March 19.** His letter was probably the **first response** by a founder of the Zionist movement to a cogent Palestinian opposition to its embryonic plans for Palestine. In it, Herzl constructed what was to become a **pattern** of dismissing as insignificant the interests, and sometimes the **very existence,** of the indigenous population. The Zionist leader simply **ignored** the letter’s **basic thesis,** that Palestine was already **inhabited by a population unwilling to be displaced.** Although Herzl had visited the country once, he, like most early European Zionists, had little knowledge of or contact with its native inhabitants. He also ignored al-Khalidi’s well-founded concerns about the **danger** the Zionist project would pose to the **Middle East’s** large and well-established **Jewish communities**. *(Rashid Khalidi, The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine, p. 5.)*

By glossing over the fact that Zionism was ultimately intended to result in **Jewish domination of Palestine,** Herzl used a rationale that has been a **cornerstone for colonialists** at all times and in all places, and that would become a **hallmark** of the Zionist movement’s argument: **Jewish immigration would benefit Palestine’s indigenous people.***(Rashid Khalidi, The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine, p. 6.)*

*“It is their well-being, their individual wealth, which we will increase by bringing in our own.”* Echoing the language he had used in Der Judenstaat, Herzl added: *“In allowing immigration to a number of Jews bringing their intelligence, their financial acumen and their means of enterprise to the country, no one can doubt that the well-being of the entire country would be the happy result.” 6*

***Yusuf Diya to Theodore Herzl: Palestine “is inhabited by others” who will not easily accept their own displacement.***

https://preview.redd.it/7fo17fv8xf1e1.jpg?width=431&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecd2ac33ee0e8f609a80a9e8f0a551cfb8b67644

**Most revealingly, the letter addresses an issue that Yusuf Diya had not even raised.**

>*“You see another difficulty, Excellency, in the* ***existence of the non-Jewish population in Palestine.*** *But who would think of sending them* ***away****?”*

With his assurance in response to al-Khalidi’s **unasked question**, Herzl alludes to the desire recorded in his diary to “**spirit**” the country’s poor population “**discreetly**” across the borders.7 It is clear from this chilling quotation that Herzl grasped the importance of “**disappearing**“ the **native** population of Palestine for Zionism to **succeed**. Moreover, the 1901 charter for the Jewish-Ottoman Land Company, which he co-drafted, contains the same doctrine of **evicting Palestinian natives to** ***“other*** *provinces and territories of the Ottoman Empire.” 8*

Although Herzl stressed in his writings that his project was founded on *“the highest tolerance”* with full rights for all, *9* what was meant was **no more** than toleration of any minorities that might remain after the rest had been moved elsewhere.

Herzl underestimated his correspondent. Al-Khalidi’s letter demonstrates that he fully understood that at issue was not the immigration of a limited *“number of Jews”* to Palestine, but rather the **transformation** of the **entire land** into **a Jewish state.** In light of Herzl’s response to him, Yusuf Diya could only have come to one of two conclusions. Either the Zionist leader intended to **deceive** him by disguising the Zionist movement’s true objectives, or Herzl simply did **not** regard Yusuf Diya and the Palestinian Arabs as deserving of **serious consideration.** *(Rashid Khalidi, The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine, pp. 5-7.)*

Instead, with the smug self-assurance so common to nineteenth-century Europeans, Herzl provided the **ludicrous reasoning that the colonization,** and ultimately the “**expropriation**”, of their land by strangers would **profit** the people of that country. Herzl’s thinking and response to Yusuf Diya appear to have been predicated on the premise that Arabs could eventually be bribed or fooled into neglecting what the Zionist movement designed for Palestine. This **arrogant attitude** toward the **intellect**, let alone the **rights of Palestine’s Arab population**, was to be repeated **systematically** by Zionist, British, European, and American leaders in the ensuing years, all the way up to the **present day**. As Yusuf Diya foresaw, the Jewish state ultimately formed by Herzl’s movement would have room for **only one people**: the **Jewish people**; others would be “**spirited away**” or at best tolerated.

**YUSUF DIYA’S LETTER and Herzl’s response** are well-known to historians of the period, but most of them **do not** appear to have given much thought to what was perhaps the first meaningful exchange between **a prominent Palestinian figure and a founder of the Zionist movement**. They have not fully accounted for Herzl’s rationalizations, which laid out, quite plainly, the essentially **colonial nature** of the century-long conflict in Palestine. Nor have they acknowledged al-Khalidi’s arguments, which have been borne out in full since 1899. *(Rashid Khalidi, The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine, p. 8.)*

**In 1905**, at the Zionist Congress convention in Bessel (Switzerland), Yitzhak Epstein 1862-1943, a Palestinian Jew, delivered a lecture on the “Arab question”:

>*“Among the difficult questions connected to the idea of the renaissance of our people on its soil there is one which is equal to all others: the question of our relations with the Arabs. . . . We have FORGOTTEN one small matter: There is in our beloved land* ***an entire nation****, which has occupied it for hundreds of years and has never thought to leave it. . . . We are making a GREAT psychological error with regard to a great, assertive, and jealous people. While we feel a deep love for the land of our forefathers,* ***we forgot that the nation who lives in it today has a sensitive heart and a loving soul.*** *The Arab, like every man, is tied to his* ***native land with strong bonds.”*** *(Benny Morris, Righteous Victims, p. 57.)*.

Michael Bar-Zohar (one of Ben Gurion’s official biographers) openly admitted that it was a **myth** that *“Palestine was an empty land,”* and to a certain degree, he explained how the myth evolved, **he wrote:**

>*“Whatever became of the slogan:* ***A people without a land returns to land without a people?*** *The* ***simple truth*** *was that Palestine was* ***not an empty land,*** *and the Jews were only a* ***small minority*** *of its population. In the days of the empire-building, the Western powers had dismissed* ***natives*** *as an inconsequential factor in determining whether or not to settle a territory with immigrants.* ***Even after the \[1st\] world war, the concept of self-determination. . . . was still reserved exclusively for the developed world.”*** *(Michael Bar-Zohar, pp. 45-46.)*.

**Israel Zangwill,** one of the most ardent Zionists, stated in **1905** that **Palestine was twice as densely populated as the United States.** As he stated:

>*“****Palestine*** *proper has already its inhabitants. The pashalik of Jerusalem is already* ***twice as thickly populated as the United States,*** *having fifty-two souls to the square mile, and* *not* *25% of them Jews …..****\[We\] must be prepared****.. either …to drive out by the* ***sword*** *the \[Arab\] tribes in possession as our forefathers did or to grapple with the problem of a large alien population, mostly Mohammedan and accustomed for centuries to despise us.”* *(Benny Morris, Righteous Victims, p. 140.)*and *(Nur Masalha, Expulsion Of The Palestinians, pp. 7-10.)*.

In describing the following encounter, **Shabtai Teveth (one of Ben-Gurion’s official biographers)** briefly summarized Ben-Gurion’s relations with the Palestinian Arabs, **Teveth stated:**

>*“Four days after the constituent meeting, on October 8,* ***1906****, the ten members of the platform committee met in an* ***Arab hostel in Ramleh. For THREE DAYS*** *they sat on stools debating, and at night they slept on mats. An Arab boy brought them coffee in small cups. They left the hostel only to grab an occasional bite in the marketplace. On the first evening, they stole three hours to tour the marketplace of Ramleh and the ruins of the nearby fortress. Ben-Gurion* ***remarked*** *only on the buildings, ruins, and scenery.* ***He gave no thought to the \[Palestinian\] Arabs, their problems, their social conditions, or their cultural life. Nor had he yet acquainted himself with the Jewish community in Palestine****\[which was* ***mostly non-Zionist Orthodox Jews prior to 1920****\]. In all of Palestine there were \[in 1906\] 700,000 inhabitants, only 55,000 of whom were Jews, and* ***only 550*** *of these were \[Zionists\] pioneers.”* *(BEN-GURION and the Palestinian Arabs, Shabtai Teveth, pp. 9-10.)*.

The **attitude** of **disregard** for the Palestinian people’s political rights was and continues to be the norm among the majority of Zionists.

During the **first decade** of the **20th century,** a sizable proportion of Jews in Palestine **coexisted peacefully** and retained **cultural** affinities **with** city-dwelling **Muslims and Christians.** They were predominantly ultra-Orthodox and **non-Zionist, Mizrahi (eastern) or Sephardic (from Spain),** urban dwellers of Middle Eastern or Mediterranean origin who **frequently spoke Arabic** or Turkish, even if only as a 2nd or 3rd language. Despite the stark religious differences between them and their neighbors, they were **not** foreigners, Europeans, or settlers; they were, saw themselves, and **were seen** as Jews who were part of the **indigenous Muslim-majority** society.*10*

According to Ben-Gurion’s biographer, it’s **not** only that Palestinians were the **majority in their homeland** as early **as 1906**, it also should be noted that:

* The **vast majority** of Palestine’s Jews were not citizens of the country but **guests** from Tsarist Russia.
* The Jews in Palestine were **primarily Orthodox**, accounting for 7.8% of the total population.
* The **majority** of Orthodox Jews at the time were **non-Zionist**. In fact, they were **anti-Zionists**.
* Zionist pioneers were virtually **non-existent** in Palestine in 1906, they constituted **only 1%** of the **total Jewish population** there.

Moshe Smilansky wrote in Hapoel Hatzair in the spring edition of **1908**:

*“Either the Land of Israel belongs in the national sense to those Arabs who settled there in recent years \[before 1908\], and then we have no place there and we must say explicitly: The land of our fathers is lost to us. \[Or\] if the land of Israel belongs to us, the Jewish people, then* ***our national interests come before all else****. . . . it is* ***not*** *possible for* ***one*** *country to serve as the* ***homeland*** *of* ***two*** *peoples.”(Benny Morris, Righteous Victims, p. 57.)*.

Notably, even in **1908**, when the Zionist presence in Palestine was **minuscule**, they continued to refer to the Palestinian people as “**recent immigrants**”.

In March **1911, 150 Palestinian notables** cabled the Turkish parliament to express their opposition to land sales to Zionist Jews. The governor of Jerusalem, Azmi Bey, responded:

>*“We are* ***not xenophobes****; we* ***welcome*** *all strangers. We are* ***not anti-Semites****; we value the economic superiority of the Jews. But no nation, no government could open its arms to groups. . . . aiming to take* ***Palestine*** *from us.”(Benny Morris, Righteous Victims, p. 62.)*.

**In 1913**, the eminent Palestinian historian ‘Aref al-‘Aref published an article forecasting the outcome of implementing Zionism’s policies, which included purchasing land from **absentee** landlords:

>*“\[land sale was enabling\] the Zionists \[to\] gain mastery over our country, village by village, town by town; tomorrow the whole of Jerusalem will be sold and then Palestine in its entirety.”* *(Benny Morris, Righteous Victims, p. 64.)*.

**In 1914, Moshe Sharett**, Israel’s first foreign minister, wrote:

>*We have forgotten that we have* ***not come to an empty land to inherit it****, but we have come to* ***conquer a country from people inhabiting it****, that governs it by the virtue of its language and* ***savage*** *culture ….. Recently there has been appearing in our newspapers the clarification about* *“****the mutual misunderstanding****”* *between us and the Arabs, about “common interests” \[and\] about “the possibility of* ***unity and peace between two fraternal peoples.”****….. \[But\] we must* ***not allow ourselves to be deluded by such illusive hopes*** *….. for if we cease to look upon our land, the Land of Israel, as* ***ours alone*** *and we allow a partner into our estate- all content and meaning will be lost to* ***our enterprise*** *(Benny Morris, Righteous Victims, p. 91)*.

In February **1914**, Ahad Ha’Am stated:

>*” ‘\[the Zionists\] wax angry towards those who remind them that there is still* ***another people*** *in Eretz Yisrael that has been living there and does* ***not intend at all to leave its place.*** *In a future when this* ***ILLUSION*** *will have been torn from their hearts and they will look with open eyes upon the reality as it is, they will certainly understand how* ***important*** *this question is and how great our duty to work for its solution.”* *(UN: The Origins And Evolution Of Palestine Problem, section II)*.

**In 1914, Chaim Weizmann** attempted to lay the groundwork for the realization of Zionism by stating that Palestine is empty and **its original inhabitants have no say in its fate:**

>*“In its initial stage, Zionism was conceived by its pioneers as a movement wholly depending on mechanical factors: there is a country which happens to be called* ***Palestine, a country without people, and, on the other hand, there exists the Jewish people, and it has no country.*** *What else is necessary, then, than to fit the gem into the ring, to unite this people with this country? The owners of the country \[the Ottoman Turks\] must, there for, be persuaded and conceived that this marriage is advantageous, not only for the \[Jewish\] people and for the country, but also for themselves.”* *(Nur Masalha, Expulsion Of The Palestinians, p. 6.)*.

**Ironically, Chaim Weizmann** wrote a description of the **Palestinian people** before the British conquest of Palestine (**The empty country he mentioned previously**):

>*“The* ***rocks*** *of Judea, as* ***obstacles*** *that had to be* ***cleared*** *on a difficult path.”(Nur Masalha, Expulsion Of The Palestinians, p. 17.)*.

**Walter Laqueur (a major Zionist historian)** gave a different perspective on the early Zionist pioneers’ status in **1914** in comparison to the Palestinian population:

>*“The Zionist immigrants, as distinct from established Jewish community \[religious orthodox\], numbered* ***no more*** *than 35,000-40,000 in 1914, of whom* ***only one-third lived in agricultural settlements.*** *While Arab spokesmen protested against Jewish immigration, Jewish observers noted with concern that the annual* ***natural increase of the \[Palestinian\] Arab population*** *was about as big as the total number of Jews who had settled with so much effort and sacrifice on the land over a period of forty years.”* *(Walter Laqueur, A History of Zionism, p. 213)*.

According to **Zionist historian Benny Morris**, speaking about the period **1882-1914:**

>*“The Arabs (Palestinians) sought instinctively to* ***retain*** *the Arab and Muslim character of the region and to* ***maintain*** *their position as its rightful inhabitants; the Zionists sought* ***radically*** *to* ***change*** *the status quo, buy as much land as possible, settle on it, and eventually turn an* ***Arab populated country*** *into* ***a Jewish homeland****.”*

For decades, Zionists attempted to **conceal** their true aspirations out of fear of **angering** authorities and Palestinians. They were, however, certain of their objectives and how they would accomplish them. From the very beginning of the Zionist enterprise, internal correspondence between the olim \[immigrants\] leaves **little room for doubt.**

Most of the early Zionist thinkers, **most** of whom did the majority of their writing in **Europe**, barely mentioned the **fact** that Arabs were living in Palestine. Thus, while these thinkers spoke of establishing a Jewish society in Palestine in which Jews could work and farm, emancipating themselves from shopkeeper middleman positions prevalent in Europe, there was **no vision** for how the land’s **native inhabitants** would fit into that **dream**.

**Herbert Samuel** (a prominent Jewish British official who later became one of the earliest proponents of the Balfour Declaration and the first British Mandate High Commissioner to Palestine in 1920) wrote **in 1915:**

>*“\[A state in which 90,000 or 100,000 Jewish inhabitants \[would rule over\] 400,000 or 500,000 Mohammedans of* ***Arab race****. . . might vanish in series of squalid conflicts with the \[Palestinian\] Arab population.”* *(Benny Morris, Righteous Victims, p. 72.)*.

According to **Justin McCarthy**, Palestine had a population of 350,000 in the **early** nineteenth century and **657,000** Muslim Arabs, **81,000** Christian Arabs, and **59,000** Jews in **1914**, of which **many** were **European** Jews from the **first and second** Aliyah. *(McCarthy, J., 1990. The population of Palestine. 1st ed. New York: Columbia University Press, p. 26.)*

Thus, in **1914**, the Jewish population in Palestine was **less** than **8%** of the total population, and was smaller than the Palestinian Christian Arab population.

The Ottomans stayed in Palestine for four centuries, and their influence is still felt in many ways today. Israel’s legal system, religious court records **(the sijjil)**, land registry **(the tapu)** and architectural treasures all bear witness to the Ottomans’ significance. When the Ottomans came, they discovered a predominantly **Sunni Muslim** and **agricultural society** with a small urban elite that spoke Arabic. **Less than 5%** of the populace was **Jewish,** and between **10% and 15%** were **Christians**. **Yonatan Mendel** states:

*The exact percentage of Jews prior to the rise of Zionism is unknown. However, it probably ranged from* ***2 to 5 percent****.* *According to Ottoman records, a total population of 462,465 resided in* ***1878*** *in what is today Israel/Palestine. Of this number,* ***403,795 (87 percent) were Muslim,*** ***43,659 (10 percent) were Christians*** *and* ***15,011 (3 percent) were Jewish****.* *(Jonathan Mendel, The Creation of Israeli Arabic: Political and Security Considerations in the Making of Arabic Language, p. 188.)*

As evidenced by **Ottoman census records, Palestine** was **densely populated** in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, particularly in **rural areas where agriculture was the primary occupation**.",12,1731846608.0,Palestine,4,1.0,False

I work in one of the most busiest express stores in the city centre , it’s located to many pubs and opposite is a train station so we get pretty bad customers and I do weekends and overtime other days lates . The problem is that our store doesn’t have a permanent till person so the guard has to call someone over and over again from around the store to approve items on the self service and severe customers waiting at the tills . On Saturdays and Fridays lates it gets so busy that I feel like just walking out and go home . I have to manage tills,self service and doing cages at the same time . I take one box out the cage and the guard calls me , I server that customer and as I walk back he calls me again , this gets so annoying . My store is also known for bad shoplifters , yesterday we had about 5 who kept coming back and robbing expensive chocolates and coffee cans . At most we only have 2 staff and one SL and the store is medium/large sized. 

I just wanted to ask if it would be better to switch to a Tesco Extra which is near my house about a 10 min walk . I like working at the express but sometimes it gets over my head and overwhelming . The staff here are very nice as well and I am used to all these shitty customers and shoplifters .  

I don’t get why we don’t get paid extra do to all these things in express stores , we should atleast get paid 14£ for this amount of mental stress , it’s like they’re abusing us . Even the guards get paid 14£ to just watch TikTok’s while standing and keep calling me over and over again for approvals .

1gtcheu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gtcheu/im_the_guy_who_keeps_the_lights_on/,I'm the guy who keeps the lights on,"Ask anybody in the industry and they'll probably disagree with me, but I think there's really two camps: stuff that moves and stuff that doesn't. I did event lighting. Epileptic roving beams over a fog machine? Mechanized glowing set pieces? Rainbow colors? I did the fun stuff. The dynamic stuff. The rest is piddly shit, trying to hawk $80 residential floodlights or convince an office building your 6” recessed cans are slightly different and more better than someone else's identical cans that nobody is ever going to notice anyway.

I'm not big time famous or anything. I had a decent reputation and it's a small field, so I got crew jobs that were beneath me on all star tours, or I got to be the big fish in the small pond being the lighting designer for off-broadway shows and MLM “conferences.”

I had recently come off tour with an artist famous enough to need a pretty large crew but not famous enough to have a properly planned tour. The whole thing was an utter disaster. I don’t know why they went. This person was not prepared to be traveling through the countries they were in. There were power outages, vandalism, theft, even some assaults. The scary kind, not like, drunk people climbing shit and punching each other, which you get at even the best run shows. The expression “the show must go on” is the mantra that everyone in this industry lives by, so I kept things running as best I could, but by the time we were at the end of the tour we didn’t really have any cool effects. It was all I could do to keep the lights on. 

When I got home I was absolutely fed up with splicing wires together because some local vandal sliced up another one of my cables. I resolved my next few gigs were going to be corporate events and rich people's parties. Rich people can be difficult in their own way and I don’t love dealing with them, but there are significantly fewer stabbings or homeless people scalping copper when you’re at a $500,000 wedding at someone's summer estate in Connecticut or whatever. Those events typically get planned more than a year out so I wouldn't land many quickly. Conferences get planned well in advance too, but they always need substitute AV guys. The pay isn’t good… but it is pay. 

But then someone approached me. I got a sort of cryptic email from a colleague introducing a client who had a job for me. The client wanted to meet in person at his house to discuss. I googled the address and it was in the rich part of town. The multimillion dollar home part of town. I was hoping it was a wedding like I wanted, or maybe like a fancy renewal of vows. The guy sounded older on the phone but it could be for his kids.

I pulled up to his house at the appointed time. It was nice. It was old-money nice, not garish at all. Perfect.

I walked up to the door and rang the bell. An older gentleman answered the door 

“You must be Mr. Dones,” he said, shaking my hand. “I’m Eric Bukowski, we spoke on the phone.” 

“Marc is fine, Mr. Bukowski,” I said.

“Sure thing. Come on in,” he said, waving me into a very luxurious sitting room. “Can I offer you anything? Water? Ice tea?”

“I’m good, thanks.”

“So, Marc,” he said. He paused for a moment, fidgeting. We were seated facing each other over a coffee table that cost more than my van. 

I perked up. This was weird. Might not be a real job, but at least it was going to be an interesting conversation. Nobody looks this awkward when hiring a vendor for a party. An orgy? Was I getting invited to an orgy?

“Your colleague Mr. Martin says you’re the right person for the job. He said you’re the man who can keep the lights on.”

“Well, sure,” I said. “I just came back from a tour where we barely had a power grid. But that’s usually not the hard part of the gig. Is this… *event* in a remote location?”

“Power is not an issue. The building is connected to the grid and I have them installing backup generators.” He didn’t say house. He said building. He bought or rented a whole building. A clue? I didn’t know where this was going. Usually orgies were in people’s houses, right?

“Okay,” I said, and I sat back. I’ve found that sometimes that’s the best way to deal with people like this. Let them do the talking. If I peppered him with too many questions he would likely get offended. I am, after all, only “the help” to a rich person.

“I’m not sure how to explain what is going to happen. There is of course, the risk that you laugh in my face and walk out the door. There is also the risk that you laugh behind my back, take the money, and do not take the job seriously, which is unacceptable, as this is a matter of life and death. I had considered leaving you completely in the dark, if you’ll pardon the choice of words, but a man deserves to choose his fate and not be led blindly.”

This was a weird talk. The weirdest talk I’ve ever gotten. As biased as I am towards the importance of my own profession, it’s not life or death. It’s never life or death.

“I’ve settled on a middle course, I think. The equinox will be in a few weeks. I own a property upstate. It’s fairly large and it’s fairly remote. It is connected to the power grid, so you don’t have to worry about that. There are battery banks and backup generators. It is however imperative that we keep the lights on for one hour–”

“Excuse me?” I said. Was this some kind of prank?

“Do you have a question?” he seemed perplexed, as if this was not the part of the talk where he was expecting questions.

“An hour?”

“Yes, one hour. At the time of the vernal equinox.”

“Just the regular lights? There’s no event? You don’t need lighting design?”

“There’s no artistic design needed, no. White lights. Floodlights. You may bring your own and set them up how you wish, in addition to what I’m having installed. They need to be kept on.” 

“For an hour.”

“Is that an issue, Marc?”

I was already composing a scathing email in my head, back to Alvaro, the stupid, smug Spaniard. Thinks he’s better than me? Thinks he’s Leo fucking Villareal? Sending me this childish assignment because he thinks I’m the “right man for the job”?

“No, of course not,” I said. I was still going to take the money, damn Alvaro. “More the opposite. I do more complex stuff and frankly I’m wondering if you need me for this. If you just need to keep them on, maybe you need an electrician. I’m fairly expensive.” I’m not, but I was thinking about what I could get away with. Double my usual fee? Triple?

“Don’t concern yourself about the money,” he said. “We’ll discuss full payment after it’s done, but I will put you on retainer for $250,000 and advance you $25,000 of it today if you agree to take the job.” 

This set alarm bells ringing. That was too much money, first of all, and the rest didn’t make sense. A *retainer*? Discuss payment *after* the fact? I revised my email to Alvaro. It was going to read, “WHAT THE FUCK” all caps, no punctuation.

“Hold on a minute,” I said. “I think I want to know what I’m getting into before I agree to this. And I will need to have my attorney look over anything that’s not my standard contract before I sign.”

Eric smiled at me. “Of course. If I may continue?”

I nodded.

“I need someone who is going to take this seriously. It will not be easy. We– I have reason to believe that this will in fact be very difficult. I had reached out to Alvaro Pérez Martin because he worked on a commission for a friend of mine, and I later saw the installation he did at the embassy. Very technically challenging from what I’m given to understand. And this is going to be a challenging assignment.

“Let me ask you a hypothetical question, if ghosts were real, how would you defend against them?”

“Ghosts? Like… are we talking Casper, or like The Poltergeist?”

“Imagine for a moment there is an entity. It’s invisible. It’s mostly incorporeal. It can pass through people and things. It can for a brief, limited time, interact with objects. Flip switches, knock over plates, that kind of thing. You can’t catch it, any box you put it in, it will glide right through.”

“Well,” I said, thinking deeply. “I suppose at first glance it seems like you can’t.” I paused. “But…” I paused again. “No, I’m pretty sure you can’t.”

Eric laughed. “But you have to try, Marc. You have to try.”

“Well, what do you propose?”

“It’s the simplest but maybe the most costly option. You replace what it breaks. You keep replacing it, even if it keeps breaking it.”

“Why?”

“Because it’s either that or it becomes corporeal and wreaks havoc.”“I don’t think I like where this is going.”

“Let’s say for a minute this entity needs darkness to appear. It reaches the height of its power during the equinox. If it happens during the day, it’s out of luck. If it happens at night…well, moonlight will pose a problem for it. But if it’s overcast, it will be ready and waiting. And remember, it can move things. Small things. What do you think it will do?”

“The lights.”

“Exactly so.”

“So you want me to do what, exactly? It can reach through walls. I don’t think we can stop it from turning them off.”

“It has a very limited ability to physically interact with things. So we build a system with as few points of failure as possible and we bring backups of our backups. No extraneous light switches in the building, for example. Auxiliary power. And you.”

This guy was a lunatic for sure, but there was something kind of flattering about being told you have the kind of reputation where people thought you were able to successfully fight a ghost.

“Okay,” I said. “I’ll do it.”

“This is what I was afraid of,” Eric said. “You don’t believe me.”

“I’m a huge believer,” I said. “I grew up in a haunted house. Things moving the cupboards, weird noises at night. You couldn’t take any photos inside because they would have the ghost in them. Scared my mom nearly to death.”

He shook his head. “For someone in the theater business you’re a terrible actor.”

Ouch.

“What I want to know is, given the criteria I’ve laid out for you here, do you think this is something you are capable of? If you would rather refer me to someone else, I will gladly take your recommendations.”

He was shrewd, this guy. He had me figured out. I took the bait. “I’m capable of it,” I said. “Of course I’m capable of it.” 

\*    \*    \*

And that’s how I found myself delivering a truckload of equipment to an old farmhouse in upstate New York. We had a week before the equinox by that point, which was child’s play for a professional to set up. It was just a bunch of floodlights. Minimal aiming, no controls. I have some basic indoor lights I use for events, but usually I’m at a venue which has its own setup, or I’m doing a wedding where they’re commissioning custom light art chandeliers, or I am renting specialty stuff. So I don’t have a lot of my own equipment. I begged some outdoor lights off a buddy who does architectural lighting. I’m more familiar with the lights used for outdoor shows. Theater lights. But they’re not heavy duty like the architectural stuff which is designed to sit outside in the snow and rain for fifteen years without breaking. If I destroyed them I’d replace them. I had $250,000. Better safe than sorry. I didn’t believe, but I wanted to show up looking like I did believe and that I had prepared.

There was a work crew there to help me set up. They had built a square ring of scaffolding around an otherwise totally innocuous patch of dirt in a mostly gutted barn. It seemed pretty sturdy. They helped hang up the lights and they showed me the various outlets and junction boxes, and where the breaker was. I took care of most of the fixture wiring myself.

It was a ludicrous set up. It was way too many lights and a mishmash besides. The building had some industrial looking lights hanging from chains and some wall packs mounted to the walls. Then you had pretty much every fixture I owned, which was kind of a lot when mounted together. They were spread along the horizontal bars about six feet up. I had debated putting them on the ground but this would allow us to run across the center “stage” if necessary. Holding down the corners were four massive, overpowered, architectural floodlights. I mean, they’re supposed to light an entire building from a hundred feet away. I’m pretty sure you would have gotten a tan trying to sit in the center of them. It was rough to look at when they were all on, even from the outside, so I had the guys bring me some tarps and I closed off the sides with them. 

Eric came down to see the install a couple days before. He nodded with an air of someone who had no idea what they were looking at. Which was fair, even as a professional it didn’t look like anything except a bunch of lights. We had a strategy session that evening. He told me he would be staying in the farmhouse nearby. The work crew would be stationed around the property to tend to anything that needed it. He was very concerned about the power poles coming down.

“I thought you said this thing had a limited ability to move things,” I said. 

“It does. But if you find the correct weak spot it doesn’t take much to destroy something that seems sturdy. Have you ever seen videos of building demolitions? It takes shockingly few explosives to take down a high rise. It’s not going to take much to take down some termite riddled poles.”

I wasn’t sure who to bring, so I settled on Alan, my brother; and Steve, a guy I don’t like that much but is good at what he does. I wanted someone else who knew lighting there. Just in case. And my brother because he could do what he was told and might as well make some money off this deal if anyone was going to. They drove up together the day of. My brother Alan practically leapt out of the pickup truck, before Steve had even come to a complete stop. “That guy is a fucking lunatic,” he said.

“Ugh, yeah, just ignore all the political stuff,” I said. “He didn’t used to be so bad but something happened last year. I don’t know what. I don’t want to hear about it for three hours so I don’t ask.”

“Well we’re just here for a few hours,” Alan said. “And then it’s $250-”

“Shut your mouth,” I said, glancing at Steve.

“...how much is he getting?” 

“$10,000.”

“I mean, it’s not bad for a day’s work,” Alan said.

“Yeah but he’s going to be pissed if he finds out I’m taking a six figure finder’s fee. If he asks I’m making $25 and you’re making $5.”

“Hey! Why am I getting shortchanged?”

“Because it’s imaginary money and you don’t know shit about lights.You’re getting the *actual* money. Quit bitching.”

“Whatever.”

We had another meeting late afternoon with Eric, who impressed upon us the importance of maintaining the lights. He gave us each a walkie talkie and told us which channels to use.

We had hoped the weather might clear, but it was overcast all day. As the sun set the rain started. We retreated into the barn. We had some space heaters and a folding table and chairs. I had my boxes of equipment - cables, quick connectors, spare parts - arranged at strategic intervals around the perimeter of what I was calling the stage out of habit. I turned the lights on and set an alarm on my phone. When it was closer to time I was going to set a timer to ring every ten minutes so we knew how we were progressing through the hour.

We played cards. Alan tried to make small talk but got a little heated with Steve. I told them to both just shut up, so it was a pretty tense game of go fish. 

I was deeply relieved when my alarm went off just before 11:00pm. I did a final check of everything to make sure it was ready to go.

“Ten seconds,” I said. “Everybody ready?”

The clock ticked down, but nothing happened. We sat around for a few minutes, played another hand. My phone chirped at the 10 minute mark.

“Easiest $10k I ever made in my life,” Steve said. 

There was a pop as one of the lights blew.

We all jumped and looked at each other. “A coincidence?” Alan said.

Then another.

“You jinxed it, you *fucking asshole*,” I said. “Everyone to a boom, I’ll take the far wall, Alan you take the closest, Steve, to his left.”

“Holy shit,” Steve called as we ran. “Was this fucker for real?”

It was my cheap lights going, one by one. They’re LEDs so you can see when the current is too high, the color starts to change right before they fail sometimes. I’ve been told it’s something to do with the temperature of semiconductor. Alan, the only reasonable person in our group, had brought his sunglasses. Steve and I were squinting, peering through the tarps. 

“That one’s blue,” Alan said, pointing to one on my side. As I looked it popped and started smoking. Something was overloading the electronics onboard the fixture. A power surge would have affected all the lights, not just one. 

Steve grabbed a fire extinguisher and puffed it at the smoking light.

“Alan, you see any of the other ones going?”

“On Steve’s side, looks like there’s one.”

“Steve, kill the power.” I had wired each bar on its own circuit so you could shut them off or turn them on individually. Steve and Alan were each manning one bar, I was manning two. I had fed the power to two sides from one boom, actually more by coincidence than design. Steve flipped the switch and shut his lights off. Alan’s flicked off a millisecond after. 

“Alan! Your power! Get it on!” I said.

Steve flicked his lights back on as Alan fumbled. “Sorry! I don’t know what happened,” Alan called. “Got it.” His came back on a moment later.

We stood silently for a moment. Pandemonium erupted over the walkie talkies. It sounded like ten people started yelling at once, and then an ear piercing noise that shut everyone up. Eric said into the silence, “We’ve switched to battery backups. One at a time. What’s everyone’s status. Lights?”

“On,” I said.

We listened to the walkie talkies, tense. 

It wasn’t a pole that went, it was a dead tree. It had fallen onto a Jeep with one of the workers in it and hit a power line on the way down. The power was out. A few guys were pulling him out of the car, injured but alive, and a few more were working on getting the power back online, though it seemed to me like that would take longer than an hour. A couple more guys had been dispatched to the generators. There were two groups of two, so four generators total. 

It was quiet for a few minutes. I thought that I didn’t envy the guys outside, who were freezing their nuts off in plastic ponchos in the driving rain. My phone pinged. It had been twenty minutes.

Then things started going wrong.

It was like working a show from hell. Every little thing that could possibly go wrong, did. The quick connectors slipped off somehow, un-splicing the wires. Connectors came loose. Fixtures burned out. Cables shorted. Alan was losing more fixtures than me or Steve, who had more of an intuitive sense about the fixtures, what needed to be done, and when we needed to kill the power. I made sure to never kill both of my bars at once, even if it meant losing a fixture. So far we hadn’t all had a fixture issue at the same time, but I didn’t like the odds of me, Steve, and Alan turning them off all at once by mistake. I was the failsafe. It was happening too fast to really communicate. I was running from side to side trying to diagnose and fix ten fixtures at once. I regretted screwing all the lids on the weatherproof junction boxes. It had seemed safer but I lost precious seconds getting one off to check why one of my bars went down. At one point Alan asked me for more quick connectors because he didn’t know where I had packed them in his box. I grabbed a handful of the little plastic orange things, they look kind of like legos, and I flung them across the stage, scattering them. Alan grabbed one and so did Steve. We worked in grim silence for a little while, and then my phone pinged.

It had been thirty minutes.

The wind was picking up. The barn wasn’t the most weatherproof so it came whistling through every crack. It occurred to me that maybe Eric should have spent more time re-enforcing the structure. But he was right, it didn’t seem like the thing, whatever it was, could do more than little things. It couldn’t smash a whole fixture. But it could wiggle a wire, and apparently that was enough. I was fully on board with *something* causing the failures by this point. This many problems was not due to chance, and it wasn’t due to shoddy workmanship on my part.

With the wind came another problem, though. The roof. There was enough force to knock something loose up there. Or at least, enough force that a little push from our friend could tip things over the edge. Water came sluicing down from somewhere above, hitting the cross beams overhead and running down the walls. The hanging lights went first, the water running down the chains and instantly shorting out the fixtures. The wall packs hung on a little longer but they, too, failed quickly. I was surprised by those. I thought they were weatherproof.

I lost one of my bars next. The whole bar. Probably eight fixtures at that point, as I had been lucky keeping them functioning. “Fuck!” I screamed. The junction box covers, which had seemed like a good idea, and then a bad idea, now seemed like the best idea in the world. Some of the water dripping from the ceiling ran into the junction box I had opened. It was running line voltage. I didn’t dare touch it. I kicked it with the rubber sole of my shoe out of the path of the dripping water.

“Someone has to go to the breaker.” I shouted.

“I’ll do it,” Alan called back. “I’m no good here anyway. Leave my lights on or off?” 

“Off,” I said. “Too much fucking water. Kill the power to number two.”

“On it,” he yelled. His lights went off and I heard his voice over the walkie talkie, “This is lights, water’s gotten into the building and I’m going to the circuit breaker. Can we get someone to fix the roof?”

Eric’s voice crackled back. “We’re having some… issues with the generator. I’ll send someone as soon as I can.”

We switched to the lights channel and Alan let me know when he had switched the breaker. “Number two?” I asked.

“Yep.” 

“You’re sure?”

“Yep.”

“I don’t want to get fried.”

“I’m sure.” 

I gingerly touched the waterlogged junction box. It didn’t kill me. I dumped the water out. I didn’t think it was safe to turn it back on though.

“It worked,” I said.

“Told you.”

Alan came back and turned his lights on after checking for water damage. The wind was howling so it was hard to hear. I said to Alan and Steve over the walkie talkie, “Problems with the generator? I don’t like the sound of that.”

Steve said nervously, “Probably the rain. Hell of a night, huh? Hell of a night.”

My phone pinged. “Forty minutes,” I said. “Almost at the finish line. I’m switching back to the main channel.”

I didn’t like our dwindling numbers. Alan had three fixtures, Steve had five, and I had four. We had started with probably forty. The heavy duty architectural floods, at least, were stalwart. They hadn’t flickered once. I had wired them to their own circuit as well. Mostly because they draw so much power, but I was happy for it now.

The lights flickered. Only briefly, but there was a sound like rushing wind in the dark. Steve screamed. The lights came back on. “Steve, you okay?” I shouted. 

“I’m fine, just spooked is all.”

“Everybody get your flashlights!” I said.

Before I could do as I said, the power went out. We stood in pitch blackness for a brief moment before Eric’s voice came over the walkie talkie, shrill and panicked. “Lights?” he asked. “You there?”

“We’re here,” I said. “We have flashlights.” Alan had flicked his on. It was a dim glow but you could make out shapes of things.

“You have to keep light on the center area. Nothing else matters. Keep light in the center. The generators should be working momentarily.”

Alan had ripped down his tarp and aimed his beam at the center of the stage.

I heard Eric firing off rapid questions about the generator. The guy on the other end was calm but people were shouting in the background so he was hard to hear. “...another ten seconds,” he said, which was all I caught as I turned to grab my flashlight from the box.

“Uhmm…guys?” Alan yelled. The room was pitch black. I turned, but I couldn’t see anything. “The flashlight died,” Alan said, completely unnecessarily. 

I turned back and felt for my box. I couldn’t hear much over the sounds of the storm. I felt like I was deaf and blind. I started to panic. I swung my hand where I thought the box was, but missed, walked forward, hit it with my shin, and had to feel around. Quickly, quickly. I didn’t have time for this. My heart was racing.

“Guys,” Alan screamed, “Do you hear that?”

Over the sound of the rain drumming on the roof and the wind howling, there was a rushing sound like wind, only much closer to us. There was also a low groaning, barely perceptible, and then a series of loud snaps and pops, before a crash. 

I couldn’t find my flashlight. It was right at the top, I knew it was there, but I couldn’t find it. I couldn’t feel it. Everything felt alien and unrecognizable in the dark.

Alan yelled, “Steve, what is it? Steve?” and my panic mounted. If we died mom would hunt me down and kill me a second time for dragging Alan into this. I don’t know what I was thinking when I brought him along. He screamed. In frustration I upended the box. Things came clattering out, I heard some stuff go rolling. And then the lights came back on, but dimly. I snatched the flashlight up and whipped around. 

“Oh my god,” I said. It took me a second to process what I was looking at because it was completely different from only a minute before. Twisted up metal like something gigantic had burst from the ground. The popping noise was the scaffolding giving way under pressure. It had buckled and snapped like it was nothing. Bits of glass and plastic were strewn across the ground between the fixtures. It was carnage. The lights were smashed. All of them.

Some of them were still functioning, although I don’t know how. Two of the floodlights, though one was fading fast, and a couple of the smaller spots that had been on the bars. One was dangling from a cable and spinning slowly in a circle like the world’s worst disco ball, the ruined scaffolding making thin, wavering shadows that danced around. Another was laying on the ground.

I dodged through the twisted scaffold and charged across the space. I slipped and fell pretty hard. A piece of plastic skidded out from under my feet and I went down. I smashed my phone on something.I didn’t see Alan or Steve. I scrambled upright and ran to the other side.

Alan was sitting on the ground, dazed.

“Alan, thank God! What happened to Steve? Did something get him?”

“I think he… left,” Alan said. “He ran, I heard him fall. He got back up and made for the door. I think he was crying.” He pointed. The door was open and slamming against the wall in the wind. The rain was pooling on the floor. “I think it got me,” he said. 

I looked down at his leg and he had a nasty gash on his shin. Maybe down to the bone.

“Fuck. You have to get out of here,” I said. “Mom will never forgive me if she finds out I got you into this. Get to the house, Eric probably has supplies there.” I looked around for something to wrap it with. I grabbed the first aid kit Eric had left for us and pulled out the gauze. I wrapped it around his leg as tight as I could. The bandage bloomed red. It didn’t seem sufficient so I ripped off my shirt and wrapped it around as best I could.

“I don’t think it’s that bad,” Alan said. “I can’t even feel it.”

“Go to the house,” I said. I got him up and shoved him out the door. I think he was sort of in shock because he left me without an argument. I closed the door and latched it.

“Lights?” Eric’s voice came over the walkie talkie.

“I copy,” I said.

“Still on? How’s the situation?”

“Not good, Eric. The lights are on now. But they went out and we couldn’t keep anything on. Something smashed most of them before the generators kicked in.”

“How bad is it?”

“I have two of the small spots and one, maybe two of the big floods. Two flashlights. It’s a mess in here. I sent Alan to you. He’s injured.”

 “Fifteen more minutes,” Eric said. I glanced at my phone. “Think you can hold out?”

“Maybe,” I said.

“Do you need me to send someone?.”

I laughed. “If I can’t keep these lights on I don’t think anyone else here can. No. There’s only a couple. I’ll see if I can’t patch them up. Keep the power on.”

“I will,” Eric said.

I killed the power to the fixture that was dangling first. It was just the cable that was fucked up, but I had brought spares. I patched it up and turned it back on, placing it gingerly on the ground. The other one had a cracked housing. It was running but it probably wouldn’t take much more to kill it. One of the floods was fine, the other had cracked glass and I think some water had gotten into it. It was flickering intermittently and was extremely dim. I didn’t think it was going to last fifteen minutes.

I dug Steve’s flashlight out of his box. He’d never even touched it. He had kept his lights going until we lost all power though, so I had to give him credit for that. My phone beeped at me. Fifty minutes. 

I sat down on the ground near the flickering light. I was tired. Bone deep tired. This had been the longest fifty minutes of my life. I wondered if it was over. 

The flickering light sputtered out and didn’t come back on. I sat up. It might have been natural causes or the thing might have been back and pushing buttons. I stood up. I wasn’t sure what to do if we lost power again, or if all the lights failed. I had the two flashlights which would buy me a few seconds each, but it seemed to be able to fuck with Alan’s. I couldn’t get it back on either, his was totally fried. 

I started to get a crazy idea. It was a bad idea, but I didn’t want to find out what was there, in the dark. It was better than nothing, and I didn’t like the chatter coming over the walkie talkie. 

“Eric?”

“Standby,” he said.

I edged backwards towards the circuit breaker.

The lights flickered.

“Eric!”

“Not now,” he snapped. “Keep the line clear. We’re trying to fix the generator. I know.”

The lights flickered again. Christ.

The lights shut off. “ERIC,” I screamed into the walkie talkie. 

Everything felt like it was in slow motion. I dropped the walkie talkie and glanced at my phone before pulling out the second flashlight, one in each hand. Fifty seven minutes. The seconds ticked by.  It would go for my flashlight when I turned it on, so I wanted to space it out as long as I could, and buy myself as much time as possible, in the hopes they could get the power back up. It was the worst thirty seconds of my life. 

I don’t know if you’ve ever been in the complete pitch black, alone, in an unfamiliar open space, but it would not have been fun even if there was nothing there. I felt incredibly exposed. I backed up until I hit the metal door of the breaker panel. I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to hear the thing in time to turn my light on. I strained my ears, trying to convince myself either that I did or didn’t hear something. I didn’t know which was worse. I didn’t move. I barely even breathed. I willed myself to be able to sense something, anything, in that void. My eyes kept scanning, unable to track anything in the dark. After an eternity of maybe fifteen seconds or so, I heard a sound like wind rushing, though over the storm it was hard to tell. I tensed even more than I already was, something I didn’t know was possible. I waited another couple of seconds before I flicked on the light. 

It… didn’t go all the way. I don’t know how else to describe it. There wasn’t anything in the center of the stage that I could see, but that’s how far my light went before it just…stopped. Something was eating the light. I stood there with the beam trained towards the center of the room trying to make sense of what I was seeing for a few seconds before it vanished. All of a sudden my flashlight was hitting the far wall again. That scared me more. I had been trying to convince myself it was a trick of the light, or that there was just an object in the way, or something. But there wasn’t. There had been something there.

I stood there, numb, my flashlight in my shaking hands. The flashlight started making a weird ticking sound and I can’t describe how it made my skin crawl. The thing was like, in my flashlight. In my hand. Had it passed *through* me?

I tossed it to the ground and it went out. I stood in the dark for a few more seconds before I thought I heard the wind again in the middle of the room. I hesitated on turning on the other flashlight, as it was the last one, but I heard a loud crunching sound. I flicked it on and screamed. Something was there, across the room. It had demolished the lights that were on the floor. It was thrashing in the light, undulating like a leech. It was less like a shadow now and more like a form. It took longer to vanish this time, and less time to kill my flashlight. I was plunged into darkness again.

Eric’s voice chirped from the walkie talkie almost as soon as the flashlight died. “Power’s back on.” People were screaming in the background.

I turned and slapped my hand along the circuit breakers, finding and flicking on circuit number two.

“Lights, you there? Marc, do you copy? There’s thirty seconds left. Get the lights on, not much longer now.”

The junction box that had been full of water crackled to life. There was some arcing, tiny lighting bolts that seared my eyes. I looked away. One of the lights on that bar, that looked shattered beyond repair, flickered to life for a few seconds before burning out. It was a dull glow and short lived, but it was light. And then the live wire, still arcing wildly, started an electrical fire. Everything was wet so it was difficult to burn, but there was a tiny, small flame growing brighter by the second. The acrid smell of melting plastic stung my throat.

I scooped the walkie talkie off the floor.

“There’s light,” I said, coughing.

“Oh thank god,” Eric said.

“The building is on fire.”

“Will it stay on fire for the next ten seconds?”

“I think so.”

We sat in awkward silence for ten seconds.

“It’s safe now,” Eric said. 

“Is it?”

\*    \*    \*

And that’s how I ended up with $500k. I guess that’s what Eric meant by discuss payment after the fact. He asked what I thought was fair, and I said $250k, not understanding what he meant and wanting to keep the full retainer, but he wired me an *additional* $250k. 

Alan was fine. He got stitched up and his leg healed all right, although he’s going to have a gnarly scar to show for it. I gave him $100k. I would have given him all of it if he wanted, especially in exchange for never saying a word to our mother, but that was all he would take. Eric also paid his hospital bills as an apology, so he came out ahead. I gave Steve his $10k. I don’t think he deserved it, but he was threatening to sue me and I didn’t want the $500k thing coming out in court because he would really go ballistic then and maybe even demand more.

As for me, I took a salaried job with a manufacturer. Sales Engineering. Boring, but completely safe. I used the money to top up my woefully underfunded retirement and put a downpayment on a house. All boring stuff, but I felt like I had had enough excitement in my career, and was ready to settle down. I found my first few gray hairs after that night. Getting a girlfriend is also a lot easier when you’re only gone a few days at a time for work and not a few months, and that’s been going well. It’s been a few years since then. 

I’ve been thinking about getting back into theater lighting, just a little. Maybe some college theater productions or something. I miss it. But honestly, being in a dark theater makes me uneasy. I don’t know what happened on the equinox, and I don’t care to. Eric contacted me again the next year, but I turned him down. I don’t know who he got instead, but I assume it went fine without me, as the world hasn’t ended. But it’s possible that thing is out there somewhere, in the dark. I can’t forget how it looked. My one quirk these days, which drives my girlfriend crazy, is that I always sleep with the light on.
