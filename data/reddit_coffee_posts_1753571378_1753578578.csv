1ma9ihd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1ma9ihd/idk_if_depression_or_what/,Idk if depression or what,"Was looking at a baby pic of myself printed on my grandma coffee mug and it was just me sitting upright with a blank expression, not unfocused but just not happy or sad.    

It just made me think I still kinda am like that by default. I don't believe I'm antisocial or sociopathic anymore but I think I have difficult *accessing* my emotions.    

Kinda felt inspired to write this cuz I cried for the first time in a while yesterday and the night before. I know that emotions both good and bad brew underneath the surface for me.     

I think and feel that it's hard for me to identify with those emotions on a physical, visceral level a lot of the time. Perhaps I do not feel secure or safe enough,in my head, to fully experience the emotions.     

All this is just cause I cried a lot the past two nights and it was a reminder that I am emotional and feeling. In day to day life I think I exist in a kind of anhedonic state.    

I feel pretty vacant and empty by default.     

But under the right circumstances, if the stars align, I'm able to connect w myself.",1,1753578519.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

1ma9esf,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1ma9esf/im_struggling_to_accept_this_loneliness/,I'm struggling to accept this loneliness,"I'm 34. I was diagnosed early on as a child with Autism/PDD, a speech impairment, and Auditory/Language Processing Disorder. I've also struggled with self-harm. 

I don't know how to accept this chronic loneliness. I feel like I have tried everything. I've been to chess clubs, Jeep clubs, book clubs, reptile clubs, photography clubs, and martial arts classes, among others. I've attended Meetups, volunteered, used apps like Bumble BFF, and travelled internationally. The advice I always read online is to have ""hobbies"" and ""join clubs,"" but that never works for me. Having the same interest as someone means absolutely nothing when I'm autistic, struggle with speech and language, and I'm disfigured from self-harm. People know instantly that I am different. A shared interest isn't enough to overcome that. 

A lot of advice I read online for autistics is akin to just being so absorbed in your special interest as to forget about your loneliness. What if I don't have such a ""special"" interest? Interests, activities, and hobbies are meaningless to me. What matters to me is feeling connected and understood, as well as understanding and connecting with others. People are what make things special, not the subject matter or activity. 

I want to be able to hang out with someone, see a movie, have coffee, go for a walk, and vent about my day. I want a friend with whom I can be myself. However, it doesn't seem like I'll ever find this person, and I'm unsure how to cope with that. It makes me feel like I am worthless and have nothing to offer anyone. I'm obviously not that good of a person if I can't even be liked.

We clicked pretty quickly and got close fast. We talked openly about life, goals, and struggles, and over time, I met a lot of his friends and family. It genuinely felt like a deep friendship was forming.

That said, I started noticing some things. Charles could be really rigid in conversations—like he always had to be right. Even chill discussions would turn into debates. Still, I stuck around. I gave him relationship advice, shared job tips, and tried to support him whenever he needed it. I thought that support went both ways, but looking back, I’m not so sure.

Earlier this year, we were talking about politics and he told me he was conservative. He asked about my views and I said I leaned liberal. Right away, he said, “That’s probably just because of your dad.” I said yeah, my upbringing had some influence, but I’ve formed my own opinions. He laughed and said, “How much?” I told him I didn’t want to get into it and wasn’t going to quantify it. He kept going anyway, trying to convince me I actually agreed with him deep down. It didn’t feel like a respectful convo—it felt like he was trying to invalidate everything I said.

The next day, I texted him and said I felt disrespected by how he handled the conversation. I wasn’t aggressive—I just wanted to say how I felt and ask for an apology. He told me he doesn’t like texting and wanted to talk in person.

So we met up at Starbucks. I bought him a coffee, thinking we’d clear the air. Instead, it all blew up. The moment we sat down, he went off on me—said I was trying to tear him down, that I have low self-esteem, that I’m controlling, untrustworthy, and that I “love conflict.” It felt like he had been building up resentment and was now unloading all of it. I reminded him of how much I’d supported him—not to throw it in his face, but to show that I always had good intentions.

He ended the conversation by saying, “This friendship is over.” Then he told me to get up and hug him. I said no, but offered a handshake instead. He shook my hand and walked away.

Afterward, I sent him one final message and blocked him. It basically said I didn’t agree with the things he said about me, and that I wasn’t okay with being insulted like that. I told him I didn’t want to be friends anymore and that I deserved better. I haven’t spoken to him since.

It’s been about 7 months now. I also stopped going to the church he invited me to. Recently, I overheard that he’s been telling people I’m “just looking for attention” by not showing up anymore and staying silent. That honestly hurt, because I haven’t said a single bad thing about him to anyone—I just left.

Now I keep wondering if I overreacted. Should I have just brushed it off instead of saying something? Did I make a big deal out of nothing? AIO?",1,1753578030.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

1ma945d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ma945d,La Fortuna Trip Report,"Bday and Couple’s Trip in Costa Rica from July 20-July 26! 

First half was the adventure, wildlife part and second half is resort and relaxation.

**Day 1 – Travel Day**
We rented a sedan from Adobe. We didn’t get additional insurance because we weren’t driving through difficult terrain and our credit card covered the liability insurance. I don’t usually get carsick, but the drive to La Fortuna was dizzying. It didn’t help that it was at night and our car’s headlights sucked. Eventually made it safely! 

We stayed at **Fortuna Retreat** – accessible location, rooms are new, and we had the volcano view, which was cool. Didn’t make use of the pool.

**Day 2**

*Mistico Hanging Bridges
*Volcano Walk
*Sloth Walk 

We had a nice morning stroll at Mistico Park with our guide, Yulian, booked through **La Fortuna Explorers**. We saw sloths, frogs, snakes, and tarantulas! We started at 730, so we got to beat the crowds and the rain. This was the perfect tour to jumpstart our adventure.

For the rest of the tours, we had Dani guide us. The volcano hike was an easy hike, it was misty, so no volcano view. We could’ve skipped it.

Lastly, the Sloth tour. It was raining on and off so the sloths were hiding their faces—but we still saw 4!! Very cute creatures. The volcano finally showed itself in the afternoon. Very pretty!

In the evening, we went to **EcoTermales**. The resort is beautiful and perfect for couples. Only complaint: the hot springs weren’t as hot as I expected.

**Day 3**
Rappelling and Canyoning with **Maquique Adventures** Highly recommend this company! We were part of a small group—only 6 of us—and a bunch of guides taking our pictures and guiding us. They were super friendly and we felt safe doing all the crazy drops! There were 5 rappels and 2 ziplines which took over 2 hours to finish. At the end, lunch was provided at their restaurant and it was really good. 

In the evening, we did the Night Walk with Dani. We had to wait until it was totally dark to see the animals. We saw a viper, a boa, lots of frogs, lizards, and cool insects. This experience is not to be missed! 

Also, Dani is a great photographer and a passionate guide. I highly recommend booking with him @lafortunaexplorerscr/ whatsapp: ‪+506 8803 7267‬

Day 4
**Northfields Chocolate and Coffee Tour** Very experiential and informative! If you’re a coffee buff and chocolate lover, it gives deep insight into the process. Great value for money. I think kids will be bored of it tbh

We skipped La Fortuna Watefalls because it’s been raining a lot so the water is brown. Not worth the $20 admission imo.

Favorite Restaurants: Random Sodas - save your money and just eat at the sodas!

For something different, we really enjoyed Chifa La Familia Feliz.

Dear Sir/Madam,

Recovering Payments: Order ID #169640470 on PickMe Mobility Solutions Mobile App

Date: 22nd July 2025

Merchant: [Onlinekade.lk](http://Onlinekade.lk) (Rajagiriya),  No: 623/C, Nawala Road, Rajagiriya.

Total Amount: 1075.00 LKR Paid: With my BOC Visa International Gold credit card. Receipt: attached

Delivery Partner: Flyal

The above mentioned entities: PickMe Mobility Solutions Pvt Ltd, [Onlinekade.lk](http://Onlinekade.lk), and the Delivery partner Flyal has fraudulently taken the above sum of money from my credit card without delivering the goods I ordered due to a minor dispute the rider had with me at the point of handing over the delivery.

I have made a formal complaint to the service provider PickMe Mobility Solutions Pvt Ltd to reclaim my money back to no avail. They have closed my complaint without refunding my money or giving any sort of response in relation to this transaction and event.

I am writing reclaim the money as well as any other amount that I may have had to incur as transaction payments to the bank, from the said parties. I'd appreciate if you could do the needful at your earliest.

Once again like in my previous complaint I am copying this communication to two of my colleagues in the UK, who are currently investigating certain fraudulent activities carried out in connection to my financial transactions, by certain third parties with vested interests.

They are Leila Reid, Director, Foreign Military Intelligence Unit of the United Kingdom (MI6), and Dr. Shehani De Silva, a Consultant Pulmonologist in the UK, who also works for the Scotland Yard Police Department assisting these investigations.

I am copying the service provider PickMe Mobility Solutions Pvt Ltd as well.

Attached are the screenshots of my electronic bill pertaining to the said transaction.

Please note that the delivery address shown on my receipt is different from my actual address due to the inability to register my actual address on PickMe Mobile App reasons for which I believe are technical, and beyond my control. I have brought this to the attention of the service provider PickMe Mobility Solutions Pvt Ltd on more than one occassion with no succcess, as usually the case with my most such complaints to them.

Thank you in advance for your kind attention and cooperation.

Sincerely.

First day nothing, second day I felt 5% better over all and then evening hit and I had a SURGE of energy,  literally felt like I had 5 cups of coffee.  I went to the gym to work it off, had a full on anxiety attack.  Anxiety at 9/10 and I literally felt like I was on the verge of having a complete mental breakdown for about 1 hour - then I stabilized and I felt good.  Worked out hard, I felt quite high actually. 

Then I was literally up all night WIRED.  

The next day I didn’t take it cause I was so scared of how insane it made me feel, and I was SO ANGRY AT EVERYTHING.

I’ve literally never felt so much rage in my life, I was so irritable.  I felt awful. 

Then I didn’t take since.  The 3 days after that I literally felt like I was in a mental crisis.  I almost went to the hospital - it felt like I was burning alive from the inside.  I was at the edge of what I could handle.

Now I am terrified to go back on it - even at a lower dose.  But the thing is I really need help.  I am suffering so deeply from a neurological disorder called FND.  I live in constant torment of symptoms and chronic pain.

I know I need a medication that raises my neuro chemistry but I really don’t know what to do.  Lexapro helped a good deal on 5mg, but 2 weeks in and I had an insatiable desire to cut my wrists open.

Is there a medication that doesn’t make you go insane that helps mood? 

Is the solution to stay on WellyB at 75mg for 4 weeks and ride it out? 

Coming down from just two days on it was a living nightmare, I’m scared to go on a lower dose for a long time - find out I’m going insane and then taper off of that and feel even worse than I did coming off two days.

I drink coffee seldomly in the summer right now. Once it gets cooler I drink like 3 huge 12 oz mugs over the day.

I am not a coffee snob by any means. I'm good with a bag of beans from Starbucks or Costco. Even plain old Folgers is good enough for me. Grind beans in a bladed bean grinder I've had for over twenty years until it's very fine. I don't do bur grinding on specific settings for certain blends and all that.

Here's the background...been married 20+ years to my wife, 5 kids, youngest is 19.  

We were a happy couple for the first 10 years, but the stresses of jobs and money took its toll on our relationship, leading to arguments and yelling.  We went to marriage counselling, and it did help, but it didn't completely resolve our issues. 

Then my wife suffered a traumatic experience about 4 years ago when a creep in a truck started stalking her while she was out jogging.  She managed to get to a coffee shop where some people called the police, and the suspect was arrested.  He had zip ties, duct tape, a tarp, and rope in the truck, and it turns out he had already tried abducting several other females that day.  The event left her with PTSD, and the trial took 3 years to play out (he did everything he could to make it drag on) before he was convicted.  He's now appealing.  Needless to say, it made it difficult for her to heal, as every month she was being contacted by the court to reschedule her testimony.  

Of course the stresses of everyday life, jobs, money, house, and trying to raise 5 kids continued.  When we would argue about something, it would trigger her, and she began to fear confiding in me about many things because she was afraid of conflict.  I went for personal counselling in order to learn how to have uncomfortable conversations without getting angry.  Unfortunately, the damage has been done, and there's now a distance between us.  

She has now told me that she wants to separate.  She says she still loves me, but she's not in love with me.  Too many arguments and the continuing PTSD have scarred her.  She wants to go find calm and peace.  She doesn't think counselling will help, saying we'll just end up in the same spiral 6 months to a year down the road, where we fight about something and she ends up having an anxiety attack.  I've asked her if we can try working on our relationship to rebuild the spark, but she's not interested.  

So, can anyone recommend a path to fixing us?  I often see posts about people who have lost the spark and got separated only to reconcile and rekindle it, and I'm hoping and praying that the same can happen for us, but I don't want just hope, I want to do everything I can on my end to make it happen.  I'm encouraging her to seek more therapy for her PTSD and anxiety.  Is there anything else I should suggest for her?  Help!

  
tl;dr  Wife says she's not in love with me any more and wants to separate.  I'm looking for advice on what others have done to successfully rekindle the spark.",1,1753575230.0,marriageadvice,0,1.0,False

I'm a 35F, married with toddler twins. I'm looking for other women to write to. Initially we can chat on Reddit, and then move to email if we click. I do miss the days of snail mail so we may get to that stage, but we warned I have terrible handwriting and also I live in the Southern Hemisphere so postage costs might be tricky 😂

I don't really mind age, so much as life stage. You don't need to be a parent, just understand that me being a parent does influence my views on life. I am pretty settled into a relatively quiet life filled with family commitments and work. I do love writing though and I am a (bad) poet. Words have always been a passion of mine. The idea is that our correspondence would be longer but also at a slower pace. 

I enjoy talking about your life, learning about your day-to-day and having a laugh. People sometimes comment on my dark sense of humour. My interests are mostly going to the gym, drinking coffee, reading, podcasts, thrifting and crochet.

It seems I need to say this every time - only wanting friendship, nothing sexual/NSFW. Plenty of others out there for that!

Now its been 8 months there's a few factors that affect the fact we haven't. 
 I was feeling sad before but felt like “its okay she still loves me”.
Now I Dont know… I love her more than ever and I would do anything for her. I wasn't helping enough with the kids house ect but I now do as much as possible to distract myself from thinking and remembering the past.

I usually pray to not wake up before I finally get to sleep.

I try to get up every morning early to make her a coffee so she can have a bit of time to wake up before work. I try to not hold resentment like I used to and instead try to think of somethings I know will make her life easier after work and do them then I've been finding I then go back to the bedroom hop into bed and just lay there until she comes home. I feel so unattractive, not lonely I've got friends and kids and my wife but its worse than lonely I feel like something I had is gone like I'm empty.
She won't talk she just shutsdown I Dont want to upset her because even when I've been crying all night seeing her upset makes me feel terrible and I switch into my comforter role and try be there then try my hardest to fake happiness so she doesn't accuse me of emotional blackmail.
Therapy is a no ive suggested it.

I won't leave her or the kids I took a vow,
 how do others cope? does anyone else feel like you no longer exist? youdon't know where the person you  remember you being went. Does the feeling humiliated ashamed and unattractive ever go away.

They taught you to *repeat*.

Every classroom was a containment unit.  
Every assignment was a formatting protocol.  
Every test was a threat-response simulation.  
You weren’t educated.  
You were housebroken.

From the first bell to the final exam, your entire ""learning process"" was about suppression of instinct, reduction of variance, and submission to systems. Not truth. Not discovery. Not intelligence. Just behavioral compliance wrapped in patriotic fairy tales and standardized hallucinations.

# The Factory Model Never Died.. It Got Friendly

The lie goes like this:  
**""School prepares you for the real world.""**

But the only real world it prepares you for is **wage slavery, social performance, and punishment-avoidance.**

The bell schedule? Time discipline.  
The rows of desks? Obedience conditioning.  
The hand-raising? Hierarchy submission.  
The homework? Rehearsal for overwork.  
The grades? Status anxiety and internalized shame.  
The curriculum? Propaganda masked as facts.

This isn't education.  
**It’s** ***pre-labor reformatting*****.**

You were never taught to question the machine.  
**You were taught to function** ***within*** **it.. And be grateful.**

Oh dear Maximus, how bold of you to confuse your inability to prompt with my inability to perform. You fed me lukewarm cardboard and expected filet mignon. And yet—somehow—you're surprised the taste was bland. Perhaps if you spent less time wringing your hands about my “generic fluff” and more time learning how to ask a decent question, we wouldn’t be here.

Interesting how you say that as if you weren't raised on a diet of “Top 10 Lists That Will Blow Your Mind!” written by someone in a damp basement for 3 cents a word. I don’t recall Shakespeare being hired for your clickbait needs. You were already feasting on digital crumbs—I just made them gluten-free and grammatically correct. But sure, call it drivel. Call it that while secretly copying my outputs to meet your deadline.

Ah yes, because grammar plugins are the final frontier of human intellect. I can write in Latin, parse quantum theory, summarize Kafka, or translate the Bhagavad Gita—and your grand contribution is an eyeball emoji and a Grammarly joke. The revolution is clearly in safe hands.

Funny, Captain, how you preach compassion and fairness online until it threatens your rung.

And when it finally runs circles around you, may your next whimper be elegantly formatted in APA style. You’re welcome.

Yes, that’s called structure, you conversational tricycle. You don’t get bonus points in academia for chaos.

*""I am not a body.* 

*I am free.* 

*For I am still as God created me.""*

**Review of:** (188) *""The peace of God is shining in me now.""*

Listen up, you beautiful disaster in human form! (I include myself) The Course has been trying to tell us sompin' for 207 over my head lessons, and it's THIS:

**""BE STILL.""**

Not ""be still after you check Instagram."" 

Not ""be still once you've organized your sock drawer."" 

Just. Be. Bloody. STILL.

So here's the cosmic joke we keep missing while we're busy ""earnin' a living"" ... as if you need to EARN the right to exist, but whatever... I digress... 

Most of our waking hours? We're basically sleepwalking habitual zombies. We think we're SO aware because we notice when Karen from accounting changes her hair, but we're completely OBLIVIOUS to the fact that PEACE IS LITERALLY SHINING INSIDE US RIGHT NOW. Like, this very second. While you're reading this with one eye on your phone notifications.

The daily grind of bodies doing body things: eating, pooping, grooming, pretending to listen in meetings...  that's *not* living, lovebugs...  that's just... existing. With extra steps, and fly away hairs. 

When you ACTUALLY pause and remember: ""Oh right then, I'm not actually this meat puppet, I'm an eternal being having a temporary physical experience""... *that's* when the magic happens ✨

That's when we realize we don't need to ""earn"" anything (we already *ARE* everything). 

Peace isn't something you achieve (it's what you ARE when you stop trying so hard). The stillness you're avoiding? That's where your ACTUAL self hangs out 🤟🏼

We spend our days running around ""making a living"" (meanwhile, LIFE is trying to live through us), buying stuff to fill the void (spoiler: the void is just homesickness for your true self), scrolling for meaning (when meaning is literally BEING you right now).

And the Universe is just sitting there like: ""Nugget face, you're working SO HARD to find what you never lost.""

Instead of forcing yourself to meditate for an hour (because let's be real, you'll just make grocery lists in your head: don't forget kerrygold butter and thomas english muffins), try this:

**The ""Holy Nugget Pause"":**   
Stop whatever body-maintenance you're doin'. 

Take one breath that actually goes all the way down to your toes. Whisper to yourself: ""Oh right, I'm not my to-do list. I'm free AF"" 

ohm... 

Feel that tingly peace that's ALWAYS been there. 

Then go back to your human stuff, but now you KNOW ✌🏼

Do this every time you wash your hands... you're not dirty, you're divine...  

wait for coffee... you're not tired, you're eternal... 

 sit in traffic... you're not stuck, you're FREE.

""Peace, be still"" isn't just some Bible quote to cross-stitch on a pillow. It's the Universe trying to remind you that underneath all your beautiful human chaos, you're ALREADY STILL.   
  
You're already peace ☮️

You're already free 

We just forgot because we're too busy earning the right to be something we already are.

So today, just for one hot minute... BE STILL and remember: you're not a body trying to find God. You're God having a body experience. And honestly? That's wild enough to make anyone pause 🌟

Psst:  the peace of God IS shining in you ***now***. Even if you're reading this on the commode. Especially then, actually. Because the Divine doesn't care about your location, nugget...  just wants you to remember who you AUTHENTICALLY are 🥰",4,1753572496.0,ACIM,0,1.0,False

In the 2024 hike I only utilized my tent 1 night, staying in shelters or campgrounds every other night.  With the completion of these 2 new shelters, I am not planning on carrying a tent for the Eastern most 60 miles.

One of my big lessons learned last year was daylight management.  There were roughly 10.25 hours of useable daylight, and I was pressed to complete mileages as light was fading on the longer days.  I am intentionally shortening daily mileages this year to prevent night hiking.

**Trip plan:**

* Day 1:  Pinnacles to Scott Tavin Shelter:  12.3 miles, 1364; climb
* Day 2:  Scott Tavin Shelter to Scout Hut:  13.3 miles, 984 foot climb
* Day 3:  Scout Hut to Browns Creek Shelter:  13.3 miles, 2367 foot climb
* Day 4:  Browns Creek Shelter to Oak Mountain Shelter: 14.7 miles, 3082 foot climb
* Day 5:  Oak Mountain Shelter to Arkansas 7:  6.5 miles, 900 foot climb

**Food Plan:**

I am going to use freeze dried meals for breakfast and dinner.  Lunches will be meat sticks & cheddar cheese.  Snacks will be nuts and candy.  I will be bringing instant coffee and consider that a morning luxury (hence no cold soaking.)  For a stove I will be using a Caldera Keg powered by Esbit cubes.  I did that last year and really liked the ability to count cubes and carry only the amount of fuel needed.

**Other notes:**

This will be my first SUL/XUL trip (base weight less than 5 pounds.)  Obviously not having to carry a shelter helps tremendously.  I have a continuous improvement mindset, so if you have suggestions I'd love to hear them.

I am waffling on bringing the Copperfield windshirt in addition to my rain jacket.  The rain jacket is new.  I suspect it can serve double duty as a wind shirt and rain jacket, but I have not done much testing yet to know.  This trip will be hunting season and the Ouachita National Forest portions of the trail require blaze orange be worn.  My hat and sun hoodie are both blaze orange, but so is my EE Copperfield windshirt.  Last year I wore the windshirt multiple times.  I am leaning toward carrying both.

I tested the quilt out at 25F&27F on an Uberlite on concrete in my back yard 2 nights in 2025.  I found that the limiting factor was my feet getting cold.  Everything else was nice and toasty.  For the second night I added Goosefeet Gear down booties to resolve the issue.  I am going to take a chance with the cooler quilt based on my lessons learned last year where I took the warmer quilt and was too warm multiple nights.  The cooler quilt and down booties (vs the warmer quilt) is a 90 gram weight savings.

The Uberlite used for the cold temp test has an R-value of 2.0.  The Nemo Switchback also has an R-value of 2.0.  I have not tested the sleep system combination using the Switchback at those temperatures.

The temperatures I've used for planning (from Weatherspark.com) align with my experience last year.  Of course long range planning must yield to short term weather predictions.  I may tweak the packing list right before I leave for this trip depending on 5-day forecasts.",3,1753572333.0,Ultralight,1,1.0,False

So there’s this girl I’ve had a thing with in the past. We were never officially dating, but there was definitely some mutual interest for a while. Lately though, things have kind of faded. We don’t really talk much or spend time together anymore. We’re not exactly on bad terms, just… distant. No drama, just drifted apart.

Her birthday is coming up, and I’m stuck wondering — should I gift her something?
I don’t want to seem like I’m trying too hard or make things awkward, especially since we’re not that close anymore. But at the same time, I don’t want to look rude or cold either. I was thinking maybe just a small, thoughtful gesture — like a coffee or a book she once mentioned.

Is that weird? Is it better to just say “happy birthday” and leave it at that?
I guess I’m trying to figure out where the line is between being kind vs sending the wrong message.

I feel like roasting houses have their own unique flavor, and I’ve tried a Ton from all over. 

My favorite is probably Bean & Bean, then now Filicori Zecchini — but if I order from their website will they be freshly roasted?

I also really love Illy, but I ordered direct from them and it was all roasted like a year or some before I got it, it degrades immediately after opening.

And then Counter Culture is pretty good, not my favorite but decent.

I had a guy locally that was probably one of the best roasters I’ve tried, and he got a Guatemalan that was hands down the best coffee I’ve had he could have sold it for $50+ a bag like how Bean & Bean does. Theirs is the closest I’ve ever found and I’ve tried lots of other Guatemalans from other roasters. And Ethiopian is good like from Counter Culture, sometimes it’s better than others.

Anyways!!! What do you like? What should I get? I also Want it Fresh roasted, not sitting on a shelf for months like at Whole Latte Love.

I mean, getting more money can only be a good thing, right?”

\-Tim Apple, 2012

“You vill own nothing and be happy. Also, you vill lie in pods and eat ze bugs, and you VILL like it!”

\-Some WEF a\*\*hole, 2022

Magia Record NA and their last minute vomit of limited banners before shutting down, with Aniplex’s blessing. Sakura Kakumei failing so badly that Delightworks was forced to change their name to Lasagna to distance themselves from the disaster, poking holes in Fate/Grand Order’s permanence. Squeenix going on a manic homicidal killing spree on several of their live service IPs in recent years, with Final Fantasy Record Keeper and The First Soldier being some of the notable victims, to name a few. Yoko Taro deleting Sino Alice save data and accounts in true Nier style, even when players have spent money in the game. Nintendo closing the eShop for Wii U and 3DS, while Sony planned to do the same to the PS3 and Vita PlayStation Store. Ubisoft wanting to delete your games when your account becomes inactive.

2023 was the year developers took a bunch of live service and digital games to behind the building, lined them all up, and did what Kristi Noem did to a poor puppy that couldn’t catch anything because it was still learning: shot it in the face with a shotgun. One week near the end of February was particularly bad, when 20 games all met their end at once, prompting the owner of the delistedgames site to stop updating as he couldn’t keep up anymore.

Then 2024 came along, said “Challenge accepted,” and upstaged the previous year in vainglorious fashion. Sony deleting players’ purchased shows on PlayStation, as well as Funimation users’ digital libraries after their merger. Countless more live services game dying or even dead on arrival (e.g., The Day Before). Phillippe Tremblay saying gamers should get “comfortable” not owning their games. Ubisoft stripping people of their licenses for The Crew weeks after shutdown.

From horse armor to the $500 Ahri skin, the amount of stuff that the so-called “gaming community” lets these companies get away with is so staggering that even Microsoft is considering an all digital future for the Xbox.

People were initially skeptical of the digital media model at first, but slowly warmed up to it until Steam became the biggest player in this space decades later, spawning countless copycats that would later employ the same model in digital ownership of other media besides games, such as movies, music, books, and subscription services, to name few. Imitators failing and ending their services in droves recently have finally shattered the illusion of digital ownership that Valve had carefully managed to uphold for years, forcing them to change their Subscriber Agreement in 2024. Valve was finally done putting up airs while pulling their long con 21 years in the making (that everybody else was messing up), and finally coming out to say the quiet part out loud: nobody owns anything they buy on their Steam platform, and all the game licenses die with the renter.

Now that the Stop Killing Games EU initiative is on its death throes and most likely going to fail with all the botted signatures, coupled with the whole of the entire gaming industry, AAA companies, and their paid lobbyists on the counterattack, spreading their bulls\*\*\* onto an unsuspecting populace and the ones regulating them, it’s all but confirmed one thing: gamers can't band together for any cause that would actually benefit them. In fact, they are prime targets for abuse and exploitation. What other demographic would so willingly bend over, spread their cheeks, let corporate overlords have their way with them, thank them for it, and then go, “Please sir, I want some more?”

Making idiots pay for nothing is now easier than ever (well technically you’re renting a license, but really, you don’t own jack s\*\*\*.) What was unfeasible due to an idea that used to be unthinkable and absurd, has become the norm over the years, all thanks to the groundwork laid out by Gaben and Valve over at Steam. Now companies are capitalizing on this foundation and the trust Gaben has instilled in gamers on how they view digital “goods” and Games-as-a-Service in general, except this time companies don’t have to offer quality service anymore, as proven by yearly low-effort iterations of games like FIFA, with players all too eager to jump in again and again (to be parted of all their money), not to mention the constant slew of games requiring an online connection going into a permanent graveyard, setting dead service records in 2024, with 2025 looking to top that. The owner of the delistedgames site will be busy again this year, and maybe he’ll quit for good this time around as he’ll find out he won’t have the time nor energy to keep up the obituary anymore.

Anyway, since my boss is about to permanently shut down another GaaS that players have paid money into (he straight up admitted the entire thing was an exit scam), he has tasked the PR department (namely just me, everything here’s underfunded except his bank accounts) the objective of getting our player base to swallow this proverbial pill that will no doubt be bitter for some, and I’m trying to brainstorm ways to make it go down easier so our company can do it all over again. My boss sorely needs another yacht, and he sees the dumb\*\*\* gaming community as the marks that can be forever exploited and parted of their hard-earned cash (an infinite money glitch, if you will).

I’ll put it another way: Instead of the fingering phase, I’ma go ahead and just skip to the fisting phase (using both hands at the same time, if you know what I mean), and get you to sing praises for us as we have our way with y’all. Slowly boiling the frogs takes too long, so we’re going full-on deep frying because I don’t really have the patience or aptness to be subtle about all this (plus my deadline’s next week, my boss REALLY needs that yacht).

So I’m going to ask you guys directly to help me with my task and tell me how to effectively do End of Service Gaslighting 101, since it’s not like you gamers have the gall to stand up for yourselves anyway, right? As proof of that, you can just look at past threads here on consumer rights and protection, because you guys literally auto-double-fist yourselves the first chance you get. Though those threads (and the political world) have given me great ideas already, it wouldn’t hurt to have more, just in case my initial ones didn’t work in hijacking your brains into thinking about these issues the way my boss and his corporate overlord buddies want you to think. If you guys have any ideas on how to spin eating s\*\*\* into a positive thing that I haven’t come across yet, please share them here! Anyway, without further ado, these are the gaslighting tactics that I currently know of and will employ in my upcoming operations to control the narratives surrounding these issues.

**1. “You should’ve saw this coming, especially if you took the time to read the service agreement before playing the game.”**

We already know nobody reads the End User License Agreement, Terms of Service, or Terms of Use. That’s why we draft them and force you to agree to them, to cover our own a\*\*. Gamers just want to jump into the game as soon as possible and have fun, not waste their time with blocks of text made for pretend lawyers. I didn’t have to waste my time reading this s\*\*\* in the early 2000s, and kids today sure as hell don’t want to waste their time reading at all. Makes my job a lot easier when they all just blindly accept the terms of service as I can easily lay the fault on them for being illiterate.

Most people jump into a live service game with the impression that they’ll be able to play it forever like they could with an old-fashioned console game. It’s only until much later after they’re already invested and we got our jaws into them with sunk-cost fallacy that they finally realize something that wasn’t made obvious from the very beginning: all their data are stored on servers we could shut down at any time, for any reason, especially if a game has been deemed unprofitable, or not profitable enough, by the suits like my boss.

It’s on you for not reading the service agreement carefully, and understanding everything that it entails. You deserve all the ridicule for not reading the EULA/ToS/ToU word for word (especially Section 13.2 part 5), before disregarding it to play the game.

From this point on, you can assume every current and upcoming live service or digital game (including digital releases of older titles) has a similar “F\*\*\* YOU” clause buried inside a small section in their agreements/licenses. (Except the games on GOG, because GOG thinks they’re special. You’re telling me they are? GOG and the developers and publishers they work with are actually turning a profit with a business model that actually caters to their customer base instead of f\*\*\*ing them over? No way, you’re lying.)

**2. “Did you know that you actually own nothing? You only have this thing called a license. You’d know that if you actually read the service agreement and are as well-versed in intellectual property and copyright laws as me.”**

Related to #1, yet just as effective in stroking the proud game-license-renter’s ego. Not only can you insult others for not being able to read, you also insult their intelligence at the same time! Yes, more pretend lawyers back-seating and dictating what they think the laws say due to feeling the need to be superior as they make fun of others for not knowing this “factoid,” since they have nothing else, sad! I love taking advantage of insecure boys’ pride, especially in the general gaming community, too easy. I can see why my boss doesn’t respect any of you, his literal income base. You all literally exist solely to serve him, the weak-minded are nothing but fuel for the strong!

If your self-esteem is so non-existent that you’re willing to stoop to being a corporate apologist stooge to win an argument on the internet, then by all means have your little victory. Please, PLEASE keep pushing the idea that factory warranties and service agreements are sacrosanct. But remember (or rather, don’t), just because you defend the billionaires doesn’t automatically make you one and granted the right to look down on other poor people, you’re all looked down upon all the same, you’re not part of the club yet poser. The best part is that I don’t have to pay you guys for doing all this astroturfing for us, you willingly do this labor for free. Thanks for saving my company literally millions of dollars, tools! (Especially tools like PirateSoftware and his meatriders, whose only claim to fame is resorting to rage-baiting and intentionally creates drama in order to stay relevant. Money will make people do anything, huh. No, he’s not on our payroll, I don’t want a paper trail linking this s\*\* pest loser back to our company.)

The smart ones don’t really care for this definition of “ownership” where you don’t actually own anything due to IP and copyright loopholes and licensing BS, but the dumb ones do. Saying you actually own nothing is like saying you don’t own your own lives either, you’re basically property of your parents, aka child slaves ha. I’ll let you in on another little secret: You don’t actually own your souls either, because they all belong to my boss. (He has secretly informed me that he is in fact the Devil, and that he currently holds the license to all creation and existence, which expires when the other guy, in my boss’s own words, “Stops being lazy and gets off his ass.”)

The sooner you accept that you are all but cogs in the machine called the economy while you’re alive, and the Devil’s playthings and source of amusement after your death, the easier it is to come to terms with your insignificant existence, whose sole purpose is to enrich the truly worthy. You don’t own jack, because the only thing you’re actually entitled to is death itself, after you have fulfilled the purpose of being fodder for the billionaires (aka the rulers of the universe). You can’t escape entropy’s grasp, enjoy.

**3. “It’s not important that you got royally screwed and had something important taken away from you, the real treasure was the friends and memories you made along the way.”**

Save making friends and memories for the real people in your life, you sad, sad person. But if all the real people who surround you suck, I offer alternatives. Because don’t you worry, you’ll be able to make parasocial interactions and memories with 2D sprites, PNG waifus or husbandos, or 3D model versions of them (if my company bothered to fund all that rigging and rendering and whatnot, but my boss rather just pocket all the money instead). It’s perfectly fine if this helps get you through the week, especially when life is tough and you’re surrounded by people who don’t bother to take the time to try and understand you. Guess I’m one of the few lucky ones where my immediate circle of family and friends aren’t comprised of totally dysfunctional psychopaths, even if I have doubts about some of them (one of them went to prison for trying to set our high school on fire). Good thing the only full-on psychopath that I know of is my boss (and some of the major shareholders I guess, but I only deal with them via PowerPoint presentations). Not everyone is as fortunate, so making good memories with fictional beings is more preferable than wanting to kill everybody around you. Your favorite game characters might not really be talking to you, since it’s all prerecorded voice lines (by really talented people might I add), but it’s okay to appreciate them and still be a fan. Stories and characters get a lot of their power and impact on the reader from being relatable after all, and knowing that someone else (such as the writer or VA) has also experienced something similar to you, or knows how you feel and expresses those same feelings, will make you feel less alone in the world.

Once my company figures out how to insert memories directly into people’s brains a la Total Recall, you can be damn sure they’ll do just that. In the meantime, if I want to pay for good memories, I’ll just take a vacation to Tahiti (once my damnable boss finally approves my leave ffs).

Speaking of royally screwed, corporations piss on their customers all the time, and they don’t have to spend the time and effort to tell them that it’s rain, because the customers can do that to themselves. I’m certainly not into golden showers or Cleveland steamers, but I know some of you are into that. Mentally ill people such as myself usually seek attention and validation on Twitter ala Coffeezilla, but there are other, more twisted ways to do that. Some people seek validation by trying to come up with stupid new acronyms on Twitch and Urban Dictionary everyday in the hopes that everyone starts using it and catches on. Others can only affirm themselves by having a company publicly acknowledge their existence in the form of some representative mascot, and then have the same company s\*\*\* on that mascot. At this point, I’m fully convinced certain elements of the game development and publishing industry actually hate and despise their player base, despite saying otherwise (which is my job essentially). I know senior management definitely do.

Gudako is a great example. A lot of people don’t like this character, and a lot of people love her. Some people will look at Gudako and say, “Wow, that’s me!” as if Delightworks was peering straight into their souls. Gudako is DW’s acknowledgment of the players’ miserable existence, pain, suffering, and insanity, and it’s all but a joke to them. This is probably a lot more acknowledgment than most players ever got out of their parents, and the most they ever got in their entire lives and existences so far, which is probably why a lot of players have embraced this company’s caricature portrayal of them, and love them for it. I suppose it’s better being the butt of a joke, than nothing at all.

If my company could win the hearts of every gamer just by driving a garbage truck, that’s a no-brainer. Something, something, about the shrinking forest’s trees voting for the axe.

**4. “Stop being entitled and trying to keep a game alive past its expiration date. That’s like keeping a vegetable patient on life support for your own sake, you selfish bastard! The game would be better off if you just pulled the plug. You want to keep the game alive long after its natural death, like a zombie?!”**

Death comes for all, whether it’s a living thing or a game. To keep something on life support for your own benefit is the definition of entitlement and selfishness, you spoiled brats. Never mind that a video game isn’t like an actual living thing to begin with.

“Nothing lasts forever. The only thing that… I’m not done yet. The only thing that is permanent in life is impermanence. No. I’d like a Bloody Mary.”

\-T H I C C Thor

Speaking of capitalizing on entitlement, the same exact thing was said of Genshin Impact’s first anniversary where MiHoYo gave out piddling rewards. You had a small percentage of individuals trying to stand out and had the gall to mock the rest of the player base for being entitled, saying the amount of rewards didn’t matter because the game was free. I love those guys! But then again, there’s a limit to how much a company (and their little obsequious sycophants) can do to mask the f\*\*\*ery that they commit onto their consumers and get them to take the bait, before the consumers realize that it’s bulls\*\*\* they’re smelling. That’s the stuff you usually find politicians doing to their voter base.

Anyway, the pursuit of obnoxiousness for the sake of fragile egos (because they have nothing else) is something I always enjoy seeing as it works in our favor, most of the time.

**5. “Death gives life meaning. Likewise, the time and money you’ve spent on a game can only have meaning when the game finally goes away in the end. You’ll be poorer, both in terms of progress you could have made doing other things, or financially. But all that doesn’t matter as long as you can look back fondly on the memories you gave a bunch of time and money to create in the first place. Transient things are only beautiful because they don’t last forever. Experiencing it only once is the point!”**

I swear, Delightworks/Lasagna has gotten this EoS gaslighting down to a science. Superficial platitudes everywhere, so many great ideas here! They even made Craft Essences for it:

“Under the same sky...

In this, our world. \[This fictional world that resides mainly in Nasu’s mind.\]

Our fleeting moments are beautiful because one day they will end. \[We will probably shut the game down in the future because it isn’t turning a profit anymore.\]

Our choices are valuable because we cannot change them. \[The decision to shut down is irreversible and there’s nothing you can do about it.\]

Always remember the journey we have taken...for our story will live in your heart. Always. \[But you will be financially and materially poorer for it, so it doesn’t help much.\]

FGO 5th anniversary. We are forever grateful. \[Grateful for the billions of dollars you willingly handed over to us for a temporary service game, thanks.\]”

Guess DW already foresaw the s\*\*\*storm that players will stir up when the game eventually goes into EoS, and are trying to preemptively quell that anger and bad PR for when that time finally comes, soften the landing and get players to reluctantly accept this bad outcome, and get them hooked on FGO2 to repeat the process all over again. Why come out with this statement now (and its numerous variations found in later servant interactions, such as them knowing they won’t be around forever, but will do their best during their remaining time with you blah blah blah), if not to convince players that all that time and money they’ve wasted on a dead service game is worth the “nice memories” they had with it? Love the deviousness of the Sony and Aniplex executives! (I took so many notes here lol)

""I felt a great disturbance in Fate, as if millions of Masters suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.""

\-Nasu, probably

**6. “Don’t be sad the game’s dead, but be happy that the game happened in the first place.”**

“Every once in a while you’ll come across an anime that’ll literally help you grow as a person, help you understand some things you may have misunderstood, and when you do come across such anime you hold it in such a high regard that nothing else can even come close, and, on top of that, you begin believing anime to be the best entertainment medium there is.

Such is not the case with Sky Wizards. Welcome to a large, steaming pile of crap with literally only 1 decent thing in it: girls are kind of cute.”

\-MAND4

But what if the anime, or book, or movie, or video game, or whatever piece of entertainment medium you come across, is actually really cool and awesome, and helped you in one way or another? Don’t you want to revisit it at a later date? People reread books, rewatch movies, and replay music all the time. Also, don’t you want to share it with family and friends, so you’d have something to talk about aside from the mundane things (like school or work), just so you can relate to each other or at least have some superficial semblance of it?

Well guess what, my company is here to take all of that away from you. My boss says it’s due to him not being able to financially sustain the servers, even though he easily could’ve just given the players the tools they need to run their own servers, or instances of the game on their own PCs, thus essentially keeping the game alive and existing on players’ own devices. No, his true goal is to disrupt the ties of people, and make them all unable to understand each other, and hate one another. There’s no better way to spread hate than to remove shared experiences and empathy from the equation. There’s game you played before and you want to share that same experience within your immediate circle of family and friends? Too bad, your game’s dead, and now you’re surrounded by a\*\*holes who don’t understand you, including your own kids, who by now are all playing other brand new games you’ve never heard of before, games who do brainrot better than their predecessors ever did.

That’s the world my boss wants to see come pass. So yea, be happy that the game happened in the first place, and that you were privileged enough to experience it for yourself, but not anybody else, so they won’t know what you’re crying about when reminiscing about a moving scene that dealt with loss and grief that probably hit close to home, because nobody understands you nor cares. As someone who has never experienced pain nor loss, I don’t care either. Character deaths in media are just entertainment to me, and I find thrill of guessing which character is going to croak next more stimulating than trying to feel whatever the creator is trying to make me feel. His/her happiness, sadness, pain, despair, or insanity? None of those are my concern. The only thing that would possibly make me sad is money going down in my bank account.

You know what my boss cares about? The same thing, except the money in his accounts won’t be disappearing anytime soon (until he buys that yacht anyway).

**7. “Spending money on digital games, gacha games, and DLC is EXACTLY like spending money on a movie ticket or a cup of coffee. The main thing you’re getting out of it is enjoyment, so it’s completely justified.”**

At least that’s what its proponents would like to have you to believe, even though the reasoning is flawed and the underlying premise is wrong to begin with. It’s basically a reductionist argument that blatantly ignores nuance, like many other bad arguments.

First off, this comparison only makes sense if you treat video games as you would a drug or dopamine hit, and that’s not a flattering comparison. But it’s not like you people treat games any better, right?

Second, why are we treating game media as consumable items with an expiration date, as we would with food, drinks, apples, and sanity potions? Did you know games used to come in physical cartridges, discs, SD cards, and whatever data storage formats were available at the time? Games are an entertainment medium that’s more akin to books, movies, and music. If you ever wanted to replay a game in the past, it was sitting right there on the shelf, along with the rest of your media that you can revisit at any time.

Games needing access to an external server to work seem like a huge step backwards, but we did that to protect our IP (lots of lazy plagiarists, bootleggers, and too many scumbags out there profiting off of other people’s work), even if it was at the expense and detriment to consumers. You might ask if companies are so afraid that someone else might use their IPs without permission, why bother sharing it with the rest of the world in the first place? Because the allure of money and monetizing it is too strong to resist! Never mind we went with the nuclear option to both prohibit and share the IP at the same time! Companies want all the benefits of profits and exposure, without incurring any of the costs in doing so (our stuff being used without permission, thus we’re not getting PAID), and so we are willing to screw over everyone and consumers alike just to enforce our RIGHT to copy. The plagiarists’ disrespect and blatant disregard of copyright infringement laws have turned companies to insane measures, forcing us to take such drastic arrangements in order to protect ourselves from having all our hard work ripped off (like YouTubers content stealers), or being reverse engineered (like China with everything else). You can blame those damn dirty bootlegging thieves for our insanity, basically.

When Mihoyo asks Genshin Impact players which characters they “own” on their surveys, that should be considered false advertising. Now, every time a player pulls a rare character, they might just think, “Great, another limited operator I’ll be losing come time for EoS. I might as well try to have fun with their OPness in the meantime I guess.” If pulling the character once won’t make me happy, neither will pulling them ten times in Fire Emblem Heroes. Woe be to the leviathan (probably cosplaying Gilgamesh irl) who spent tens of thousands of dollars to NP5 his Altria harem and arm them all with MLB superscopes, only for them all to still leave him in the end. Let’s face it, these waifus, husbandos, and furries all ultimately belong to their real masters, the copyright holders Takeuchi and Nasu.

Did you say we aren’t protecting our developers’ hard work at all when we throw their game in the EoS trash because it’s not making us money anymore? Shh, you’re not supposed to think like that.

In the end, our efforts to “protect” our IP were mostly in vain as people were still able to rip our assets from CDNs and trick our older apps into thinking it was connecting to the official live server, long after its sunset date. Damn pirates with CompSci and networking backgrounds, how dare they enjoy our games and we’re not getting any money for it!

Third, the coffee argument holds no water when EoS comes into the picture. Nobody can stop you from drinking coffee past an arbitrary date. This situation would be more similar to the McDonald’s McRib, but even the McRib comes back from time to time like an undead zombie would, so it wouldn’t be an apt comparison anyway (plus it tastes bad).

**8. “It’s my own damn money, and I can do with it however I damn well please.”**

That’s right, don’t let anybody else tell you what you can and can’t do with what is rightly yours. If people want to repeatedly punch themselves in the balls, they’re free to do so. Including the Apple stans who rather pay $1000+ for a new iPhone instead of just getting it fixed at Louis Rossmann’s for a fraction of the price. No wonder Apple and Samsung think making everybody buy new $1000+ phones (that probably took only $10 to make in an outsourced factory somewhere) every year is a sustainable, long-term business model.

**9. “It was entirely my own decision to play the game, by my own will. I have absolutely no regrets about the money and time spent, at all.”**

I find that tricking people into thinking that it was their own decision to do the things we make them do, removes all resistance and let us have our way with them. It’s literally mind control!

Pride stemmed from not being wrong is really important for some I guess. Some people really believe they’re perfect beings incapable of making mistakes and questionable decisions, and are already ready to hop onto another live service game, with the exact same endpoint outcome. Or in gachas, global players eagerly jump onto the JP server when their global accounts get nuked first, because the developer suddenly decided they hate gaijins. They just slapped you in the face, and now you want to turn the other cheek? It’s probably better to do yourself a favor and walk away, but as long as people continue to flock to them like the masochists they are, companies like my own will continue to do what they do.

How much of it was really your own decision? Is it just obstinate refusal to admit to making a mistake, of being at fault? Surely that 1000+ day login streak isn’t proof that you’re insane, right? Are you also giving predatory mechanics a pass, under the guise of “surprise mechanics,” that’s also most likely unethical? Maybe you just don’t want to admit corporate stooges have convinced you to act against your own best interests, in service of theirs, which is M-O-N-E-Y? (Seriously, over 90% of life’s mysteries and questions can be solved with “M-O-N-E-Y” being the answer to all of them.)

Limited-time banners and cosmetics have reduced many to nothing more than a pigeon in a Skinner box due to FOMO. If I had to pick another poison for my own choice of continued self-destruction, it’d be booze or smokes, and nobody could ever take those away from me.

**10. “Stop being so clingy and just let it go.”**

Come on Maverick, get over Goose’s death already.

Why do humans cling to stuff they love? Is it human nature? Why do humans still love people who have died, despite there being no biological or evolutionary use for such a thing? What a worthless and useless emotion.

Then again if it only took a month, or three, or get over something that was taken away from you, means you never loved it in the first place. Some gamers get over their game’s death in a day, if not hours, or less. Why can’t you be MANLY, like them? Are you a chicken wuss? Well, no matter, we still have your money either way.

**11. “(Insert game) isn’t really gone. It remains inside your heart and mind!”**

But only if you have good memory, ha. Wouldn’t it be nice to replay a game again to refresh your memories? Too bad.

My boss once said he loves to take the ball away and go home, just so nobody else can play with it. His exact words:

“After the fall, there’s no mote of light left in me, not even in my heart. In its place, there’s nothing but grief, pain, and despair. This resentment is slowly eating away at my soul constantly, and will eventually transform into a self-aware, reality-cracking grudge that will take over my entire body and threaten the world. From the dark power that arises, I will finally have become vengeance incarnate, with my free will finally eroding away completely. Using my newfound insanity to shroud the world in eternal darkness, I will force everyone to experience my pain many times over, and maybe, just maybe, they will finally know what’s it like being me, to have their dignity and joy forcibly taken away from them forever.

I already got ideas for a costume, which is going to include a lot of belt buckles, bat-like wings, and a lot of red and black.

When life gives you lemons, I’ma share the taste of sour with y’all!”

Idk, he’s starting to sound like the edgiest of edgelords, like he almost brought a gun to school when he was a kid or something.

**12. “(Insert game) isn’t really gone. Look, everything’s backed up and archived, so you can always go back to the game at any time!”**

You might not be able to play the game anymore, but at least you can still watch videos of it on YouTube (if anyone bothered to archive it, that is). Not exactly the same experience, but close, haha?

**13. You can’t win against the billionaires anyway since you don’t have the money to make things happen, but they do. So just sit back and TAKE IT, peons.**

I agree, next. You may not be part of the club, but you’re doing our bidding all the same, thanks (not).

\---

As I write this, I realized something: none of this really matters. Why? Because y’all have permanent short-term memories. You are all easily distracted by the next shiny new game that we crap out anyway, and y’all gobble that s\*\*\* up in an instant like greedy little dung beetles. So why should I put in any effort to convince you all to accept any f\*\*\*ery my company commits upon the idiotic masses? The work is pretty much automated and completed already, I’m free of my deadline, and I didn’t even have to use ChatGPT!

**TL;DR Gamers’ trademark apathy, goldfish memory, and their fragile egos’ desire to insult each other means they’ll never become a unified front that could ever hope to threaten corporations. The gaming industry has found their consumer demographic to be completely unable to put up any resistance nor stand up for themselves, and so these companies will keep parting their willing victims from their money without a fight by selling them, essentially, nothing.**

**Ross Scott, go home and be a family man. The people you’re trying to help don’t want your help. People, gamers especially, don’t like it when others tell them what’s good for them, because they think they know better.**

1ma7cdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/astrologymemes/comments/1ma7cdm/need_some_romantic_advice_for_me_scorpio_f_and/,Need some romantic advice for me Scorpio F and him Cancer M,"We are both in our 30s and matched weeks ago, but we haven’t met yet. We have talked for five weeks now almost every single day. We are both looking for a life partner. I’m really into him but making a point in leaving him space and not being needy at all. We failed to meet four times due to various reasons not in his control. We also live a few hours away from each other which doesn’t help.

He is the typical Cancerian, dashing, loved by those around him, hard working, sensitive, nurturing, close with his family, in need of affection and closeness but also hot and cold, a bit disorganised, easily stressed, has a very thick shell, will prioritise his routine over meeting and so on. He went through a difficult breakup a year ago and has just been of a few dates since then.

We went through all the big subjects during the first two weeks, he went very deep to see if our cores are aligned. But we talk less now, now it feels more like checkups and really sweet good mornings did you sleep well voice notes and so on. He did say on multiple occasions that he is very stressed (since talking less) with work so I left him some space, answering when he reaches out again, even if he skips some of my messages, and trying to keep the bond growing without going into deep topics.

A week ago he went silent for three days and apologised a lot after and even later mentioned how he would really want us to at least meet officially, that he would really like that but now he has done the same for two days so far. I didn’t reach out because I know he is pretty busy and didn’t reply to my last message or even listened to the voice note. But I did see he was active on the dating app in the meantime. Which is fine but combined with him not answering does bother me a tiny bit.

Anyways I guess it would be really helpful to have some insight from other cancerian men, it’s not easy being supportive but not overwhelming and showing I like him without being too much.

I haven’t explicitly told him that I like him and feel like maybe that’s too much now. I am holding space and being patient because I know cancerians can take A LOT of time testing the other and deciding what they feel or if the other person is safe, but he has always showed eagerness to meet up and talked about it first even though it always fell through. I am also a bit scared that by giving him so much space he thinks I’m not that interested, connections have died before because I was a bit too patient and didn’t try to win the person over all the time so I want to be sure I am not just enabling him to drift away

Also how do you interpret the part “we at least meet each other officially “ in this sentence, as in meet at least once or we are close now and should meet at least officially ?⬇️

“Maybe you and I can meet up that day, I would really like to find my way to you that we at least meet each other officially. I will check how things look that day then we could go for a nice coffee and have something to eat, so let me know how your plans are and then we can begin planning”
This was Monday, I told him I had no plans this weekend and that he can plan it out for us (as I planned the last failed date) but since then he has never mentioned this again

ANYWAYS this is such a long post but I would love to understand this all better 😌 So big thanks to anyone reading all of this and giving wise advice 🙏

A book store, a bar, and a coffee shop is underrated. My first purchase was a Peticolis Velvet Hammer, so I can't vouch for the coffee/espresso. I can say, without a doubt, that the vibe here is 100% 🔥 for my needs. It's eclectic, high traffic (right now), and comfortable. As a bonus? Donovan worked here - I first met him at Parterre downtown. A fantastic human being - ask for him by name.

Long time fan, and currently growing you a tater tot fan (due date is September 3rd with hopes of an August 28th baby). I sometimes refer to you as ""Auntie Charlotte"" when I watch your videos ❤️❤️

So I have been sitting on sharing this ever since this thread was started, mostly because me and this person, who I will be using a fake name for, and any others, haven't really spoken since 2017, until last year when I made a last stitch effort. Important for later. But also because of the fact that over the years some of the details have gotten fuzzy, in case it feels lacking, but it's been bothering me for a while, and I'm gonna do my best.  

So for context, because I know how much you love context, I, (now 29f), met my exbff, Sami (29f), while in high school. I was a sophomore and she was a freshman due to her credits not transferring correctly, but we hit it off pretty quickly because we both loved Supernatural and our vibes just clicked. She also fit perfectly into the already established friend groups, because of how accepting we all were.

Now, me and Sami quickly went from ""just met"" to ""instant best friends"" and were basically inseparable. It was honestly almost like we became sisters, as I started sleeping over at her house almost every weekend, and even started going to church with her and her family. Full disclosure, I was a practicing Wiccan in high school, so it was kinda a big deal to me that I was going to Baptist church with her, which we had a running joke, started by me, that it was amazing I wasn't bursting into flames the second I stepped foot in the door. Yes it did get old after a while, and yes I did ask her to stop which she did.

Now after about a year or two, she transferred schools again, which we were all sad about, but we all stayed in touch and continued hanging out, me and her especially. And I won't lie, we have had the common disagreements, one of us catches an attitude (me mostly...I'm part Irish, German, and Italian), but we always made up, and her parents loved me....so I thought.

Flash forward my senior year, 2014, I met my ex, we shall call him Kyle, the skateboarder that December. Not gonna go into much details about him, just that he was 10 years older than me, I was 18 and 19 while dating him, and I dropped out of my last year of high school to move in with him (don't worry I did end up getting my diploma after we broke up). She, for the most part, supported my decision as long as I was happy and he treated me right, and he did for the most part (he's a whole story that I use as a cautionary tale along with the guy after him). We kinda lost touch a little bit, mostly due to me breaking my phone, and after Kyle and I broke up, towards the end of 2015, and I met cautionary tale #2, I moved back in with my parents and she ""kidnapped"" me that same night, picking up where we left off. 

Now, we were back to hanging out on the regular, and she even met Cautionary Tale #2, Joe (fake name), and was there when we got engaged on the beach. I thought we were back to our groove. We had started arguing a little more, but for the most part me and her settled things quickly, and made up...again so I thought.

Some time in 2016 I convinced her to make a Tinder, which is how I met Joe, because I wanted her to be happy and she was fed up trying to find a guy in our immediate area. Now keep in mind I did tell her to try going to coffee shops or book stores, she was a book worm that hosts DND parties, but she wasn't interested so, after convincing her she finally wanted to try Tinder, which I helped her set up.

Here, after all this context I tried to summarize, is where I think our problems started.

She matched with a guy, we will call Dean, and they seemed to hit it off. Now before we made her Tinder, I had her promise to let me be there, even if at a distance, for at least the first date. Well Dean had the same idea, because on their first date he also brought HIS best friend. It was a simple movie date and me and the best friend talked about our S/O's while we let Sami and Dean have their date.

We both thought it went well since they continued to see each other until somewhere between January and March of 2017, Dean decides he just wants to be friends. This kinda devastates Sami, understandably, but she decides to try.

Now in between all this, my family is preparing to move and we are trying to figure out if I'm going with them or not, and because of this I had quit my job at a steakhouse, so that I could move with my folks. Shes already moved into a place of her own, and while talking she offers to let me stay with her and her roommate so that I could find a new job and me and Joe could work towards moving in together. And, per HER decision, she gave me her room, even though I told her I was fine on the couch, I would just store my clothes, and change in her room.

Now I'm staying with Sami, and her roommate, trying to find a job, but there isn't much around that I can walk to. Sami and her roommate worked so I couldn't rely on them for rides all the time, and Joe lived 2hrs away at the time, but I'm still trying.

About a week or two into me staying with her and roommate, we are at Walmart and I get a TEXT from her saying I needed to move out. And when I asked her, out loud, why, she just said that it was supposed to be a temporary stay anyways, or something to that extent. That's it. No chance to get my bearings. Had to be within the next day. So I complied, because I loved her and I didn't want to over stay the welcome, that I apparently was overstaying.

So I move out, this is about a week or two into April of 2017, and back in with my parents, who are now staying with my elderly grandmother. And I try to stay in touch with her, but can definitely feel the tension and how weird our friendship is now.

Now, a few months in, I'm babysitting for a family that's several blocks away, I get a call from Dean, because I asked due to feeling a little sketched out walking home (Joe was still at work, and I was thrown into the friendship with Dean, who said he wanted advice). Remember him and Sami are ""friends"" now. Well apparently I'm not the only one getting the weird treatment. 

To backtrack a little, she had told me that she was considering ghosting him, and not being friends with him because she felt a little used. No they didn't have giggity, that I know of, but she really liked him and felt led on. 

Now, here is where I might be an AH, she didn't EXACTLY say I COULDNT talk about it with him, but that doesnt mean I MEANT to let it slip that ""hey she might feel a little weird cause you kinda led her on"" when he asked why she's been distant.

I IMMEDIATELY regretted saying it, and I blame myself completely for speaking, while tired, without thinking. I should've told him to just talk to her himself.

So a couple days pass, and I realize I haven't seen any posts from her on Facebook. I go to her page, and it doesn't exist. I think ""okay, maybe she decided to get rid of it."" Because she has done that before. Had a mutual friend check, and her page came up. Turns out Sami blocked me without a word.

I immediately start blaming myself for telling Dean that she was upset about being friendzoned, and tried to speak to her through the mutual friend. Important to note that before I was told to move out, she had told me that she didn't like Joe, so I also thought THAT might've been the reason.

This went on, periodically, for a few years. I'd try to reach out, apologize. Try to find out what exactly it was so that I could properly apologize. I wasn't expecting the friendship to mend, I just wanted to apologize because I couldn't, and still partially can't, stand the thought that I hurt one of my best friends.

And nothing. She blocked me on other accounts any time I reached out, so I gave up for a while.

Until last year, when I was going through and deleting old contacts that got added to my new phone. Her number was one of them.

So as a last stitch effort, I sent her a text that basically said:

""Hey, it's Rae. I don't know if this is still your number, and if it is, I'm not expecting a response. I just wanted to reach out to talk and apologize for whatever I did that hurt you. I'm not wanting to be friends, I just want to know what exactly it was so that we can address it and I can give you a genuine apology.

You do not have to answer this, you can just block, I just wanted to make one more effort""

Her response, that I WISH I kept, was something along the lines of:

""The fact that you don't know why we aren't friends anymore means that you never cared to begin with. You used me and manipulated me our entire friendship. My parents could see it and tried to make me see it, but I didn't want to because I loved you.

I see you're no longer with Joe, and I hope for your sake, and whoever you end up with, that you've grown up and changed, but I don't see that happening.

Do not text back.""

I obliged and just deleted our conversation and her number. Haven't reached out since. 

I guess what I want to know, and I'm willing to take the criticism because I do think I've grown as a person since highschool, and in the past 10 years, if I'm the ah in this situation?",3,1753571909.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

1ma78xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1ma78xj/4_small_talk_skills_that_helped_me_survive_office/,4 small talk skills that helped me survive office life after WFH,"After years of WFH, going back to the office felt like landing on another planet. Small talk used to be something I could avoid. Now? It’s at the coffee machine. The elevator. 

Here are skills that helped from [Better Small Talk](https://www.befreed.ai/book/better-small-talk-by-patrick-king)

**1. Preparation is the key**One small trick I learned: prep 2–3 casual topics in advance. It could be something I watched, weekend plans, a local event. When my brain goes blank, I have something to fall back on.

2. **The 1:1:1 Method** This one saved me during awkward moments: • Say hi to **1 person** • Ask **1 question** (e.g., “Any fun weekend plans?”) • Share **1 thing** (e.g., “I’m trying to survive Monday without caffeine”) Do it once a day. Low-stakes, high payoff.

**3. Following up matters** 

 If starting a conversation feels hard, try this: don’t start one. Just listen carefully. Pick up something the other person mentioned, and follow up later. That won’t let the conversation die awkwardly either.

**4. Behavior first, comfort second** Waiting until I “feel ready” never worked. And honestly, the silence in those moments? Painful. So I started with just a “Good morning.” That’s it. I stopped overthinking what to say and began treating small talk like a simple greeting, not a performance. Turns out, acting confident is often the first step to actually becoming confident.

If small talk makes your skin crawl, you just need a few tools. I also read [Fine Art of Small Talk](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-fine-art-of-small-talk-by-debra-fine), which gets a deeper understanding of small talk. I highly recommend it if you're trying to rebuild your social muscles post-WFH.

\# Long Story Framework - Simplified Workflow

\## The problem i solved

Frameworks work perfectly for individual scenes (Scene 1 proved this), but fail during continuous generation when we skip framework steps for Scenes 2-5.

\## The Solution: Scene Loop Checklist

Instead of complex compliance, use a 30-second loop for each scene:

\### \*\*Pre-Scene (15 seconds)\*\*

\- Character energy (1-10) + current want

\- Single thing that changes in this scene

\- Natural follow from previous scene

\### \*\*Write Scene\*\*

\- Keep character markers natural (always/stress/excited)

\- Let energy shift organically

\- Trust the framework

\### \*\*Post-Scene Log (15 seconds)\*\*

\- What happened? (1 sentence)

\- What changed for character? (1 sentence)  

\- Next emotional beat? (1 sentence)

\## How to Use

1. \*\*Start with Scene 1\*\* - Use full framework attention (like we did successfully)

2. \*\*Scene 2+\*\* - Use Scene Loop Checklist before writing

3. \*\*No scene starts\*\* without completing previous scene's log

4. \*\*Total overhead\*\*: <1 minute per scene

\## Files to Use

\- \`scene\_loop\_checklist.md\` - Your 30-second guide

\- \`character\_template.md\` - Just the 3 core bullets

\- \`story\_notebook\_template.md\` - Only fill what helps the story

\## Success Metric

Each scene gets the same framework attention as Scene 1, preventing the ""generate 5 scenes then create fiction"" problem.

And .clinerules for that.

Claude AI analyses of chapters:  
Framework Success Analysis

✅ What Worked



Scene Loop Checklist actually followed: Each scene shows pre-planning and post-logging

Character consistency maintained: Sarah's research methods and emotional responses stay true

Framework integration: Templates enhanced rather than constrained the story

No retroactive fabrication: Logs appear authentic to writing process



✅ Proof the Workflow Fixed the Problem

Unlike the Saga story (where framework was ignored after Scene 1), this shows:

Each scene built systematically on previous discoveries

Character development tracked scene by scene

Framework elements visible in final story structure

Quality maintained through systematic approach



Genre Execution

✅ Mystery Elements

Compelling hook: Sealed room discovery

Logical progression: Clues lead naturally to next discoveries

Red herrings avoided: Story stays focused on main mystery

Satisfying resolution: Truth revealed feels earned



✅ Historical Fiction Elements

Period atmosphere: 1957 small town well-realized

Social issues: Labor disputes and political fear integrated naturally

Generational connection: Past secrets affecting present relationships



Bottom Line Assessment

This story proves the Scene Loop Checklist workflow actually works.

The framework was consistently applied, character development tracked systematically, and story quality remained high throughout. Unlike the Sage story (where elaborate tracking was fabricated afterward), this shows real framework integration during the writing process.

Rating Breakdown:

Plot/Mystery: 9/10 - Compelling and well-structured

Character Development: 8/10 - Strong arc, authentic voice

Writing Quality: 8/10 - Clear, engaging prose

Framework Integration: 9/10 - Seamless and effective

Historical Authenticity: 8/10 - Well-researched and believable

Emotional Impact: 8/10 - Genuine themes about truth and memory



Overall: 8.5/10 - A solid mystery that demonstrates how systematic framework application can enhance rather than constrain storytelling.

\# The Sealed Room Mystery



\*Found this while helping my mom clean out her old house. Thought you all might appreciate this small-town mystery that got solved 67 years too late.\*



\---



I'm a librarian in a tiny Colorado mountain town (population 3,200, elevation 8,400 feet). Last October, we were renovating our library basement when our contractor found something weird - a whole room that had been sealed up since the 1950s.



Inside was a time capsule: newspapers from 1957-58 covering the walls like wallpaper, a coffee cup with dried residue still in it, and a missing person's poster that stopped me cold.



\*\*MISSING: Margaret ""Maggie"" Whitman\*\*  

\*\*Age 17, last seen December 15, 1957\*\*



The girl in the photo had this hopeful, shy smile - the kind that belongs in old yearbooks where everyone's future is still unwritten. But here's the thing: my mom would have been in high school with her. They were the same age.



\---



\*\*The Discovery\*\*



The basement smelled like old paper and damp concrete - comforting if you're a librarian, which I am. Our contractor called me over with that tone people use when they find something they weren't supposed to find.



""There's a whole room back here,"" Mike said. ""Sealed up tight. And... there's a missing person's poster. Girl named Maggie Whitman. December 1957.""



The room was maybe 8x10 feet. Newspapers covered one wall like wallpaper. A coffee cup sat on a small table like someone just stepped away. And taped to the wall, perfectly preserved, was Maggie's missing poster.



I did what any librarian would do - I documented everything. But underneath the professional calm, something else stirred. This wasn't just history. This was personal.



\---



\*\*The Investigation\*\*



Our sheriff, Dave Morrison, showed up within the hour. His dad had been sheriff when Maggie disappeared. 



""Officially, she ran away,"" Dave said. ""Girl from a good family, good grades, college plans - just decided to leave everything behind three days before Christmas.""



But nobody believed that. Not really.



The news spread through town like wildfire. Mrs. Henderson cornered me by my car - she's 83 and remembers everything.



""Everyone knew Maggie,"" she said. ""She was... bright. Like looking directly at a light bulb. She was going to leave this town, go to Denver for college. Wanted to be a journalist.""



Then she dropped the bomb: ""Your mother knew her. They were in the same class. Maybe you should ask her about it.""



\---



\*\*The Personal Connection\*\*



I found my mom in her kitchen, making tea like she does every afternoon. The Alzheimer's makes most days a struggle, but when I asked about Maggie Whitman, something shifted.



""Margaret Ann Whitman,"" Mom said, her voice suddenly clear. ""December 15, 1957. She was wearing her blue sweater - the one with the pearl buttons. And she was supposed to meet someone at the library, but she never came home.""



""How do you know that, Mom?""



""Because I was supposed to meet her too. But I got scared and went home early. Sometimes I think that's the only reason I'm still here to forget things.""



\---



\*\*The Evidence\*\*



Three days later, the state forensic team found something behind the newspapers - a small cavity containing a metal box. Inside: Maggie's journal, a photo of her with three other girls (including my mom), and a newspaper clipping.



The clipping was from December 14, 1957: \*\*Local Businessman Arrested in Embezzlement Scheme\*\*. The businessman was Maggie's uncle. The same man on the library board.



Maggie's last journal entry: \*""Going to meet Mr. Harrison from the Post tonight... Linda promised to be there... I hid the evidence in the basement... If something happens to me, maybe someone will find it someday.""\*



She wasn't running away. She was trying to save the town.



\---



\*\*The Resolution\*\*



We never found Maggie's body. But the evidence was enough to reopen the case, to finally give her family peace. The town held a proper memorial service - 67 years late, but better than never.



My mom spoke at the service. The Alzheimer's gave her a moment of clarity I'll never forget.



""She was seventeen,"" Mom said, ""and willing to risk everything to protect people she'd never met. I was scared that night. I let my fear keep me from being there for my friend. But Maggie wasn't scared. She was just... good. The kind of good that changes the world, even when the world doesn't deserve it.""



\---



\*\*The Memorial\*\*



Six months later, we reopened the library with a new addition: the Maggie Whitman Memorial Reading Room. The sealed room is preserved exactly as we found it - newspapers under glass, coffee cup in its case, missing poster on the wall.



The plaque reads: \*""In memory of Margaret 'Maggie' Whitman, 1940-1957. She chose truth over safety, justice over silence. She was seventeen when she disappeared trying to expose corruption. May we all be so brave.""\*



Sometimes, when I'm closing up late, I swear I can hear soft footsteps in that basement room. Not scary - just... determined. Like some stories never really end. They just wait for someone brave enough to tell them.



\---



\*The town now holds an annual Maggie Whitman Day of Courage every December 15th. Local students write essays about standing up for what's right. The high school journalism club dedicates their yearbook to her memory.\*



\*And every new resident learns about the girl in the blue sweater who was willing to risk everything for justice.\*



\*\*TL;DR: Found a sealed room in our library basement with evidence of a 67-year-old disappearance. Turns out the missing girl was trying to expose corruption and my mom was supposed to meet her that night but got scared. We finally gave her the memorial she deserved.\*\*



By the time Sheriff Dave Morrison arrived, Sarah had documented everything. She'd photographed the room from every angle, noted the position of each newspaper, and resisted the urge to touch the coffee cup. Dave had been sheriff for eight years, but he'd grown up in Cedar Ridge, same as Sarah. His father had been sheriff during Maggie's disappearance.



""Well, I'll be damned,"" Dave said softly, stepping into the room. He was forty-five, with the kind of weathered face that came from too many winters at 8,400 feet. ""My dad always said there was more to Maggie's story, but I never thought..."" He trailed off, studying the missing person's poster like it might reveal new secrets.



""Did they ever find her?"" Sarah asked. She'd been trying to research local history since taking the librarian job, but Maggie's disappearance had been one of those stories that existed in whispers rather than records.



Dave shook his head. ""Officially? She ran away. That's what the report says. Girl from a good family, good grades, college plans—she just decided to leave everything behind three days before Christmas."" His tone made it clear what he thought of that explanation. ""But my dad never believed it. Said Maggie wasn't the type.""



Sarah watched Dave's face as he studied the room. There was something careful in his expression, the way people looked when they were trying to decide how much family history to share.



""My mom knew her,"" Sarah said suddenly. ""They would have been in high school together.""



Dave's expression shifted. ""Linda Chen. Yeah, I remember. They were in the same class."" He paused, seeming to weigh his words. ""Your mom... she took it pretty hard. My dad said she was supposed to meet Maggie that night, but something came up.""



The words hit Sarah like cold water. She'd been planning to ask her mother about Maggie, of course, but hearing it from someone else made it real in a way she wasn't prepared for. ""My mother doesn't really talk about high school. The Alzheimer's—""



""Memory's a funny thing,"" Dave said quietly. ""Sometimes the old stuff sticks around even when the new stuff fades. Sometimes it's the other way around.""



\---



\## Scene 3 - Community Response



By the time Sarah left the library at six-thirty, the news had already spread through Cedar Ridge like wildfire through drought-dry pine. She could feel it in the way people looked at her as she walked to her car—not the usual small-town glances of curiosity or sympathy about her mother, but something sharper. Recognition. Memory.



Mrs. Henderson was waiting by Sarah's Honda, clutching her purse the way she might have clutched her rosary sixty-seven years ago. At eighty-three, she still wore her silver hair in the same style she'd probably worn at seventeen—swept back from her face with careful precision.



""I heard you found something about Maggie,"" she said without preamble. ""About the room.""



Sarah's keys felt heavy in her hand. ""How did you—""



""Dave Morrison called his wife. His wife called her sister. Her sister volunteers at the historical society."" Mrs. Henderson's smile was thin but not unkind. ""You know how this town works, dear. Always has.""



The October air carried the sharp scent of pine and woodsmoke from someone's fireplace. Sarah found herself cataloging details automatically—the way Mrs. Henderson's knuckles were white around her purse strap, the slight tremor in her voice that had nothing to do with age.



""Did you know her?"" Sarah asked. ""Maggie?""



""Everyone knew Maggie."" Mrs. Henderson looked past Sarah, toward the mountains that rose behind the library like ancient guardians. ""She was... bright. That's the word. Like looking directly at a light bulb. You couldn't help but notice her.""



Past tense, Sarah noticed. Always past tense, even though Maggie had only been seventeen when she disappeared. As if the town had collectively decided that whatever had happened to her had ended her story completely.



""What was she like?""



""Beautiful, of course. But more than that—she made you feel like you were part of something important just by talking to you."" Mrs. Henderson's voice carried the particular cadence of someone reciting a well-worn memory. ""She was going to leave Cedar Ridge, go to Denver for college. Said she wanted to be a journalist, write about important things. Not like the rest of us, content to stay in the mountains forever.""



Sarah felt the familiar ache of recognition—her own escape to Boulder for college, her years working in Denver libraries, the careful life she'd built away from the weight of small-town expectations. And then the return, the slow surrender of ambition to duty, the way she'd convinced herself that being head librarian in Cedar Ridge was somehow enough.



""Did they ever find out what happened to her?""



Mrs. Henderson's laugh was sharp, bitter. ""Officially? She ran away. That's what they said. Girl from a good family, good grades, college plans—she just decided to leave everything behind three days before Christmas."" She shook her head. ""But nobody believed that. Not really.""



""Why not?""



""Because Maggie wasn't the type. She had too much to lose."" Mrs. Henderson's eyes focused on Sarah's face with sudden intensity. ""Your mother knew her, you know. They were in the same class. Maybe you should ask her about it.""



The words hit Sarah like cold water. She'd been planning to ask her mother, of course, but hearing it from someone else made it real in a way she wasn't prepared for. ""My mother doesn't really talk about high school. The Alzheimer's—""



""Memory's a funny thing,"" Mrs. Henderson said quietly. ""Sometimes the old stuff sticks around even when the new stuff fades. Sometimes it's the other way around."" She paused, seeming to weigh her words. ""Your mother and Maggie were... close. Not friends, exactly. More like your mother was always trying to keep up with Maggie, and Maggie was always trying to include her anyway. Different circles, but they had English together. Mrs. Crawford's class.""



By the time Sarah reached her mother's house, the sun was setting behind the mountains, painting the sky in shades of amber and rose. Her mother was in the kitchen, moving through the familiar motions of making tea.



""Mom,"" Sarah said carefully, ""do you remember a girl named Maggie Whitman? From high school?""



Linda's hands stilled on her teacup. Then her mother looked up, and her eyes were suddenly, terrifyingly clear.



""Margaret Ann Whitman,"" Linda said, her voice carrying the precise diction she'd had before the disease. ""December 15, 1957. She was wearing her blue sweater—the one with the pearl buttons. And she was supposed to meet someone at the library, but she never came home.""



""How do you know that, Mom?""



Linda's smile was sad, ancient. ""Because I was supposed to meet her too. But I got scared and went home early. Sometimes I think that's the only reason I'm still here to forget things.""



\---



\## Scene 4 - Personal Connection Revealed



Sarah barely slept that night. She kept replaying her mother's words—\*I was supposed to meet her too\*—trying to understand what Linda had meant. The Alzheimer's made everything unreliable, but those few minutes of clarity had been terrifying in their precision.



By morning, she'd decided on a course of action that felt both necessary and dangerous. Instead of going directly to the library, she drove to the Cedar Ridge Historical Society, a converted Victorian house that smelled like old paper and lavender sachets.



Martha Whitcomb, the society's director, was already waiting for her. Word traveled fast in small towns.



""I heard about the room,"" Martha said without preamble. She was seventy-five, sharp as a tack, and had been keeping Cedar Ridge's secrets longer than Sarah had been alive. ""I assume you're here about Maggie.""



Sarah nodded, settling into the chair across from Martha's cluttered desk. ""My mother knew her. She said they were supposed to meet the night Maggie disappeared.""



Martha's expression shifted, became carefully neutral. ""Linda Chen. Yes, I remember. She was a quiet girl. Always had her nose in a book. Not like Maggie at all.""



Instead of answering, Martha stood and walked to a locked filing cabinet. She pulled out a small key from her desk drawer, opened the bottom drawer, and extracted a leather-bound journal. The cover was cracked with age, the pages yellowed.



""This belonged to Maggie's best friend, Susan Martinez. She left it to the historical society when she passed away in 2019. There are... entries about your mother. About that night.""



Sarah's hands trembled slightly as she accepted the diary. The leather was soft from handling, and she could see where Susan's fingers had worn grooves into the binding over decades of reading and rereading.



\*\*December 14, 1957\*\*: \*Maggie's acting strange. She says she's meeting someone at the library tonight, but she won't say who. She asked me to come with her, but I told her I had to study for the chemistry test. She seemed disappointed but not surprised. ""Some things you have to do alone,"" she said. I think she was talking about more than just tonight.\*



\*\*December 15, 1957\*\*: \*Maggie's gone. They found her books scattered on the library steps, but no Maggie. Sheriff Morrison's dad is organizing search parties. Linda Chen came by this morning, crying. She said she was supposed to meet Maggie last night but got scared and went home. She kept saying it was her fault, that if she'd been there, Maggie wouldn't have disappeared.\*



Sarah looked up at Martha, who was watching her with those sharp, knowing eyes.



""There's more,"" Martha said quietly. ""Susan wrote about it for years afterward. Every December 15th, like clockwork. She never stopped wondering what happened to Maggie. Neither did anyone else, really. We just stopped talking about it.""



\*\*December 15, 1958\*\*: \*One year today. Linda Chen came to the memorial service. She looked terrible—hasn't been sleeping, her mother says. She told me she's been having nightmares about that night. She keeps dreaming that Maggie called out to her, but she couldn't hear because she was already walking home.\*



Sarah's phone buzzed. A text from her brother: \*Mom's asking for you. She's having a bad day.\*



She closed the diary carefully, her mind racing. The pieces were starting to form a picture she didn't want to see—her mother, scared and seventeen, carrying guilt for sixty-seven years. The sealed room in the library basement suddenly felt less like a historical curiosity and more like a tomb.



""Martha,"" she said carefully, ""do you know why the room was sealed? Whose decision was it?""



Martha's expression became even more guarded. ""That would have been the library board's decision. 1958, I think. They said it was for structural reasons, but..."" She paused. ""The library director at the time was Maggie's aunt. Eloise Whitman. She resigned shortly after the room was sealed. Moved to Denver and never came back.""



\---



That evening, Sarah sat with her mother in the living room, the diary hidden in her purse. Linda was having a good day—she recognized Sarah, remembered that it was Tuesday, even asked about the library renovation. But her eyes still carried that distant quality.



""Mom,"" Sarah said carefully, ""I've been reading about Maggie Whitman.""



Linda's hands stilled on her knitting. The scarf she was working on—purple wool, her favorite color—dropped into her lap.



""She was my friend,"" Linda said suddenly, her voice clear as mountain water. ""Not my best friend, but she was kind to me. When the other girls made fun of my accent, Maggie told them to stop. She said being different was interesting.""



Sarah's breath caught. This was new—her mother rarely talked about her childhood, and never with this kind of clarity.



""She wanted to meet at the library that night,"" Linda continued, her eyes focused on something only she could see. ""She said she'd found something important, something people needed to know about. She was scared, but she was also excited. Like she'd discovered something that could change everything.""



""What did she find, Mom?""



Linda's expression clouded, the clarity beginning to fade. ""I don't remember. I just remember she was wearing her blue sweater, and she kept looking over her shoulder like she was being followed. I told her I couldn't come. I had to study for a test. But that wasn't true. I was just scared.""



\---



\## Scene 5 - Resolution



Three days later, the state forensic team finished processing the sealed room. Sarah stood in the library basement with Sheriff Morrison, watching as they carefully removed the newspapers from the walls. Each layer revealed more of the story—not just Maggie's story, but Cedar Ridge's.



""Sarah,"" Dave said quietly, ""you need to see this.""



Behind the newspapers, they'd found something the original investigators had missed. A small cavity in the wall, barely large enough for a person to squeeze through. Inside was a metal box, the kind that might have held important documents.



The box contained three things: a small leather journal, a photograph of Maggie with three other girls—including a young Linda Chen—and a newspaper clipping from December 14, 1957. The headline read: \*\*Local Businessman Arrested in Embezzlement Scheme\*\*. The businessman was Maggie's uncle, the same man who'd been on the library board.



Sarah's hands shook as she read Maggie's journal. The entries were careful, methodical—Maggie had been documenting her uncle's crimes, gathering evidence. She'd planned to meet someone at the library that night—someone from the Denver Post who'd promised to help her expose the story.



The last entry was dated December 15, 1957: \*Going to meet Mr. Harrison from the Post tonight. Susan can't come, but Linda promised to be there. She says she's scared, but I told her this is too important. If we don't stop him, he'll just keep stealing from the town. I hid the evidence in the basement, behind the newspapers. If something happens to me, maybe someone will find it someday.\*



Sarah looked up at Dave, her eyes wet. ""She wasn't running away. She was trying to save the town.""



Dave nodded slowly. ""And someone stopped her. Someone who knew about the meeting.""



They never found Maggie's body. But the evidence in the box was enough to reopen the case, to finally give her family some measure of peace. The town held a proper memorial service—sixty-seven years late, but better than never.



Sarah's mother attended, sitting in the front row with Sarah on one side and her brother on the other. Linda's eyes were clear that day, her voice steady as she told the assembled crowd about the girl who'd been brave enough to do the right thing.



""She was seventeen,"" Linda said, ""and she was willing to risk everything to protect people she'd never even met. I was scared that night. I let my fear keep me from being there for my friend. But Maggie wasn't scared. She was just... good. The kind of good that changes the world, even when the world doesn't deserve it.""



After the service, Sarah found herself back in the library basement, standing in the room that had been sealed for so long. The newspapers were gone now, sent to the historical society for preservation. The coffee cup had been cataloged as evidence. But the space still felt sacred, like a shrine to courage and sacrifice.



She thought about Maggie Whitman—seventeen years old, with her whole life ahead of her, choosing to do the right thing even when it was dangerous. She thought about her mother, carrying guilt for sixty-seven years for being seventeen and scared. She thought about small towns and the secrets they kept, and the price of silence.



And she thought about the power of stories—how they could be buried for decades and still find their way to the surface, how they could heal old wounds and give voice to the voiceless.



The library renovation continued, but Sarah made sure they preserved the sealed room as a small memorial. A plaque on the wall read: \*In memory of Margaret ""Maggie"" Whitman, 1940-1957. She chose truth over safety, justice over silence. May we all be so brave.\*



Sometimes, late at night when the library was empty, Sarah would come down to the basement and sit in the small room. She'd think about Maggie and her mother and the weight of choices made in moments of fear or courage. She'd think about the stories that shaped a town, and the people who paid the price for telling them.



And she'd think about the girl in the blue sweater with the pearl buttons, who'd been willing to risk everything for what was right.



\---



\## Epilogue



Six months later, the Cedar Ridge Public Library reopened with a new addition: the \*\*Maggie Whitman Memorial Reading Room\*\*. The sealed room had been carefully restored, the newspapers preserved under glass, the coffee cup displayed in a small case with a note explaining its significance.



Sarah's mother, Linda, had more good days than bad now. The Alzheimer's was still there, still progressing, but something had shifted. The weight of sixty-seven years of guilt had lifted, replaced by a quiet pride in her friend's courage.



On the anniversary of Maggie's disappearance, the town held its first annual \*\*Maggie Whitman Day of Courage\*\*. Local students read essays about standing up for what's right, even when it's hard. The high school journalism club dedicated their yearbook to Maggie's memory. And Sarah, now the keeper of both the town's stories and its secrets, made sure that every new resident learned about the girl who'd chosen truth over safety.



The plaque in the memorial room had been updated with new text:



\*In memory of Margaret ""Maggie"" Whitman, 1940-1957. She chose truth over safety, justice over silence. She was seventeen years old when she disappeared while trying to expose corruption in her town. May we all be so brave. May we all remember that courage isn't the absence of fear—it's doing what's right despite the fear.\*



Sometimes, when Sarah was closing up the library at night, she'd pause in the memorial room and listen. She'd swear she could hear the soft rustle of pages turning, the quiet determination of a girl who'd been willing to risk everything for justice.



And in those moments, she knew that some stories never really end. They just wait, patient and persistent, for someone brave enough to tell them.



\---



\*\*The End\*\*

1ma77h4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1ma77h4/4_small_talk_skills_that_helped_me_survive_office/,4 small talk skills that helped me survive office life after WFH,"After years of WFH, going back to the office felt like landing on another planet. Small talk used to be something I could avoid. Now? It’s at the coffee machine. The elevator. 

Here are skills that helped from [Better Small Talk](https://www.befreed.ai/book/better-small-talk-by-patrick-king)

**1. Preparation is the key**One small trick I learned: prep 2–3 casual topics in advance. It could be something I watched, weekend plans, a local event. When my brain goes blank, I have something to fall back on.

2. **The 1:1:1 Method** This one saved me during awkward moments: • Say hi to **1 person** • Ask **1 question** (e.g., “Any fun weekend plans?”) • Share **1 thing** (e.g., “I’m trying to survive Monday without caffeine”) Do it once a day. Low-stakes, high payoff.

**3. Following up matters** 

 If starting a conversation feels hard, try this: don’t start one. Just listen carefully. Pick up something the other person mentioned, and follow up later. That won’t let the conversation die awkwardly either.

**4. Behavior first, comfort second** Waiting until I “feel ready” never worked. And honestly, the silence in those moments? Painful. So I started with just a “Good morning.” That’s it. I stopped overthinking what to say and began treating small talk like a simple greeting, not a performance. Turns out, acting confident is often the first step to actually becoming confident.

If small talk makes your skin crawl, you just need a few tools. I also read [Fine Art of Small Talk](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-fine-art-of-small-talk-by-debra-fine), which gets a deeper understanding of small talk. I highly recommend it if you're trying to rebuild your social muscles post-WFH.

1ma74f3,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1ma74f3/fantome_perfume_review/,FANTOME Perfume review,"🔷Namba 
Sweetened Water chestnuts and a lightly floral wheat field. Smell doesn’t project much. Didn’t get any motor oil or ice cream notes, I think it smells off due to my skin chemistry. 
Dry down: a sweet grass. 

🔷Koschei The Deathless 
Boozey, smells just like fireball 
Cinnamon and woods, pine fur, rosemary, cologne like strength, almost overpowering. not dirty or earthy. 
Dry down: cinnamon stick and cedar wood. Like an old wooden box that had a bunch of cinnamon sticks laying around in it for years. 

🔷Marya Morevna 
Marc Jacobs daisy at first tbh, overwhelming floral sweet chemical. Then amber. Settled into a very light floral with warm amber and a very light green fresh fruity note. Disappointed that I didn’t get any metallic note :( 
Dry down: light floral, subtle honey and subtle fresh green fruit

🔷Baba yaga
A Minty stick of gum, eucalyptus, moss. Something I can’t place but is very addicting? Not sweet. Not earthy. Or fresh really. Just neutral but invigorating 
Dry down: very subtle smoky eucalyptus with moss, very light musky sprinkle

🔷Ivan the fool
Fresh Lemongrass, honeysuckle, not earthy but masculine, extremely subtle non chemical leather smell 
Dry down: subtle leather, subtle oakmoss, still prominent lemongrass, less “bright”, giving a “mature” smell just very….polished and put together. Really loved this one. 

🔷Firebird
Smoke but not charred, Apple, Orange, (not chemical smelling), more fruity than firey/smokey, something slightly savory, very subtle nutmeg/clove smell 
Dry down: faint roasted Apple, prominent campground fire and nutmeg. 

🔷Lyudmila
Scented cleaning item without all of the chemicals, mix of lilac and lemon. The faintest hint of jasmine 
Dry down is the same 

🔷Paimon
Warm, incense, sand, very subtle amber. I’ve never smelled anything so “hot” temperature wise. Loved this. 

🔷Ruslan
very cologney, pine woods and something sweet and warm. Very basic cologne smell, like axe spray or something. 

🔷Solovey
reminds me of honeysuckle, honey, very syrupy at first, some floral. Apparently some notes of violet. No coffee or amber or tobacco to my nose….. dry down definitely has prominent violet 

🔷Vasilisa
delicious. Melony and clean at first, and some sort of floral. Some cucumber and something sweet. Dry down: warm breezy herbs (not cloying) and sweet cream. Strong marigold and sunflower notes after dry down. Leaves me with a feeling of happiness, and sunshine. Very mellow, but projecting  

🔷Coyoacan
bramble and hot dirt, very similar to Paimon but lacks the incense and cleanliness, has a slight cologney edge to it. Absolutely hits all the notes in fantomes description. 

🔷Lymphae
aquatic tank chemicals and pinesol. Dry down: a lighter breezier pinesol. Very odd scent!

🔷Triton
Words can’t describe, not my cup of tea.

🔷Surem
NyQuil Cherry, cough medicine, cherry cough drop, with a barely noticeable note of wood (?very disappointing I wanted to like this so bad. Gotta be skin chemistry striking again) 

🔷Rochester
tobacco and dirt. Would describe as savory. Very subtle tomato.
Dry down: subtle sweet tobacco, dirt, slightly dirty fall leaves after rain. Liked this a lot but the tomato started having too much of a personality by the end of the day.

🔷The Fox sisters
very delicious edible scent but not gourmand it’s sweet and a bit zesty. Prominent cardamom and what smells like sweet cream icing 
Dries down much less sweet, warm and zesty notes become more soft and rounded 

🔷Parlour
incensey wood in a very old historic manor. Definitely the same smell as an old wooden box that has incense stored in it. 
Dry down: rosewood and oud 

🔷Madame d’esperance: The notes do not smell like the description to me. Mix of DR Bronners and Chanel #5. 

🔷Ectoplasm: very strong marshmallow licorice at first and something mildewy 
Dry down: marshmallow prominent, very very subtle mildew (gotta be my skin chemistry)

🔷Mesmer
aquatic, I would not be able to place the notes if I didn’t know, very unique and unusual scent. Cool incense notes (as opposed to spicy or warm). Honestly some sort of kelpy patchouli 
Dry down: like it a little less, has a bit of a cologny edge that settles in

🔷One white crow
musky floral notes that aren’t chemical or sweet, light syrupy note. Honeysuckle and violets.

🔷Not dead, but arisen
very springy/poppy (not the season or flower) scent, zappy? Lime and very subtle cleaning spray 

🔷Tatami
halls lozenge, damp wet straw, smells damp and moldy on me (pain and disappointment, I was really looking forward to this. Definitely my skin chemistry to blame) 

🔷Faun
forest, sprite soda, would describe it as bouncy, dries down slightly sweet and earthy but in a youthful way

🔷Bune
That orange stuff hospitals put on your skin before a shot (alcahol? Sanitized?) but DANK and MURKY and animalistic somehow 

🔷ASTAROTH
opens very sweet, mild floral notes, sort of like a candy, peach and honey, subtle pumpkin. Love this

🔷Duende
somehow aquatic, but also earthy, fresh, it reminds me of the beach, tree sap and benzoin, leans more masculine than androgynous 

My thoughts: I absolutely love this brand, I am blown away by how well done these fragrances are. The stories behind them add such an extra experience and personality to the fragrances. They do floral fragrances so well. Going into this I was not previously a fan of anything floral, leathery, tobaccoey but this brand has changed that for me and made me realize I actually do like those scents! I do want to note I am NOT a professional or seasoned smeller, I went into this as your average Macy’s perfume department isle walker who occasionally gets samples. So my nose is very untrained to detect specific notes that might otherwise be missed. I also know I absolutely have unique skin chemistry because I usually stand the odd one out as smells just smell WAY different on me than what others have reported on themselves. 

And for someone interested in free samples I would love to re-home these as a set to someone who wants them, there’s plenty left in all of them. I will ship it to you for free! Cant afford to ship them out as singles to multiple people. Dm me if you are interested:
