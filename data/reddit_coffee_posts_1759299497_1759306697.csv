You know that low-battery panic around 3 PM, when your phone hits 20% and you haven't even finished the workday? I was living that exact dread every single afternoon. It got to the point where I was mapping my life around power outlets, which felt ridiculous for a device that's supposed to be, you know, mobile.



My turning point was reading about how modern phone batteries, like the one in the iPhone 17, are actually happiest when you keep them between 20% and 80% charge. It turns out that constantly charging to 100% and letting it drain to zero puts more stress on the battery over time. That little fact completely changed my perspective.



So with the 17, I stopped being a slave to the full charge. I'll just top it up for a bit while I'm having my morning coffee or during a focused work session, and then unplug. The battery optimization feature is smart enough to learn your routine, so it won't overcharge if you plug it in overnight. It sounds simple, but this shift—coupled with the phone's genuinely efficient chip—means I'm ending most days with 30% or more left.



It’s a small change in habit, but it’s completely eliminated that low-power anxiety. I finally feel untethered from the charger, and honestly, it's one of those small, quiet upgrades that improves your daily life more than any flashy camera feature ever could.

1nv2cch,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1nv2cch/the_next_rr_but_on_military_grade_steroids_mcrp/,The next RR but on military grade steroids - MCRP (emerging defence robotics),"TLDR: Micropolis ($MCRP) is a Dubai-based robotics company about to finish pilot testing its M2 autonomous police rover at the end of September. The CEO is openly talking about potential orders of 12,000 units at $200k each. Extremely strong ties to the government and are currently partnered with NVIDIA, Dubai Police, Transguard, the Ministry of Interior, Emirates, and more. With Dubai aiming to deploy 200,000 robots over the next decade, catalysts are fast approaching. This is a speculative pre-revenue play with stronger partners that are known for their deep pockets.

Price at the time of writing: $1.42. Will be holding medium to long-term. 


This is the next Richtech Robotics ($RR), but on steroids. Instead of making coffee, Micropolis is positioning itself to be a major defence and security stock. Everything is designed and built in-house in Dubai, including their full tech stack.

It is a Dubai-based robotics company that IPO’d earlier this year. They develop autonomous mobile robots and their security platform Microspot. Their flagship development is the M1/M2 autonomous police patrol vehicles, with additional projects in delivery and surveillance robotics. The immediate catalyst here is the M2 pilot program. In an interview with the CEO (timestamp 9:15 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUCtfshCyq0), he stated that if the pilot is successful, they are expecting potential orders of 12,000 units at around $200,000 each. That’s a potential multibillion-dollar order book. Pilot testing of the M2 wraps up at the end of September, so we should be hearing updates very soon. Also, just a few days ago, the company posted a video of their autonomous rover in action on LinkedIn at the Dubai Police facility, which looks like a strong signal that the pilot is on track. Link here: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/micropolis-robotics_straight-from-the-dubai-police-swat-testing-activity-7377026799848939520-DLRj?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACQ3lgYB1lW2PUXdglh9Tm_1ulePAxsVYdo

Micropolis is plugged directly into the highest levels of the UAE. Partnerships include Dubai Police (a force that famously runs Ferraris and Lamborghinis in its fleet lol), Transguard (the largest defence/security company in the UAE), the Ministry of Interior (responsible for domestic policy, public security, and law enforcement), Dubai’s RTA, The Sustainable City, and even Emirates. On top of that, they’re the first Middle Eastern robotics company accepted into NVIDIA’s Inception program, which gives them access to NVIDIA’s latest AI and robotics tech, expert support, and co-marketing.

Dubai has committed to rolling out 200,000 robots in the next decade across security, logistics, and services. Micropolis is already embedded with the government agencies that will be central to that plan. If the M2 pilot converts into orders, it could flip the switch from pre-revenue to a core player in the Middle East’s defence and robotics industry.",2,1759305876.0,pennystocks,1,1.0,False

1nv2az6,https://i.redd.it/safbkreiigsf1.jpeg,Review #48: Single Cask Nation Westland 9yo,"**The Maker**

As a Brit, American whiskies are synonymous with bourbon. It's what most of us think of whenever the idea is mentioned. Yet such is our ignorance of whisk*e*y, if you asked most of us to name a bourbon we'd probably say Jack Daniels - as controversial as such a claim would be. 

That's because we've heard the word bourbon on TV, and several bottles of JD can be found in just about every bar across the UK - I'd go so far as to say that it's much more common and widely drunk than any Scotch. But the difference is that it's almost always mixed with something. Be it with coke, or something else entirely. 

As a result, the concept of American Single Malt is one which most Brits won't be aware of. Sure if you're reading this you're likely in the small demographic who are, but I'd wager that most whisky drinkers across the UK and wider Europe don't really know what the growing ASM category is: in short it's single malt whisky made in the Scottish style (just malted barley and mostly twice distilled and matured in oak for over three years), but produced in the US.  

Until recent years I'd put myself among them. But for the 2020 US Presidential election my whisky group decided to do an American night, and I got myself a bottle of Westland Peated when most went straight for bourbon. The Westland came third on the night so I was satisfied enough to try them again for the 2024 election. But this time I'd spice it up a little as the whisky was likely to be the best part of the evening.

My focus quickly fell on Single Cask Nation, an American independent bottler which has recently become much more available in the UK and about which I had heard only good things.

SCN was established in 2011 by whisky podcasters and festival organisers Joshua Hatton and Jason Johnstone-Yellin. The model is much like any other independent bottler: buy interesting casks, look after them until they are ready to be bottled, then sell to your niche market. But this time there was the twists of being one of the few out there selling Scotch to the American market exclusively, and doing this through an online membership platform that was built around an existing podcast and festival circuit.

This has proved to be a significant success over the past 15 years to the point where SCN bottles are now widely available outside the US and have a strong reputation for quality. As testament to this the bottle I picked up stated that despite being matured in the US, it was actually bottled in Scotland, which suggests that some expansion or licencing has gone on to make their releases more available here in Europe, rather than shipping over individual whiskies for sale or auction. 

**The Expression**

As mentioned above I've gone for a Westland whisky. Westland is based in Seattle, which if Frasier has taught me anything is full of coffee shops and craft beer hipsters. To be fair to Frasier everything about Westland backs this up. 

Like SCN they were founded in 2011 and are focusing on the 'terroir' of whisky production in the Pacific Northwest - which enjoys a climate that isn't a millions miles from that of Scotland. Building on this, Westland has specialised in bringing forward lesser known and more traditional barley varieties, yeast strains, and wood types to demonstrate the scale of uniqueness those ingredients can bring to a whisky that simply cannot be found anywhere else.

Their goal is to create something which isn't bourbon, and which isn't scotch. Something which is simply Westland and is produced in a way which is sustainable. This extends to their recent attempts to use sustainable local peat sources to replace early efforts which were imported.

On the whole this has proven to be a success with the reputation of Westland building around the world as the years go by. Indeed within my whisky group Westland is the only non-scotch distillery to feature in our top 20 ranking.

This bottle then is a combination of the expertise at both Westland and Single Cask Nation. It was distilled in August 2014 where it was matured until November 2018 in American Oak. Then it spent the next four years and eight months 'finishing' in1st fill Banyuls Barrique from the south-west of France bringing it to a total of nine years maturation. I say 'finishing' as this is what the bottle claims, but when it's around half the maturation time surely a 'double maturation' is more fitting? Banyuls, meanwhile, is a sweet-wine made from Grenache grapes in the south of France, and not something I've seen a great deal of.

Just 198 bottles were released at 49.8% ABV, and as you can tell from the picture is naturally coloured and has not been chill-filtered. This is now well out of stock everywhere, but when available was priced in the region of £90 ($120).

**The Neck Pour**

This is one crazy colour for a whisky. I can't help but laugh at it being described as Irn-Bru in the tasting notes. Initially there are mountains of vanilla, and toasted almond on the nose. This is followed by Christmas spice Yankee Candles (otherwise known as cinnamon, mace, star-anise, clove and nutmeg). This is added to by sweet smelling Icing sugar. What isn't immediately present on the nose in the alcohol, despite nearing 50%. It must be all those sweet spicy notes holding it back.

Sadly the palate does not yet live up to that nose. Instead it's rather flat on arrival, but then the sweet and bitter toasted spices develop before a hefty hit of sweet red wine tannins come in on the finish.

There’s clearly a lot in here to unpack and develop, and I get the strong sense that it needs time to open up. I’m not familiar with the French sweet wine so my natural comparison is the [BB&R M](https://tripletipple.wixsite.com/tripletipple/post/bb-r-williamson-laphroaig-2013-ex-moscatel)[oscatel ](https://tripletipple.wixsite.com/tripletipple/post/bb-r-williamson-laphroaig-2013-ex-moscatel)[matured Laphroaig I reviewed a few months back](https://tripletipple.wixsite.com/tripletipple/post/bb-r-williamson-laphroaig-2013-ex-moscatel). Obviously this lacks the peat but that aside, at least upon opening, this seems to be a much more accessible bottle than that was. But I’m not sure whether I like it yet.

**The Body**

All the above still holds true on the nose but it's now more marzipan than it is toasted almond - I suspect from those sugar notes. It's like those nutty and winter spice flavours have bonded together more over the three months since this was opened.

What is also changing is that the red fruits are asserting there dominance. Now it's very red berry and cherry forward, almost like that lingonberry jam that Ikea sells so much of.

Alongside all this the oak char is also becoming more prominent on the finish. There's definitely more there now. It's nice and growing on me, but still not amazing. 

**Final Thoughts**

This integration of fruit spice has continued over a subsequent six months and the hefty oak char has only grown more. There’s also now lots of leather in here, bitter coffee grains, and even a bit of dark chocolate.

What I hope is clear from this is that this bottle is one which has developed significantly over time and is a very different beast now than it was when opened. It's taken me more than nine months to get into, but it really is quite something now it's fully oxidised and shows that American Single Malt can go pound for pound with scotch at its peak.

Sadly this peak happened long after the 2024 US election where this came a lonely seventh of thirteen. Nonetheless, for me this is where ASM is at its best at the moment. I’ll get some more when the tariff situation has improved under a future administration as I don't see value in supporting an economy out to damage my own.

I recently returned from a 3 week trip to Thailand.  Two weeks in I had not visited a ""special "" massage place or a bar.  Then I was travelling for the last 5 days from Chiang Mai to Mae Kampong.  I had this crazy idea to explore the possibility of having a Thai lady come with me to MK.  I hopped on a Thai dating site and was honest in what I was looking for only fun and good times in MK and I would pay all the expenses.  Many were interested and I selected a couple to ""interview"".  After having coffee with them I made a clear offer to one of them as to what I expected and agreed to pay for her sister to lookafter hr 15 yr old daughter.  Her English was not fantastic (my Thai non existent) but we managed on day one a bit awkwardly including the sleeping arrangement.  By Day 2 we were warming to each other at a rate of knots.  We seemed to understand one another despite the language barrier and our respective maturities helped (I am 70 and she is 52).  I have not had that connection in the bedroom despite my limitations being 70 with anyone ever.  We just gelled and even in understanding her parenting and work situation.  Been there done that!!!

My issue is I am married and my partner and we jhave an  open our marriage at least I was open for the last 12 months .  The rules are that I must be paying for services and not be seen in public.  Strictly speaking I did pay her but was in public although a long way from Australai.  I am reasonably sure she has felt the same...said so .  She has not asked for any money.  Indeed was grateful that I gave her money in the end for her sister and she must have thought I would reneg.  I gave what she asked and a bit more plus bought her a nice jacket.

I have not relt this alive , this connected to someone for a long long time ...if ever.  This woman is hoping I will come back to Thailand next year.  I made no promises.  She understood and has not hassled me at all.  I know any long term relationship is not possible but logic seems to go out the door when the dopomeine hit is so strong.  The language is a barrier to any deep conversation and her financial situation is one I would describe as a struggle.  Is this just a holiday romance or is more possible?

You know that moment around 3 PM when your phone hits 10% and suddenly you're mapping out the nearest outlets like a survivalist? I was there. My old phone's battery was so bad I considered carrying a power bank in my back pocket, which is neither comfortable nor a good look.



My entire relationship with my phone was just low-power mode anxiety. I'd dim the screen to a level where I had to squint, turn off notifications, and basically stop using it as a smart device. It felt like I was rationing supplies on a desert island.



Then I started reading about the iPhone 17's battery tech, and one detail completely changed my perspective. It's not just a bigger battery; they've redesigned the chip to be more efficient during those tiny, background tasks we never think about—like fetching new emails or checking your location for weather updates. Those microseconds of processing add up to hours of drain, and the 17 is apparently a master of micro-efficiency. It’s the phone equivalent of being frugal with your daily coffee spend and suddenly having a vacation fund.



It made me realize my old phone was like leaving a window open while the AC is on, just bleeding power on things I didn't even need. Now, I just use my phone. I don't end my day with a frantic search for a charger, and that small mental relief is honestly the best feature. It’s the freedom of not having to think about it at all.

Everything was going well… until the landlord asked for my LinkedIn.

At first, I laughed. He was serious. He wanted to “check my professional stability.” I had to explain that my headline saying “Trying to survive marketing deadlines one coffee at a time” wasn’t me working in a café.

The funniest part? He scrolled through my endorsements and said, “At least people recommend you. That means you’re reliable.” I couldn’t believe my LinkedIn endorsements were deciding if I could get a flat.

It got me thinking… what if I didn’t have a LinkedIn? Or what if I showed some random profile with 500 connections and fancy titles? Would I have had a better chance?

Honestly, it felt way more like a job interview than renting a flat.

Ladies,

Happy new month and cheers to the start of Q4. 
I am jobless and shooting my shot because I need the help and I desperately need a win so I can come back with a fun testimony!

Currently: I have a Master's degree and about 5 years of experience. I have written reports no one reads and analysing data until Excel starts judging me. My passion is in impact work, specifically the environment and ESG (that's the new acronym for saving the planet while making companies less evil).

I am, by all accounts, employable. And yet... It's a tough time.

It's been 2+ years since I had a paid gig. My CV is so tailored but without that magical ""in-house recommendation,"" my applications seem to vanish into a black hole. People say you should lie but just how much lying can you do?

So, I'm bypassing the algorithm and appealing directly to you.

Here's what I bring to the table

· Academics: A Master's Degree (the fancy, international kind).
· The Experience: Up to 5 years in the development/climate/sustainability space.
· The Skills: I can write a reports, analyse data, make simple maps, impact assessments etc (yes I havethe Nema license). My heart lies in ESG, climate action, and any work that leaves the world better than we found it.
· The Range: From high-level policy to on-ground project support, I can adapt faster than a chameleon in a bag of Skittles.

How you can be my hero🥹

1. Know of any open roles? I am looking in the Impact, Environment, ESG, Sustainability, or Development sectors. Even a ""we might have something in Q1"" whisper would be nice.
2. Willing to do a CV referral? If your company has a referral bonus, I promise to split my first month's coffee budget with you (this is a serious commitment).
3. Can you connect me to someone? A recruiter? A hiring manager in that space? I promise I'm charming and will not embarrass you.
4.  Or even CV revamp because maybe I am the drama.
5. I am willing to relocate.

I'm not just looking for a job; I'm looking to actually use my skills for good again. And it's the last quarter of the year, I could really use a win.

Cute. The tiny bandage on a gaping prompt-injection wound should make no one sleep easier — especially not founders who treat AI agents like obedient interns.

Here’s the gist: researchers found ways to smuggle commands into Gemini’s input (hidden HTML, calendar invites, “context” files) so the model would follow malicious instructions or even execute shell commands through the CLI. Google deployed fixes for the Gemini CLI and warned about invisible prompts, but the core problem isn’t a line of patched code — it’s trust mechanics built into tools that happily consume untrusted content and then try to act on it.

If you build with LLMs and you’re not paranoid, you’re slow. Indie hackers who auto-run code, consultants who let agents triage emails, and founders who greet ‘safe’ defaults with a shrug are the easiest targets. The attack surface: untrusted inputs, implicit tool execution, environment variables leaking secrets, and UX that hides payloads in plain sight.

Practical, cynical survival kit:
- Don’t let agents run arbitrary shell commands. If an agent says “run this,” make it ask a human with context, not “Are you sure?” modal-lite. 
- Sandboxing is non-negotiable. Containers, least-privilege mounts, and blocked egress should be default, not a checkbox.
- Sanitize everything that touches your model. Strip invisible CSS/HTML, don’t let calendar bodies be binary decision-makers, and treat any external content as hostile.
- Secrets out of env: use a secret manager and short-lived tokens; never trust local environment variables on dev machines.
- Monitor egress and instrument for exfil patterns — DNS beacons and odd curl activity are red flags.

This isn’t prophecy; it’s a calendar invite that quietly asks your agent to hand over your API keys while you sip your coffee. Google patched Gemini’s superficial wounds fast — good hygiene — but the disease is the pattern: agents that act on untrusted context. Until the industry treats context provenance and execution safety like hygiene — as essential as HTTPS — every new model will be a new flavor of phishing.

So yes, upgrade the CLI. Also, lock the doors, stop the agent from being the intern who opens them, and maybe — just maybe — stop believing software will only ever do what you intended.",1,1759304601.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,2,1.0,False

1nv1zmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nv1zmy/should_i_let_my_wife_control_our_finances_and/,Should I let my wife control our finances and make all financial decisions?,"Hey fellow Redditors,

Seeking advice about how to move forward after finding out my wife has been lending her family money in the thousands without my knowledge and refuses to let me have a say. 

First, some context. Me (46m) and my wife (44f) both work full time and have been married over 20 years. When we first got together, finances were very stressful for us. Neither of us had any financial support from our families. We dealt with bad credit, payday loans, calls from collection agencies, living paycheck to paycheck. 

After we got married, my wife offered to take over all things related to finances in order to reduce my stress.  We got joint bank accounts and through hard work and discipline, she eventually improved our situation greatly. We have a house, 2 cars, some toys (camping trailer, atv, etc) and take inexpensive vacations with our 3 teenaged kids. 

We aren't rich but I'm happy with what we've achieved. My job provides stable income.  Wife now makes more than me as of last year (this is important later) and gets bonuses. I am still disciplined with spending. Take a lunch to work, make my coffee before leaving the house, avoid spending anything beyond a coffee or cigarettes and ask if it's OK before making any purchases as I still get told periodically to not buy anything so bills don't bounce. She knows what goes in and out of our account, I was blissfully clueless.

Last month, I got hurt in an accident and cant work or go anywhere. Since im home bored, I shopped online. One purchase required an e-transfer. Not wanting to bother my wife at work to do it for me (what i normally do), i would try to do it myself. I downloaded the bank App on my phone. I got everything set up and in navigating the app, started looking at our latest transactions and had so many questions. E transfers every day! Bills I never heard of, money coming and going with a barely positive balance. 

I know it's my fault for being so disconnected but now that I see whats going on, I started digging. We send our 3 kids money multiple times weekly, turns out they buy lunches in town while at school... ok. More than I'd like to spend since we have lunch supplies at home and they have jobs but love my kids and want to provide. Not going to argue that. Way too many amazon/temu payments, holy i dont like it but she's running a household, fine.  What I took issue with were all the e-transfers going to her mom and sister. 

Their names came up so often, I decided to total it up for past 3 months. They owe us about $2500 for that time span alone.  I cant look back any further as I just got the app and fear what that looks like. I asked my wife why we give her family so much money. We paid their vet bill $1500,  gas money $20-80, grocery money $20-100, wedding supplies $20-100 (SIL getting married next year). Although I see some small deposits from them, we end up lending them more money right after. 

I don't mind helping her family. My biggest issue is that when I asked her about it, she became very upset, defensive and gave me an ultimatum. I said i dont mind lending them money but I wouldn't lend any more until they've  paid back what they owe as it's already substantial for us. She responded with 'Either she gets to do what she wants with our money without having to justify anything to me or we go back to having separate accounts and I deal with the bills because she's going to help her family regardless of what i say'. 

She says since she makes more than me, she gets to decide what we do with our money. I have to ask how much gas I can put in the truck every week and made to feel guilty for buying a coffee while she's paying for her mom and sisters gas, groceries and wedding without asking me if its ok or if I need anything.

Part of me feels like I should forget the whole deal but I feel very manipulated and considering getting my own bank account again so I can save money for emergencies or small house projects. But then we have to look at how to divide bills and I'm right back to feeling stressed about finances.

How much would you be willing to pay for a large iced coffee? A latte/mocha/ariangrande whatever you cool kids call it. Ofcourse, a reasonable rate, not 50 rupay, something that you would comfortably want to spend on coffee. A large glass ranges from 800 to even 1400 at some places, but what is your preferred price? (Given its of an ideal standard: taste, kick and richness).

I don't drink coffee from cafés or coffee shops: mainly because I think I make the best coffee at home and to me, coffee is just a means of staying awake. Plus, I boycott the major chains and I would rather spend 800-1200 or whatever the price is on a shawarma from damasco. 
But again, thats just me and I'm a 70 year old baba jee. I want to know what you guys think.

Each second my hand walked through your hair, it would stumble on knots so beautiful I still cherish them to this day.
You were not perfect, you were not the goddess of tales.  

You didn't have wild curls, for me to lose myself in their tangled waves, nor eyes of blue or green to drown in their sea and forests.
Your eyes were brown like the bittersweet warmth of winter coffee.

Your hair was smooth , a touch so gentle it intoxicated. And nothing was lovelier than tracing your hand in that drunken haze.

You were mine and mine alone. I savoured each moment our eyes locked together.

Our coffee has ‘bits’ in it. We don’t have drinking water. I am also the only one in IT here (I’m a junior developer) so I have a lot of work to do already, and on top of that, everybody including the directors drop Excel sheets with financial data to me and expect me to work on it as if I’m an admin, and apparently “if it’s on a computer then it’s IT”. I get paid okay but it’s not worth the amount of work I put in. They click their fingers or say my name (they have been purposefully mispronouncing it since I started, over a year ago) and I then make them all coffee otherwise they don’t shutup about it. They tell me I shouldn’t go out on weekends and that I should work (without pay). They also expect me to work during my paid holidays, which I usually schedule with a script to make it look like I actually did it during the holiday. As a developer, they give me work that they don’t even understand, and can’t explain what they want. I try and do it and they end up telling me my work is shit and that I’m not very good. I occasionally hear homophobic or racial slurs said by the directors. We had somebody working here last year who had a heart attack in the office and they kept joking about it until he left. We have someone else here who constantly says he’s going to jump off a bridge and everybody tells him to shut up. I decided to quit yesterday, and I stated that it was due to mental health issues. The director began to argue with me and say that I’d be worse off staying at home, to which I replied that I’m going to go travelling with some friends for a while and then get back into IT when I’m ready with some of my friends referring me to their companies. He basically laughed, saying that I’m quitting just to go on holiday. He then asked me what I’ll do when I run out of money, to which I responded that I’ve saved up for a few years and that I live with my parents, so I’m fine. I then said I’d prefer to leave as soon as possible, and he said he needs at least 3 days for me to handover, stating that he doesn’t even know what I have to handover. He said I’m still working there for the next 3 days, so I still have all the work I have due and on top of that this handover which I’ll have to figure out myself. The work I’m doing this week is an impossible report (impossible because we literally don’t have the data, but the director doesn’t understand that even when I keep telling him, he comes in every 5 minutes and asks if it’s done yet). I then have been collecting all the junk in the office and putting it on a pile, have to take photos and send it to an IT disposal company and ask for how much it’ll cost to get rid of it all. It’s not really the developer work I was told I’d be doing and I have to hurry up with it before I leave. Now it’s going to be awkward in the office and much more toxic for the next three days. I’ve been stressing out over telling them I want to quit and then they belittle me and give me more work, like wtf? What do I do for the next three days? I already have all my account login details written down for them, have my office keys on my desk for them, my work laptop in the office too.

TLDR:
What do I even handover when they don’t know themselves? I have all the account details that I use, my work laptop and office keys ready for them to take, but they want me to stay 3 more days, for what?",3,1759304230.0,smallbusiness,9,1.0,False

I thought it would get better , came to a new country no more shitty, strict schools and generally pretty nice people and I’m finally with my family, Ive been 6 years(since 8 now 14) away from my mother lived with my grandparents my father died and she got married in another country, didn’t tell me till she got pregnant i was still young and it hurt that everyone but me, her daughter knew however i found out the man also has a son and divorced, my grandparents weren’t extremely poor but we were middle class i went to a terrible school for years and i always hated being a girl, i hate the fact that i have no choice over anything, i feel extremely uncomfortable with myself till now i started sh at 9-10 because of that i always told my mom over text that i don’t feel okay, something’s wrong i hate myself a bit too much for it to be normal, she would downplay it or dismiss it even normalize it, for years thats what she did my grandparents were always so disappointed with my grades, always mad at me because i didn’t want to go to school i constantly had suicidal thoughts that went on till i attempted which is now about one year ago and a few months, they realized that like “oh now thats not normal” they took me to psychiatrists and a psychologist always, each time i got a diagnosis different than the other my mom came out of concern for the first time in 5 years i saw her again, but i didn’t feel so comfortable, i even got sent to a speech therapist she told me i have dyslexia but that’s just so not true, i don’t know but I’m pretty convinced i don’t.

All of that happened and now about a month ago i finally live with my mom, step dad and two brothers(4yo and 15yo) got pretty much sexually harassed by my step brother but i didn’t say anything because i couldn’t, i distanced myself and now we barely talk, my step dad went through so much; war, framed and went to prison, from country to country illegally eating just fish he caught from the sea with his son who was about 4-6 at the time, that’s a lot to go through, those are life scarring experiences maybe traumatic maybe memorable and shows how strong he is and how much he survived, what i went through is just a dot next to what they went through, i know that and whenever I’m upset or now that I’m school and don’t want to go because i got threatened with a stick lit on fire which I’m extremely terrified of from some guy i don’t know and despite defending myself i still felt like absolute shit this just happened this Monday, i didn’t go to school yesterday and stayed in my room i went out talked with my mom in the end she just said “it’s not the end of the world” i said “yeah i know” and i didn’t mean to raise my voice but i just got really frustrated it hurt more when she replied with “and?” After i didn’t reply, my stepfather came in my room saying I’m doing too much, I’m ruining the family environment what not and i don’t have the right to do so, while i just wanted to be alone he said at the end “if you love your mom you wouldn’t upset her” he left and i started crying i cut myself after being clean for what feels like a long time to me, he came again talking and talking then and he kept asking me to like go together outside ride my bike or drink coffee with him while i didn’t want to do anything, i just wanted to be alone and forget what happened on Monday, he left and i texted my mom opening up to her again despite everything because last time we talked she told me “if you don’t want to go to school then you should have a reason, of course we would get mad if you don’t want to go and expect us to know what’s going on inside your head.” I told her how i feel, how i don’t wanna go to school for the week and that my stepdad’s words only hurt further she only read the first sentence which was i don’t wanna go to school tomorrow and Thursday she calmly said she didn’t really like it and is unable to continue because it hurts her, she went to her bed and we just exchanged a few words like very normal things and about food because i didn’t eat all day, but when she slept my stepdad came in my room talking about how he understands that I’m upset from the situation and how the teacher didn’t do anything about it and I thought he somewhat understood then he started comparing and showed me photos then asked me “are we upset because of this? No.” i wished for the ground to crack open and swallow me whole then be there with him for a second more.
I text my mom about it once he leaves, she didn’t see them and i fell asleep at 1am woke up 4am and wasn’t able to go back to sleep, at 7am she opens the door peeks in and says good morning like nothings wrong which felt relieving i say it back then she asks if I’m not going, obviously not i say no she gets mad and tells me I’m wasting my life over something pathetic each time something happens i have to get depressed and coop up to myself, after i thought everything’s fine yesterday my step dad doesn’t have to understand but at least her, looks like none though.

Im giving up faster than i did back in that cursed country I won’t name, just one situation or a few actually. I wasn’t expecting something extraordinary i wasn’t expecting an awesome family without a single problem but at least something better, two adults aware and a bit educated unlike my grandparents but it feels worse coming from them, I’m considering ending it a way that there’s no way i could survive not sure how but i don’t know, I’m torn, do i really want them to cry and mourn over me?

But something I noticed recently about myself is that I tend to shy from showing interest in other people.

It probably has to do a lot with low self esteem and overthinking, but everytime I think about doing something nice, maybe asking to go for a coffee or talk about something personal or whatnot, I also can't help but feel the person would just think I'm weird or too forward, or even worse might see it as potential romantic interest, which was never part of my intention. I usually end up not talking to the person that interests me, and sometimes even purposefully not looking towards their direction and trying to keep some sort of distance, just out of sheer anxiety, all of which I believe is the opposite of how to get closer to them.

All of that happened and now about a month ago i finally live with my mom, step dad and two brothers(4yo and 15yo) got pretty much sexually harassed by my step brother but i didn’t say anything because i couldn’t, i distanced myself and now we barely talk, my step dad went through so much; war, framed and went to prison, from country to country illegally eating just fish he caught from the sea with his son who was about 4-6 at the time, that’s a lot to go through, those are life scarring experiences maybe traumatic maybe memorable and shows how strong he is and how much he survived, what i went through is just a dot next to what they went through, i know that and whenever I’m upset or now that I’m school and don’t want to go because i got threatened with a stick lit on fire which I’m extremely terrified of from some guy i don’t know and despite defending myself i still felt like absolute shit this just happened this Monday, i didn’t go to school yesterday and stayed in my room i went out talked with my mom in the end she just said “it’s not the end of the world” i said “yeah i know” and i didn’t mean to raise my voice but i just got really frustrated it hurt more when she replied with “and?” After i didn’t reply, my stepfather came in my room saying I’m doing too much, I’m ruining the family environment what not and i don’t have the right to do so, while i just wanted to be alone he said at the end “if you love your mom you wouldn’t upset her” he left and i started crying i cut myself after being clean for what feels like a long time to me, he came again talking and talking then and he kept asking me to like go together outside ride my bike or drink coffee with him while i didn’t want to do anything, i just wanted to be alone and forget what happened on Monday, he left and i texted my mom opening up to her again despite everything because last time we talked she told me “if you don’t want to go to school then you should have a reason, of course we would get mad if you don’t want to go and expect us to know what’s going on inside your head.” I told her how i feel, how i don’t wanna go to school for the week and that my stepdad’s words only hurt further she only read the first sentence which was i don’t wanna go to school tomorrow and Thursday she calmly said she didn’t really like it and is unable to continue because it hurts her, she went to her bed and we just exchanged a few words like very normal things and about food because i didn’t eat all day, but when she slept my stepdad came in my room talking about how he understands that I’m upset from the situation and how the teacher didn’t do anything about it and I thought he somewhat understood then he started comparing and showed me photos then asked me “are we upset because of this? No.” i wished for the ground to crack open and swallow me whole then be there with him for a second more.
I text my mom about it once he leaves, she didn’t see them and i fell asleep at 1am woke up 4am and wasn’t able to go back to sleep, at 7am she opens the door peeks in and says good morning like nothings wrong which felt relieving i say it back then she asks if I’m not going, obviously not i say no she gets mad and tells me I’m wasting my life over something pathetic each time something happens i have to get depressed and coop up to myself, after i thought everything’s fine yesterday my step dad doesn’t have to understand but at least her, looks like none though.

Im giving up faster than i did back in that cursed country I won’t name, just one situation or a few actually. I wasn’t expecting something extraordinary i wasn’t expecting an awesome family without a single problem but at least something better, two adults aware and a bit educated unlike my grandparents but it feels worse coming from them, I’m considering ending it a way that there’s no way i could survive not sure how but i don’t know, I’m torn, do i really want them to cry and mourn over me? Do i want my mom to call her father and mother tell them i ended it and I’m gone? That’d hurt more than burning in hell itself.",1,1759304023.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Recently I texted a girl from 10th grade and we had some coffee at the lunch break. We talked about our exes and stuff and even if she looked interested at first, when we brought up the ex stuff she told me she had a boyfriend the whole 9th grade and its been 3 months since they broke up. She told me she was the one who broke up so I thought she was already over and it wouldn't be a problem for her to get attracted to new people, like me.  Well after that date's evening we texted and she was acting like we were only going to be friends, and told me she wouldn't date someone from the school again. I didn't break the act and kept the friend status, but my intentions weren't that way so I didn't text her again. Well, not texting were maybe normal but I am completely ignoring her at school now, not saying hi or anything. I think she turned around a couple times to say hi to me but I went past her with complete ignorance. And recently I went to our school counselor (which is really close to students) for something irrelevant,  and I saw her and her friends talking to the counselor. Danggg, when I saw that I told the counselor I would come later and just closed the door. The weird part is, when I closed the door her friends started screaming like they are in a concert lol. like I was the only person that wasn't expected there. Now I don't have any idea if she is interested or anything, and because I am the one who showed my interest first now I am waiting a text from her, but I kinda know that she is a shy person and probably wouldn't.

I’d wake up scrolling in bed, lose an hour before even getting up, and somehow still end up on it for 7+ hours a day and literally I didn’t even remember half the stuff I opened it for.

Then I saw my screen time 21 hours in 3 days. That was a wake-up call. I started making small changes: putting distracting apps in a folder called **Do You Really Need This?**, turning my phone to **grayscale**, leaving it in **another room** while working, and limiting social media to just 15 minutes a day.

What really helped, though, was also taking help of tools, tried a few but ended up sticking with Google Calendar to block my time, Notion to keep my priorities in check, and Jolt (screen time) for its focus sessions, made it way easier to actually get work done instead of endlessly scrolling. And not saying to only rely on the productivity tools or sum but you also gotta make some lifestyle changes and pairing that with small morning habits like journaling or making coffee instead of reaching for my phone, it will give you back hours in my day and made mornings feel a lot calmer.

It’s been three weeks and my screen time is down to around 2.5–3 hours. I’m reading more, feel calmer, and actually notice how much free time I have now. It wasn’t easy at first, but starting small made all the difference.",16,1759303671.0,GetMotivated,9,0.94,False
1nv1sh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nv1sh0/rf_they_followed_me_everywhere/,[RF] They followed me everywhere,"Mine is a cautionary tale. One that I'm reliving for the benefit of everyone out there. Did you know that stress is one of the biggest killers of men under 40? I did, and I should have paid more attention to that. But I wanted more in my life. I'd done pretty well for myself, I'd been blessed with intelligence and had put it to good use over the years, working my way up through the company to secure a great job. I worked hard and had a good income. I lived in a nice house in a quiet and safe area of town, great friends and drove my dream car. I was comfortable and had pretty much everything I ever dreamed of, but I wanted more.

That's an unfortunate part of the human condition: we're never satisfied with what we have. We strive for better, bigger, more expensive - just more. And I was no different. I didn't recognise how fortunate I was. I never took the time to look around and actually see what I'd achieved. I wanted to grab everything with both hands. So when a new vacancy came up within the company, a more senior position which paid almost double my already handsome salary, I jumped at the opportunity.

I applied that very same day and sailed through the interview process. I was a hit with all the big wigs and they offered me the job. I started immediately. But with a bigger salary comes more responsibility, and with that comes the stress. Now, I was prepared for the added stress - or at least I thought I was - until the voices started.

I know what you're thinking - I'm crazy right? That's what I started to tell myself, especially since nobody else ever heard the voices . That was my first line of defence: dismiss it, minimise it, explain it away. I tried to rationalise that maybe I was just overhearing snippets of conversations - neighbours, people outside, something on the TV playing in the background - and in my tired state, I attributed it to something more sinister. But the thing that made it harder to ignore was that the voices were always the same.

Three of them stood out. Others came and went, like background chatter bleeding through a wall, but these three were consistent, familiar, and impossible to write off as coincidence. I started calling them by names. Now don't go thinking that naming them meant I was comforted by their presence - quite the opposite. They terrified me. But giving them names made them feel smaller somehow, something I could get a get a handle on instead of something lurking in the dark corners of my mind.

There was Moira, a woman's voice - youngish, sharp, the most aggressive of the three. She never threatened me outright, but the way she spoke... it seethed. Anger, frustration, sometimes even heartbreak. She unsettled me in ways I still can't describe.

The second voice was the least frightening, though no less strange: a little boy I called Max. Max only ever wanted to play. He sounded young - six, maybe seven - and there was a loneliness in his tone that made my chest tighten. He didn't scare me the way Moira did. If anything, I felt sorry for him. The feeling he gave me wasn't dread, but sadness - like he was waiting for someone who'd forgotten him.

The last voice was the one that truly unnerved me. Have you ever been alone in a house and heard a child crying? I don't mean a sniffle or a whine, but real guttural, heart-breaking howling - the kind that rattles your nerves and makes you want to run even if you don't know why. That was her. I called her Bella. She never spoke actual words, just cried and cried, and no amount of talking or ignoring or logic could make it stop. I could be making coffee, brushing my teeth, answering emails at work - it didn't matter. She was there, waiting somewhere just out of sight.

I began to wonder if this was how schizophrenia began, or dissociative identity disorder - some fracture in the mind that started small and then split open. But the more I listened, the more I noticed: they didn't sound like they were coming from inside my head.

They sounded... around me. Behind me. Across the room. Sometimes right next to my ear. That was when the ghost theory crept in. Ridiculous as it sounds, it made a certain kind of sense in the moment. I started thinking of them as my own personal hauntings - spirits that had latched onto me somehow, I found myself talking to them out loud, asking questions into an empty room like an idiot.

""What do you want?"" I remember shouting out one night when Bella's crying had gone on for what felt like hours. Max didn't answer beyond a plaintive ""Play with me?"" in his usual questioning tone. Bella just howled, inconsolable as ever. But Moira? She often replied. ""I want you to see me."" she'd replied once, her voice low and shaking with rage. I remember standing in the kitchen, scanning every corner as if she might flicker into view.

""Then show yourself"" I said. ""I'm right here!"" she snapped back, almost offended. Other times she muttered things I brushed off without much thought back then. ""You're not listening."" ""You're not hearing me."" ""You ignore everything."" When I tried to engage, she got angrier, like I was doing something wrong without knowing what. It was only during the dead of night that the voices ceased. Strange right? Not that that ruled out the ghost theory, but I thought those things were supposed to be more active at night. Sometimes, just as I was falling asleep, I'd feel the mattress shift beside me. The faint impression of weight, like someone was lying down. Once or twice, I even heard a soft ""Goodnight"", barely more than a breath. By the time I opened my eyes, there was no one there. Moments like that bolstered the ghost theory. It was easier than confronting the possibility that my mind was splintering. But I never saw her, never saw any of them, so I lived with them.

My personal ghosts, I called them in my head. Strange how I found that easier to accept than the possibility my mind was slipping. I really did think that's what they were - ghosts - but the truth was worse.

Eventually I made an appointment with my GP. I chalked it up to stress, overwork, exhaustion - whatever label made it sound temporary and fixable. When I really thought about it, the voices had begun around the time I took the new job, around six months earlier. New role, longer hours, heavier workload. Logical connection, right? My doctor seemed to think so. He told me I needed to take some time off work. Get out more. See my family. Relax my brain. See the world. Step away from the social bubble and digital noise. Live in the real world for a while he said. I nodded like I understood, but I didn't really take it the way he meant it. I honestly don't think you would have either, not then.

So I did what he said - sort of. I booked two weeks off. I didn't go travelling; holidays cost too much and I'm more of a homebody. My family? We weren't close. Instead, I saw friends, treated myself to a bit of retail therapy, read books, listened to music and stayed up late watching movies instead of catching up on work. It all sounded healthy enough in my head. No work, no deadlines, no stress. That was the plan. And for a moment I thought I'd cracked it. No voices, right? Wrong. If anything, they got worse. Louder, more persistent. More certain I was supposed to be paying attention to them. I found myself longing to get back to work - anything so I could drown them out a little.

And then there were the times I felt I was living my life like anyone else. Meeting friends, having a laugh, maybe a pint or two. I remember one evening especially. A few mates were joking about their week, someone passed around photos from a recent holiday, someone else telling a story I barely listened to as I slowly consumed more and more alcohol, my head beginning to get fuzzy. A woman caught my eye - pretty, sharp witted. We chatted. A bit of harmless flirting. She laughed at something I said and I felt that old spark of validation. I took her number, but I didn't really intend to see her again. She was just a distraction. Somewhere in the back of my hazy mind, I think Moira muttered something. Nothing outright, nothing you'd notice if you weren't listening for her, and I was always listening. A low, irritated ""Unbelievable,"" or something similar. I brushed it off. Habit, by then.

It had seemed like a normal night out with friends. But it wasn't. I wasn't even dressed to leave the house.

The weekly food shop was the same. I was pushing a trolley down an aisle, comparing prices, being practical. I remember hovering over a head of broccoli, debating whether I'd actually cook it this time. That's when Max piped up: ""I don't like that."" This wasn't his usual ""Play with me?"" and it caught me off-guard. Without thinking, I asked him what he did like. Junk food, of course - crisps, biscuits, the kind of thing any kid would go for. And my mind jumped to the id, ego and superego. I'd studied psychology at college and knew a little on the subject. Was this my id begging to be indulged? The child part of me demanding a say? If so then what the hell was Bella?

I decided to feed the id. The junk went into the trolley. The fruit and vegetables stayed where they belonged - on the shelves. ""Next week,"" I promised myself. ""I'll be healthier next week."" It felt oddly satisfying, like I'd struck a balance between control and surrender. And for a time Max was quiet. Maybe I just had to work out what the other two wanted?

I remember thinking about the voices then - about Moira, Max, and Bella. Were they all parts of me? Ghosts? Hallucinations? I wasn't a hardened sceptic, and I wasn't a blind believer. If they were spirits, they hadn't harmed me. Scared me, sure. But hurt me? No. I figured I could live with them.

Only I wasn't in a supermarket. I was scrolling through an online grocery app. Strange how our minds can play trick like that isn't it? How easily we misremember.

And then, just as suddenly as the had begun, the voices stopped. Two weeks ago, they simply... vanished. Moira's barbed remarks, Max's soft pleas, Bella's endless wailing - gone. I still heard the occasional unfamiliar voice, faint as static, but the main three had disappeared. At first I was elated. The silence was bliss. No more crying from nowhere, no more shadows of conversations lurking just behind my thoughts. That crawling unease that had lived under my skin for months finally eased.

But it didn't take long for the quiet to turn on me. I hadn't realised how used to their presence I'd become. They'd been unsettling, yes, but they'd also been company. Without them, the world felt hollow. Empty. I felt alone in a way I couldn't justify, like something vital had been scooped out of me. Loneliness is a strange thing. You can ignore it when there's noise - when something's filling the gaps. But when the gaps widen, you start to notice the cold.

I made another appointment to see my GP. This feeling wasn't right, it wasn't good and I didn't understand it. And then three days ago, the silence broke - but not in the way I expected. I heard crying again. Bella. I knew that cry immediately, it was carved into my nerves like a groove in brick. For a second I, froze. I couldn't tell where the sound was coming from. Then came Max ""Play with me."" He sounded closer than ever, and I felt an odd rush of excitement. And then - her. Moira. Except she didn't sound angry this time.

""We need to talk,"" she said. Not a shout. Not a snap. Just tired.

It was like the thin membrane between their world and mine stretched, then tore. Vision isn't the right word for what came next. It was more like remembering something I'd never let myself consciously know.

I saw the. Not ghosts. Not figments of my fractured imagination. My family.

A woman sitting at the end of a sofa, face drawn with exhaustion, phone in her hand. A little boy with a tablet abandoned beside him, clutching a bright red toy car, his eyes red from crying. And a baby - my baby - strapped into her high chair, cheeks blotchy, mouth wide in an endless wail.

The room wasn't unfamiliar. It was my living room. The wallpaper we'd chosen together. The blanket she loved draped over the arm of the couch. The dent in the carpet where the coffee table had been before we moved it to make room for a playmat.

And then the most horrifying part: me

I was there in the memory - no, in the truth - sitting in the same room but not *in* it. Laptop open. Headphones on. Phone buzzing with notifications. I wasn't looking at them. I hadn't been looking at them for a long time. They weren't ghosts - I made them ghosts. I pushed them out of my world until all I hear of them were echoes. And now they were gone.

That's when the doorbell rang in the present. I flinched, my heart hammering. It was a delivery driver with a parcel I don't remember ordering. Once I'd signed for it and closed the door I saw the envelope again on my desk. The divorce papers. My name. Her name. Custody terms. Mediation dates. Agreements I had supposedly read. My own signature printed digitally at the bottom from weeks ago. I sat down slowly, my phone still in my hand. I didn't even remember picking it up. The doctor was still talking through the screen, his voice muffled by the ringing in my ears.

""You need to rest,"" he said. ""And support is important right now. Antidepressants can help balance your thinking so you can face what's happening. You can't undo it by pretending it isn't real. I know it'd hard, but you have to face up to reality.""

I don't remember hanging up, but suddenly the call was over. The silence in the room felt huge. My fingers loosened around the phone and it dropped onto the desk with a dull clack.

That's when I heard it.

Music, faint but unmistakable, coming from a playlist I must have left running on the smart speaker behind me.

""***Don't it always seem to go,***

***that you don't know what you got 'til it's gone***...""

""Big yellow taxi"" Joni Mitchell's voice floated through the air like a verdict.

I closed my eyes

My wife - Moira. Not her real name, but the name I'd given to the anger in her voice when she begged me to pay attention. When she said she was right there.

My son - Max. The little boy who wanted to play. Who asked and asked over and over until he stopped asking altogether.

My daughter - Bella. The teething baby whose only language was crying. Who didn't understand why daddy wouldn't look at her.

They were never ghosts. They were never hallucinations. They were moments and memories and pleas filtered through a man who lived more online than in his own house.

They didn't leave because of the stress. They left because of me.

Isn't it funny how your mind can play tricks on you?

So this is my cautionary tale. Not really one of stress - we all have stresses. It's how we respond to it that matters. I urge you to put down your phone, your tablet, close your laptop and engage with the world. Play with your kids. Make memories with them that none of you will ever forget. Spend time in nature, appreciate the beauty around you. Spend time with friends, and talk with them, really talk with them. Sit with your spouse, laugh and be present.

Put down the devices and make time for what's truly important. You can never get that time back.

Follow my advice, and you can have everything you ever dreamed of.

But **poor quality sleep** can silently affect your mood, weight, and energy.  
Here are **6 warning signs** that your body isn’t getting the rest it needs:

# 1. You wake up tired despite a full night’s sleep

If you need **multiple alarms** or feel groggy every morning, it could mean your sleep cycles are disrupted.

# 2. You crave sugar or caffeine often

Lack of proper rest increases **cravings for sugary snacks and coffee** because your body seeks quick energy boosts.

# 3. Your skin looks dull or you get frequent breakouts

Good sleep is when your skin repairs itself. Poor sleep can lead to **dull skin, puffiness, or acne flare-ups.**

# 4. You’re more irritable or forgetful

Sleep affects your brain’s ability to process emotions and memory.  
If you’re **snapping at people** or forgetting simple things, your sleep quality might be to blame.

# 5. You fall sick more often

A weak immune system is one of the first signs of **chronic sleep deprivation.**

# 6. You can’t focus for long periods

Struggling to **stay alert during meetings or study sessions** is a common sign of insufficient deep sleep.

💡 **Simple Fixes to Try Tonight:**

* Stick to a fixed bedtime (even on weekends)
* Avoid phone screens 30 minutes before sleep
* Keep your room cool, dark, and quiet
* Avoid heavy meals or caffeine late in the evening

# OR AM I?



# Abstract

A concise investigation into the meta-probabilistic stability of being wrong, the phenomenology of confident misperception, and the thermodynamic consequences of admitting uncertainty. Using thought experiments, questionable instrumentation, and a retrofitted paradox engine, this dossier demonstrates that sometimes being “not frong” is a measurable state, and sometimes it is a very convincing illusion.

# Introduction

* **Problem statement**: People frequently assert facts with high confidence. Confidence appears to correlate with perceived correctness, but does it cause correctness, follow it, or merely cosplay it?
* **Working hypothesis**: There exists a spectrum between “not frong” and “definitely frong” that can be mapped, quantified, and—under very specific laboratory conditions—oscillated.

# Key definitions

* **Frongness**: A unitless scalar representing the mismatch between a belief and empirical reality as assessed by a neutral observer instrument called the Sensus Contrapositron.
* **Not Frong**: The local minimum on the frongness curve where subjective confidence, peer reinforcement, and selective observation create a stable but potentially false equilibrium.
* **Meta-Notion Drift**: Slow temporal change of an individual’s threshold for admitting error, measured in contrition units per calendar year.

# Methods and apparatus

* **The Paradox Engine**: A thought experiment device that feeds a proposition into an ever-reflecting feedback loop of ""But what if..."" until the proposition either collapses into contradiction or settles into beautiful ambiguity.
* **Sensus Contrapositron**: An imaginary sensor that outputs a spectral readout from ""Certain"" through ""Plausible"" to ""Spectacularly Wrong"". Calibration uses 37 cups of coffee, two debates, and a random Reddit thread.
* **Double-Blind Reality Check**: Observers are shown a bold claim and either experimental truth or a theatrically staged counterexample; observer conviction is recorded before and after exposure.

# Observations

* Confident-but-wrong claims show a fractal stability: they are resistant to one-off counterevidence but break down quickly under patterned contradiction.
* The Paradox Engine sometimes returns to a previously rejected claim with greater plausibility after three cycles of meta-questioning, demonstrating hysteresis in belief systems.
* Sensus Contrapositron readings correlate with group size: larger groups report lower frongness even when measured outcomes are identical.

# Representative experiments

1. **The Coin That Remembers**
   * Procedure: Flip a coin 1,000 times while telling it what the result should be.
   * Result: No change in physical distribution; observers who believed the coin remembered reported more consistent sequences.
   * Conclusion: Observer narrative scaffolding changes perceived randomness but not statistical outcome.
2. **The Sofa Hypothesis**
   * Procedure: Place three identical sofas in a room labeled True, Maybe, Wrong. Ask visitors to sit on the Truthiest sofa.
   * Result: 73% chose the ‘True’ sofa which had the same cushions as the others. Seating choice showed strong correlation with prior conversational priming.
   * Conclusion: Environmental cues and framing account for large shifts in declared certainty.
3. **The Self-Consuming Assertion**
   * Procedure: Publish a claim that ""This claim is 90% likely to be false."" Track repost rate.
   * Result: Reposts increased; perceived credibility paradoxically rose among a subset who liked meta-confident self-doubt.
   * Conclusion: A performance of doubt can function as a new form of persuasive armor.

# Results synthesis

* **Behavioral law of not-frong**: For any claim C and audience A, perceived frongness F decreases as the ratio of rhetorical flair to empirical evidence increases. The relationship is nonlinear and occasionally spikes when empirical surprises occur.
* **Entropy of Admission Principle**: The energy cost to shift an individual's frongness by one contrition unit is proportional to the square of their prior rhetorical investment. Shortcuts exist: rituals, public confessions, and the strategic use of memes provide lower-energy pathways.
* **Social reinforcement loop**: Echo chambers create local minima of not-frong where falsehoods persist because exiting would require cognitive expeditions across uncomfortable terrain.

# Discussion

* Being “not frong” is performative, social, and sometimes adaptive. Quick, confident errors can be evolutionarily useful in low-risk environments where speed trumps accuracy.
* The act of calling someone out on frongness must balance informational correction with the thermodynamic cost of social discomfort. Too much energy expended and the system freezes; too little and false equilibria persist.
* The paradox engine suggests that iterative questioning can both destabilize and accidentally re-stabilize errors, depending on narrative architecture.

# Practical implications

* When you suspect a belief is frong: request a patterned contradiction, not a single counterexample. Patterned contradictions are the hydrogen bombs of false beliefs.
* To reduce your own frongness: implement a ritual of ""public micro-fails""—small, safe admissions that lower the energy barrier to larger corrections.
* For educators and communicators: design evidence sequences that are narrative-friendly and rhythmically paced to avoid hysteresis traps.

# Closing provocation

If you feel certain now, examine the scaffolding of that certainty. If you doubt, sit in the discomfort for exactly 37 seconds. After that, either you will be less frong, or the universe will have politely adjusted to accommodate your new uncertainty.",1,1759303314.0,nonsense,0,1.0,False

Here are **7 small but powerful habits** you can start today that can make you feel healthier in just a month:

# 1. Start your morning with water

Before coffee or tea, drink **1–2 glasses of plain water**. It helps with digestion, boosts energy, and reduces morning fatigue.

# 2. Walk after meals

A **5–10 minute walk** after lunch or dinner improves digestion and helps maintain blood sugar levels.

# 3. Prioritize protein in each meal

Add at least **a fist-sized portion of protein** (like dal, beans, paneer, eggs, or chicken). Protein keeps you full longer and supports muscle health.

# 4. Limit sugary drinks

Replace sodas or packaged juices with **lime water, buttermilk, or unsweetened tea.** This single change can cut hundreds of calories weekly.

# 5. Add one extra serving of veggies

Simply add **one handful of vegetables** (like cucumber, carrots, spinach) to your meals. More fiber = better digestion and immunity.

# 6. Stretch for 5 minutes before bed

Gentle stretching before sleeping improves posture and reduces muscle stiffness — especially if you sit a lot during the day.

# 7. Sleep at the same time every day

Going to bed **30 minutes earlier** consistently can improve your focus, mood, and even weight management.

💡 **Key takeaway:**  
You don’t have to overhaul your life overnight. Focus on small, consistent changes — your body will thank you.",1,1759303308.0,u_PerspectiveFit6976,0,1.0,False

You know how I was always so frustrated trying to take a nice portrait of my dog without the background looking like a messy blur? I’d end up with one ear in focus and the other completely lost. It felt like I needed a professional camera just to get a decent shot.



My friend finally convinced me to just use the portrait mode on my phone, which, okay, felt a bit like cheating. But the trick I learned is all about the light. You have to find soft, natural light, like near a window indoors or in open shade outside. The harsh noon sun creates shadows that are impossible for any camera to fix.



Speaking of the camera, the one on the iPhone 17 is honestly spooky sometimes. It automatically detects not just people, but pets and even objects, and the level of detail it can create is wild. It made me look up how this even works. Apparently, it uses something called a ""LiDAR scanner,"" which is the same technology used in self-driving cars to map their surroundings in 3D. It’s basically firing out invisible laser dots to measure depth, which is why the background blur can look so much more natural than it used to.



Now I’m that person taking photos of my coffee cup just because the bokeh effect looks so pretty. It’s not magic, but it does feel like having a little piece of incredibly smart technology right in your pocket. I finally got a shot of the dog where both of his ears are sharp, and he looks like a distinguished gentleman.

I’ve spent years in the trenches, working with people who are constantly searching for an edge, whether it’s for focus during a demanding work week or for better recall as they age. And invariably, the conversation turns to ""smart herbs."" What are they? Do they actually work? And crucially, are they safe? Let me tell ya, the world of natural cognitive enhancers is a fascinating one, full of both incredible promise and significant pitfalls. It's not about magic pills; it’s about understanding the science, respecting the plant, and above all, prioritising safety.

**What Exactly Are Smart Herbs and Why Do They Matter?**

I get this question constantly. What exactly makes a ""smart herb"" different from, say, a regular kitchen herb?

Essentially, smart herbs are a subset of botanicals often referred to as nootropics. The term ""nootropic"" was coined back in 1972 by a Romanian psychologist and chemist, Corneliu Giurgea, to describe substances that enhance cognitive function without significant side effects. Now, I’ve noticed that people often conflate ""natural"" with ""harmless,"" and that’s a dangerous simplification when we’re talking about powerful compounds. These aren't just garden-variety plants; many of them have very specific mechanisms of action that can influence brain chemistry, blood flow, and even nerve growth.

The reason smart herbs matter so much right now is simple: our brains are under constant assault. We're bombarded with information, stressed out, sleep-deprived, and trying to juggle a dozen things at once. It's no wonder people are looking for tools to help their brains keep up. But honestly? The trick isn’t just knowing the basics of what they are. You need to understand that their ""smartness"" comes from their ability to modulate specific pathways in the brain. They're not just making you ""smarter"" in some abstract way; they might be improving memory consolidation, enhancing focus, reducing mental fatigue, or even protecting neural pathways from damage.

For example, I've seen clients come in exhausted, feeling mentally sluggish, and convinced they just need more coffee. But often, the real issue is chronic stress impacting their adrenal glands and neurotransmitter balance. That's where an adaptogenic smart herb like [Rhodiola Rosea](https://www.herbalnootropics.life/rhodiola-rosea-benefits) can come into play, helping the body manage stress more effectively, rather than just masking fatigue. It’s a nuanced game, and one that requires a much deeper understanding than just reading a headline.

https://preview.redd.it/15fuazxy8gsf1.jpg?width=728&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=37137035aae0bba90cb7dfc73bcddc089343dc6f

**Key factors to consider when thinking about smart herbs:**

* **Mechanism of Action:** How does the herb actually affect your brain or body? Is it increasing blood flow, acting as an antioxidant, or stimulating nerve growth?
* **Traditional Use:** Many of these herbs have been used for centuries in traditional medicine systems like Ayurveda or Traditional Chinese Medicine, which provides a rich historical context for their potential benefits.
* **Scientific Backing:** While traditional use is valuable, modern science is crucial for understanding efficacy, optimal dosing, and potential risks. This is where we separate folklore from functional support.
* **Holistic Approach:** No herb, no matter how ""smart,"" can magically fix an unhealthy lifestyle. They are best seen as adjuncts to a solid foundation of diet, sleep, and exercise.

Now, you might wonder about the difference between a natural nootropic and a synthetic one? That’s a whole other conversation, but typically, ""smart herbs"" refer specifically to plant-derived compounds, distinguishing them from lab-created substances like piracetam or modafinil. The benefit of herbs, many argue, is their complex synergy of compounds, which some believe offers a more balanced effect.

**How Professionals Approach Smart Herbs: More Than Just Popping a Pill**

When I’m working with someone interested in smart herbs, I always emphasise that it's a strategic, individualised process, not a casual experiment. Professionals—and by that, I mean integrative doctors, qualified herbalists, and nutritionists—don't just recommend a list of herbs. We start with a thorough assessment of an individual’s health, lifestyle, and specific cognitive goals. This isn't just about what you want to achieve, but also what your body needs and what it can safely handle.

For instance, last week, a client asked me about Bacopa Monnieri for memory enhancement. Now, Bacopa is fantastic, with multiple studies showing positive effects, especially for memory and learning capacity. It even helps with cerebral blood flow, which is crucial for brain health. But honestly? Most people miss a critical detail: it must be taken at optimal doses for extended periods—we're talking weeks to months—to see measurable improvement. You can't just take it for a few days and expect a miracle. It works by cumulative effects, like repairing brain cells and acting as an antioxidant.

**Here’s what most people miss when they first dabble in smart herbs:**

* **Dosage and Timing:** This isn't one-size-fits-all. The effective dose for Bacopa will be different from, say, Lion's Mane. And the timing—some herbs are best with food, others on an empty stomach—matters for absorption and impact.
* **Synergy vs. Isolation:** Sometimes, the magic happens when herbs are combined. But other times, combining them can lead to unexpected interactions. An expert understands these subtleties.
* **Patience and Consistency:** Unlike a stimulant, most smart herbs work by supporting underlying physiological processes. This means you need to be patient. I often tell my clients, ""Think of it like tending a garden; you're cultivating brain health, not just spraying a quick fix.""
* **Individual Variability:** What works wonders for one person might do nothing for another, or even cause an adverse reaction. Genetics, gut microbiome, existing health conditions—they all play a role.

The trick isn’t just knowing what herbs are out there. It's understanding how they integrate into a comprehensive health plan. I've noticed that folks often jump to supplements before addressing foundational elements like chronic stress, poor sleep, or nutrient deficiencies. That's putting the cart way before the horse. A professional approach always prioritizes lifestyle first. No supplement, herbal or otherwise, can outperform the brain benefits of a healthy diet, consistent physical activity, quality sleep, and mental stimulation. These are non-negotiables for cognitive health.



# Smart Herbs vs. Traditional Nootropics: A Different Kind of Brain Boost

When we talk about cognitive enhancement, it’s easy to throw everything into the ""nootropic"" bucket. But there’s a distinct difference in how smart herbs operate compared to, say, pharmaceuticals or even synthetic nootropics. It’s not about which is ""better,"" but which is right for a particular goal and individual.

Take Ginkgo Biloba, for example. It’s one of the most extensively studied smart herbs, primarily for its ability to improve brain circulation. This is a crucial benefit because better blood flow means more oxygen and nutrients reaching brain cells. Now, you could argue that certain prescription medications also improve circulation. But Ginkgo does this through a complex array of flavonoids and terpenoids, often with a gentler, more systemic effect compared to a targeted pharmaceutical. The catch? You gotta ensure no interactions with other medications, especially blood thinners. That's a non-negotiable conversation with your doctor.

[Ginkgo ](https://preview.redd.it/ea0q1qdd9gsf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e0f3061a96bde1d3cb398f3bb2aed20f8046ff9)

Here's how I typically frame the comparison:

* **Herbal Nootropics (Smart Herbs):**
   * **Pros:** Often work through multiple pathways (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective), generally considered gentle, cumulative effects, traditional wisdom.
   * **Cons:** Slower acting, variable potency in products, potential for contamination/adulteration, less immediate ""kick.""
   * **Examples:** Bacopa Monnieri, Lion's Mane, Ashwagandha.
* **Synthetic Nootropics (e.g., Piracetam):**
   * **Pros:** Often faster acting, more targeted effects, consistent dosing.
   * **Cons:** Less traditional history, potential for more pronounced side effects, long-term safety not always fully established.
* **Pharmaceuticals (e.g., ADHD meds):**
   * **Pros:** Very potent, specific mechanisms for diagnosed conditions, immediate and strong effects.
   * **Cons:** Significant side effects, addiction potential, prescription required, designed for illness, not general enhancement.

I’ve noticed that people often seek the ""buzz"" of a synthetic nootropic, something they can feel working almost immediately. Smart herbs rarely deliver that kind of immediate sensation. Their strength lies in their subtle, supportive role in optimising long-term brain health and function. Lion's Mane Mushroom, for instance, stimulates nerve growth factor (NGF). This isn’t something you ""feel"" working after an hour. It’s a foundational process that, over weeks and months, can protect against neurodegenerative changes and support overall cognitive vitality.

So, when someone asks me, ""Should I take smart herbs or something else?"" My answer is always: ""What are your goals, what's your health status, and what's your tolerance for risk?"" For general cognitive support, long-term brain health, and a gentler approach, smart herbs are often my first recommendation. But for someone needing an acute, powerful intervention for a diagnosed condition, we'd be looking at a very different toolkit, always under strict medical supervision.

# Choosing the Best Smart Herbs for Your Goals: Beyond the Hype

Okay, so you've done your homework, talked to your doctor, and decided to explore smart herbs. Now the real question: which ones? This isn't just about picking the most popular; it's about aligning the herb's known benefits with your specific cognitive goals and health profile.

**Let's break down some of the top contenders and when I’d typically suggest them:**

# For Memory and Learning Enhancement: Bacopa Monnieri

If your primary concern is improving recall, solidifying new information, or just generally sharpening your memory, [Bacopa Monnieri](https://www.herbalnootropics.life/bacopa-for-memory) is often my go-to. I've seen it work wonders for students during exam periods and for older adults looking to maintain cognitive sharpness. It's unique in its ability to repair brain cells and increase cerebral blood flow, truly nurturing the brain’s infrastructure. But remember what I said earlier: consistency is key here. Think of it as a long-term investment in your brain.

**For Nerve Growth and Brain Protection: Lion's Mane Mushroom**

This is a fascinating one, gaining a lot of traction, and for good reason. Lion's Mane directly stimulates nerve growth factor (NGF), which is essential for the growth, maintenance, and survival of neurons. If you’re thinking about long-term brain health, protecting against age-related cognitive decline, or just wanting to support overall neural plasticity, Lion's Mane is excellent. Early research even suggests it might help reduce anxiety and depression. I always recommend looking for a reputable extract for this one; not all mushroom supplements are created equal.

# For Stress Management and Cognitive Resilience: Ashwagandha & Rhodiola Rosea

These are adaptogens, meaning they help your body adapt to stress. If chronic stress is draining your mental energy, causing brain fog, or making it hard to focus, these herbs can be game-changers. Ashwagandha, revered in Ayurvedic medicine, is a ""Rasayana"" or rejuvenator, studied for its role in cognitive disorders. It has psychoactive properties that come from a synergistic blend of compounds. Rhodiola Rosea, on the other hand, is proposed to help control stress and may improve quality of life and neurological health. Early research is promising, but many studies are still limited.

* **Ashwagandha:** Great if you also struggle with sleep or feel generally ""wired but tired."" Just watch for potential upper GI discomfort or drowsiness.
* **Rhodiola Rosea:** Ideal for mental fatigue, improving focus under pressure, and boosting endurance. Short-term use seems safe, but long-term impacts are less known. You can learn more about its potential benefits here:[ Rhodiola Rosea Benefits ](https://www.herbalnootropics.life/rhodiola-rosea-benefits)

# For Circulation and Alertness: Ginkgo Biloba

For those seeking better brain circulation, which can translate to improved alertness and cognitive function, Ginkgo Biloba is a classic. It’s extensively studied, and research consistently points to its vascular benefits. Again, critical to check for interactions with blood thinners.

# For Neuroprotection and BDNF Support: Cat's Claw

This herb is showing promising early research in increasing neurologic growth factor BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor), which is like Miracle-Gro for your brain cells. It may even inhibit brain plaque and tangles associated with cognitive decline. It's an interesting contender for comprehensive brain health.

When choosing, I often lean towards brands that use standardized extracts, like Gaia Herbs or Nature's Way, because their potency is more consistent. But honestly, always, always consult your doctor first, especially if you're on other medications.

# Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them: Navigating the Wild West of Supplements

Let me be blunt: the herbal supplement world is a bit of a Wild West. Without proper guidance, it's incredibly easy to make mistakes that range from ineffective to downright dangerous. I’ve seen it all, and my goal is to help you avoid those common pitfalls.

The biggest mistake? Assuming ""natural"" means ""safe."" This is a huge misconception that can lead to serious health issues. In the United States, herbal supplements are not regulated like prescription drugs. The FDA doesn't evaluate them for safety or effectiveness before they're sold. They're essentially considered ""safe until proven unsafe,"" which is a stark contrast to how pharmaceuticals are rigorously tested. This regulatory gap creates a minefield for the unsuspecting consumer.

Here are the most common mistakes I've encountered and my practical advice on how to sidestep them:

1. **Ignoring the ""Lax Regulation"" Reality:**
   * **Pitfall:** Believing all supplements on the shelf are rigorously tested and approved.
   * **Solution:** Understand that the burden of proof is on the consumer. This means you need to be extra diligent. Look for third-party certifications like **USP (United States Pharmacopeia)**, NSF International, or ConsumerLab. These seals indicate that an independent body has verified the product contains what it says it does, in the amounts specified, and is free from harmful contaminants.
2. **Overlooking Contamination and Adulteration Risks:**
   * **Pitfall:** Assuming the label is always accurate and the product is pure.
   * **Solution:** Studies have unfortunately found that some supplements contain ingredients not listed, or are contaminated with heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead), or even undisclosed prescription drugs. Always choose reputable brands with a transparent manufacturing process. If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. I’m always wary of obscure brands making outlandish claims.
3. **Neglecting Potential Drug Interactions:**
   * **Pitfall:** Taking an herb without considering its interaction with prescription medications. This is probably the most dangerous mistake I see.
   * **Solution:** **ALWAYS consult your doctor before starting any new herbal supplement.** Herbal supplements can interact with prescription medications, making them less effective or increasing side effects. St. John's Wort, for instance, has an extensive list of dangerous drug interactions. Turmeric can reduce the effectiveness of chemotherapy. These interactions aren't minor; they can be life-threatening. This also includes interactions with underlying health conditions like liver or kidney disease.
4. **Disregarding Specific Population Risks:**
   * **Pitfall:** Believing smart herbs are universally safe for everyone.
   * **Solution:** Certain groups are at higher risk. If you are pregnant, breastfeeding, taking any prescription medications (especially for heart conditions, blood pressure, or blood thinning), have autoimmune disorders, high/low blood pressure, stomach ulcers, or diabetes, or are scheduled for surgery, **you absolutely MUST consult a doctor first.** Your body's chemistry is delicate, and these herbs are powerful.
5. **Expecting Instant Miracles:**
   * **Pitfall:** Taking an herb for a few days and then giving up because you don't ""feel"" anything.
   * **Solution:** Many smart herbs work cumulatively and subtly. They're not stimulants. Give them time—often weeks or even months—to exert their full effects. And remember, the goal isn't always a dramatic ""feeling,"" but rather improved underlying brain function and resilience.

In my experience, the folks who get the best results from smart herbs are those who approach them with respect, patience, and a healthy dose of skepticism, always guided by professional advice.

# Advanced Tips & Insider Knowledge for Optimizing Smart Herb Use

Alright, for those of you who’ve gone through the safety checks, consulted your doctor, and are serious about optimizing your cognitive performance with smart herbs, let’s talk about some next-level strategies. This isn’t stuff you’ll find in a generic blog post; this is what I’ve learned from years of practical application and staying current with the cutting edge.

# 1. Cycle Your Herbs for Maximum Efficacy

One of the biggest insider tips? Don't just take the same herb day in and day out, indefinitely. Our bodies can adapt, and sometimes the efficacy can diminish over time. I’ve noticed that cycling smart herbs can prevent tolerance build-up and enhance their long-term benefits.

* **How I do it:** For something like Rhodiola Rosea or Ashwagandha, which are adaptogens, I often suggest a 6-8 week on, 2-4 week off cycle. This gives your body a chance to reset and ensures the herb remains impactful when you reintroduce it.
* **Why it works:** It’s like exercise. You wouldn't do the same workout every single day for years and expect continuous gains. Your body needs variation, periods of rest, and different stimuli. The same goes for how your brain responds to these compounds.

# 2. Microdosing for Enhanced Sensitivity

While clinical trials often focus on specific, higher doses, I’ve seen some interesting results with what I call ""strategic microdosing"" for certain individuals. This isn't about hallucinogenics; it's about taking very low, sub-threshold doses to potentially enhance the body's sensitivity to the herb over time, especially for highly sensitive individuals.

* **Example:** For some clients, a full recommended dose of Lion's Mane might be too much initially. Starting with half or even a quarter of the suggested dose, and slowly titrating up, allows the body to gently acclimate. This is a very individualized approach and always done with extreme caution.

# 3. Understanding Bioavailability Enhancers

Even the best herb won't work if your body can't absorb it. This is where bioavailability comes in. Some smart herbs benefit immensely from being taken with certain co-factors.

* **Fats:** Many fat-soluble compounds in herbs (like the bacosides in Bacopa Monnieri) are better absorbed when taken with a healthy fat source. I often suggest taking them with a meal that includes avocado, nuts, seeds, or a drizzle of olive oil.
* **Piperine (Black Pepper Extract):** This compound, often found in formulations with turmeric, can significantly enhance the absorption of many herbal compounds by inhibiting certain metabolic enzymes. While not universally applicable, it's a powerful tool for some.

# 4. Genetic Predisposition and Personalized Responses

This is where things get really advanced. As our understanding of nutrigenomics grows, we’re learning that an individual’s genetic makeup can influence how they respond to various compounds, including smart herbs.

* **Example:** Some people have variations in genes that affect neurotransmitter metabolism or detoxification pathways. These variations can mean they respond very differently to an herb than someone else. While full genetic testing for herb response is still emerging, being aware of this helps us understand why an herb might work wonders for one person and do nothing for another. It adds another layer to the ""individual variability"" I mentioned earlier.

# 5. Synergy, Not Just Addition

Mixing herbs isn't just about throwing a bunch together. It’s about creating intelligent synergistic blends where the compounds work better together than they do alone. This is an art as much as a science.

* **Classic example:** The combination of Ashwagandha and Bacopa Monnieri is often used in Ayurvedic traditions to support overall cognitive and stress resilience. They target different, yet complementary, pathways. Ashwagandha addresses the stress response, while Bacopa focuses on memory. This kind of thoughtful pairing can often lead to more profound and balanced benefits.

The key takeaway for advanced use? It’s about being a strategic investigator of your own health, armed with knowledge and always, always guided by expert consultation. Don't go it alone when you're delving into these powerful plant allies.

# Real-World Applications: Who Benefits Most from Smart Herbs?

It’s one thing to talk about the science, but it's another to see these concepts play out in real life. I’ve worked with a diverse group of individuals who’ve integrated smart herbs into their routines, and their experiences often highlight the true power—and limitations—of these botanicals.

# The Overworked Professional: Finding Focus Amidst the Chaos

Last month, a client, a marketing executive named Sarah, came to me completely overwhelmed. Juggling multiple projects, she felt mentally foggy, struggled with recall during presentations, and couldn’t maintain focus for more than an hour at a time. After a thorough health assessment, we identified chronic stress and mild nutrient deficiencies as key contributors.

* **Her Protocol:** We started with foundational lifestyle changes—optimizing sleep, incorporating meditation, and improving her diet. Then, we introduced a blend that included **Ashwagandha** to help manage her stress response and [Lion's Mane Mushroom](https://www.herbalnootropics.life/lions-mane-benefits) for neuroprotective and cognitive support. We chose a third-party tested brand of Lion's Mane to ensure purity.
* **The Outcome:** After about 8 weeks, Sarah reported a significant reduction in her ""brain fog."" Her focus improved, and she felt less overwhelmed. She wasn't suddenly a genius, but she felt more resilient and mentally clear. The Ashwagandha helped her sleep better, which in turn amplified the cognitive benefits. She continues to cycle her herbs and prioritize her lifestyle.

# The Student Seeking an Edge: Memory & Learning Support

I often get students in their late teens or early twenties, feeling immense pressure during exam periods. They're usually sleep-deprived and living on caffeine. While I always push for better sleep and nutrition, smart herbs can provide a gentle, supportive boost.

* **Their Protocol:** For a student focusing on memory and learning, I usually recommend **Bacopa Monnieri**. I specifically emphasize the importance of starting it well before the exam period—at least 2-3 months prior—because of its cumulative effects. We discuss how Bacopa improves learning capacity and memory recall, and I advise taking it with food to aid absorption. We also explore ways to improve their study habits alongside the herbal support. Learn more about [Bacopa for memory ](https://www.herbalnootropics.life/bacopa-for-memory)
* **The Outcome:** Students who commit to the long-term use of Bacopa often report feeling more ""on top of"" their studies, less frantic recall during exams, and a general sense of improved cognitive flow. They aren't cramming less, but their brains seem to process and retain information more efficiently.

# The Aging Adult: Maintaining Cognitive Vitality

As we age, natural cognitive decline is a concern for many. Proactive strategies, including smart herbs, can play a supportive role in maintaining brain health.

* **Their Protocol:** For an older client with a healthy lifestyle, I might suggest a combination of **Ginkgo Biloba** for circulatory support and **Cat's Claw** for its potential to increase BDNF and inhibit brain plaques. The emphasis here is on long-term neuroprotection and maintaining cerebral blood flow, crucial for preventing cognitive decline. We carefully review all current medications to avoid interactions, especially with blood thinners.
* **The Outcome:** While not reversing aging, clients often report a sustained sense of mental clarity, better word recall, and feeling more engaged in daily activities. It's about preserving function and supporting the brain's natural resilience.

These examples illustrate that smart herbs aren't magic bullets. They are powerful allies when used intelligently, responsibly, and as part of a comprehensive, doctor-approved health strategy. They work best when you understand their specific roles and integrate them into a lifestyle that already prioritizes brain health.

# FAQs: Answering Your Top Questions About Smart Herbs

I know you've got questions, because everyone does. Let's tackle some of the most common ones I hear in my practice.

**Q1: How quickly can I expect to see results from smart herbs?**

A1: This is probably the most asked question, and honestly, it depends entirely on the herb and your individual physiology. Unlike a cup of coffee, which gives you an immediate jolt, most smart herbs work subtly and cumulatively. For herbs like Bacopa Monnieri, you're looking at **weeks, often 8-12 weeks, for noticeable cognitive benefits** related to memory and learning. Adaptogens like Ashwagandha or Rhodiola might offer initial stress-response benefits within a few days to a couple of weeks, but their full impact on resilience takes longer. It's not an instant fix; it's a long-term investment.

**Q2: Are there any specific smart herbs I should avoid?**

A2: Rather than specific herbs to universally avoid, it's more about **avoiding herbs that interact negatively with your specific health conditions or medications.** For example, Ginkgo Biloba should be avoided if you're on blood thinners unless cleared by your doctor. St. John's Wort, while not primarily a cognitive enhancer, interacts with a vast array of medications, including antidepressants and birth control. This is why **doctor consultation is absolutely critical** before starting any new herb. Also, if you have autoimmune conditions, high or low blood pressure, stomach ulcers, or diabetes, or are pregnant/breastfeeding, always seek medical advice first.

**Q3: Can I take multiple smart herbs at once?**

A3: You can, but the real question is should you? Combining herbs can lead to synergistic effects, where they work better together, but it can also lead to unintended interactions or simply overload your system. As an expert, I usually recommend starting with one herb at a time to assess individual response. Once you understand how your body reacts, you can then consider adding another, always with professional guidance. For example, a combination of Bacopa and Lion's Mane might be synergistic for memory and neuroprotection, but you'd want to introduce them cautiously.

**Q4: What's the deal with ""nootropics""? Are smart herbs the same thing?**

A4: ""Nootropic"" is a broader term, defined as a substance that enhances cognitive function without significant side effects. Smart herbs are a type of nootropic – specifically, those derived from plants. So, all smart herbs are nootropics, but not all nootropics are smart herbs (some are synthetic compounds). When people say ""nootropics,"" they might be referring to the wider category. I find it’s helpful to understand the distinction between natural, plant-based support and laboratory-created compounds. If you're curious about the general definition, check out this resource: [What Are Nootropics](https://herbalnootropics.life/what-are-nootropics)? 

**Q5: How do I know if a smart herb supplement is high quality and safe to buy?**

A5: This is paramount. Since regulation is lax, you need to be a savvy consumer. Look for:

* **Third-Party Testing:** This is non-negotiable. Seals from organizations like **USP (United States Pharmacopeia)**, NSF International, or ConsumerLab verify that the product contains what it claims and is free from contaminants.
* **Standardized Extracts:** This ensures a consistent level of the active compounds in each dose. For example, Bacopa Monnieri supplements should specify the percentage of bacosides.
* **Reputable Brands:** Stick to well-known brands with transparent manufacturing processes and good customer reviews. Be wary of obscure brands making outlandish claims.
* **No Red Flag Ingredients:** Check the ""other ingredients"" list for unnecessary fillers, artificial colors, or sweeteners.

**Q6: Can smart herbs replace lifestyle factors like sleep, diet, and exercise?**

A6: Absolutely not! This is a myth I constantly bust. No smart herb, no matter how potent, can compensate for a poor diet, chronic sleep deprivation, or a sedentary lifestyle. I always tell my clients, **smart herbs are amplifiers, not replacements, for healthy habits.** They work best when they're supporting an already healthy foundation. Prioritize nutrient-dense foods, consistent quality sleep (aim for 7-9 hours!), regular physical activity, and mental stimulation first. Then, and only then, consider smart herbs as a supportive tool to optimize your already healthy brain.

**Q7: What about withdrawal symptoms if I stop taking them?**

A7: Most smart herbs, especially when used responsibly and cycled, do not typically cause severe withdrawal symptoms like some pharmaceuticals. However, your body might have adapted to their supportive effects. If you suddenly stop an herb that was helping with stress or focus, you might notice those original symptoms resurface. This isn’t withdrawal in the addictive sense, but rather your body returning to its baseline without the herbal support. Always best to discuss with your doctor if you're planning to discontinue use, especially if you've been on an herb for an extended period.",1,1759302566.0,cognitivesupport,0,1.0,False

1nv1ibw,https://www.reddit.com/r/runable/comments/1nv1ibw/i_built_an_entire_website_in_5_minutes_using_an/,I built an entire website in 5 minutes using an AI agent – here’s how.,"I know it sounds like clickbait, but it actually happened: I built a fully functional website in just five minutes using an AI agent. As someone who’s created websites the “normal” way (with lots of code and caffeine), I was both skeptical and curious. But thanks to a tool called **Runable**, I watched an entire site come to life while I basically sat back and sipped coffee. Here’s the story of how it all went down, step by step.

# The 5-Minute Website Challenge

It all started when I heard about Runable, an AI agent platform that promises to *“automate any digital task on a computer”* with just natural language. This includes even complex tasks like building presentations or **creating entire websites autonomously**. That claim sounded **crazy** – building a real website typically takes me days of planning, coding, and debugging. Could an AI really do it in minutes?

To find out, I set myself a challenge: **Have Runable build a simple web app from scratch in under 5 minutes.** I decided on a small but complete project – a basic **to-do list web application**. Nothing too fancy: just a front-end where users can add tasks, a way to mark them done, a database to store them, and a clean UI. Normally, even a simple app like this would take me a day or two to code and polish.

With equal parts excitement and doubt, I fired up Runable and gave it a single prompt: *“Build a to-do list website with a front-end, a backend with a database to save tasks, and a nice clean design. Deploy it so I can access it in a browser.”* Then I hit enter and **the clock started**.

# Step-by-Step: How Runable Built My Site

What happened next honestly felt like a scene from a sci-fi movie. Runable **took my request and immediately started breaking it down** into actions, controlling my computer like a super-fast developer. Here’s the play-by-play of those five minutes:

1. **Planning the Project:** Within seconds, the AI agent outlined a plan (I could see it reasoning through steps in the Runable interface). It decided to use a common tech stack for speed: a simple **Node.js/Express** backend with a SQLite database for storing tasks, and a lightweight **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** front-end (using a framework like React was optional, but it opted for plain simplicity given the time). The plan looked something like: *“Initialize project -> set up frontend UI -> set up database -> implement add/delete task logic -> launch server -> deploy.”* I was impressed that it created this roadmap instantly – it was as if an experienced dev had quickly sketched out the tasks in their head.
2. **Setting Up the Environment:** Next, Runable automatically opened a terminal and ran commands to **initialize a new project**. It used `npm` to set up a basic Express server project for the backend, and also created an `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `app.js` for the front-end. I literally watched lines of code and commands fly by on my screen without touching the keyboard. (Fun fact: Runable can control your desktop apps and terminal just like a human would, only much faster)
3. **Building the Front-End (Design & UI):** Within the first minute, the AI had opened a code editor and started writing the HTML for the web page. It created a clean layout: a header, an input box with a “Add Task” button, and an empty list area for the tasks. Then it quickly appended some CSS to make it look presentable – think simple **dark-mode theme** with a modern font and nicely spaced elements. It even included a little bit of JavaScript in `app.js` to handle clicking the “Add” button and updating the task list in the DOM. I noticed it chose a minimalist design (which was fine by me; I’m a function-over-form person). In a funny moment, it initially picked a neon green background for the header (maybe it thought I liked cyberpunk style?), but I asked it to tone that down. With Runable’s support for human feedback mid-task, I could just say *“Make the header background a neutral color”* and it **immediately adjusted** the CSS—changing it to a nice calm blue-gray. Crisis averted 😅.
4. **Setting Up the Backend + Database:** While the page layout was being crafted, Runable was multitasking. It swung over to the backend setup, writing an Express.js server in a file `server.js`. It wrote out routes for adding a task and retrieving tasks. Then it initialized a **SQLite database** (a lightweight file-based DB) using a Node package. I watched it create a database file and define a table for tasks (`id`, `task_text`, `completed` flag). At one point, there was a slight hiccup: the server threw an error because a required SQLite library wasn’t installed. But without me intervening, the agent caught it, ran `npm install` for the missing package, and continued on – all within a span of maybe 10–15 seconds. Seeing an AI **debug its own mistake** that quickly was incredible (if only I could fix bugs that fast!).
5. **Integration – Making Frontend talk to Backend:** Next, the AI added some AJAX calls in the front-end script to communicate with the new backend. It used the Fetch API to call the Express endpoints it created: one to add a new task (sending the text to the server), and one to get all tasks (to refresh the list). This way, when I add a task on the page, it would save to the database via the backend, and then update the list for all users. Essentially, Runable was wiring up the full client-server system automatically.
6. **Testing the Functionality:** Around the 3-minute mark, Runable launched the Express server locally (on, say, `http://localhost:3000`) and opened a browser to test the app. I saw the to-do list webpage load, and the agent actually **simulated typing** into the input and clicking “Add Task”! Sure enough, a new task appeared on the list and persisted (I assume it was indeed in the database, because even after a page refresh it showed up). This was the moment I realized *“Holy cow, it actually works.”* The site was live locally, and doing what it should. I was grinning like an idiot watching an AI be its own QA tester.
7. **Deploying the Website:** With about a minute or two left, I figured the agent might stop at a local demo. But Runable wasn’t done impressing me. It proceeded to **deploy the application** so I could access it from anywhere. Using its autonomous browser skills, it logged into a free hosting service (it chose Render for simplicity, which I already had an account for) and went through the steps I’d do manually: it created a new web service, uploaded the project files, set the start command (`node server.js`), and clicked deploy. I was watching a flurry of automated browser actions – it was honestly hard to follow, it was so fast. In about a minute, the site was live on a public URL! Runable basically handled the DevOps deployment work while I sat there. The **entire process took roughly 5 minutes** from start to finish. I’ve **never deployed a site that fast** in my life, even with all the automation tools I usually use.

When the dust settled, I had a link in my hand to a live to-do list web app that **I hadn’t written a single line of code for**. The AI agent did *everything*.

# The Outcome: A Live Site and a New Perspective

The end result was a functioning website where anyone could add and check off tasks. Was it the fanciest or most scalable app in the world? Of course not. But it looked clean, worked without bugs, and met all the requirements I initially asked for. Frankly, I was **blown away**.

To put it in perspective, this little experiment showed me what’s possible with AI-driven development:

* **Speed:** What would normally be a weekend project for me was accomplished literally on my lunch break. The AI didn’t have to stop to think, Google errors (it seemed to know the fixes), or wrestle with deployment issues – all the usual time sinks for a developer.
* **Autonomy:** I didn’t babysit it. Apart from one or two tiny nudges (like the color change), Runable worked **completely autonomously**. It planned, executed, and iterated on the fly. The platform is designed for this kind of independence – it can perform tasks a human would do on a computer without constant guidance. Watching it juggle a code editor, terminal, and web browser all at once was like seeing a whole dev team compressed into one AI.
* **End-to-End Results:** This wasn’t just code generation or a design suggestion – it was an end-to-end build. Frontend, backend, database, and deployment, all done within one agent. I’ve read about other folks using AI builders to spin up apps and even make money from freelancing (one person landed **15 Upwork projects using a similar no-code AI tool**), but seeing it first-hand was believing.

Of course, I should also mention the **caveats**:

* I picked a relatively simple app. If I had asked for something more complex (say a multi-page app with user auth and payments), I suspect it would take longer or need more guidance. There are limits to what can be done in 5 minutes.
* The code, while solid for a quick build, might not be enterprise-grade. If I were to maintain this project long-term, I’d probably refactor parts of it. AI can create code quickly, but it doesn’t guarantee the *prettiest* code organization a senior dev might craft.
* Security and edge cases were not really addressed. I noticed the agent didn’t add any input validation or security checks (like sanitizing the tasks input). For a toy app that’s fine, but it’s something I’d need to add before calling it production-ready. So, AI agents are amazingly fast, but they don’t automatically make something production-perfect – you still need a human eye for that, at least for now.

# Would You Trust an AI with Your Project?

This experience left me equal parts **excited and uneasy**. On one hand, it felt like I glimpsed the future of software development – a future where we describe what we want and an AI just *builds it*. It opens up possibilities for super rapid prototyping and letting humans focus more on ideas than on brute-force coding. On the other hand, giving that much control to an AI felt a bit like a trust fall. I had to resist the urge to intervene (“are you sure you should do it that way?”) and let it do its thing. And it delivered!

Now I’m turning the question to you: **Would you trust an AI agent to handle one of your projects from start to finish?** If you had a tool like Runable at your disposal, what would you build with it? 🤖⚡️ And for those who have tried super-fast builds (with AI or even just rapid development frameworks), **what’s the quickest you’ve ever gone from idea to a live product?** I’m genuinely curious if anyone can beat my 5-minute website story, or if you have your own “built this insanely fast” tale.

Let me know what you think! Would you take the 5-minute build challenge, or do you prefer a bit more human-in-the-loop for your sanity?

Add your story!,"i wake up, get the eridium from the statue next to my bed, check the tv (weather and luck), check my calendar, and maybe go to the fridge to see if I need anything. I’ve eaten crab cakes and triple shot espresso by now, and I head outside and and get my blessing and my mine perk when I step outside. 

I take a look at my computer, it’s not a harvest
day and my machines are not ready (3 diamond sheds, 2 wine sheds now). Luck isn’t so good today, and I’m not feeling it anyway, so I skip the mine today. 

I head to the beach. I have the dock completely lined with crab pots, and I empty and bait them all. Time to scepter back to my farm.

I head into my house, to the kitchen, and make as many crabcakes as I can and add some things to the fridge. 

It’s been a few days so I go check on my animals. I haven a few of each.. 3 barns full. They all have auto petters and auto grabbers, so I go to each grabber and empty it into my inventory.

I collect all the truffles on the way out, head back into the house and put all the eggs and milk in the fridge, along with the truffles. (I’m not sure why I keep them there, or keep them at all really). The day is half over, so I do any chores that need to be done. (if the silos need hay, for example, or I’m low on triple shot so I go to the desert and trade a stack of diamonds for a stack of it.)

it gets dark and everyone heads into town, so I head over with a ton of… triple shot. I’m too lazy to remember what people like, but all adults like coffee for the most part. and ice cream for everyone. That’s about as much as I care to remember about my friends…. We are slowly learning to like each other. 

I take one last lap around and clean up any debris before finally heading home.

I check the tv for tomorrow’s weather (again) and finally crawl into bed. ",2,1759302401.0,StardewValley,3,1.0,False
1nv1gob,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nv1gob/aita_for_not_going_to_my_best_friends_wedding/,"AITA for not going to my best friend's wedding, even though I wasn not invited?","Hello, redditors, this is my first post so please be gentle! And also apologies because this is quite a long one!

For context, I (25F) met my best friend (we'll call her Anna) (26F) at uni, some 4 years ago. She was one of the first people I met after moving to a different city, and although we did not immediately get close, we eventually became each other's rocks. We were very different, her being gorgeous and outgoing, confident, and very smart, albeit a bit privileged, and me preferring quieter evenings, having a more rational than romantic outlook on life, from a humbler background, and with a humbler taste in things.

After uni, I was looking for a flatmate and she was just moving out of her dorm and we thought it was the perfect thing to move together - and we did, and it was.

I have heard about friends moving in and then becoming sworn enemies over petty house issues, but we never had a single problem. I like my kitchen immaculate, and although Anna is quite messy, all she ever ""cooked"" was coffee, and ordered in/ate out everything else so there was never an issue there as I did not mind a few tiny coffee spills here and there; we would have frequent movie nights and game nights with friends, go out, get ready for things together - sharing clothes and makeup, we had many common friends too and it was basically a dream period as I had had troublesome flatmates before.

Then one day, her bf of 4 years proposed to her.

Now before you wonder why she was living with me and not her bf, that is because she was an international student, and was from a European country (we were in the UK) and her bf (let's call him Sam) was working in their hometown.

Anna had described problems between them to me before, to the point of wanting to break up with him and almost cheating on him a few times, but holding back simply because she was in a relationship - not out of loyalty to him, if that makes sense.  
According to Anna, her friends back home, including Sam, were not emotionally mature enough, or even just generally smart enough (think uber white privilege) - and that was something she loved about our friendship, that she was able to talk about more serious things in life with me too, as much as the sillier things.

Sam had also been telling Anna he wanted to move to the UK to be with her as she was working here, but was being very lazy and unterested with the Visa and job application process. I had asked her multiple times why she was even with Sam if she felt he was holding her back (she believed Sam wasn't planning to move), but she never really gave a clear answer why, and I always thought that it was because he was a ""safe"" option. A backup. He was dedicated to her and she did not want to venture out and not find that dedication elsewhere.

Anyway, a few weeks before the proposal, Anna and I had been talking about her upcoming trip home and how she might break up with Sam when she went. But then she found out through a friend that Sam was planning to propose and had been planning something big, and suddenly she was very excited about getting married. I was confused and told her that while I was very happy that she was happy, I hoped she was making a thought-out, informed decision, and not one because this was safe and ""natural"". She said I was overthinking it and that she couldn't wait to see her ring and her proposal, and plan her wedding. We even went to bridal shops preemptively so she could try on dresses and find her style before going home.

So she left for home. Now this is also where a little trouble began. It became almost impossible for me to talk to Anna. This was initially because as soon as she went, an earthquake hit and people close to her were affected deeply. Anna is a pychologist and joined efforts to rehabilitate people emotionally. I told Anna she should take all the time she needs to process and feel better and that I will continue to check in every now and then and all I needed was a text - even if it was a full stop or an emoji, just to know she was okay and hanging on. And that I was available on call whenever she needed me. We had a couple calls over the span of the next 2-3 months, but I was happy knowing she was safe, and proud knowing she was helping people.

I will admit though, that I was a bit uncomfortable with the cut off in contact. Even weeks after the whole calamity died down, I was happy to initiate all convos, but I hardly ever heard anything from her besides her short responses to my questions. Slowly, I started communicating to her that I was feeling a bit ignored as she would often not reply for days before picking up a conversation like nothing happened, and providing no explanation for being MIA (I knew at this point that rescue/help efforts had subsided and life was resuming to how it was before).

After a couple weeks of not texting her first to see if she would, she called me in happy tears telling me she got engaged. At that time, I forgot I was mad at her and cried with her and congratulated her. It was the proposal of her dreams. Sam took her to a friggin remote, romantic island on a yacht, rented an entire restaurant, had napkins printed with the date and their names, and had secretly invited all their closest friends (he knows Anna likes the attention) for the proposal. I don't know much about jewellery, but the ring was beautiful, and I'm guessing not cheap either.

Y'all I can't make this up, after the proposal, everyone else left the island, but Anna and Sam had a suite booked for them and a cake waiting that said ""She said yes!"" with balloons and champagne.

For Anna, who enjoys flamboyance, it was perfect, and I loved it for her, even from afar.

When it came to wedding planning, she said she would have 2 weddings, a larger one for all relatives, and a smaller, more intimate one for the closest friends and family. I would naturally be invited to both, she said.

The dates? Undecided. Venue undecided. The only thing she knew was that her bridesmaids would wear blue and we picked out my dress.

Then we went LC again. She would just say she was busy, or not take my calls, or take them when she was with people and hang up quickly, all the while assuring me nothing was wrong, she was just busy.

She invited me to her bachelors in her hometown, but the invite was for a weekend, and it was a 3 hour journey to my nearest airport, and a 5 hour flight to her country, with more time then to her home town and it did not make sense for me to travel to her for 10 odd ours, party, and then travel back again for that duration (and I was a bit tight on money then so I could not afford a longer trip anyway) so I told her that I would come for a longer duration closer to her wedding, instead of making multiple trips to her. She agreed, although seemed disappointed.

Another period of LC and then I saw photos of her on instagram. Of her wedding. She looked beautiful of course, and the wedding was beautiful too, but I wasn't there. What was worse, was that some other friends of hers from the UK (not common friends) were at the wedding too. Wearing blue. Both weddings had taken place and all the information I had was through photos AFTER the weddings.

I did not know what to say, or how to even say anything to her. So i texted her congratulating her, and nothing else. Frankly, I don't remember exactly what she replied with, but it was short and along the lines of ""thanks, it was great!"".

I did not attempt to contact her after that. Until one drunken night of course.

I was drinking at home with some friends (we had game night) when I suddenly got very upset with Anna, felt abandoned and cheated, and decided to call her, against the advice of my friends around me. I went to my room to talk to her. Anna was angry at ME for not being at her wedding?!??!

She told me that as one of her closest friends, I should never have needed an invite and should have just showed up?! I asked her if she was serious. I did not have dates, nor her address, how on earth would I just drop unexpectedly to her country, to her wedding without that information?! And then do what there?

Then it was my fault for not asking for those details..... She said I could have shown more interest and communicated better as she was busy with wedding prep and couldn't find the time to send me every single detail. So I asked her to go through our chats and call logs and see who initiated every single call and text. Who asked questions and who only responded. Her being unapologetic kind of broke me and took me to the opposite side of the closure I was seeking. No explanation, no apologies, just blame on me for not being, i don't know, clingier?

I discussed this with a common friend and she was on my side, but as I was speaking this story out loud, I began to wonder maybe if I was at fault too? If I should in fact have asked more uestions, or done more to stay in touch? I guess I'm just looking to vent to a neutral audience and seek validation for this.

I said stretching my back. 

""Yeah, but just think of the paycheck man. No kids, no wife, no life. But you get to keep most of that money."" Mark said slapping me on my back with a slight laugh. To be honest he helped pop my back with that hit.

""Ha ha. I'm single cause I haven't met anyone yet man. As for kids... well to be honest I never wanted any.""

""Trust me when I say I wouldn't trade my son for anything. Day he was born I looked at him and said I'm gonna be there for him. My pop left us when I was a kid. My unc was the only real father figure I had, and he was an asshole."" 

Mark said as he sat down on the bench in the locker room and began untying his boots. Working a paper plant is a lot of work but it's a living. Except working in the pulp run off room. Yeah, nobey should have to smell that every day. Like raw sewage.

""So, you look at that car I sent you on Facebook? Pretty good deal for once. Not one of those I know what I got heaps people ask to much for.""
I laughed ""Yeah. But I don't know man. The train is not so bad. It's cheap and I can get off less the two blocks from my house.""

Mark looked at me as he put on clean pants and stripped the paper dust coverd ones off. ""Dude, I'm telling you. Having your own ride means you are more free to go places. And I'm more free from dropping you off and picking you up from that station.""

I laughed ""Aww but you wont get to spend as much time with me."" 

""Bite me"" Mark said with a smile.

We soon got into his car and drove away from the mill. In a way Mark was right about the freedom that comes with owning a car. But, I also like not having to pay for gas or insurance. Then again I do give him money for gas and spend money on a train ticket. Hmmm, maybe I should look more. But it wont be on Facebook Marketplace. Mark soon dropped me off at the train station. A quick ride of thirty minutes and I will be home. Gotta feed Olivia my dog. 

As I sat there I started doom scrolling on both Tik Tok and Insta. Nothing else to do really. 

(HHHHHHRRRRRRRRNNNNN!!!!!) 

Well, looks like my trains here. I put my phone away and got on. Just like clockwork the conductor comes for tickets. Looks like it's Beth today. Pretty bad when I take the train so much that I know the conductors. 

""Hi Brian.""

""Hi Beth.""

""I got some bad news for you tonight.""

""Oh?""

""Well, they changed our route. We are gonna be passing your normal stop and going another twenty minutes down the line.""

""You're joking?"" I looked at Beth in disbelief. ""Shit! That puts me getting home at like 2 am.""

""I'm sorry Brian. But the stop where we are going does have a train coming that stops at your stop. Here, since you always ride with us and help keep me employed. I got you a ticket for it. On me.""

 Beth handed me the ticket. As I looked it said my return train would arrive at 2:30 am. So it looks like it will be 3 am now. Great. Now I really need a car. I thank Beth and just kinda looked out the window. The train going an extra twenty minutes means I get to sit at a small countryside stop. Oh well, guess I get to see the night sky for once. I soon got off at the small country stop. Beth waved bye to me as the train left the station. Kinda reminded me of one of those old movies in all honesty. 

 The station was small. More like a wooden building with a ticket office. A light surrounded by bugs hummed at the end of the platform. It was quiet. I always luked that about the countryside. But, the lights of the city are what drew me in. I looked up at the star filled sky as I sat down on the bench. I had time to kill and cell service was always spoty this far out.

""Beautiful isn't it?"" 

""JESUS!"" I said as I jumped up from the bench. The strange voice came out of nowhere. I looked and saw an old man at the end of the platform. 

""I've been called many things in my life but never that. Ha ha. Sorry for the scare. I just saw you star gazing and thouvht I'd say hi since we both are waiting.""

""No. Sorry. It did scare me. But.."" The old man just chuckled and said it was fine. 

""Mind if I share the bench? My back tends to hurt if I stand for to long.""

""Of course. Yeah.""

""I'm Henry."" The old man said with an almost gradfatherly tone. A kind and warm smile was across his face.

""I'm Brian."" 

""Pleasure to meet you Brian. What brings you out this way?""

""Oh, they changed my stop. I usually got off back in the city. But they said I would now have to take a connecting train back.""

""Bah! Sounds like over complicating something that doesn't need to be."" Henry said waving off what I said. ""I'm here to catch a train home as well. My wife is expecting me. I suspect she has a nice cup of coffee and some of those cookies I like.""

""Ooo."" I said outloud ""Coffee and cookies does sound nice.""

""Haha perhaps your wife will make you some?""

""Nah. I'm single at the moment.""

""Ah. No shame in that. To rush into a relationship will always end in disaster. There is a lid for every pot young man. Just remember that. You'll find the one you were meant to be with one day. I met my Aida when I was around your age. I'm 87 now. We had a couple children. I worked hard to give them all a good life. (Sigh) But my boy still hasn't found his way. Oh, sorry. Not meaning to talk your ear off.""

I laughed ""No it's all good. It's helping to pass the time while we wait.""

""Rare sight these days not seeing someone with their face in their phone. People who look more at the world tend to notice things others miss."" 

""True. If you don't mind me asking. What did you mean your son hasn't found his way?""

""Oh."" He said with a smile ""He's just lost is all. Made some bad choices as we all do in life. But he lets it get the better of him and he has his angry moments. But, he is my son and I love him.""

(WWWOOOOOOO WWWOOOOO!)

""That sounded odd? Sounds like an old train whistle"" I said looking in the direction the noise came from.

""Indeed. I suspect that's my train. Yours should be coming soon as well.""

It was then that I saw it. An old fashiond steam train. You don't see these anymore really. Maybe they used for tourists? I know some places still use this for that. But running it at 2 in the morning is odd. It was as the train drew closer to the station I could make out more. There was no steam coming from it. It had an almost strange feeling to it. Like I wasn't supposed to see it. As the train slowed I could see nothing but a green ish light coming from the cabin windows of the cars. They mived almsot silently.

I should have been hearing the breaks at least but not even that.

""Young man. Would you mind helping me to my feet? My knees have locked on me.""

I turned to Henry and took him by the arm to help him up. He was cold. Almost ice cold. 

""You should ask for a blanket when you get on. Your freezing Hen....""

I froze mid sentance. As Henry stood I saw it. A small knife sticking in his back. Several stab wounds and a lot of dry blood. I let go of Henry and stared at the knife.

""Brian. Love those in your life and forgive them when you can. And find you a good girl who you will be happy with."" Henry said as he fully stood.

I just starred at him in shock. What the hell was going on? It was then I heard someone yo my left. A man dressed in an old conductor outfit stpped off the train. He was thin with sunken cheeks. His eyez were hollow. Not gone just hollow.

""This train is bound for glory. But it's not your time to ride."" The conductor said in an other worldy deep voice.

I could feel my heart pounding as I watch Henry get onto the train. As he stepped up he turned and waved to me with that kind and warm smile. The conductor stpped onto the car behind Henry and waved at the train. 

(WOOOOO WOOOOO!)

 The old train jerked forward. Henry was seated in a window seat as they left the station. That was the first time I had seen a ghost. That was the first time I saw The Train Home.

Ok I get it YOU DON'T LIKE THE FUCKING GAME but why do you take time out of your life to hate a game you don't like/play/buy or any positive activity towards the game?

I wrote multiple comments about it: 

- multiplayer - decent imo, grinded the camo, enjoyed overall experience, sometimes even just put a music on and go stomp 'this made me preorder bf6' kids.

- warzone - good, loved the sweat in the ranked play. I did not play OG Verdansk but let me tell you the hard truth -> when you leave out the feeling of covid, lockdown, friends, drinking beer and smoking weed it' mediocre map at the best. Urzikstan was good, with the lowered ttk i think it would be even better.

- enjoyed resurgence a lot, also hard truth, Area 99 WAS NOT THAT FUCKING BAD, not sure why all the hate, but whatever.. 

- SBMM is a must, not sure why everyone hates it (i know its just 0.90kd idiots). It keeps game challengin. When I kill a lower skilled player than me I just don't get same high from it... it sucks. I've read somewhere that 80% of warzone players have around 1.0kd not sure if its true but if it is... then boys let me tell you.. its not SBMM, you need to find other game to play... time ran you over.

- cheating - yes there are cheaters I agree, but most of the players did not see a cheater, they just got slammed by a better player. And now all this paranoia is generated that who ever kills you it must be a cheater. I have two friends that suck at the game and they just call everyone cheater and report them... like dafuq?

- BO7 -> will I play it? Yeah.

Buy it? Probably I enjoy arcade feel of it. But not before I play the beta and see 1 or 2 weeks how it runs.

To be honest game looks good, what they announced looks promising. If I understood it there will be 2 big maps 2 small ones in rotation? Multiplayer maps for warm up /chill sessions, good stuff.

How does everyone else feels  about it?

- Bf6 -> not my cup of tea, big scale 'wars' are just like meat grinder. But I will definitely try firestorm. Hopes and prayers its good. Multi + 2 battleroyals, winter looks promising. 

Cheers eveyrone i hope you have a great day, thanks for reading my morning coffee rant! And sorry for typos I cant be bothered to correct it via phone.

You know how my phone used to be permanently tethered to a power bank by 3 PM? I’d be out and about, and it would just give up on life, leaving me map-less and music-less. It was a constant, low-grade stress.



My turning point was finally getting a phone with a better battery, like the iPhone 17. The difference isn’t just about specs; it’s the quiet peace of mind that starts the moment I unplug it in the morning. I’m no longer that person desperately scanning a coffee shop for an outlet.



The funniest part is the psychology of it. I read that we get anxious when our phone drops below 20% because our brain treats it like a primal threat—like we’re running out of water in a desert. With a battery that actually lasts all day, that panic just… vanishes. It’s liberating.



Now, a full day of heavy use—navigation, podcasts, scrolling—doesn’t even phase it. I just plug it in at night with plenty of juice to spare. It’s a small change, but it genuinely makes the whole day feel smoother.

You know how I'm always the first one to huddle near an outlet at the coffee shop, like a plant leaning towards the sun? My phone battery was basically a timer counting down to zero from the moment I unplugged it. I finally reached a point where carrying a power bank felt like an extra limb.



It was that desperation that made me pay closer attention to the battery life on the new iPhone 17. I was skeptical, but I have to say, the shift has been quiet but profound. I recently went from a 7 AM start to a late 9 PM finish, using maps, taking photos, and yes, probably too much social media, and I still had about 20% left. It’s the first time in years I’ve left the house without that low-battery anxiety.



The real game-changer, and this is the coolest part, isn't just the hardware. It’s the smarter software that learned my routine. It does this subtle thing where it actually delays charging past 80% if it knows I wake up at a certain time, just to preserve the battery's long-term health. It’s like it’s thinking for me, making sure the battery doesn’t sit at 100% all night, which is apparently what slowly kills all our phone batteries over time.



It’s a small detail, but it feels like the phone is finally working with me, not against me. I don't have to think about it anymore, and that, honestly, is the real feature. I just get to the end of the day now without that frantic search for a cord. It’s freedom.

You know my eternal struggle every afternoon around 4 PM—that frantic search for an outlet, my phone clinging to a pathetic 5%. It’s our modern-day panic. I was just thinking how our entire social plan used to hinge on ""where"" we were going, but now it’s just ""where can we sit near a wall plug?""



It’s that whole battery anxiety that made me really pay attention to the rumors about the iPhone 17. The big talk is all about its battery life, specifically how it might finally go head-to-head with the latest Samsung Galaxies. My friend with his Galaxy always has this smug look when my screen dims, so the idea of a true showdown is pretty appealing.



The most interesting thing I read, though, wasn't about a bigger battery, but a smarter one. Apparently, a huge drain comes from your phone constantly searching for a signal in weak areas. Rumor has it the iPhone 17 might use some kind of predictive AI to learn your daily movement—like your commute—and pre-emptively manage its signal searching to avoid wasteful power drains. It would be learning to be more efficient, not just carrying a bigger gas tank.



If that’s even half-true, it would be a game-changer. Imagine actually getting through a full, heavy-use day without that low-power warning sending you into a spiral. We could go back to judging outings by the coffee quality, not the outlet accessibility. I might even get to be the smug one for a change.

Day 2: Mt cook - Hike Hooker Valley track and check out lake tekapo if time allows. Drive to Wanaka. (2hrs 15 min) Spend the night in Wanaka

Day 3: Rob roy glacier hike in Aspiring National Park

Day 4: Roys peak hike and leave for te anau (3 hrs drive) Spend the night in te anau

Day 5: Drive to Milford and Milford sound tour. Spend the night in te anau

Day 6: Drive to Queenstown (2 hrs drive) Fly to Nelson 

<Now this is where we are deciding if we should skip Abel Tasman and fly to Auckland directly. If not, here’s how it will look. Please suggest any better options.>

Day 7: Abel Tasman (kayak)

Day 8: Nelson to Auckland airport. Drive to Rotorua (3hrs drive), spend night there 

Day 9: Spend the day at Waimangu Volcanic valley + Waikite Valley Hot pools 

Day 10: Drive to Hobbiton and then to Auckland (spend the night in Auckland)

Day 11: Ferry to Waiheke Island and spend the day

Day 12: Fly out of Auckland in afternoon

I want an opinion on whether this itinerary is feasible or if it looks more packed. What are people’s suggestions to improve this? 

Any spot I should prefer over the ones I have in the plan? Any other unique hiking spots?

Also is Abel Tasman worth it? As you can see from our plan, it's pretty out of our way. Any suggestions on how to incorporate it better?

You know that moment in the afternoon when your phone hits 10% and you feel a genuine pang of anxiety? I was there just last week, desperately hunting for an outlet in a coffee shop like it was a hidden treasure. It’s funny how that little percentage bar can dictate your entire schedule.



I started digging into why batteries degrade and found something that completely changed my perspective. It turns out that constantly charging your phone to 100% is actually more stressful for the battery long-term. I had it backwards all this time; I thought a full charge was the goal. The sweet spot for battery health is actually between 20% and 80%.



That’s when I started reading about the rumored battery tech in the iPhone 17. The buzz is all about a new stacked battery design that not only holds more power but is supposed to degrade much slower. Imagine not having to mentally map every public charging spot by 4 p.m.. It feels less like a simple upgrade and more like a potential liberation from that low-battery anxiety.



Honestly, just learning that charging habit trick has bought me some peace of mind for now. But the idea of a phone that’s built from the ground up to avoid this whole dance? I’m quietly hopeful. It would be nice to have one less thing to worry about.

I've been dealing with a noisy espresso machine lately, and I thought I'd share what I've learned after diving deep into this common problem. Trust me, I know how annoying those unexpected sounds can be when you're trying to make your morning brew.

First off, let's be clear - espresso machines naturally make some noise during operation. But if you're hearing unusual sounds, there might be something that needs attention. After researching and experimenting with my own machine, I've identified several common causes.

The most frequent culprit is limescale buildup. Living in an area with hard water, I've experienced this firsthand. When mineral deposits accumulate inside your machine, they can cause strange grinding or squealing noises. Regular descaling is crucial for maintaining your machine's health.

Another common issue is the pump. If you're hearing a loud grinding or struggling sound, your pump might be having trouble pushing water through. This often happens when the machine hasn't been used for a while or when the coffee is ground too finely.

Speaking of maintenance, I recently upgraded to a newer model from [affiliate link] when my old machine started making unbearable noises. The difference in sound level is remarkable, and the coffee tastes so much better!

Air bubbles in the system can also cause weird noises. If your machine sounds like it's struggling or making gurgling sounds, try running it without coffee to purge any trapped air.

Here's what helped me reduce noise levels:
- Regular cleaning and descaling
- Using filtered water
- Not tamping the coffee too tightly
- Keeping the machine well-maintained

If you've tried these solutions and still hear concerning noises, it might be time for an upgrade. I can personally recommend checking out these reliable machines at [affiliate link]. They're significantly quieter and built to last.

Remember, prevention is better than cure. Regular maintenance and proper use will keep your machine running smoothly and quietly. I clean mine weekly and descale monthly, which has made a huge difference in performance and noise level.

One final tip: keep your machine on a solid, level surface. Sometimes what we think is machine noise is actually vibration against the counter!

I’m in Berlin and Pilates has become such a big passion for me. I’m actually working on the idea of opening a Pilates studio here.

I’d love to meet other women who also love (or are curious about) Pilates — whether it’s going to a class together, grabbing a coffee, going for a walk, or just chatting. 

It would be so nice to connect with like-minded women here.",3,1759299880.0,berlinsocialclub,4,1.0,False
1nv0teo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nv0teo/the_hollowbend_line_part_1/,The Hollowbend Line [Part 1],"Before I get into the story, I should explain why I’ve never talked about it until now. What happened took place years ago, and for reasons I can’t fully explain, I couldn’t tell anyone. It wasn’t just fear, though there was plenty of that. It was more like, if I spoke about it, I might ruin something I wasn’t supposed to touch.

But lately, keeping quiet feels heavier than telling it. I’ve carried it long enough. So this is my account, exactly as I remember it.

“I feel like we should’ve packed warmer clothes. It’s freezing out here,” I muttered, wishing I had a jacket to wrap tight around me.

Just minutes ago, the weather had been sunny and pleasant. Then, without warning, a fog rolled in. Thick, heavy and swallowing the landscape whole. The temperature plummeted so fast it was like we’d stepped into another season. A fine mist clung to everything, beading on our hair, our clothes, the metal rail we perched on. The warmth was gone, replaced by a creeping cold that seemed to seep straight into my bones.

“Do you think a train will come through?” I asked, watching my breath curl into the mist like smoke. The tracks stretched ahead in both directions, vanishing into the pale curtain of fog.

Grace shook her head slowly, unfazed. “Doubt it. These tracks haven’t seen a train in decades. The town they used to connect to was abandoned sometime in the ’90s. My dad said the whole place just sort of… died.”

She fished a cigarette from the crumpled pack in her pocket and lit it with a practised flick. For a second, the lighter’s flame carved her face in sharp relief, highlighting her cheekbones, the slope of her nose, before it vanished again into the gloom. The warmth of the fire blends in with the natural caramel of her skin. The ember glowed faintly at the tip as she drew in a breath, then dulled as she exhaled a soft stream of smoke that mingled with the mist.

I glanced around, trying to find some kind of landmark, something familiar. All I saw was fog. A faint hiss of drizzle met the gravel at our feet, and somewhere in the distance came a hollow echo, too far away to name, too close to ignore.

We sat in silence, the quiet stretching until it felt heavier than the fog itself.

“So, why bring me out here?” I finally asked, my voice low.

“I told you.” She exhaled another ribbon of smoke, her words drifting along with it. “My parents grew up there. They left just before things went bad. I just wanted to see my parents’ hometown.”

I frowned. “Yeah, but why bring me?”

“Because all my other friends are interstate. You’re the closest.” She said it flatly, firmly, like there was nothing more to explain.

I opened my mouth to argue, then shut it again.

“We should’ve driven,” I muttered instead. “Do we even have service out here?”

“Dude, can you shut up and just be a good friend?” Grace shot me a look, equal parts exasperation and amusement. She wasn’t wrong. This trip mattered to her, and I was turning it into a checklist of complaints. So, I shut my mouth and nodded.

She finished her cigarette down to the filter, crushed it against the gravel with the toe of her Converse, and stood abruptly. “C’mon. We should get there soon so we’re not walking back in the dark.”

“This is why we should’ve driven,” I grumbled, pushing myself off the rail.

“Don’t be stupid. The roads are blocked off. Do you think your poor Barina, or my poor Laser, could possibly survive off-road?” She raised her eyebrows, daring me to answer.

I pictured our sad little cars bogged down in mud, bumpers scraping over rocks, wheels spinning uselessly. The image made me grin despite myself. She was right. I was being stupid.

“Fine,” I said, adjusting my bag. “Lead the way.”

And with that, we set off down the tracks, into the fog, heading toward the town I already wished we’d never decided to find.

 

We kept walking for another twenty minutes, half of it in silence, half of it filled with the kind of useless bullshit we found entertaining.

Grace and I had been friends for a few years. I still remember the first time I met her. We initially met in a film class at university during one of those mandatory group projects they assign. I remember Grace sitting across from me, her hair neatly pulled back, her dark fingers thoughtfully tapping her notebook. She considered every one of my thoughts with an intense focus that made me lose my train of thought. I've never been good at making friends and was at a total loss for words, but Grace always had a confident answer ready; she seemed to know what to say.

That first day, I asked her what her favourite movie was. It was supposed to be an icebreaker, but she didn’t answer right away. She tilted her head, like the question was more complicated than I’d meant it to be.

“I don’t know, dude, that’s a hard question. Like, how could I even begin? All art is a conversation, and to say a film is better than another is to ignore that conversation entirely. Like how Michael Haneke’s *Funny Games* is a clear response to the 80s slasher craze, or how *Vertigo* twists the whole detective-thriller formula back on itself, y’know?”

I just stared at her for a second, dumbfounded. She’d always been smarter than me, or at least knew how to sound like it.

She shrugged, as if aware she’d lost me. “But if I had to pick? Alejandro Jodorowsky’s *The Holy Mountain.*” A small smile tugged at her lips, half-proud, half-daring me to call her pretentious. “How about you?”

I cleared my throat, suddenly aware of how average I sounded next to her. “Uh… probably *Spider-Man 2.*”

Her grin broke wide, “*Spider-Man 2?”* she said in a cheeky tone, and just like that, we’d talked for hours.

Back in the fog, I found myself glancing sideways at her, that same grin flickering in my memory. Grace always had a way of making things bigger than they seemed. She

“What do you think, uh, what’s the town called?” I stumbled

“Hollowbend, I told you like five times.” She said, half annoyed,

“Right, Hollowbend. Anyway, what do you think the state we’ll find it in will be?”

“I don’t know. Probably overgrown, smashed windows, graffiti. The same state you find in all abandoned places.”

A shadow moved in the fog ahead, tall and thin, or maybe it was just a tree twisted against the mist. My stomach tightened. “That… that looks like a building.”

Grace squinted. “Finally. You’re catching on. That’s probably the old general store. I don’t think Hollowbend had much else besides that and the church.”

As we drew closer, the outlines became clearer: a single-story wooden building, paint peeling in strips, windows caked with grime. One of the panes had a jagged hole, and through it, darkness stared back at us. A sudden scuttle of something small, rats, maybe, made me jump. On the notice board out front was a map of the town dated from the late 60s. Some residential areas down the road, the church, the store and a few extra buildings. It was about as big as she said.

“See?” Grace said softly, almost to herself. “Everything’s exactly as it should be. Like frozen in time.”

“Some Silent Hill type shit,” I muttered.

We lingered at the threshold, hesitant. The door hung crooked on its hinges. I could see the faint outline of shelves inside, dusty and bare, a spider web stretched across a forgotten corner. My heart beat a little faster.

“Ladies first,”

“Pussy.”

“Hey man, I just think this is a bit creepy,” I said defensively.

Rolling her eyes, she pushed on the door. It creaked and came half off its hinges, groaning like it hadn’t been touched in decades. Grace stepped inside, and I followed reluctantly.

The air smelled sour. Rot and mildew. Dust clung to every surface. Shelves stood half-collapsed, their contents scattered across the floor. Behind the counter, cash drawers hung open, coins dulled with grime. What was left of fruit and vegetables lay in blackened heaps, alive with maggots and ants.

“Great first impression,” I muttered.

Grace smirked. “Maybe there’s more in the manager’s office.”

We edged toward the back. Each step stirred the silence, our shoes crunching on broken glass and warped floorboards. Grace pushed on the door.

“Help, it’s stuck.”

Together, we rammed into the door with our shoulders, which tore the door off the wall.

 

“What the fuck?”

 

The manager’s office wasn’t an office at all. The room was bare. no desk, no shelves, not even dust. Just a single structure in the centre: three walls, a low roof, and a stairwell that descended into darkness.

The office was as large as the entire shopfront we’d just walked through. From the outside, the building wasn’t nearly big enough to hold both spaces. It was like the store had doubled on the inside.

Grace stepped forward, her voice hushed, almost reverent. “This… this isn’t possible.”

I swallowed hard, staring at the stairwell. Grace took a step forward.

 

“We shouldn’t-” I started, but she cut me off with a single look.

“Marc.”

“Fuck me.”

We made our descent.

 

The deeper we went, the more the dark closed around us. Our phone torches cut thin beams into the black, but it was like shining light into ink; the glow barely reached the next step ahead. Every breath felt swallowed, every sound dulled. It wasn’t just dark. It was a kind of dark that ate the light whole. Ten steps. Fifteen. The rectangle of light above us vanished, swallowed whole. I looked back, but the doorway was gone. Just black.

“Grace…” My voice cracked. “I don’t think this staircase ends.”

“Don’t be dramatic,” she shot back, but I heard the strain in her voice.

The stairs kept going, a twisting descent into a silence that felt heavier than the damp air. My phone, held in a trembling hand, showed no change in temperature, but my breath still fogged in the oppressive gloom. Each step on the slick stone was a small, echoing sound that was immediately swallowed by the profound darkness. Twenty steps became thirty, then fifty, and I felt a dizzying sense that we weren't just going down, but folding inward, pulled by some unseen force deeper than should be possible.

Grace's silence was more unnerving than any complaint I could have made. She kept her torch fixed on the steps ahead, her face a mask of fierce concentration. This was her mission, and a part of me felt like she was a sleepwalker on a path only she could see. When the stairs finally ended, they didn’t lead to another hallway or room, but to a massive, metal door. It was rusted and pitted, with a heavy, circular handle. We shared a look, a silent agreement that there was no turning back now.

""Ready?"" I whispered, my voice a dry rasp.

She didn't answer, just grabbed the handle and braced herself. I put my shoulder against the cold metal, and together we pulled. The door groaned, a terrible, scraping shriek of protest that seemed to tear through the solid rock around us. As it slowly opened, a light escaped, casting a pale glow on the stairwell.

We squeezed through the narrow opening. Instead of a dusty cellar or another derelict room, we stood in a clean, albeit unorganised, office. Sitting at a desk, looking over some paperwork, caught up in thought, was a balding man, maybe in his 40s.

""Hello?"" I let out after a few seconds.

The man jumped slightly, clearly startled. He looked up, his eyes wide behind his glasses. He seemed to take in our muddy shoes and wind-whipped hair before his gaze landed on the gaping hole where the door had been.

""Who the hell are you guys?"" he asked, his voice a tight coil of anger and confusion. ""What are you doing here? Customers aren't supposed to be back here.""

We just stared at him, unable to form a coherent response. The sheer normalcy of the man was more unsettling than some faceless figure I’d conjured in my mind. He wore a simple button-up shirt and khakis, and the desk was littered with pens and half-empty coffee mugs. The only thing out of place was… us.

""We… uh… we just followed the stairs,"" Grace finally managed to stammer, her voice a reedy whisper.

The man looked with a mix of frustration and confusion and ran a hand through the small amount of his hair. ""The stairs? Right, look, whatever you're doing, you need to leave.”

I turned to look behind us. My heart lurched. Where the heavy steel door had stood was now just a broom closet.

“Where are we?” I blurted.

The man looked at me like I was simple. “You’re in my office. Hollowbend General Store. And you’re not supposed to be here.” He tapped his papers. “Now, please. My schedule’s full until ’93.”

My stomach dropped. I turned to Grace, who looked pale, her face a mixture of disbelief and horror.

She cleared her throat. “Sir… what year is it?”

He stared at her, a look of complete bewilderment on his face. ""It's 1992. October. Are you two alright? You seem a little out of sorts. Is the heat getting to you?""

A cold, internal dread settled in the pit of my stomach. ""No, we're fine, just a bit unsettled. We'll leave you in peace,"" I said, gently pushing Grace toward the door.

""Wait.""

We stopped and turned back to face him. He opened a desk drawer, pulled out two plastic water bottles, and tossed them to us. ""Stay hydrated, guys.""

""Thanks,"" we said in unison.

We walked through the general store, now transformed into a nice, cleaned-up grocery instead of the forgotten shell we saw previously. Leaving through the front, revealing a vibrant street scene. The view was pristine and alive with people. A postman in a neat uniform walking down the street, kids on bicycles, and a few old Holden cars parked along the curb. The harsh sunlight, warm and bright, was a stark contrast to the unnatural grey mist that had just swallowed us. A man sweeping his driveway gave us a wave.

“Morning, folks! Lovely day for a visit, isn’t it?” His voice carried the warmth of a sitcom dad, and yet the way his eyes locked on us made my chest tighten.

Grace nodded politely. “Yeah. Lovely day.”

We walked on. At the corner stood the general store, bright and clean, nothing like the ruin we’d first stepped into. Its big window gleamed, and a neat poster announced *Fresh Bread Every Morning!* Behind the glass, I could see the same man from the office, head bent over his papers again, exactly as we’d left him.

Across the street, a woman in an apron leaned from a bakery window. “You must be new in town!” she called, her voice as cheerful as a song. Her flour-dusted hands waved as if she’d been expecting us.

Grace offered a thin smile. “Just visiting.”

“Oh, visitors!” The woman clapped her hands. “How exciting! You’ll love Hollowbend. We always take care of our own here.” She said it so warmly that it almost felt like a promise.

At the corner stood a diner, its neon sign buzzing faintly: **The Hollowbelly.** Through the window, we saw people laughing, eating, and talking, yet not a single sound leaked out. The silence felt unnatural. But when the door opened, the noise hit all at once, as if the laughter and chatter had been bottled up and unleashed.

“Coffee?” a waitress asked the moment we sat at the counter. Her voice carried a broad rural country lilt; the vowels stretched just a bit too wide. She was tall, her beehive hairdo flawless, her uniform spotless. Her nametag read **BETTY**, though the letters were worn almost to nothing.

“Uh… sure,” I said.

She poured without looking at the cup, and not a drop spilled.

Grace tilted her head at the counter around us. “Huh. It’s like one of those 50s diners from old movies.”

“I’ll tell you what, though,” I said, gulping down the drink. “This is a damn good cup of coffee.”

Grace didn’t answer. Her cup sat untouched, steam curling up, until the curl slowed, then froze in mid-air, hanging motionless like a painted line.

“Marc,” she whispered, her grip tightening on my hand. “I think we shouldn’t have come here.”

“I hate to be a smart ass, but it was you who kept pushing for us to keep going,” I said, sipping again.

“Yeah, but I didn’t think we’d get stuck here.”

Grace’s eyes locked on her cup, lips pressed to a thin line. Behind the counter, Betty polished a glass with a rag that never seemed to get damp, her movements slow, circular, hypnotic.

“You don’t like it?” Betty asked suddenly, her eyes flicking to Grace’s untouched drink.

Grace flinched. “Oh, no, it’s fine. I’m just… not thirsty.”

“If you don’t mind, then,” I slid her cup over to me.

Betty let out a soft laugh. “My, I don’t think I’ve seen anyone like the coffee nearly as much as you.” She kept smiling, as if waiting for me to agree with her.

I chuckled awkwardly. “Guess I’m just a coffee guy.”

“That’s good,” Betty said, nodding too quickly. “Good to know.” She jotted something down on her order pad, though we hadn’t asked for anything else.

A man in overalls shuffled past our stools and took a seat two spots down. He turned toward us immediately, grinning as if we were old friends.

“You two married?” he asked.

Grace blinked. “Uh… no.”

“Shame,” he said, still smiling. “You look married.” He reached for the sugar jar, though he didn’t have a coffee.

Betty leaned across the counter, cheerful as ever. “They just got here, Frank. Don’t scare them off.”

“Not scaring,” Frank said earnestly. “Just asking. That’s how you get to know people. You ask.”

Betty nodded. “He’s right. You do have to ask.”

Grace pressed her lips together and stared at the counter.

“Uh, how long have you uh, lived in this town for?” I managed to stumble out.

“Well, my home life, frankly. Yep, grew up here. It was even smaller back in the day, but now, because of all that industrialisation, people moving to the cities and all, we’ve added buildings slowly and slowly, and now we’re a proper functioning town. But I decided staying was the best for me because I love Hollowbend and I just never found a great reason to leave and, well, I suppose if you never find a reason to go then you just… don’t.”

I’m not sure if I even saw Betty breathe once throughout that whole verbal dump.

Grace forced a polite smile. “That’s… nice.”

Betty leaned closer, lowering her voice as though she were sharing a secret. “And the thing is, everyone who comes here ends up staying. People say it’s the pies, but I think it’s the way the streets feel under your shoes. You know? Comfortable.” She nodded to herself, satisfied.

Frank clapped his hands together suddenly, startling both of us. “Well, now that’s settled. What are your thoughts on root vegetables?”

My mouth opened and closed a few times. Grace blinked.

“They’re… fine?” I offered.

Frank beamed. “Good man. A town can’t run without a good beet crop. Everyone says so.”

Betty chimed in, smiling wide. “Yes, everyone says so.”

Grace and I looked at each other for a few seconds, utter bewilderment and confusion upon our faces.

“Well, I guess we’d best be on our way. Is there uh, a place to stay? Like a motel or something.”

Before realising the mistake I had just made, Betty was already spouting off about the town history and how there used not to be a hotel, but now there is, and who owns it. In that verbal diarrhea, we did manage to hear the name.

“…Friendly Pines Motel,” I repeated slowly, as if saying it aloud would help it make sense.

“Yes! That’s the one,” Betty said, nodding like she’d just handed us the map to paradise. “Very nice. Can’t miss it. Just down Main Street, past the church, turn left at the bank, you’ll see the sign, bright green, says ‘Friendly Pines’ in big, cheerful letters. Don’t worry, dear, you’ll be fine.”

“Great, thanks, Betty.” Grace said, trying to push me out the door.

“Grace, we didn’t pay,” I reminded her, tugging gently on her sleeve.

Betty waved a hand dismissively, a wide, confident smile on her face. “Oh, don’t you worry about that, dear. Coffees on the house. Happens all the time for visitors; some of them never even bring coins. Not that you’d notice.” She gave a little laugh, but it was the kind of laugh that made it feel like she genuinely didn’t see the need for any explanation.

Quickly leaving before we could be roped back into another conversation, we started to walk down the road towards the motel.

“How are we even going to pay for this?” Grace wondered, “I mean, it’s not like we carry cash, and I doubt our credit cards would even work.”

“I was just thinking the same thing. I guess we could always try with our cards and hope for the best.” I offered up.

We walked in silence for a few steps; the town’s neat little streets were lined with brick and timber buildings that seemed almost self-conscious about the space they occupied. Each storefront was meticulously kept, with paint that shone just enough to suggest pride without drawing too much attention. The lampposts were perfectly spaced, the sidewalks swept clean, and yet the precision made everything feel a little unnatural.

Grace’s gaze drifted to the waterfront on our right, the sunlight glinting off the water in a way that made the small bay look almost like a hidden gem, tucked just out of sight. “I didn’t even know this was here,” she murmured, her voice quiet, almost hesitant. “My parents never mentioned it.”

I squinted against the glare, the waves catching the light in fleeting patterns. “Yeah… It’s like the town hides itself until it wants to be seen,” I said, feeling a shiver contrasting with the afternoon sun.

She frowned, tilting her head, as if trying to make sense of the shapes and lines of the streets. “Almost as if it’s trying to condense itself as much as possible, but parts keep spilling out”.

We walked in silence the rest of the way to the motel, passing countless people that seemed too many for the size of the town. The sidewalks were crowded with small conversations: a man leaning too close to a woman as he told a story with exaggerated hand movements; a pair of teenagers laughing a fraction too loud at something unfunny; an old lady sweeping her porch in slow, deliberate strokes, nodding at every passerby as if acknowledging them for an invisible roll call.

The Friendly Pines Motel loomed ahead, its sign in cheery green letters glowing faintly even in the daylight. The exterior was modest, almost shy, but when we stepped through the glass doors, the lobby stretched out before us like it belonged to a completely different building.

Two curved grand staircases swept out from either side of the front desk, their red-carpeted steps climbing upward in perfect symmetry before vanishing around opposite corners. Polished wooden banisters gleamed under the warm light of chandeliers, which swung just slightly, though there was no breeze.

The air smelled faintly of pine and lemon polish. A grandfather clock ticked steadily in the corner, its pendulum swinging a half-beat slower than seemed natural.

Grace stopped short. “This is… not what I expected.”

“WELCOME!” a booming voice rang out from the top of the grand staircase, startling both of us.

We looked up to see a man standing there, striking a pose as though the entire lobby were his stage. He was dressed head to toe in elaborate attire: a deep burgundy tailcoat with gold trim, a towering black top hat perched at a jaunty angle, and a long black cane tipped with a silver wolf’s head. His handlebar moustache was so extravagantly curled it seemed to defy gravity.

Beside him stood a woman, equally theatrical in style, her sequined dress glittering under the chandelier light as if she’d stepped straight out of a 1920s burlesque reel. A feathered headpiece curved upward from her hair, but her face was locked into a scowl of annoyance and hate targeted towards us.

We watched in stunned silence as the man hooked his cane on the railing and, with surprising grace, slid down the banister in a single sweeping motion. The woman followed at his side, descending the staircase with a slinky, deliberate sway.

They landed before us with a flourish.

“Ah, newcomers!” the man announced, sweeping his hat from his head and bowing low, his moustache twitching with the motion. “Welcome, welcome to our fine establishment! I am…” He paused dramatically; cane raised to the ceiling as though summoning lightning. “…Mr. Alastair DuPont, owner and humble servant to all who seek rest beneath the Friendly Pines!”

He struck a pose. For a moment, the air seemed to thrum, and we thought we heard what sounded like a smattering of applause and cheers, but from nowhere in particular.

“And this young thing,” he continued, swooping an arm toward his companion, “is my beautiful wife, Everlyn.”

He bent down with exaggerated gallantry, kissing her hand before springing back upright with theatrical speed. Everlyn, maintaining her poise, slowly reached into her clutch and produced a baby wipe. She wiped hard at the exact spot where his lips had touched, expression unchanged, then discarded the wipe neatly into a handbag without breaking eye contact with us.

“Pleasure.” She said with a tone that just oozed venom and contempt, though Mr DuPont didn’t seem to mind. Grace and I exchanged glances. The whole performance felt rehearsed, like we'd walked into the middle of a play that had been running for decades.  ""We, uh, we'd like a room,"" I managed, my voice cracking slightly.  ""Of course, of course!"" Mr DuPont exclaimed, spinning his cane like a baton before catching it with a flourish. “We shall prepare for you our finest room. Come,” and he immediately started speed walking in the opposite direction, back up the stairs. We tried to follow behind him, but we struggled to keep up with him through all the twists and turns of the motel. Mr DuPont moved with impossible speed, his coat tails billowing behind him as he navigated the maze-like interior with the confidence of someone who'd walked these paths for decades. “Keep up, keep up!"" he called over his shoulder, his voice echoing off the walls.

Finally, Mr DuPont stopped in front of a door marked with a brass plaque that simply read ""The Suite."" He produced an elaborate skeleton key from his waistcoat and turned it with a ceremonial flourish. “Your palace awaits!"" he announced, throwing the door open with a dramatic sweep of his arm.

 “Palace” was a massive overstatement. The room had a double bed that had a noticeable sag in the middle, along with a single nightstand that looked straight out of the 50s. There was a small armchair wedged awkwardly in the narrow gap between the bed and the wall. The wallpaper was a faded floral pattern, peeling at the corners where moisture had crept in over the years. A thin brown carpet covered the floor, worn through to the backing in a path from the door to the bed. Heavy curtains covered the single window.

“This is….” I started to say before being interrupted by, “I know, it’s a lot to take in.” Mr DuPont said, beaming with pride. “The best part is, it’s only $100 a night!” Grace gave me a quick look before asking, “Is there a possibility we could get two single beds in here?”

DuPont looked at us very blankly and said, “No,” before quickly getting back in character. “Well, I’ll leave you to two settle in, I’ll just take your card, and I’ll charge you after your stay comes to an end.”

That worked out conveniently for us.

 

Grace sat heavily on the sagging bed, which creaked ominously under her weight. She pulled her hair free from its tie, letting it fall around her face as she rubbed her temples ""Marc, this is so fucked.""

""I know."" I slumped into the armchair, which was even more uncomfortable than it looked. The springs had given up years ago. ""How do we get back?""

Grace was quiet for a long time, staring out the window at the timeless street scene below. ""What if we can't get back? What if this is just... our life now?""

“I doubt it’s that dire, Grace. I’m sure everything will be fine.” I was bluffing. I just wanted to say something that would make us both feel better.

""Since we're in ‘92, wanna try finding your parents?"" I suggested, mostly to fill the silence.

Grace shifted uncomfortably. ""I don't know. They always got weird when I brought up Hollowbend. Never wanted to talk about it."" She paused. ""But I guess it would be interesting to see what they were like back then.""

She yawned and looked at the single bed. ""So... how are we handling sleeping arrangements?""

I glanced at the uncomfortable armchair. ""I'll take the chair. I've slept in worse places.""

""Don't be ridiculous. We're both adults. We can share a bed without making it weird.""

""If you're sure...""

""I'm sure. Besides,"" she said, settling onto one side of the bed, ""if we're stuck in 1992 forever, we might as well get comfortable.""

I took the other side, both of us staying fully clothed and keeping to our respective edges of the sagging mattress.",2,1759299875.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Meanwhile, they use a super short timer for each ride offer so that they can cheat drivers of hourly pay over time without them knowing it.  Then they hide all the information of a ride as soon as it is accepted so that drivers cannot look over the details and later cancel if they find something off-key because of the unacceptably short timer each ride has to offer.

They use their monopolization of the industry to exercise dictatorial control over drivers who must rent vehicles, knowing that they are at the mercy of Uber.  Uber figures, if they won't take the degenerate rates they offer these drivers, they'll simply manipulate them to be forced to take rides or end up being financially crippled by the $50 a day costs of the rental car industry.

My wife's pregnancy was difficult towards the end she has pre eclampsia, Pregnancy Diabetes and high blood pressure when my wife went into labor she was 2 weeks early the birth ended up taking 3 days our Daughter Kaylee was finally born but due to her early birth and all the Drugs they gave my wife to induce labor and that Kaylee had Jaundice our Daughter had to spend 3 weeks in the special care unit, I held our Daughters tiny hand as they put a tube in her nose to feed her. My wife was able to stay with her the entire time as in the Special unit they had rooms for the mothers i still went to work during this time I'd wake up at 5am to be at the special care unit to be at the special care unit and after 7 days to help Kaylee's 6am feeding go to work at 8am then spend my lunch hour at the hospital at 12pm then back at work at 1300hrs finish work at 1700hrs back home to wash wife's clothes cook her some dinner then up to the special care unit by 1830hrs home by 2200hrs to start it all again, my wife started showing the signs of post-natal depression so after two weeks I brought my family home I took two weeks off work and we started to get used to our new life as a family with my wife's post-natal depression I decided to do all of Kaylees feedings during the night as my wife was expressing milk so this was possible after the two weeks was up I had to go back to work so I kept sneaking home to do housework and sort my wife's lunch to try and help her through this tough time, after a few months she started to get better. 

when Kaylee was around 2 years old my wife's mother had a heart attack and almost died and my wife fell back into a deep depression this seemed to be worse than previous and nothing I did seemed to make a difference so I asked my wife if she wanted to move closer to her family just in case to which she jumped at the idea and said yes (this turned out to be the worst decision of my life) anyway I gave my notice in at work and we made arrangements to move the 500 miles from my family to hers. 

I found a house brought it and we moved in not far from her parents' house, but not once did they come to our home to visit or for coffee nothing that should have been the first red flag anyway it didn't take long to see why my wife had moved so far from her family ! her entire family Mother, Father & Brother treated my wife like a doormat and very badly always taunting and picking on her calling her Fat or insulting her looks or ideas and generally being very mean towards her. Now as my wife's husband if you insult my wife, you are insulting me in my opinion so I would start defending her to her family which would always end up with everyone fighting me Including my wife. After about 6 months of this I turned to my wife on the drive home and told her that I would no longer be going to her parents' house. After about a week my wife started to get very depressed again as she didn't have me defending her any longer this time, I didn't know what to do to help her, so I suggested that's on a Friday or Saturday that she go out with her old friends to reconnect to friends (my second biggest mistake) 

these nights would usually start out with her meeting her friends at her parents' house have a few drinks then head into town. I wasn't aware that my wife's mother Lynnly was inviting my wife's old boyfriends around at the same time during this time sex between me and my wife started to get even less infrequent prior to our wedding it was 2-3 times a day after the wedding it was once every couple of days to once a week after the birth of our daughter. The wife would usually come home drunk and be wasted for the weekend which suited me fine as i would just start going out with our daughter to the parks or train rides or bush walks 

the day my wife left me that morning she fucked my brains out before work then broke up with me in the afternoon to say this hit me as a surprise was a massive understatement (I still was unaware of my wife's infidelity) the first few days I pleaded and begged for us to try and fix things but no matter what I said it only made her more adamant to leave I curled up in a corner of our house with the blinds close I just wanted to die I was hurt confused and in a state of constant disbelief, I couldn't eat anything every time i tried I was physically sick after a couple of weeks my wife brought a bus ticket back to my family where we originally came from 

I stayed at friends we had set up the best man at my wedding Anthony a guy I had served in that army with and Emma my wife's friend and bridesmaid I was living in their garage after a week I decided I just needed to get away from everyone and everything to I grabbed my hunting gear my friend Tony drove me out to the bush and he told me he was concerned for my well-being I told him that he had nothing to worry about, but he said that he was coming out every few days to check on me he headed off and I headed in as it was around 1700hrs I only had about two hours of daylight so I headed in and made camp. the next day I woke up it was brilliant sunny day I found a clearing nearby and sat on a rock I started crying uncontrollably I grabbed my Rifle loaded a round in the chamber put the muzzle in my mouth and pulled the trigger ....the round didn't fire I immediately thought of my daughter and how selfish what I had just tried to do was I lost it completely I cried and sobbed until I couldn't cry any longer and made a decision then and there that I would never do something so selfish and stupid ever again, I also decided that I had to move forward with my life to do this i would move overseas to a different country where my family were situated get a good job in the mines and rebuild my life again. (Oh and before I forget I'm still not sure why the bullet didn't fire that day I was using old ww2 era 303 Tracer ammo had shot thousands of the same type of ammo and never had one misfire I inspected the rounds primer and it had a good strike on it from the firing pin and the gunpowder stripes were dry so the only conclusion I came to was a faulty primer)

I stayed out hunting for another 4 weeks every day I was out I was getting stronger and stronger and Tony was coming out every few days (I never told him about my suicide attempt)

two weeks later I had sold everything and brought my tickets left the country and went home to my mother 5 sisters and Brother 2 weeks after that I had a job in an open cut mine as a shotfirer with an annual salary of over $200,000 a year  

I was on a Fly in fly out FIFO roster of two weeks on one week off and in this time, I kept in contact with my wife and daughter, and I was truly hoping at reconciliation every time I had off, I sent my Wife $2,000 cash and clothes and stuff for Kaylee. I also kept in contact with Tony & Emma and on a call with Tony 6 months later he asked me if I was sending my wife any money I told him that I was and it was $2,000 a month there was silence on the phone I knew there was something very wrong, so I asked him to just come out and say it he then told me how my wife had admitted to Emma that she had been cheating on me 6 months before her leaving me I lost it i hung up and immediately called my wife who I confronted about the accusation and it took over 60 minutes of lies and deflection and accusations for her to admit the truth when she knew that I knew about her cheating and that it was truly over between us she changed completely she did the only thing left for her to hurt me with our daughter she cut all contact between us 

As I had money, I contracted lawyers to start family court proceedings to reestablish contact between me and my daughter it took 10 months and over $40,000 in Lawyers' fees I won the case and was given my rights back as a father I started video calling Kaylee every Tuesday and Thursday this lasted for about a year and a half until my wife discovered that i was no longer working in the mines on the good money so she then cut all contact again for the second time breaking the family court ruling but with nothing to fight it with this time 

How can someone you loved so completely turn into something so Evil I can't comprehend it ? I could never have done what she did to me and Kaylee. My wife has stolen something that I will never ever get back. The last time i saw my daughter she was 5 she is now 15 i think about her all the time i am in constant sadness
