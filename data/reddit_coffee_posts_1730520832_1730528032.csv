I've always been underweight but I want to lose more and I don't know what to do. can someone help explain what I should do? and what you think I have? if anything that is. i know for a fact if i was living alone i would eat much less, and i find myself comparing my body to bloody children at times. i have to eat a lot less than my mum now, and i think its my way of staying in check, but even shes noticed how i cant eat if i havent seen what she has or hasnt had. even drinking water, though i know it has no calories, makes me feel disgusted at times. i just don't know what to do

Welcome, fellow traders and investors! Whether you're stepping into the exhilarating world of trading for the first time or you're a seasoned pro seeking to refine your skills, today you're about to discover a game-changing hack that could revolutionize your trading strategy. This isn't just another tip; it's a paradigm shift designed to bring clarity, elevate your decision-making, and ultimately, boost your trading success. Read on for insights that will equip you with that edge you've been longing for.

THE POWER OF HABIT STACKING: UNLEASHING COMPOUNDED SUCCESS
The secret we're unveiling today is not a complex algorithm or a secret indicator; it's a fundamental shift in your daily routine known as habit stacking. Popularized by productivity experts, habit stacking involves linking new behaviors to existing routines, making them stronger and more automatic.

WHY HABIT STACKING FOR TRADING?
 * Boosts Discipline: Trading is as much about psychology as it is about strategy. Establishing positive habits can help you remain disciplined, even when the market tempts you with rash decisions.
 * Increases Efficiency: Cut through the noise and streamline your approach by systematically linking your trading checklists to existing habits. Got a morning coffee routine? Pair it with your trading journal review.
 * Enhances Decision Making: By fortifying your daily routine with structured, productive habits, you free up mental space to focus on high-impact decisions.

STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO IMPLEMENT HABIT STACKING INTO YOUR TRADING ROUTINE
 1. Identify Key Trading Behaviors: What repetitive tasks drive your trading decisions‚Äîmarket reviews, chart analyses, journaling? List them out.
    
    
 2. Pinpoint an Existing Habit: Find a daily ritual with strong roots‚Äîlike your morning coffee, your pre-market stretching, or post-market meditation.
    
    
 3. Stack the New Habit: Attach your new trading behavior to this routine. For instance, ""After I make coffee, I will review yesterday‚Äôs trades.""
    
    

 4. Start Small and Scale Up: Begin with tiny habits to reduce friction. Over time, these build into robust, automatic actions.
    
    
 5. Track and Adjust: Use apps or journals to track your progress and make incremental adjustments for better alignment with your goals.

What's more is when I first came here I was rich in spirit; which is something poor people say to feel better about themselves. LOL! Seriously, though I was just starting my business and I was only able to take home about $400 a month. 

When I first came here most of the women I met wanted money or to be able to brag to their friends that they screwed a black guy. I didn't really mind either since I didn't have any money to give and what man doesn't like having a lot of girls wanting to get in his pants? But then it got boring and I started to feel used, they'd take me to bed but never home to mom. 

So then I tried to date girls seriously and it was a little tougher. Once they realized I was telling the truth when I said I didn't have any money suddenly they became busy. Then I realized it was time to change strategies. I stopped searching in Makati.  I found the girls there to be pretentious. They expected to be treated to expensive restaurants and trips to Boracay because the last foreign guy that screwed did that for them.  

That's why my first date was always coffee or something like that. I took my now fiance to Landers (equivalent to Costco) on our first date. We had a slice of pizza and a soda.  I never pretended to be something I wasn't. She said she liked my values and how I'd turn down potential customers and their money if I didn't genuinely feel like I could help them.  As things started to get better and better I did take her to nicer places but what I really liked is how she never *asked* nor expected it.

I would call on those who complain about Filipinas being gold diggers to take a little personal responsibility. It never ceases to amuse me how some guys will choose high-maintenance chicks with a Californian attitude and then complain when she expects to be treated to the best restaurants and any gift that costs less than $100 is an insult.   

When I was vetting a girl one of the first things I'd ask her is 'What does a good first date look like to you?'. If she rambled off expensive restaurants or doing expensive things then I knew she wasn't right for me.  That being said Filipinas tend to not be direct so they may say something like 'Oh I just want someone who loves me and accepts me for who I am'. That's also a lie and a red flag.  What I liked about my fiance is she said 'Well nowhere expensive but a comfortable place where I can look into his eyes and get to know him better'. I liked her so much after that because it was a genuine honest answer.  She's a public school teacher who would stand in front of a bus for her students. So for my fellow passport bros in the Philippines don't give up.  There are LOTS of good Filipinas out there. ",0,1730527160.0,thepassportbros,4,0.5,False

I don't know if I can call all of them narcissists but ever since studying the signs of narcissism, I seriously see them in every single member of my family. My siblings. My aunts and uncles. My cousins. Signs that I saw in my younger self.

There's this quote I really like about how, when you bump into someone and spill your cup of coffee, you would've spilled tea had it been in your cup instead. So when life shakes you, which is constantly will, the things that spill out were the things that were already inside you.

This entire year has just been me noticing all the spills. Toxicity. Insecurities. Ego. Self-centeredness. Inabilities to face their emotions or own up to their mistakes. How they don't hesitate for a second to use busy schedules or stress as an excuse for their bad deeds, as if they could rob a bank and be found innocent because of their heavy workloads.

I calculated how long it'll take me to save up enough money to move to another state and the answer seems to be five months.

I was responsible for all my flight and accommodation expenses. The cost of my dress and alterations ($500). And any affiliated costs for food and drinks on non-wedding-event days. 

The bride didn‚Äôt have a bachelorette. She‚Äôs having one on one of the nights at the resort which we‚Äôre required to pay $200 USD for a set menu (*not drinks). 

Of all wedding affiliated expenses she is only covering day of bridal party hair and makeup. 

The night before the wedding the couple is having an appetizer/drink event for wedding guests (which bride and groom have paid for) and then the bridal party is being asked to go back to the brides room for a sleepover / room service (unclear if I‚Äôll have to pay for any food I eat ordered after). 

Wedding day no food cost. 

The following day a cabana with all guests with food and drinks (unclear if I‚Äôll have to pay for what I eat/drink that day. 

I‚Äôm going for 7 days (6 nights) so I‚Äôve calculated if I bring coffee pods/bagels/snacks (literally to cut down on meal costs) I‚Äôll be paying an additional approx $350 USD to feed myself if meals I‚Äôm assuming she‚Äôs paying for are actually covered. If not it‚Äôll be even more for me to cover. This resort is very expensive and requires $100 deposits for the restaurants booked that act as a non-refundable minimum spend towards your bill. Plus any transportation expenses to and from the airport/anywhere. 

All together I‚Äôm projecting this wedding is going to cost me approximately $3500 CAD minimum once everything is said and done. 

Do I need to give the couple a gift? I feel horrible not and think it‚Äôll come off as super tacky / disrespectful but realistically this wedding is causing a huge financial strain on me when I already am going through a lot (bride is aware and hasn‚Äôt offered to help with expenses even though her parents are extremely well off and paying for everything).

At the same time I was reading a lot of HP Lovecraft. Hope others find my story at least somewhat funny. (Note, none of this reflects any reality! pure satire)

THE ELDER GODS OF AGILE by Cartoonybear

After ten years of computer science education, culminating in multiple advanced degrees, millions of dollars in student loans, and fuck-all in job prospects, I finally was offered a position at a federal government contractor called Cyclops.¬†

I was so desperate for a job, I overlooked many red flags‚Äîfrom the job description (‚ÄúWe desire new human meat flesh to help modernize infrastructures,‚Äù it began), to the interview, during which my interviewer had to ‚Äúgalvanize‚Äù himself multiple times with a cattle prod.

Fact was, I didn‚Äôt have much of a choice in the matter, so I said ‚Äúsure.‚Äù

On my first day, I showed up at 9am, and was greeted by a Cyclops VP, Dr. Thaumaturgist. He was a hideously deformed creature, the result (I later learned) of a horrific accident with the occult, whereby he‚Äôd attempted to use the dark powers of the Necronomicon to become the boot-licking toady of Nyarlahotep, but which only resulted in his becoming Cyclops‚Äô boot-licking VP of Federal.¬†

He walked me through the office, down a terrifying psychomantic corridor, to a bright room filled with cubicles, and pointed at one at random. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your desk. We had a guy quit last week, so we‚Äôre just plugging you in for him. Here‚Äôs the backlog.‚Äù He took a cord from the wall and inserted it into a port I hadn‚Äôt even been aware was actually installed on my lower back. He then handed me a large box filled with a bunch of index cards. I asked what they were.

‚ÄúJIRA tickets,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about reading them. You can‚Äôt make any sense out of them‚Äîyou have to use the JIRA browser extension, which overlays a bunch of shit over the cards.

‚ÄúBut‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúAlso, we don‚Äôt have a JIRA license, so you need to run JIRA in a virtual machine, which only runs on Windows, and is extremely slow, so you need a really beefy laptop. We don‚Äôt provide laptops, so you‚Äôll have to buy one.‚Äù

At this he gave an unsettling snort, which caused some sort of sticky stuff to ooze from the large hole in the side of his face. He went on, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be honest, our process is broken as shit. We actually have a bunch of stand-ups every day‚Äîa couple of Scrums, one for Kanban, one to discuss JIRA, one with our PM, one to discuss whatever random shit we did at yesterday‚Äôs stand-ups, etc.‚Äîso we‚Äôre all just super overloaded. I mean if we were expected to produce something, I‚Äôm not sure when we‚Äôd do it.¬†

‚ÄúBut hey, we got Booz and McKinsey in here so‚Äînot my monkeys, not my circus, y‚Äôknow, kid?!‚Äù He guffawed, catching the tip of his nose in one hand as it fell off, and wandered away.¬†

I had just settled into my desk, wondering what I should be doing since I didn‚Äôt have a computer, when a waxen-faced, stick-thin man peeped over the cube wall at me. ‚ÄúPsst‚Ä¶‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúOh, hi, I‚Äôm‚Ä¶‚Äù I began but he frantically shushed me. ‚ÄúHey, man, no names, okay? That‚Äôs how they can control us. Just refer to me as ‚ÄòScrum master.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, okay, uh, Scrum, I‚Äôm Full Stack,‚Äù I whispered back, peering around. The paranoia was catching.

‚ÄúCool, cool. We have another stand up in ten minutes, so I just want to get you oriented. We don‚Äôt actually do any real work‚Äîthat‚Äôs handled by a third-party in India, who probably aren‚Äôt even following the Scrum process. What we‚Äôre doing here is just pretending that we‚Äôre modernizing the customers infrastructure. If we have meetings and write JIRA tickets, the CTO on the client side can pretend that we‚Äôre doing agile. Then he can tell all the stakeholders that we‚Äôre following industry best practices. You‚Äôre cool with that, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess. Sounds like‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúFucked up? Yeah it‚Äôs¬†¬†fucked up. We actually used to do real work, but all that stopped when Cthulhu and the other Outer Gods returned to Earth in 2016.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, I‚Äôm not sure I heard about‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúShh!‚Äù he said, shaking a finger at me. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt even know, you were still in school.‚Äù

Just then, a man wearing a top hat and a monocle strode up. He was wearing an ancient three-piece suit with the vest unbuttoned, revealing his exposed ribcage. He peered into my cube. ‚ÄúHey, Full Stack,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúHi!‚Äù I said, trying not to be upset seeing his intestines underneath the waistcoat. He was the first person id seen in the office who wasn‚Äôt wearing business casual and it made me nervous I was under dressed.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm the Program Manager,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôve got a big present for you.‚Äù He grinned, exposing rows of razor-sharp teeth. He reached into his vest and drew out a large, brown, dried thing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the Gantt chart for the entire project. Printed on human skin!‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, that‚Äôs‚Ä¶.but‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúFull Stack! Get your coffee!‚Äù Interrupted Scrum master. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our third morning stand up!‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, okay, what do I do?‚Äù I asked, feeling more and more unprepared by the moment. I knew how to program, but that didn‚Äôt appear to be part of this job.¬†

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo the first thing is we stand in a circle. You start off by saying what you‚Äôre working on today, and then we take turns. Oh, and it‚Äôs not really important what we say‚Äîas long as we say something. Then, we drink coffee. Coffee with the heart of a child in it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt read the employee handbook? It‚Äôs in there. We have to drink coffee with the heart of a child in it. It‚Äôs a regular ceremony, some kind of team bonding thing. And then we‚Äôll stand in a circle and do some role-playing. Today we‚Äôre going to be playing the part of Azathoth.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúAzathoth. You know, the blind idiot god?‚Äù He furrowed his brow at me. ‚ÄúYou should probably read the employee handbook.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan we get this over with?‚Äù said the skeleton program manager in a bored tone. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm late for my sacrifice to Yog-Sothoth.‚Äù

Scrum master nodded and we walked to the meeting room. When we got there, there were about 12 people in the room, all standing in a circle. I was the only new person, so everyone looked at me.

‚ÄúHey, team!‚Äù said Scrum master, as he clapped his hands together. ‚ÄúWe have a new member‚Äînumber 13! today‚ÄîFull Stack, why don‚Äôt you introduce yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said, giving an awkward wave. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Full Stack, I‚Äôm a developer.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great,‚Äù said Scrum master. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll go around the circle. Say your role only, heh heh, don‚Äôt want ‚Äòem knowing how to liquefy the old brain, right? And then, tell us what demon you most relate to.¬†

‚ÄúOh and don‚Äôt forget to say the words ‚Äòagile‚Äô or ‚ÄòJIRA‚Äô at some point. Booz Allen is videotaping this today for auditing and compliance. Okay go!‚Äù¬†

It seemed to take an eternity. Everyone made a bunch of elaborate hand gestures and used incomprehensible vocabulary from Jira, and then we moved on to the ‚Äúcoffee ceremony.‚Äù Scrum master had brought along a big thermos of coffee and, one by one, everyone walked over to him and got a cup. Scrum master handed me a cup, and when I took a sip, I nearly spat it out. It was the most godawful, rank liquid I‚Äôd ever tasted, and I noticed floating in it a small brown clump.

‚ÄúWow,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHow do you drink this stuff?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou get used to it,‚Äù said Scrum master. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been doing this for a few years now. And it doesn‚Äôt get any easier.‚Äù He looked down at the brown clump. ‚ÄúOh look! First day and you got the child heart! Well, aren‚Äôt YOU favored?‚Äù¬†

After the coffee, Scrum master got out a book of role-playing games and began handing out cards. ‚ÄúToday we‚Äôre going to be Azathoth. Azathoth is the blind idiot god, he is an amorphous mass who lies dreaming on the throne of the Outer Gods.‚Äù

He divided us into two groups‚Äîone group was going to be Azathoth and the other group was going to ask him questions. ‚ÄúRemember,‚Äù he said, as he handed out the cards, ‚Äúyou have to use your imagination, and you can‚Äôt improvise.‚Äù¬†

It was the weirdest goddamned thing I‚Äôve ever seen. We were trying to figure out what we were supposed to do as Azathoth, and everyone was confused. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even sure what the Outer Gods are,‚Äù I whispered to Scrum master.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre, like, gods that are outside of time and space,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure either, I just do this shit.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho are the Outer Gods?‚Äù asked one of the role-players.

‚ÄúI am the Outer Gods,‚Äù replied one of the Azathoths. ‚ÄúAll the Outer Gods are me.‚Äù

It went on like this for another hour or so. I just kept drinking child-heart coffee and nodding along.¬†

Finally we broke for lunch, and I went to get a sandwich at a nearby Subway along with most of the other people in the office.¬†

When we came back, Scrum master looked like he‚Äôd been crying, but no one said anything. ‚ÄúGreat news!‚Äù Scrum yelled. ‚ÄúMcKinsey sent us a new process to use! We‚Äôre going to Kanban now!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù asked another developer who‚Äôd introduced himself as Front End (Level II),¬†

‚ÄúKanban!‚Äù Scrum Master screamed hysterically. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Japanese word that means‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what it means! I guess it‚Äôs a type of process!¬†

‚ÄúAnyway, all you need to know is we‚Äôre not going to do Scrum anymore. Instead, we‚Äôre going to do Kanban.‚Äù¬†

As he spoke, he was almost absentmindedly tearing up a piece of paper I hadn‚Äôt noticed before. (‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs his Scrum Master certification,‚Äù Front End whispered to me.)¬†

‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre not going to have daily Scrums, instead, we‚Äôre going to have Kanban stand-ups. But other than that, everything‚Äôs the same. Just like Scrum. Everything‚Äôs going to be the same.¬†

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still going to do fake work, we‚Äôre still going to have stand-ups, we‚Äôre still going to be pretending to follow industry best practices. Only now we have new words for everything!‚Äù

The team stared at him..¬†

Just then a man who looked like a cross between the Grim Reaper and your old high school gym teacher sidled up to us. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the Kanban coach,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI heard you had some questions about Kanban.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Scrum master. ‚ÄúI was just explaining how Kanban is like Scrum, but better, and how a Scrum Master can run a Kanban‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù interrupted the Coach. ‚ÄúScrum is not like Kanban. Kanban is about flow. We‚Äôre going to use the Kanban board to show flow. It‚Äôs going to be awesome.‚Äù

I had horrible dreams that night.¬†

The next day, when I sat down at my desk (still without a computer) I was surprised to notice that my only friend, Scrum Master, was gone, and appeared to have cleared out his whole cubicle. Just then Dr. Thaumaturgy strolled by. ‚ÄúOh, Full Stack! Glad I ran into you. Emergency All Hands at 1300 hours, in Blood.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, I‚Äôm sorry sir, in what?‚Äù

Dr. T. laughed heartily. ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs the big conference room just outside the kitchen! You‚Äôll get used to it all soon. Gristle is the little conference room under the stairs, and Sebum is the medium sized conference room near my office. See you then!‚Äù And Dr. T.¬†ambled off, leaving me more bewildered than before.

At 1300 hours, I joined the rest of the company in Blood, where Program Manager Skeletor was addressing us.

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôve got good news and I‚Äôve got bad news,‚Äù he wheezed, fingering his human skin project schedule obsessively. ‚ÄúGood news is we‚Äôre going to be doing pair programming.‚Äù

Everyone stared at him. I wondered if I was the only one who didn‚Äôt understand what this was.

‚ÄúBad news is‚Ä¶ uh, I don‚Äôt have any bad news.‚Äù

I raised my hand tentatively. ‚ÄúUh, is Scrum Master out sick?‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad everyone‚Äôs excited about pair programming.‚Äù

I guessed my question hadn‚Äôt been heard. That‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôm a team player who doesn‚Äôt cause problems.¬†

The PM continued.¬†¬†‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre going to be using a new style of pair programming, where the two programmers write their code, naked, in a bathtub full of blood. Let‚Äôs get started, everyone!‚Äù He threw a banana at my head and when I opened my mouth in shock, he threw a Duplo block in my mouth, choking me. The other staff snickered as they filed out of the room. ‚ÄúHey, he really got you,‚Äù said one woman.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it, it‚Äôs just hazing,‚Äù Front End reassured me in the men‚Äôs room where I went to try and dislodge the Duplo in my throat.¬†

At the end of the week, I asked the guy who now sat next to me, a tall man who resembled a shambling mound, about how we got our paychecks.¬†

‚ÄúOh, they don‚Äôt give out paychecks here,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúUh, what?‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs like an experiment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe stopped giving out paychecks during COVID, and nobody who complained came back to work, so they just, you know, stopped. But we do have some pretty nice benefits. We have beer on tap in the kitchen, and every April Fools there‚Äôs a pretend bonus, which is pretty funny.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I said, and then asked the only question I could think of. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the program manager‚Äôs name again?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, him?‚Äù said Shambling Mound. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs R‚ÄôLyeh. You need to talk to dread Chthulhu, you‚Äôre going through him first. Hey, have a great weekend, man!‚Äù",2,1730526828.0,agile,0,1.0,False
1ghpybc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ghpybc/the_most_important_person_in_my_life_confessed_to/,The most important person in my life confessed to me on our texas roadhouse date tonight that he killed someone.,"Backstory: My bestfriend (m29) and I (f29) have been close since high school. We fell madly in love and dated for years, but split in 2020 when his addiction to heroin became dangerous. I stuck by him through everything, remaining close friends. Platonic soulmates.
I endlessly have  given more than I have received since we split, because I had hope ""he"" was still in there and that love he used to give me would return. It's pretty pathetic how much I've sacrificed. I even flew to the other side of the country TWICE to see him while he was in rehab and it wasn't cheap. I've tried to date a few times, because I am a hopeless romantic and his loving , sexual side was gone.. and it turned out VERY badly. Not only was he jealous of them, but they felt I wasn't over him, and it created pain for everyone and I decided not to date at all. This caused resentment to build and we drifted apart but would make up again. He knew he was all I had. Everyone by then had abandoned me. 

In May, after a facade of him being romantic again to my touch/attention starved self , I lashed out-badly. He had given me false hope by kissing my neck while he  played our song from years ago. When I tried to be loving back, He called me a parasite. We didn't speak for days. I went and picked him up, we talked and it was weird. Different. He offered to leave me a baggy of something ""for later"" (after I brought him home). I was inpatient and did a tiny line before I was supposed to drive him home. I woke up to state police and emts, I almost died from fentanyl.  He coached me to refuse to go to the hospital, telling them he had a backup narcan and would spend the night with me so they left. They had warned me how bad I was, and how when the 3 they used on me would wear off I could have an emergency again and needed to be monitored. 
I could barley move or talk, my body was drenched because he put me in my shower. I wasn't ok. When they left, he kissed me and He asked that if anyone asked, I tell people I had a seizure and he called 911. Then said he had a ride home and left me. Told me not to fall asleep, but I had felt like someone shot nyquil in my veins. I fell asleep. We've been ""not okay"" since. Always fighting . 

He got REALLY bad in late August and almost died by suicide. I'm close to his family and I was the only one they let around him after he was released from the hospital. I picked him up to go get coffee and talk , but as soon as we left his driveway, he was on the phonewith a plug and I did a u turn and floored it back to his house, cussing him out . His mom came out when we pulled in duke's of hazard style and I was crying and screaming- inconsolable. He took off on foot. His mom told me to stay with her , but I left. He returned home hours later , agreeing to try rehab again. The next day,  his mom texted me he stole her vehicle,  and was in a car accident. He messaged me bloody selfies In an ambulance. I never got the full story. I've looked , and cant find any articles about the crash. He went to a 90 day rehab, and is now in a halfway house. I haven't seen him (until tonight) , but we have messaged back and forth and he's begged to see me but I didn't. His mom hasn't contacted me. 

TODAY: I had a stressful day at work and decided to treat myself akd go see terrifier 3. He had been begging to see me and talk in person,  and I finally agreed. When I got out of work, we had about 2 hours before the movie started so we went to texas roadhouse.  He told me in the car accident, he was on fentanyl and benzos. He hit another car head on, with an older woman and her granddaughter inside. He told me the older woman had died. He said he's waiting on sentencing in court and could be charged with murder / vehicular manslaughter and might kill himself or spend 15-life in prison. I pretended to have to pee and went to the bathroom and puked my food. I didn't know what to say . We went to the movies, and I sat and watched one of the most grotesque films ever made beside the person I devoted myself to, who was now...a killer. He hugged me and and begged to see me again. I drove off and I haven't been ok since . Nobody has said anything about this, it's not in the paper or his arrest from the crash. 

I don't know what to do,  think or feel. I'm lost. I'm broken. I'm heartbroken for that girl. For the old woman. My heart feels sorry for him. My brain is scattered. I don't know if I even believe it....it's a sick mindfuck either way. ..",1,1730526800.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

-> Would start using dating apps, the more intimate we got. Refused to address it, telling me my anxious attachment would ruin it for us when I brought it up. But then would also get jealous when she found out I had been on a single coffee date with another girl the week we met.

A few of you may be interested in this.  When my daughter and later my son was born we decided to plant coffee trees as some kind of memento.  It seemed like a good idea at the time/s.  After 12 years (yes 12 years) they finally bore fruit!  Admittedly I have made little effort to promote their growth over the 12 years, but about 7 years in we cut down an oak tree at the request of our neighbours, and after that the coffee trees seemed to flourish.  We live in New Zealand on the lower slopes (the house is founded on a crust of basaltic lava) of a dormant volcano, so I originally had some ill informed idea that Coffee would be ideal, despite there being no commercial plantations in NZ.

My wife decided to embark on a project to make coffee from the coffee beans and so did some research.  My contribution was documenting it and going to the gym while she and my little slave children did all the work.  I documented it on Instagram at the time and one  my friends suggested making kopi  luwak.  As then I learned that it‚Äôs really hard to import Luwaks into NZ, so I asked my Bengal Tige if he‚Äôd help out.  Being part Asian Leopard Cat and closely related to Civets (probably)  I thought he‚Äôd be keen, but he‚Äôs not a native english speaker, so I never figured out what he was thinking sadly, but pretty sure it was a no.

After about 3 weeks of berry picking, drying, degassing, husking and finally roasting on a bbq (probably 5-8 hours manual labour) we had enough for about 2-3 double shots.  The beans were tiny and bare,y even looked like beans.  My son was especially excited and smothered his in cream from a can, took one sip and decided he didn‚Äôt like coffee.  

What did it taste like ?  Nutty, certainly not bad, but not that much like store bought beans.

Will we ever do it again?  Probably not, but the trees look like they are starting to fruit again.",6,1730526416.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC üòÖ I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

Halos live in na kami pero nasa bahay kami ng parents ko. Kilala na namin both of our families. We have pets together. He was a green flag, a nice guy, the kind of guy na you would never think is capable of cheating. He would never make me doubt until 2 years ago. I found out he was liking inappropriate posts of some girl he knew. When I asked who was the girl, nakatira daw malapit sa office nila and he sees her sometimes but never actually interacted with her (accdg to him). When I found out, I messaged the girl first to ask her if she was the one that added my bf on facebook and she said no. So I confronted him and he told me the girl added him (idk but I think a girl/stranger with no commitment to me wouldn't lie abt that so ofc I believed her) and then tinanong ko siya bakit niya nilalike yung posts nung girl, his responses were disappointing. Ofc dineny niya and even gaslighted me at some point. His main concern was bakit ko pa daw kailangan tanungin or kausapin yung girl nakakahiya daw baka daw kumalat sa workplace niya. I get it but can he blame me? The posts were inappropriate and nakakakuha ng 'haha' react sakanya then some posts may 'care' react? Anong dapat kong isipin? Obv iisipin ko nagpapapansin siya but he denied it for days. I told him hindi ako naninwala na wala lang yun. My gut says may something so di ko siya tinigilan. Then eventually he confessed. Nagpapansin daw siya kasi napansin niya na may gusto sakanya yung girl kasi tinatanong daw yung name niya sa coworkers niya and nakikita niya nakatingin sakanya then sabi niya gusto niya daw malaman kung may iba pang nagkakagusto sakanya kasi lagi ko daw pinaparamdam sakanya na di na ko attracted or na napapangitan na daw ako bc I used to joke around telling him na 'ang panget mo' but it wasn't true. I was just really joking and I never knew he took it seriously. I know that was wrong and it took a toll on his insecurities but I know that that is not an excuse to seek validation from other women. 

It was such a big deal to me. I know maliit na bagay lang yun para sa iba, he just liked/reacted to some posts, compared sa kalokohan ng ibang lalake, ni wala silang chats (nagsend yung girl ng sc ng convo nila and it was empty) and walang physical interaction but the intention was there. He wanted to cheat, takot lang siya sa consequences. I don't want a man like that. Gusto pero takot lang kaya hindi ginagawa. I want a man who doesn't cheat simply because he doesn't want to. 

Another thing why it was a big deal and I still couldn't move on from that after 2 years was when he was doing that, when he was fantasizing about other women, when he was wondering if he had a chance with her, I was reviewing for my board exam that time. Probably the most important exam in my life and apart from that my grandfather was hospitalized and died a few days later. He was with me while I was reviewing, buying me coffee, bringing me food, he was with me when I was having anxiety and maybe a little bit depressed. He was also with me when I visited my lolo in the hospital, he was with me when he was dying, he was with me when he died and took care of some things for me too. He did all that while thinking of another woman and seeking her attention. Hindi ko magets paano nila nagagawa yun. Yun yung lagi kong naiisip. He could do a lot of things for you, he could put in a lot of effort all while he's cheating on you. 

Micro cheating man o hindi. Cheating is cheating. I felt utterly disrespected. 2 years later, hindi ko parin makalimutan. I need your opinions. ",9,1730525678.0,adviceph,5,0.91,False

""When your a grown man and still have yet to feel a woman's touch, I beseech you to never stray off of your morals and principles As in waiting a whole lifetime will always in the end be stronger and more pure in the way we think about and experience true love.""



Its been a grueling last two weeks, but finally, I'm home. It was a duplex on a quiet little street on the outskirts of our small community here, Hudson. The duplex had 2 other tennants a woman and a man. The landlord didn't really tell me much about them except that the man has been here for a while and the woman has taken residence here right before I did. A woman. As a 33 year old virgin the idea of living in the same house with a girl excited me. Maybe I'll get to know her overtime I thought. Maybe we'll become friends and hang out sometimes. Maybe this new chapter of my life will turn out good for once, I could only hope.


The sun was setting on a beautiful October 9th sky. A nice breeze flowed through my new home from the opened windows all over the apartment. The smell of the autumn air filled my lungs as I sat on my recliner and relaxed with a cold beer and some pizza while watching playoff baseball. The Detroit tigers had a nice 3 run lead against Cleveland guardians. In this moment everything seemed pretty perfect. It felt so good to be in a new home. My own home. After the game ended I turned off the TV and went to my bed to sleep. But when I went to turn off my lamp I heard a knock on the door.



I got up and answered the door. But to my surprise no one was there. I looked down the hall both ways. To my left was the front door and my right was the stairs that went to up to my neighbors apartment. Ahead of me across the hallway was where the woman lived. As I looked back and forth a couple times I went back inside and locked up and called it a night. Hmm maybe some kids or something I didn't think much of it and layed down and drifted peacefully to sleep.

I woke around 8:30am. The sun rays coating my upper chest and face was a pleasant way to greet the new day. After a nice long shower I went to my kitchen to get some food, leftover pizza. After I was done I headed to the front door. There was some stuff I needed for the new place. As soon as I entered my living room I heard something. It was quiet but I knew exactly what it was. It was the sound of people having sex.


A quick glance to my left I found the source. It was my TV. And after studying the screen for a few seconds I realized it was my porn that was playing. I didn't remember watching this last night. I drank quite a bit but I remembered the end of last night. The knock. Nobody there. And then brushing it off and hitting the hay. I guess I just don't remember it, not that part. I concluded. I Then popped the DVD out and turned everything off. After that I left. On my way out I seen only my car was here. When will I get to meet my neighbors? I thought as I drove away from the property.



I got home 2 hours later and seen that nobody was still here. While walking up to the front stoop, a car pulled in. A Toyota corolla. I watched them park and gave them a friendly wave, it was hard to see the person through the window glare. After a few seconds a man got out. He had a hat on backwards with Levi jeans and a red faded shirt, covered by a red checkeredless flannel. In his hands he held his keys and a bag of groceries or something. I waved again, thinking he didn't see me the first time. He waved back and I waited for him as he walked up to the house.



""Hi there"" he said while approaching.

""Hey, how's it going"" I replied

""Its good, I take it your the new guy?""

""Yea just moved in last night."" I said while shuffling my bags around in my hands.

""Cool nice to meet ya, I'm upstairs, my name is Vore."" 

""Nice to meet ya man I'm dennis.""
 I propped the door open with a door stopper with my feet for him to enter. After we both got inside we put our bags down In The narrow hallway and shook hands. A group of kids walked by outside and distracted both of us as they were being loud and goofing off. I grabbed my bags while watching them pass by through the doorway. 

""Hey, umm later on around 1 I'm gonna be popping a bottle and watching the game, so if you get bored or whatever your more than welcome to come down and chill out if you want man.""

He was already walking away on his way upstairs when he turned around and said ""Okay, I'll keep that in mind friend.""

He continued up the stairs and I heard him shut his door behind him. 

I walked into my home, feeling significantly better that I finally met one of my neighbors. Then I wondered when I'll meet the girl across the hall. Just let it happen naturally like my encounter with vore did. I thought what a strange name, never met someone with that name before. After putting away my groceries and new home items I realized one of the bags weren't mine. The contents were just one item, a bundle of short flowers. With a closer look it seemed they were freshly pulled with roots and all.


I quickly understood why I had this bag. It was vore's. I must have accidently grabbed it while collecting my own. On my way to his apartment I seen another car pull in from my living room window. It's her I bet. I contemplated taking vores bag to him right away as I might miss the chance to meet her. Eventually I decided to say screw it, she fucking lives here! I will meet her at one time or another inevitably so I just took myself to vores door. As I was walking up the stairs I heard the front door open up. I kept walking to vores door though determined to return his bag to him.
When I got to the landing that led 10 feet towards his door, I heard the noise of sex again. 


As I creeped closer to make sure I actually heard what I heard, the sound diminished. And then it was silent, until the sound of a door closing downstairs broke it. I decided to just walk up and knock on the door. When I got there it felt very warm, light shined through the cracks of the door and it smelled different than downstairs. It smelled sweet. Right when I went to knock I heard a sound inside. It was a gasp, loud and defeating. Then a long loud exhale. I stood there with my fist in the air. Then all of a sudden the warm air got chilled. Like a ac was blowing directly at the door. A few seconds went by and I heard talking. 


As I stood there ready to knock I listened hard. And the voice said, ""have you seen it?""

It was solid and medium in volume, continued over again. The cold air kept creeping through the door. And the hallway was silent except for that one phrase repeating again. ""Have you seen it?"" 

It was vore. Talking to himself, and just repeating that same line over and over again.

""Have you seen it?"" ""Have you seen it?"" ""Have you seen it??""have you seen it???""
The whole time his voice seemed weak. But still loud as he delivered the words with innocence until they turned to malice. Until he stopped altogether. This is freaky I thought. Should I just drop the bag at his doorstep? Or give it to him in person? I went for the former and just left. The cold air mixed into warm as I left in the upstairs hallway. Then went back inside my home.


A couple days passed since that weird situation. And still no random meeting with the woman of the house. She seemed to be avoiding me I thought. O well

The next day I was off again. Full week vacation is beautiful. And finally I can have a friend come by. Still haven't met mystery girl from across the hall. It was too much so I decided to hang with some guys. Some friends.  We met up, at a bar outside of town. A nice low lake pub, about 10 miles from my home. We had some drinks and decided to take the small party back to Hudson. When we got there as usual the others cars were absent. So we fumbled into my home while being quite drunk during the time. As we got in and settled my friend chilled out on the couch while I got drinks.  Until a knock happened upon the door. 


Me, yelling from the kitchen said ""get the door will ya?""  And a view downrange showed him answer the door. I continued shuffling around the kitchen until I was ready to return to the living room. When I did return he was gone. So I checked the bathroom and he wasn't there. I checked the master room just incase he passed out on my bed for some reason but he wasn't there. So I went into the hall.


When I looked out into the hallway I seen feet climbing the stairs. It was cut off and I nonchalantly called for him.

""Jake""
"" yoo Jake what are you doing man?""
He kept walking up
As I walked towards the stairs I kept calling his name. ""Jake, hey jake?"" 
When i got to the base of the stairs I seen the back of a head retreat into the darkness of the top hallway. 
""Jake what the hell are you doing man?""
No response from the dark.
""Jake"" cmon man"" 
Still nothing
At that moment I heard it again, it was faint but making it's point. It was sex sounds again.
I look back at the long hallway that connected everyone here, but the sound was muffled. As I backtracked, the sound got louder. Until I was in front of my door.



I left my door cracked, and from the room the sounds of passionate lovemaking seeped through the opening like it's been waiting a lifetime to expose. When I checked, it was mine again, set up and playing full blast. The other dvds from the set layed on my coffee table, all face up. I looked around, trying to find someone. Someone who shouldn't be here.  
""Alright show yourself here right now before I call the cops"" I had no weapons or guns. 
 that was easy to say until I realized my friend is still upstairs alone. I hope he was alone.


No matter how scared I was at this moment I had only one obligation. It was to get my boy back from the upstairs. So I trudged upstairs to confront the situation first hand. After pounding on the door for a minute i heard a voice from the bottom of the stairs. It's said loudly ""are you okay?""

I turned back, and ran back to the top looking down the stairs a shadow ridden woman, her body cloaked in dark shade as her face popped out with soft light gently revealing her face from the hallway glow. When she stepped forward closer, I knew it had to be the neighbor girl. 


"" your the neighbor? I need your help quickly!"" She looked at me confused then slowly started walking up the stairs. 

""My friend walked in here earlier, this is vores home, I don't know why he went it or how but he's in there. Please help me get him out.""
She keeps slowly ascending the stairs while locking eyes with me. 
""the door is locked, idk why but I know my friend came up here.""
The girl continued climbing the stairs, are you gonna help me? I thought, her eyes stood still while the rest of her body seemed to move. 
""Did you see it?""
She asked calmly 
""What?""
""See what?""

""Did you see it?"" She said while slowly walking towards me

Each step she took throught the dark stairway, she revealed herself more.

Shirt and pants dropping, as she walzed towards me, each time she stepped she seemed more motivated while slowly dropping her clothes. Through the darkness. 

Eventually she was completely nude. And approaching me.

""What?"" I splurted out, now backing up the stairs.

""He saw it. Why can't you?

After a few seconds I realized I was trapped with my back to vore's door.

""Please my friend, he needs help."" I pleaded hoping for a peaceful resolution 

""You will see it."" 
""Come with me""
""Come be with me and forget all this""
She flaunted her naked body at me
I kept backing up until I hit the door
She moved up on me
""No"" 
I exclaimed while dodging her hand
She reached out and I fell backwards
The door opened
I fell straight to the floor
My head snapped back while falling, then I   Twisted myself straight to see
I rubbed my eyes and looked foward
Old music flooded my brain while the smell of deep sour assaulted my senses. The ground had normal carpet, until I looked  farther.
And then I saw it.

Halos live in na kami pero nasa bahay kami ng parents ko. Kilala na namin both of our families. We have pets together. He was a green flag, a nice guy, the kind of guy na you would never think is capable of cheating. He would never make me doubt until 2 years ago. I found out he was liking inappropriate posts of some girl he knew. When I asked who was the girl, nakatira daw malapit sa office nila and he sees her sometimes but never actually interacted with her (accdg to him). When I found out, I messaged the girl first to ask her if she was the one that added my bf on facebook and she said no. So I confronted him and he told me the girl added him (idk but I think a girl/stranger with no commitment to me wouldn't lie abt that so ofc I believed her) and then tinanong ko siya bakit niya nilalike yung posts nung girl, his responses were disappointing. Ofc dineny niya and even gaslighted me at some point. His main concern was bakit ko pa daw kailangan tanungin or kausapin yung girl nakakahiya daw baka daw kumalat sa workplace niya. I get it but can he blame me? The posts were inappropriate and nakakakuha ng 'haha' react sakanya then some posts may 'care' react? Anong dapat kong isipin? Obv iisipin ko nagpapapansin siya but he denied it for days. I told him hindi ako naninwala na wala lang yun. My gut says may something so di ko siya tinigilan. Then eventually he confessed. Nagpapansin daw siya kasi napansin niya na may gusto sakanya yung girl kasi tinatanong daw yung name niya sa coworkers niya and nakikita niya nakatingin sakanya then sabi niya gusto niya daw malaman kung may iba pang nagkakagusto sakanya kasi lagi ko daw pinaparamdam sakanya na di na ko attracted or na napapangitan na daw ako bc I used to joke around telling him na 'ang panget mo' but it wasn't true. I was just really joking and I never knew he took it seriously. I know that was wrong and it took a toll on his insecurities but I know that that is not an excuse to seek validation from other women.

I've just arrived home after I experienced probably one of the greatest days life has to offer.

I need a way to share and discuss my thoughts and positivity on my newly acquired grasp of absurdist Philosophy. 

Until now, I thought of Absurdism as a way to cope with the absence of meaning, the conflict between the human endless search for meaning and the universe's inability or indifferentness to provide us with such. 

I am aware that humans have a weird and unhealthy desire to connect unrelated events, which were just scattered out by the universe, that just couldn't possibly give a bigger Fuck. The biggest of the Fucks of all, the ultimate Fuck to ever be not given.

I am aware of all of that, the boulder, destined death, the rebel against committing the big silly, bla, bla, bla...

And then came one of the most amazing days I experienced in a long time, which strengthened my absurdist ""beliefs"" but not in the way I expected. Please share if you've ever had any similar experiences, thoughts or whatever you want say.

So this post is a way to share, discuss, log and spread my positive outlook and the aftermath of this great and confusing day.





I won't recap the day without going into great detail, but here it comes if anyone is interested in the aforementioned day (If not then skip this part, there will be a TL;DR) :

Three of my friends and I had spontaneously decided that we wanted to take a trip to Cologne, our favourite neighbouring city. We didn't make any plans for this day except for strolling, food and beer. So two hours later we met at the train station and hopped on the train. We weren't excited, because it wasn't our first trip to that city, but we enjoyed the ride because there are worse things than taking a train ride through moody Autumn.

On the train ride there, I received an E-mail that I was accepted at the Job I enlisted myself for. I was more relieved than happy because this meant the end of my 1-year streak of turndowns. 

After arriving at our destination, we didn't know what to do so we went for coffee. 

The coffee was excellent, when not a bit pricy. One of my friends discovered his new passion for Chai Latte, which made this visit worth every penny.

We left satisfied and went to a nearby park to smoke some cigarettes. The park had a great playground that our inner child couldn't resist.

Our mood was up and we decided that we were hungry. We settled for Indian cuisine because they have great vegan options which is relevant for some of us, and we wanted to convince our other friend that there is other great food out there than Pizza and Lasagna.

We luckily got a table at a place that, at the telephone, couldn't assure us that there was space for us so we had to come by and look for ourselves.

We sat down, ordered and were completely stunned by the food. We all synonymously agreed that it was probably the best food we had in a long time. We all shared our food with one another, which made the whole experience so harmonic and perfect which left us all at a loss for words after we left the place.

After we had left, we went to grab some beers at a bar that we wanted to check out for some time now.

We sat down, ordered and this was when we first noticed how good this day had turned out. How seemingly all stars were aligned, so we could experience this day. How so many little trifles and nudges worked in harmony, that made this day possible. 

We strolled through the city for another hour looking for baklava but got distracted by every other bar, shop and other stuff that attracted our attention. 

Shortly after we went to the train station to head back home, when suddenly we found a place that sold the Turkish sweets we were looking for. 

On the train ride home we ate our baklava and played our own version of ""Mafia/Werewolf"". We laughed so much the whole time that all of a sudden the train ride was over.

We smoked another couple of cigarettes and talked over the day and all those little coincidences that made this day so fucking special before everyone went their own way home. 

Not one of us was sad that this day ended, our brains were flooded with endorphins even throughout the last hours because we knew that those memories could never be taken away from us. 

We talked through every little coincidence which led to our decision. But ultimately we concluded it was sheer ""luck"".

The feeling I had when coming home was as if I had seen a great movie at the cinema. It leaves you speechless, overwhelmed but not in any way sad.

This day was not special in a conventional sense, this day was like any other through an outer perspective. We took a train, had coffee, food, beers and cigarettes and called it a day. Not special in my book, if you ask me. We participated in literally the most everyday life activities, but maybe it was the simplicity, low expectations, the acceptance of what life brought upon us, following our instincts and not being afraid of new experiences, even if their as small as a Chai latte and Indian Food. We, for the love of God, could have never expected what life has to offer but were ready when we hopped on that train. 



TL;DR: My friends and I had unexpectedly the most amazing day, even though we just had food, some beers and took a walk through a city. 





Alright. 

This whole day was retro perspectively the most absurd day as I know of. For the first time in my life, I saw absurdism, first row, live and in colour, with my own eyes. The most I understood of Absurdism was that the Universe can't hear you scream or if so, couldn't care less. It sprinkles its little bullshit here and there and if you're not careful enough you die. This isn't bad luck or something, it's just how shit goes around here. Look up to the stars and you're gone. You are born screaming and shitting yourselves and this is the same way you spend and end your life. 

But sometimes the universe unknowingly pulls a little prank on you, and suddenly, without warning lets you and your friends experience one of the most beautiful days one could ever experience. Just like that. Don't blink or you'll miss it. This would be the day I would try to remember every little detail of detail from if I ever get sentenced to death row. 

But for now, it feels so much easier to treat life's little inconveniences with the same indifference it treats you. The Boulder can kiss my ass and I can't wait for it to roll down again.",4,1730524498.0,Absurdism,1,1.0,False

1ghpds6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1ghpds6/relationship_with_my_unhappily_married_boss/,Relationship with my  unhappily married boss,"This has been bothering me for a while so Sharing it here

I have joined company 2 years back . Me 25M and my boss 37F
So over the last 1.5 years we have became very close and she shared many things with me. 
By close means I‚Äôll explain 
1. She cares for me genuinely like if I am sick she will check up on me will bring medicines for me also
2. She sometimes brings lunch for me in office 
3. She helps me a lot in work also because of her I‚Äôve become very good at my job
4. Once she got upset because she came to know that many times I don‚Äôt wear seatbelt in car and was very upset that I am so careless 
And such many things 

But slowly slowly something more happened she said I haven‚Äôt met someone so gentle and caring like you and she said I like you very much .
She is very unhappy in marriage and shared with me and cried many times 
After a while I don‚Äôt know I also felt something for her I‚Äôll skip the middle part so in the end  from last 4 months we started things a bit physical like she would kiss me or play with my hair or hold my hand 
This all in office only nothing outside of office possible 
Since I‚Äôve never been relationship this felt very nice and comfortable. 
One day we talked about how wish we get the opportunity for sleeping with each other.
We both knew it won‚Äôt be possible so we just used to talk or chat about it 

Like I told she was unhappy in marriage so she used to share many times before our this stage when we just normal close friends about how horrible the sex with her husband feels how he doesn‚Äôt care if it is pleasing her or not.
She said I want him to kiss me, hold me and have passionate sex but he isn‚Äôt like that 
So she avoids sleeping with him and they sleep in separate rooms as much as possible to the point her husband went to prostitution once and later he shared with her to which she said if that is what you are going to do then never ask me again I‚Äôve no problem but he didn‚Äôt continue that.

So once in two months she does out of obligation because if she denies he will take anger on their child so she says I just lay there till he gets his deed done. I used to feel bad for her.

But one day actually we got chance to have sex and it was good and she said I feel so loved.
She was genuinely very happy

So after few days while chatting she said to me 
Today he is asking for it and I have already avoided it for many days if I don‚Äôt do it now he will become very angry so she did and messaged me afterwards saying she cried during this and said I hated every minute of it wishing it was you. That time i just comforted her.

But after few days I told her that this doesn‚Äôt feel right you are married and I don‚Äôt understand how you say you hate his touch and still have sex with him
She said you are correct it might feel like this to you and your feeling are valid but I‚Äôm trapped I can‚Äôt leave this marriage right now once my kid grows up I‚Äôll leave him 
So she said 
1. I feel a bit silly that I want to be with you yet I‚Äôm doing it with someone else although out of obligation but still I‚Äôm doing it na 
2. She said I feel bit guilty that I‚Äôm trapping an innocent like you in my mess 
3. But I just like you so much and also don‚Äôt know how to be with you and I wish you get full woman not half aunty like me
4. So I understand if you want to stop 
5. She said this physical stuff is overpowering our friendship and making things complicated we better stay friends then

So we continued without it for few days so I between I asked her what if tomorrow I go to prostitute , how will you feel she said I would a be a bit sad but we are also not in relationship so for me to become sad doesn‚Äôt make sense and I want to give all the pleasure to you and I want to see you happy that‚Äôs all but since I can‚Äôt give you I have no right to say anything about your choices 
And I know you will be going there for physical urge only since I can‚Äôt give it you I know you still care for me I won‚Äôt feel bad anything about it 

Things went like this for few days but we again started to crave each others touch and slowly started again 
And after a while again in back of my mind I was always having few thoughts I asked her 
What if you get urge yourself what do you do ? She said most of the time I pleasure myself but when in house both are in good mood I ask him then I said on one hand you are saying you don‚Äôt like to do it with him and you asking for it 
She said to this I don‚Äôt have any other source I can‚Äôt go to prostitutes like men can go 

One more thing she also told me about other things like few years back she started having feelings for other office colleagues but for the first time when he approached to her for kissing she was repulsed by it because she said she wanted emotional connection and all he wanted was physical which she didn‚Äôt like.

So for few days everything was normal 
And we used to come office early so that we can spend more time together and 1-2 times went to washroom after which she felt horrible she said it feels very desperate and our friendship is not based on sex it is more than that so we decided to never do it again so again we just simply kissed each other once in while

But one day her husband was out of town so she asked me to come home and we had coffee and watched some tv and then decided to do it and both were happy 

But one day in office only(we come early so no one sees us )  I think someone saw us while I hugged her 
She got terrified and me too so this was the last time we decided we will do something stupid 
Let‚Äôs stop everything.

So few days back again she had fight with her husband over small thing and shared with me
Her husband asked for a hug and she denied 
She said I do so much for him and I said to him let‚Äôs go trip somewhere which he doesn‚Äôt want to do 
I said to her you should have given hug she said yes but if we go for hug he will asks for sex also which I absolutely don‚Äôt want 
Then I asked her but eventually how many days you can avoid what if he asked again
To which she said I will do sex with him because otherwise things get even worse I just want to keep a decent environment in my house 

So this time the feeling that this doesn‚Äôt feel right was very strong to me it was always at back of mind that after all she is married this is not right but since I have never been in relationship I always liked the how she comforted me or and genuinely cared for me.
So this emotional things overpowered my rational thinking 

So finally told her that this doesn‚Äôt feel right to me what we are doing 
She said : yes you are right . This is very odd and doesn‚Äôt make any sense
First I do sex it with him and again I come to cry about it to you 
This is very silly she said

I can‚Äôt give you anything yet I do it with someone else you might be feeling I am trying to get it from both which is absolutely not true 

Physical stuff making things worse for both of us 

May be we can continue when I am free
( I have told her I‚Äôm not going to marry I want to stay single my whole life)

I felt very bad like I lost something 
She said we have become very close so it will take time for us to be normal but we will be strong and will still care for each other like we used to do only the physical stuff we won‚Äôt 

So this my venting you can say

1ghpayz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNOLA/comments/1ghpayz/nola_review/,NOLA review,"Just got back from our NOLA trip and had a blast! The people here are incredible and there's no such thing as a stranger here. 

I thought I'd share some things I experienced/learned to hopefully give some insight to those planning to travel to NOLA from a tourist POV. 

First of all, it's expensive like every other touristy city. $20 for a tshirt, $15 for a cocktail, etc. Budget accordingly. 

Souvenir shops: Not one in particular that I liked, but I will say if you see something you like then keep looking. I promise every shop has the same things and you're almost guaranteed to find it cheaper at a different store. 

Bars: I really liked The Green Drank at MRB and it seems to be a place the locals like to hang out. We pretty much stayed off of Bourbon St but the only time we stopped at a bar there we were charged $9 for a 12 oz can of Bud Light. Do with that information what you will. 

Tours: Can't recommend The Uncensored Wicked History Combo Tour enough. So informative and funny. You can book this tour on Airbnb under the experiences tab. Tickets were $30/person. 

Jackson Square was a really nice place to stop and sit awhile. Awesome views of the St Louis Cathedral. 

The Pharmacy Museum was really cool, especially if you work in healthcare. 

The WWII museum had great exhibits and amazing artifacts. Definitely plan to commit most of your day to this though, the place is huge and it has lots of reading. 

Food:

The Court of Two Sisters: Great service. Gorgeous scenery. Did the jazz brunch buffet and got potato salad, chicken salad, strawberries, pineapple, turtle soup, gumbo, lobster, duck lorange, shrimp pasta, lemon cake, 3 beers and a bottle of champagne. All the food was fantastic. Overall total was $150 with tip. 

Pierre Masperos: Service was okay. Loved the atmosphere. Had a roast beef poboy, jambalaya, a beer and a regular soft drink. The food was okay, not as good as I was hoping but I wouldnt complain about eating here again. Overall total was ~$71 including tip. 

Ruby Slipper: Location in Mid-City. Service was awesome. Had the migos, pork conchon, an iced coffee and a soft drink. Food tasted great and was really filling. Overall total was ~$50 including tip. 

Cafe Du Monde- Location near Jackson Square. Service was okay. Weirdest bathroom situation ever. Had 2 orders of the 3 beignets and 2 coffees. Overall total was ~$15. 

I was worried about the FQ being dirty but it wasn't any worse than what you'd see in any heavily populated urban city. I wouldn't wear open toed shoes but don't think about your footwear too much. Also, majority of people are not dressed up, it's very casual. Wear whatever is comfy to walk around all day in.

Hi all! Not sure to what put here.. So I'll make this up as I go, I guess. I'm 39/F, living in Cali, just looking for some fun folks to DM here or on Discord and kill some time with. Please don't message though if you're gonna do 1-3 words at a time. I'd like an actual conversation.

Best way to get my attention is via a DM. I'm likely not gonna be checking replies/notifications on this post.

Hobbies of mine include:

Video Games - Recently beat Baldur's Gate 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. I just started Dragon Age: The Veilguard the other day. I play tons of genres though. Even toss in a few rounds of CoD from time to time. 

Horror Movies - Horror is life. Especially a lot of the older stuff. Not to say that new stuff can't be good too, though, because it certainly can. Recent obsession is the Terrifier series.

Music - I lean heavily towards rock and metal, but I'll listen to almost anything. Angus McSix is my favorite band, it's power metal. I'm always open to new suggestions.

Also a big (American) football fan, if anyone out there would like to talk about that.

It is common knowledge that people like jelly donuts, so why is it that so many locations don't sell them?  

I dislike it when a donut case has Boston Cream donuts and Vanilla cream donuts.  They are one flavor octave apart.  Have one or the other, then have a jelly donut option!!! It's not rocket science. Always having jelly donuts on the menu seems like a no brainer.

The cookies are an F tier product that just takes up space that could go to storing jelly donuts.  Besides that they are an unethical option to sell to children.  Coffee is for adults and donuts are sweet treats for adults, that is common knowledge.  So selling cookie is an obvious ploy to tap the children's market.

Parents shouldn't buy their kids the cookies either because they are pure diabetes sponsored by M&m's, Recess and Oreo.  Everything that isn't Recess candy that they just sponsors tastes bad (just as a side note).  If you are a grown person, eat a donut.

ONE LAST THING.  This does not apply to Jelly Tim Bits.  I don't believe the average tim hortons employee is payed well enough, or treated well enough to be ethically asked to fill individual tim bits.  That is in my opinion to much to ask from people who aren't being payed well.",4,1730521747.0,TimHortons,3,0.83,False

My (21F) boyfriend (22M) of 8 months and I are doing long distance as we are in our last year of completing university. Recently my boyfriend went to his friends birthday party and he told me about a girl he met. He said she came up to him and the first thing she asked was his relationship status, which he said he told her he was in a relationship. But I‚Äôm like that‚Äôs a bizzare thing to ask someone you‚Äôve just met. Then he said she wouldn‚Äôt stop talking to him for like an hour and he couldn‚Äôt leave because that would be rude, but he didn‚Äôt want to talk to her. But I‚Äôm like no one is forcing you to talk to her, if you truly didn‚Äôt want to talk to her then you could have politely excused yourself. Then she asked for his Instagram which he said he didn‚Äôt have, and he gave her his LinkedIn instead. But again, why are you giving her any form of social media. Then he came home for a week for reading week to spend time with me and I found out after he went back to school that he went out for coffee with her before the break and he didn‚Äôt tell me because he said I always overthink and he didn‚Äôt want me doing that. During the break he told me that she asked him out to coffee and he told her again that he had a girlfriend, but he never told me that he actually agreed to go. I expressed to him that I don‚Äôt like that he lied and that it really hurt me that he withheld that information from me. Like that feels icky. I don‚Äôt care if he hangs out with other women but the fact that he went for coffee with her and didn‚Äôt tell me is essentially like going on a date in my eyes, especially since he always used to tell me where he was going (on his own accord btw, I never asked him to tell me what he was doing all the time). Fast forward to now, a few weeks later, he said he was hanging out with friends but that he‚Äôd spend time with me during the night. He called me and told me that his friend that he went to the birthday party of wants my boyfriend to come with him to see the girl he went for coffee with. I was shocked. He knows she makes me uncomfortable and he‚Äôs going to see her. And to make it worse he didn‚Äôt spend time with me at all that night. I stayed up till midnight waiting by the phone like an idiot while he was out all night. Am I overthinking this and just being jealous or is he truly sacrificing my feelings to please that girl and his friend? ",1,1730521519.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

Also, I like doing things alone and have for years, but, going to a bar or coffee shop and trying to meet someone alone is scary. :/
