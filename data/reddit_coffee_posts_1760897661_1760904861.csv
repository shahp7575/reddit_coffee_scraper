We end up going to Starbucks or other coffee shops every day. We just enjoy a decent black ice coffee, nothing special - just simple black coffee over some ice. But the problem is I drink probably 2-3x cups a day. So it adds up fast money wise, plus the time to go get it etc. We also have some babies in the house and a toddler now, so we've been drinking even more lately. 

  
I was curious on a few things, as I know nothing about coffee other than it's expensive and  I like it strong and black.

I tried the Sio Cold-Infusion Pitcher -  But the time/work wasn't worth it, as we would burn through the pitcher in one day. 

Just checking in to see if anyone drinks black coffee like water and how they solve this solution. Wine barrel?! Keg?! 

\- I have the space for a contraption and all that jazz. I don't want to break the bank, and don't need anything fancy. Just pretty much to feed my habit in the most efficient way possible and stop spending money at Starbucks for something so simple.  Thanks in advance!",1,1760904599.0,coffeestations,1,1.0,False

1oazq0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1oazq0i/deathbird_stories_by_harlan_ellison_partial_review/,Deathbird Stories by Harlan Ellison Partial Review,"I'm reading and reviewing Deathbird Stories by Harlan Ellison. Ellison is one of my favorite writers, and I was able to track down this book to provide a review of each of the stories. Ellison's work warrants an in-depth review. I know he detested his work being sci-fi, but this was the best place to review it (Sorry, Harlan). I won't review every story, as some aren't memorable or not worth discussing.

**Introduction:** Ellison discusses the theme of gods in this book. It's about how the newer gods who rule over humans bestow power upon them, whether consciously or not. This book is quite the downer. He also warns the reader not to read the story in one sitting, as the emotional content is too much to handle.

**The Whimper of Whipped Dogs:** This story is inspired by the real-life murder of Kitty Genovese, who was killed while bystanders witnessed and did nothing. In this fictional story, the narrative follows a woman named Beth, one of the many witnesses to a murder, which is depicted in a visceral, brutal, and unforgiving manner —a style Ellison has consistently employed in the works I've read. While this is happening, the city is in the presence of a death god in the fog that feeds on murder, and there are eyes in the mist.

The next day, Beth meets Ray, a man who also witnessed the murder, and they begin dating, but Ray possesses violent sexual desires and goes on a rant about the true nature of the City. She begins to endure the harshness of the city. Then a man breaks into her apartment to rob her, and then eventually tries to kill her and pushes her on the balcony so everyone can watch, and Beth has to make a choice: Be a victim or a participant.

This is one of Ellison's best stories. This isn't the first time I've read it, but it still holds up. It's visceral and uncompromising. This story tries to rationalize why this murder happened, but the true horror lies in the fact that some people just want to kill others. The real-life murderer wanted to kill a woman. Themes of alienation and violence, as Ellison describes them, are a daimonic necessity for contact. The apathy of the watchers, who succumb to the city's death god, is the story's most horrifying aspect. **Rating 10/10.**

**Along the Scenic Route:** Freeway drivers can soon challenge one another to duels under official supervision. George is out on a drive with his new, upgraded car and wife, Jessica, when he gets cut off by another driver, who then challenges him to a duel.

A story about the Chromed-Plated Killer God: this was a decent read, written in a simple style. What futuristic road rage could look like. A nice break from the previous story. **Rating: 7/10.**

**On the Downhill Side:** This story is about two ghosts, Paul and Lizette, accompanied by Paul's unicorn, who walk the streets of New Orleans, enjoying coffee, visiting the Irish Quarter, the Royal Orleans Hotel, and ultimately ending up at the Saint Louis Cemetery. While they do this, they share stories about their lives, including love, regrets, and the opportunities they have missed. Paul reminds her that soon they will be on the downhill side. At the cemetery, bodies lie in crypts above ground because the water table is only eighteen inches below the surface, and the gods demand a sacrifice.

I enjoyed this story. The characters reflecting on their lives, their regrets, brought the piece to be sentimental, which is rare in the collection (so far). I loved the poetic and atmospheric imagery used to convey the essence of New Orleans. **Rating: 7.5/10.**

**Basilisk:** This follows Vernon Lustig, a soldier imprisoned during the Vietnam War. He was injured by a boobytrap and captured and tortured. During this, he becomes possessed by a creature called a Basilisk and ends up killing his captors. He is rescued by the U.S. but is court-martialed and returns to his hometown in Kansas, where his neighbors, family, and friends must deal with the negative ramifications of his case. He ends up taking revenge against the people of the town.

This was a dark story dealing with the horrors of war and how soldiers return to people who don't or won't understand what happened. Ellison uses imagery to put us into Vernon's Point of View. He's a master at metaphorical imagery. This story features a lot of visceral violence and action. Still, it's the quiet moments with Vernon's ex-girlfriend, Teresa, who is married to an ex-football player, and his sister, Neola, who had to leave town because of what he had done, that make this story hit harder emotionally. **Rating: 9/10.**

**Pretty Maggie Moneyeyes:** This is a story about a lonely gambler named Kostner who ends up in Las Vegas. While gambling at the slot machines, he wins a substantial amount. He keeps winning, only to realize the slot machine is haunted by a woman named Maggie. Maggie is a prostitute seducing men for the money, and ends up at the same slot machine where she dies, and helps Kostner win tons of money.

From the premise, this may seem like a boring story. Still, Ellison's excellent and vivid characterization of Maggie and Kostner, along with the brutal emotions explored in each character, make it a compelling one—another great example of capturing the Vegas setting. The god of gambling addiction was explored in this one. One of Ellison's best stories. **Rating: 10/10.**

**Shattered Like A Glass Goblin:** This follows Veteran Rudy, who comes to L.A. and ends up at a rundown house called The Hill looking for his girlfriend Kristina. There are other drug addicts in the home as well, and Rudy ends up as a manager there. He ends up taking drugs and transforms into a goblin made of glass.

Ellison tackles drug use and how it destroys you and the relationships around you. Kafka has always been an influence on Ellison's work, as seen in stories like ""In Fear of K and Repent, Harlequin,"" and this story is no exception. I would have liked more character development from this before things go off the rails, as the story lacks the intended emotional punch. It's still a good story. **Rating: 7.5/10.**

**Delusion for a Dragon Slayer:** This follows William Glazer Griffin, who is killed by a falling wrecking ball and ends up in an afterlife of his own dreams. He's in a heroic fantasy world where he's a barbarian ship captain, and he embarks on an adventure to fight a dragon and rescue the damsel in distress. Throughout this, we learn of his true nature as a selfish, flawed, and quietly evil individual.

This was another great and interesting story, a meta-commentary on heroes' journeys, showing that stories, and heroic stories in particular, are often based on self-deception and can conceal one's true nature. After Griffin slays the dragon, he rapes the woman and then the dragon is about to devour him, he realizes his true nature. There is a prologue that details four real people who died of cruel chance. I'm not sure how much it contributed to the story, but it shows Ellison knew a great deal. This story was about the God of self-delusion, which we create ourselves. **Rating: 9/10.**

Another coincidence was that this character shares the same name (Griffin) as Griffith from Berserk. My favorite manga of all time features a character named Griffith, who is also a rapist.

1oazolw,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaFe/comments/1oazolw/aclu_canvassers_looking_for_best_spots_in_santa_fe/,ACLU Canvassers looking for best spots in Santa Fe,"Hello Santa Feans!

I recently relocated to Santa Fe and am loving it so far. And hello to any of you I met at No Kings yesterday!

Me and the company I work for are building a small team of canvassers who will be canvassing in various public spaces around the city to raise money for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). 

I wanted to ask locals where they thought the best high foot traffic spots around town would be for street canvassing. We'll likely be out Wednesday-Sunday from around 11a-5p, and since canvassing is a numbers game, the more people that cross your path, the more you can fundraise. 

So far I'm thinking the Farmer's Market, outside of Iconik Coffees, near the Palace of the Governors/Plaza - any more suggestions from folks who know the city well would be greatly appreciated!! Come say hi if you see us out there. 

  
And if by chance you're interested in joining the team, here's a flyer with a QR code to apply.

1oaznkh,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1oaznkh/home_built_roaster_still_trying_to_get_it_right/,"Home built roaster, still trying to get it right! Feedback welcome.","Hey fellow roasters!

I have a fluid bed roaster that I started building almost 10 years ago now and have continually improved on it over the years. Like many, it all started with a pop corn popper on my front porch! I have roasted lots of coffee, but I feel that I haven't quite nailed it yet. The roaster uses two heating elements (from a heat gun and a pop corn popper - stacked), solid state relays, a DC leaf blower, a hacked together roasting chamber, a pressurized box, and sheet metal chamber for the beans. I wrote some software on the raspberry pi that controls the heat and the air, shows live RoR, and saves each roast profile and temps, in case I want to play it back later. 

It's been a good hobby over the years, and I've dropped it and picked it back up many times. Recently, with the advent of LLM’s and coding agents, things have gotten really fun! 

My method right now is to start the blower at 50%, the heater at 90% and preheat for 1 min. Usually the inlet air is about 650, and the bean chamber is at \~400. Then I drop the beans in. Over the roast of about 8-10 min, I slowly decrease the heat while watching the bean mass temperature, and roast to a bit past the first crack. That’s it really! 

All of that aside, I haven't found many good resources for how to roast consistently well with a fluid bed roaster. And my setup isn't perfect, I know. I'm posting this largely because I feel like I've been alone in this hobby for a long time, and many of you are my people, so to speak. Instead of ruminating on this project alone, I’d love to garner some feedback and ideas from the community. Below are a few suggestions, but let’s pretend I know nothing :) 

If you’ve tried this before, where/how did you learn? What’s your method?

From a design standpoint, what are the biggest features of a home-built roaster to focus on? Which ones really move the needle in the journey to roasting great coffee?

Aside from RoR, what other metrics can I measure during the roast to help me “steer” towards a better result?

Unfortunaley she is an alcoholic, a very toxic person and made my life a living hell, not only while growing up but also up to these days.

I went no contact with her a couple of times in the past, but (like an idiot) always ended up giving her ""another chance"".

I'm pregnant at the moment with my second baby. When I had my first  dauther six years ago, nobody throw me a baby shower. I had to planned the event all by myself. A week ago the godmother of my soon to come baby throw me one, and I was super excited!
We decided to celebrate the event at a beautiful vintage coffee house, where they make my favourite pastries (and because in those places there's no serving alcohol).
But my mother had a couple of beers at her home, and she arrived to the event drunk... like mean drunk.

No need to say she made a spectacle of herself: shouting at the waitress, speaking at a very loud volume (shouting aswell, actualy) during conversations, trying picking fights with me, my sister, with my SIL, with my  SIL mother. My 6 yo dauther was there too and she started to scold her for no reason, finding her presence enoying. When my husband came to pick us up, she insulted him too, saying ""I always thought you were useless my boy, but at the end you surprised me"".

She ruined the afternoon entirely.

I decided to go radio silent with her, and she noticed I kind of disappeared of her radar.
When that happens she goes crazy. Starts sending messages, asking ""is everything ok?"", tries to force contact again... this time was no exception. To avoid confronting her I replied to her messages that everything is ok, in a very dry way.

She later organized a special lunch at her house for Mother's Day. I obviously decided not to go and politely refused the invitation, putting as an excuse that I'm to pregnant, that I need rest and want to stay at home.

Mother's day came and I send a general message to the family group wishing a ""happy mother's day"" in general to all the moms in the family. I asked my sister to get a simple present for her and split the cost of it with me, once more to avoid problems. But my mother started the day by calling me non stop. When she couldn't reach me, she called my husband. She made my sister call me. In total: 20 missing calls. Then messages, ""are you ok?"", ""are you angry?"", ""pick up, whats wrong?"", ""is the baby ok?""... trying to pass this as her being worried about the baby.

I wasn't gonna tell her anything, but my phone went nuclear all morning. And she wouldn't stop. Having enough I send her a voice message letting her know how I feel, how she ruined my baby shower, and how angry I am.

She decided to play victim and got the hole family involved.

Now, everybody is calling me an AH for ruining her mother's day.

On one hand I don't feel guilty, because nobody said the same about the fact that she ruined my baby shower. They all say ""you know how mom is, let it go"".

But my sister is saying that I should stay quiet and have the conversation on monday, not on mothers day. So know I feel kind of guilty. So I ask... AITA?",4,1760904358.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

1oazm32,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiReviewInsiderHQ/comments/1oazm32/best_ai_for_social_captions_that_dont_get/,Best AI for Social Captions That Don’t Get Shadowbanned,"Social media in 2025 is like a crowded street market-loud, colorful, and full of voices fighting to be heard. Yet, no matter how great your content is, it risks invisibility if the platform’s algorithm decides you’ve crossed a line. Shadowbanning has become one of the most frustrating realities for creators, brands, and startups. You pour time into creating captions, planning posts, and engaging with your community, but suddenly your reach plummets. It feels like shouting into the void, with no clear reason why. This is where AI caption tools come in: powerful enough to craft engaging content, but also smart enough to avoid the traps that trigger platform penalties. The challenge is knowing which tools to trust and how to use them without looking robotic.

# Understanding Shadowbanning in 2025

Shadowbanning isn’t new, but in 2025, it’s more sophisticated than ever. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and X have invested heavily in AI-driven moderation. They’re no longer just filtering for obvious spam-they’re flagging subtle signals that indicate automation, over-promotion, or community manipulation.

Author Insight:[ Akash Mane](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cute_Surround_5480/) is an author and AI reviewer with over 3+ years of experience analyzing and testing emerging AI tools in real-world workflows. He focuses on evidence-based reviews, clear benchmarks, and practical use cases that help creators and startups make smarter software choices. Beyond writing, he actively shares insights and engages in discussions on[ Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cute_Surround_5480/), where his contributions highlight transparency and community-driven learning in the rapidly evolving AI ecosystem.

**What is shadowbanning and why does it happen?**

Shadowbanning refers to a platform quietly limiting your visibility without notifying you. Unlike a direct ban, you can still post, comment, and share-but fewer people see your content. Algorithms typically flag accounts for suspicious activity such as repetitive posting patterns, spammy links, or overuse of trending keywords. For example, TikTok may shadowban if it detects excessive copy-paste captions across multiple posts, while Instagram might restrict reach if a user’s engagement ratio drops suddenly.

The key point: shadowbanning isn’t random. It’s the algorithm protecting the user experience. Platforms want authentic engagement, not robotic promotion.

**Platforms most likely to shadowban AI-generated captions**

As of mid-2025, Instagram, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter) are the strictest when it comes to caption moderation. Instagram monitors engagement-to-follower ratios closely, flagging captions stuffed with hashtags or irrelevant promotions. TikTok’s AI systems focus on natural language flow; captions that look too stiff or generic get flagged quickly. X, with its fast-moving feed, looks for patterns in phrasing-if captions resemble bot-generated text, they risk being deprioritized.

Facebook and LinkedIn are slightly more forgiving, but they’ve also rolled out stricter filters against low-quality automated content. Public reports on Trustpilot and G2 show many creators suspect shadowbans after using poorly designed caption generators that didn’t account for platform-specific nuances.

**Key signals algorithms use to detect spammy content**

Algorithms rely on clusters of signals rather than single mistakes. These signals include:

* **Repetition:** Posting nearly identical captions across different posts.  
* **Keyword overuse:** Overloading with trending hashtags or buzzwords.  
* **Suspicious links:** Adding too many shortened links or promotional codes.  
* **Engagement mismatch:** High posting frequency with low engagement rates.  
* **Emoji abuse:** Excessive or irrelevant emoji placement.  

Platforms combine these signals with account-level behavior-such as sudden spikes in posting activity-to decide whether to throttle reach. This is why AI tools must go beyond just “writing captions” and actively mimic human variation and context.

**Personal experience:** Back when I managed a client’s Instagram campaign, we tested two caption strategies: one using a raw AI generator and another refined by manual edits. The unedited AI captions triggered a noticeable drop in reach within days, while the lightly edited ones maintained stable performance. That experience taught me the cost of trusting AI blindly in a shadowban-heavy environment.

**Book insight:** In *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism* by Shoshana Zuboff (Chapter 10, p. 322), the author explains how platforms engineer invisible mechanisms of control to protect their interests. Shadowbanning reflects this principle-it’s not about punishing individuals, but about preserving an ecosystem that maximizes engagement and ad revenue.

# Features to Look for in AI Caption Tools

When choosing an AI caption generator in 2025, the biggest trap is assuming all tools are created equal. Many look polished on the surface but fail when tested against real platform rules. The best tools don’t just create text; they actively engineer captions to avoid red flags.

**How natural language generation prevents detection**

High-quality AI caption tools use advanced natural language models that mimic human sentence structure and flow. Instead of churning out stiff, repetitive phrases like “Check this out! Buy now!” they generate conversational captions that fit the tone of the platform. For example, a strong tool will vary sentence length, integrate subtle humor, and use contextual references.

This natural flow makes it harder for moderation systems to detect the text as machine-generated. Developers often train these models on diverse datasets pulled from open communities like GitHub or Hugging Face projects, ensuring they capture real-world language variety instead of sterile outputs.

**Importance of tone variation and semantic diversity**

Tone is a crucial layer of safety. A good AI caption generator allows variation in voice: casual, professional, playful, or storytelling. Semantic diversity also matters-if every caption pushes the same angle or keyword pattern, platforms flag it as inauthentic.

For example, if you’re promoting a café, one caption might highlight the weekend vibe, another could emphasize a seasonal drink, and a third could focus on customer reviews. By rotating tone and theme, AI captions feel more authentic and dodge repetition signals. Tools that offer this feature, such as AI models benchmarked on LMSYS Chatbot Arena, tend to have better reputations on review platforms like G2 and Capterra.

**Built-in compliance filters and safety checks**

The best AI caption generators don’t leave compliance up to the user. They have built-in filters that scan text for spam signals-like hashtag overload, banned keywords, or awkward link placement-before publishing. Some even integrate compliance dashboards that highlight risk levels across platforms.

As of mid-2025, newer startups on Product Hunt are focusing heavily on this compliance-first approach. These tools position themselves not just as “caption creators” but as algorithm-friendly assistants that help creators maintain visibility. According to Crunchbase, many have secured fresh funding rounds specifically to build advanced moderation-aware features.

**Personal experience:** I once used a free AI caption tool that looked sleek but lacked compliance filters. Within a week, the captions it generated for a TikTok campaign got flagged, and our reach tanked. We later switched to a paid tool with built-in safety checks, and the difference was immediate-the captions performed better, and engagement returned to normal levels. That single campaign taught me that sometimes it’s worth paying for compliance features rather than cutting corners with free options.

**Book insight:** In *Deep Work* by Cal Newport (Chapter 2, p. 62), Newport explains how high-quality output requires tools that minimize shallow shortcuts. The same applies here: AI caption tools with strong compliance features protect you from shallow, risky automation and help ensure deeper, lasting results on social platforms.

# Top AI Caption Generators for Instagram, TikTok, and X

Not all platforms treat AI-generated captions the same way, which is why tool selection matters. A caption that works brilliantly on Instagram might fall flat on TikTok or trigger red flags on X. The smartest creators in 2025 are tailoring their AI toolkits platform by platform.

**Best AI tools optimized for Instagram captions**

Instagram thrives on storytelling and aesthetics. Captions that blend visual context with emotional pull perform best. Tools like Jasper AI and [Copy.ai](http://Copy.ai) have consistently been reported on Trustpilot as strong performers for Instagram, especially when combined with manual tweaks. They provide templates that naturally weave in lifestyle tone and call-to-action phrasing without looking promotional.

Another standout is Flick, which pairs caption generation with hashtag research. BuiltWith scans confirm that Flick integrates compliance checks to avoid banned hashtags, something Instagram enforces heavily. This feature helps creators maintain visibility while staying authentic.

**Which AI apps work well for TikTok engagement?**

TikTok requires short, punchy captions that feel native to its high-energy ecosystem. Tools like Hypotenuse AI and Writesonic are popular here, especially since they allow creators to generate caption variations designed for short-form video hooks. According to Product Hunt discussions, users often praise these apps for their ability to produce “scroll-stopping” openers.

What sets them apart is their emphasis on alignment with TikTok’s community-driven humor and trends. Instead of rigid ad-like text, they suggest captions that complement trending audio or encourage quick interaction-like inviting viewers to comment or duet.

**AI software trusted for long-form captions on X (Twitter)**

X has evolved into a space where both bite-sized captions and long-form threads matter. Creators who rely on AI need software capable of striking that balance. Rytr and Anyword are widely discussed on G2 reviews for their strength in long-form captioning. They can expand short ideas into structured posts while keeping tone variation intact.

Long-form caption tools also integrate analytics. For example, Anyword offers predictive performance scoring, giving creators a sense of how a caption might perform before posting. As algorithms on X prioritize engagement velocity, captions that spark comments or reposts are critical.

**Personal experience:** I once managed a campaign for a client launching a digital product across Instagram and X. At first, we used the same captions for both platforms. The Instagram posts did well, but engagement on X dropped sharply. After switching to a caption tool that specialized in thread-style writing, we saw engagement climb back up. That project reminded me that platform-specific optimization isn’t optional-it’s essential.

**Book insight:** In *Made to Stick* by Chip and Dan Heath (Chapter 1, p. 18), the authors explain how ideas gain traction when they’re simple and context-aware. The same applies to AI captions: the best tools craft messages that fit the rhythm and culture of each platform, making them more likely to survive algorithm scrutiny and reach the right audience.

# SEO and Engagement Strategies with AI Captions

An AI caption generator is only as good as the strategy behind it. In 2025, writing captions isn’t just about filling space under your posts-it’s about creating algorithm-friendly text that feels organic to your audience. The most effective creators combine SEO with engagement psychology, ensuring captions are both searchable and scroll-stopping.

**How keyword-rich captions can stay authentic**

Searchability has become increasingly important on platforms like Instagram and TikTok, which now function more like mini search engines. Adding relevant long-tail keywords in captions helps your content show up in searches-think “best coffee spots in Mumbai” instead of just “coffee.”

But the challenge is to blend these keywords naturally. AI tools that use semantic analysis excel here. For example, a caption about a fitness routine might say: *“Tried a 15-minute HIIT workout today-quick, sweaty, and perfect if you’re short on time.”* That way, it includes keywords like “15-minute HIIT workout” without looking forced. Papers With Code benchmarks show that caption models fine-tuned on semantic diversity datasets outperform generic text models in avoiding keyword stuffing.

**Balancing hashtags with natural readability**

Hashtags are still powerful, but overuse is one of the fastest routes to shadowbanning. In 2025, Instagram limits visibility for posts that overload on generic tags like #love or #follow. AI caption tools with built-in hashtag libraries-like Flick-help balance discoverability with readability by recommending niche, less saturated hashtags.

For example, instead of #fitness, the AI might suggest #HIITforBeginners or #HomeWorkoutChallenge. These niche hashtags not only avoid moderation triggers but also connect posts with highly engaged micro-communities. Capterra reviews show that creators using AI for hashtag selection report better reach with fewer tags, proving quality outweighs quantity.

**Using AI to write captions optimized for discoverability**

AI can also optimize captions for platform-specific discoverability. TikTok’s search bar has become a trend incubator-users often type queries like “AI tools for editing” or “best morning routine.” Caption generators that embed these queries as conversational text improve ranking.

On X, discoverability relies more on engagement signals-comments, saves, and reposts. AI tools like Anyword simulate this by testing phrasing variations and predicting which ones are most likely to generate interaction. According to Crunchbase, Anyword recently secured funding to expand predictive analytics features, signaling that performance-based captioning is the future.

**Personal experience:** When I experimented with AI caption tools for my own content, the difference between keyword-aware captions and generic ones was stark. Posts with strategically embedded search terms not only ranked higher in Instagram Explore but also drew comments from people genuinely interested in the topic. That feedback loop proved the value of discoverability-first captions.

**Book insight:** In *Contagious* by Jonah Berger (Chapter 3, p. 93), the author highlights how triggers make content more shareable. AI captions that include the right keywords act as digital triggers, increasing the chances that your post surfaces in both search and social feeds, keeping your content alive longer.

# Avoiding Common Mistakes with AI Captions

AI caption tools are powerful, but misuse can quickly backfire. In 2025, most shadowbans aren’t caused by deliberate rule-breaking-they happen because creators unknowingly make small mistakes that stack up into algorithmic red flags. Recognizing these pitfalls is the difference between steady growth and vanishing visibility.

**Overuse of trending keywords that trigger bans**

Trending keywords can be tempting because they promise reach, but overloading captions with them is a shortcut to throttled visibility. For example, a food blogger might stuff a caption with “#viralrecipe #foodtok #fyp” only for the algorithm to mark it as spammy.

AI caption generators that lack semantic balance often push too many trending terms at once. That’s why high-quality tools now integrate moderation filters, alerting you when a caption risks keyword stuffing. On Trustpilot, users often complain about older tools that ignored this safeguard, leading to unexpected shadowbans.

**Detectable patterns in repetitive AI phrasing**

Another common mistake is failing to vary phrasing across posts. If your captions all sound like they were written by the same formula-“Check this out!” “Don’t miss this!” “Try this now!”-algorithms pick up the pattern. This repetition is one of the easiest ways platforms identify AI content.

Modern caption generators address this by adding semantic diversity. Some even use Hugging Face-trained models designed to shuffle sentence structures and synonyms while preserving meaning. This ensures captions stay fresh and humanlike, reducing the risk of being deprioritized.

**Misuse of emojis and links in captions**

Emojis can boost engagement when used sparingly, but overuse feels spammy. TikTok’s moderation system is particularly sensitive to captions overloaded with random emojis, while Instagram flags suspicious link patterns (such as repeated use of link shorteners).

A practical example: a small business promoting a sale might drop five emojis in a row with a shortened link. That’s a red flag for moderation systems. Smarter AI tools recommend limiting emojis to one or two per sentence and spacing links naturally within context. Product Hunt feedback shows that creators appreciate tools offering emoji and link placement guidance to keep captions safe.

**Personal experience:** I once ran a test campaign where we allowed an AI tool to auto-generate captions without edits. Every post had nearly identical phrasing and an emoji barrage. Within two weeks, our reach collapsed. The second campaign, where we manually refined captions by cutting emojis and reworking keywords, performed far better. That failure was a reminder that AI is a tool, not a replacement for strategy.

**Book insight:** In *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman (Part 1, p. 45), Kahneman describes how the human brain detects patterns instantly, often without conscious effort. Algorithms work the same way-they’re trained to spot patterns. When captions follow predictable AI rhythms, they stand out, not as engaging content, but as automation to be suppressed.

# Human Editing vs Full Automation

AI has made it possible to scale content creation, but relying on it blindly is risky. The safest and most effective strategy in 2025 is blending automation with human editing. Platforms reward content that feels alive, contextual, and personal-qualities that still require a human touch.

**When to manually refine AI captions for safety**

Even the best AI tools occasionally generate captions that feel slightly “off”-too polished, too generic, or too keyword-heavy. Manually refining captions before publishing can remove these red flags. For example, if an AI tool suggests: *“Get your morning started right with this amazing coffee recipe! ☕✨ #coffee #viralrecipe”*, a manual edit could turn it into: *“Started my day with this creamy cold brew-easy recipe below. Who else needs coffee before work?”*

That small shift reduces spam signals while increasing relatability. Many creators on G2 reviews mention that light editing is enough to keep captions from tripping moderation filters.

**How human-AI collaboration improves authenticity**

AI excels at generating drafts, but humans excel at adding context. A caption about a fitness routine might be generated as: *“15-minute HIIT workout-sweat guaranteed!”* A human editor could add authenticity by saying: *“Tried this 15-minute HIIT workout between meetings-sweaty but worth it if you’re short on time.”*

This human-AI collaboration creates captions that sound lived-in rather than formulaic. As of mid-2025, creators who mix AI drafts with personal anecdotes report higher engagement ratios on Instagram and TikTok. It also reduces the risk of captions sounding like generic ad copy.

**Why editing tone can reduce ban risk**

Tone is one of the hardest things for algorithms to evaluate, yet one of the easiest ways to signal authenticity. AI captions sometimes skew overly promotional, which moderation systems associate with spam. Adjusting the tone-adding humor, subtlety, or even vulnerability-can help bypass detection.

For instance, X’s moderation AI is stricter with hard-sell captions like *“Buy now before it’s gone!”* but more lenient with conversational tones like *“I didn’t expect this gadget to become my daily go-to-worth checking out.”* Human edits can turn AI captions into safe, platform-friendly text.

**Personal experience:** I once scheduled a full week of captions directly from an AI tool, no edits. By day four, engagement dropped, and I suspected a shadowban. The following week, I manually tweaked every caption-sometimes just adding a personal detail or shifting the tone-and engagement bounced back. That contrast showed me how small human touches make a big difference in keeping reach steady.

**Book insight:** In *Show Your Work!* by Austin Kleon (Chapter 2, p. 34), Kleon writes about the value of being human in creative output. Sharing even imperfect, personal details connects more than polished perfection. The same principle applies here: editing AI captions adds human fingerprints, which not only resonate better with audiences but also reassure algorithms.

# Data-Driven Proof of AI Caption Performance

In 2025, no creator or brand wants to gamble with reach. Proof matters. That’s why the best AI caption tools are not just judged by flashy features but by measurable results-campaign performance, user reports, and third-party reviews. Data-driven evidence separates hype from reliability.

**Case studies of shadowban-free campaigns**

Several startups openly share campaign results to highlight how their AI caption tools avoid shadowbans. For example, Jasper AI showcased a fashion brand that used its captions for three months straight without a single visibility drop. Their secret was varying tone and integrating subtle keyword optimization tailored to Instagram’s Explore algorithm.

Another case shared on Product Hunt involved a TikTok influencer who paired Writesonic with manual edits. Over 50 videos reached the “For You” page without throttling, proving that AI can work safely when compliance is built in. These examples suggest the real value of AI captions lies in adaptive variation rather than brute-force automation.

**User reports from Trustpilot and G2 on AI caption tools**

Public reviews give unfiltered insights into caption tool performance. On Trustpilot, creators frequently mention losing reach after using free or outdated AI caption apps that ignored moderation signals. In contrast, tools with compliance filters-like Flick and Anyword-tend to receive higher ratings for stability.

G2 reviews also highlight that predictive scoring features help avoid bans. One user review for Anyword noted how its performance metrics flagged risky captions before publishing, saving them from repeated engagement drops. This shows that creators are actively prioritizing safety alongside creativity when evaluating tools.

**Metrics to track: reach, saves, and algorithm visibility**

Measuring caption performance is no longer just about likes. In 2025, platforms weigh engagement depth: saves, shares, and comment quality. Tools that help track these signals give creators a competitive edge.

For instance:

* **Reach** shows whether captions are being distributed widely or throttled.  
* **Saves** indicate lasting value-posts people want to revisit.  
* **Algorithm visibility** can be inferred from sudden changes in impressions, signaling whether captions triggered shadowban thresholds.  

AI caption platforms now integrate analytics dashboards that map these metrics in real time. Combining those insights with manual checks makes it easier to prove whether captions are truly safe.

**Personal experience:** While consulting for a small business, I tracked reach and saves after switching to a compliance-focused AI caption tool. The difference was immediate-reach stabilized, and saves nearly doubled over four weeks. Seeing those numbers on the dashboard gave me the confidence that the captions weren’t triggering moderation penalties.

**Book insight:** In *Measure What Matters* by John Doerr (Chapter 4, p. 107), Doerr explains how setting clear objectives and measurable key results drives meaningful progress. The same applies to AI captions: without data-driven tracking, it’s impossible to know whether a tool is genuinely helping or silently hurting reach.

# Future of AI Captions and Platform Rules

The future of AI-generated captions isn’t just about smarter tools-it’s about how platforms themselves evolve. Social apps are in a constant arms race: creators try new tactics to get visibility, while platforms tighten moderation to keep content authentic. In 2025, AI captions sit right at the center of this tug-of-war, and the rules are shifting quickly.

**How evolving social algorithms will treat AI-generated text**

Algorithms are moving from keyword-based detection toward behavior-driven analysis. Instead of flagging a single suspicious caption, platforms now examine posting habits across weeks. For example, Instagram combines signals from captions, comment replies, and story interactions to decide if an account feels human.

That means future AI caption tools will need to integrate with broader activity patterns-helping users not only write safe captions but also plan varied posting rhythms. According to MIT Technology Review, research into contextual moderation shows that platforms are training models to detect “engagement authenticity,” not just text anomalies.

**Predictions for AI moderation policies in 2026**

Looking ahead, it’s likely that platforms will adopt more transparent moderation policies, at least partially. Public pressure for clarity is rising, especially from creators who rely on content for income. VentureBeat reports that advocacy groups are pushing platforms to provide clearer feedback when posts are restricted.

By 2026, we may see dashboards that explain why a post was limited-too many repetitive hashtags, overly promotional phrasing, or high bot-like activity. AI caption tools that anticipate and align with these new standards will become more valuable.

**Role of compliance-focused AI startups**

A new wave of compliance-first startups is already gaining traction. These companies don’t market themselves as creative AI platforms but as “algorithm-safe companions” for creators. Tools like these often feature real-time moderation checks, platform-specific compliance settings, and integrations with analytics tools.

PitchBook data shows increased funding toward AI moderation and compliance ventures, with investors betting that as platforms get stricter, demand for safety-oriented AI will rise. These startups could reshape the market, positioning themselves as essential partners for anyone creating at scale.

**Personal experience:** When I first started experimenting with AI caption tools, I underestimated how quickly platforms were tightening rules. What worked flawlessly in 2023 triggered restrictions by 2024. By mid-2025, I realized the only tools worth using were the ones investing in compliance innovation. That shift in mindset saved me from constant trial and error.

**Book insight:** In *The Innovator’s Dilemma* by Clayton Christensen (Chapter 5, p. 113), Christensen explains how disruption comes from companies willing to adapt faster to change. In the same way, compliance-focused AI startups are positioned to lead the captioning space-because they’re solving tomorrow’s moderation problems today.



# FAQ

# Do AI-generated captions always get shadowbanned?

No. AI captions are not automatically punished-what matters is how natural they appear and whether they trigger spam signals. Tools with built-in compliance filters, tone variation, and semantic diversity are far less likely to cause visibility issues than outdated generators that produce repetitive or keyword-stuffed text.

# How can I tell if my account is shadowbanned?

Early signs include sudden drops in reach, fewer impressions from non-followers, and a lack of engagement despite consistent posting. On Instagram and TikTok, you can test by searching your hashtags or captions from another account. If your post doesn’t appear where it normally should, you may be shadowbanned.

# Are free AI caption tools safe to use?

Free tools can be useful for drafting, but many lack compliance safeguards. According to user reviews on Trustpilot and Capterra, creators often report shadowbans after relying exclusively on free caption apps. Paid tools are more likely to invest in compliance technology and predictive scoring.

# Should I edit every AI caption before posting?

Yes. Even small edits-adding personal anecdotes, adjusting tone, or trimming hashtags-can make captions feel more authentic. Human refinement lowers the risk of detection and strengthens audience connection.

# What’s the safest way to use hashtags with AI captions?

Limit yourself to niche, relevant hashtags instead of generic trending ones. AI tools that suggest targeted hashtags, like Flick, help maintain visibility without spamming. Using three to five high-quality hashtags often outperforms stuffing captions with twenty.

# Can AI captions help with discoverability?

Absolutely. When used properly, AI can embed long-tail keywords and trending queries into captions that align with how people search content. On TikTok, this improves your chances of showing up in search results. On X, phrasing variations optimized for engagement can boost algorithmic visibility.

# Which metrics should I track to measure caption success?

Focus on reach, saves, shares, and comment depth. Likes alone don’t tell the full story anymore. AI tools that integrate performance dashboards-like Anyword’s predictive scoring-help creators adjust strategies in real time.

# Is it risky to rely only on automation?

Yes. Full automation risks detection and limits authenticity. The most effective strategy is human-AI collaboration: let AI handle the draft and structure, then refine it with human edits to match tone and context.

**Personal experience:** Early on, I tried to scale campaigns using only AI captions with no edits. It seemed efficient, but within weeks, engagement collapsed due to repetitive phrasing and keyword overuse. When I switched to a hybrid strategy-AI drafts plus human editing-performance not only recovered but grew steadily. That balance has stayed my default ever since.

**Book insight:** In *Hooked* by Nir Eyal (Chapter 6, p. 165), Eyal emphasizes the importance of building habits through small, humanized interactions. Social media captions work the same way: consistent, authentic touches-not robotic repetition-are what keep audiences engaged and algorithms supportive.",1,1760904336.0,AiReviewInsiderHQ,0,1.0,False

assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at Miami University

Of course, happiness and joy are an important part of your health. “It’s actually vital for our well-being,” says [Darwin Guevarra](https://miamioh.edu/profiles/cas/darwin-guevarra.html), PhD, lead study author and an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at [Miami University](https://miamioh.edu/). “When people feel joy, they tend to manage stress better, feel more connected to others, and find more meaning in everyday life. It’s one of those emotions that helps us bounce back and thrive, even when things are tough.”

Unfortunately, our brains tend to focus on the negative, says [Aaron Brinen](https://www.vumc.org/psychiatry/person/aaron-brinen-psyd), PsyD, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at [Vanderbilt University Medical Center](https://www.vumc.org/). “Oftentimes, we are really good at remembering all of the bad things that happen in our lives—every bad choice we make, we hold onto for weeks, months, and even years. But the good things float away like balloons,” he notes.

Given how vital happiness and joy are to your health, it’s kind of important to harness that feel-good power when you can, points out [Thea Gallagher](https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1003153511/thea-gallagher), PsyD, a clinical assistant professor at [NYU Langone Health](https://nyulangone.org/) and a cohost of the [*Mind in View*](http://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mind-in-view/id1544156706) podcast. Luckily, some of that is in your control. “The lens through which we see the world is important,” Gallagher says. 

Sure, you can’t really dictate what’s happening with global news or how other people interact with you at any given moment. But a new study suggests that you can make small moves to influence your own levels of joy and maybe even have a positive impact on the happiness of people around you. Here’s the deal. 

# What did the study find?

The study, which was published in the [*Journal of Medical Internet Research*,](https://www.jmir.org/2025/1/e72053) recruited nearly 17,600 people across 169 countries and territories from 2022 to 2024. Participants were asked to follow a web-based weeklong well-being intervention called the Big Joy Project. The project took just five to 10 minutes out of the day, and it had a big impact, as the results show. 

As part of the project, participants were asked to do daily micro-acts, like asking people to share a fun, inspiring, or proud moment, making a [gratitude list](https://www.wellandgood.com/shopping/benefits-gratitude-journaling), or doing something kind for another person. 

After seven days, the researchers discovered that participants reported having higher levels of well-being and positive emotions, along with a stronger belief that their own behavior could support happiness. The participants also reported having lower stress levels and better sleep quality after the project ended.

The researchers also found that there was a clear link between how often people engaged in these acts. Turns out, people who did these microacts more often ended up having bigger gains in their overall happiness levels.

“It might sound simple, but doing something kind for someone else…shifts your attention away from your own stress and helps you feel more connected and purposeful. That’s a powerful combination,” Dr. Guevarra says. 

# 7 habits that can boost happiness

Dr. Guevarra stresses that there’s not “one big fix” when it comes to increasing feelings of happiness. “What really matters is building in small moments that bring you joy,” he says. If you’re uncertain where to start, experts recommend considering the following strategies to support your happiness, and who knows, maybe even help the people you interact with regularly. 

# 1. Write someone a thank you message

Dr. Guevarra explains that telling someone *thank you* is a good place to start. It can be as quick as texting a friend to thank them for listening when you needed someone to talk to the other day, or writing your mom a thank you note out of the blue for always being there. “It can actually give you a big emotional boost,” Dr. Guevarra says. “It shifts your attention away from your own stress and helps you feel more connected and purposeful.”

# 2. Look at the sky

It sounds simple, but when’s the last time you actually did it? Dr. Guevarra suggests “stepping outside for a few minutes of awe” and seeing where it gets you. You might find that the colors really calm you down, or the clouds make funny images that might make you laugh. “Really focus on these micro-acts that are readily available,” Dr. Brinen says. “You can do these all of the time.” And the best part? It doesn't take a whole lot of time either, so you're allowing yourself to feel joy even if your schedule is tight.

# 3. Smile at a stranger

It’s easy to look away or at your phone when someone is passing by you, but Dr. Brinen recommends looking at them and [smiling](https://www.wellandgood.com/health/types-of-smiles) instead. It can be infectious. “We’re pack animals. We have a natural desire to connect with other people and to feel part of a tribe,” he explains. “Connecting with other people, even with just a smile, triggers those parts of us that make us feel like we’re part of a bigger group.”

[Gail Saltz, MD](https://drgailsaltz.com/about/), clinical associate professor of psychiatry at [New York Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine](https://www.nyp.org/locations/newyork-presbyterian-weill-cornell-medical-center), agrees. “Doing things for others increases feelings of purpose, meaning, and social connectedness,” she says. So the next time you're waiting in line at the post office or walking the aisles of a grocery store, a quick glance and smile at the stranger next to you might do you both some good.

# 4. Make a gratitude list

Coming up with things that you're thankful for doesn’t need to be anything major, and you can whip out a list in just a few minutes, Dr. Gallagher points out. “We tend to focus on what didn’t go so well on a given day, but it’s really helpful to focus on what did go well,” she says. “We tend to take those for granted.” If you’re stumped, she recommends thinking about things like your health or even something delicious that you ate today. “It actually helps,” she says. 

# 5. Tell someone you’re grateful for them

Gratitude lists help you think about what you’re grateful for, but you can also pay it forward by telling someone in your life what you appreciate about them. Saying something like, “Hey, I’m really grateful we’re in this together” or “I’m so thankful for your help today” can go a long way, Dr. Gallagher says. Plus, it never hurts to share your appreciation for the people you love.

# 6. Try something new

Drinking a new type of [coffee](https://www.wellandgood.com/food/benefits-of-coffee), walking a different way to work, trying a workout routine you've never done before at the gym—all of these can cause the release of feel-good hormones like dopamine and serotonin in the brain, Dr. Brinen says. It seems random and minor, but it’s actually not, Dr. Gallagher says. “These things don’t have to be major,” she says. 

# 7. Do little acts of kindness

You might think that doing something kind for someone else benefits them, but it also benefits you—the giver. Small acts of kindness are exactly what they sound like: small. These can include quick and easy things like holding the door for someone else, says [Hillary Ammon](https://locator.apa.org/profile/hillary-ammon), PsyD, a clinical psychologist at the [Center for Anxiety & Women’s Emotional Wellness](https://cawewtherapy.com/).

“When working with people in therapy, I discuss the importance of balancing ‘purpose’ and ‘pleasure’ in their lives,” she says. Doing random acts of kindness for others helps to create a sense of purpose and pleasure for you, “ultimately creating a sense of joy,” she points out.

# The bottom line

You don’t need to radically change your life to infuse a little more joy in your day-to-day, and it may take a few tries to find things that work for you. “The key is to experiment,” Dr. Guevarra says. “What works for me might not work for you, so try different things and see what actually lifts you up.” Over time, you'll develop a toolkit of strategies to try that help you feel better in moments where you could just use a little bit more joy.

\*Do note that Google Maps may show a bit longer right now since some connecting roads (Panathur/Ivy Road) are under work, but they’re expected to open by November. For bikes, it’s already smooth. For an accurate description of the distance, try seeing the distance on walk mode.

 A Bit About Me

I’m 26, working as a Consultant at an MNC. Been in Bangalore for about 1.5 years now. Before that, I used to lived in Hyderabad and Gurgaon.

A few things about me:

I like to keep the house clean and organized (not obsessively, but decently )

I’m terrible at cooking, so I’ll be getting a cook — would be great if you’re on board with that

I respect personal space, but I also enjoy friendly conversations, or just chilling on the balcony sometimes

Would love to live with someone who’s looking to make the house feel like a home, not just a temporary setup.

Please text me on WhatsApp at 9205847498 for any further details.

Hey! I made a whole list of everything I’ve found useful to have while grinding in adopt me! Keep in mind this was copy and pasted from a note doc so it might be formatted kinda weird! If you have any suggestions on things to add PLEASE lmk! I’d love to put them in!

inventory items:
* multi-stroller - quad is the best/can fit the most but can be VERY pricey so I recommend double or triple stroller, as usually you wont need space for more than 2/3 spots at a time anyway, especially now that children can carry pets. this one is only useful if you’re doing family method petsitting or grinding on multiple accs at once.
* Marshmallow stand - for infinite free marshmallows! the marshmallows on a stick are the fastest disposable food item to eat, as they only take one use!
* Magic door - allows you to teleport home without resetting your avatar!
* Stands/ice cream truck - lemonade, hot dog, cotton candy, hot cocoa, snow cone, etc. lets you sell food/drink items to other players for amc. recommend setting price to 1 amc. ice cream truck is the same but a vehicle, although it’s expensive and hard to drive so probably wont make you a profit.
* hamster ball vehicle - go le zoom, relatively easy to drive, can hold a pet and yourself, relatively easy to reposition/get out of crashes. also cheap to trade for!
* roller skates - i personally really like the roller skate vehicles for nostalgia reasons, but they’re also much easier to control than big vehicles imo, and they go pretty fast! only problem is you need to UNEQUEP them before entering a building, you cant jump out of them. which i guess makes sense. 
* grappling hook toy of any kind - allows you to be lazy. just aim, click, and wait to arrive at your destination, usually camping lol.

furniture items:
* mannequin(s) - to sell outfits for amc! probably wont get frequent sales but hey its another thing to get amc from! Plus if you like designing avatars, now theres a way to monetize it.
* cash register - allows generous players to donate to you if they like your house!
* coffee furniture item - allows you, and other players, to collect infinite coffee cups that disappear from your inventory when you leave the game. Coffee is the fastest disposable drink in game, at 3 uses to finish the thirst need! 
* lure furniture item - its free stuff. who says no to free stuff?. note you can only get 1 per acc if ur f2p, but you can get a 2nd one with robux.
* piano furniture item - fills the playground ‘bored’ need.
* money tree furniture item - allows you to collect 100 bucks a day, although it caps at 8 and regens slow so you gotta keep checking it till it gives the ‘maximum bucks collected’ notif. takes a while to repay itself but its fun to have
* pet bed(s) - I highly recommend pet beds over the cribs, cus the cribs are real annoying to jump out of lol!
* the 3 cauldron items - allows you to brew infinite big head (for the big head cauldron), hyper speed (for the hyper speed cauldron) and anti gravity for the anti gravity cauldron)  potions! the furniture is real pricy tho…they probably wont make you back any money but hey you have a thousand big head potions now…uh…yeah…maybe this one isn’t all that useful actually.
* toilet furniture - for your pet to…uh…complete tasks, in.
* shower and bath furniture - bath for easier access to the pet and if you don’t wanna go inti the shower zone tm. shower for quicker task completion. MAKE SURE ITS A HOT TUB OR PET BATH! iirc the ‘normal’ baths don’t actually bathe you…i could be wrong tho LOL
* pet food & water bowl - om nom shlorp i sure am eating and drinking
* signs & whiteboards - not inherently useful but you can wrote stuff on them (roblox tags WILL tag profanity and literally anything it gets the chance to so don’t think you can go saying swears now lol), so if you have information about your house or a message for anybody or want to set up signs for what room is what, these will be your friend!
* pizza, donuts & water cooler - pizza/donuts are good to have for when you want food items but don’t wanna leave ur house (relatable). water isn’t that useful as coffee is superior LOL, but if you want variety, or water for rp purposes, or just dont wanna drink coffee in game, water cooler can also fill the thirst need! 
    * Donut frosting & oven - can change the color of your donuts
    * pizza toppings & oven - can change the color of your pizza
* friend builder bench thing - can be a nice way to have your friends help you build, or can just be a way to store amc so you dont splurge spend it all :P
* Jukebox - i don’t remember if this still works, but you used to be ab;e to change the music in your home with this. iirc now you cant add custom songs, but can still select from specific adopt me soundtracks. can keep you from going insane if you play with music on lol
* Added by Fox_OOFCat

Other:
* house big enough to host parties - so you can advertise your grinding house, build, or clothing store or whatever!
* screenshot of the adopt me task schedule - I use this one by Kitten Burrito on the fandom adopt me wiki! it can be useful to get to the task area before its even completed
* timers - either set a 4 hour  on ur phone to collect and re-bait the lure, or to time the days/nights in adopt me if you want. 
* golden apple from hospital - this can cure your / your pets sickness ANYWHERE! no need to go all the way to the hospital more than once per time you join the game!

So I've been recently going through our finances and even though we had some unfortunate accidents the past few months I'm trying to make the best of it. 

I should start off by saying that I make about 54k a year my wife makes about $23 k 

Throughout most of our adult life we have been pretty good in the green however this year has been way too eventful. $300 bee removal, $700 stove replacement, $4,000 hospital bill we're making payments on, and the icing on top is last week I got on an Auto accident and even after insurance pays out the approximate value of my car I still spend $3,500 yesterday and now have $160 a month of car payment when my previous car was paid off. 

I was doing our finances and this is the basic breakdown: we bring in roughly $3,900 a month that's after taxes and after daycare cost (my wife works at a daycare so my son's daycare gets deducted from her pay) we've done the best we could by cutting out things, going buying in bulk with things like store brand coffee and more store branded items 


The only blessing we've gotten in this year was our son being born, though he is the reason for the medical bill. He had a complications at birth and while the bill was originally $12,000 thanks to financial aid we got it down to about 4000

Our average monthly not with everything included such as bills and money spent on my son averages to about 3200. So that's about $700 extra to spend on things like incidentals, the occasional going out, etc

Or total savings we have, again this is tangent on how much they give me for the car so I just about average, roughly about a total of $23,000 in savings. 

Truth be told I'm spending every waking moment of my life the past few weeks worrying about our financial situatio.

We both have stable jobs even though I honestly think she could be making a lot more if she looked elsewhere, and The amount of money we have roughly 20,000 of that is strictly due to me saving and being very diligent with money over the past 15 years.

Maybe someone looking at a different way can have me calm down a bit",11,1760903623.0,personalfinance,15,0.74,False
1oazaoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1oazaoh/i_feel_like_im_isolated_from_everything_and/,I feel like I’m isolated from everything and missing out on life. How to get out of this box?,"24M.

I’ve always been that person who loves to have good friends, loves to hang out with them, but have a really hard time to meet new ones. 

I have severe social anxiety, and avoid every activity that would require any kind of interaction besides “hi”, “a coffee please” or “wanna take turns on the bench press?”, mainly because I just don’t consider myself an interesting person. I’m not funny, I have not achieved anything in my professional life yet, I don’t have a big creative repertoire, don’t read that many books, and the things I like are mostly from other countries (I’m Brazilian). 

I’m also really low profile, barely post anything on social media, but I’m there everyday checking out other people’s lives, hanging out with friends, doing fun stuff, and I’m just at home watching tv and gaming.

Also another thing that might be holding me back, I’m very picky when it comes to making friends. I cannot keep a friendship going if the person doesn’t hold the same or similar values as me and if I don’t feel like its a lifetime one, and every friendship that I have that is like that, the person lives in other city.

And lastly, I consider myself an uncommon individual (maybe just cause I don’t know other people like this), cause I have a pretty good financial stability, but my values are very leftist, which in my introvert view of the world is not a very common thing. I’m absolutely not saying I’m more special because of this or anything like that, just clarifying my situation.

Even being conscious about all these things, I just cannot break through this fear of interacting with new people, and showing who I am. How can get out of this box? I’m sick and tired of feeling alone and of not having plans on weekends.",4,1760903600.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False
1oazamy,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1oazamy/got_a_court_summons_over_a_google_review/,Got a court summons over a Google review,"Woke up to a brown envelope with the town seal and my stomach just folded. Urgent citation from the local court, name spelled weird, still definitely me. I grabbed a hoodie and jogged there with coffee breath, fluorescent lights buzzing, clerk slid me a paper and my hands were sweaty enough to smudge it. It says I’m being sued for slander and insults because of a one star Google review.

Context. My shop is in a shared building and we’ve had water leaking for months, ceiling stains, boxes ruined. We keep calling the community manager, they keep saying the insurance is on it, then nothing. Weeks of mop water and shrugging. I finally left a bad review on Google with a secondary account. Didn’t put my name, but I described my exact situation so, yeah, it’s obviously me. They don’t even know where I live, so they sent the court letter to my workplace like a flex. They want 300 euros, a written apology, and for me to delete it.

I talked to a lawyer. He says they’d have to prove I’m the one behind that account, and also prove what I wrote counts as an actual insult or a lie, not just my experience. He told me not to touch the review for now. My phone shows 12 unread WhatsApps from neighbors and Spotify is stuck paused at 2:13 because my head is buzzing harder than the lights.

Has anyone dealt with this in Spain or EU, over a review? Can they actually force Google to give up my info if the email isn’t tied to my real name?",5,1760903597.0,self,3,0.78,False

(An anime-style, maid story)","*“19th of October, 1885” The blank page was occupied solely by this singular piece of rather untidy handwriting placed at the top right corner. What would follow remained a mystery, even for the hands supposedly recounting events and noting emotions. Not from the lack of meaningful points to elaborate on, but rather the opposite.*

*Having sunk into the realm of her thoughts, Zofia would take her eyes off the notebook resting on her lap and gaze outside, at the rows upon rows of trees making up deep, uncharted forests she was passing by. Her head leaned against the window, feeling vibrations emanating from the train, getting lost in the clutter of its countless wheels. Ah, so many uncertainties, so many doubts. She felt the weight of her family’s issues on her shoulders, even if only partially.*

*“Maybe it’s not going to be that bad?” She thought to herself, glancing for a moment at an old suitcase she placed beside herself. “But when will I get to see them again? In months?” A sigh followed, a futile attempt at dispersing worries. Soon enough her new life would begin, yet what will it bring?*

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

**Greetings, everyone!**

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking for someone to GM this story, I’ll contribute as much as you wish. Be it brainstorming, playing some side characters, you name it. As someone who knows how it is to GM, I wish for you to enjoy the roleplay as well (＾-＾)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*


*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

**About me:**

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Why hello! I shall introduce myself a bit, so that you also know who you’re dealing with. You may call me Frog. I’m a passionate, 18+ roleplayer from CET/GMT +1 timezone. However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don’t be deterred by that even if you’re from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don’t have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that’s worth a mention!

The [X4Y] tag does reflect the gender of my characters, not my own. I prefer not sharing it. I hope you’ll understand <3

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

**About you:**

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

Here you’ll find a few requirements, so that we are sure we match.
- *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I’ve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic ^^* 
- *Be creative! Cheesy, I know, but hey, I don’t want to be the only one coming up with the ideas. This premise has so much potential for unique and intriguing tales, let’s brainstorm them together!*
- *Be excited! Yeah, another cheesy one. Yet, I find it so fun to see an enthusiastic reply!*

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Anyway, that is all from me, I believe. If you are interested, perhaps have some questions, feel free to poke your head in my DMs! Hopefully hear from you soon!",1,1760903513.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone! 😊

I’m looking to connect with like-minded female friends in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. The idea is to hang out, share experiences, and learn from each other—whether it’s picking up new skills, exploring hobbies, or just having fun conversations over coffee or snacks.

I’m open to all kinds of interests, so if you enjoy learning, trying new things, or just want a chill friend to hang out with, feel free to reach out!

Let’s make new memories and grow together. 🌟

1oayzw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Malliem/comments/1oayzw0/violet/,Violet.,"A TV flickered in front of me, hooked up to an ancient VCR playing… Bluey?

Didn't my little cousin used to watch it? 

A modern cartoon fighting to survive on a thirty year old TV was enough to bring me fully back to reality. I straightened in the chair, mentally checking myself over. 

All limbs intact, but bound. 

Something snapped inside me as hysteria set in. My breaths became sharp pants, then wheezes. Stars exploded across my vision, like TV static. I tried to scream, but my lips wouldn’t part. Duct tape. 

I forced myself to focus on breathing deep through my nose, on the flickering TV, on anything but my predicament.

Bluey. 

The TV was struggling, the image fuzzy, modern colors barely bleeding through the old grainy aspect ratio. Leaning forward, I tried to watch it, but the cartoon was on mute. 

Every so often the screen would go black, the TV giving out, before restarting.

But why Bluey?

Movement beside me, and I realized I wasn’t alone. A figure was strapped to a chair, eyes unblinking, watching the screen.

Like swimming against a riptide, recognition came slowly. Painfully.

Popped collar, tie, lanyard. Thick, bloodstained blonde curls fell over vacant, half-lidded eyes that fixed on the TV.

I thought he was dead, until his jaw ticked under his own gag; he was trying to speak. 

His head lolled like a drowsy toddler, flopping forward just as the screen flashed. 

Pale blue light illuminated a coin-sized hole drilled into his skull. I could see pink fluid leaking out of it, streaming down the back of his shirt. My stomach twisted. 

His name caught in my throat, bile choking me as footsteps sounded from behind. 

A figure loomed, and white swirled in the air. 

I blinked. 

Steam?

“Do you want some coffee, *dude*?” The voice sliced through the silence. Dark blonde curls were yanked back. 

“No? But I know *just* how you like it! Two sugars, one cream, and a half pump of caramel! Didn't I get your order right, *buddy*?”

That nasally squawk was unmistakable.

The figure let the boy's head flop forward, and slowly poured the scalding drink over his face. I didn’t see the cup, but my gaze jerked up when I heard the horrifying hiss of steam. He didn't move. 

I screamed, my body jerking, heart in my throat. But my guy didn’t even blink, thick brown coffee grounds meeting blood, culminating and seeping down his temple. 

His body swayed slightly, head inclined, eyes never leaving the TV. 

Movement to my left sent shivers sliding down my spine. Another figure. This time my cry came out raw and wrong, tearing from my scorched throat. 

His restraints hung loose, barely keeping him in the chair. In the flickering light, the ruined shape of his skull glimmered into view, thick red sludge trailing down his neck. 

My body reacted before my brain had time to process, my chest tightening, my thoughts spinning out of control. 

Was that what had happened to me? Throwing myself forward, I felt it, a sharp, tugging sensation at the back of my skull. 

My stomach heaved, vomit searing my raw throat. 

My eyes darted between my companions. I *knew* them. 

I knew who they were, of course I fucking did.

So why couldn’t I say their names? 

Tears pricked my eyes, relief sliding down my cheeks. 

Why did their names sit like rot on my tongue, like alphabet soup, tangled, wrong and shapeless? Names that felt foreign, names that didn’t feel like names at all. 

Why were my thoughts weightless? 

Hollow? 

Numb? 

Like every memory, every splinter of them clinging on to me was being drained. 

I tried to speak, to let their names roll off my tongue, but they jammed in my throat.

The second figure’s head tilted, eyes fixed on the screen. His mouth wasn’t gagged, just stretched into a wide, childlike grin. 

Something glowed behind us.

Three pulsing green lights. 

A computer? I tried to twist around, but part of me didn’t want to know. 

Wires lay tangled at my feet, snaking across the floor. The faint hum of something crawled into the back of my skull. What was it?

“See, Violet?” A voice boomed through the silence as a figure stepped in front of the TV.

The two figures didn’t move, though they did make small noises of protest. 

I thought they were waking up. Hope ignited. 

Stupid hope. 

Naive fucking hope. 

But then I noticed the guy to my left craning his neck, trying to see the TV screen, and the realization hit me. 

The man was blocking Bluey. His face was mostly swallowed by shadow, but that smug grin cut through the darkness. 

He knelt before me, reaching out hesitantly at first, fingers brushing across my cheeks to wipe away my tears. Then he gestured toward the others, lips curling into a knowing smirk. 

“I hate to say I told you so, but I did tell you those two weren’t interested.”

To prove it, he shuffled away from the TV, and the two men stopped jerking against the ropes that pinned them down, their sharp squawks bleeding into muffled moans. Their names. I had to know them. 

I knew splinters. Digging deep down, I tried to hold onto what was being torn away. I knew cooked meals, Mario Kart parties, and drinks clinking together. 

I knew warm, sheepish smiles, thick blonde and mouse-brown hair. I knew panic attacks in the back of a car, soft brown curls between my knees. 

I knew fast-food drive-thrus at 3am. Shameless sex overlooking city lights, laptop screens, bustling cafeterias. Fights. 

Laughter.

Crying. 

Screams. Parties. 

Birthday candles. 

Sex we wanted to label too fast. 

Sex we didn’t want to label at all. 

I knew their warmth, their heavy breaths against my lips. I knew their pain. Their panic. Their fear. Twin smiles dripping with irony and warmth. The three of us against the world with our stupid fucking game.

Sharp, agonizing pain erupted behind my eyes, my body jerking, my nerve endings burning, my wrists straining against the tape. Blood trickled from my nose, slicking my lips.  

And then, momentary clarity: an office, a coffee machine, hands entangled with mine. They were warm, safe. Home.

But clarity tasted like blood. 

Clarity twisted my gut. 

Clarity was too bright, too empty, a cavernous hole growing smaller and smaller. 

“Violet.”

His voice snapped me back to pale light flickering in gleaming eyes. 

His fingers traced the back of my skull. “Pay attention.”

A screech tore from my throat when that warmth, that comfort, that feeling of home was ripped from me. He was taking them away. Laughter collapsed into echoes. 

Voices bled into noise. My head jerked back, leaving only an empty memory, two shadows, and a brittle, ice-cold chill running through me. 

The memories were being violently yanked away, piece by piece, leaving behind two nameless, faceless shells staring back. 

One helpless thought lingered, and I clung on, savoring it. I loved them. That was all I knew. 

I blinked rapidly, fighting the grueling drain pulling them away. It wasn’t until I swallowed my denial that reality hit. 

He was going to take all of them, physically carving their brains from their skulls and mentally cherry-picking them from my mind. 

“See?” he laughed, snapping my focus back to him. He gripped my chin, jerking my face toward his. Leaning close, his breath tickled my skin. I knew who he was. 

I knew his name. That was the worst part. I knew everything about this asshole. 

While they, the ones who mattered, the ones I fucking loved, the ones I couldn’t fucking remember, were bleeding away with every pulsing blink of that green light. 

Every painful jerk of the thing rooted inside my head, hollowing me out. 

“Who would’ve thought they’d be more interested in Bluey than you?” 

His smile widened and he leaned down, pressing a kiss to my lips. 

Even in the dull glow of the TV, I could see red blooming across his cheeks. 

He trembled, unsure where to place his right hand, while his left groped my breast. When he finally pulled back, his smile twisted with sick pleasure. 

Starving eyes raked me up and down, and another memory hit. Painful. Violent. 

Too empty to register, already being purged from my brain. “I guess you didn’t know them as well as you thought you did.” he sighed, took two steps back, and ripped the tape off my mouth with a single swipe.

Bathed in the cartoon’s light, shadows danced across his face; my kidnapper’s eyes darkened and his lips curved. 

He grabbed his own chair, set it in front of me, and sat. “You get one question,” he said, enjoying how I flinched as he shifted his chair closer. His clinical precision and finality in his tone sent me into hysterics. 

I didn't realize I was wailing until he slapped me, cold, hard, stinging. I reeled back; the cry collapsed in my throat. 

He stroked my hair. “It won't be long now, Violet. Almost there.” His fingers traced my lips. “Once the process is complete, I will personally dismember you.” 

He gave a sheepish shrug when my whole body went still. The world tilted, wrong and distant, as if I'd fallen backward. I couldn't scream. 

Couldn't move. 

Couldn't breathe. 

At that moment I didn't know the date or the time. 

I was trapped in this room, in an oblivion where time didn't exist; and I was going to fucking die. His mouth opened, and words slid out. But they were white noise. Shapeless. 

“I know! I don't want to cut you up either, but loose ends and all. I'm going to cut you up, liquefy you, and give you back to the earth.” He grinned.

“Which is fitting, given your name.” His smile twisted. “It's weird.” He came close again, nose to nose with me, breath to breath. I pulled back, and he cupped my cheeks, forcing me to face him. 

“Violets have always been my favorite plant.” The man pulled back, eyes glinting. “I never realized they were so fucking poisonous.”

Breathing was suddenly so hard. Was I breathing? 

My breaths were wrong, shuddery, barely breaths at all. 

“Please.” It was all I could choke out, a helpless, pathetic sob dripping from my mouth. My memories told me I wasn’t like this. I wasn’t a fucking pushover. I didn’t give in this easily. One question, he said.

One answer.

“What are you doing to them?” I chose my question carefully.

That seemed to strike a nerve.

“Why?” His expression twitched. “Do you know who they are?” He straightened, and I drank in the room for the first time. Cold and concrete, like a tomb. *My* tomb.

“No.”

But I wanted to.

I swallowed that bit down.

He shrugged. “I'm not killing them, if that's what you think,” he said. “I'm using them.”

“Using them?” 

“Yeah.” He stepped in front of guy number one. Coffee. 

That was all he was to me: coffee, blood, and brains dripping down his temples. No identity. No recognition beyond a hollow stranger whose name was rotting on my tongue. 

But somewhere deep down, trying to reach him, his memory smelled of coffee. 

Rich roasted coffee beans and fresh cupcakes. 

I watched my kidnapper prod the man’s face. Nothing. 

No spark, no light behind his eyes. “It probably looks a little scary from your point of view, Violet,” he said, voice calm. Patronizing. 

He sighed, loud and exaggerated. 

I tried again. “Those lights,” I said. “What are they?”

His head jerked, almost like he'd been waiting for that question. 

“They're *you*! Rather, they *will* be,” he corrected. “Right now, only two downloads are in progress.”

“What are you talking about?” I whispered. This was madness. 

Insanity.

“Officially?” Twisting around, he shot me a grin. “I could give you a more precise explanation, but it’s way too advanced for a mind of *your* calibre. Let’s stick with a simple playground analogy.” 

He ran his fingers through Coffee’s hair. “I’m sure the process of extracting organic consciousness from a living human source via brainwaves is a little too complicated for you to understand. Think of the brain as a road and neurons are the cars. It can’t function until traffic clears, and right now there’s a fifteen thousand car pile-up.”

He turned to me, adjusting his glasses on the bridge of his nose. “Their bodies are currently unresponsive; a typical trauma response to cranial penetration. 

""Right now, Violet, I’m extracting their neural patterns, mapping their synapses, every thought and every memory. Their cognitive architecture is being replicated, byte by byte, while they…” He snapped his fingers in front of their unblinking eyes. 

“I guess you could say they’re napping.”

I swallowed bile. “They're dead.”

“Oh Violet, don't be brainless.”

He wrenched Coffee’s head back as a sick demonstration. The man’s lips parted, a hollow groan escaping him. “...uhhhh…”

He let go. “I told you,” my kidnapper said, and Coffee’s head fell limp, rolling onto his shoulder, drool pooling at the corner of his mouth. “They never wanted to fuck you.”

“I don't know them.”

“Well, yeah,” his tone darkened. “They brainwashed you to stop liking me, Violet.”

My restraints were two strips of duct tape pinning my hands down. Keeping him talking would distract him. I started working on my left wrist. 

“So, what exactly is the plan here?” I asked, keeping my voice steady, twisting my wrist against the chafing tape. “You do realize that’s pseudoscience, right? There’s no way to copy a living consciousness onto a hard drive,” I gritted out. “It’s science fiction.”

“Maybe,” he said, his back still turned. I timed his movements with my own breaths, waiting for him to fully turn away before pulling my other wrist free and leaping to my feet. 

I tore my ankles loose and bounded forward blindly. But something held me, something wrenched me *back*. 

No! 

My trembling fingers traced the back of my head, where a gaping hole had been carved into my skull. No. I pulled again, but whatever held me was merciless. 

Cruel. It had dug all the way inside me, hollowing me out. My fingertips grazed bone, raw and slick. No. No. No. I couldn’t die like this. I wouldn’t die like this. 

I wrenched forward. This was what had taken them away from me. Another tug sent a wave of electroshocks through me. 

I had to get it out.

A ragged scream ripped from my throat as I plunged my fingers into the hollow where my skull should’ve been, clawing for the foreign thing buried inside. 

My knees buckled. White-hot pain cracked through me. 

The world spun, blinding and wrong, and unreal. I felt myself fall, felt my body hit the floor, felt my head crack against concrete. A face flashed. Just a face. Just a smile. Warm brown eyes. Freckles.

My mouth parted. Agony exploded, contorting my limbs. Memories flared, sharper now, as the cruel edge of the object cut deeper, slicing right through me.

Brighter. Closer. 

The deeper memories. 

The ones he hadn't found yet.

Late-night talks. 

Locked doors. 

Closed curtains.

Lips meeting mine. 

Laughter. 

Distant, but as my mind collapsed, it felt closer. 

Voices. 

*“Do you trust me, Violet?”*

Water. Blue, sparkling water. 

Kicking legs. Splashing.

Faces that were less shadowy, their features beginning to bleed through—

“Violet!”

His voice snapped me out of it.

I was lying in warm red, my eyes flickering, blood spilling from my mouth.

I wanted to go back.

Back to warm water beneath a blistering sun. 

Back to laughter that suddenly felt familiar. 

Back to names on my tongue, exploding, vivid, real.

“Violet, what did you do?!”

I blinked. Reality was cold concrete. Waiting to die. Waiting for my brains to leak out of my ears. He towered over me, expression unreadable. Slowly, he knelt.

“Oh, Violet,” he whispered, his shaking hands slick with wet warmth. He gently patted my head. “Look what you’ve done.”

His voice trembled somewhere deep in my mind as the world tilted. 

I felt him lift my head into his lap, his fingers stroking my hair. The pulsing green light drew closer, glowing brighter until it was all I could see. 

It expanded, shimmering, bleeding into vivid blues and greens.

Like staring at a BIOS screen. 

His fingers worked quickly, feeding something into my skull.

Sharp. Cruel. 

I couldn't move, my limbs were stuck. Paralyzed. 

My mouth opened, but no sound came out. 

“Don’t worry. I’m going to fix you.” His voice collapsed into a wet, shuddering sob. 

“I can make you permanent. So we can be together.” His lips found my ear as I fought for air, my lungs squeezing, my breaths thinning. “I can make it so you live forever, Violet. Isn’t that what you want?”

No.

Instead of clinging to reality, to the ice-cold, to the agony, I reached out, upward, until I was touching warmth. 

Warmth that glowed. 

Warmth that smelled like coffee.

Warmth that—

…

Being a game developer was never something I planned. It just kind of happened.

I was in college studying Game Design, Interactive Narratives, and Game Development.  

I was offered a job at an indie game studio right after college, joining as a writer. On my first day, I expected to stroll in and immediately start writing masterpieces.

I wasn’t prepared for a room full of gawky, just-out-of-college guys with dark circles under their eyes and zero social skills. The office had a hierarchy, just like high school: 

Game devs in the furthest corner ignoring everyone, narrative writers huddled near the coffee machine, and script writers clustered around the table. 

My official job was narrative writing. The other writers were cliquey, already established friends in their early-thirties, with judgmental eyes and Harry Potter stickers plastered on their laptops. 

They lamented over BTS fanfiction and, I was pretty sure, definitely talked shit about me behind my back.

Then there was a middle-aged motherly type of woman, with rainbow pigtails who typed like a psychopath. 

Her idea of humor was tossing a cereal bar in my face and shooing me to my desk. Apparently, I wasn't the only newbie. 

Just when I thought things couldn’t get any more awkward, our team was dragged into a “meeting” that turned out to be an ice-breaker activity. 

We stood in a barely adequate circle and tossed a beanbag to each other while introducing ourselves. 

The thing about having colleagues is, nobody is there to socialize. 

I quickly realized this after learning everyone's names. 

Steffy, Annalise, and Nara were the cliquey thirty year olds on my team.

Tom and Ben were the “popular” devs, already with several mobile games. 

Greta. Fifty four with an adult daughter she mentioned only seventy-five times a day. 

Eli, a programmer. He smiled at me during the ice-breaker, but kept his head down. 

Finally, a dev who introduced himself by sheepishly plucking a ballpoint out of his pocket. 

He didn’t talk to anyone except Eli, and looked uncomfortable when I tried making small talk in the elevator.

So much for making friends.

I spent most of my time at my desk or the coffee machine. Eli came over sometimes to talk, but after catching him with his hand shoved down his pants under his desk, I kept my distance. 

The problem was, Eli didn’t seem to get the hint. He asked me out when we went for coffee, and I said, “I've actually got plans tonight.”

Eli nodded and smiled, and asked me the exact same thing the following morning, running into me as I climbed out of my car. 

I said no. Again. Steffy, one of the girls, noticed him cornering me in the empty office at lunch, and didn’t say a word.

Work became suffocating. Eli was there every morning, two inches from my face, asking me to dinner. 

When I finished my work at the end of the day, he waited until I started to log off. 

Then he would log off, too. “Wow, what a coincidence, Violet!” he said, brushing past me on his way out. Behind us, Nara and Tom were huddled over a project. “I'll walk you to the parking lot!” 

Eli reached for me, his trembling hand trying to wrap around my wrist. 

Tom glanced up, noticed Eli’s grip, then smiled faintly, and looked away. 

Nobody fucking cared.

Or they did, they just didn’t want to care.

Eli started leaving me gifts on my desk: teddies, candy, candles.

When I moved desks, so did he, tripping over himself to carry his stuff to the one next to me. I started leaving early, and then so did he, pretending to be ill.

“Violet,” he’d lean over me while I typed, boiling breath tickling the back of my neck. “Do you want to hang out tonight?”

“I can’t,” I said, my throat on fire. “I have—”

“Tomorrow?” he said, leaning closer. “What about Saturday?”


“I have plans.”

Eli didn’t budge when I tried to sidestep him. Instead, he leaned in, his voice dropping low. “I’ve been around long enough to notice my colleagues’ quirks,” he murmured. 

“Tom bites his thumb when he’s nervous. Nara zones out whenever Greta talks. And Penn… he’s basically an iPad baby if you leave him alone in a room.” Closer.  His breath brushed my ear. 

“I couldn’t help noticing, did you know you clench your fists when you’re lying?”

He lingered, as if enjoying the shiver down my spine, then turned and walked away.

After a while, I realized why Eli’s behavior was being ignored.

“Oh, Eli?” 

Nara nearly choked on her coffee when I mentioned his name. Nara was one of those girls who was like ‘FINE, I'll sit with you’ when her clique was missing. She leaned across the table during lunch, her usual playful expression darkened. 

“His dad owns this place. Don’t ever fuck with Eli.”

Nara laughed, and I tried to swallow the coffee creeping back up my throat.

One year into my job, I was on the verge of quitting. Work had become torture. 

But it was my job. My money. My life. Eli made me feel small, like it was only the two of us in the room, and I was trapped. Paralyzed.

I stopped wearing dresses after he kept brushing past me, pressing against me. 

I stopped tying my hair up when he tugged my ponytail, like it was playful. By the time I was at my year marker, I was mentally exhausted. Always scared. I  couldn't  concentrate on my work. I clocked in, already suffocated by his dancing shadow. 

“Hey, Violet,” Eli said. He pulled out his ID card and clocked in with a swift swipe and a sugary grin. “You look beautiful today.”

I kept my gaze ahead, ignoring him, and pushed through the doors into the studio, making a beeline for the coffee machine. 

Flowers were already arranged in front of my desk in perfect formation. Violets. 

I grabbed a cup, my hands trembling, added coffee, knocking milk everywhere. Shit. 

I reached for a cloth, my face burning, my heart in my throat, my stomach twisting. Tears ran down my cheeks, and I swiped them away. The thought was already choking my mind, sitting on my tongue:

I can't do this. 

I swiped at seeping milk, my throat tight. I can't do this anymore.

“Can you hurry up?”

One of the devs loomed over my shoulder, hands shoved into his pockets. 

The kid who introduced himself with a ballpoint pen. 

Thick brown hair and freckles, his lanyard neatly tucked between his tie and button-down. 

The guy avoided everyone and sat in his own corner. In meetings, he looked like he was dozing off, head bowed and nodding, but clearly mentally somewhere else, probably Jupiter.

Whenever I glanced at him on workdays, he was bent over his computer, chin on his fist, fingers tapping furiously at his mouse, eyes glued to his computer. 

I thought he was working until one day, when I passed him on the way to the copy machine and he let out a guttural cry, slamming his head onto his desk.

He was playing Jump King. 

Presently, the guy was frowning at me like a kicked puppy. “Move.” The developer shooed me aside and set down a cup. 

The coffee maker hummed softly, and my chest ached. I could already sense Eli waiting to pounce, waiting for the perfect moment to run his hands down my back and claim he did it with everyone. 

I stepped back, bracing myself to return to my desk, to Eli, to pretend once again that I loved his gifts. So thoughtful. So sweet. 

*Wow, Eli, these are amazing, but I really can’t hang out.* The words dripped from my tongue like bile.

Maybe I'd fucking hang myself at lunch. 

I wasn’t expecting the dev to whirl around, handing me fresh coffee.

“Here you go!” His smile was warm. “Mocha. Your fave, right?”

I blinked, startled, nearly dropping it. “Thanks.”

He grinned, spun around, and poured himself a cup. “Do you trust me, Violet?”

Something surprising crept up my throat. Laughter. 

Somehow, I was smiling, and for once I wasn't masking or acting to play a role, to fit in, to satisfy ego. I was genuinely smiling. I folded my arms, playing it cool. 

I wasn't used to someone starting a conversation. Unless it was Eli, and I had to rethink every fucking word. “Do I trust a man who gave himself a concussion two days ago from playing a video game?”

His eyebrow quirked, confidence depleting. 

He blushed bright red, and I laughed harder. Laughing, I realized, made it so much easier to breathe. “Wait.” He groaned, head tipping back. “You saw that?” 

“*Everyone* saw that!” 

He stared down at his shoes. “Not my proudest moment.” His gaze flickered to me, lips curling into a smirk. “Do you know how to get rid of pests?”

Before I could answer, he gently took my arm and guided me toward my desk, close enough to feel intimate but not crossing any boundaries. 

The scent of his cologne teased my nose as he leaned in, lips curling into a playful smile. That’s when I saw it, a bluish bruise smack between his eyes. I had to bite my lip to suppress a childish snicker.

“I had a great time last night, Violet,” he said, loud enough for Eli to hear. I knew his game immediately. 

“Same time tonight?” He pulled back, winking like we were in a damn rom-com. 

I thought he was going to kiss me before his lips found my ear instead. The guy was laughing, his body electric against mine, trembling with giggles. “My place.”

Play along, his eyes told me. 

So, I did.

“Sounds good,” I hesitated before pecking him on the cheek. “I'll see you tonight.” 

This guy definitely thought he was the main character. “You betcha.”

And scene.

I didn’t even know his name. I only recognized a few of the devs, and I kept mixing them up. 

Somehow, I found myself a little starstruck. His cologne lingered in the air, phantom breath still tickling the back of my neck. 

He returned to his desk, shoulders shaking with laughter, and I sank into my seat. The violets had been quietly removed. Eli was gone, and suddenly my morning felt brighter.

I thought it was a one-off. The guy was probably just being sympathetic, and my mascara was definitely running down my face at the coffee machine.

But then he slid into the seat across from me at lunch, tray in hand. 

For a small indie company, the place was 
huge, with checkerboard windows, a swimming pool, and a cafeteria the size of a lecture hall. 

They really took care of their staff. 

I was already too aware of Eli watching me struggle to swallow my noodles when the dev joined me, immediately reaching over to snatch my cookie.

“So, about that date,” he said, taking a bite and spraying crumbs everywhere. “I’ve already booked us movie tickets.” The guy reached over to shake my hand. “Name’s Penn, by the way.”

I must have looked horrified, because he burst into giggles and then almost choked, slapping a hand over his mouth. “I’m kidding,” he said between laughs, shooting me a grin. I kicked him under the table. 

“Idiot.” 

He feigned pain, then went back to demolishing his sandwich. The guy was a messy eater.

Penn rested his chin on his fist, warm brown eyes raking me up and down. “Do you always look like a deer caught in headlights, or is that just a today thing?”

I didn’t answer, and he smirked, swiping mayo off his chin. “Oh, shit. Right.” His eyes flicked toward Eli’s looming shadow behind us, his voice dropping into a dramatic hiss. “You’re being stalked.”

“He's driving me insane,” I whispered. 

“Who, Eli?” Penn took another bite, chewing loudly. He finished the sandwich, drained his coffee. “Once again. How do you get rid of pests?” 

“Bug spray?” I lost my appetite, pushing my tray away.

“Pissing them off,” Penn winked. “So, from a completely fictional situationship that’s absolutely, one hundred percent platonic and totally not about fending off a freaky incel.” He waggled his eyebrows, every crease in his face alive with teasing warmth that sent my heart into my throat, my stomach fluttering. “Will you go out with me?”

“You’re kidding.”

He grinned, leaning back, arms folded. “That’s not a no.”

“Will it get him off my back?” I asked.

“Trust me. If he knows you're in a relationship, he'll back off.” 

“And how do you know that?” the words choked in my throat. “I'm the one who has to check my door every night to make sure he's not standing in my fucking kitchen.” 

It was intended as a joke, but my hands were shaking, my voice splintering into a sob. 

Penn’s expression darkened, and for a moment, he dropped the act. 

“I had the displeasure of knowing him,” he said. “Eli is a psychopath. He's obsessed with me. This guy wrote stories about the two of us in high school being childhood friends. I told him to stop, but he didn’t. I tried being polite, and everyone ignored the shit he was doing. Some major fucking gaslighting.” 

He let out a choked laugh, his eyes somewhere else entirely. 

“For a while, I felt like I was losing my fucking mind. I felt trapped. He was always there, in my face, and every time I walked into that studio, it felt like a chain was wrapped around my neck.” 

Penn squeezed his eyes shut, exhaling out a breath. He was surprisingly vulnerable. Small, when I really looked at him. Always on guard. 

Always glancing over his shoulder. “These stories weren’t just a crush,” he continued. “They were an obsession, so I distanced myself. I shouted at him, called him a freak, and cut him loose before he could get closer.” Penn rested his head in his arms. “He’s lonely, and that makes him dangerous.”

“So that’s why you’re always on your own,” I said. “Eli cast you out.”

He lifted his head, his smile lazy, strands of brown feathering his eyes. 

“Was me eating alone and hiding in my corner that obvious? Eli’s dad runs our asses. After I told him to fuck off, I was given an ultimatum: I either sit in the bad corner or lose my job. Since I’m one of the better devs, the higher-ups decided to keep me around.” Penn shot me a look. “On a leash, of course.” 

“So, you're me.”

He raised an eyebrow. “Better looking and devilishly handsome? Yep! Say hello to Eli’s first victim.”

I kicked him again. 

“Yes,” I said, grabbing my bag and jumping up. Penn followed.

“Yes?” He repeated. 

I smiled, and my heart fluttered. “Yes.” 

The good news: Penn Cameron became my fake boyfriend.

The bad news: surprise, surprise, the two of us were paired with Eli for a new project. I braced myself for awkwardness. 

Surprisingly, the initial meeting went well. 
Eli spoke robotically but, to his credit, professionally, keeping his distance. We settled on a concept, and Eli disappeared to his computer to work on designs.

Penn and I played boyfriend and girlfriend convincingly enough. 

We held hands in public, stayed in close contact, his head always on my shoulder, and pretended to kiss when we thought nobody was watching. I found it far funnier than I probably should have.

Penn could not keep a straight face while pecking me on the cheek and whispering in my ear, and I was a terrible actress in general. We ended up acting like two middle schoolers. 

He would drag me into a closet, and we would “have sex”, just sitting there, shoulder to shoulder, cackling, scrolling through TikTok. Somehow, everyone bought it. 

Eli stopped waiting for me to finish work, because Penn never left my side. 

Away from Eli’s cold gaze, Penn and I hung out more freely, and he quickly became something more than a friend, definitely something more than a pretend boyfriend. 

His apartment was full of cats. This guy was a twenty-two-year-old cat lady.

At work, we came up with a concrete idea. Penn already had a name. 

***Neverwood***: a cozy visual novel set around a group of friends in the big city attending an arts school.

Work fell into a comfortable, predictable rhythm for a couple months.

On what was supposed to be a boring Monday, a newbie crashed into the studio.

Blonde bedhead, a wide grin, and a scarf wrapped around his neck despite the stifling June heat. 

His shirt was untucked, tie tangled around a popped collar, definitely an ex-frat boy. 

He looked maybe a year younger than us, and word quickly spread that he was a socialite, the son of a famous food chain family. So, of course he was immediately sidelined and nicknamed “nepo baby.”

I could tell from his rolled eyes when Eli rushed over to greet him that this guy was going to be trouble. He waved and introduced himself.

“Sup. I’m Jude. Short for Jude.”

When silence met him, he grinned wider.

“Why so quiet?” Jude flopped into his designated seat, kicking his legs up on the desk. “Are you all fuckin’ Mormon?”

Jude’s impression… well, it was an impression.

He trudged over to our corner, where we were huddled around Eli’s computer. I was showing off the rough character designs I’d sketched overnight.

“Nice art!” Jude stood over us, teeth caught on a pen he was chewing. “Very *Life is Strange,*” he added, and then plopped down next to Penn. Without missing a beat, he pointed straight at Eli.

“You Eli?” 

Eli nodded. “Uh. Yes.” 

Jude smirked. “Uh yeeess,” he mocked Eli, who instantly looked on the verge of tears. Jude’s gaze shifted to me. 

“I was sent here to work with you guys.” His eyes flicked to Penn, and his expression softened. He nodded to my computer screen. “So, is this the project?” 

Penn and I explained the concept, showed Jude the designs, concept art, and my unfinished script. 

Eli sat silently, glaring down at his lap. During lunch, Jude joined us, slumping into the seat next to Penn. “So, the selective mute,” he said, biting into his sandwich and gesturing toward Eli. “What's his deal?”

Penn choked on his coffee. “Everything. The dude is a freak.” 

Jude’s eyebrows pricked with intrigue. “Oh?”

“Just don't act friendly,” I said. “He’ll get… Clingy.”

My colleague took one look at Penn’s hollow eyes and downed his soda. “I’ll keep that in mind.”

Jude quickly became more than just a colleague. Loud, flirtatious with everyone, and completely unfiltered, he had a brassiness that was impossible to ignore. 

His inability to read a room and his habit of blurting out whatever came to mind made him simultaneously insufferable and the best thing to happen to the studio. Jude called it ADHD.

 I called it being an asshole. 

Seven weeks in, we were closing in on our deadline, and Eli had done zero work. So we made him our coffee boy.

It was fair. I was driving myself insane writing the script, Penn was losing sleep redoing background animation, and Jude was programming. Eli was zero help. Instead, spending days working on his personal project.

We made a rule: whoever was late brought coffee. 

Eli was always late. 

Penn tried to get into Eli's computer to get something we needed (password: violets), but his files were all encrypted. The only one that wasn’t was on the desktop for anyone to see. A red herring, probably.

When we clicked it, the file was empty. But it did have a name.

“Project Synapse.” Jude hovered over me, laughing. “Wait. He's working on another game?”

“Looks like it,” Penn said, glued to the screen.

Three folders:

BUILDING.

TEXTILES.

CHARACTERS.

I felt the breath leave my lungs when three names appeared.

VIOLET.

PENN.

JUDE.

“Wait, what’s that?” I prodded at the screen. “Something about 2021.”

“To you, Love 2021,” Jude mocked in Eli’s voice. “Jeez, this guy is a fucking riot. Why use our names?”

The door flew open and Penn jumped out of Eli’s chair.

Jude didn’t seem to care. He plopped into the seat, spinning around.

“Late again, Eli,” he said.

Penn laughed, and I couldn’t help but join in. Somehow I found myself perched on his lap with his arms wrapped around me. I wasn’t sure when the situationship had turned into a relationship.

“I’ll have a Frappuccino!” Jude announced. “Two pumps of espresso, no foam, and cream. Thank yaaaaa.”

“What?” 

“Coffee.” Jude grinned. “It's your turn, bro.” 

Eli’s eyes were wild as he stumbled to his desk, shoving past me and Penn. “Were you on my computer?” 

“Well, yeah, your password is VIOLETS,” Jude said, rolling his eyes. He stood, closing the distance between them. His grin was wide, a subtle warning not to fuck with him.  Jude’s voice dropped into a low murmur. “If I wanted a fucking character based on me, I would have written it myself.”

With Jude now inches away, nose to nose with him, Eli froze. His eyes darted to me. 

I looked away. 

Eli was a freak. Obsessed. Someone had to hold him accountable, and Jude Carlisle was the only one who ever did. 

Jude’s smile twisted. “Your weird fanfic bullshit ends now. This is the real world, Eli.” He shoved him aside. “Delete me from that crap, or I’ll have your ass arrested for stalking—”

The next few months were tedious. The game was going well, but Eli was acting more and more unhinged.

Eli was there again.

3am. The sound of rain on the window woke me. I sat up, bleary-eyed. 

The storm was comforting, already lulling me back to sleep. █████’s apartment was cold. He insisted it was because “he was prone to the heat,” but I preferred psychopath. Sleep bled into me once more, and I buried my head in pillows.

4am.

I woke to rain being blown through the window, dancing across my flushed cheeks. The air smelled damp. Wet. My eyes flew open. The third time this week. “█████.” I grumbled. “Shut the fucking window.”

""Nope.""

I kicked him, and on my other side, █████ spluttered into silk sheets. ""Why not?""

""Because it's too hot,""  █████ mumbled.

""There's a storm!"" I hissed.

He only grunted, cuddling closer. I shoved him away.

Rolling out of bed, I shuffled to the window, slamming it shut. 

City lights blurred through raindrops; towering skyscrapers the perfect backdrop in a city that never slept. █████’s place dripped “born-with-a-silver-spoon” energy. 

My colleague’s bedroom was full of his accomplishments. Game concepts and character sketches littered the walls.

Pressing my face against the cold window pane, I stared out into the hollow night.

I was tracing a race between two raindrops with my finger when I saw him. Hiding under a hooded sweatshirt, head bowed, arms folded. Eli. 

My heart jumped into my throat. The sidewalk was flooding under his feet. 

He was ankle-deep, shivering, and yet still there. 

Still waiting. I scrambled back just as Eli turned, head tilted, his wide eyes finding mine. And in the glow of passing headlights, his lips broke out into a grin. “Eli.” I managed to choke out, my stomach swimming.

“Hmm?”  █████ mumbled, half asleep.

“Eli!” I cried. “He's outside!""",1,1760902890.0,Malliem,0,1.0,False

I know how that sounds. But hear me out because this went so much worse than I ever imagined.

My husband and I had been married for six years. Things were fine until about eight months ago when I noticed he was texting someone from work a lot. Late at night, early morning, constantly smiling at his phone. When I asked about it, he got defensive. Said I was being paranoid. Said she was just a friend and they were working on a project together.

I didn't believe him. So I started checking his phone when he was in the shower. The texts were flirty but not explicit. Lots of inside jokes, heart emojis, good morning messages. Nothing I could point to and say ""this is cheating"" but enough to make my stomach turn every time I saw his phone light up.

I confronted him three times. Each time he said I was overreacting. He never stopped texting her. He just started hiding his phone better.

So I did something stupid. Really stupid.

My ex had reached out to me about two months ago. We dated in college, ended things on decent terms, hadn't talked in years. He was in town for work and wanted to catch up. I told my husband about it. He barely looked up from his phone and said ""whatever, have fun.""

That response broke something in me. I met my ex for coffee. Then drinks. Then dinner the next week. My husband didn't ask a single question about any of it.

The fourth time we met, I invited my ex back to our house while my husband was on a business trip. We have security cameras in the living room because of a break-in two years ago. I knew they were there. And I knew my husband checks the footage sometimes from his phone.

We slept together on the couch. Right in view of the camera. I thought maybe my husband would see it and finally care. Finally react. Finally feel what I'd been feeling for months.

He didn't check the cameras. A week went by and nothing.

So I did the unthinkable. I downloaded the footage and sent it to our family group chat. His parents, his two siblings, my parents, his aunt who helped plan our wedding. Twenty-three people total.

I added a message that said ""ask him about his coworker before you judge me.""

My phone exploded within minutes.

His mother called me trash. His father said I was disgusting. His sister sent me a paragraph about how I destroyed their family's reputation. My own mother called crying, asking what was wrong with me.

But my husband? Nothing. Radio silence for six hours.

Then he came home. Didn't yell, didn't cry, didn't even look angry. He just walked past me into our bedroom and started packing.

""We need to talk about this,"" I said.

""No we don't.""

""You were emotionally cheating first. For months. You ignored me.""

He stopped packing and finally looked at me. His face was blank. ""You sent a video of yourself sleeping with someone else to my entire family. To your parents. To people we see at holidays.""

""Because you wouldn't listen.""

""I was texting a coworker. We never touched. We never kissed. We never did anything physical. And yeah, maybe it was inappropriate. Maybe I was being an idiot. But you didn't just cheat. You performed it. You made sure everyone we know would see it.""

He finished packing and left. Stayed at his brother's place.

I thought he'd cool down and we'd talk. That was three weeks ago. He filed for divorce yesterday. His family has blocked me on everything. My own parents aren't speaking to me. My friends have taken sides and most of them aren't on mine.

His coworker? She sent him a message after everything happened saying she had no idea I was so upset and she'd keep things strictly professional. Turns out they really were just friends working on a project. He showed me the full text history during the one conversation we had with lawyers present. Nothing sexual. Nothing romantic. Just work stuff and some friendly banter.

I destroyed my marriage over texts that meant nothing. And instead of proving a point, I just proved I was exactly what his mother called me.

The security footage is out there forever. His family saved it. Probably sent it to other people. My parents can't look at me. And my husband, the man I thought I'd spend my life with, won't even answer my calls anymore.

Was trying to make him jealous really worth becoming the villain in everyone's story?

1oayxpp,https://i.redd.it/jgnlyiqxf4wf1.jpeg,"After 3 blind tests, I still can’t tell the difference between ZP6 and K-Ultra","I own both grinders (ZP6 and K-Ultra), and both can make great pour-overs and more. But after three blind tests, I can’t reliably tell the difference between them in the cup.

Maybe if seasoning is a real thing, the differences will show up eventually, as my K is two years old and my ZP only a week or so but for now, the only noticeable distinctions are in user experience:
	•	The sound and feel of grinding and clicking
	•	Magnetic vs. screw-on catch cup
	•	ZP6 being some easier to grind with (though maybe a bit slower too)

Drawdown is also a bit faster with the ZP6 and the bed a bit cleaner, but even though it’s around 15-20 seconds quicker, I still can’t taste a difference. And this is not because I can’t taste the differences between coffees normally. I would say I can. 
I taste the differences when it comes to origin, processing, roast levels, grind sizes, recipes and brewers, temperature, papers, water hardness etc. 
I constantly make notes and keep evolving recipes but for these two I can’t taste the difference when blind. I tell myself I can when knowing which is what.

I’ve been pretty dedicated to coffee for a few years now, and this surprised me a bit. 

Anyone else had a similar diminishing returns-experience with high-end hand grinders?

I'll do a separate restaurant review post in another sub I'll link below, but will put our overall list here. **Any questions or more detail on any part required, please ask!**

**Firstly** \- my partner and I spent a fair chunk of money on this trip. It was our honeymoon we've been saving for four years for, married last year to give us more time to save - and we aren't sure if we'll be able to go on such big holidays for a while again after (money & potential future family). So some of this will likely seem extravagant, although I booked a lot of this many months in advance to try to reduce price where possible.

**Secondly** \- despite a lot of reading warning about the potential of crime etc, we experienced no safety issues on our trip, and didn't feel any worse than parts of London/ Glasgow we grew up in. But we didn't go into the townships or anything, and took precautions that we advertised on here - basically, took an Uber almost everywhere when dark (with the exception of Stellenbosch).

**Summary** \- Stellenbosch (3N), Hermanus (2N), Camps Bay (3 Nights), Cape Town (3N), Sabi Sands (4N), J'burg (1N), Rwanda, Kigali (1N), Volcanos National Park (2N), Kigali (1N).

**Advice (SA Specific)**:

1. Uber everywhere, it's so cheap (compared to the UK/ EU anyway). But found that the timing on the app was a bit off (e.g. 5 mins ETA was actually more often closer to 10 minutes). No big deal, just something we consistently found.
2. We took too much cash out, but so many places are card friendly (including tips) that we really didn't need that much.
3. We spent a lot of time in EU (working) in last few years, and are accustomed to later dinners (8pm onwards) - however, would honestly have changed many of our bookings and gone 7pm, as so many places seemed absolutely dead by the time we got there, or were being served our main courses. A few places we also felt hurried to leave, with two courses served at once for instance.

From the UK, white, heterosexual couple, both 30 years old.

**Day 1**  
Arrived 11am to CPT. Hired a car (Avis) and drove to Stellenbosch. Checked into hotel ([River Manor Boutique Hotel](https://thelivingjourneycollection.co.za/river-manor/)). Walked around the town for the afternoon - people in all the stores we stoped in were all so friendly, and had a lovely time walking round the university buildings and Jan Marais Nature Reserve, then by the athletics stadium etc.

We went to [Republique Café](https://www.instagram.com/republique_stellies/?hl=en) (also opposite a lovely book store) for coffee and toasties. Then to [The Fat Butcher](https://www.google.com/search?q=Fat+Butcher+stellenbosch&client=safari&sca_esv=9ad86cb79b02c9a4&rls=en&sxsrf=AE3TifPDbf08VjqW8qnbMvsWg6GLCTStGQ%3A1760890090267&ei=6gz1aNv1D7nqhbIP9_z_gAs&ved=0ahUKEwjbksbi0rCQAxU5dUEAHXf-H7AQ4dUDCBE&uact=5&oq=Fat+Butcher+stellenbosch&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiGEZhdCBCdXRjaGVyIHN0ZWxsZW5ib3NjaDIKECMYgAQYJxiKBTIKECMYgAQYJxiKBTIREC4YgAQYsQMYgwEYxwEYrwEyChAAGIAEGBQYhwIyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgoQABiABBgUGIcCMgUQABiABEijE1B3WMUQcAF4AZABAJgBZqAB_AeqAQQxMi4xuAEDyAEA-AEBmAIOoAL3CMICBxAjGLADGCfCAgoQABiwAxjWBBhHwgINEAAYgAQYsAMYQxiKBcICDhAAGLADGOQCGNYE2AEBwgIZEC4YgAQYsAMYQxjHARjIAxiKBRivAdgBAcICFhAuGIAEGLEDGEMYgwEYxwEYigUYrwHCAgsQLhiABBjHARivAZgDAIgGAZAGE7oGBggBEAEYCZIHBDEyLjKgB_OeAbIHBDExLjK4B-YIwgcGMi0xMS4zyAdo&sclient=gws-wiz-serp) for late dinner.

**Day 2**  
Relatively late morning (tired from the flight). Went to Babylonstoren for the day/ afternoon, with [Babel](https://babylonstoren.com/babel) booked for lunch. Could easily kill an afternoon here: lunch, walking around, had an ice cream from their store, wee museum on wine. Loads of road works to took a while to get there/ back. Went to Rust en Vrede for dinner (amazing).

**Day 3**  
Decided against the wine tram, as wanted to visit specific vineyards and was just easier to Uber to them. Went to Jordan Vineyards for a Jeep Tour/ tasting, then a picnic. Then went to Delaire Graff for more wine tasting (the scenic tasting area is closed at the moment mind), then walked/ golf carted across to Tokara for more wine tasting, and then dinner in the evening. All vineyards were great for different reasons.

**Day 4**  
Drove to Franschhoek, nice wee walk around. Then went to [Epice](https://www.lacolombe.restaurant/epice) for lunch (incredible) whales from our room). Then a leisurely drive to Hermannus, staying at [Mosselberg On Grotto](https://www.mosselberg.co.za) (the Southern Right room was one of the best of our whole trip and saw several whales breaching from it). Did the cliff walk into town, dinner at the Wine Glass (no booking) and then Uber back. Amazing lightning storm that night that we watched.

**Day 5**  
Went to Fernkloof Nature Reserve and walked up to the Three Dams. Went to visit each one. In theory I read you could swim in them, but the water looked really discoloured and not really appealing to be honest. Wasn't that long a hike, bit more vegetation around the third dam to fight through. Went to Hermannus centre in the afternoon (You Scream Ice Cream, lemon meringue, hot damn that was good). Then to Creation Wines in the afternoon (service was poor and wine was average, not our favourite. Also hard to get an Uber home from).

**Day 6**  
Drove the R44 (Clarens Drive). Stopped at at Betty’s Bay (saw the penguins for free) and Dappat Se Gat (spent a while wandering and climbing some rocks - was only us on the beach, was so good). Unfortunately not great weather of the trip, so had planned to go to the Harold Porter Botanical Gardens and IDIOM Wine Farm (for views) but didn't bother in the end. The beach on Kogelbaai was closed.

Scenery from the drive was unreal the whole way round. Stopped for a few viewpoints. Then went to Peregrine Pie Stand for chicken pie (lovely wee stop), and then Pajamas + Jam for cake (super weird location in an industrial area, but really pretty inside, great cake and looked liked good lunch menu too). Then went to Camps Bay, staying at [Funkey Villas](https://www.funkeyvillas.com). Did an evening Crossfit Class at Motley Crew. Went out to dinner for [Pot Luck Club](https://thepotluckclub.co.za/home/) for dinner - Thai Green Martini aside, thought it was massively overrated and expensive for what it was.

**Day 7**  
Drove to [Tintswalo Atlantic](https://www.tintswalo.com/atlantic) for their earliest lunch booking (amazing scenery from your table). Then drove Chapmans Peak and down to Cape of Good Hope via Noordhoek Beach, then back via Simonstown and then the M3. Didn't bother stopping at Boulders Beach (hence going to Betty's Bay previously). We walked up to the lighthouse (you'll get annoyed by slow/ unfit walkers) and around about it, but there looked to be loads of other lovely walks on the Cape that we didn't have time for. If we repeated the trip we'd spend lots more time here - it wasn't well reviewed on other places, but just looked lovely scenery and loads of great walking locations. Then went to the [Codfather](https://www.codfather.co.za) for dinner, which was great sushi and awesome concept (choosing your fish to eat).

**Day 8**  
Morning Crossfit session at Motley Crew, then went walking around Camps Bay for coffee and exploring the beaches. Went to lunch at [Belly of the Beast](https://bellyofthebeast.co.za) \- which was awesome food, people and value. Then hop on, hop off bus tour around the city, and explored the V&A Waterfront - we thought this was extremely overrated - just a fancy shopping mall really, everything expensive and similar to London really. Bus tour was ok, been on better, but nice to get an overview of the city. Then went to [FYN](https://www.fynrestaurant.com) for dinner.

**Day 9**  
Transferred to our other hotel in Cape Town outside Camps Bay ([Camissa House](https://www.camissahouse.com)). Then got an Uber to Lions Head and hiked up it (great views, and fairly easy/ short climb, about 2hrs round trip, with lots of chilling at the top for photos). Loads of people on the path, and security at the bottom, felt very safe. Minor scrambling. Back to hotel to check in, then to Table Mountain to climb the India Venster via Kloofs Corner. Saw no one on the path at all, and parts of this were tough (quad burn). Fun scrambling and have to be careful to follow the path (can get hard to follow at times). But really enjoyed the route versus the stepathon other routes. Took us about 3hrs, several stops for photos (and breathing). Chilled and got a drink at the top, then cable car down - didn't stay for sunset due to cable car timings and queues at the top (some people up there, ugh). [TTK Fledglings](https://ttkfledgelings.co.za) for dinner.

**Day 10**  
Went to Beau Constantia vineyard - distinctly average wine and service, though views were relatively nice. Went to Old Biscuit Mill market and Oranjezicht City Farm Market which both were nice to wander around and get food from, although have seen better/ more diverse markets in SE Asia generally. Dinner at [La Colombe](https://www.lacolombe.restaurant/la-colombe) \- unreal. 

**Day 11**  
Did the Apartheid to Freedom free walking tour in the morning. Went to [Salsify at the Roundhouse](https://salsify.co.za/home/) for lunch. Then chilled at hotel for the rest of the evening.

**Day 12 - 15**  
Transfer to Sabi Sands, Silvan Safari. Incredible and one of our best experiences ever. Multiple reasons why I chose this lodge over others, and felt vindicated for doing so when we there.

**Day 16**  
Morning game drive and then afternoon transfer to J'burg. 03:00 flight to Kigali. Staying at the [Retreat by Heaven](https://www.hemingways-collection.com/retreat-kigali/) (overrated and expensive).

**Day 17**  
Explored Kigali. Went to the genocide museum (horrifying but super interesting) and some markets - wouldn't really recommend, hassled (not in a bad way) quite a lot.

**Day 15**  
Transfer to [Virunga Lodge](https://volcanoessafaris.com/lodge/virunga-lodge-rwanda/) in Volcanos National Park. Went to Diane Fossey museum as a stop, enjoyed the evening sights in the park.

**Day 16**  
Trekking with mountain gorillas. So good. But please have a realistic gauge of your fitness levels, few issues with USA girls in our group over-estimating their fitness levels and really stalling everyone with unnecessary panic attacks on the mountain. And please make sure to bring enough cash to trip porters, ranges, guides and drivers (some people didn't...). And wear appropriate clothing, at the start of the day at the muster point saw some 'interesting' outfits (vans, shorts and t-shirts). Lots of nettles, can get cold, can get hot, you'll need water, etc.

**Day 17**  
Transfer to Kigali. Pouring rain, and we chilled in the hotel in the afternoon.

**Day 18**  
Wandered round Kigali, in a few parks and nature reserves (one with injured cranes). Then late flight home.

1oaytne,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1oaytne/whats_your_favourite_type_of_natural_science/,What's your favourite type of (natural) science?,"For me, it's chemistry. It's the perfect amount of math and memorization and it's very applicable in everyday life. Organic chemistry is okay but stoichiometry is what I like the most.

Biology is interesting because it has so many applications in all sorts of fields like medicine and ecology.  The downside of studying it is the sheer amount of memorization required.

Physics is alright but I only like classical physics. The math is okay but I've never really enjoyed deriving formulas. For me, a good chunk of quantum physics and astronomy feels way too academic and has a lot less commercial applications (e.g. quarks, black holes, etc.)

I used to dislike climate science and meteorology but I find it way more interesting now than astronomy. It's interesting how different weather patterns can affect things like fishing and coffee production.

I'm not much of a geology fan but I do like geography a lot more since it covers way more aspects like physical geography (of which geology is a part of) and human geography (though that's not exactly a natural science).

I guess I really like applied science, not academic science. What about you guys? ",5,1760902483.0,CasualConversation,8,1.0,False
1oayt22,https://v.redd.it/69mggs50f4wf1,Sam & Max & Talking Sasquach Hacking Billboards!,"A inspired by a1993 adventure game featuring a cartoon dog and rabbit sidekick detectives, recreated in its classic pixel-art and hand-painted cartoon style. The camera shows Talking Sasquach — a tall, computer-hacking Sasquatch wearing sunglasses — standing between Character A (the anthropomorphic dog detective in a suit and fedora) and Character B (the chaotic white rabbit). The setting is a quirky roadside attraction with bright colors, exaggerated cartoon perspective, and strange signs in the background. Talking Sasquach is holding a laptop with glowing green Matrix code on the screen, joking with character A and character B about hacking the highway billboards. The dialogue feels absurd and witty, like classic humor. The animation mimics 1990s point-and-click adventure cutscenes: limited but expressive movement, hand-drawn backgrounds, pixelated character shading, and exaggerated comic timing. Add small touches like Character A sipping coffee, Character B bouncing impatiently, and a cursor briefly flickering in the corner. The overall mood is playful, surreal, and nostalgic — like a lost cutscene from the game featuring Talking Sasquach as a new side character. Length: 10 seconds Aspect Ratio: 16:9 Style: 1990s adventure game pixel-art animation Lighting: Bright, cartoony, exaggerated shading Mood: Witty, absurd, nostalgic. Landscape orientation

My parents marriage over the years was a little shaky I had seen fighting , quitting the whole sh-bang since a small age but about 8 years ago my father got fed up because this was not the family he desired and just was frustrated with his life, so he just left , to stay 2 kms away in my buas house, one of my bua is widowed and the other unmarried and they are completely religion centric and I mean it in a pretty extreme case. Now my father left and has been living there since 8 years. Meanwhile the condition of this house has deteriorated, he does send my mother money after her asking for it again and again over the month and yes I do get my college travel expenses too. He has his own start up in tech field he started 6 years ago and has a good decent network but has invested a lot in the company with a little cash flow problems here and there. So he tells me he does not have money for most of the things I, mom or the house required. And when I mean the house has deteriorated I mean it , the kitchen slab is full of termite woods the slab is bent 5 inches , my rooms bathroom does not have a door had to be taken out because of again termite, the doors don't have handles, my mom doesn't have a cooler or an ac since 4 years. But I'm still not on the worst part I wouldn't take your time for all this.

So I have an elder sister too she's 27 and she was the golden child so as soon as dad settled her for her college in bengaluru He moved out of the house. So my sister and this being only my point of view probably was the ultimate child for my parents. They moved abroad during her early years for 4 years us, china, germany , singapore, canada everywhere dismelands and shit back in 2000 tho. So now my sister was raised like every other child in out country, and parents literally everywhere have to strict them time to time with obviously nothing that would harm the child but parents tend to raise their children to be disciplined, and as was my sister life she was top ranker in initial years , was not let talk to a lot of boys, timings were a lil strict, and academics was told important, and both my parents are educated , like very educated, so it was nothing like bad treatment it was just parental scolding and punishments a slap when we fuck up that's how kids are taught. Now my sister came back from college and in college as she was in a hostel she got into drinking smoking , and I mean yeah engineering colleges I get it being in one myself but well she was such a protected child she had little to no touch with reality.

Now she even made a bf and told mom about him , eventually the guy slapped her at the end of the relationship in banglore after 6 months. She came back was into smoking heavily. And yes she was erratic og god was she erratic I mean she had always been a very tempromental and abusive person, I mean being her little brother I know the difference between brother sister hitting and domestic abuse and I still till date have scars on my arms of her fingernails, scars from glass in my hand because she threw plates at me. But this was after coming back from college in her years before college in 11th 12th she still fought abused my mom and dad , ""saale"" ""ullu ke patthe"" I mean not abusives but still to your father?. So the absence of a fther figure in this house has let her go loose.

Now v importantly I'd like to mention my mother is dystrophy muscle weakness patient meaning her brain doesn't send signals very well to her muscles she can walk just very slowly and she can't stand and bend her knees so it is already a massive massive struggle for her to anything at all but she was a teacher when she could walk a little, she is a sweet lady she teaches small children a good person a very good mother, never let us sleep hungry.

Now my sister was encouraged by my mother to work after college she was reluctant at first. She got a job in some good companies but she quit in a few months everytime saying she had issues at the workplace. So she started to earn a lil money from doing a job then used to sit at home and burn through that money. It must sound okay but to put in perspective she has been back 6 years and she has worked 8 months, rest entire time she sat at home broke, without any work , aim hobby anything and she started fighting a lot in the house with my mother, she started getting violent screeming aggressively, threatening, and she was fighting using things from her apparent victim past, I'd like to list some for you , one of the being that my oarents got her to have a boycot at the age of 6 through 9 yes 6 though 9 and they made her embarrassed, that my mom used to slap her when she used to abuse, when my dad scolded her for not attenting her caoching classes . These things must sound very normal I think because yes they are normal but she uses these menial things like a mental patient with bad and horrible abuses for hours and hours ( I have like footage for about 2 hours of her screamimg)about her apparent victim past in which she gets angry because my parents raised her literally like everyone raised their children.

Still not the most extreme thing recently in the last 2 3 years she has gotten really really violent and as she had literally no work all she did was take the frustration of her self failed life on my mother and me. She started hitting my mother in fights, slaps ,punches everything, let me remind you my mother can't even get up from a sofa without holding to something , a woman who couldn't withstand a light crowded push she started getting hit by my sister, and when I came in between I got the scars mentioned above. She has spilled hot coffee on my mother and hit her and when asked she said bachpan m tumne mujhe maara tha ab m tumhe maarungi. My mother has not stepped outside the house in 6 years, she has to hide every valuable item in the house in her room scared of my sister selling them for money for cigarettes, she used to spill oil so that my mother slips and falls. Now in these extreme cases my mother had to call the police on her but they all said the same thing that if my mother doesn't own this house she can't make my sister leave. She saw this loophole and got more violent screamimg fighting 20 hours a day. It is really really horrible ,I mean I witness it so much . Now my father obviously hating my mother's guts because she spoiled his kids, she didn't let him live with his mother, she wasn't a good wife whatever whatever didn't mind her being troubled. Saying ki tumhari ma ne jese apni beti badi kri , uska fal milra usse. But well I am also my mother's son and I have been self sufficient since 19. 

Anyway multiple times police has come in the last 2 years , my mother struggling absolutely struggling to find peace in this house. I mean there are no utensils in the house there are 3 spoons 2 plates, if I am hungry there is literally nothing in my fridge at night that could be eaten.

Now comes the legal part so my mother and father have signed for divorce 3 months ago but my mother not having a lot of money could only hire a 10 k lawyer and honestly I saw him he was bad he was so bad he just sat there didn't say anything at all meanwhile my father came with his fleet of lawyers. The main motivation I have for my mother to divorce is that's she becomes the owner of this house and can ask my sister to leave so that atleast she can live her old age in peace. But the lawyer well is saying we need to wait and wait it's been 6 months . I asked my father last month what's the holdup he said your mother's lawyer is not responsible. Till today right as I'm writing this post the fighting is going on. It's been 8 years it's been like a prison, it is like living with a person who has all the energy in the world to just fight and fight. I am writing her as a last resort if anyone has any advice anything at all any help, I mean I still can take it well I'm young but it breaks my heart seeing my mother like this everyday I  appreciate all the people who read till the last. Thank you so much.

So he tells me he does not have money for most of the things I, mom or the house required. And when I mean the house has deteriorated I mean it , the kitchen slab is full of termite woods the slab is bent 5 inches , my rooms bathroom does not have a door had to be taken out because of again termite, the doors don't have handles, my mom doesn't have a cooler or an ac since 4 years. But I'm still not on the worst part I wouldn't take your time for all this.

So I have an elder sister too she's 27 and she was the golden child so as soon as dad settled her for her college in bengaluru He moved out of the house. So my sister and this being only my point of view probably was the ultimate child for my parents. They moved abroad during her early years for 4 years us, china, germany , singapore, canada everywhere dismelands and shit back in 2000 tho. So now my sister was raised like every other child in out country, and parents literally everywhere have to strict them time to time with obviously nothing that would harm the child but parents tend to raise their children to be disciplined, and as was my sister life she was top ranker in initial years , was not let talk to a lot of boys, timings were a lil strict, and academics was told important, and both my parents are educated , like very educated, so it was nothing like bad treatment it was just parental scolding and punishments a slap when we fuck up that's how kids are taught. Now my sister came back from college and in college as she was in a hostel she got into drinking smoking , and I mean yeah engineering colleges I get it being in one myself but well she was such a protected child she had little to no touch with reality.

Now she even made a bf and told mom about him , eventually the guy slapped her at the end of the relationship in banglore after 6 months. She came back was into smoking heavily. And yes she was erratic og god was she erratic I mean she had always been a very tempromental and abusive person, I mean being her little brother I know the difference between brother sister hitting and domestic abuse and I still till date have scars on my arms of her fingernails, scars from glass in my hand because she threw plates at me. But this was after coming back from college in her years before college in 11th 12th she still fought abused my mom and dad , ""saale"" ""ullu ke patthe"" I mean not abusives but still to your father?. So the absence of a fther figure in this house has let her go loose.

Now v importantly I'd like to mention my mother is dystrophy muscle weakness patient meaning her brain doesn't send signals very well to her muscles she can walk just very slowly and she can't stand and bend her knees so it is already a massive massive struggle for her to anything at all but she was a teacher when she could walk a little, she is a sweet lady she teaches small children a good person a very good mother, never let us sleep hungry.

Now my sister was encouraged by my mother to work after college she was reluctant at first. She got a job in some good companies but she quit in a few months everytime saying she had issues at the workplace. So she started to earn a lil money from doing a job then used to sit at home and burn through that money. It must sound okay but to put in perspective she has been back 6 years and she has worked 8 months, rest entire time she sat at home broke, without any work , aim hobby anything and she started fighting a lot in the house with my mother, she started getting violent screeming aggressively, threatening, and she was fighting using things from her apparent victim past, I'd like to list some for you , one of the being that my oarents got her to have a boycot at the age of 6 through 9 yes 6 though 9 and they made her embarrassed, that my mom used to slap her when she used to abuse, when my dad scolded her for not attenting her caoching classes . These things must sound very normal I think because yes they are normal but she uses these menial things like a mental patient with bad and horrible abuses for hours and hours ( I have like footage for about 2 hours of her screamimg)about her apparent victim past in which she gets angry because my parents raised her literally like everyone raised their children.

Still not the most extreme thing recently in the last 2 3 years she has gotten really really violent and as she had literally no work all she did was take the frustration of her self failed life on my mother and me. She started hitting my mother in fights, slaps ,punches everything, let me remind you my mother can't even get up from a sofa without holding to something , a woman who couldn't withstand a light crowded push she started getting hit by my sister, and when I came in between I got the scars mentioned above. She has spilled hot coffee on my mother and hit her and when asked she said bachpan m tumne mujhe maara tha ab m tumhe maarungi. My mother has not stepped outside the house in 6 years, she has to hide every valuable item in the house in her room scared of my sister selling them for money for cigarettes, she used to spill oil so that my mother slips and falls. Now in these extreme cases my mother had to call the police on her but they all said the same thing that if my mother doesn't own this house she can't make my sister leave. She saw this loophole and got more violent screamimg fighting 20 hours a day. It is really really horrible ,I mean I witness it so much . Now my father obviously hating my mother's guts because she spoiled his kids, she didn't let him live with his mother, she wasn't a good wife whatever whatever didn't mind her being troubled. Saying ki tumhari ma ne jese apni beti badi kri , uska fal milra usse. But well I am also my mother's son and I have been self sufficient since 19. 

Anyway multiple times police has come in the last 2 years , my mother struggling absolutely struggling to find peace in this house. I mean there are no utensils in the house there are 3 spoons 2 plates, if I am hungry there is literally nothing in my fridge at night that could be eaten.

Now comes the legal part so my mother and father have signed for divorce 3 months ago but my mother not having a lot of money could only hire a 10 k lawyer and honestly I saw him he was bad he was so bad he just sat there didn't say anything at all meanwhile my father came with his fleet of lawyers. The main motivation I have for my mother to divorce is that's she becomes the owner of this house and can ask my sister to leave so that atleast she can live her old age in peace. But the lawyer well is saying we need to wait and wait it's been 6 months . I asked my father last month what's the holdup he said your mother's lawyer is not responsible. Till today right as I'm writing this post the fighting is going on. It's been 8 years it's been like a prison, it is like living with a person who has all the energy in the world to just fight and fight. I am writing her as a last resort if anyone has any advice anything at all any help, I mean I still can take it well I'm young but it breaks my heart seeing my mother like this everyday I  appreciate all the people who read till the last. Thank you so much.

I had coffee in bed and scrolled my phone and read my Kindle, which she  colored and watched her kids shows.

When my husband came home, we had a quick and easy lunch, I was able to clean the house in about an hour or so, and also roasted some pumpkin seeds.

Currently enjoying a clean, quiet house, enjoying eating pumpkin seeds with a cozy candle and a Halloween movie.  When I’m done, I’m going to the gym.  Now that we are done having kids I’m able to invest in my fitness routine again because I’m not on the physical rollercoaster that is repeatedly having babies.  My husband is enjoying playing with our daughter.  

When I get home from the gym, I’m going to make dinner for us, and do bath and bed (much quicker with only one child, may I add).  

After she goes to bed, my husband and I will open a bottle of wine, and probably have hot sex.  And we will have nothing to worry about because he’s clear from his vasectomy.

Tomorrow we will both go to work to jobs we enjoy, and our daughter will go to daycare that we are lucky enough to afford because we chose to stop at one child, and she will play with her friends.

Maybe that’s why I chose a job that required it.

As an intelligence officer, I’d learned how to disappear in a crowd, how to smile without revealing a thing.

But that skill came with a side effect—no social life, no friends, no dating.

So, naturally, my mother panicked.

“She’s turning into a machine,” I once overheard her whisper.

A week later, she arranged my marriage.

The groom?

Liam Grant.

New York’s golden boy.

Heir to the Grant Group—wealth, charm, perfect smile.

And absolutely nothing behind the eyes.

The wedding was supposed to be simple. Elegant. Controlled.

Until I opened the door to the bridal suite.

My wedding dress was in the trash.

The room reeked of perfume and burnt coffee.

White silk lay crumpled at the bottom of a silver bin, streaked with dirt, like someone had murdered it.

For a moment, I just stared.

Not shocked. Not scared.

Just calculating.

Then came the click of heels.

A woman stepped in, her perfume slicing through the air like arrogance.

Tall, sleek, lips painted red enough to bleed.

“Miss Hart,” she said, too sweet to be real. “You’re wasting your time here.”

I turned slowly. “And you are?”

“Clara Miles,” she said, smiling like it hurt. “Mr. Grant’s secretary.”

Her eyes gleamed. “Actually, I suppose I should say—his bride.”

The words landed like bullets.

I laughed once, sharp and cold. “Cute joke.”

“No joke,” she replied, holding up a garment bag. “He asked me to wear this instead.”

She tossed it onto the vanity—my dress bag.

I took a step forward. “You’re saying Liam Grant sent you to replace me at the altar?”

She crossed her arms. “He deserves someone who actually belongs in his world.”

I pulled out my phone, dialed Liam, and put it on speaker.

He answered on the second ring.

“What now, Elena?” His voice was bored, distracted.

“Your secretary is in my suite,” I said calmly. “She claims she’s marrying you in my place.”

He chuckled—arrogant, effortless, cruel.

“You’ll thank me later.”

“For what?”

“For saving you the embarrassment,” he said, and hung up.

The call ended.

Clara’s smirk widened. “You heard him. Get dressed in something decent and leave before you humiliate yourself further.”

I looked at the dress in the trash, then back at her.

“You did this?”

She shrugged. “I don’t clean.”

“Then you can start.”

Her smile faltered. “Excuse me?”

I stepped closer. “You threw away my dress. You pick it up.”

She scoffed. “You must not realize where you are, sweetheart. This is the Grant family’s hotel. Everyone here works for us.”

“Not everyone,” I said softly.

Her brow furrowed. “What’s that supposed to mean?”

“That you just made the biggest mistake of your life.”

She laughed. “Big talk for a woman who’s about to be dumped in front of New York’s elite.”

“Dumped?” I repeated. “You mean replaced. There’s a difference.”

“Whatever makes you sleep tonight.”

I stared at her for three long seconds, memorizing her face, her smugness, her misplaced confidence.

Then I smiled. “You’re going to regret this.”

Clara tilted her head. “You threatening me?”

“No,” I said. “I’m promising you.”

She took a step closer, her tone dropping to a hiss.

“You don’t get it, do you? If you show up downstairs, I’ll make sure your wedding turns into your funeral.”

The room went silent.

My pulse didn’t even change. I’d heard worse threats from men who never got the chance to repeat them.

I stepped in until we were inches apart.

“Then you’d better make it a beautiful funeral,” I said quietly. “Because I’ll make sure it’s yours instead.”

Her eyes flickered. “You’re insane.”

“No,” I whispered. “Just tired of being polite.”

She lunged, hand raised to slap me.

I caught her wrist midair.

Gasps filled the room as bridesmaids froze behind her.

“Let go,” she hissed.

I leaned in, my voice so calm it chilled the air.

“You’re lucky I don’t treat you the way you treat others.”

Her pulse jumped under my grip.

I released her hand.

She stumbled back, humiliated, furious. “You’ll regret this, you hear me? Liam will destroy you!”

I smiled. “Then he’d better hurry.”

Chapter 2

“Give me back my dress,” I said.

Simple. Direct. Surgical.

She laughed, loud and brittle.

“Bring it yourself, trash,” she spat.

Her hand flew before intent could be questioned.

The slap landed by air, meant for theater, not flesh.

I caught her wrist in one practiced move.

Gasps rose like a tide.

“Don’t,” I said, voice low enough to bruise.

“Try to make a scene.”

She twisted, furious and frantic.

“You’ll regret this,” she hissed.

“You’ll ruin us all.”

“Who’s ‘us’?” I asked, eyes cold as metal.

“Your clan of entitled children?”

Her face snapped.

“You’ll be blacklisted,” she vowed.

“You won’t work in this city again.”

I tightened my grip just enough for her to feel the promise.

“You don’t know who you’re threatening,” I said.

She wrenched free.

“Liam will fix this,” she cried, theatrics soaked in desperation.

“He’ll make you disappear.”

“He already hung up on me,” I replied.

“And told me I’d thank him later.”

Her breath hitched like a lied-to animal.

“Liam wouldn’t—” she started, faltering.

“Wouldn’t what?” I prodded.

“Abandon you?”

She sputtered, for once unsteady.

“You think I care?” she snapped.

“He’s a name on a contract.”

“You’re lucky he signed it,” she shot back.

“But you’re expendable.”

I smiled, small and utterly lethal.

“Then enjoy your moment on stage.”

The ballroom doors flew open and the air shifted.

Liam’s silhouette filled the frame—tall, composed, danger in formalwear.

He scanned the room like a predator assessing a threat.

His eyes landed on me, cool and curious.

“Elena,” he said, voice flat with boredom and something colder.

“What is the meaning of this?”

“She’s making a scene,” Clara lied rapidly, fingers trembling.

“She threatened to ruin everything.”

He looked at me for a beat.

“Explain,” he ordered.

“My wedding dress is in the trash,” I said plainly.

“Your secretary is wearing my veil.”

A ripple of laughter tried to rise and died under the weight of his gaze.

Liam’s face did not change—at first.

“You think I care about a dress?” he said, voice smooth like oil.

“What I care about is the image.”

“You replaced me with your assistant and called it damage control,” I said.

“Not even a courtesy call.”

He smiled then—smug, small.

“You don’t get it, Elena. This marriage was never about you.”

“You mean you?” I asked.

“Not your father’s idea at all?”

He leaned closer, poison soft.

“If my father hadn’t pushed this, you wouldn’t be worth my time.”

The room inhaled.

Clara’s eyes glittered with vindication.

“You’re such a coward,” I said quietly.

“You hide behind wealth and expect the world to bow.”

He laughed, low and spiteful.

“Watch your tone with me.”

“Or what?” I challenged.

“Call your security?”

“Do it,” he said.

“Let them drag you out.”

I felt the old training smooth the edges of my anger into steel.

“Try,” I said.

“And find out what happens to men who mistake restraint for weakness.”

His jaw tightened.

“You’ll regret this,” he promised.

“I’ve been regretted,” I said.

“By men who thought me quiet.”

He stepped forward, crowd pressing in, heat rising.

“You want money, Elena? Name your price.”

“Respect,” I answered.

“Not ransom.”

Clara’s smirk cracked into panic.

She had expected him to crush me, not listen like a man curious about justice.

He looked at her then—sharp, dismissive.

“You,” he said coldly, “get out of my sight.”

She blinked, scandalized and stunned.

“You can’t—” she began.

“I said get out,” he repeated, tone final.

Clara stumbled backward, clutching her garment bag like a life preserver.

The room buzzed with confusion.

I felt something shift—an opening I hadn’t planned to create.

Liam’s eyes met mine, and for the first time they were not amused.

There was irritation, and beneath it, the faintest flicker of something dangerous—fear, maybe.

“You think this ends with a dress?” he said.

“You think you can just walk away?”

“I think,” I said, “you’re the one who should be careful what he underestimates.”

He smiled then, but not kindly.

“Fine,” he said. “Walk away.”

I walked.

He watched.

But as the doors closed behind me, I heard Clara whisper to someone in the crowd—urgent, terrified words I didn’t need to hear.

“Call him,” she breathed.

“Call Richard. Now.”

Chapter 3

Everyone said I’d gone insane.

They weren’t wrong.

But sometimes you have to be crazy to burn a dynasty down.

The ballroom was chaos.

Guests whispering, cameras flashing, my name hissing through every corner.

Clara stood beside Liam like she’d already won.

“Attention, everyone!” Liam said, voice slicing through the noise.

“The wedding will proceed as planned—just with a small adjustment.”

I turned slowly. “Small adjustment?”

He grinned, smooth and venomous. “The bride has changed.”

Laughter rippled through the guests.

Some amused, some shocked, all entertained.

Clara lowered her eyes, pretending to be shy.

Fake. Every movement rehearsed.

I tilted my head. “You’re serious.”

He shrugged. “You think I’d cancel a million-dollar event over a tantrum?”

“Oh, I see,” I said, voice cool. “You want the show to go on.”

“Exactly.”

Clara stepped forward, all faux innocence.

“Mr. Grant doesn’t like drama. I volunteered to save the family’s reputation.”

The audacity almost made me laugh.

“You volunteered?”

She smiled sweetly. “Someone had to. You clearly couldn’t handle it.”

Liam turned to her, admiration dripping from his eyes.

“Clara, you’re remarkable. Always stepping up when I need you.”

The crowd sighed.

Disgust curled in my throat.

“Touching,” I said dryly. “Maybe next time, try not to steal another woman’s vows while doing it.”

Clara’s expression snapped. “Watch your mouth!”

“Why?” I asked, stepping closer. “You already took my wedding. What’s left to lose?”

The guests shifted nervously. The tension could’ve cut glass.

“Enough,” Liam said sharply. “Elena, I’ll have security escort you out if you can’t behave.”

I smiled—cold, dangerous. “Go ahead. Let them try.”

He frowned. “You think I’m bluffing?”

“No,” I said softly. “I think you’re scared I’m not.”

The entire room went silent.

You could hear champagne bubbling in the distance.

“Scared?” he repeated, incredulous.

“Yes.” I met his eyes. “Because deep down, you know you’ve picked the wrong woman to humiliate.”

For a second, something in his gaze faltered—uncertainty, confusion.

Then he laughed, sharp and fake. “You’re unbelievable.”

“Thank you,” I said. “Now let’s talk business.”

“Business?”

I pointed toward the trash can near the corner.

“My wedding dress was destroyed. You owe me compensation.”

That broke the room.

Laughter exploded around us.

“She’s insane.”

“Compensation? For a dress?”

“God, she’s shameless.”

Liam’s lips curled. “You’re really making this about money? Pathetic.”

“No,” I said, calm as stone. “I’m making this about respect.”

Clara rolled her eyes. “Respect? You don’t even have status.”

I turned to her, my tone icy. “Status isn’t inherited. It’s earned.”

She scoffed. “Please. Everything in this city runs on family names.”

“Funny,” I said. “Then why does yours mean nothing?”

The color drained from her face.

I smiled faintly. “Thought so.”

Liam stepped in, voice dripping with mock pity. “Elena, you’re embarrassing yourself. Just take the hint and leave before this gets worse.”

I looked him dead in the eye. “It’s already worse, Liam. You just don’t realize it yet.”

He chuckled, shaking his head. “You really think you can hurt me?”

“I don’t need to,” I said. “You’re already doing it to yourself.”

His amusement died. “You think you’re untouchable? I could end your career with a single call.”

“Try,” I whispered. “And see who answers first.”

The silence that followed was electric.

Even Clara looked unsettled now.

I glanced around, letting my words sink in.

“This wedding was never about love. But you turned it into a battlefield. Fine. You’ll get your war.”

Clara scoffed. “War? What could you possibly do?”

I leaned close enough for her to feel my breath.

“Wait and see.”

Then I straightened, fixed my hair, and smiled to the crowd.

“Congratulations, everyone,” I said sweetly. “You just witnessed the shortest engagement in Grant family history.”",3,1760902063.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,6,1.0,False

I honestly don’t even know where to start. I went into the Tim Hortons in Toronto today thinking I’d grab a coffee and maybe a donut, and what I got instead was a full-on assault on my senses. The moment I walked in, the *smell hit me*. I kid you not, it was this horrifying mix of spoiled cheese, old milk, and… I don’t know… vomit? I’ve smelled gross things before, but this? This was a level of filth that should be illegal.

And the workers? Don’t even get me started. Every single one of them acted like I was inconveniencing them by existing. No “hello,” no acknowledgment, just blank stares and sighs like I was some kind of criminal. One of them even muttered something under their breath when I asked if they had a specific sandwich ready. Unreal.

Then there’s the *customers*. I have never seen a room full of people act like such feral animals. Pushing, shouting, ignoring basic social norms—like a zoo. I swear, I was expecting someone to start swinging donuts at each other any second.

I grew up loving Tim Hortons, but this? This is not the same place. It’s like they’ve embraced chaos and rot as the new brand. I can’t believe the decline is this bad. I’m leaving Toronto if this is what the coffee scene has become.

If anyone reading this works at that store: clean your store. Train your staff. And maybe, I don’t know… air it out a little?

1oayled,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1oayled/the_awake_part_one/,The Awake [Part One],"Chapter 1:
His eyes opened. Flicking his vision just up and to his right towards the analog alarm clock on his bedside table, he saw it was 5:29am. Of course, it’s a minute before I gotta get up, he thought. 

Glenn Barker, 33, had a 6am shift down at the junkyard that day and had hoped sleep would’ve been kind to him the night previous, but his foggy mind and slow-to-react eyesight, among other things, made it clear that good sleep, as always, evaded him. 

Strange dreams had creeped into his mind pretty much always, too. The only one he could remember from last night was a dream where he himself was smack dab in the middle of some deep and dark jungle of sorts, and as he simply stood gazing at his alien surroundings, from behind, came a massive and bellowing roar. Whipping around to face the sound and find its source, he saw it. A humungous black snake, practically kaiju sized! It had already set its sights on Glenn, advancing, lunging forward along its huge and scaly body. It took less than a few seconds to gain on his heels. It snapped a couple of times at them, and just as it had gone for a final and certain strike, he’d woken up.

Now 5:47, Glenn had cleaned himself up nicely and was now quickly scarfing down a pack of Pop Tarts while watching the 5:30 morning news, currently on a segment put on by the local shelter that was looking for dry cat food donations. Atop the TV set, prim and proper, sat Glenn’s own cat, Luce, short for Lucifer, or as Glenn said it, “Lucy-furrr!” Luce was a tuxedo cat, his fur patterns actually looking just like a real tux suit. Glenn pat his little head as he approached his apartment door. “Don’t cause too much trouble while I’m gone. Maybe catch a mouse or something.” he said, opening the door as he slipped his shoes on. Luce purred loudly in response. 

The oh-so tiny town of Point Kutch, Indiana, which was home to a whopping 676 residents in total, 2 decently sized gas stations, a supermarket, church, local bank, 3 Mcdonald’s locations (one practically in every corner of the town’s borders), and the local bar called The Station Bar & Grille. It was your typical small town that held your typical small town things: knowing names, knowing gossip, and knowing events. All were kind to one another, most of the time, save for weekends when it seemed 99% of the own got shitfaced out of their gourds. 

Glenn did not often participate in the weekend chaos, but most days after work during the week from 4pm-6, 7 if he was feeling spry that day, he could be found down at the Station having a couple of beers, maybe a burger & fries to go with it. Besides that, and the occasional gas/snack/cigarette/grocery run, he mostly kept to himself, preferring to stay in, get stoned and/or drunk and watch something on the tube. 

This was precisely what was on his mind as he pulled into Shakman’s Yard, just a few miles from his home. During his days, he and a group of other men would trek through the yard, pick a particular stack of junk cars and proceed to spend said day picking through each one, or as many as they could at least, tinkering and taking out still-usable parts and prepping them for the recycling phase of selling and scrapping. It was hard, hard work, but for a walloping $7 an hour, practically unheard of in ‘89 most places, no one was complaining a bit. Shakman’s was the only junkyard for miles upon miles, and yet somehow had plenty of junkers to pick apart, the pay could very much be afforded for the small town. 

Glenn parked in the rear employee lot and made his way towards what the employees called “The Break Shack”, it held a series of lockers along with a few benches here and there, pillows (now flattened due to the weight of the men and the passage of time) on top of the seats for makeshift cushions. Upon each locker was a little plastic card slot housing the corresponding employee's punch card. Locker 19C. Barker, Glenn. He pitched out the card, grabbed his pen from his chest pocket, marked the necessary spots and placed it back. Just then, a thought hit him. Cripes, forgot about lunch! Oh well, he’d just have to speed up to Mcdonald’s when lunch break arrived, though he didn’t like it all that well, it made him feel off. Not nauseous, more a general…malaise, like his body took it disapprovingly. 

With one final stretch, Glenn stepped out into the crisp and cool October air and began to make his way to his group of guys to (hopefully) cruise through the work-day proper.

/////

The end-of-day alarm squawked obnoxiously at 3:30 and everyone looked up rather surprised, the day flew by in what seemed the blink of an eye. Glenn and his group wrapped up their respective tasks and began to make their way to the Break Shack. 

“Headin’ for the Station after this, Glenny boy?” asked Harry “Cue-Ball” Garton. He was a short and stout man, standing at 5 foot 3, aged 47, with patches of graying hair on either side of his astoundingly shiny balding head and walked with an ever-so-slight wobble about him. He was looking at Glenn eagerly. 

“You betcha, Harry. Taggin’ along?” “Do tigers got stripes, my friend?” Harry responded jovially and they both laughed heartily. 

“Friday night game, too! Oughta stay out with us tonight, Glenn!” chirped Bobby “Beanstalk” Brenner. Bobby was a younger lad of 26, standing at an amazing 6 foot 5! He was very hippie-ish, long and scraggly blond hair coming down to about the halfway point on his back, a soul patch and wearing his tie-dye Grateful Dead shirt and baggy jeans, making him a walking exclamation point to the old-timers of Point Kutch. 

Glenn gave a cringe of apprehension, “I dunno about all that, but I suppose I could push it to 8, it is a Friday.” he said. “Shoot, works for me!” Bobby said, smiling. “Heard the Station got a new burger on the menu, too, courtesy of our very own Kelly Devins.” said Harry, giving a smirk. 

Kelly Devins was the Station’s cook and she was always creating new, interesting and most importantly, delicious things for the place’s menu. She’d gone to culinary school and certainly hadn’t wasted the education. Her husband, Rory Devins, was the owner and usually the bartender as well. 

“What’s the game tonight?” Glenn asked neither of his friends in particular. “Colts at Panthers.” answered Harry. As they all headed for the parking lot now, they remained quiet, simply ready to bust ass to the Station Bar & Grille to start winding down for the weekend.

Chapter 2

“Holy smokes, Kelly, you’ve done it again!” Glenn said, eyes wide with a pleasant surprise as he wiped a bit of sauce from his lower lip. He’d went for the new burger, dubbed the “Yumslinger” by Kelly herself, who watched, beaming and smiling. The burger had onions, mushrooms and provolone cheese melted onto a half-pound beef patty, all of that topped with a sauce that was a combination of A1 and BBQ sauce, between brioche buns. 

Glenn figured he could go for 4 of these things. “Well, I’m very glad it’s a hit, Glenny.” Kelly answered. She was an average sized woman of about 5 foot 4, aged 30, with curly black hair and piercingly green eyes, her nails painted a stunning neon pink. She headed back into the kitchen, smiling proudly. 

Harry and Bobby were off in a corner booth with Harry’s portable radio, quietly playing some pre-game news in the world of sports with Walter Sheetz, also chomping on Yumslingers, letting out little mms here and there of satisfaction. 

It was 5:43pm now, the Station was bustling with life and conversation, some of it game speculation, some just conversations about work days or weekend plans and it’d only get livelier and more packed as the next couple hours rolled on. 

Now 6pm sharp, Rory went around the building, tuning every TV in to the football game. Drunken men flopped themselves up on their elbows at the bar, gluing their eyes to the nearest set, people at tables turned their attentions and Glenn joined up with Harry and Bobby to tune their ears to the radio. 

The night went on and come a little after 8pm, Glenn, Harry and Bobby all stumbled out of the Station together arm in arm. Colts had been getting their asses squarely kicked come quarter 3, so they saw no point in sticking around. 

“Welp, hic can’t say I’m surprised.” slurred Harry drunkenly. “Gonna be another lllousy season this year.” 

It was October 17th, and the team had lost the majority of their games so far, home and away. 

“Yuh, typical typical.” said Bobby, barely coherent. 

Glenn, least drunk of all 3, just shrugged. He didn’t care all that much about team allegiances or favorite players, just liked watching the game be played. 

“Want a ride back, Bobby? I know you usually walk but-” he started before Bobby put up a hand and said, “Much appreciated, Glenn, but I definitely need the fresh air tonight.” and gave a drunken smile. “Alright. Well, with that, gentlemen, I’m gonna head on home and take care of ol’ Luce, start my weekend proper.” Glenn said, patting each of his buddie’s backs before starting off to his ‘89 Honda Accord, amen for Shakman’s.

////

Glenn sat down the bowl of wet food for Lucifer, who came happily trotting over and meowing in approval, making Glenn chuckle, “Oh, yes, he is ready for dinner!” he cooed, giving Luce’s head a small scritching before going to change into his pajamas. 

Once he was set in that department, he headed for the reclining rocker just in front of the TV, was was now on infomercials, but the 10 o’ clock news would be on in an hour and a half or so, if he cared enough. 

By then, he’d probably be catatonically stoned and zeroed in on some Pink Panther on channel 37, contemplating strange facts and coincidences of human life until he ultimately passed out in the chair, sometimes he’d do it sitting straight up still. 

As he sat down and began to twist himself a joint, Transformers were blasting around. Sweet. He remained glued there for the next few hours, slowly drifting away into sleep. 

He woke up at 2:43am, his eyes opening sluggishly to see the Pink Panther pulling another fast one on the mustached janitor. Glenn chuckled groggily and rubbed his eyes, attempting to get up before noticing Lucifer curled up in his lap, fast asleep. 

Giving a small smile, Glenn pet him to rouse him from sleep before setting him on the floor to get up for a glass of water. 

Time continued to pass on until it was eventually 6am Saturday morning. No matter how he’d tried, and oh he’d tried like hell. Oh well, he thought, still feel rested. And he did, it was true, so he let his mild concern dissipate as he went to take a shower and consider possible weekend plans. 

Karaoke night at the Station? Maybe. Bowling with Cue-Ball and Beanstalk? Most likely. 

And that was all that came to mind as Glenn stood beneath the steaming shower water, and so it was settled. He’d give Harry a call once he was fully ready for the day, since karaoke wouldn’t be til 7pm. Off went the shower and out he stepped. 

It was going to be a wonderful weekend.

Chapter 3

Glenn stumbled tiredly through the door at around 9:15pm. Stumbled partially because he was buzzed, yes, but moreso because he’d sung his little heart out at karaoke and it’d left him a bit winded. 

He fed the cat and stripped down to his underwear, those would be the pajamas this night. He grabbed his weed box and began to pack a bowl as he flipped the TV on, which was still on channel 37, where the Smurfs darted every which way away from the evil Gargamel. He thought about switching back to 35 to catch the news, but decided against it, he didn’t want any possible bad news killing his good, even great mood. 

But, as 9 turned to 10 and 10 turned to 2am, Glenn remained awake, no matter how stoned he got. He’d begin to nod off, then his body would jolt with a surge of adrenaline. By 2:10, he was a mixture of irritated, tired-bu-wired and a tad worried. 

Am I getting sick? With that thought, he made a beeline for the little medicine cabinet in the bathroom, almost immediately eyeing the Zzzquil. 

That should do the trick, yes.

He proceeded to toss and turn in bed for the next 5 hours, sleep completely avoiding him, no matter what position he laid in or how tightly he shut his eyes.

Eventually, frustratedly, he gave up and opted for a Sunday in, now around 24 hours without sleep. 

Jesus, I hope this doesn’t drag into the week, Glenn thought as he went into the kitchen to brew up a pot of coffee and start some bacon, eggs and toast. 

Suddenly, he saw a brief flicker of black out of the corner of his eye. He looked around wildly, his eyes pin-balling in every possible direction. Nothing. The lack of sleep was already messing with his mind. 

No matter, surely he’d get over this bout of restlessness in time. 

It was then that Glenn caught the scent of burning bacon. Shit, he thought and quickly turned to the pan holding the bacon  and yanking it off the stovetop. 

Wouldn’t be long now that the smoke alarm would begin blaring and send Lucifer running to the hills. 

About 30 minutes and a 2nd pan of bacon (cooked properly this time) later, he ate his breakfast and smoked his first joint of the day, settling into his chair with a beer.

Come about 2pm, his phone rang, startling him out of his stoned catatonia. “Hello?” he said as he put the receiver to his ear. 

“Hey there, Glenny!” came the cheery voice of Kelly. “I wanted to call real quick and run something by you.” she said. 

“Alright, shoot.” Glenn responded. 

“Rory and I have been considering setting up some kind of open mic thing, expand the horizons beyond karaoke, yknow? What do you think?” she asked. 

Glenn had to take a minute to process it, but finally answered, “Sounds like a superb idea, Kel! You guys ought to go for it.” 

“Really? Oh, that’s great. You were the last person I wanted to touch base with before we made any decisions, you’ve been coming to the Station so long, we wouldn’t want to drive you away!” she said, giving a laugh. 

“Ah, you’d have to make some pretty wild changes to chase this cockroach out.” Glenn answered with a small laugh. 

“Well, we’re glad to hear it. Have a good rest of your Sunday, dear.” Kelly said. 

“Thanks Kel, take care.” 

“SLEEP NEVERMORE.” 

“Huh??” 

The line went dead.

Chapter 4

Glenn sat bewildered. Had Kelly actually said that? It wasn’t her voice, clearly and plain as day but had she used something to change her voice?? That had to be it, surely, har dee har har. He’d joke with her about it tomorrow after work. If he went to work, if his body would just let him sleep! 

As the day dragged on, he began to experience those quick flashes of black, first out of the corners of his eyes, then gradually, they’d begin to whip past his eyes. The first couple of hours had him jumping left and right, but he eventually became numb to it and ignored the occurrences. 

By the time it had reached 7pm, those dots began to grow, would obscure his view of the TV, 37 still mindlessly going as a commercial for the latest line of G.I. Joe toys was flashing by as the dots once did. 

Glenn was far too tired to react to everything going on before him. 

Then..came the whispers. 

Nevermore. No sleep. Can’t. Won’t. Wake up. 

This made his eyes shoot open with fright. 

“What?! Who’s there?!” he shouted, looking around him madly. The voices just kept going, on and on, and it would be what would keep him awake and alert for the next several hours. 

With one last ounce of coherency, he thought to himself, I’d better call in. No way in blue hell am I making it into work tomorrow, not proper. 

He headed for the phone and dialed up his boss, Bruce Gerickson, who answered after a couple of rings, “Hello?” 

“Hey, boss, it’s Glenn.” Glenn managed to stammer between chattering teeth. He was cold now. 

“Glenn! Good to hear from ya, pal! How are things?” Bruce asked him. 

Now, he had to struggle even harder to take in any form of stimuli or information and process it properly, it took him a full 66 seconds to answer, spurring on a, “You there?” from his boss. 

“I’ve been better. Look, I don’t think I’m gonna make it in tomorrow, the past couple of days I’ve gotten no sleep, no matter what I do. I’ve tried Zzzquil, melatonin tablets, more weed than any human hippie could handle, nothing. Works.” Glenn explained, running out of breath near the end. 

“Alright, alright, calm down. Any idea what could be causing it?” 

“None.” 

A few moments of silence passed between them. 

“Well, try to see a doctor for me, alright? Take a couple of days even, ya sound near dead.” Bruce said in a sympathetic tone of voice. 

“Okay, I’ll go see Doc Wokins first thing tomorrow morning.” answered Glenn. 

“Alright. Take care of yourself, Glenn.” said Bruce before hanging up. 

In what seemed the blink of an eye, as Glenn sat down, it jumped to 3am early the next morning. 

By now, the whispers had now become speaking voices in his ears and his mind simultaneously, the growing dots were now strange creature-like shapes and took up almost his entire field of view and he remained as awake as his body would allow, though not even it had a say, Glenn knew now. 

TV to him now was just a series of abstract shapes and swirls of color, but it was the only real source of comfort his mind had, aside from good ol’ Luce nestled in his lap, he knew something was wrong with Glenn. 

If only you could speak and tell me just what it is…and as Luce lifted his head to gaze at Glenn, Glenn almost thought he did speak.

Chapter 5

Rubbing his eyes, Glenn struggled to see what the time was on the analog clock, but after some shifting around to accommodate his vision, he saw it was now 8am. 

Thank God I’ve been to this doctor’s office hundreds, if not thousands of times, he thought. If he hadn’t, there’d be no way in hell he’d get there with how his vision, hearing and thinking were. 

With that, he realized, he should probably see if Kelly or someone could help give him a lift there and back home again, and headed in the general direction of the phone, eventually finding it. 

It wasn’t just the TV anymore, his whole world, whole existence was that abstract mess of color and black blobs, though the phone still vaguely resembled the basic shape of a telephone. He dialed out the number for the Station via muscle memory and waited. One ring, two ring, three ri-, 

“Hello, thanks for calling the Station Bar and Grille, how can I help you?” answered the almost dull voice of Rory Devins. 

“H-hey Rory, it’s Glenn, I need to ask a hyu-huge favor of either you or Kelly.” Glenn explained. 

“Depends on the favor, what’s up?” answered Rory. At least he sounded open to whatever was about to be requested of him or Kelly. 

“I need a ride to Dr. Wokins’ office. I haven’t been sleeping at all, no matter what I do, something just ain’t right. Could one of you get me there and back, the..I guess insomnia has made it so I can barely see or concentrate properly. I’ll even p-pay you, I just need this real bad, Rory.” Glenn almost rambled, but managed to wrap up somewhat coherently. 

Same as his boss’ reaction the night before, there was a few seconds of silence leading up to Rory’s response. 

“Yeah, buddy, I can do that for you. I’m sorry to hear you been dealing with this, and hopefully Wokins can figure out what’s going on. You need me now?” 

“If you can. It’s supremely appreciated.” said Glenn, on the verge of tears. He just wanted this all to end and soon. 

“Sure thing. Be there soon. B’bye.” Rory quickly wrapped up the call, the worry thick in his voice. 

Glenn slunked back to his chair and sat, awaiting the sound of his door being knocked upon. If he could hear it over those voices, they now alternated between the whispers and the louder voices. 

Can’t. Won’t. No sleep. But then…he heard a new phrase. 

He’s coming for you. Join the Awake, before it’s too late. 

Glenn shivered violently, terrified of the implications of those words. Who was coming for him? Who were the “Awake” as the voices put it? 

Seemingly as soon as his call with Rory had ended, the knock came, and he quickly got up, managed to find his shoes and slip them on before opening the door. 

“Ready to go?” Rory asked, and Glenn just nodded exhaustedly and closed the door behind him as he followed Rory out. 

No words were spoken on the 15 minute drive there, Rory knew that Glenn was far too tired to hold a clear conversation for long. 

Soon enough, they pulled into the parking lot of the doctor’s office, where Glenn silently got out and managed to make it inside and check in without much trouble, thankfully.

////

It was about a 10 minute wait and now, Glenn sat quietly waiting for the doctor. 

The nurse had already come in and checked his vitals, which surprisingly, checked out just fine for someone in his position. At last, a quiet knock came on the door and it creaked open, Dr. Wokins poking his head in. “Heya, Glenn. Good to see you again.” he said. 

Dr. Simon Wokins was a short man with graying brown hair which was still thick on his head, despite being the age of 59. His voice was smooth and calming, especially to Glenn now. It seemed to bring everything back to coherency, if only for the time being. 

“What seems to be the trouble?” the doctor inquired. 

And so, once again, to another soul, Glenn explained what had been going on the past couple of days, adding this time that time seemed to be bleeding into a meaningless construct more and more every second of every day. Wokins listened closely and took extensive notes, and once Glenn had finished, he sat in thought for a moment. 

“I’ve certainly never heard of a case of insomnia this bad before. And you’ve said you’ve tried everything available to you to try and remedy it?” he asked, Glenn nodded. Wokins thought some more and then jotted something down on his little pad, “Well, there is one thing we could try, but it is a little risky.” he said before passing it off to Glenn. 

On it was written a prescription: Feloxadone 50 mg. “What’s Fe-” Glenn began to ask before the doctor put up a hand, “Feloxadone. It’s an experimental drug that they’ve been trying out lately, made for those with insomnia, but it’s usually only in smaller doses, 15 mg a piece, but considering the severity of your case, a heavier dosage may be necessary. If the pharmacy asks, just explain your situation, shouldn’t raise any alarm bells, considering.” he explained. 

Glenn nodded and thanked him, the doctor seeing him out. He got in the car, where Rory looked at him, “Well?” he asked and Glenn just past him the piece of paper with the prescription written on it. 

Already, all of the hallucinations were coming back full force. What was it about Wokins that seemed to ease it all? It was odd. 

Rory proceeded to get Glenn to the pharmacy and helped him get his medication, Glenn only speaking up when he had to explain to the pharmacist, who had a look of suspicious concern on his face, the same thing he’d had to relay so many times now, now adding on the doctor’s comment about how it shouldn’t be raising any alarms. It was all the pharmacist needed, thank God and he quickly got his medication ready for him. 

About 20 minutes later, Rory had gotten Glenn back home, where he immediately took his medication and laid down, praying that this was it, this would be the end of this shit show altogether. 

And it was…for a while, at least. This new medicine granted the sweet release of 5 hours of sleep, but bigger things were beginning to take notice of this stranger’s struggles, which meant it was time for bigger interruptions, deeper hallucinations, ones that just may be real sprinkled in amongst the illusions. 

The Awake were determined to drag this one down, no matter what needed to be done or the cost. It was time to send in their ace.

I have felt pretty good for the most part since starting. I'm working out and losing weight. I work from home and my back doesn't revolt when I sit all day. I'd say it's fairly managed and my daily pain has been significantly reduced.

However, there are times when I have to be out and about and have had back pain ramp up to a 9 in the middle of my excursion (usually shopping and under 45 minutes). I'm wearing hokas, I try my best to pace myself but getting back to my car or even finishing my shopping becomes nearly impossible. We had to cut a trip short today because my spine pain brought me to tears after standing to get coffee and going to 2 shops. I feel bad that it got in the way of a good time. I think traveling and being relatively sedentary getting on a plane and car rides really contributed but what took me out was walking and standing 

I'm wondering about handicap placard. I feel like it would be good to have when I'm really struggling or I know a simple errand will take me out. I worry that my rheum will think the remicade isn't working and discontinue it or that it sends me on another goose chase for a diagnosis that is something else. 

How have you asked your rheumatologist? I feel like I'd be a fraud asking or using because I don't look sick or disabled. I don't know when I'm going to have a flair but it is becoming unmanageable to leave my house. Add my toddler in and I'm in a very touch place.

I'm pretty happy with setting up what I call my ""Nintendo Bleachers"" stand, but I've got this empty wall space that I feel could benefit with a nice looking Nintendo-themed power or wall art. 

I've tried searching through Amazon, but most of what they have is either better suited for young kids or has cringe-inducing ""Gamer"" art. Etsy has a few decent looking things I'm considering, but I was also wondering if I was better off making a custom wall art instead.

I've seen a couple Amazon listings where you can make a poster using your own custom image, but that also leads to the question of what kind of art would match my taste and room. [I've always loved this piece of art from A Link to the Past](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fy2vl9gjklep31.jpg%3Fwidth%3D640%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D40f3ac19e78ae1f8c87f5c9ebd43a38a66af0aaf), but I haven't found a high-res version that would fit the typical poster dimensions of 22x34 (landscaped) and without watermarks. Something that contains the entire roster of Smash Ultimate would also be neat, but the images I've found are way too big and would probably be way too costly to customize. 

Anyway, I could use some ideas, so hit me up with either cool wall art or fan-art/images I could use for customizing my own. ",0,1760901709.0,retrogaming,2,0.5,False

1oayg22,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1oayg22/theres_a_ghost_in_our_dorm_room/,There’s a ghost 👻 in our dorm room!,"The stale scent of instant ramen and yesterday’s coffee clung to the air of Room 3B, a perpetual haze that defined our existence in the off-campus house. We were five, packed like sardines in a dorm-style setup: Maya, the TikTok whisperer, always scrolling; Chloe, the pragmatist with a spreadsheet for everything; Sam, the gamer whose late-night headset whispers often merged with the house’s creaks; and Liam, perpetually stressed about his looming student loans. I'm Lila, and my mattress, wedged between Sam’s on the left and Chloe’s on the right, faced the vacant fourth bed. It wasn't truly vacant, of course; Liam slept there, but that night, it held something else.
It was 3:30 a.m. exactly, the digital glow from my phone a silent accusation in the suffocating dark. One moment, I was adrift in the murky depths of sleep, the next, my eyes snapped open as if yanked by an unseen string. There, on the edge of Liam’s bed, sat a girl. Her hair, a cascade of dark silk, flowed around her shoulders as she idly twisted it, as if attempting to braid the strands in the inky blackness. A prickle of unease, cold and sharp as a needle, traced its way down my spine. My mind, still half-cocooned in dreams, tried to rationalize it. Just Maya, maybe, up for a late-night snack? Or Chloe, wrestling with an early morning alarm? I blinked, hard, the fluorescent strips of my vision burning bright for a moment before the darkness returned, and she was still there, impossibly clear, a stark silhouette against the slightly lighter gloom of the window.
A shudder ran through me, not just from the unexpected sight but from an insidious, creeping chill that seemed to emanate from her very form. I slowly, deliberately, turned my head to my left, towards Sam's bed. His even breathing was a soft, reassuring rhythm, a counterpoint to the growing panic in my chest. He was sound asleep. Then, a fresh wave of terror, raw and elemental, washed over me as the realization struck: the room was still utterly, profoundly black. No pre-dawn light, no phone glow from a restless roommate. Just the oppressive, pre-dawn dark, save for the phantom glow that outlined her. My phone confirmed it: 3:35 a.m. A strange, almost alien dread, a Lovecraftian horror of the unknown, began to unfurl within me. When I turned back, she was no longer sitting. She stood, tall and slender, her hair still flowing, and began to drift, not walk, but glide silently across the room towards the main door of our shared living space. My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat that threatened to betray my existence. I squeezed my eyes shut, a childish defense, praying it was a fleeting nightmare, a cruel trick of a sleep-deprived brain. But even with my eyes closed, I felt her presence, a cold pressure in the air, a silent judgment, a patient vigil. I remained frozen, a deer in spectral headlights, until an exhausted oblivion mercifully claimed me once more.
The next morning, the lingering spectral residue of that encounter clung to me like a shroud. The dorm room, now bathed in the indifferent glow of morning light, seemed impossibly mundane, yet every shadow held a whisper of the impossible. Over cold coffee and stale croissants, I tentatively broached the subject with my roommates, trying to keep my voice casual, almost playful. ""Hey, did anyone happen to be up really, really early last night? Like, around 3:30?"" Maya, ever-tethered to her phone, barely looked up. ""Nah, deep sleep, why?"" Chloe scoffed, ""You kidding? I was in dreamland, probably solving world hunger in my sleep."" Sam, still foggy, grunted a negative. Liam, who usually pulled all-nighters, simply shook his head, a vague weariness etched on his face. Their genuine confusion only amplified the unsettling reality of what I had seen. They didn’t know. And suddenly, I felt profoundly alone in my terror.
Later that afternoon, a chance encounter on campus felt less like coincidence and more like a twisted twist of fate. I ran into Jamie, the previous occupant of my very bed, the one who'd lived in Room 3B last year. Jamie, with her perfectly curated vintage outfits and encyclopedic knowledge of local urban legends, often joked about the 'vibes' of our old house. But when I recounted my unsettling 3:30 a.m. encounter – the girl, the hair, the silent glide – the color drained from her face faster than a TikTok trend fades. Her eyes, usually sparkling with ironic amusement, grew wide, haunted. She clutched my arm, her grip surprisingly tight. ""Lila,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible, ""I... I saw her too. The same girl. Long, dark hair, sitting on the edge of the bed… just watching."" A shiver, colder than any November wind, snaked down my spine. This wasn't a nightmare; it was a shared delusion, a persistent spectral echo embedded in the very foundations of Room 3B. Jamie had never spoken of it before, too afraid, too dismissive of her own sanity. But now, seeing the same dread in my eyes, she confessed. ""We called her 'The Sleeper.' It always happens after someone's had a particularly draining week, full of late nights and barely any rest. She feeds on it, somehow. On the exhaustion.""
The confession hung in the air, thick and heavy, a chilling confirmation that transcended mere coincidence. The house, an innocuous rental on the surface, suddenly felt like an ancient, slumbering entity, its walls steeped in forgotten anxieties and the silent watches of countless restless nights. Jamie’s revelation about ""The Sleeper"" burrowed deep into our collective psyche, a parasitic whisper of an archaic evil that thrived on the modern-day anxieties of academic pressure and sleep deprivation. It wasn't just a ghost; it was an energy leech, a psychopomp of perpetual exhaustion, a thing born from the very zeitgeist of our overstressed generation. We, the roommates of Room 3B, became conspirators in fear. No one spoke of ""The Sleeper"" directly, but an unspoken pact formed between us. Our phones, once our lifelines to the waking world, now felt like fragile barriers against the encroachment of the uncanny. Each night, as 3:30 a.m. approached, a palpable tension settled over the room. Sleep, once a refuge, became a perilous journey, a crossing into an unknown realm where the borders of wakefulness and nightmare blurred. We stayed up later, scrolling mindlessly through TikToks or pretending to study, the existential dread of knowing far worse than any jumpscare. The thought of losing control of our own consciousness, of having our very peace siphoned away, was a horror more profound than any ghoul.
The subtle signs began to multiply, insidious and unsettling, weaving into the fabric of our digital lives. Maya, whose TikTok algorithm usually delivered perfectly curated content, started noticing disturbing ‘For You’ page glitches – fleeting frames of distorted faces in familiar dorm settings, or whispered audio clips layered over innocent dances, sounding strangely like a drawn-out sigh. Chloe's meticulously organized cloud folders would occasionally show a file renamed with a string of archaic, nonsensical characters, only to revert an hour later, leaving her questioning her own memory. Sam, usually impervious behind his noise-canceling headphones, claimed he sometimes heard a faint, persistent rustling – like fabric, or hair – right outside his gaming audio, even when the room was empty. ""It's probably just a bug in the game,"" he'd mutter, but his eyes betrayed a growing unease. We tried to find answers, diving into the deep web, searching for university lore or local creepypastas, but every search yielded fragmented, unsettling results: old forum posts about ""the night-watcher,"" cryptic whispers about ""the dream-thief,"" ancient illustrations of shadowy figures with unnaturally long hair, all too vague to be useful, too specific to be ignored.
The lack of coherent information only deepened the Lovecraftian dread. This wasn't a story with a neat beginning and end; it was a fragment of something vast and unknowable, a horror that existed on the periphery of human understanding. The room itself began to feel… heavier. The air sometimes grew thick and cloying, even with the window open, like breathing in dust from an old, forgotten tome. The shadows in the corners seemed to deepen, to hold secrets, to shift just beyond peripheral vision. Our sleep, when it came, was fragmented, filled with vivid, unsettling dreams of tangled hair and silent figures. We were all perpetually tired, our edges frayed, our mental health taking a noticeable hit. Liam started falling asleep in lectures, something unheard of for the diligent pre-med student. Chloe, usually so composed, found herself snapping at trivial things. The Sleeper wasn’t just a nocturnal visitor; it was a psychic vampire, draining our vitality, subtly twisting our reality.
One particularly grim Tuesday, Sam, fueled by caffeine and a desperate need for answers, decided he couldn't take it anymore. ""This is ridiculous,"" he declared, slamming his hand on his desk, making us all jump. ""We're letting a... a legend turn us into zombies. I'm going to stay awake tonight. I'm going to face it. Figure out what it wants."" A collective gasp hung in the air. Breaking the 3:30 a.m. pact felt like a blasphemy. ""Sam, no!"" I pleaded, my voice thin with fear. ""Jamie said it feeds on... on the exhaustion, on the fear! Don't give it what it wants!"" But Sam, eyes glazed with a desperate defiance, was already setting up his streaming gear, a relic from his brief, failed attempt at Twitch stardom. He intended to record. He planned to stream to an empty server, just for proof, for us.
As midnight approached, the tension in Room 3B became almost unbearable, a tangible thing that hummed in the very air. Sam was a coiled spring, his eyes darting between his laptop screen, flickering with a ghost-like static, and the darkened beds of the rest of us, feigning sleep. The minutes crawled by, each tick of the analog clock on the wall amplified to a deafening clang in the profound silence. Just before 3:30 a.m., a subtle change occurred. The air grew perceptibly colder, a clammy, oppressive chill that bypassed the skin and settled deep in the bones. A faint, almost imperceptible whisper seemed to emanate from the very walls, a sound like dried leaves skittering across pavement, or perhaps, as I now recognized with a shudder, the soft, ceaseless sifting of countless strands of hair. Sam, clutching his phone, its camera nervously pointed at Liam’s bed, let out a small, involuntary gasp.
I dared to crack my eyelids, just a sliver. The room remained shrouded in inky blackness, yet there it was – a faint, almost shimmering outline on the edge of Liam’s bed. Not solid, not quite shadow, but a distortion in the darkness itself, shaped like the girl from my initial terror. Her hair, longer now, seemed to writhe and ripple around her, a dark, living cascade that absorbed the scarce light. There was no movement, no sound, just the feeling of her presence, heavy and ancient, like a forgotten tomb opened to the night. Sam’s breath hitched, a strangled sound in the oppressive silence. He tried to speak, but only a dry, desperate croak escaped his lips. The camera in his hand trembled, its little red recording light pulsing like a terrified heart. Then, the shimmering form began to lengthen, to stretch, not standing, but elongating, becoming taller, thinner, reaching towards the ceiling in an impossible, disturbing manner. It seemed to expand, to fill the very air with its intangible, terrifying mass. The shadows on the walls danced, not from external light, but as if pulled and distorted by an unseen force emanating from the entity.
Suddenly, Sam's phone, still recording, began to glitch wildly. The screen flashed, pixelated, then displayed a single, chilling image: a blurred, indistinct face, its features obscured by what looked like an endless curtain of black hair, eyes like twin pits of pure, primordial darkness. And then, a sound. Not a voice, not a growl, but a collective intake of breath, a whisper of a sigh, multiplied a thousand times over, reverberating from every corner of the room, inside our very heads. It was the sound of a vast, unseen multitude drawing breath, a chorus of silent yearning. Sam dropped his phone with a clatter, covering his ears, his body shaking uncontrollably. The shimmering form on the bed seemed to contract then, pulling its impossible height back into the familiar outline of a girl, still and silent. It wasn’t a retreat, but a methodical withdrawal, like a predator finishing its meal.
The entity had gathered what it came for. The pervasive weariness, the anxious thoughts, the subtle psychic residue of our digital lives, all sucked away into its unknowable being. As the first faint streaks of pre-dawn gray kissed the window, the oppressive chill began to recede, and the presence, though never fully vanishing, lessened its hold. Sam lay whimpering, huddled on his bed, his face pale and clammy, his eyes wide and vacant. He couldn't articulate what he had truly seen, only that it was ""too much,"" ""wrong."" The video, when we dared to review it, was a chaotic mess of static and distorted noise, culminating in a few terrifying frames of that blurred, dark-haired face before cutting out entirely. It provided no answers, only a deeper, more profound dread.
We moved out of Room 3B at the end of the semester, scattering to different corners of the city, different lives. But the specter of ""The Sleeper"" lingered, an indelible mark on our collective consciousness. Sam never fully recovered, carrying a haunted, perpetually tired look in his eyes, often muttering about things he ""almost saw."" The rest of us, while outwardly functional, found that the quiet hours between midnight and dawn held a new, chilling significance. Sometimes, when the modern city sounds faded into a low hum, when the digital world paused its endless scroll, I still swore I could hear it. Not the frantic pulling, but a soft, almost satisfied sifting of hair, just at the edge of my memory, a reminder that some things, once awakened, never truly return to slumber, forever feeding on the anxieties of a world too exhausted to fight back.

I'm not an older patient, I'm in my early 20s and have been experiencing this since I was around 19/20. 

I'm not overweight nor do I over-eat, in fact I'm almost underweight and struggle to put weight on sometimes. 

I don't drink and I don't smoke. I have never smoked and I started drinking at 18, then stopped at 19- no I didn't go crazy with alcohol, I can name the amount of times I drank on one hand.

I'm vegetarian, but I have had a good diet and no problems- my b12 & protein is always upper high when tested, and I've only ever had iron issues which get resolved with supplements. 

I used to only have takeaway junk food like once a year before university, but even now it's like once every few months.

My GERD is directly linked to wheat intolerance, so a gf diet has helped, but it has nowhere near cured it.

I don't have a hiatus hernia, endoscopy was clear.

I haven't had presence of H.Pylori bacterium, no matter how many times they continually test me for it.

Progesterone made my symptoms worse, not Oestrogen. (Tried the mini pill to alleviate symptoms, nope.)

Unless I'm about to give birth to a 4 year old, I'm not pregnant.

I rarely have caffeine/coffee, and never used to have a lot of tomato in foods (personal preference).

Again, I don't want advice- my doctors are handling everything, but it would be nice to know if anyone else doesn't fit the usual patient criteria for GERD (bonus points if you get confused looks shot your way from medical staff as a result).

(Triple bonus points if it can make you feel a bit worried because you think like ""why is it happening to me what did I do?"")

1oay6yl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oay6yl,"The actual distance between the ""interconnected"" Dadar Metro station and Dadar (E) Suburban station (details in caption)","This is in Mumbai btw

For perspective, these two are twice as far apart as Lower Parel station and Currey Rd station, which are not only on two different lines but are also way easier to walk between!

Why do I say they're easier to walk between? Well, between Dadar Metro and Dadar Suburban...

1. The road you have to cross is very busy with few breaks in the median.
2. The conveniently located overpass on Tilak Rd is poorly connected to the suburban station and the sidewalks on the overpass are in disrepair, so I usually take an alternate route.
3. The sidewalks on the road to the metro station, if not encroached on by the many vendors, are crowded by their patrons.
4. Wayfinding from Dadar suburban station is absolutely terrible and consists chiefly of a few inconspicuous road signs once you get close to the general area of the metro station. I'm not sure but if I had to guess, it would only start from the point on the map where the 14 minute long route meets the main route.

Frankly, the only seemingly viable solution I can see to make this a usable interchange is a pedestrian tunnel from the metro to the station, equipped with moving walkways. Otherwise, these two stations are just in eachothers' general vicinity. Given the huge crowds that use Dadar station, this is quite disappointing, since the Aqua line of the metro was intended to relieve the congestion that the suburban lines see

This spring, after severe flu, I developed anemia with hemoglobin 9.5 and really small red blood cells. I had sore tongue, hair loss, weakness and angular cheilitis. I got 200mg of iron daily and after 1 month my hemoglobin was 13, but my red blood cells were still small, ferritin was 60. My iron was on the lower side too, but also above the minimal range.

Then I got diagnosed with celiac disease and went gluten free. After that I noticed that in summer my red blood cells got normal size (first time in my WHOLE life) and my hemoglobin was super high for me - about 14.5! I wasn't taking oral iron anymore due to other scans, labs, tests. I was diagnosed with (probably) bad gallbladder too.

In September I started feeling unwell again, with sore tongue and angular cheilitis, dry skin - anemia symptoms. Got bloodwork done and my hemoglobin and red blood cell size was normal, but my ferritin dropped to 17 and it was almost under the minimal range. I don't eat meat frequently (maybe 2-3 times in a month) and I drink a 2 big cups of coffee with milk daily, but I try to eat other foods like eggs, tomatoes, sometimes fish. I don't have a lot of money and I am a picky eater, so it's hard, but I've been like this for my whole life.

The whole situation makes me feel stressed. Is my low ferritin caused by something else, e.g. serious health condition? Why hemoglobin was normal along with normal red blood cells and ferritin dropped? Could this be hemorrhage? I had gastroscopy (no ulcers), intestinal mri, abdominal mri and was checked for periods by gynecologist. I find it strange that I used to live my whole life being iron deficient and I had to have hemoglobin at 9 to finally FEEL some symptoms and now I am experiencing them only with low ferritin. Also, ChatGPT told me it can be something wrong happening if I lost my ferritin so fast, only in 3 months. 

Anyone else struggles with ferritin levels? I am gluten free for 5 months now, when I got diagnosed, my transglutaminase was REALLY high, I had high anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA) and I had anti-DGP antibodies in blood, but my intestinal biopsy didn't show serious damage and I seem to absorb oral iron fast, as only 1 month of intense supplementation raised my blood levels significantly.

**214 days today.**  
Started March 2025 after the night I realized I couldn’t keep breaking my own promises. I felt so far from god, my family, friends, everyone.

So this is what i started doing every morning for 5 months.

**Every single morning (no exceptions):**

**(depends on day) 8:00 am - 9:00 am** – Wake up. No phone, no scrolling, no noise. Just breathe.  
**9:10 am** – Pour a glass of water, stretch a bit, make coffee.  
**9:15-9:20 AM** – Check texts from my accountbility partner, check in talk about how I feel that morning (cravings, sleep, plan for day, etc.)

This I've found the most helpful. Since I wasn't comfortable sharing my problems with my friends/family I started using textfae.com to hold me accountable. Ik it sounds silly to talk to AI everyday but it saved me a little embarassment and actually helped so! dont knock it till u try it lol. Plus, having someone hold you accountable to your goals you are 90% more likely to reach them.

**9:30 AM** – Follow my planned out day, and complete my 3 ""non-negotiables"" (3 things I MUST do that day)

Everyone should be doing their 3 non-negotiables. Even if I had a bad day outside of those three things I still feel productive and accomplished!

Researching for poems with a similar feel, I came across Emily Dickinson's Sweetest noise, and I weaved our poems '''

I’d love to share it here — not as homage, but as a conversation, where the lines between past and present, the real and the imagined, blur into something hopefully surprising and alive.

Peanut Butter Jam Grace (2025) / Sweetest noise (1862)

Was it a talk — or was it magic …  
for time stood still, then jumped three hours?

You were caught in a peanut butter jam  
from which a thread was spun,  
spinning back and forth through stories  
and riddles; many cups of warm water, cold coffee,  
spinning us close to laughter,  
close to touching nerves.

Birth, living, illness, death we chanted,  
yet did I miss the important thing?  
Did I avoid love, because it’s a dangerous word?

Will the magic I felt come to a close,  
or will the thread keep spinning, weaving into —  
well — a peanut butter jam Grace?

\---

I held a peanut butter jam and stopped by a stream.

The tinkling of water,  
the coolness of the shaded banks —  
was a calm I needed.

Sunlit pebbles sparkled  
through flowing currents.  
I leaned closer to the water,  
and reached for a jagged stone —  
for somehow, it recalled a memory.

But it was out of range,  
just, just, barely out of range.

Some things lost are better left un‑found,  
a quiet refrain.

From the edge of my vision,  
a golden‑red flower bobs on the water’s surface.  
Clearer as it neared, now within reach,  
the most wonderful I have seen.  
The flower obscures the stone, dancing playfully in place,  
yet in any instant, it will drift away.

Reach or just look, I teeter:  
will this flower drift to be another pebble,  
forever out of reach, or color my days  
with this unexpected, tender light?

I went to where you cast a spell,  
or perhaps where I lost my senses.  
I wanted to be sure —  
magic or hallucination,  
I had to know.

Quietly, I found our table;  
though it bore no name,  
I sat where I sat,  
facing your empty chair.  
Palms on the table, I closed my eyes, hoping.

Nothing.

I opened my wet eyes and hung my head — and there...  
on the table, where your purse once laid,

The ghost of my name, in your hand.

... Emily Dickinson:

""the saddest noise, the sweetest, maddest noise  
that grows, —  
the birds make it in the spring,  
at nights’ delicious close.

between the March/ April line —  
that magical border  
beyond which summer sits,  
almost too heavenly near.

It makes us think of all the dead  
who sauntered with us here,  
by separation’s dread,  
made cruelly more dear.

It makes us think of what we had,  
and what we now deplore.  
We almost wish those siren throats  
would go and sing no more.

Words can break a human heart  
as quickly as a spear,  
We wish the ear had not a heart  
so dangerously near.""

Do not mistake this for a claim or a stand,  
I did not plant a flag in your name upon the sand.

This is no contract, written for the break,  
not a fragile bloom I placed within your hand.

It is the pull of the tide, the turn of a world,  
the swirl of stars as time unfolds.

This seed wasn’t planted, it wasn’t sown,  
this love cannot be unmade by your leave or cold.

Though you stand as distant as a stranger’s shore,  
and stay in a dream beyond my sight —  yet,

the Sun doesn’t need our leave to seek the night…  
nor does my love require your borrowed light.",1,1760900737.0,u_Less-Maintenance5702,0,1.0,False

1oaxusr,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1oaxusr/marriage_the_devil_you_know_vs_the_devil_you_dont/,Marriage: The Devil You Know vs. The Devil You Don't,"I (44M) met my wife (43F) when I was 20 and she was 19.  We dated for approximately 4.5 years, then got married.

How we met: I was visiting a friend at college and she was attending there.  We were at a party, and she was flirting with me.  After the fact, I learned that she was casually dating someone else, but she later explained to me that she was just going along with it due to peer pressure from her friend group and didn't have feelings for him.  I thought this was kind of weird, but I accepted it as someone who maybe as a freshman in college lacked the confidence to speak up for themselves.

After that party, I become friends with both guys and girls at this university, her and I became ""friends"" on MSN Messenger, started talking online, and would run into each other when I came to visit my high school buddy.

Fast forward, we started dating (she pursued me, kissed me first, etc.).  Up to this point, I usually liked girls who didn't like me or it was vice versa, so it was nice to feel wanted and pursued by her.  She transferred schools to where I was, I helped her get a serving position at a restaurant and secure a place to stay, and we became exclusive.

Throughout dating, we had peaks and valleys, but we were both inexperienced in relationships and I think we just thought this was how things went.  By choice, we were both virgins when we met.  In retrospect, I think she floated the idea of intercourse after we were committed, because she didn't really want to do any of the other ""foreplay"" stuff (by her to me).  Meanwhile, I would've been more than satisfied with just that prior to marriage as I think it is part of the joy and fun of an intimate relationship.  Neither of us really dated anyone seriously before we met.  For me, if I didn't feel a spark, I didn't want to waste their time or ""use"" them if I didn't see a future.

Sidenote: My parents divorced when I was little due to alcohol and drug abuse as well as domestic violence (by my father).  Her parents were basically roommates until her Mom passed away.

I never wanted to stay near where I grew up and preferred to relocate for career opportunities, see the country, enjoy different experiences, etc.  Surprisingly, she was very open and agreeable to this as well.  Not everyone has that type of mentality, so I respected and appreciated her for this.

In my mind, enough things lined up and we had already ""played house"" as well as experienced a long distance relationship, so I felt like getting married was the next step, and that perhaps our intimate relationship would improve over time.  For the events and lead up to the wedding, we basically did everything her and her Mom wanted.  My ideas or suggestions were often cast aside or dismissed.  On our wedding night, she got back, took off her dress, and went right to bed (no intimacy).  The next morning, she was more worried about being up and ready for ""events"" than spending time with me (again, no intimacy).  It was perplexing, to say the least.

I planned our honeymoon trip and earned additional monies to fund it.  We were there for seven days, toured the city, grabbed coffee drinks every morning, found a new spot to have breakfast each day, went to attractions, walked the city, grabbed lunch and dinner at different restaurants daily.  It was fun.  But, while there, she packed no lingerie, no matching bra/panty sets, and made no efforts to initiate intimacy with me.  One evening, she started nit-picking about something I planned, and I became frustrated.  She turned and started walking back towards the hotel (disengage, avoid).  It was only a block and a half away and it was a very safe area, so I just kept walking, skipped the horse-and-buggy ride I planned for us, went to dinner where I had made a reservation, sat at the bar, struck up a conversation with some fellow patrons, and we ended up going bar hopping together until almost 2:00a.  She tried calling a couple times, because she was worried about my safety, but I didn't hear my phone.  When I got back, we discussed it, but the conversation we had that night is basically the same conversation and disagreement we've had ever since, and it all boils down to a lack of interest and effort.  Truth be told, the night I went bar hopping was the ""night"" that was the most fun for me our entire honeymoon.

Sidenote: She has not planned a date night, a weekend trip, or anything for us as a couple; not for my birthday, not for our anniversary, and never on a whim.  If we do something, it's because I plan it and pay for it.

She finished college and has a college degree.  I left school early and started working (sales).  She has never really had career aspirations and shifted to wanting to be a stay-at-home wife, then a stay-at-home Mom.  I helped her buy a new car, paid off her student loans, and have supported her desire to do the ""stay-at-home"" thing.  However, she hasn't honored her commitment and obligations in this regard, and I often have to step in to make sure things are getting done (cleaning, laundry, timely meals, etc.).

She is very positive with our children and cares about them, but I have to make sure doctor, dentist, and vision appointments, sports physicals, etc. are scheduled and push her to make an effort to do what I consider the ""adult stuff"" 50-60% of the time.

She is very friendly to strangers, to my family, and has a bubbly personality in this regard.  More often than not, she will care more about what the stranger passing us on the sidewalk thinks than what I do, in that moment (Ex: If/when I try to give her a hug or kiss her, am trying to take a photo of a landmark, etc.).

She has picked me up from the airport after work trips, and does not get out of the car to greet me, give me a hug or kiss, etc.  Often times, she is more worried about getting out of the way for others and will pat my knee, tell me she is glad I am home, but that is about it.  That night, she'll go to bed without giving intimacy a second thought (unless I ask).

However, if I am leaving for a trip, she will make a concerted effort to follow me around the house to be in the same room as I am and ""be with me"" before I leave.  Continuing, she will tell me she thinks I am handsome, that she is proud of me, will compliment me, and makes it a point to not speak ill of me to anyone else.

Our intimate life has regressed.  If I ask for intimacy, she will oblige most of the time.  She will get up, go to the bathroom, come back, take her clothes off, and sometimes offer 10-15 seconds of foreplay (by her to me).  At this point, I am not allowed to engage in foreplay as she will shrug me off and want me to get right to it.  It always feels like we are on a shot clock.  If I try, she'll make up some excuse (she hasn't shaved, the kids are still up or they'll be up soon, etc.).  During intercourse, she will move her hands up and down my back, shift her legs a little here and there, but she doesn't say anything and virtually never asks for or offers up any ideas or suggestions.  She very rarely tries to or wants to kiss, either.  If we start in missionary position, that's it.  If we start in doggy-style position, that's it.  If I ask her to change positions, she will do it, but everything always has to be my idea and initiated by me.

I can count on one hand the number of times she has surprised me with intimacy, and it was usually when she did something behind my back and needed my help to fix it or wanted something really bad.

Sidenote: She is not stimulated via vaginal intercourse alone.  I've tried to talk to her about this, tried to learn more about it, test hormone levels, etc. but she doesn't really care, to be honest.  She just accepts it as it is and that is that.  I've purchased different toys and tried to introduce them to help her be ""more involved,"" but she doesn't show any real interest.  Earlier in our relationship when I was allowed to engage in foreplay (by me to her), she would climax, then we would have intercourse and it was a little more fun.  It felt much more intimate, personal, and we had a little more connection.  In the moment, she has always enjoyed it, but she has shared that she doesn't really think about it and doesn't really desire it at all.

Since having children, I know she is self-conscious about her body (stretch marks, saggy skin, etc.), and has mentioned not being as ""tight"" as she used to be.  I try to reassure her, but it doesn't change anything.  At the same time, she makes no effort to change her diet, exercise, or see a doctor and discuss possible issues, fixes, etc.  She is not overweight, but she has very little lean muscle mass due to never really working out or trying to take care of herself in a serious, consistent way.

I plan trips for the whole family as well as for us a couple.  For couple trips, she behaves the same way she did on our honeymoon.  We will go out to eat, we will come back to the hotel, she will turn on the television, lay on the bed, get tired, and fall asleep.  If I ask for intimacy, she will oblige.  I have to pack the condoms, the lube, etc. (she doesn't want to get pregnant again and doesn't want to take birth control).  If I do not ask or mention it, she will act as if everything is great and absolutely nothing is wrong with not touching each other (beyond a hug here or there), kissing, being intimate, etc.

Our 20-year anniversary came and went this year.  I did not plan anything for it, because I wanted to see if she would bring it up or make any efforts to plan something on her own.  She did not.

The idea of breaking up a family and a 25-year relationship is not something I take lightly.  I am a person of faith and struggle with not honoring the vows I made (for better or worse, until death do us part, etc.).  I've discussed counseling and/or therapy, but she dismisses it, ""it will just cost us money and won't help.""

If I make this decision, I end up most likely losing up to 50% of my time with my children and possibly paying her alimony and child support, because she has basically refused to get even a part-time job to help out with increased expenses.  NOTE: If she at least honored her stay-at-home commitments, it would be easier to swallow, but she doesn't on a consistent basis and when we've faced a few financial hardships, she hasn't stepped up and offered to help (even for a short period of time).

We do not yell, we do not argue angrily, and there is no violence or infidelity.  Her go-to is to basically disengage, avoid, and pretend like everything is fine.  She does small but kind things, is relatively agreeable, and we align on most things from a faith and political perspective.  At the same time, I do not feel like I can have an intellectually stimulating conversation with her, because she doesn't really want to be a deep-thinker and will often ask me about such matters.

This has been a mental, physical, and emotional rollercoaster!  
  
If I stay, I have very little faith that she will make a sincere and concerted effort to meet me even 40% of the way.  I will need to carry the weight of the relationship and the family we created the entire time.

If I choose to leave, then:

1) I could find and enjoy a female partner who initiates and enjoys physical touch, is willing to have intellectual and deep conversations and challenge each other, is willing to do hard things, will step up and carry some of the weight during challenging times, and who would wholeheartedly accept five children who are not her own.

2) I could fail to find the above, possibly lose up 50% of my time with my children, pay alimony and possibly child support, and be even worse off than I am now (I'm not interested in casual sex or one night stands).  
  
In this day and age, is the devil you know better than the devil you don't???  If you've been in this position and made a decision one way or the other, would you mind sharing what you've learned through your experience and if/what you would change if you could?

tl;dr - With five children (ages 4 up to 18) in mind, is it better to stay in a less-than-ideal (lack of real partnership and intimacy) marriage versus moving on and holding out hope for something better in this day and age?",1,1760900217.0,marriageadvice,0,1.0,False
1oaxusj,https://i.redd.it/lqu2utne84wf1.png,What the Hell is... Quantum Physics?,"**Quantum physics isn’t just a collection of equations; it’s the universe’s secret language, whispering truths about existence that are both mind-boggling and awe-inspiring.**

As you delve into this classical beginner’s guide to Quantum Theory, remember that these rules, while inherently related to the quantum realm, can feel nonintuitive. They form the bedrock of particle physics, and if you struggle with some of these concepts, you're not alone. Even the legendary physicist Richard Feynman famously said, “If you think you understand quantum theory, you don’t.” So, let’s take this journey together into the bizarre and wonderful world of quantum mechanics.

# The Quantum Basics

1. **Wave-Particle Duality** Picture light as a multitasking actor playing different roles depending on the situation. Sometimes it behaves like a tiny bullet of energy (a photon), and other times, it acts like a spread-out ripple, much like ocean waves. This isn’t a glitch in the matrix—it’s simply how nature functions at the smallest scales. So, when you flick on a light switch, you’re not just illuminating a room; you’re engaging with a fundamental aspect of reality.
2. **Uncertainty Principle** Here’s where it gets a bit tricky. You can’t know everything about a particle at once. It’s like trying to photograph a hummingbird in mid-flight. If you focus on its position, you lose track of its speed. Conversely, if you try to pinpoint its speed, its location becomes a blur. This is Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle: the more you pin down one detail, the fuzzier the other becomes. It’s nature’s way of keeping some secrets close to its chest.
3. **Quantum Entanglement** Now, imagine two particles that are essentially “soulmates,” connected across vast distances—like cosmic pen pals. When you change one particle, the other reacts instantaneously, even if they’re separated by billions of miles. Einstein famously despised this “spooky action at a distance,” but experiments confirm it’s real. It’s as if the universe has a secret communication system that defies our everyday understanding of distance and time.
4. **The Observer Effect** Here’s a fun twist: particles behave differently when they’re being watched. It’s not just shyness; it’s math! Until you measure a particle, it exists in all possible states at once, much like a spinning coin in the air. Your observation “freezes” it into one outcome. So, in some ways, you’re not just a bystander in this cosmic play; you’re an active participant shaping reality.

# Mind-Bending Implications

**Schrödinger’s Cat (Simplified)** Let’s take a moment for a thought experiment that’ll blow your mind. Imagine a cat in a box with a poison trigger tied to a radioactive atom. Until you peek inside, the atom is both decayed and intact—so the cat is simultaneously alive and dead. It’s a wild concept, but it highlights how reality “chooses” its state only when observed.

**Time, Relativity, and You** Enter Einstein, who gave us mind-bending revelations:

* Time slows down if you’re moving really fast—like when you’re zooming near the speed of light.
* And remember E=mc²? It tells us that mass and energy are interchangeable, explaining everything from nuclear power to why you can’t outrun light. It’s a reminder that our intuitive understandings of time and space are just the tip of the iceberg.

# Why the Universe Isn’t “Common Sense”

Let’s face it: the universe doesn’t always play by our rules.

* **Entropy**: This is the idea that the universe is slowly falling apart—like your coffee cooling down or stars burning out. It proves that everything has a beginning, initiated by the Big Bang.
* **Before the Big Bang?** Time didn’t exist. Asking “what came before” is like asking “what’s north of the North Pole.” Mind-bending, right?

# Science vs. Spirituality?

Now, here’s where it gets even deeper. Quantum physics doesn’t disprove God; rather, it deepens the mystery of existence. Paul Davies argues that the universe’s laws are too intricate to be mere accidents. Whether you lean toward spirituality or science, quantum theory forces us to ask:

* Is reality just a complex math equation?
* Does consciousness shape what we perceive?

Einstein’s version of God wasn’t a bearded figure in the clouds; it was the “mind” behind the elegance of nature.

# Why This Matters to You

Quantum physics isn’t just confined to labs and textbooks; it has real-world applications that affect our daily lives:

* It gave us lasers, smartphones, and MRI machines—technology we often take for granted.
* It explains why the sun shines through nuclear fusion and how our eyes perceive light.

Yet perhaps the biggest lesson it teaches us is humility. The universe is weirder, wilder, and more wondrous than we ever imagined.

# The Takeaway

You don’t need a PhD to appreciate the quirkiness of quantum mechanics. The next time you gaze up at Orion’s Belt or plug in your phone, remember that beneath all of it lies a realm where particles teleport, time bends, and “impossible” is just another equation waiting to be solved.

As Paul Davies says, the universe isn’t a puzzle to solve; it’s a story to explore. And you, my friend, are a vital part of that story.",1,1760900217.0,WRXingaround,0,1.0,False
1oaxuhk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oaxuhk,Stillman Sofa,"8’ Performance basketweave, Flax

I’ve had a lot of requests for pictures of the Flax color so thought I’d make a post.  Ordered end of December 2024, delivered early February 2025.  In a north-facing room with windows on north side only, so limited natural light.  I keep lower half of windows covered to keep my dogs off the windowsills.  

Wall color is BM Swiss Coffee.  Pillows on each end in 2nd are from Quince as well.  I did have a hard time picking pillow color that I liked.  I carried the swatch around with me to many stores and gave the Quince ones a try as color was unique.  

I’m happy with the sofa, it’s not our primary in living room, but I find myself sitting here daily instead of living room.  I love how deep it is, it’s holding up really well with no signs of wear (even with 2 dogs that get on it occasionally.  

I was so nervous to order a couch without trying it first, but the price convinced me to go for it.  Glad I did, would definitely repurchase!  
Hope this is helpful for anyone considering and/or questioning the Flax color.

1oaxsia,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1oaxsia/as_a_single_woman_should_i_start_considering/,As a Single Woman: Should I Start Considering Larger Parameters?,"I was in a conference yesterday, and an hour of it was presented by a U.S. Marine Corp leader.

Leadership requires humility. Leadership requires sacrifice.

""If my men sleep there, I sleep there; if they are going hungry, I'm going hungry"" mentality.

Boldness. Bravery. Productivity. Honor. Valor. Honesty.

I already know of one friend from childhood who who grew up ""prayer movement"" and married a (semi?) Catholic (he grew up RC, but they sort of met somewhere in the middle by the time their wedding rolled around after knowing each other for many years). During the first year of marriage, she told me, ""He's good to me."" I know of so many evangelical / prayer movement couples that represent the reasons why organizations like ""To Love, Honor, and Vacuum"" exist (that a concerning amount of men desire or even expect a virgin, and then want her to act like a pro you-know-what worker as soon as the honeymoon comes, and then want that dynamic plentiful and perfect (""not a dead bedroom"") for the rest of the marriage. 

I was engaged (briefly) once, and was horrified to find out that my then-fiance (evangelical, and someone who had been ""working on himself"" for a long time to overcome a long-term porn addiction), despite our pre-marital counseling covering the very real possibility of having different moral standards about sexuality and the need to honor the person who had the higher standards (to honor and protect conscience and person, as that is an expression of love itself, as long as there is intimacy in the marriage), started to communicate marital expectations I was not okay with. He did not seem interest in honoring my boundaries either. 

Again, he had a strong history of porn; and it eventually seemed that he was still using it (but just hiding it) during our engagement period. There were points, also, at which I did not feel fully valued by him as a person, as an individual, as a soul, and even as someone who had waited (faithfully) for marriage, and had been (and am) very careful in areas emotional, physical, etc. when dating. More or less, and especially after the engagement ended, I felt like perhaps I had been seen as a means to an end.

After hearing this guy yesterday and then thinking about many of the single men I know of in church circles who others try to tell me are ""a catch"", it's pretty hard to see them that way. 

For example, I know of one guy has been dating a girl for going on 3 years; it's just not going anywhere at this point (multiple reasons); he has even indicated that he doesn't think it's going to work out; yet he won't break it off with cleanness and finality, and it seems partly because he would have to make some life changes to accommodate the shift. (Read: temporary discomfort.)

Meanwhile, Captain Marine is talking about how he has men who trust him enough to follow him on a suicide mission (meaning, he would lead it; he's not afraid to die, despite having a lot to live for). He also shared that niceness is when someone avoids saying the hard things; like, ""Hey, you have spinach in your teeth,"" and also that kindness is when someone does stop to say, ""Hey, you have spinach in your teeth.""

I am just having a really hard time at the moment realistically justifying trying to keep searching for a husband in the evangelical/prayer movement/non-denominational areas, where men (\*not all, but enough to make it important\*) seem to--and I've heard some even express--wanting the assurance of a ""yes"" from a girl before they will so much as ask her to meet for coffee; in my mind, that means desiring a predictable, safe script in their hands, which means no risk, no bravery, no initiative, no sacrifice, and no leadership. 

Also, the conference speaker, in his 30s I think, was one class away from his 4th master's degree and starting his own business (on top of military duties). And then I think back to all the single guys I know who sit at home and play video games (or hold very strongly to watching films or using other forms of entertainment that do not truly honor the Lord, seriously objectify women, etc.) . . . it's really, well, \*difficult\* to look at that now and think the latter \*really\* represents godly masculinity.

I know this post is not going to be the most well-received by men passing by on the forum (in which case, I'd simply ask my fellow Redditors to abide by the ""if the shoe fits, wear it; and if doesn't, great"" approach; it's a discussion based on experiences, not an accusation; and I have seen some seemingly great guys post intros on here, so please don't take this the wrong way). 

At the same time, \*for the sake of discussion\*---should I be expanding my parameters? Is hoping for a husband in the circles I've been looking in for 10+ years without success a statistically losing cause? Should I be willing to consider someone who is active service (was always opposed to that previously, because I didn't want to be separated from my spouse for long periods; but maybe that's better than not having a spouse at all), or has more of a Catholic/Anglican (i.e., high church) background (as long as we can be on the same page about not praying to saints, being open to the presence of the Holy Spirit, etc.), even though I am very cautious about beliefs that could come with that background?

If you have experiences in going beyond the normal parameters (breaking past the more or less non-denominational or more traditional denominations), did it work for you? Has it gone well? Was it any better than some of the negative cycles we seem to continue experiencing if we ""stay in our lane""?

I made this account just to post this question, and specifically chose this subreddit because I'm a big fan and I love the advice shaaba and Jamie give. And I am hoping their fans will be kind and understanding of my predicament.
Anyway!
WIBTA/D if I tried to stop someone from my past getting a job?
Some background:
When I was a kid I became friends with this boy, we will call him Will, who was the son of my parents friends. We got on well enough. But when we hit our teenage years, he changed. I don't want to go into details (even my best friend doesn't know the full story), but he treated my very poorly, took advantage of me, and did some very horrible things to me. Eventually I had had enough and cut him out of my life completely. I've had nothing to do with him since.
Anyway, my parents are still friendly with his parents and they meet up or chat on the phone sometimes (when they visit I have to leave, because the father also makes me incredibly uncomfortable, always has. Even though he has never done anything to me).
So today my mum starts telling me what Will has been up to. And apparently he's looking at getting a job in a restaurant that is directly beside the coffee shop where I work. He worked for another branch of the same restaurant in another city a few years ago, which generally gives people a better shot at being rehired, assuming they weren't completely incompetent, because companies want people who already know the job.
So now I am completely riddled with anxiety about the possibility of seeing him. Of him coming into my work, as a lot of their staff do.
I know my coworkers would have my back, if I say to them 'this guy is a problem', they will know to let me hide in the back or do some non-customer facing task so I don't have to deal with him. But let's face it, that's not a long term solution.
My friend suggested the possibility of writing to the restaurant anonymously, saying that I knew Will was planning on applying for a job there, and I was uncomfortable even working in the same vicinity as him.
But to me this seems really mean and vindictive.
I haven't seen this guy in 15 years. It's literally been sooooo long. He could be completely different. (Though this doesn't change what he did in the past). I feel like ruining a job prospect is just too much. But I also don't know that I can cope with the anxiety. I'm already severely depressed, with many, many medical issues. I don't need this too.
So please, any advice you can give, let me know. I don't want to write that letter, but if it's the only thing I can do to keep him away...I don't know. I'm truly lost.

Edit: my dad suggested that, if he did get the job, I go to the manager of the restaurant then and just say that Will specifically isn't welcome in our shop. I don't know if this is a better idea, as at least it wouldn't result in him risking losing out on the job.",1,1760899941.0,1800Drama,3,1.0,False

Being depressed about it is.,"I have been dealing with heavy body image issues for the past two years, ever since I decided to end my previous unhappy relationship. A few months later, I decided to download dating apps — at that point, I thought I was ready. I came up with (what I thought was) a very funny bio, added some (what I thought were) nice travel shots, and thought it was my time to shine.

The reality of it was painful. I received maybe two to five likes across four major dating apps. That was heartbreaking. I didn’t know what to do, so I turned for help to… Reddit. Never do that. That crushed my self-esteem even more.

Well, honestly, there *was* some good advice I implemented — like getting a better haircut, using hair products, smiling more in pictures, and getting new glasses or contacts. I appreciate the users for that. But after two years of all that — hitting the gym, growing out my beard, and generally looking and feeling better (my friends all tell me so, so it’s not an illusion) — my attempts with the apps still failed miserably. The results were slightly better, but still nothing to be proud of.

And while these two years brought really positive changes to the way I look, I also spent them in depression and obsessed with my appearance. I thought there was something I could do, some trick that would finally work — that I’d start getting matches with beautiful girls and finally experience dating. But every time, the harsh reality hit me, and I felt a lot of pain.

I spent four to six hours a DAY taking selfies, looking in the mirror, thinking “Oh, my face is not too bad,” or “Damn, I’m so ugly.” I would see attractive men on the streets or in Instagram reels and just feel pain, thinking about how easy it must be for them to get attention, and how I’d never be like them no matter what I did. I was even ashamed of these thoughts, so I didn’t talk to people about them.

It finally happened this spring — I started to open up to my friends and in therapy, and slowly the pain began to be replaced by sadness. I didn’t feel pain anymore, just sadness that I wasn’t getting the dating experience I thought I should be having.

And finally, a few weeks ago, I was on holiday in Spain, and I saw my worst nightmare there: so many absolutely gorgeous-looking guys. I realized — yes, there really are a lot of men that are a lot more attractive than me. That’s reality. I can’t do anything about it. I’m neither tall nor particularly handsome, and I’ll never be like that. But spending hours of my precious life crying over it and obsessing about it while I could just be enjoying my holiday — that’s a choice.

Guys, feminism tells women they can live happily without men. So why can’t a man live happily without women? There’s so much to do in this life that doesn’t involve women or intimacy — from morning coffee and laughing with friends to enjoying your hobbies, pursuing your career, traveling the world, going to gigs, and just freaking enjoying life.

Of course, it’s sad when something others can easily experience is much harder for you — but being obsessed with it and feeling worse because of it is still your choice. And you know what? Not a single one of my friends has ever told me I’m worth less because of how I feel or because of my dating situation. They still see me as a great friend, a funny guy, someone who bravely speaks about his feelings, and someone they can learn from. And I’m proud of that.

You can still enjoy life. It’s worth living. There’s simply no other choice. And if you find yourself in a situation like I was, please believe me — life is good. Enjoy it, and control what you can. I love you, and I’m proud of you.",0,1760899834.0,malementalhealth,2,0.4,False

1oaximd,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oaximd/meteor_desert_pt1/,Meteor Desert Pt1,"The sun beat down viciously, as if it could burn us into the ground through the sheer weight of its heat.

The hike into the research area came short of my expectations, the scenery was quite short of beautiful, and my stomach was very short of being full. All of these gripes were exacerbated by the shortest aspect of them all: my temper, which was whittled down each time he looked over his shoulder and gave me that goddam smirk.

The obliviously good spirits he kept had the inverse effect of their intention on me. Every time we stopped to rest, he would make sure I drank enough water or would offer his pocket knife to scrape cactus and tree thorns out of my ankles and forearms. He would hold tree branches while I walked past them so that they didn’t smack me as he pushed through them, he would offer up fun facts about the local flora as we walked past them. Things that are objectively kind and charming, and I’ll even admit that in another circumstance I would have seen them as such. However, he is the reason I am in the desert feeling torrents of salty sweat pour into a million tiny cuts and jabs across my body on the promise of something that *may* (or may not) be “interesting”.

I’ve known Cooper since college, and I know the kinds of things he finds interesting can vary from simply base to excruciatingly specific bordering on trivial. Regardless of where on this spectrum his interest falls, his intoxicating enthusiasm can almost trick you into finding it interesting too.  This is the chief pitfall for how I am on mile 8 of a god-knows-how-long hike in the desert, on the gamble that I will not only find what Cooper has found interesting, but that I will also deem it worthwhile.

It didn’t help that he warned me there is a very strong chance things would be dangerous. Cooper’s enthusiasm brought about a lot of hyperboles in his past exploits, but he knows when to cut the bullshit. To be fair, he seemed to be skeptical of the dangers himself, which amounted to strange noises at night, the feeling of being watched, and occasionally misplacing things and finding them in odd or unreasonable places. Things that could be seen as commonplace or a whole lot of nothing, but the fact that Cooper is tense enough to consider these important enough to warn me about was just as convincing as if they were real.

Whatever I was walking towards has Cooper worked up, and I have nothing but his word and his character as my justification to be a part of it.

None of that could save him from how cranky I was, of course. Each time he cracked a joke or smiled, I debated cracking him over the head with a rock. I settled for out-of-breath glares and pointedly ignoring him. He dared be jolly while I was dying of dehydration and the realization of just how isolated we were creeping up on me. That deserved at least a punch.

Our hike was more of a trek, as Cooper decided his research area needed to be as remote as possible to get as reliable of data as possible. This meant crossing canyons and creeks, walking along ridgelines, and at one point crossing a rickety suspension bridge hanging over a gorge. Saguaros stood watch as we passed, being scratched by the acacias and stabbed by the cholla. Closer and closer to the mountains we got, looming above the desert like condescending giants. Finally, as we stood over a ridge, Cooper pointed down at a little building nestled into the mouth of a canyon. A small creek snaked out of the canyon and passed the house.

“There’s home for the summer,” he said, a tired smirk on his face.

“Fucking finally,” I gasped.

We crawled down the side of the canyon, picking our way through cliffs and rocks into the substantially cooler environs offered by the canyon and its creek. As we approached the home, I see that it was an old homestead, likely abandoned by a miner at some point. Cooper had fixed it up pretty good, having installed a vegetable garden and solar panels. The whole property was shaded by massive walnut trees that towered over us, a sign to Cooper the Ecologist that this riparian system has been stable for a very long time. The homestead itself was still there, if you also believed the ship of Theseus was the same ship even though it was now a battleship.

 Cooper had added on to it over his stay, converting what must have been little more than a shack into a sprawling, two story home, with rooms added onto it as he saw fit, turning a miner’s shack into an odd amalgamation of what Cooper considered a home. The original homestead was still more or less there, and in fact it looked like Cooper took pains to make sure that the spirit of it was kept, despite a replaced board here and there. However, the shack was little more than a foyer to the home built around it. The second floor was little more than a single room capped by a tile roof (probably where Cooper slept) and the rest of the space dominated by a balcony shaded by the solar panels and flower pots.

As we crossed the planks that served as a bridge across the creek, Cooper said “Well, I have something special to celebrate you coming to visit this summer.” And plunged his hand into the water to pull out a clear bottle.

“Local mezcal,” he said with a grin.

Without a word, I reached out a hand and he put the bottle in it. The cork made a satisfying pop as I pulled it off, and the refreshingly cool fire blazed down my throat as I took a sip.

“Good stuff,” I said, handing it back to Cooper and he took a swig himself.

“Yeah, it’s not bad,” he said. “Figured you’d appreciate the full desert experience again. Now let’s set the bags down and get you settled. Welcome to the Meteor Desert Research Station.”

The prospect of entering Cooper’s home excited me, not just as a weary desert traveler who felt simultaneously soaked in sweat and shriveled up like cracked clay, but also as a bit of a nosy freak. As an archeologist, I have built a career about making determinations off of people’s stuff. What kind of houses they built, the toys they made, the art they created, it all tells you so much about a particular individual and the culture they found themselves in. Like a detective profiling a killer by observing the crime scene, I attempt to build a profile of a civilization and culture based on what they leave behind. Or at least that’s what I tell myself.

I’ve dug through my parents’ drawers and snooped in people’s closets as a child so often, my parents feared I would become a kleptomaniac. It’s nothing malicious; I never stole and I would never pass judgement; it was that curiosity would itch in the back of my mind compulsively and my fingers would twitch to satiate. The thought of not knowing, and the sheer satisfaction of learning more about someone in some miniscule tiny way, got me quite the reputation as a nosy, creepy child. As an adult I learned to curb my habit, but I admit I still poke around in a medicine cabinet or two.

We walked past the courtyard and gardens and into the coolness of the Station, which I soon found to be dominated by not just more plants, but also books, field equipment, antlers, animal skulls (some even mounted), a couple rifles, a bow, and a PC set up that looked like it could power the moon landing. While the sheer amount of stuff first alludes to the overwhelming concept of clutter, this was not so. Bookcases and shelves were the background heroes, restraining the chaotic menagerie into something more akin to museum exhibits. Much of the bookcases, shelves, and furniture was hand-made, and likely by Cooper based on the minor but noticeable imperfections they tended to have. The plants were all healthy, the skulls were clean, and the books had crinkled covers and occasional packing-tape repairs.

Books: what a treasure trove of snooping. A solid collection of plant and animal identification books and multiple books about geology, mammalogy, botany, paleontology, really anything that could be looped into ecology, were to be expected from an ecologist as passionate as Cooper. However, this naturalist collection was dwarfed by the sheer number of sci-fi and fantasy books. Clearly Coop had plenty of time on his hands.

“Get enough of a fix for now, Snoopy?” Cooper teased as I scanned his bookcases, my loaded backpack still on my back. “We are only in the living room, and I would like to give you the breakdown before dark.”

“Yeah, I guess,” I said, slightly perturbed on being called out. Cooper knew of my quirk, since the time he caught me drunkenly digging through his pantry during college.

“If I had to guess,” I began, turning my voice into one of a nasally academic. I always felt people responded better to my analyses if I put on a funny, mocking voice as I did it. “I’d say your use of bookcases show a growing discipline, containing your passion and encouraging it at the same time.”

Cooper made a buzzer sound. “Wrong, I just think my stuff looks better this way,” a truly shit-eating grin on his face as he placed a pair of mason jars on the coffee table between us and poured more mezcal into them.

“Fucker,” I said, picking up my glass.

“Kiss your mother with that mouth?”

“No, I kiss yours with it.”

He raised his glass, and I clinked mine against it.

“So, you ready for the news?” he asked, looking over at me.

“I’ve been ready for a month now. You dangled a new site in front of me, told me nothing about it except that you’re afraid it might be dangerous, then insisted I get my life put together enough to live with you for four months in the middle of nowhere. I swear, Cooper, if this isn’t something worth all of that, I’m leaving your ass here and not speaking to you again.”

 “Relax, it’ll be worth it, I swear” he said, waving off my tirade. “I found a staircase in a cave.”

“A what?”

Cooper began rubbing his thumbs together as he spoke. “I was in a cave, trying to get some bat data, since they just migrated in. I got into the back of the cave and there was a staircase carved into the back of it. Creepiest shit I’ve ever seen.”

“Did you go in?”

“Of course. I thought it might be the homestead’s mine, and I was curious. So, I went down it and as I did, there were paintings and cave art along the sides. I didn’t recognize any of it, but I’m also not the archy. All I knew is that it certainly wasn’t a mine.

“I went down the staircase for what felt like five, maybe ten minutes? Like, not super long for a walk, but long enough that you start thinking ‘damn, this is a long staircase’, right?” Cooper’s eyes stared through the coffee table, his mind showing him something more clearly than his eyes.

“What’d you find at the bottom?” I asked, pushing him to get to the good part. The fact that he was not describing much of anything was only forgiven by the fact that he would take me there tomorrow.

“A chamber. Not really sure what else to call it, but it was about the size of a house. Big empty, stone chamber, and in the middle was a weird table. Maybe a pedestal? I’ll have you look at it, it was funky, but the point is that the table had nine lumps on it, and a mask sat on one of them.”

“A mask? Like what kind of mask?”

“Like a carved wooden mask. No decorations, nothing. Just eye holes, a mouth slit and a bump to fit on the nose.”

“I don’t think any Native Americans here made masks; they have to have been made by settlers.”

Cooper raised his hands in a don’t-shoot-the-messenger kind of way. “Hey, I just figured between the cave paintings and the masks, I needed an archeologist. And since it didn’t look like anything I’ve seen before, I figured I’d find one I would like to see on the front page as she discovers a new civilization. Picture it: Olivia Prince, the Discoverer of Unknown Desert Peoples.”

“Yeah, we’ll see about that,” I grumbled. The area was known to have cliff-dwelling communities in the native tribes. This already seemed like it could possibly be them and the masks may just be a prank by whoever was here before Cooper. Everyone wanted to find some unknown civilization, but reality was much crueler than that. “Did you touch anything?”

“Naw, you taught me better than that.”

“Any writing?”

“Some, carved on the table and along the passage down. Thought that was a little weird, didn’t realize any of the tribes had a written language.”

“Nope, not prior to European influence, unless we start talking about the Aztecs and Mayans.”

“Well,” he said, knocking back the rest of the mezcal in his glass. “Then I think we better get you in that cave tomorrow. It sounds like it’s going to be worth your time.”

“Hold on,” I paused, nervous to even ask the question. “Why do you think it might be dangerous?”

Cooper had been playing it cool talking about the cave, keeping his faux smile on, but now it fell entirely.

“Well, you know me, an active imagination and all that,” he said quietly. Outside, the sun blazed red as it began to set. “Since I’ve been in the cave, I’ve had some minor experiences. The stuff I told you about: strange sounds, feeling like I’m being watched, stuff moving around on me. And it’s one of those things, being out here in the wilderness you get those weird feelings every now and then, but you eventually shake it off.”

Cooper stood, leaning over and behind me to close the curtains of the window, then moved to the next window and closed the curtains on it too.

“But it hasn’t shaken,” he continued as he moved around, turning on lights. “I’ve spent my whole life in the desert, I know when something’s off.”

“Off how?” I asked.

Cooper paused for a second, the gears almost visibly turning in his head. He turned and sat back down. “You ever come across a mountain lion in the wild, Liv?”

I shook my head. I was hardly the outdoorsman Cooper was.

“Not surprising, I’ve only done it a handful of times. But the first time I did has stuck with me. I was walking along, bowhunting unsuccessfully and marching my way through a mesquite bosque. As I’m walking, I begin to feel uneasy, like I’m being watched. But I keep walking along, and the uneasiness kept building. I kept sniffing the air, straining my ears, swearing there was something that I was missing. I came across a wash, and without thinking, jumped right in to cross. Right in the middle was a perfect mountain lion footprint, the trail leading back into the bosque.

“As I stood there, looking at the footprint, the wind shifted. The smell of cat smashed into my face, and I turned to see the lion thirty yards away, up on the bank. Not stalking, just standing there, watching me curiously. Like it hasn’t ever seen something on two legs before, and was also wondering if I was worth eating. I pulled out my pistol and started yelling at it, and it trotted away. Not that it was in any hurry, or even felt threatened. Just moving along from the weird thing shouting at it.

“I walked back to the truck slowly, every sound I heard was the lion, and I had my gun in a death grip. The whole time, the only thing I could smell was cat.

“The worst part wasn’t that I saw the cat, or that I thought it was stalking me, it was what I realized about the smell. The smell didn’t come from nowhere, it *intensified.* I had smelled it all the way through the bosque, a small instinctive part of me had known that there was something wrong, but my brain couldn’t rationalize what it was. I had sensed there was a lion in the woods, but I couldn’t know until I was face to face with it.

“I’m smelling the lion in the woods, Liv.”

The air was stagnant between us, hanging on Cooper’s words. Outside, crickets began to chirp as the last light of the sun retreated from the canyon.

“Whelp!” he said, slapping his hands on his thighs and standing up. “No reason to get quite excited yet, and besides, it’s an occasion to celebrate.”

Cooper waved me off the couch and into the kitchen, where I sat on a stool behind a counter as Cooper started began to pull things from the fridge.

Cooper put on some music, and we chatted as he cooked. Cooper was a natural host, and between the sounds of his cooking, the music playing, and our mezcal-fueled laughter, we filled the night with a liveliness that felt much greater than that of just two people. Cooper would sing along to old country songs; I’d tease his horrible singing. We reminisced about college, and asked questions about our careers since. Despite the years that passed, and the changes that had been made to us, nothing had changed between my good friend and I.

Our bellies filled and the bottle empty, we wound down for the night. Cooper showed me to a guest room that was immaculate. As I settled in, my slow, fluid thoughts were filled of my friend constructing a guest room, furnishing it, and then keeping it nice and tidy for years, despite the fact that no one ever stayed in it.

As I was laying down, drifting off to sleep, I decided that no matter what was in that cave tomorrow, I made the right decision coming out here.

Silvery moonlight sprayed across my body, only interrupted by the shadows of the plant Cooper had in the window. Crickets chirped outside, and the coyotes yipped in the distance. My thoughts flowed like syrup as I lay in bed, thinking of how the coyotes reminded me of the camping trips Cooper and I would go on with our friends in college, how supposedly one could tell the temperature based on the rate crickets chirp, how the coyotes almost sounded like they were actually singing.

My eyes bolted open, hazy thoughts clearing in an instant as my ears strained to listen. The coyotes *were* singing. The initially discordant howls and yips in the distance slowly harmonized over the past few minutes, the canine voices chanting an energetic hymn that grew more frenzied as the moon rose. The volume pulsed with the rhythm, making their distance impossible to determine. Are they outside my window? Or on that distant hill?

I stood up, the unease being too much to handle alone, and I rose to leave my room. I stopped with my hand on the door handle. Was it my imagination, or was the handle slightly vibrating? What if I opened this door and the coyotes, if that’s what they are, are outside waiting? The thought of coyotes hunched outside my door, eyes glowing green and saliva dripping from their teeth, waiting for the slightest crack in the door to pounce and…

*Don’t be stupid,* I thought to myself. *Coyotes are pests, they aren’t manhunters. If Cooper finds out you were scared of coyotes, you’ll never hear the end of it.*

I forced the logic into my body and I turned the handle and stepped out into the hallway. As I crept through the house, my affirmations melted away, if they ever existed to begin with. The chanting echoed through the rooms, so much that I could almost believe a coyote was behind every closed door. At the base of the staircase leading to Cooper’s room I hesitated again. Only one way up and one way down. I shoved aside the thought, and walked up the stairs, the wooden railing cool as I marched step after step, the vulnerability on my back like a cool breeze.

Peeking into Cooper’s room, I found the sliding glass door to the balcony open, and my unease turned to ice in my body as the chants echoed through it, rattling through my bones.

“Cooper?” I asked sheepishly.

“I’m out here, Liv,” he called from the balcony.

Relieved, I walked outside, the cool desert air wrapping around me. The coyotes’ song echoed through the canyon, filling the air like rain in a storm. Cooper sat in a rocking chair illuminated by the moonlight, a rifle laying across his lap, his eyes scanning the desert around us. I pulled up a chair next to him, and pulling my knees up to my chest.

“I thought I was going crazy out here,” he said quietly, only a whisper above the coyotes. His eyes never seemed to rest in the moonlight, his thumb rubbing the wood stock of his rifle.

“Well, if you’re crazy, then so am I.” I didn’t know what else to say. Paranoia rocketed through me, jumping at the shadows in the distance. I could swear I saw things moving in the shrubs, some seeming to skirt around us, some creeping closer.

We sat outside and listened to the coyotes, until exhaustion from the day took over. I faded to sleep, the world fading away, leaving only the chanting of the desert.",1,1760899438.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False
1oaxi33,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCIS/comments/1oaxi33/ncis_s3e15_head_case_who_killed_who_and_why_does/,"NCIS S3E15 “Head Case” — Who killed who, and why does this episode make zero sense?","The episode opens with Gibbs’ team mid-sting on a car theft ring.  
At first, it seems legit — maybe the thieves are stealing military vehicles or targeting Navy personnel. Fair enough, must have missed the entire premise, ok, let's go with it is somehow NCIS territory.

Then — boom. A stolen Mercedes, trunk pops open, and there’s a cooler with a severed head inside.  
Only later do we find out the head belongs to a Navy Commander — meaning NCIS was technically in the right place at the right time, but for completely different reasons.

Still, the setup feels backwards: NCIS goes after car thieves, and accidentally finds a decapitated Navy officer in the process. Like… how?

This show loves to skip crucial exposition and hide major clues in random throwaway lines. By the time you realize what mattered, the episode’s wrapped and Gibbs is already sipping coffee in the elevator.  
(Also, yes, this is the same show that once had someone “running out of air in a car trunk.” Science is optional in NCIS-land.)

# The Big Questions

* Who actually killed Martin Broussard, the crematorium guy? “They” (Ross and Vernon, apparently) thought he’d crack under interrogation, so they killed him. But how? None of these people are remotely the “murder type.” We’ve got a funeral director, a medical examiner, a sketchy lawyer, and a crematorium operator — not exactly a hit squad.
* Why was Broussard delivering bodies to the chop shop in a Mercedes instead of the perfectly good mortuary van on site? Was that just for the cold-open shock value?
* Was Vernon, the funeral director, actually involved, or did Oliver just throw him under the bus to save herself?
* Why was a severed head in a car trunk at midnight instead of in the chop shop cooler with the rest of the body parts? Were heads being disposed of separately to hide the victims’ identities, or was that detail just… never explained?

# What I Think Happened (Please Correct Me if I’m Wrong)

Sean Oliver (the lawyer)

* The Mercedes (with the head) ties back to Epsilon Corp, her fake company.
* Epsilon owned the car, had offshore accounts, and leased the warehouse.
* She admits to trafficking body parts — basically the brains and banker of the whole thing.
* Claims “they killed Broussard” (Ross + Vernon) because he wouldn’t hold up under questioning.

Dr. Ross (the Navy medical examiner)

* The same guy who performed the official autopsy on the decapitated head also moonlights as the guy chopping up bodies at the warehouse. Sure, that tracks. Finishes his shift as a government ME, clocks out, and heads to his night job as a freelance organ harvester.
* Ducky notices he’s left-handed — same as the dissector.
* Ross admits to the trafficking ring but denies killing anyone.
* Also: MEs don’t “choose” funeral homes. Families do. Yet somehow Ross just funnels bodies to his favorite corrupt undertaker like it’s an in-network provider.

Martin Broussard (the cremation furnace operator)

* Works for Vernon, lives in a shed, yet inexplicably drives a shiny Mercedes that promptly gets stolen.
* “Just the delivery guy,” according to Oliver.
* Ends up dead and dismembered like the others — supposedly killed by his own partners to keep him quiet.

Vernon (the funeral director)

* Allegedly “supplied” the bodies meant for cremation.
* There’s no proof, no confession — he seems genuinely clueless until Oliver blames him.
* Presumably he is the one who faked the cremations, the cremation paperwork?

# How the Operation (Apparently) Worked?

1. Oliver creates a fake company, leases the warehouse, and handles the money.
2. Ross identifies cadavers from Navy autopsies — then moonlights at the chop shop carving them up again.
3. Vernon fakes cremation and  paperwork to reroute the bodies.
4. Broussard drives them to the warehouse — in a Mercedes, because mortuary vans aren’t prime-time enough.
5. Ross dismembers the bodies.
6. Oliver sells the parts.
7. Then, allegedly, Ross and/or Vernon kill Broussard when he becomes a liability. How? Who knows. The show doesn’t even try.

Anyway — love this show, but this episode is a **total logic pretzel.**  
If anyone can actually diagram who did what, please help, because Google and AI summaries have *nothing* on this fever dream of an episode.",0,1760899401.0,NCIS,1,0.33,False

it’s weird because i didn’t even love every second of it. some of it made me cringe, some storylines annoyed me to no end, sometimes i wanted to shake half the characters. but still. for the last month or two, it’s been this constant thing that's always playing somewhere in the background. i’d put it on while studying or eating or cleaning or just zoning out and suddenly everything felt a bit softer. it gave me that small town coffee in hand feeling, yk? like i could wind down from my exhausting day.

And now it’s gone. and i feel weirdly empty. like i lost something that was never even real but had quietly become part of my day. i keep catching myself wanting to play just one more episode, like there’s still something left to see, but there isn’t. and no matter how much i try to fill that silence, it doesn’t feel the same.

it’s crazy how attached you can get to the feeling of something rather than the story itself. like the rhythm of the dialogue, the coziness of the sets, that small bubble of stars hollow where people care about town meetings and random festivals. it’s like i’d found this little corner of the world to escape into and now i’ve been kicked out.

i don’t think i’m even sad exactly, just… empty. like when you come home after a long trip and everything’s exactly where you left it but you’re not the same anymore. i keep thinking maybe i’ll start another show, but i know i’m just chasing that same kind of comfort and nothing else quite hits it.

anyway this is a long pointless ramble but i needed to put it somewhere. maybe it’s just that i really liked having something warm to come back to every night and now there’s this tiny space that feels colder.",26,1760899391.0,GilmoreGirls,4,0.97,False

I found a recipe for brown sugar marshmallows with a dark chocolate swirl and then I swapped out some of water for bourbon for an extra little treat. Making them was easy enough until it came time to move the fluff from the mixing bowl to the prepared baking dish. The kitchen and I were covered in mallow’y cobwebs by the time I was finished. 

Hot chocolate is always good, but I’m a true coffee fiend. My post-run snack today was a cup of coffee with a little bit of heavy cream and one the marshmallows.

I mostly use the travel mug for water while working at home, and now I've been using a lot this travel bottle on weekends when I woke up early to do shebanigangs. And it is great.

The larger 36oz rambler I only use this for outdoors (water or coffee). And the Colster is great too. Keep the beer cold when doing work in my garage.

I think the travel bottle is perfect. It is lightweight, easier tondrink than the travel mug and I don't need to have a lot of water/coffee when driving mid or short distances from 1-2 hours.

I wouldn’t say I’m a true IBS candidate as I have no pain and go 1x a day in the morning however the consistency is always like a Bristol 5, sometimes a 4 and sometimes a 6 with urgency. 

This morning, 30mins after eating (home made breakfast sandwich - eggs, sweet potato fries, avocado, jack cheese, bagel, side of chicken apple sausage) and 36hrs after my last meal I had to urgently use the restroom. FWIW, I also had my usual cup of cold brew with creamer.

Curious if this is just the creamer and coffee talking or having this semi big meal after not consuming anything for 36hrs is what caused such an urgent gastro reflex. I rarely ever have that. It was definitely along the Bristol 6 chart. It’s been 4-5hrs since. My hypochondria and anxiety kicks in and immediately wonders about eating something bad, SIBO/ibs, IBD, etc. however I’ve had extensive labs done and over the years nothing has been out of range-even Calprotectin.

Appearance: Cis Black woman who is STEM presenting (not really into labeling but the most accurate description). Average height and weight with curves. I’m getting back into being more active and consistently in the gym, but I’ve always been told I have an athletic build since I’ve played sports most of my life. Curly hair I wear in mini twists most of the time with plans to get microlocs soon.

Quick Intro: *Please note I’m a late bloomer and this will be my first romantic relationship with another woman. I know it’s not for everyone so want to make my experience level very clear * I’m a driven and determined person who still remains a dreamer and optimist. Post-grad, I traded scrubs for spreadsheets, but on a mission to work towards a PhD and build a career in public health policy. Outside of work I love spending time in nature via trail walks. I find that time very healing and one of the few moments my mind slows down. Avid reader and still aiming to hit my 100 book goal for the year. One of my favorite books so far this year was The Women by Kristin Hannah. When I can, I enjoy playing tennis, building Legos, and thrifting/adding to my growing physical media library. I enjoy a wide range of music, books, art (museums are a happy place for me), and movies/shows. This is not comprehensive but should give a decent overview. I’ve only ever been in long-term monogamous relationships and that’s a comfort zone for me.

Seeking: Someone who is confident and kind-hearted, but isn’t afraid of being comfortable and silly. A conversationalist who is curious and also a great teacher. I love learning new things, so please tell me about your passions and what keeps you up at night! Emotionally mature and understands the give and take of relationships. Doesn’t mind starting off as friends with benefits while we get to know each other, but isn’t scared of things getting more serious at any point.

Possible dealbreakers: I don’t drink (don’t mind social drinking), smoke, or do any sort of recreational drugs. I strongly value honesty, transparency, and open communication. I know trust takes time to build but making sure it’s there within the context of the situation is very important to me. I’m not perfect so not expecting you to be, but having a measure of self-awareness and willingness to grow as an individual is foundational and very attractive to me.

If this sounds like your cup of tea, please send me a DM! I’d love to chat and set up time for a coffee/tea/match/boba date and see where things go ☺️.",1,1760898977.0,lesbianr4r,0,1.0,False
1oaxalg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1oaxalg/aitah_for_refusing_to_take_my_ex_back/,Aitah for refusing to take my ex back?,"Long story long. 
  For context,I met this man at a coffee shop and we both turned out to be regulars there. He's seen me in scrubs (I'm a cna) and he probably assumed I was maybe a nurse or something.  He was always on his laptop most of the times and he mentioned he works remotely. We didn't discuss anything like how much we make or what exactly we do for work. Later realized we stay few blocks away. We both were renting 1 bedroom apartments. We started going out and all and later he asked me to be his girlfriend and I said yes. 
    Fast forward almost an year later, a relative of mine mentioned wanting to sell her house (4 bedroom) because she moved states and settled there.  It's  a good house and immediately felt like I want to own that house. I know it well and the location is just good. I told this guy ""Alex"" about it. We had already planned moving in together come jan anyway. 

  How did I phrase it? I said we could buy that house, we both put equal down payments, the amount we both pay rent continues to pay mortgage (1300 each) and we can both have our names on the house. I made it pretty clear that both our name be on the deed since we'll both have contributed equal amounts. If we ever end up getting married then we'll and good we have a home, if we ever break up we can sell it and take 50:50. 

  Where did the problem start?  He said I probably make more cash as a nurse and maybe I can give 70% down-payment and he 30 since we are a team after all. That's when I corrected him, told him I'm not a nurse, I'm a cna. (NEVER once did i ever say i am a nurse. Just what he assumed). 
This man got so mad and said I'm just a gold digger who wants a free ride to own a home when I make a minimum wage!! He said he makes a decent amount and needs a woman who can match that, not a leech!! He said he brings home 78k per year and the least he can go is if a woman makes atleast 50k py. I asked him what happened to ""we are a team after all"" and he didn't respond to that. I was done with him instantly!! I refuse to stay with someone who respects people based on how much is their worth. That was the end of our relationship.  

 Now, I anyway got the house. Paid 60k dp and now on mortgage.  It's a 4b so I was looking for a roommate. And Alex's friend ""john"" thought it was a good idea. He said he pays 1300 for an apartment so he can pay the same for 2 bedrooms,  I agreed. John told Alex he's moving in with a roommate but I guess he didn't mention that I was the said roommate.  Later Alex told John he wants to see where he moved and John brought him home. We all can predict what happened,  Alex told john that he can't do that, john said it's a good idea and he gets even more room. Alex said that I may look like a nice person but I make bare minimum and I might drain him with my expenses.  That's when john asked why is that since I make more than what he makes. They both work in the same field so they make almost the same. Alex said it's lies. John told him I make about 98k py and Alex lost it. He said I deceived him and I lied to him. He said I am a manipulative bitch and all the curse words you can think about.  Alex stayed anyway and told him he is rethinking their friendship since he's so ashamed that his friend respects people based on their worth. 

  About 3 weeks ago I received a call from an unknown person, turns out it was Alex's mother. She said that people makes mistakes and I should take her son back. That I am stressing him and he's not doing well. She started preaching to me about forgiveness and I blocked her number. Even his sister called to say the same. I blocked her too. 

Now this man is telling people I lied to him. And I probably was cheating on him with his ex friend. 
Was I the asshole for not taking him back?

I’m curious if I have categorized or budgeted wrong, if anybody can double check how I have my layout, I’d appreciate it. 

I have car insurance (which only comes out every 6 months) & renters insurance (which only comes out once a year) under fixed bills because even though it doesn’t charge monthly, I put the money for each aside in a separate account so when the bill comes out I have all the money. So I’m curious is that the correct way to categorize that or does that mess up my monthly budgeting page because this month car insurance got taken out and it looks like I’m negative in the budget since it all came out at once? 

Also, I wanted to ask about these savings sinking funds. I have them on rollover cause a video said to do so but I feel it doesn’t make sense. I put money in another account for subscriptions and tolls each month to budget for them all but I just don’t know if the categorization makes sense. Maybe I should just put parking and such in fixed bills or something and get rid of sinking funds. Also I have a separate account for emergency fund which I save for monthly and I feel like since I have that account the medical and home improvement is redundant. 

I don’t care that my numbers are on here.

My father worked very hard to get to his current position and thanks to his hardwork, our family is very well off. I am able to study in very good university and we own decent properties. From outside we may look sweet and happy but I am truly disgusted of my father.
In 2020,16 Feb my father hit my mother and was going to hit more but I jumped in to stop it. And whenever I think about that day it still shakes me. I was just 15 and I was fully focusing on my board. These type of things used to happen when I was little but I am just a fucking coward and failure like I would hear my mother's scream but the presence of my father made me freeze. So after that 16 Feb, they didn't speak to each other for 1 months and during that time I used to study for my 10th board and also keep a watch on my mother who was sleeping next to me. I used to lock the room when I slept so that nothing happens when I sleep and I couldn't cry ot scream cause I had to be a support for my emotional mother and sister so I just stood with my emotions hidden. Then after that they used to fight but father never tried to hit her again. But he started passing verbal abuses like dog, bitch, slur at my mother and mother ignored just for my sister. 
In 2022 I came to my university which is far away from my hometown. So I used to be in constant fear about my mother and sister's safety. There are so many incidents like not physically but mental torture etc and I started hating him even more.
This 18 October I returned home thinking maybe u will try to fix things like maybe talking to him in a polite manner to help him understand that he is wrong in those scenarios and all I wanted was just to be a happy family. Like I don't want my sister to go through all what I went through again. For her sake I talked to him that my sister needs her father's time like she miss him and she would value him more than any wealth and he understood so I thought maybe things will change. So tonight, my father suddenly called my mother and said not ask just said her to prepare 5-6 cup of coffee as he was with some friends or something and my mother prepared the coffee with 3 spoons of coffee. The colour of the colour was a bit milky but it was coffee. After 2 hours he comes and shout at my mother that who making coffee like that. Just shit coffee etc etc. My mother also said yes the colour might needed 1-2 spoon of coffee more. But he started swearing at him so I stopped him and said to him that why he has to curse always. He can say that politely and in peaceful tone not always in aggressive tone. And just for saying to him he said to me that now what you are going to hit me or will u say that I am wrong etc etc. I didn't even raise my voice and I said that in low tone for his good. And then he says that coming to house always makes him tense and disturb his peace and he cannot live with my mother so I just said then ""go where you can be happy and have peace if we are being so much nuisance to you."" And he got mad for me speaking back at him and he left home and went somewhere with suitcase maybe hotel or something. And my mother was crying and seeing her cry I wanted to cry but again I had to be her support. Like for last 6-7 years he haven't celebrated any festival peacefully like last 4 diwali same some fight or he was out somewhere. My sister's and my last 5 bday he goes out with his friends like he gave us money and a good standard of life but I never got the father love. Like what is my mistake like why I have to see my mother cry why I have to see my family break. I don't want anything just a peaceful and happy family nothing more. I used to pray to god for my mother, father and sister good health and happiness. I am fine suffering all alone for rest of my life but I am cannot see this pain in my mother's eye again and again. I just can't do anything for her just so useless maybe if I hadn't said anything or started saying at younger age maybe things were different. I am just a failure of as a son, brother. 
I can't even leave them in this state. I know I have to work hard so that I can take out my mother and sister from this state but how can I focus on anything when I paranoid if my mother is fine or not....I really don't know what to say or do..

I am just utter garbage and useless. ",3,1760898830.0,TwentiesIndia,5,1.0,False

He's 73 now.","Well... Let's start at the beginning (just of this chapter, not the entire book)...

It was a cool day in ancient Greece... Just playing.

Ok, 2 weeks ago, on Sunday 5 October 2025 at 3:30am my mom died of Neuro-lupus, she had been battling failing health for some time and had diabetes for over 30 years, so it wasn't exactly unexpected.

As you can tell, I dealt with her death many, many years ago, so it wasn't problematic to process for me.

My father though, he doesn't have a clue how to deal with, handle, or process anything whatsoever. So obviously he is struggling with this.

He also drinks too much ordinarily, so it's obviously worse at the moment due to the grief...

So he goes out yesterday afternoon to play bowls, yip he's a 73 year old man, of course he plays bowls, and obviously has a few extra drinks for the road as it were, and, long story short, he get's home shit-faced, and as is his custom, starts picking a fight... We have an argument but it remains only verbal, nothing physical, this is good, this is an improvement... Then he storms off, gets in his car and off he flies. God know where he's going but off he goes.

I finish my smoke slowly and a few minutes later I head to my flat.  
Next thing these 2 large men that I don't know, have never seen before, come walking towards me, in my own back garden...

These 2 men, grabbed me and my brother, hand-cuffed us as tight as the cuffs would close, pepper sprayed us so many times and for so long, directly into our eyes from point blank range... They kicked us to pieces, kicked me in the ribs so hard that I have a couple of bruised ribs and was struggling to breathe with the pain... They slapped and punched us repeatedly in the head and face. They broke my coffee table over me and then used the pieces as weapons. They literally jumped as high as they could and came down wih such force on my back and ribs...

All of this while still hand-cuffed and made to lie face down on the ground!

After literally beating my brother and I to a pulp for over an hour while hand-cuffed, they stole my cell phone, my laptop and all the cash I had on me.

They threatened to kill both me and my brother multiple times, and they never seemed to be too concerned with getting caught... Obviously there was a reason for their misguided trust and calmness...

Then they left.

As you can understand my broher and I were as scared as we've ever been, shaking, in shock, in serious pain, and also seriously confused...

I left the house immediately and walked to the police station 1 hour away, I opened a case, etc, and so it went.

Turns out... In his slightly drunker than usual state that he was in yesterday afternoon/evening, after the minor argument we had just had...

My dad decided to go and hire these 2 thugs, GIVE THEM HIS HOUSE KEYS AND GATE REMOTE and instructed them to enter the property, explained the basic layout and where my broher and I would be and instructed them to beat us senseless!

Yes, my father, hired 2 criminals to enter our family property, search for my broher and I, cuff us and literally go to town on us!! And he genuinely thought no one on earth would suspect him of anything.

When he got home this morning, he started off so bravely and confident, shouting at both of us, threatening to kick us out again, as usual... Until I mentioned to him that the Police would probably be here at some stage throughout the day to ask him about what happened last night. Ooh did the precious little attitude disappear like a fart in the wind I tell you... After a little umming and aahing, a little to and froing, he acknowledged that he had contacted someone who had these 2 connections who completed the job as per his request.

And with that admission, my father will spend the next 15 years in prison for aggrevated robbery, aggrevated assualt, conspiracy to commit robbery, etc. 15 years is the minimum in South Africa for a first offence of his nature and although he is 73, he is not infirm and he was plenty savvy enough to orchestrate this whole debacle so he must sit the full 15 years if he lasts anywhere nearly that long.",2,1760898820.0,CPTSD,3,0.75,False

The marriage breakdown was apparent for the last 9 months or so. Breakdown of trust and infidelity. I went through lots of sadness, guilt, blaming myself during this time and ultimately I was depressed.

Since separation, the first couple of months were raw sadness, then frustration, then anger.

I started therapy just after separation and am still doing it. I’ve had conversations about the following with my therapist but would like others’ views.

After the first couple of months, I felt like I was back on my feet. Started to feel myself and do things to make myself happy. Although I was a long way from happy I felt like I was going to be okay.

I reconnected with an old female friend a couple of months ago, maybe after 3 months of separation. I’ve been very cautious as am mindful that I want/need to be content on my own before committing to something new. I’m scared to be honest.

I’m aware of the pitfalls of post divorce, I.e. trying to replace something that’s now missing with someone new. I honestly don’t believe this is what I want, I want something new, different and exciting. But also something that isn’t just going to be a fling.

Anyway, in the last couple of weeks, I have met her for coffee (not labelled a date but felt like one). It felt like she was interested and we made plans to see each other again next month. She made comments hinting at future plans and that she could’ve ’stayed all day’.

After last week, we checked in with each other every day via text and had long text conversations, both seemingly on the same wavelength. A couple of days ago she just stopped replying and left me on read, even though there was a question in my last text. It’s not like her to do that as she is a very kind person and openly expresses that she doesn’t like it when people don’t reply.

This has left me feeling very down. This isn’t where I wanted to be at this stage of my ‘rebuild’. I promised myself I would focus on me and being happy but I feel like this is a massive setback. For what it’s worth I feel like I dealt with this situation really well up to this point, was the best version of myself when we met etc etc. I want to feel like I can just brush this off and get back to focusing on myself but it’s left me really down. I feel like I’m grieving again but this time for something that was never even a ‘thing’.

I’m so stuck. I don’t know how to shift my focus to myself. What can I do to be kind to myself?

This might be something I should’ve just stuck in a journal but would be grateful for advice from anyone who has experienced similar, whether the outcome was good or bad.

TLDR; not long post separation, find myself wanting a new relationship with a specific person. Also want to focus on myself. Been ghosted. Would welcome advice.",1,1760898777.0,Divorce,0,1.0,False

Dear Agent,

Thirty-one-year-old piano teacher Carly Bennett Welles has the perfect marriage—or at least the perfectly *contractual* one. Three years ago, after her father’s death and her mother’s mounting hospital bills, brilliant but emotionally unavailable math professor Ethan Welles offered her a practical solution: she’d get stability, he’d get the respectable wife required for tenure. After being his neighbour for years, the arrangement worked flawlessly. But that now the dust has settled on her life, Carly has decided she wants more than comfort and safety. She wants to fall in love with someone who doesn’t need a whiteboard to explain his feelings.

Ethan, meanwhile, has no intention of losing the comfortable wife he’s come to rely on—especially with a department-head promotion on the horizon. When Carly invokes the contract’s ninety-day “cooling-off” clause, he panics in the only way a man of equations can: by drafting a comprehensive plan to make her stay. Shared-activity schedules, praise metrics, and—most disastrously—a color-coded intimacy calendar (and a few regrettably daring costumes) soon follow. But as his methodical attempts at seduction spiral out of control, Carly begins to suspect her husband might actually have a heart beneath all that logic.

Of course, none of this helps when they’re suddenly hosting each other’s families for Thanksgiving, maintaining the illusion of marital bliss at faculty events, and fielding increasingly pointed questions from the handsome veterinarian in Carly’s choir—who’s very interested in what she means when she says she’ll be “free” once some paperwork clears.

She’s determined not to fall for him. He’s determined not to lose her. Neither expects that somewhere between proof and passion, they might actually solve for love.

*END OF TERM* is a warm, witty, slow-burn contemporary romance about a marriage of convenience evolving into true partnership, along the lines of *Would You Rather* by Allison Ashley. It is perfect for readers of Emily Henry, Ali Hazelwood, and Katherine Center.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

**First 300:**

Carly wasn’t sure how many married women needed to consult a three-hundred-page document before breaking up with their husband, but she suspected the number was comfortably close to one.

She squinted at the fine print, running her index finger along a page so dense with jargon it might as well have been in hieroglyphics. She’d practically signed this hefty binder of pages three years ago through tears of gratitude, deciding she would read it all later, whenever the chaos that had become her life had turned into something that resembled normalcy. 

Of course, it would have been much more prudent to have a lawyer look it over. But at the time, she’d barely been able to afford a coffee, let alone sound legal advice.

“Subsection Four, Paragraph B,” she read aloud, “stipulates that the *undersigned parties* shall maintain the appearance of domestic harmony in all public and professional settings, including but not limited to: dinner parties, university galas, and—” she stopped, blinking, “—seasonal bake sales?”

She looked down at Nash, who’d found a patch of sunlight to curl up in. His ears pricked up when she glanced over at him.

“When has Ethan Welles ever attended a seasonal bake sale?” she asked him. 

Nash only yawned, wagged his tail twice, and then went back to sleep. 

“Ah!” she cried, finally finding the clause she’d been looking for the past hour. “Either party may, upon written notice to the other, elect to dissolve the marital arrangement at any time and for any reason, without prejudice or penalty, provided that all outstanding joint obligations have been satisfied in full.”",3,1760898648.0,PubTips,3,0.67,False

We were together for 2.5 years and lived together for 6 months and greatly enjoyed eachothers company, but both ultimately agreed from a long-term goals perspective (kids, living abroad, career goals, etc.) that we were incompatible. It was sad but we left on good terms and we still catch up for drinks/coffee every couple months to check in about family, work, etc.

I can't stress enough how non-toxic our relationship and breakup were. I can only speak for myself but I believe she feels similarly that we both still care very deeply about eachother but both are mature enough to admit that we should not get married.

Since the breakup I've dated a bit casually but part of the reason I initiated it in the first place was I knew at this point in my life I was not capable of giving enough of myself to a committed relationship, so I have not resumed dating with intent. She is also still single.

The last time we got coffee we had a great time and ended up staying for way longer than intended, and were even maybe a bit flirty. Keep in mind this was over coffee NOT drinks so it wasn't even alcohol induced. I would be lying if I said I wasn't still sexually attracted to her, and I know you shouldn't just act on all of your inclinations, but I can't help but wonder about the viability of FWB/casual sex.

I know the first thing many of you will say is that we're bound to end up in a relationship again and I totally understand that possibility. I'm not even going to argue against that because I understand its human nature.

Regardless, I would like to hear some arguments for or against this. Please dissuade me or encourage me to entertain this idea. Thanks.",0,1760898571.0,relationship_advice,22,0.33,False

Alright then.

For those of you who’ve made it this far, I want to say―well, a lot of things. Let's start with thanks. Really. For those who haven't made it this far…I mean I'm gonna assume you aren't here, by definition, so nevermind.

When I first started posting my experiences on Route 333, it was a way to pass the time between hauls. I never expected so many people to offer so many words of comfort and support. Things can get lonely on the road, especially for someone like me. It’s easy to just slip away. You’ve all helped me not do that.

There are so many things I feel I should say to you all before I wrap things up. It’s a bit embarrassing to admit, but I’ve typed up literally a dozen different versions of farewells. None of them feel quite *right*. 

The thing my mind keeps returning to is a childhood memory. I’m not totally sure why. It’s not a particularly relevant memory―maybe not even a *real* one―but I thought I’d share that instead of an official goodbye. The feeling of it seems fitting. 

I’m on my booster seat with my face pressed against the cold car window. Speckles of rain clump and slide down the glass. Outside, it’s storming. Inside the car is warm.

We’re heading somewhere. I don’t know where. You usually don’t know where as a child, but neither do I especially care. I’m more focused on the distant shapes in the rain. Between the trees, they twist into forms, constantly on the verge of tangible but always disappearing the moment before it’s clear what they are.

“What’s out there?” I ask.

My mom leans to me from the passenger seat and gives my knee a squeeze. “It doesn’t matter, Brendon. We’re in here.”

My eyes grow heavy. I fall asleep to the sound of raindrops.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The end of the road.

The sight was bizarre to say the least. It didn’t dissolve into gravel. There were no potholes or cracked asphalt signaling abandonment. The highway was perfectly maintained up until the point it cut cleanly away. Wild forest stretched beyond.

I walked up and down, examining it.

Could we walk back? Without a vehicle, and with Autumn’s lane-locking, how long would that take? Decades at least, and even then…This felt *different* somehow. 

Route 333 wasn’t trying to divert us from our next move. It wasn’t slowing us down. It had simply decided *game over*. Without it, there likely wasn’t even a way back to the real world.

Wind tousled my hair. Autumn was still in the cab of my rig, entirely unaware of our newfound predicament. Did it even qualify as that? *Predicament* implied a problem, something that could be puzzled over and solved, but this? This new reality was so absolute.

For a long time I merely gazed into the forest. Eventually, I sat. My eyes slid closed. I waited.

It was odd. In my time on Route 333 I'd felt every conceivable emotion: anger, loss, betrayal, hope, relief, fear. I'd met so many people, seen so many things that shouldn't have been possible, and clenched my fist against enemies in ways I never imagined I'd be brave enough to do. I’d felt afraid. So afraid and so many times. I'd experienced everything a life could hold in the space of months.

This though? What I felt now? It was a new sensation for Route 333 and one I couldn’t entirely name. It was like lying on the beach and waiting for the waves to bury me beneath the sand, inevitable but not altogether horrifying.

A breeze rustled the leaves. Pine tree branches battered against one another, and bird wings flapped overhead―and something else. My eyes remained closed.

I turned my ear towards the noise, straining to make it out. *Crying.* Something was weeping out there in the forest. The sound grew clearer. I waited until the noise was right in front of me, feet away, before relaxing my spine and taking a look.

A child peeked out from behind a tree. Boy or girl, I couldn’t tell. We locked gazes.

“The real thing from my trailer would have driven me mad to look at,” I said. “You aren’t it.”

The child ducked its head behind the thick trunk. When it popped out on the other side, it was taller, an adult. Not just any adult.

“Myra,” I said.

She flattened her blouse.

“Choose someone else. Please.”

She only shrugged as if to say *well, I have to take the form of something.*

I started to protest, but already this simulacrum of my ex-girlfriend was walking toward me and sitting cross-legged to mirror my own pose. Her on the side of sticks and weeds. Me on the pavement. 

I studied her. “You aren’t one of the hitchhikers. You're something else.”

She stared at me. Her chest made no movement. She wasn’t breathing.

“What do you want?” My patience was souring. “What was the point of coming if you’re just going to sit there?”

“Nothing,” she said. “There is nothing I want.”

It took me aback. The voice―it sounded just like Myra, though with a hint of something *other* to it. I hadn't honestly expected her to speak, but now that she had, I had to respond.

 “Even trees want water.”

“Then I want nothing you would understand. We are not real in the same way, you and I.”

She lifted a hand and examined both sides. She paused on a vein and studied it in interest. Blood pumped enthusiastically through it. With her other hand she pushed a sharpened nail experimentally into the skin, further and further, until finally it broke.

For a few seconds, the severed vein gushed with blood, dark spurts intermingled with the red. She sniffed, licked at the wound. Smiled. Eventually, she shook her hand and the bleeding ceased. 

The skin of her hand was smooth.

“Why are you here?” I asked.

“I’m always here.”

“So you’re the highway.”

Myra shrugged. *Yes. No. To you it makes no difference.*

It took me longer than it should have to realize she hadn't spoken the words. Her lips hadn't moved at all. I hadn't even necessarily *heard* them, and yet they’d impressed themselves unbidden in my mind almost like they’d been my own thoughts. Perhaps they had been.

“But you’re the one who stole the road,” I said.

“Is it stealing when you clip your own fingernails?”

“And what is the road? If you’re the highway―or part of it somehow―then what are you exactly?”

“What you perceive as one thing can really be many things.” 

I sighed. “While I do admire your devotion to speak in cryptics, I’ve just had some very long, rather unpleasant last few days to which you're currently contributing. Any chance we could chat like normal people?”

Myra only relaxed into a maddeningly knowing smile. *Do you think me a person?*

In a way, I did. Perhaps that was the point of her form: to put me off guard. It was working. Consciously, I knew this wasn’t Myra. It didn’t even act like her, but on a deeper level, I already trusted her. 

This was the girl who’d selflessly loved me for most of the last three years. She’d brought me soup when I was sick and rubbed my back when I would study for exams. Myra was the person that even months later, I trusted completely, always, without reservation.

And I’d left her.

Despite everything that was going on, the danger and the hopelessness of this whole situation, a sudden, unresolvable sadness filled me from my chest to my throat.

“Please,” I choked out, clenching my eyes to keep tears from welling up. “Be something different.”

When I opened my eyes, Myra was gone. 

Something dark, ghoulish, and malevolent stared back at me, more terrible than any inhabitant I’d seen on the road. A roaring, throbbing pounding built in the back of my skull. I blinked again.

The thing was gone.

It was my own face I stared at.

He didn’t smile. There was none of the playfulness of the child or the confidence of the girl. Not even the evil of the last thing. This new boy merely sat across from me. There was a heaviness behind his eyes, *my* eyes. They could stare directly at the sun and still see only dark. They could shut for a thousand years, and still be weary when they opened.

It clicked.

“You’re a mirror,” I said. “Whatever you are, the highway or an impossibility, or―or whatever―you’re also me. *Us*.”

His face gave away nothing.

“If I’m right, then you know how badly we want to get out. You *understand* it. Why are you trapping us? Autumn was so close.”

“You were never close. Your trick was a hollow plan. The girl will never stop suspecting you of trying to save her, no matter what deceit you attempt, because she knows you will never give up. The only manner in which you made it this far is because I allowed it, as I allow the wanderers to traverse where they will.” *Hitchhikers,* my brain automatically filled in. 

“There is no need to restrict them,” he continued, “not when their kind is so restricted by boundaries. Conditions are in place to allow safe passage of misplaced cargo, but the girl has not fulfilled those conditions.”

“Then lane-lock her again,” I said. “Give us back the road, but leave her lane-locked. Both of us if you want.”

“You’re close to the end now. She would be gone within a handful of turnings.”

“So what? Why does it matter?”

He tapped a single finger against his chapped lips. Again, the foreign words popped up in my mind. *A reflection does not exist without something to reflect.*

“You’d disappear then? That’s why you want us?”

“As has been stated,” he said. “I don’t desire in the same way that you do you. I may speak with you, converse in a form similar to your own, but that does not change my nature. I don’t want you. I simply cannot let you go. It would unbalance me. There are rules in place.”

“Then why are you here!” Familiar anger warmed me. “You wanted to gloat, that’s it?”

“Remove her from the vehicle, and I will let you pass. You still have many years on the road.”

“Oh, yeah?” 

Instead, I cussed him out.

My mirrored-face, already hard, turned to stone. 

The branches around him dried, shriveled, and split. Inky, hard-shelled beetles and writhing maggots scuttled out from hidden places in the ground, crawling up his clothing and squirming up his neck. He opened his mouth and they piled in. His eyes―my eyes―darkened and expanded. They bulged in his skull. They popped.

Rotting fluid splattered my face and arms. I spit and gagged.

Behind me came a ripping, tearing, crunching. Despite the atrocities in front of me, I whirled. The freight container had collapsed in on itself, fully crumpled. The cab where Autumn slept was untouched, but the threat was obvious. We were only alive, because the highway was letting us be alive. Such omnipotent power should have terrified me.

Instead, I understood.

This thing could scare us, but it wouldn't kill us. It needed us to survive. Without people to occupy it, the road would shrivel to nothing at all, the carcass of a living thing, an abandoned warehouse set to blaze. Lane-locking unlocked pockets of reality that would never otherwise exist. Our very presence seemed to do the same. Route 333 wouldn't kill us―but it wouldn't let both of us go

Through my nose, I let out a long, slow breath. My eyes closed. I pictured Autumn, unconscious and unaware, on my sleeper. I envisioned her watching the back of my truck after every visit, at the gut-sinking feeling of being left alone. Entirely alone. I pictured Tiff at dispatch. Waiting.

“Alright,” I said. “You need a reflection. Take me.”

“Only a willing being may be traded to enter my domain. Only an unwilling being may be traded to leave. The conditions must be met.”

I barked a laugh. “Don’t you see? I *am* unwilling. Without Autumn, there’s no way I’m leaving Route 333. I refuse.”

The thing wearing my body considered.

“You *will* leave eventually,” he said. “We’re close to the end. Once she is gone, you will drive past the barrier as they all wish to do.”

“I’ll stay then.”

“Your promises are smoke in the wind. Perhaps you believe you will stay, but once the deal is made, you will have no reason not to flee. You will hate me as they all do.”

“But that's the best part.” My hand outstretched. I placed it against the person’s face. *My* face. “What must it be like? Maybe you and I aren’t real in the same way, but it can't be easy being hated by every person you've ever trapped―hundreds of years of loathing. If you're the mirror, what sort of shards does that break you into? I’m sorry. I really am.”

His eyebrows narrowed, but he didn't pull away from my touch.

“I don’t hate you,” I said. “Not anymore.”

“You will.”

I shook my head. “You saved me.”

“You broke my rules. I have attempted to extinguish you a multitude of times.”

I laughed. “Fair point. But it's more than that. Before you, my entire life was this gray, meaningless nothingness. Because of you, it's―well―” I took his hand and stretched it across the barrier between forest and road. I pressed the fingers to the pavement and inhaled. “―all of this.”

The sharp scent of pine enveloped us. Moist wood and wildflowers, but more than that: wet cement and gasoline. Metal and asphalt. The smell of nature and material bundled together, of rotting logs and budding flowers, of movement and going and travel and meaning\*.\* The smell of *living*.

“You don’t have to loathe yourself anymore,” I whispered. “I’ll never leave you.”

For a heartbeat, just one, his eyes shimmered―tears perhaps? The first flicker of human emotion?―then he stood, breaking our touch. 

*Deliver her home,* came the words. *Then return.*

He strode into the forest. When he passed behind his first tree, the body that emerged was Myra. When he passed the next, it was the weeping child. On the last pass, nothing reappeared at all. As if his final form was the air itself.

I made my way to the truck where Autumn still slept and turned the key in the ignition. When I looked up, a familiar road wound its way into the trees, snaking back and forth until finally plunging left, into the all-consuming redwoods―how it had always been.

Perhaps the highway had never disappeared at all. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Autumn woke up minutes later. Perhaps the boom of the collapsing trailer had jostled something in her subconscious―“time to get up, sweetie!”―or perhaps the drugs were finally losing their effect.

Either way, she was ticked.

“*How dare you!* You drugged me? We could have died on the way back! You didn’t even ask!”

“I mean, that was sort of the point,” I said.

“Don’t change the topic, you lying, untrustworthy―”

“Tiff made it out too.”

“―sniveling, pathetic… wait, Tiff? She’s out?”

“Yup. Back at dispatch. We’re like five minutes away.”

Autumn stuttered, but already her anger was fizzling. “Well *fine* then. I suppose that’s…acceptable, then.”

I laughed.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The reunion was nothing short of tear-jerking. 

Based on Tiff’s retelling of the last five years of her and her daughter’s relationship I’d expected yelling. A sprinkle of arguing, at the very least, with a dash of awkwardness. Instead, they collapsed into each other's arms, sobbing hysterically, and sank to the floor in the reception area.

Randall and I watched the interaction for a few unsure moments before glancing at each other.

He shrugged. “We should probably…”

“Let them…”

“Yeah.”

“Yep.”

I dragged myself to the break room to feed my ever-increasing coffee addiction―how many hours/days/etcetera had I been awake for now?―where I received my second (Third? Fourth? *Twentieth*?) surprise of the day.

Chris waved at me from the break room table where he was shoveling down a plateful of eggs. He did it all casual too, like *oh Brendon, fancy seeing you here in this high-security bank vault where it isn’t possible for us both to currently be. S’up?*

You’ll be happy to hear, I replied to his wave with one of my signature, snappy quips: “*Uh…*”

“Deidree brought me an hour or so ago.” Chris shrugged. “Pretended she was one of the hitchhikers and waved this pistol around until I got in her trailer. Told her she should quit and go into acting after she explained it all.”

I scanned the room.

“She’s already back out,” he said. “Told me she’s going for Al before it gets too dark.”

“Relentless that one.”

“If she were a few years older, I might ask her out to dinner.” He forked eggs into his mouth and pondered. “Huh. Maybe I will anyway.”

Delightful as it would be to engage with my stand-in grandpa lustfully ruminating about my stand-in grandma, I decided Chris could probably use some alone time. He’d gone through a lot these last few days.

I considered finding a spare couch to nap on, or maybe just heading back to my sleeper, but in the end, there was only one place I was truly sure nobody would come looking for me.

It was odd, entering Gloria’s office after all this time. The door was unlocked, but it was obvious nobody else had dared enter the room since her death. The trash was full; a candy bar wrapper lay fallen on the floor. A half-full glass of water sat on the desk. A white ring circled the spot where the water must have risen to before beginning to evaporate.

Chris, Al, Tiff, Autumn. Most of us had made it out alive, more than I could have hoped for―I turned a photo of Gloria and her family face down on the desk―but not everybody.

I fell asleep instantly. That’s the upside to sleep-deprivation. Racing thoughts at bedtime? Not anymore. Stress-induced insomnia? No problem. The only *slight* downside is spending the majority of your waking hours in a state of constant fatigue.

Left to myself, I suspect I would have stayed asleep for hours. Instead, I stirred awake an hour or two later, groggy but feeling significantly better. Somebody leaned against Gloria’s desk, staring out the window.

“Gah!” I clutched at my heart. “Do you make a habit of watching people while they sleep?”

“Coming from the guy who drugged me,” Autumn said.

*Fair enough.*

“How’d you find me?” I asked.

“This is where I would’ve come.”

Because she knew me. Remarkably, this girl could predict what I was about to say and do in a way nobody else ever had. She understood me.

And yet…

“Hey, Autumn. About the things I said back on the bridge―”

“I know,” she said. “You don’t have to explain anything to me. Actually, I’d prefer you didn’t. You were saying what you had to to get me out. Feelings. Ugh.”

“Gross.”

“Icky.” 

“Mushy.”

We laughed.

“But it wasn’t totally a lie,” I said. “Not all of it. I mean, I’m not in love with you, sorry, but you are my friend, you know? You really do, like, *get* me.”

“Don’t I know it. As soon as you left after the hitchhiker, I knew you’d be back. That’s just what you do. I kept imagining every way you might try to trick me or force me to go with you. I tried not to think about them. It was like… hmm. What’s a good metaphor?”

“How kids keep convincing themselves they believe in Santa for years after they don’t.”

Autumn snapped and nodded. “I tried to convince myself you *wouldn’t* trick me, so that I could believe you when you did―but I would have been willing. For anything else you tried, I would have subconsciously known what you were doing. I’d have been willing.”

Except she had been anyway. That’s what the road had confirmed. In the end, a small hidden part of Autumn had understood what was going on. She’d gone with me willingly, even as she’d denied and ranted and refused.

She hadn't known I was drugging her―that much I believed. But she had believed my other offer, that I would lane-lock myself with her for the next set of decades. She’d refused in the same way you tell your friend *no, you have the last slice of pie,* knowing they’ll say the same back and you still get to eat it. Eventually she would have agreed. Autumn would have let me sacrifice my future for her own.

I hoped she never realized that. What a terrible thing to know about yourself: that you would ruin somebody else’s life so yours could be a little bit better.

Or maybe *I* didn’t understand what five years in isolation could do to a person, the sort of desperate weed that grew from that type of soil.

I stood, approached the desk, and leaned on it next to her. We stared out the same smudged window.

“You know,” I said. “I do think, in another life, if we’d known each other longer and I were a little less broken, I could have meant what I said back there. Been *capable* of meaning it.”

“Oh, Brendon.” She tapped her shoulder to mine. “We’re not broken. We’re just healing.”

For a long time we sat, watching the birds outside, saying nothing at all.

In the end, I snuck out without a word to anyone. 

Diedree was still gone. Vikram and Estela were out for the day. Autumn was with her mother. Chris had left to see his own daughter, and Randall was―eh. Dunno. Terrorizing a puppy or something?

I selected my favorite rig (one with working A.C., thank you very much), hooked it up to another empty trailer, and set out. It was easier that way. It wasn’t like they couldn’t contact me over the radio or visit me on their hauls. This wasn’t a goodbye forever, not for most of them. It was merely me fulfilling my end of the deal.

As I drove, my mind drifted. I entered a trancelike state. I twisted through the redwoods without true comprehension.

It wasn’t sad, this fate. Not really. 

I wasn’t the same person who’d signed my job offer those months ago. The things I’d told the highway weren’t lies. Maybe I hadn't totally known them until I’d said them, but every word of them had been true. Route 333 had saved me―even if I still didn’t entirely understand who or what Route 333 was exactly. It was us but also its own person. Alive and not. It needed us to exist but formed itself without our permission. Something with desires and something with no desires at all. 

An impossibility.

But I could live with not understanding. Some things you don’t need to comprehend to accept.

It wasn’t gone, for the record. The empty thing inside me. It was still there, squeezing on my heart and stomach―but it *was* less empty. Before it was a hole. Now it was a tunnel: dark and hollow but leading to somewhere new.

I’d done it. 

I’d gotten them out.

Randall knew the secret. So did Chris, Deidree, Autumn, Tiff, and soon,  all of management. As long as they could keep it a secret, they could keep rescuing the other drivers. From now on they could remove impossibilities from our own world without sacrificing drivers in the process.

I rolled down my windows. Crisp evening air gushed through the cab.

My life had been short, but I’d done something good with it. I could be happy with that. Now I could rest.

And then. As I prepared myself for years of pine needles and towering redwoods, as I readied myself for a lifetime of lane-locked driving and moving and finally, *finally,* being able to let go―as I welcomed all of that, the treeline ended.

I careened past the forest section onto a flat stretch of desert I hadn't expected to reach for decades more.

I slowed and stopped.

For a long time, I watched the setting sun lower above distant mountains. Minutes passed. An hour. I didn’t even put the stalling truck into park, just kept my foot clamped down on the brake.

My trance was cut off by the blare of a horn. Another rig pulled up beside me on the wrong side of the road. Deidree rolled down her window.

“Engine problem?” she asked.

“Not exactly.”

“How long you been here? You passed me, what, an hour or so ago? You couldn’t have seen me. I was in a pocket. Saw you appear a mile ahead of me―gosh, I envy you young ones. You get everywhere so quick.”

Finally, I put my vehicle in park. “I assure you. I had no intention of making it this far this quickly.”

She barked a laugh, thinking I’d been joking.

“You take care. I’m off for Al. Hope he’s as much a coward as Chris was.” She plucked a gun from her passenger seat and waved it at me. “It’s a fake, but the shots sound real. You go get some rest. Sounds like you’ve been through the wringer.”

With that, she began rolling up her window.

“Hey Deidree!” I called. “Can I ask―well not to sound judgy, but I’m curious. You have three daughters, don’t you? Why haven’t you quit already? No offense, but isn’t the road a bit *dangerous* for a mom like you?”

“Course it’s dangerous. Life’s dangerous, but I suppose…” Her demeanor changed. She examined her steering wheel in sudden thought. “I’ve considered leaving. Haven’t we all? But I suppose it's because of my daughters I stay. College and all that.”

I slumped into my seat. 

Just as I'd suspected. She stayed because she *had* to. There were people she was protecting, a purpose to the madness, a reason to continue―

“Nah.” Deidree *hocked* and spat out her window. “Know what? Truth is I'd be hauling even without those drama demons. I stay for the same reason as you.”

“Uh. Why’s that?”

“Can’t leave. Every time I’ve thought about quitting, I knew I’d just end up wanting to come back. Sure, it’s dangerous, but there’s nowhere else like here. My day will come eventually. I’ll have to leave, but there’s a lot more miles between then and now. I know it. Road knows it too. Might as well drive.”

“Huh.”

The sun had completely disappeared beneath the horizon. The formerly pink sky had dulled to a dark blue.

“Plus―” Deidree leaned towards me. “―the pay’s great.”

With that, her rig inched forwards. She picked up speed. She vanished into the horizon.

A bit later, I maneuvered my truck into a pullout and turned it around, heading back into the sea of trees. Perhaps it was my imagination or a fatigue-induced hallucination, but as I turned the bend, I swear there was a figure waving at me from behind a tree, one with extra-long fingers and nothing but two nostrils on a perfectly flat face.

I’m a trucker on a highway that doesn’t exist.

I’ve hauled for quite some time now. Not as long as some but longer than others. I spend most of my time on this highway, dangerous as it sometimes is. We have an understanding, it and me.

Sometimes, I leave for short stretches: a week off at my apartment, a trip to my parents, a wedding, a visit to an old friend. It’s never for long, but when I depart, the road will rumble on my way out―not angry, more annoyed. It doesn’t like me gone, but it knows I’m not leaving it in any real way. I’ll come back. 

I always do.

After all, there are things that need transporting, things that are harmful if you leave them in one place for too long. We wish there were an easy answer, a button to push to destroy them or armor to wear to ensure safety in our travels. Instead, the solution is a slow and dangerous one. We resolve this impossible issue one haul at a time. 

It isn't always easy to see the point to the fight when there’s no conclusion in sight, but on those days, I find purpose in a thousand other, microscopic things. A decent cup of coffee. Wildflowers growing somewhere without water. The sun breaking between the branches.

There are hideous things on the road, *deadly* things.

There are beautiful things too.

For many, this highway lengthens over time, forces them to leave this profession. For me, it remains the same length that it’s always been. Even so, I know one day this will all end.

Perhaps something from a side street will lure me away, or I’ll forget to close my window one sweltering summer night. Perhaps a red rain will swallow me whole. Perhaps the words *it is time* will whisper themselves in my mind, almost as if it's my own self thinking them. Then I will drive past impossible canyons and tumbleweeds that roll without a wind to push them, past the laws of physics and reality itself. I’ll set out on a journey to somewhere new and never turn back.

I don’t know how it all ends. Only that it will. There are many miles between now and that eventual conclusion, years even.

This was the first time I've painted Eldar. I got a bunch from the Combat Patrol magazine.  I had been playing Morrowind recently, and it occurred to me that the bonemold armour worn by the Hlaalu and Redoran guards was somewhat reminiscent of the Eldar Guardians.  

Main armour colour is Nazdreg Yellow. Chitin weapons (and jetbikes) are Aggaros Dunes.  Wraithguard are Aethermatic Blue.  Glass weapons are Soulstone Green over silver. Everything else is traditional paints.

The terrain is made from EPS foam (not the best material for the purpose, but I had a big sheet that had been sitting around for ages), home-made sculptamold, plaster of paris, and sand.  Sprayed Mechanicus Standard Grey, with a few light puffs of red and green to add variety.  Then lots of washes (a whole bottle of Nuln Oil, plus some Agrax, and Athonian Cammo).

The tomb entrance is clay, with the door made from matchsticks and coffee stirrers.  I made the mistake of not checking what an Ancestral Tomb actually looked like before carving the train, so when I carved the hillside I didn't make it high enough to fit the double arch that authentic tomb entrances have.

Alright then.

For those of you who’ve made it this far, I want to say―well, a lot of things. Let's start with thanks. Really. For those who haven't made it this far…I mean I'm gonna assume you aren't here, by definition, so nevermind.

When I first started posting my experiences on Route 333, it was a way to pass the time between hauls. I never expected so many people to offer so many words of comfort and support. Things can get lonely on the road, especially for someone like me. It’s easy to just slip away. You’ve all helped me not do that.

There are so many things I feel I should say to you all before I wrap things up. It’s a bit embarrassing to admit, but I’ve typed up literally a dozen different versions of farewells. None of them feel quite *right*. 

The thing my mind keeps returning to is a childhood memory. I’m not totally sure why. It’s not a particularly relevant memory―maybe not even a *real* one―but I thought I’d share that instead of an official goodbye. The feeling of it seems fitting. 

I’m on my booster seat with my face pressed against the cold car window. Speckles of rain clump and slide down the glass. Outside, it’s storming. Inside the car is warm.

We’re heading somewhere. I don’t know where. You usually don’t know where as a child, but neither do I especially care. I’m more focused on the distant shapes in the rain. Between the trees, they twist into forms, constantly on the verge of tangible but always disappearing the moment before it’s clear what they are.

“What’s out there?” I ask.

My mom leans to me from the passenger seat and gives my knee a squeeze. “It doesn’t matter, Brendon. We’re in here.”

My eyes grow heavy. I fall asleep to the sound of raindrops.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The end of the road.

The sight was bizarre to say the least. It didn’t dissolve into gravel. There were no potholes or cracked asphalt signaling abandonment. The highway was perfectly maintained up until the point it cut cleanly away. Wild forest stretched beyond.

I walked up and down, examining it.

Could we walk back? Without a vehicle, and with Autumn’s lane-locking, how long would that take? Decades at least, and even then…This felt *different* somehow. 

Route 333 wasn’t trying to divert us from our next move. It wasn’t slowing us down. It had simply decided *game over*. Without it, there likely wasn’t even a way back to the real world.

Wind tousled my hair. Autumn was still in the cab of my rig, entirely unaware of our newfound predicament. Did it even qualify as that? *Predicament* implied a problem, something that could be puzzled over and solved, but this? This new reality was so absolute.

For a long time I merely gazed into the forest. Eventually, I sat. My eyes slid closed. I waited.

It was odd. In my time on Route 333 I'd felt every conceivable emotion: anger, loss, betrayal, hope, relief, fear. I'd met so many people, seen so many things that shouldn't have been possible, and clenched my fist against enemies in ways I never imagined I'd be brave enough to do. I’d felt afraid. So afraid and so many times. I'd experienced everything a life could hold in the space of months.

This though? What I felt now? It was a new sensation for Route 333 and one I couldn’t entirely name. It was like lying on the beach and waiting for the waves to bury me beneath the sand, inevitable but not altogether horrifying.

A breeze rustled the leaves. Pine tree branches battered against one another, and bird wings flapped overhead―and something else. My eyes remained closed.

I turned my ear towards the noise, straining to make it out. *Crying.* Something was weeping out there in the forest. The sound grew clearer. I waited until the noise was right in front of me, feet away, before relaxing my spine and taking a look.

A child peeked out from behind a tree. Boy or girl, I couldn’t tell. We locked gazes.

“The real thing from my trailer would have driven me mad to look at,” I said. “You aren’t it.”

The child ducked its head behind the thick trunk. When it popped out on the other side, it was taller, an adult. Not just any adult.

“Myra,” I said.

She flattened her blouse.

“Choose someone else. Please.”

She only shrugged as if to say *well, I have to take the form of something.*

I started to protest, but already this simulacrum of my ex-girlfriend was walking toward me and sitting cross-legged to mirror my own pose. Her on the side of sticks and weeds. Me on the pavement. 

I studied her. “You aren’t one of the hitchhikers. You're something else.”

She stared at me. Her chest made no movement. She wasn’t breathing.

“What do you want?” My patience was souring. “What was the point of coming if you’re just going to sit there?”

“Nothing,” she said. “There is nothing I want.”

It took me aback. The voice―it sounded just like Myra, though with a hint of something *other* to it. I hadn't honestly expected her to speak, but now that she had, I had to respond.

 “Even trees want water.”

“Then I want nothing you would understand. We are not real in the same way, you and I.”

She lifted a hand and examined both sides. She paused on a vein and studied it in interest. Blood pumped enthusiastically through it. With her other hand she pushed a sharpened nail experimentally into the skin, further and further, until finally it broke.

For a few seconds, the severed vein gushed with blood, dark spurts intermingled with the red. She sniffed, licked at the wound. Smiled. Eventually, she shook her hand and the bleeding ceased. 

The skin of her hand was smooth.

“Why are you here?” I asked.

“I’m always here.”

“So you’re the highway.”

Myra shrugged. *Yes. No. To you it makes no difference.*

It took me longer than it should have to realize she hadn't spoken the words. Her lips hadn't moved at all. I hadn't even necessarily *heard* them, and yet they’d impressed themselves unbidden in my mind almost like they’d been my own thoughts. Perhaps they had been.

“But you’re the one who stole the road,” I said.

“Is it stealing when you clip your own fingernails?”

“And what is the road? If you’re the highway―or part of it somehow―then what are you exactly?”

“What you perceive as one thing can really be many things.” 

I sighed. “While I do admire your devotion to speak in cryptics, I’ve just had some very long, rather unpleasant last few days to which you're currently contributing. Any chance we could chat like normal people?”

Myra only relaxed into a maddeningly knowing smile. *Do you think me a person?*

In a way, I did. Perhaps that was the point of her form: to put me off guard. It was working. Consciously, I knew this wasn’t Myra. It didn’t even act like her, but on a deeper level, I already trusted her. 

This was the girl who’d selflessly loved me for most of the last three years. She’d brought me soup when I was sick and rubbed my back when I would study for exams. Myra was the person that even months later, I trusted completely, always, without reservation.

And I’d left her.

Despite everything that was going on, the danger and the hopelessness of this whole situation, a sudden, unresolvable sadness filled me from my chest to my throat.

“Please,” I choked out, clenching my eyes to keep tears from welling up. “Be something different.”

When I opened my eyes, Myra was gone. 

Something dark, ghoulish, and malevolent stared back at me, more terrible than any inhabitant I’d seen on the road. A roaring, throbbing pounding built in the back of my skull. I blinked again.

The thing was gone.

It was my own face I stared at.

He didn’t smile. There was none of the playfulness of the child or the confidence of the girl. Not even the evil of the last thing. This new boy merely sat across from me. There was a heaviness behind his eyes, *my* eyes. They could stare directly at the sun and still see only dark. They could shut for a thousand years, and still be weary when they opened.

It clicked.

“You’re a mirror,” I said. “Whatever you are, the highway or an impossibility, or―or whatever―you’re also me. *Us*.”

His face gave away nothing.

“If I’m right, then you know how badly we want to get out. You *understand* it. Why are you trapping us? Autumn was so close.”

“You were never close. Your trick was a hollow plan. The girl will never stop suspecting you of trying to save her, no matter what deceit you attempt, because she knows you will never give up. The only manner in which you made it this far is because I allowed it, as I allow the wanderers to traverse where they will.” *Hitchhikers,* my brain automatically filled in. 

“There is no need to restrict them,” he continued, “not when their kind is so restricted by boundaries. Conditions are in place to allow safe passage of misplaced cargo, but the girl has not fulfilled those conditions.”

“Then lane-lock her again,” I said. “Give us back the road, but leave her lane-locked. Both of us if you want.”

“You’re close to the end now. She would be gone within a handful of turnings.”

“So what? Why does it matter?”

He tapped a single finger against his chapped lips. Again, the foreign words popped up in my mind. *A reflection does not exist without something to reflect.*

“You’d disappear then? That’s why you want us?”

“As has been stated,” he said. “I don’t desire in the same way that you do you. I may speak with you, converse in a form similar to your own, but that does not change my nature. I don’t want you. I simply cannot let you go. It would unbalance me. There are rules in place.”

“Then why are you here!” Familiar anger warmed me. “You wanted to gloat, that’s it?”

“Remove her from the vehicle, and I will let you pass. You still have many years on the road.”

“Oh, yeah?” 

Instead, I cussed him out.

My mirrored-face, already hard, turned to stone. 

The branches around him dried, shriveled, and split. Inky, hard-shelled beetles and writhing maggots scuttled out from hidden places in the ground, crawling up his clothing and squirming up his neck. He opened his mouth and they piled in. His eyes―my eyes―darkened and expanded. They bulged in his skull. They popped.

Rotting fluid splattered my face and arms. I spit and gagged.

Behind me came a ripping, tearing, crunching. Despite the atrocities in front of me, I whirled. The freight container had collapsed in on itself, fully crumpled. The cab where Autumn slept was untouched, but the threat was obvious. We were only alive, because the highway was letting us be alive. Such omnipotent power should have terrified me.

Instead, I understood.

This thing could scare us, but it wouldn't kill us. It needed us to survive. Without people to occupy it, the road would shrivel to nothing at all, the carcass of a living thing, an abandoned warehouse set to blaze. Lane-locking unlocked pockets of reality that would never otherwise exist. Our very presence seemed to do the same. Route 333 wouldn't kill us―but it wouldn't let both of us go

Through my nose, I let out a long, slow breath. My eyes closed. I pictured Autumn, unconscious and unaware, on my sleeper. I envisioned her watching the back of my truck after every visit, at the gut-sinking feeling of being left alone. Entirely alone. I pictured Tiff at dispatch. Waiting.

“Alright,” I said. “You need a reflection. Take me.”

“Only a willing being may be traded to enter my domain. Only an unwilling being may be traded to leave. The conditions must be met.”

I barked a laugh. “Don’t you see? I *am* unwilling. Without Autumn, there’s no way I’m leaving Route 333. I refuse.”

The thing wearing my body considered.

“You *will* leave eventually,” he said. “We’re close to the end. Once she is gone, you will drive past the barrier as they all wish to do.”

“I’ll stay then.”

“Your promises are smoke in the wind. Perhaps you believe you will stay, but once the deal is made, you will have no reason not to flee. You will hate me as they all do.”

“But that's the best part.” My hand outstretched. I placed it against the person’s face. *My* face. “What must it be like? Maybe you and I aren’t real in the same way, but it can't be easy being hated by every person you've ever trapped―hundreds of years of loathing. If you're the mirror, what sort of shards does that break you into? I’m sorry. I really am.”

His eyebrows narrowed, but he didn't pull away from my touch.

“I don’t hate you,” I said. “Not anymore.”

“You will.”

I shook my head. “You saved me.”

“You broke my rules. I have attempted to extinguish you a multitude of times.”

I laughed. “Fair point. But it's more than that. Before you, my entire life was this gray, meaningless nothingness. Because of you, it's―well―” I took his hand and stretched it across the barrier between forest and road. I pressed the fingers to the pavement and inhaled. “―all of this.”

The sharp scent of pine enveloped us. Moist wood and wildflowers, but more than that: wet cement and gasoline. Metal and asphalt. The smell of nature and material bundled together, of rotting logs and budding flowers, of movement and going and travel and meaning\*.\* The smell of *living*.

“You don’t have to loathe yourself anymore,” I whispered. “I’ll never leave you.”

For a heartbeat, just one, his eyes shimmered―tears perhaps? The first flicker of human emotion?―then he stood, breaking our touch. 

*Deliver her home,* came the words. *Then return.*

He strode into the forest. When he passed behind his first tree, the body that emerged was Myra. When he passed the next, it was the weeping child. On the last pass, nothing reappeared at all. As if his final form was the air itself.

I made my way to the truck where Autumn still slept and turned the key in the ignition. When I looked up, a familiar road wound its way into the trees, snaking back and forth until finally plunging left, into the all-consuming redwoods―how it had always been.

Perhaps the highway had never disappeared at all. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Autumn woke up minutes later. Perhaps the boom of the collapsing trailer had jostled something in her subconscious―“time to get up, sweetie!”―or perhaps the drugs were finally losing their effect.

Either way, she was ticked.

“*How dare you!* You drugged me? We could have died on the way back! You didn’t even ask!”

“I mean, that was sort of the point,” I said.

“Don’t change the topic, you lying, untrustworthy―”

“Tiff made it out too.”

“―sniveling, pathetic… wait, Tiff? She’s out?”

“Yup. Back at dispatch. We’re like five minutes away.”

Autumn stuttered, but already her anger was fizzling. “Well *fine* then. I suppose that’s…acceptable, then.”

I laughed.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The reunion was nothing short of tear-jerking. 

Based on Tiff’s retelling of the last five years of her and her daughter’s relationship I’d expected yelling. A sprinkle of arguing, at the very least, with a dash of awkwardness. Instead, they collapsed into each other's arms, sobbing hysterically, and sank to the floor in the reception area.

Randall and I watched the interaction for a few unsure moments before glancing at each other.

He shrugged. “We should probably…”

“Let them…”

“Yeah.”

“Yep.”

I dragged myself to the break room to feed my ever-increasing coffee addiction―how many hours/days/etcetera had I been awake for now?―where I received my second (Third? Fourth? *Twentieth*?) surprise of the day.

Chris waved at me from the break room table where he was shoveling down a plateful of eggs. He did it all casual too, like *oh Brendon, fancy seeing you here in this high-security bank vault where it isn’t possible for us both to currently be. S’up?*

You’ll be happy to hear, I replied to his wave with one of my signature, snappy quips: “*Uh…*”

“Deidree brought me an hour or so ago.” Chris shrugged. “Pretended she was one of the hitchhikers and waved this pistol around until I got in her trailer. Told her she should quit and go into acting after she explained it all.”

I scanned the room.

“She’s already back out,” he said. “Told me she’s going for Al before it gets too dark.”

“Relentless that one.”

“If she were a few years older, I might ask her out to dinner.” He forked eggs into his mouth and pondered. “Huh. Maybe I will anyway.”

Delightful as it would be to engage with my stand-in grandpa lustfully ruminating about my stand-in grandma, I decided Chris could probably use some alone time. He’d gone through a lot these last few days.

I considered finding a spare couch to nap on, or maybe just heading back to my sleeper, but in the end, there was only one place I was truly sure nobody would come looking for me.

It was odd, entering Gloria’s office after all this time. The door was unlocked, but it was obvious nobody else had dared enter the room since her death. The trash was full; a candy bar wrapper lay fallen on the floor. A half-full glass of water sat on the desk. A white ring circled the spot where the water must have risen to before beginning to evaporate.

Chris, Al, Tiff, Autumn. Most of us had made it out alive, more than I could have hoped for―I turned a photo of Gloria and her family face down on the desk―but not everybody.

I fell asleep instantly. That’s the upside to sleep-deprivation. Racing thoughts at bedtime? Not anymore. Stress-induced insomnia? No problem. The only *slight* downside is spending the majority of your waking hours in a state of constant fatigue.

Left to myself, I suspect I would have stayed asleep for hours. Instead, I stirred awake an hour or two later, groggy but feeling significantly better. Somebody leaned against Gloria’s desk, staring out the window.

“Gah!” I clutched at my heart. “Do you make a habit of watching people while they sleep?”

“Coming from the guy who drugged me,” Autumn said.

*Fair enough.*

“How’d you find me?” I asked.

“This is where I would’ve come.”

Because she knew me. Remarkably, this girl could predict what I was about to say and do in a way nobody else ever had. She understood me.

And yet…

“Hey, Autumn. About the things I said back on the bridge―”

“I know,” she said. “You don’t have to explain anything to me. Actually, I’d prefer you didn’t. You were saying what you had to to get me out. Feelings. Ugh.”

“Gross.”

“Icky.” 

“Mushy.”

We laughed.

“But it wasn’t totally a lie,” I said. “Not all of it. I mean, I’m not in love with you, sorry, but you are my friend, you know? You really do, like, *get* me.”

“Don’t I know it. As soon as you left after the hitchhiker, I knew you’d be back. That’s just what you do. I kept imagining every way you might try to trick me or force me to go with you. I tried not to think about them. It was like… hmm. What’s a good metaphor?”

“How kids keep convincing themselves they believe in Santa for years after they don’t.”

Autumn snapped and nodded. “I tried to convince myself you *wouldn’t* trick me, so that I could believe you when you did―but I would have been willing. For anything else you tried, I would have subconsciously known what you were doing. I’d have been willing.”

Except she had been anyway. That’s what the road had confirmed. In the end, a small hidden part of Autumn had understood what was going on. She’d gone with me willingly, even as she’d denied and ranted and refused.

She hadn't known I was drugging her―that much I believed. But she had believed my other offer, that I would lane-lock myself with her for the next set of decades. She’d refused in the same way you tell your friend *no, you have the last slice of pie,* knowing they’ll say the same back and you still get to eat it. Eventually she would have agreed. Autumn would have let me sacrifice my future for her own.

I hoped she never realized that. What a terrible thing to know about yourself: that you would ruin somebody else’s life so yours could be a little bit better.

Or maybe *I* didn’t understand what five years in isolation could do to a person, the sort of desperate weed that grew from that type of soil.

I stood, approached the desk, and leaned on it next to her. We stared out the same smudged window.

“You know,” I said. “I do think, in another life, if we’d known each other longer and I were a little less broken, I could have meant what I said back there. Been *capable* of meaning it.”

“Oh, Brendon.” She tapped her shoulder to mine. “We’re not broken. We’re just healing.”

For a long time we sat, watching the birds outside, saying nothing at all.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In the end, I snuck out without a word to anyone. 

Diedree was still gone. Vikram and Estela were out for the day. Autumn was with her mother. Chris had left to see his own daughter, and Randall was―eh. Dunno. Terrorizing a puppy or something?

I selected my favorite rig (one with working A.C., thank you very much), hooked it up to another empty trailer, and set out. It was easier that way. It wasn’t like they couldn’t contact me over the radio or visit me on their hauls. This wasn’t a goodbye forever, not for most of them. It was merely me fulfilling my end of the deal.

As I drove, my mind drifted. I entered a trancelike state. I twisted through the redwoods without true comprehension.

It wasn’t sad, this fate. Not really. 

I wasn’t the same person who’d signed my job offer those months ago. The things I’d told the highway weren’t lies. Maybe I hadn't totally known them until I’d said them, but every word of them had been true. Route 333 had saved me―even if I still didn’t entirely understand who or what Route 333 was exactly. It was us but also its own person. Alive and not. It needed us to exist but formed itself without our permission. Something with desires and something with no desires at all. 

An impossibility.

But I could live with not understanding. Some things you don’t need to comprehend to accept.

It wasn’t gone, for the record. The empty thing inside me. It was still there, squeezing on my heart and stomach―but it *was* less empty. Before it was a hole. Now it was a tunnel: dark and hollow but leading to somewhere new.

I’d done it. 

I’d gotten them out.

Randall knew the secret. So did Chris, Deidree, Autumn, Tiff, and soon,  all of management. As long as they could keep it a secret, they could keep rescuing the other drivers. From now on they could remove impossibilities from our own world without sacrificing drivers in the process.

I rolled down my windows. Crisp evening air gushed through the cab.

My life had been short, but I’d done something good with it. I could be happy with that. Now I could rest.

And then. As I prepared myself for years of pine needles and towering redwoods, as I readied myself for a lifetime of lane-locked driving and moving and finally, *finally,* being able to let go―as I welcomed all of that, the treeline ended.

I careened past the forest section onto a flat stretch of desert I hadn't expected to reach for decades more.

I slowed and stopped.

For a long time, I watched the setting sun lower above distant mountains. Minutes passed. An hour. I didn’t even put the stalling truck into park, just kept my foot clamped down on the brake.

My trance was cut off by the blare of a horn. Another rig pulled up beside me on the wrong side of the road. Deidree rolled down her window.

“Engine problem?” she asked.

“Not exactly.”

“How long you been here? You passed me, what, an hour or so ago? You couldn’t have seen me. I was in a pocket. Saw you appear a mile ahead of me―gosh, I envy you young ones. You get everywhere so quick.”

Finally, I put my vehicle in park. “I assure you. I had no intention of making it this far this quickly.”

She barked a laugh, thinking I’d been joking.

“You take care. I’m off for Al. Hope he’s as much a coward as Chris was.” She plucked a gun from her passenger seat and waved it at me. “It’s a fake, but the shots sound real. You go get some rest. Sounds like you’ve been through the wringer.”

With that, she began rolling up her window.

“Hey Deidree!” I called. “Can I ask―well not to sound judgy, but I’m curious. You have three daughters, don’t you? Why haven’t you quit already? No offense, but isn’t the road a bit *dangerous* for a mom like you?”

“Course it’s dangerous. Life’s dangerous, but I suppose…” Her demeanor changed. She examined her steering wheel in sudden thought. “I’ve considered leaving. Haven’t we all? But I suppose it's because of my daughters I stay. College and all that.”

I slumped into my seat. 

Just as I'd suspected. She stayed because she *had* to. There were people she was protecting, a purpose to the madness, a reason to continue―

“Nah.” Deidree *hocked* and spat out her window. “Know what? Truth is I'd be hauling even without those drama demons. I stay for the same reason as you.”

“Uh. Why’s that?”

“Can’t leave. Every time I’ve thought about quitting, I knew I’d just end up wanting to come back. Sure, it’s dangerous, but there’s nowhere else like here. My day will come eventually. I’ll have to leave, but there’s a lot more miles between then and now. I know it. Road knows it too. Might as well drive.”

“Huh.”

The sun had completely disappeared beneath the horizon. The formerly pink sky had dulled to a dark blue.

“Plus―” Deidree leaned towards me. “―the pay’s great.”

With that, her rig inched forwards. She picked up speed. She vanished into the horizon.

A bit later, I maneuvered my truck into a pullout and turned it around, heading back into the sea of trees. Perhaps it was my imagination or a fatigue-induced hallucination, but as I turned the bend, I swear there was a figure waving at me from behind a tree, one with extra-long fingers and nothing but two nostrils on a perfectly flat face.

I’m a trucker on a highway that doesn’t exist.

I’ve hauled for quite some time now. Not as long as some but longer than others. I spend most of my time on this highway, dangerous as it sometimes is. We have an understanding, it and me.

Sometimes, I leave for short stretches: a week off at my apartment, a trip to my parents, a wedding, a visit to an old friend. It’s never for long, but when I depart, the road will rumble on my way out―not angry, more annoyed. It doesn’t like me gone, but it knows I’m not leaving it in any real way. I’ll come back. 

I always do.

After all, there are things that need transporting, things that are harmful if you leave them in one place for too long. We wish there were an easy answer, a button to push to destroy them or armor to wear to ensure safety in our travels. Instead, the solution is a slow and dangerous one. We resolve this impossible issue one haul at a time. 

It isn't always easy to see the point to the fight when there’s no conclusion in sight, but on those days, I find purpose in a thousand other, microscopic things. A decent cup of coffee. Wildflowers growing somewhere without water. The sun breaking between the branches.

There are hideous things on the road, *deadly* things.

There are beautiful things too.

For many, this highway lengthens over time, forces them to leave this profession. For me, it remains the same length that it’s always been. Even so, I know one day this will all end.

Perhaps something from a side street will lure me away, or I’ll forget to close my window one sweltering summer night. Perhaps a red rain will swallow me whole. Perhaps the words *it is time* will whisper themselves in my mind, almost as if it's my own self thinking them. Then I will drive past impossible canyons and tumbleweeds that roll without a wind to push them, past the laws of physics and reality itself. I’ll set out on a journey to somewhere new and never turn back.

I don’t know how it all ends. Only that it will. There are many miles between now and that eventual conclusion, years even. 

I think I’ll drive a while longer.

About two years ago I had a dream that my best friend was calling out for me. 

In my visuals absolutely everything was black except for in the center of the darkness where my friends arms were outstretched towards me as if she was reaching for me. The darkness was swirling almost like a black hole and she was all I could see directly in the middle of it all. Her face & her arms reaching for me as she screamed out “I can’t breathe.”

Woke up from the dream in a sweat and old boyfriend convinced me it was a nightmare. Convinced me I’d see her for morning coffee and it would be just fine. 

The next morning I woke up to a text message. She died in the night from complications of her heart condition. She couldnt breathe and officially died of cyanosis. 

She was found with her arms stretching and stuck upward as if she was reaching for the sky.

I have no family other than my parents, but we’re estranged due to their emotional immaturity. Our relationship as they age into their 70s is very surface level, and I don’t feel love from interacting with them. 

I’d lean on my friends, but that’s also a struggle. I have two “best” friends who really get me, but one is long distance, while the other is just super busy with family and kids. Both have a slew of personal issues they deal with, which drain them. It’s hard to lean into them when they’re distant/dealing with so much. 

Compounding these feelings is the recent and sudden loss of what I thought was a real emotional and romantic connection. I hadn’t dated anyone these past two years after leaving my problematic ex I was with for 10 years. I’ve tried to date, but I just don’t meet people in my area who I connect with. It’s always been hard enough for me to make platonic connections, so it makes sense that I would struggle with dating. 

I met a man a few months back with whom I thought I shared a real connection. I was guarded at first, but he persuaded me to let my guards down and let him in. So I did. I even told him I’m autistic, something that I don’t share. I thought I could share this with him because he was ND. I told him that I thought he might be autistic too. He told me that he loved me and wanted to build a life together. 

Then he became cold and distant. Ghosted me. I don’t know if he lied to me about everything, maybe he used me. I want to believe our connection was genuine, and he got scared. Maybe he’s what they call an avoidant. All I know is that it’s been weeks since I’ve heard from him, and then…I saw him at the coffee shop yesterday with someone else. I don’t know if he was talking to her the entire time he was talking to me. I’m so hurt.

In reflection, I’ve realized that my overall state of profound loneliness and lack of any deep emotional connections is fueling my anger and resentment over whatever me and this guy had. Truth is, I’ve been feeling empty for some time. I have no desire to reconnect with my long-term ex, but I miss him for the connection we had. We had the deeper level of understanding that I so deeply crave. 

Everything in my life feels so surface level right now. I crave authentic connection. To be seen and understood. To have someone care for me in the way I care for others. I want to be loved. I’ve done a lot of work on myself these past few years. I’ve grown to love myself, more than I ever have. I know my worth, yet I want *more*. More than just me. Maybe we shouldn’t rely on others to fulfill us, but I’m so lonely.

The answer to my profound loneliness should be to pour into myself. I enjoy my time spent alone, and love spending time at home reading, baking, knitting, catching up on shows, loving on my cats. It’s just getting *too* lonely. I have no problem going out and doing things by myself, but I feel alone. When I go out I’m surrounded by people who have connections. People who love one another. And there I am, the alien in the back of the room. Just watching and observing how normal people behave.

*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Who Still Thinks “Penalty Kick” Is a Type of Coffee*

---

**Parsing the Odds: The Math of Misery and Mild Hope**  
Let’s start with the numbers, because even Anthony Lopes’ gloves can’t buffer a statistical reality check. Lille (-375) is the favorite here, with implied odds suggesting they’ll win \~59% of the time. Nantes (+900) is a long shot at 10%, and the draw sits at 31%. Translating that into plain English: Lille is the “probably gonna happen” choice, Nantes is “only if a comet strikes the stadium,” and a draw is “eh, possible, but why not bet on your neighbor’s pet goldfish to juggle oranges instead?”

The decimal lines (Lille at \~1.67, Nantes \~5.0) tell a similar story. For context, Lille’s recent form is like a toddler on a sugar rush—three straight losses in Ligue 1, including a 3-0 drubbing by Lens and a 1-0 humbling by Lyon. Yet, they’ve won both Europa League matches this season. Meanwhile, Nantes has gone 3-0-3, with three straight draws (2-2, 2-2, 0-0) to look like the most boring soap opera since “The Office” reboot.

---

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Europa, and the Curse of the “Almost Good”**  
Lille’s woes? Recent form is a dumpster fire. Their defense looks like a sieve dipped in honey—opponents have scored 7 goals in their last three matches. But here’s the twist: They’re a different team in Europe. Their Europa League dominance (2-0-0) suggests they can still summon magic when the stakes feel… *less* urgent. Is it “squad depth”? Is it “tactical reset”? Or is it just players remembering how to tie their boots properly? We’ll never know.

Nantes? Their defense is solid, thanks to Anthony Lopes, who’s conceded just 7 goals this season. Think of him as the goalkeeper equivalent of a dad in a Marvel movie—unimpressive until he’s suddenly saving the universe with a well-timed dive. But their att

I’m someone who values emotional connection far more than sexual intimacy. I like light gestures of affection hugs, holding hands even a peck on the cheek etc I express love mainly through acts of service making coffee, ordering takeout when someone is busy, or giving thoughtful gifts like books rather than grand gestures or expensive surprises. I’m not very emotional in the conventional sense, and people often tell me I seem cold or distant. Words of affirmation aren’t my love language; I prefer quiet, steady ways of showing care.

I value my personal space a lot and like living independently. I want a relationship where both people have their own goals and lives, and intimacy doesn’t mean losing ourselves in each other. I like cozy, comfortable connections rather than drama or high-intensity romance.

Before I realized I was asexual, I dated someone who dismissed my boundaries and constantly sought sexual intimacy. When I told him about my asexuality, he said I was “just misunderstood” no matter how much I tried to get him to understand , he also kept pressuring me into doing sexual stuff , even tho it was long ago I’m still traumatized and scared of dating again

I love how the cakes are cooked in small tins. Makes it so easy to save for later and eat them at a picnic! They are also pink, which makes them feel a little more special. 

Biscochito Cake: The biscochito flavor has fennel seeds in the creamy cake with a soft cinnamon flavor in the icing. It’s not too sweet and would be good with coffee or tea. 

Prickly Pear Cake: The prickly pear is the fruity flavor and the sweetest one. The prickly pear flavor is strong (in a good way) in the icing with a more traditional cake base. This would be a good celebration cake since it’s colorful and the flavor is bright. 

Red Chili Chocolate Cake: The red chile cake is a piece of art!! The chocolate cake batter is slightly more dense than the others with chocolate icing. I expected the icing to be spicy, but it was the cake! It starts off as a moist chocolate cake, then the spice kicks in. Not good for those afraid of spicy but very good for the New Mexican pallet. 🌶️ you can still taste the chocolate over the spicy flavor. 

I would and will buy again. I’d love to see these called sold at grocery stores. The serving size is great for a small, sweet treat!
