I live here with my partner and we have a great life but recently I have lost my job and I have a lot of time on my hands. 

I am making the most of this small (hopefully) gap in my career but don't have many friends in Edinburgh. I was wondering if there is anyone out there in a similar situation who would like to connect? 

I am 35, go to the gym, like to have a good steam/sauna down in Leith Victoria and have been walking a lot. I enjoy reading, travelling and very interested in politics and history but also pretty much a curious guy who enjoys new things/people.

I am interested in meeting interesting people of all ages, interests and from all walks of life. I am a good chatter and pretty open minded to exploring any group activities or even just a catch over a coffee. 

Safe my partner from my constant boredom and reach out. Please appreciate that this is a bit of an awkward ask so I would be grateful for kind responses only. Don't need reminding of some shit aspects of my life 🤣

If I don't send it on time, I have to pay them a couple of bucks - important: the amount increases for each 15-minute-block after the designated time! Otherwise I have no incentive to send the pic if I'm late by one minute, because I have to pay anyway.

I struggled badly with repeated use of the snooze button, sometimes for 2 hours or more. I tried everything I could find on the internet, nothing worked. So I was not a mild case, but this has solved the problem almost completely for me. It took about two weeks that were a little miserable and cost me quite a bit of money, but this finally trained me that staying in bed has immediate consequences. I still snooze once every morning because I enjoy waking up and having 15 more minutes to be in bed, but after that, I get up and make my coffee. Once in a while I have to pay a little money, but it's more than worth the investment. 

Pitfalls I experienced: Make sure that the pics are not saved on your phone. The temptation to send an old pic from bed and go back to sleep is irresistable. You could also make it a rule to include a note with the current date in the pic to prevent this.  
Also make sure the task is not too simple, or you will do it, send the pic and go back to bed, as I have done a couple of times. This will be individual, you have to figure out how much time you need to really wake up in the morning. Maybe your pic needs to be a full breakfast, or a selfie in the shower, or even a selfie outside in running gear. Whatever fits your life.

I'm sure this won't work for everyone, but some of you must be similar to me. Try it out! It has improved my life immensely at the cost of just a couple of bucks a month. ",1,1744553182.0,GetOutOfBed,0,1.0,False

Growing up, I have always had low self-esteem, I was bullied in school, had a hard time making friends because my family always had to move. Guys never took an interest in me and when I had my first and last boyfriend, he ended up cheating on me. I never dated anyone else after that. 

I think all these manifested in me even now that I’m already 35 years old. I felt like I always have to prove my worth. Couple that with how unhappy I am in life right now and having depression and anxiety about the future, LO came at a perfectly right time. 

Ever since my feelings for LO intensified, I always wanted to prove my worth to him. I am obsessed with wanting him to choose me or pick me or notice me. I wanted to spend more time with him that I almost confused it with love. 

**Grand Gestures:**

I gave him his favorite coffee last year, one I went great lengths to order because it wasn’t available locally. I spent a fortune on the international shipping.

I gave him his favorite candy, ordered it when he couldn’t find it in the market. When I went on a trip, I got him the most souvenirs and he loved the gift I got him. 

His birthday is in June and I’m already thinking of what to get him and planning to order something special. 

**Acting like a Girlfriend**

I’d keep asking and checking in on him when he’s sick.

I sent him paragraphs on Christmas and New Year’s ffs.

I always want to be updated on his life especially on the weekends and on his vacation days. Being left in the dark would send me into a spiral and left guessing where he would be. 

**Wanting to be in his presence and wanting him to notice mine**

I’d choose days when he’d be at the office because I wanted to see him and go home at the same time as him. 

I’d post instagram stories and set it to only him as the audience just to get him to notice me. 

I’d started taking interest in the things he likes just so I could have something to talk about with him. 

**Taking his kindness to mean I am special**

It’s because of his kindness that resulted in me having limerence towards him. It started last year with him making sure I got home safe when he couldn’t be there with me on a project we were both working on. 

He gave me a special gift last Christmas. I guess he just reciprocated when I gave him coffee. 

He always made sure I got home safe when we had an out of town project together, even going so far as to convincing me to take an Uber with him and do multiple stops to both our homes instead so I wouldn’t be left alone at the airport waiting for a ride. 

He asked me 2 weeks ago when I was on vacation when I was coming back and if I wanted to join him since he was also coming back from a work trip. We both needed to be at the office on that day for a Team Event. His plan was to take an Uber together to the office so that I don’t have to spend extra on my own Uber. 

Even though I was coming back a day early, I didn’t tell him and went to the airport instead the same day as him because again, I wanted to be in his presence. 

On that same day, I got a period accident and stained my pants. He offered me an extra pair of pants and didn’t leave my side until I was okay. Even took me home. 

**Wanting to reward his kindness for him to know I appreciate him**

Because of what he did 2 weeks ago, I wanted to give him something just to show my appreciation. 

Maybe if I do this or that, he’d finally see my worth and how great of a catch I am. 

Then I get confused, when his actions become inconsistent like when he stops replying or doesn’t even bother to text me for days. I then come to realize there’s nothing to be confused about because I was the only one fantasizing that I WAS SPECIAL IN HIS EYES because of what he did. 

I know he’s just being a kind person and he’d basically do the same for all the girls in our team. He once took one of our girl coworkers home because she got so drunk. I wasn’t special but it hurts to think about that and I was in denial. 

All these efforts and yet he is not the least bit interested in me. 

All these efforts and I don’t know if it’s genuine on my part or if I was doing it because I had a goal in mind, for him to see my worth. I feel so selfish.

I’ve asked myself several times, “would I be happy if he confessed he likes me?” And I can’t even answer it. 

I keep losing sleep over the thoughts of him, I get anxious when I don’t hear from him or when he doesn’t reply or read my texts. I’ve been spiraling more and more these days because of him. It’s become so unhealthy. My mood depended on his.

I’d “match his energy” thinking he’d miss me if I stay quiet and don’t respond to his next day texts after leaving me on delivered or read the whole weekend but get hurt when I don’t get the desired outcome. 

I’d make myself so busy to distract myself only to come home to a phone void of his messages and be disappointed. 

I get angry for being treated this way but what right do I have to be angry at him? He does not owe me anything. He didn’t give me hope. He didn’t lead me on. I was the only one who assumed and fantasized.

I feel angry that my LO gets to live his life without these devastating thoughts, that I’m the only one going through this. 

I’m even angrier and so frustrated at myself,  that if only I was more secure in myself and life, I wouldn’t look for validation in other people nor would I mistake any bit of kindness as flirting. Why am I like this??

And as if the universe is fucking with me, my LO is going to be my partner in two more projects. It makes me giddy but I know it’s also going to make it harder for me to accept the reality. 

My LE triggered me to seek therapy, that’s a plus but even with therapy, I still can’t seem to move on from the devastating effects of LE. 

I am aware how unhealthy it is to be fixated and obsessed with LO. I am aware how I shouldn’t look for external validation. I AM FUCKING EXHAUSTED, DRAINED AND FRUSTRATED OF FEELING THIS WAY and yet I can’t seem to walk away.",1,1744553106.0,limerence,0,1.0,False

The other night we were sexting and he made several comments like 'and you know how much there is' and 'think you can handle it?'. The thing is, through our previous sexual encounters I know that he is not well endowed....he's just about average....maybe. It's definitely not big. He is in his late 40's and a sportsman and there is no way he can think he's a big boy at all.

1jy8dt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jy8dt9/i_25m_asked_a_coworker_23f_out_she_turned_me_down/,"I [25M] asked a coworker [23F] out, she turned me down, I moved on but now all office think I’m obsessed and a stalker. What to do?","TL;DR: I asked a coworker out. She rejected me respectfully. I moved on and lost all interest in her. A few weeks later, I noticed some coworkers started acting differently toward me. Eventually, I found out they had been gossiping and now half the office wrongly believes I’m obsessed with her.

. . .

A few months ago, thinking my internship was ending, I asked a coworker out. We barely knew each other, just a few short conversations but from those, I thought she seemed cool, smart, and very empathetic.

She respectfully said no. I moved on.

Then, plot twist: I got hired full-time... and placed in her department...



At first, it was a little awkward, but we both stayed professional.

A few weeks after, I asked her if everything was okay between us because I was picking up weird vibes.

She smiled and said, ""Yeah, no problem!"" ...but her behavior didn’t match her words.



Later, I realized she wasn’t someone I even liked anymore. She turned out to be super immature, shallow, gossipy, childish, and fake, the kind of person who says ""yes"" to everything just to please people, but never follows through.

The crush faded pretty quickly after that... no feelings left.



Soon after, I noticed one of her friends (who used to be really friendly with me) started acting cold and condescending too.

I had a gut feeling something was off, so (not proud of this) I left my phone recording when I stepped away a few times (bathroom, coffee breaks) just to see if I was imagining things.

And guess what?

She, her friend, and a few other coworkers were gossiping about me behind my back. Very hard.

They twisted everything into a narrative that I was ""obsessed"" with her, and now half the department looks at me like I’m some kind of stalker, when in reality, I couldn’t care less about her anymore.

For example, on my first night shift, I asked her what time the company had arranged her taxi home, just to get an idea of how long it usually takes after the shift ends... but she misunderstood and thought I was asking because I wanted to spend more time with her at work, when really I just mind my own business.  
To make it even more contradictory, she even thought I was asking so we could ride together, which makes no sense at all, since she knows that we live in completely opposite directions.

Literally everything I do is interpreted as, ""Poor girl, he’s stalking you,"" when all I’m doing is my job, being polite with her (and all coworkers), and going home.



Now I’m stuck wondering what to do.

Talking to her would be pointless because she’d just lie and say everything’s fine again.

So honestly, I think the best thing is to completely ignore her — minimal contact, strictly work-related if absolutely necessary — and just focus on my job.

1jy8dmh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jy8dmh,Cannot take off work to go to GD class,"Hi friends!

I was diagnosed with GD last week, and my OB's office recommended I speak to a specialist.. only thing is, the ""specialist"" is a 2 hour class right in the middle of my work day. AND they only do it one day of the week, which is one of my work's heaviest days.. I've had to take a lot of time off to deal with baby things, and so that 2 hour class (which is realistically 3 hours total with drive time and everything) isn't seeming like it's going to happen.

So, in short, I cannot afford to take this extra time off, even if my job let's me do it. Plus, I'm not sure if it's going to cost me anything, because if it is... my $-49.91 bank account isn't getting me very far in that department. So I'd drive there, get turned away, and have lost an hour or whatever of work for no reason.

So, for now my diet has been largely experimental, for one of two reasons. One is for me to just be able to see what causes me to spike. Two is because, with my bank account in the state it's in, I have to either eat what I already have at home right now, or use coupons/rewards in order to feed me and my partner. At least until food stamps are refilled in a few days..

I've attached a snippet of my daily sugar checks and food log so you have an idea of how things have been so far. A couple of times I've eaten a meal that I normally would have (Arby's and Chipotle) just to see how my body reacted. The Domino's though, was a free pizza coupon I had to use.. 🫠

OKAY SO anyway, the real reason I wanted to make this post was to ask what everyone is shooting for numbers wise? My ""goal"" that you see at the top of that list is nothing from a healthcare provider, but common amongst what I've seen from watching a million tiktoks, reading reddit posts... I'm just curious in case I'm unable to see a specialist right away due to money/time concerns, I want to at least kind of start out on the right track.

I think this is happening now because we’re both graduating soon and I never really made any moves (for obvious reasons), I honestly just hoped she was a transbian or something and this could have just stayed platonic since no one really had our niche autistic interests in the program.

A mysterious patient walks into House’s clinic claiming strep throat. She's smart, confident, and meeting Dr. Chase for coffee. House is intrigued—and that never ends well. Thank you all who read it and for all the comments.

Let me guess—you're here for either a mystery rash or to ask if you’re dying. Either way, I've got ten minutes and a deep lack of sympathy.

WOMAN

Good afternoon. I think I have streptococcal pharyngitis. I have all the Centor criteria—tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and no cough. Uh, oh and fever. Well not right now because I took ibuprofen, but I have thirty… Oh, I don't do Fahrenheit. I just need a prescription.

Congratulations. You’ve officially diagnosed yourself better than 90% of medical students in New Jersey. I’d clap but the sarcasm would hurt my hands.

WOMAN  
I’ll accept a prescription instead.

HOUSE  
Where did you learn that? Google doesn’t give gold stars for using big Latin words.

WOMAN  
I was told to always treat all patients well, you never know if they have a PhD or not.

HOUSE

Treat all patients… and ibuprofen, not Advil or something (thinking). You are using a generic name instead of brand name. So, you probably work in healthcare. You are not a doctor, because you would prescribe an antibiotic on your own. On the other hand, you said you don't do Fahrenheit. Which means you are not from here. Based on the looks I would say… European? Maybe, Nordic or Irish the red hair is screwing me over.

WOMAN

No, I am Croatian, but I get Nordic, a lot. (smiles) Is this in any way connected with my diagnosis. You can examine me if you think I am wrong. (confused)

HOUSE

I don’t have to. You said you have a fever and I can see you starting to blush which means you either like me or the ibuprofen is subsiding. You haven’t cough since you came in and you are having trouble swallowing your own spit.

WOMAN

You really won’t examine me? And you got all that just from looking at me? What are you some kind of genius doctor?

HOUSE

I don’t want to brag, but since you pointed it out… Here, I’ll write you a prescription. You know how to take it anyways.

WOMAN

Thank you. (a bit confused at the interaction) Can you tell me where the cafeteria is? I’m supposed to meet with a friend, Dr. Chase, maybe you know him?

Last month I got food poisoning at a restaurant. I felt fine before I ate there for dinner and 2.5 hours later I was vomiting and had diarrhea. It was a rough night. Finally by about 5am I was taken to the emergency room due to the severe dehydration, relentless vomiting and shock my body was experiencing. 

They treated me with anti nausea medication and fluids. I got a catscan which revealed it had developed into colitis. They released me later that afternoon. 

I was left with a $350 copay, but I had other direct losses on top of that. I was scheduled to vend at an out of town convention — I’m an artist and I do about 15 conventions a year as an essential addition to my overall income.  (I got sick on a Thursday night and the convention ran from Friday thru Sunday). I also lost my table fee and my hotel fee on top of that—$594. All told I had nearly $1000 in direct losses. And that’s before adding in lost income. The last time I did this particular show that I missed I made $3700. So needless to say this ordeal cost me quite a bit.

When I reached out to the restaurant they were immediately defensive and rather dismissive of the impact this had on me. They said the best they can do is refund my meal. They suggested there’s no way to know how or what caused my illness, but the hospital sent me home with a packet that outlined treatment and an overview for food poisoning and colitis. And the timing/severity of it highly suggests it was food poisoning (I only drank coffee earlier that day.)

I’m wondering if I have a case against them. ",0,1744552637.0,legaladvice,4,0.3,False

\-You still use paper money?

\-What's wrong with it?

\-I'm thirty two!

\-You are? Sunscreen goes a long way.

\-Can I just get my coffee?

\-Sure. Hand over the papyrus, my pharaoh.

…

\-I can’t accept that.

\-Why not?

\-It's wrinkled.

\-I see nothing.

\-Sir, it's wrinkled. I cannot accept a wrinkled bill.

\-Fine, here we go.

\-Sir, this is the same wrinkled bill.

\-Where did you get this idea from?

\-It has the same wrinkle.

\-What wrinkle? I’ve just withdrawn it from the ATM, it’s even warm. Where do you see a wrinkle?

\-Right in the middle.

\-The middle?

\-Yes.

\-That’s just the fold of my wallet.

\-Potato, potahto.

\-From where do you expect me to get money, if not my wallet?

“You’re trans?” I said amazed sitting down across from her. There was a small table wooden table between us. I had been expecting my clone to look more like me, but she wasn’t it was the same black hair average height and everything but her hair was longer and she had softer face. She looked like she could be my sister. 

She smiled “yeah what can I say. Didn’t like being-“ she paused, the exact moment I felt a twinge in my stomach. Her smile faltered and turned into a that half smile I gave other people. Except her smile was pretty and well it felt comforting to look at. 

She nervously drummed her fingers against the table, we were in a lab but a normal one this room had been fitted to look like a living room, there were hidden cameras but we both were told to try and ignore them.
She asked the question. “Do you want to transition?” 
I looked at her. It wasn’t a question I liked thinking about and one I tried to squish whenever it came up. “even if I wanted to I couldn’t.”
“I think you were just lucky, it’s to late for me and well, I’m fine with being a man” 
She laughed not in a mean way but a laugh of understanding, or maybe her understanding the truth behind the lie, and I couldn’t help but smile too. 
“Alright alright I guess I was lucky” she tapped her forehead like she was supper smart the same way I do to make myself look cartoonish. 
“Well it isn’t all great, you sorta end up doing the whole ball and dance in the other direction” she sighed leaning back in her chair. 
“Sounds exhausting” 
“Yeah you would now” she laughed, and I scoffed we did some of the same memories after all, I knew better than anyone else. (We’d been cloned sometime during high-school.) 
“I’m glad you still have a sense of humor” I said wistfully. She leaned forward. Concern on her face like I was some abandoned puppy. 
“What happened to you?” 
“You know those dreams we have” I answered 
She nodded. There were dreams that felt prophetic or deeply insightful. They didn’t happen often but they sorta were checkpoints in in our life that marked a major change. 

“I had one, I offered up anything to get a good job and a stable life”  I explained 
“Did you get that” She asked curiously 
“Yeah I did” I leaned back in my chair… “but I’m empty now, all the work done to just to work everyday to get more cash do more nothing with” 
“Well if it makes you feel better I’m not doing much better” she smirked “I don’t have a job, stable income or even a place to live” she crosses her arms like she has something truly impressive. 
“Wow you are making me feel better, you know me pretty well” I said sarcastically, but she had actually made my heart feel less heavy. I guess my self depreciating jokes did work. 
“I’m a genius as you know, clearly I’m the smarter clone” 
I laughed. She smiled a genuine smile of victory on her face. 
“Eh but it’s not all that bad, I’m pretty good at illustrations now, like let me show you some of the stuff I’ve been making” she pulled out her phone and showed me incredible sketches of landscapes and cities. 
“Still don’t know how to finish a drawing” I observed laughing. I was really impressed by the artwork however I’d never been this good. 
“Yeah being trans doesn’t actually help with lineart” she shook her head in disappointment “I should really get a refund” 
“But I can tell you could, finish these if you wanted to… like your details in these sketches show you have a complex understanding of shading and perspective” 
“Yeah yeah well I didn’t make the deal you did in your dream, I still get bored easily” 
“And nothing is more boring then lineart” I said 
“Exactly my fabulous twin” 
I laughed. “Man I wish I had actually gotten to hang out with you all this time” 
She stuck out her tongue. “Well one of us wouldn’t exist then” 
“True” we had only gotten cloned to see how cloning would affect our life’s differently, it would be pointless if we stuck together like normal twins. 
“Are you acting” I asked 
“What?” She said, but she knew exactly what I meant 
“I know who your are you don’t have to pretend to be cute with me” 
She shifted in her chair “well I mean I just like being goofy, and you are a stranger”
“Ah yeah, I’m sorry idk why I said that” I apologize I liked her goofyness *I liked being goofy* it just didn’t come to me naturally anymore I guess. 
“Oh you must tell me” I said with renewed enthusiasm leaning forward “are you dating anyone?” I asked that with such enthusiasm I nearly didn’t recognize my own voice, sounded almost like her. 

She laughed “what? you want to share them with me XD” 
“I mean it depends if they are my type” I winked at her.  
“My type hasn’t changed sense childhood” 
“Ah fuck” I shook my head conceded “I probably shouldn’t meet them then, I would definitely get jealous” 
“I don’t mind sharing” she offered. I looked at her. I knew I was more polygamists than most but even this seemed like a stretch to me. 
“Your partner is interested in men?” I asked confused 
“Well no” she admitted 
“What you don’t think I’m manly enough for your partner “ I laughed 
“Listen king if you were perfectly straight I wouldn’t exactly be sitting here in a skirt now would I?” She pointed out. 
“Alright, fair point fair point” I raised my hands in defeat. “But to be honest I don’t know if I would even like your partner I’m not really in the LGBT community” 
She rolled her eyes. “You’ve always been in LGBT communities” 
“Yeah okay but like … idk gay communities” 
She knew what I meant, sorta upper middle class west cost LGBT people. 
“My partner not like that, he’s sorta like milk chocolate” she said. 
“I like milk chocolate but I don’t know what you mean.” 
“Like he’s” she bit her lip, in admiration with a dreamy look in her eyes. My mom could always tell when I liked someone and now I knew how. I looked like a wide eyed fish seeing the ocean for the first time. 
“You can just say he’s hot” I laughed 
“Okay yeah he’s definitely that but like he’s soft and listens and also confident” 
“He sounds pretty awesome” 
“Yeah like milk chocolate, coco or something” 
“Are you going to show me a picture?” I chuckled
She took out her phone and showed me a picture. He was pleasant to look at but wasn’t … didn’t make me instantly fall in love. 
“Trust me you would like him, just get to know him alittle and you’ll be head over heels” she said as she pocketed the phone. 
I laughed. “I’ve never dated a guy before, I don’t really think I like men that way” 
“You do” she said matter of factly 
I looked at her skeptically. “I - your a woman it’s different” 
She shrugged. “Maybe but I don’t think my sexual preferences really changed all that much” 
I leaned back in my chair thinking. She seemed to understand herself better than I do… no maybe understand was the wrong word more in tune than I was, but I guess I was more in control of my myself. 

She was looking up at the ceiling, probably thinking too, but if I had to guess it was much more colorful thoughts than mine or they were the thoughts I used to have of amazing worlds and artworks that I could create and explore and now it was just endless arithmetic and calculations in my head, proper logic to do my logical based job. I used to like numbers they had personalities and colors to them in my head at least. Nowadays it was just solve them as fast as you can no stories about how nine steals 6 from 60 to get 54. Just separate and multiply as fast as I can. At least that how it feels. I looked at her and she looked at me as we broke away from our own inner worlds. She tilted her head and studied me like a bird, I did the same in the opposite direction she giggled, I chuckled. “Mooo” I said randomly 
“Mheeeh” she answered 
“What are we?” I asked 
“A bunch of farm animals” she shook her head in mock shame


I leaned forward, but seeing her it was sorta like looking at a mirror more real.. and I want to feel that realness. Eye eyed me curiously. 

“Do you want to touch hands?” I asked. She nodded quietly  too embarrassed to look at each other we just stared at our hands as our fingers brushed. Then pressed together pressed palm to palm. We both leaned forward entangling our fingers into each other’s crevasses, it was like looking at your hands underwater an illusion but real at the same time. Her hands were close to my size but you could tell they were more feminine- her hands looked more delicate but her skin it felt the same way as touching my own. I think we both got lost in the experience before we noticed how close we had gotten our arms pressed against each other and our head’s nearly face to face. 
“Oh sorry about that” I apologize 
“It’s normal, you are me in a way” she pointed out 
“Yeah” still it felt taboo to do that with a .. version of myself that I hadn’t met before and a woman too. 
“Well you want to grab a coffee?” She asked sarcastically standing up. (We were probably free to leave the scientists got their data. )
“Oh definitely” I answered slyly, we both hated coffee. It was funny we both knew that about each other without even asking. 

We left and ordered some hot coco down the street (with me paying of course because broke ass version of myself couldn’t afford it)

Story down below.,"So i have an fdm printer. I usually use fancy filaments like silk etc and i don't usually paint them, but recently i got a new set of good paints(Vallejo and Green stuff world) I was discussing with a coworker and he told me he had a printed figure he needed to be painted. I told him if he was ok i'd bee happy to take a crack at it, but he needed to know i am not a painter(have never painted something like a figure).  
The result is the figure above. My coworker was passing by and i told him to come up for a cup of coffee. As we were relaxing a bit he saw the figure. Without saying anything he just dropped a 10E and told me i should be asking for commission, at the very least for materials and time, as he considered the paintjob quite good.  
Personally i don't think it's good enough for a commission, even a token one. I do it cuz i like it as a hobby, but the paints are pretty expensive(4-5E an 17ml bottle, and around 8-9 for the metallics), so i'd lie if i said i was not at the very least interested.  
How do you all handle it? I have gotten a few more 'offers' to paint/print but i usually turned them down. Should i be getting a token commission(just the material cost) or no? Is the one i painted so far good for a token commission of say. 3-5E? Keep in mind this is around 8 hours of work.",2,1744552280.0,3Dprinting,2,1.0,False
1jy83rx,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1jy83rx/assess_if_the_rwflame_portable_ice_maker/,Assess if the R.W.FLAME portable ice maker countertop lives up to its promises review.,"Using the R.W.FLAME Ice Makers Countertop with Handle has been a daily adventure in my kitchen. This compact ice maker has redefined how I deal with my incessant need for ice, especially when hosting gatherings or simply indulging in chilled beverages. It fits perfectly on my counter without dominating the space, which is a blessing for someone with limited kitchen real estate. At 11.2 by 11.2 by 8.6 inches, it's remarkably small yet performs like a heavyweight in the ice-making world. 

[Check R.W.FLAME Ice Makers Countertop with Handle price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0brz1l85s/)

One thing that caught me off guard was how incredibly user-friendly this machine is. A single button steers the entire operation. I could start the ice-making process, activate the self-cleaning mode, or even receive reminders via its prompt lights about water refills or ice basket clearance. Adding water and pressing a button is all that’s required to have ice in just about six minutes, and for someone who hardly has time to spare, this simplicity was delightful.

Its sleek black design meshes seamlessly with my other appliances, but what really earns it bonus points is the built-in handle. This handle makes the ice machine portable, which meant I could easily carry it to the patio during a barbecue. Several of my guests were amused, and in their words, it was a ""game-changing ice companion."" They were particularly struck by the speedy production of nine bullet-shaped ice cubes at once. Whether for iced coffee lovers or cocktail fans, this design is downright brilliant.

Quiet operation is something I value, especially during movie nights or late evening hours when the house is almost silent. I noticed the noise level never exceeded 42 decibels. Comparatively, it’s quieter than my refrigerator’s ice maker, and I couldn’t be more thrilled that this little machine didn’t disturb my peace.

Water temperature and cleanliness often dictate ice quality, and the bullet-shaped ice cubes have consistently remained dense and slow to melt. Using filtered tap water, as I do, enhanced the taste of the ice, ensuring none of that plasticky or metallic tang you’d expect from lower-tier machines.

Durability was one of my initial concerns, as portable ice makers tend to wear out quickly when used daily. Several months of use later, and this machine hasn’t skipped a beat. It’s like clockwork every day. With regular self-cleaning sessions, courtesy of the machine’s self-maintenance program, its performance hasn’t dwindled. To clean it, all I had to do was hold the ""ON"" button for five seconds. This function impressed me so much that when my neighbor inquired about getting an ice maker for her RV, I had no hesitation in recommending this mighty little gadget.

Looking at the warranty policies, there seems to be a standard protection level offered for this type of product. While it's not extraordinary, it’s reassuring to know some coverage is available. I’m not exactly worried about its longevity, given the robust build and self-cleaning feature that keeps it operational.

Several ice makers exist on the market, and I explored alternatives such as Frigidaire and Igloo models before locking in my decision. Comparatively, the portability of this machine and its self-cleaning edge set it apart. While some competitors offered slightly larger water capacities, they failed in compactness and noise mitigation. On the downside, this model does occasionally signal “red alerts” frequently after a batch of ice is made, reminding you to clear the basket or refill water. It’s not a dealbreaker, but something like that could frustrate individuals with a “set it and forget it” mindset.

The cost-efficiency of this ice maker is one of its standout qualities. For its size, speed, and capabilities, it delivers excellent bang for the buck. In my case, I’ve already saved on buying multiple bagged ices, meaning this little gem has practically paid for itself in just a few months of ownership. Rarely does an appliance recoup its value so quickly, making this an excellent deal for anyone who entertains often or consumes large amounts of ice.

About six months ago, I started walking to a new coffee shop on my way to work. One morning, I noticed this older man sitting on the same bench every day, always reading a newspaper (a real one — like, ink and everything).

We made eye contact once, I gave a polite nod, and he gave this tiny salute back. It made me smile.

The next day, I did the same thing. Nod. Salute. Every day after that, it became our little thing.

One morning, I was running late and didn’t think he’d be there. But when I passed by — slightly out of breath — he looked up, smiled, and just raised his coffee cup like a toast. I returned the salute.

It sounds silly, but this 3-second interaction with a stranger has become this small, perfect part of my routine. We’ve never spoken a word, but it feels like a mutual respect thing now.

 When Baku's past is shown, it mostly feels like he keeps winning cause he has luck and able to read his opponents(which realistically cant happen)(The Oyster gamble and when after he wins he jumps off a bridge and is able to survive to land on a truck). Even from the perspective of Souichi, I never understood how souichi didn't catch on what Baku ""had"" that kept him winning big. He just took him as his rival to surpass

When the first STL happens, we are shown that Baku had a very weak gamble because it was a plain gamble(Who has more overall power currently, which also didn't had mind games, involved in it). Thats why I felt that Souichi felt that this gamble was boring and decided to spare his life cause it didnt feel worth it.

Then we see different type of gamblers like Kaji, who mostly believes in High Risk High Reward gambles and sometimes, Kaji doesnt seem to have a plan on how to win with a full-proof plan, whereas his opponents already have some kind of mechanism to cheat and win. Kaji tries to gamble till his last breath, where his opponents thinks that there must be some kind of trickery involved, Kaji turns this doubt of opponent to his strength and somehow manages to completely dominate this position and win the gamble.

Then there are gamblers like Fukurou where a lot of his gambles are mostly unclear but he too seems like a gambler with a lot of power.(Also Sutegama is also unclear cause he felt more of a motive-based person and not a person who gambles for thrills)

Then finally comes Kiruma Souichi, whose viewpoints about gambling changes on how he views his perfectionism. Kid souichi watched the interview of his late mother, and he believes in this thing called destiny, which is mostly prevalent throughout the story as his overly calm demeanor and overconfidence in himself like in the abandoned mine arc, and the coffee creamer game where he directly tells Kidou that he cannot win. He believes he is destined to win but somehow manages to not get enough arrogant that it backfires him. But He soon wasnt able to keep his calm demeanor during the Finale of STL, where his memory returns and then realises that this perfectionism that he is being chasing will help to a certain point, but after all giving his 100%, he realises that he must gamble or he will lose(Even Baku pointed where he asked souichi about his experience on gambling in STL)

Till this point Baku had been kept winning. He doesnt believe in Power, Luck, Destiny, High Risk-High Reward. It mostly seems he just wants to gamble and this gambling obsession feels mostly open to readers on what they feel. 

But Whats actually making Usogui win?

His Allies-mostly no, cause from start even before baku meeting souichi, Souichi mentions that he was always alone,(Even Kyara was just a referee for him and just wanted to see how long will he keep winning)and baku was already a member of Kakerou(which is very less compared to the world)

His Obsession to just gamble- perhaps, but this is not a way to ""win"" a gamble 

Whats the main motive/reason/ Baku pursues these bleak possible plans like leap second to get somehow the thrill of gambling?",3,1744551765.0,Usogui,1,1.0,False

... I have a habit of saying these things out of care and I'm scared it might annoy people.

It's hard being someone who's too affectionate - I tend to get swept up by my feelings and give too much, usually ending with them being overwhelmed or even worse - turned off.

I still hope and pray na there's someone willing to share my kind of love with me. I want to feel important to someone. Gusto ko ma-experience maging favorite person. Gusto ko makakilala ng taong excited na makilala ako as much as I am excited to know them.

My goal with this long post? I want to know where that red string leads.

Rei’s heart pumped through her chest. The heavy purifier stretched her arms taut with its weight, every stride yanking on her very bones. Path lights blurred in her vision, the battle blood in her veins melding her peripherals into black. She hardly noticed the few females by the fire giving her wild looks. She dashed straight through the cold toward the third dormitory, not even bothering to follow the trail of heaters.

The building’s door flew open, her shoulder taking the brunt of the force. She barreled through the mess hall’s tables, eyes locked onto the doorway that led to the shared restroom held between the two buildings. Her footsteps were deafening and her goal was blinding.

*“Rei!”* shouted Chef from behind the wide kitchen counter, confusion sewn into his admonishment. *“What are you doing with that?!”*

The brief flicker of pup-like embarrassment she felt from being chastised by an adult was short-lived, suffocated under blistering distress. *“Urgent orders from Tracy! The star-sent are imposters!”*

*“Imposters? Whatever do you mean—”*

A loud ‘*thud*’ of the shut door cut off any conversation. The tiled hallway echoed with her every move as she skidded around the row of mirrors and sinks, her grip on the purifier beginning to hurt.

The fisherwoman stood at the far end of the long row of showers, pressed up against the wall and surrounded by the two imitators. Her eyes were wide, and her hands were held out in defense.

Shock crashed into Rei, her feet struggling to keep her upright as she dashed ahead. An extra pair of hands brought the tip of the flamethrower up with a heave, jabbing it in the false creatures’ direction. *“Fisherwoman! Leave at once!”*

The female was frozen in place, unmoving from the orders. The star-sent-masquerading beings turned around to reveal their facades with a faint flicker of motion underneath their faces’ moist skin.

“Now what do you think you’re doing with *that*?” the ‘O’hara’ asked pointedly, her nose crinkled into a sneer.

Rei could not catch her breath. *“Y-You are false mimics of the deity-sents! You must be—”*

*“What in the Mountain Lord’s name are you doing?!”* Chef yelled from behind her, his swift stride closing the distance before she could even react. He stomped right in front of her and pushed the purifier’s end away from the disguised creatures. 

She fought against his effort, the singular female standing behind the monsters preventing the trigger’s pull. *“I am clearing our settlement of these heinous beings! Fisherwoman, you must leave!”*

The pink-skinned male squinted at her. *“Monsters? Have you lost your mind, Juvenile? All this mech piloting and playing star-sent ‘video games’ has turned you mad!”*

Rei’s heart pounded in her ears, a snarl ripping from her maw. *“I have not lost my mind. I have the evidence that these are no star-sent! These are corpses inhabited by vile things! Tracy entrusted me to this task!”*

He recoiled, his eyes wide and his maw open in shock. *“No! This is no way to treat these blessed star-sent. I cannot fathom what delusion makes you think of them as monsters! What manner of influence has induced these thoughts in you?”*

She struggled to keep up with her own racing mind, barely piecing together the words of her intent through her distress. *“I have told you already! They have only told lies of their backstory! They were never in the southern area, nor did they have tools… W-We saw it on the drone footage! Only a fleshy being came from the south!”*

*“Tools? Footage? Flesh? Are you even thinking about what you’re saying?”* He reached forward again, forcefully taking hold of the heavy purifier in an attempt to pull it out of—

‘*Click. FWOOSH.*’

Blue flames engulfed the room in their hue. A searing heat was thrusted into her skin, forcing her to flinch. She dropped the weapon to the floor with a ‘*thud*,’ stopping it as soon as it started. Her eyes reopened quickly, finding black scorch marks left on half of the wall and fire licking along the shower stall curtains.

She let out a shaky exhale at seeing the fisherwoman looking unharmed and sitting down by an unaffected portion of the wall. Chef was similarly on the floor, cowering away. She reached out to him with a pang of guilt biting at her chest, but she was stopped.

Loud footsteps berated her ears in the silent aftermath.

She whipped her head around. The two imitators sprinted down the bathroom hallway and through the slick floor, turning toward the second dormitory. She made to grab the purifier and pursue them once more, but hesitated at seeing the one who had looked after her for the past few months struggling to get to his feet.

A scowl crossed her face. She had matured enough.

The weapon’s grips were still cold. Rows of sinks, lines of mirrors, and a bewildered Akula passed her by before the juvenile left the bathroom in a sprint. There was a commotion within the second dormitory, her ears taking in star-sent vocalizations as she dashed across the stone floor.

She was quickly bathed in warm lighting, the various woodworking and hobby tables in the next room insisting she hold her weapon close in fear of ramming into them. She rounded the central stairwell and into the main hallway of the building, the noises and yelling getting louder as she approached the main lobby.

Several settlers were gathered on two opposing halves of the leather seating by the hearth. Rook, two miners, and the imitators stood by the wall, with the head harvester holding two hands in front of ‘Trey,’ while Tracy pointed a finger right at them from the opposing side.

The script-keeper jogged into the room from the opposite doorway at the same time Rei did, holding the portable scanner from the med bay.

Their entrance into the dimly lit room silenced the argument for a long, drawn-out second. She witnessed the scowls on the imitators’ faces and Rook’s firm stare falter at the sight of her heavy purifier. The two harvesters on the side stood with their leader but slowly sunk further back into the wall, away from the flamethrower and the argument. Tracy’s shoulders loosened ever-so-subtly.

The artificer gestured to the elder Malkrin, continuing adamantly. “Look, if you don’t believe the *fucking footage* of them *not being there*, then we’ll just scan—”

“You only had drones out for a few hours. We were investigating the bridge since early in the morning!” O’hara shouted back, pointing back behind herself.

Rei crossed the distance and stood tall beside her trusted ally, unsure of what to do. She caught the technician’s eye and nodded. Nothing of the argument needed to be explained.

Tracy squinted. “And how do *you* know about the drone footage I showed Rook in private? The fact that they were out for only ‘a few hours?’”

The orange-haired mimic shook her head incredulously. “We saw them coming here? We only went up north because we saw that was where they came from!”

“And what were you doing in there without any tools or bags or *anything*?” the Artificer jabbed, taking a step forward.

*“Must we argue like this? We cannot make any hasty decisions. It would be proper to wait until Chief Harrison returns to determine your accusations,”* Rook responded for the imitators, holding out her hands in a failed attempt to stymie the staggering heat in the room from growing.

Tracy shot her arms out wide, nearly hitting the juvenile mech pilot. “What part of *mimic* do you not understand? Those aren’t fucking people! Why would you let them roam free?”

*“These are animals of the mainland,”* the script-keeper added sharply, placing the scanner on the coffee table between the still steaming teas and half-drawn mockups for future rock carvings—it was a late night for the harvesters. She furrowed her brows at the miners. *“There is no reason to trust them.”*

“Animals? You’re callin’ us *animals*?” the dark-skinned imitator growled, rolling up his sleeves. It stepped out in front of Rook’s placating arms, approaching the technician with malicious intent. “Mama said ta never start no fights, but now if yer gonna threat’n me, I might as well—”

‘*click,*’ the purifier’s ignition lighting stopped the creature in his tracks. Rei stared it down, wholeheartedly ready to turn it to cinders in an instant.

“Harrison was completely right. I thought you followed him,” Tracy remarked through a simmering glare. She did not back down one bit from the mimic, firmly holding the drawn line between the two parties.

*“Of course I do! I would lay down my life for his vision!”* Rook snapped back, her eyes aflame with fervor. _“However, these star-sent have offered a completely reasonable explanation for everything. I do not wish to make any mistakes. The Creator may find use for them, or he might agree with you. Until **he** speaks, I shall not take action.”_

“You don’t need to ‘take action.’ We’re going to scan them to prove if they’re human. If it comes up as inconclusive, then we’ll go from there,” the Artificer stated sternly, stepping up to the coffee table and pulling the scanner out of its socket.

The creatures did not say anything in response. Their faces went flat in stark contrast to Rook’s conflicted frown. They suddenly shared none of the anger they wore before. It was… *eerie*. Their facades of emotion were reduced to nothing, losing almost any and all resemblance of the star-sent with uncomfortably… *hollow* eyes and completely detached visages. The fabricated soul they mimicked was completely gone. No manner of evidence was needed when they appeared this *empty*.

Rei’s trigger finger trembled. Only the latching wraps of her subservience held it still.

Tracy began to give out stern orders in the absence of any resistance. Neither Rook nor the imitators said anything, but the head harvester chose to stand close behind the Artificer, inspecting her every move. She voiced a protest against the idea of tying the false star-sent to the couch. It was short-lived when the female creature agreed.

“If she wants to prove us wrong so bad, so be it. It’s not going to change the *outcome*,” the female imposter touted emotionlessly.

There was something in the way it said ‘outcome’ that sent a cold chill down Rei’s spine. Every word was detached from any feeling, yet that one seemed… venomous… and almost *conceited*. It almost seemed willing to be tied up.

Carbon fiber cables were wrapped around the large furniture, locking the two creatures and their arms to the backrest tight enough to prevent any movement. They stared at the actual star-sent with black eyes, unsettlingly following her move about the room in sync.

Finally, Tracy had everything set up. Some of the settlers had come down to inspect the commotion from their hobby groups or their bedrooms, but every one was sternly turned away. Most were already too far in the grasp of slumber to enter.

Rei was set up to the side of the couch, the flamethrower’s tip primed to char half the room with a click. She took in slow breaths, trying to calm her heartbeat, assuring herself of her purpose. Her gaze met with the script-keeper’s. She was right beside the mech pilot, confidence welling within the Juvenile from the UKM held within the elder’s talons.

A loud ‘*beep*’ broke through the silence. Tracy picked up the hand-held scanner, her breathing shaky and her shoulders stiff. All eyes were on her.

She took a step toward the tied-up things. They sat there, completely motionless; not even their chests moved. Fixed faces bored into her.

Rei resettled her footing, swallowing nothing from her dry maw. Tracy’s boot clacked against the stone floor once more, hesitancy in her stride. Another inhale.

The Artificer held up the device, her fingers clenched around its grip. Another exhale.

The final step was slow, only brought on by the momentum of the last. Tracy hovered just outside of their reach and pressed a final button.

Everything was dead still. The room was cold; Rei’s bones felt even colder. She wanted to rotate the plaguing stiffness out of her shoulder, but even the mere thought of moving an inch terrified her. It was as if her heart stopped beating at all.

The Artificer glacially raised her hand up, every motion racked with wavering confidence. She leaned in closer to the expressionless O’hara.

The mech pilot drew in a quick breath, pressure building in her veins and muscle tensing. A quiet but high-pitched groan from her weapon shocked her, forcing her ears to bolt up on end.

Yet Tracy did not notice. She jabbed the device to the creature’s chest, waved it for a split second, and jumped back. The scanner’s green glow illuminated her face as she scoured the results to find…

“…Inconclusive?” the technician whispered, glaring into the screen.

“**Try again**,” “**Try again**,” the mimics stated in complete unison with their flat intonation, sending a flurry of shivers down Rei’s frills.

“W-What…” Tracy stuttered, taking a step back. She tripped on the coffee table, falling back onto it.

The creatures trembled under their wraps. It started slowly at first, but their shaking grew and grew until the furniture began to rattle underneath them. Repulsive nodules and veins bubbled up from beneath their skin.

Rei’s breath hitched, and her eyes widened, incapable of looking away from the swelling, spreading masses.

Their bodies stretched and pulsed like fetid strings of sap gurgling under an unseen heat, barely holding onto their original forms, which ripped apart to reveal the glistening sinew underneath at every seam. One’s chest unfolded down its center, letting a flurry of tendrils flail out into the air with an alien wail that reverberated through her chest. Several tentacles spat out toward the ceiling and wrapped around the support beams. It heaved itself up and out of the couch.

Several gunshots blew out Rei’s ears. They rattled and punctured the red meat, but the masses kept *moving*. More appendages shot out, yanking and maneuvering the conglomeration of teeth, flesh, and skin around.

“Rei!” Tracy screeched. She crawled over the table, but pink tendrils wrapped around her calves, dragging her kicking and screaming across the wood.

The mech pilot jammed the trigger down to—‘*tink*.’

*It did not fire.* She tried over and over again; it would not budge! The star-sent’s form drew closer and closer to the creature.

Rei glared down at the weapon. Her talon was not even in the trigger guard! How did it slip out?! She tried to force it in again, but it slipped out the side.

“REI!” Tracy shrieked again, the yell collapsing Rei’s chest into a wheeze.

She jammed her digit back in, yanking the ignition down to—

‘*FWOOOOOOOOOOOM*.’

Fire seared up and into the air with the recoil, engulfing the ceiling until she could wrangle the massive jet of pure flames. She clenched her teeth and thrust the barrel down and forward, baring the scorching heat that scalded her frills and singed her eyes. It was impossible to keep her vision; faint squints squeezed in glimpses of light amongst the desiccating, blue flow.

Unnatural bellows shook the ground she stood on. They drilled into her ears and compressed her skull.

But she kept *burning*.

It howled and flailed its tentacles in the air, the mass falling back down to the charred couch, back into the fire where it melted and crumbled.

Cold water dribbled onto her skin from the sprinklers above, other droplets hissing as they made contact with the ground. The entire world was black in comparison to the white-hot flames taking up a fourth of the room.

She pulled her talon off of the trigger and stumbled back. She coughed over and over again, doubling over as her eyes watered.

*“Rei! Another!”* the script-keeper yelled, gripping her shoulder and pushing her torso upright.

A finger pointed toward an unsymmetrical jumble of meat and tendrils scampering down the hallway in a flurry. She forced air through her dried throat and sprinted ahead, trailing it and unleashing a fury of scorching rage, clenching the trigger down for several long seconds.

The fire burnt away what it could over the stone bricks, leaving a black mark on the floor in its wake. Soot and ash were swallowed up by the trickling water, flowing through the masonry.

She dragged herself back to the lobby, her eyes scanning every wall for flickers of flesh.

…But there were none. There was only the crackle of the raging fire and the hiss of secondary extinguisher systems layering the lobby in white foam. The flames sizzled and sputtered with their final smoky exhales, leaving Rei to take in the aftermath.

Black cinders mixed with the froth over where the couch used to be. Faint structures resembling bones were piled in the mass. A visible skull stood out as dark soot amongst the white, cracked in half with clusters of teeth on the separation points.

Those were never star-sent. She stared at them for who knew how long, enough to the point her stomach stopped churning.

Rei turned to face the others. Rook patrolled the room, wielding a kukri and looking for flesh, while the script-keeper silently held her hands together, offering a prayer in her mind. Tracy sat against the wall by the main entrance, using her sweatshirt to coarsely scrape her calves clean of any residue.

The mech pilot approached the technician, who noticed, speaking up between grunts and heavy breaths. “Fucking… knew it… Good job for… taking care of those… things…”

Tracy had returned to her placid state. Rei frowned and let her purifier drop to the floor. Her jaw finally unclenched after a deep breath. The sudden exhaustion and loosening of her muscles watered her intent down into a quiet but respectful timbre. *“We have indeed prevailed… even though the others ridiculed us.”*

The artificer threw her sweatshirt to the side and pulled her knees to her chest, resting her chin on them. “Mmm, yeah. I guess… I’m tired… I don’t know how Harrison does it.”

Rei took a seat beside her, crossing her legs. She blankly stared into the floor, watching the foam bubbles grow and pop, drowning out any noise. Her entire body was held stiff, but slowly began to decompress, letting her spine relax against the wall further and further.

Others quickly stormed into the room. Some had guns, others had hand-held extinguishers. Their intent was loud and pierced her mind. She did not pay them much mind. She was too tired.

But, she could not help but feel proud. The smallest smirk curled along the edges of her maw.

Respect and success.

It was a warm feeling…

\= = = = =

Harrison gripped the steering wheel loosely, letting the slow hums of the truck fill the night drive’s silence. There was nothing to say. Half of his mind was kept on the headlight-illuminated ground ahead and the other was… *lost*.

Everything felt like a blur after that first interaction with the flesh monster. He explored corridor after corridor, venturing farther into the concrete maze. The colony only dropped scraps in their wake. Everything was gone by the time he was left to walk in their ruins, leaving him numb by the time he entered that last room. All the frustration, dread, and anxiousness was gone, replaced with a bone-deep weariness. He had seen enough of the same.

But that left the perfect hole in his mind’s defenses. He wasn’t phased by the charred, malformed skulls or bones several times larger than expected.

It was the monstrosity of myomer tentacles and beady eyes that ripped him out of his stupor. It laid lifeless, torn apart and corroded in most places, but it was so… *unnatural*, alien in a way he could never describe. No one besides Central Martian Intelligence would create something so unsettling. Squid-like limbs, a spidery face, and insectoid arm-mandibles beneath its disk head weren’t… *normal* for automatons.

In time, the group had convinced themselves of its permanent inactivity. The Malkrin weren’t nearly as uneasy in its presence as he was. They were instead reminded of a passive sea creature.

He and Oliver climbed the pile of metal and bones to its head. They found nothing accessible and decided to test the synthetic muscle. The first shock proved there was a good chunk of harvestable material, so they continued with the full discharge—the amount of myomer in a singular appendage would have been enough to make an entire cargo mech.

The tentacle flailed, its mechanisms whirred to life, and it began to move. Harrison scrambled back with Oliver, preparing his squad for anything to happen.

He was not expecting it to speak. Not in vocals, nor in his *mind*, exactly like the Malkrin. Not to mention the things it said. ‘New High Spirits had fallen’? ‘High Spirits’ was the name of the colony ship. Who were the ecologists? Why was he a ‘Grandmaster’? What did ‘M.A.X.’ stand for? What was the infestation? Who was the final priest? Why was the last part of his speech so distorted?

More questions. That was all he had at that point.

The Malkrin heard it all too. They didn’t ask him about it; they knew he was just as lost as they were. Everyone was enraptured in the same sense of wariness. The settlers were at least lucky to have an extra layer of ignorance over the subject; he sank further into dread.

The team didn’t bother with further setting up camp that night. They hiked back up the hill in the dark of night, and they loaded up the ‘Mountain Eater’ drill, the AI core, several mining components… and what was left of the exterminator’s head.

Harrison drove away from the warehouse and launch site, not even bothering to read the data chip he had picked up.

He didn’t like how the radiation levels rose. He didn’t like how the fungus seemed to grow toward him along the concrete. He didn’t like the subtle spread of the clear ooze along the floor. He didn’t like how many malformed bones lined the hallways… And he certainly did not like how many of them resembled humans.

His goals had been achieved, and he had possible answers in tow. No matter how many questions still lingered, he didn’t need to see any more than he had.

\- - - - -

Harrison wasn’t expecting anyone to be awake by the time he returned. It was just about midnight when the truck trundled back through the settlement gates. He was halfway through doling out how he wanted the goods brought back into the workshop when he spotted a few Malkrin sitting around the bonfire.

All he had was a quick inhale to revitalize his weary limbs. The engineer cracked the vehicle door open, feeling the night’s cool breeze wash over his face as he quickly strode over to the figures. The expedition team followed shortly behind him.

Rook, Akula, the elder, and Tracy sat on the ground around a raging flame, sitting on the grassless dirt a mere two meters from it. They all noticed him arrive, slowly standing up on weary legs to meet him half way. Their strides were lethargic, which made sense given the time of night. Akula stretched her arms out wide in a casual yawn. It eased his anxiousness, but the restless frown on Rook and the script-keeper’s faces didn’t.

A pip of warm energy sparked in his chest when he locked eyes with Tracy… but she held no emotion on her face. She quietly looked him up and down as the two parties stopped.

He cleared his throat, taking his helmet off and nestling it in his arm. A hundred ways of greeting them came to mind and a dozen laid on the tip of his tongue, but none came out. His eyes were caught by the technician’s arms and the subtle red scrapes along them. She’d been scratching them… She was stressed.

Her brows slowly tented in a drawn out crumbling of inner emotions. Her beautiful, dark eyes glistened with accumulating liquid as she took a hesitant step forward. The frail wall of her impassive aura cracked and shuttered with each breath. She inhaled sharply… and then again, struggling to hold in a dam of sobs as she scanned him over and over again, almost in disbelief.

The sight tightened his chest, compressing it painfully. So many questions danced around his mind. He unconsciously stepped forward himself. His lips fought their own battle, uncertain if he wanted to frown at the woman falling apart right in front of him or smile that he was seeing her at all.

He wrangled the edges of his lips up. He had no idea why or how she was brought so low, but by God, he wouldn’t let her seep any further.

“Oh…” she sniffled, tears streaming down her cheeks. Every structure holding her up until that moment broke. “Oh, Harrison!”

The wavering woman held out a meek hand, her legs trembling… and he took it. He softly pulled her into his embrace and held her tight, ensuring she wouldn’t fall. Her tender warmth penetrated right through his frigid armor. The easing scent of campfire and the lemon shampoo on her hair cut away at the strings holding his entire body so tight.

A moment of solace burned through all his tension, dread, and responsibility for a satisfying moment until Tracy’s sob wracked through him, reminding him he wasn’t the only one with internal struggles.

She dug her face into the polymer pouches on his chest; her soft cries and words were muffed beyond recognition, but he only held her tighter. Her strength slipped right out from under her, falling away as she nearly fell out of his arms.

Tracy was reduced to liquid within moments. Her faint grip on his sides only worked to bury herself into him, any act of gravity on her body suddenly being relegated to him. That was fine.

Harrison snaked an arm underneath her own and reached up behind her neck. Delicate circles and applied pressure helped ease deep exhales from her… then lighter breaths… then…

She fell completely limp after a short minute, taken fully into slumber. He tapped her a few times to no success in rousing her. He didn’t bother shaking her, though. If she was this exhausted…

He let Tracy down toward the ground enough for him to swap hands. She was easily pulled up into a bridal carry with her arm loosely hung over his neck and her head nestled into his shoulder. She was a bit lighter than he last recalled.

Harrison stood up fully, finally returning to the real world. No one else had spoken yet, so he did the honors, looking straight at Akula, and sternly addressing her.

“What happened?”

\- - - - -

The fireplace was hot, almost uncomfortable to Harrison. He sat on one of the oversized chairs of the first dormitory’s lobby area, exchanging glances with Akula, Rook, and the script-keeper. Tracy sat on his lap, still sleeping with her chin nestled atop his shoulder and playing the role of human-furnace. Shar stood beside him, her tail comfortably wrapped around his legs, sapping away at the excess heat and anxiousness flooding into him.

All he could do was let out a pent-up sigh. The guilt returned with his subsequent inhale, unshakably sticking to his chest. Where did he even start? With how he hadn’t prepared them for something he never could've predicted? That the mimics’ charred remains were unsettlingly similar to the thing he found in the launch facility? How Rook’s unyielding faith in him almost became their downfall? He couldn’t say any of that. Not now.

Thankfully, it was the head harvester that broke the stagnant silence and pressure of the room. She rested her elbows atop her thighs, staring into him with her brows furrowed in a steadfast expression, yet the guilty limp of her ears told him she felt otherwise. *“I would like to apologize for my insubordination, Creator… I believed outsiders by the simplest falsehoods, and allowed them access though our stalwart walls under the guise of a false authority—all when you had stated yourself that those vile… puppets… were long dead.”*

He simply raised a brow. She already profusely apologized earlier in her own way of assuring that ‘such would never occur again.’ Why was she repeating herself?

The veteran miner looked down at the woman in his arms with huff, a glint of admiration reflecting in her dulled eyes. *“I also failed the Artificer. She vehemently provided proof against what I thought was the truth, but in my dismissal of her aptitude, I chose to believe the imposters. Your Tracy… She held the creatures at bay, sniffed out their lies, and led us into their extermination. I am ashamed that I never believed her capable, but she had faced what I could not. There is a strength within her I never considered… I should have trusted her… I should have trusted your faith in her.”*

Shar’s tail tightened around his calves. He held up a hand to stop her from chastising the harvester.

Rook swallowed, her eyes never faltering from his. *“I take responsibility for this incident.”*

*“A shame… truly,”* Akula remarked arrogantly, absently looking at her talons.

The Elder scoffed, staring pointedly at the overseer. *“You were nowhere to be seen during Tracy’s investigation.”*

*“And yet it was my squad who cleaned up your mess,”* the troublemaker shot back.

“Zip it,” Harrison ordered in a sharp whisper. The others froze in their seats, settling back into place in embarrassment.

He drew in another breath, easing himself by tenderly kneading Tracy’s back. He stopped when he noticed the subconscious action. A different kind of guilt grabbed at him, reminding him he was only digging himself further down *that* rabbit hole.

“I don’t think a pointing finger or blaming anyone is necessary. I have plenty of thoughts on how all of this could have been avoided, but the bottom line is that no one could have foreseen… *this*.” He vaguely gestured to the world around him before letting his hand fall back to the chair. 

Those things took the bodies of his dead coworkers and puppeted them with some semblance of their memories. There’s no telling what limit there is to the bullshit on the mainland… He wasn’t even sure what would work as a guaranteed countermeasure either. Maybe there’s something to do with how they smelled wrong or were too hot… Maybe he should have recognition for anyone he knew was real in the drones or some other way.

He rubbed his eyes, his hand minutely trembling under the last twenty-four hours’ trials. “Alright. We’ll be scanning everyone first thing in the morning just in case, but I doubt it’ll reveal anything. Going forward, Tracy and I will be putting some effort into countermeasures, starting tomorrow. Beyond that, we’ll just have to move on and begin working on the blood-moon defenses and start employing our new mining tools. As disturbing as today may have been, there are still bigger things on the horizon.”

*“That is most reasonable, Creator,”* Rook affirmed with a tired nod.

The others agreed with few words. He sympathized with their weariness, offering a frown. “If that’s all the information we have, then I won’t keep you here any longer than need be. You’re all free to get some shut-eye.”

The big girls seemed to deflate with their own respective exhalations, each slowly getting up and shuffling away to their respective bed. None of them lived in the burnt dormitory, but even if so, the damage had been repaired as soon as possible—no one was asleep then for the construction to wake them.

Harrison watched the script-keeper depart. She offered a final wave goodnight before the door shut behind her, leaving just the low crackle of the fireplace. He sunk back into the chair and rested his head back into it, decompressing for a moment.

“Shar, can you hand me my data pad?” he requested lazily, rubbing the streaks of soreness out from his face.

The hand-held computer pressed softly into his held-out palm. He read over the two short messages from Oliver that confirmed the truck’s unloading was completed and that they were waiting for his next orders in the workshop. He quickly responded with ‘SLEEP’ as their next command.

His guardian kneeled, lowering her chest down to his level to catch his attention. Her telepathic words were light, melting into his weary mind like butter. *“Shall we adjourn to our chambers for the evening? You appear quite exhausted, dearest.”*

She placed one of her massive mitts on his knee, pleasantly rubbing his lower thigh with a talon. He hummed in thought for a moment. Tracy unconsciously clenched him and mumbled something unintelligible.

Right, he should probably get her to bed first before he even considered what he wanted to do next. He grunted, regaining his footing on the ground and digging his hands underneath the technician’s supple thighs before hoisting her up. Her arms were comfortably and loosely nestled on his shoulders, offering some stability.

Shar stood up beside him, ready to follow. He frowned, whispering. “I think I’ll just be bringing Trace to bed. Cera’s drink hasn’t left my system just yet… You can join her, of course.”

The giantess raised a brow, unimpressed. *“I am not leaving your side this evening.”*

He stopped himself from shrugging for Tracy’s benefit, instead giving her a weak smile. The two of them left the building and walked through the series of powered-off heaters with a quiet pace. The lighting eased him. It was familiar and whole, completely different from the sparse flashlights deep underground, scattered through what remained of a dead colony.

This place was built by him and the people he had come to appreciate more than he would have ever thought. The idea brought him comfort.

Still, he couldn’t shake the thin film of dread that spread across every thought of his. He wanted to talk to Tracy about everything he’d seen and hear what she thought of it all. He almost didn’t want to bring it up to her for her sake, but he knew that, deep down, she was just as curious and terrified as he was. She would understand… She was the only one who *could*.

Harrison felt embarrassed for how selfish it sounded, but he hated suffering alone. It was like she said a couple of weeks prior: ‘shared sorrow is half sorrow.’

His legs carried him up the stairs and toward the bunk room. The warm upper floors were more than welcomed. He felt his muscles subtly give into the atmosphere, as his brain had been Pavlov’d time and time again to correlate the final struggle up to the second floor with imminent sleep and cuddling.

Not this time, though.

The door swished open, the hallway lights outlining his path to Shar’s still-unkempt mass of blankets, mattresses, and pillows. Tracy was softly let down into their cloud-like embrace. Her hands suddenly gained awareness in a sudden reflex, latching onto the back of his neck and doing their best to pull him down with her.

His world tumbled down until his head pressed into the cloth and her head dug its way back into the curve of his neck. She mumbled, far beyond the plane of regular fatigue, the slow motions of her lips leaving faint traces of saliva on his collarbone.

“Mmmmmissed you… Dun go… pleeeeease.”

He smirked, softly shaking his head. The skip of his heart was hard to ignore, and the way it melted with her pleading words made it all the worse. All he could offer was a quick squeeze back before he had to pull her desperate paws off of himself… no matter how much it broke his heart to not be there for her.

An uneasy frown marred his face. He realized what she was doing to him after he subtly admitted it to Oliver earlier that day, and he now knew what he was doing to her by feeding back into it. There was hardly any balance between supporting her and that fluttering feeling anymore. It filled him with *that* guilt.

The will to stop deluding himself and to give in was stronger with every interaction… but it wouldn’t be right. He took any excuse to ignore where his actions led him. Still, he couldn’t turn back; not helping her would only thin the tightrope he walked evermore, only escalating her frantic reliance on him. Everything he did only strengthened their interdependence with each passing day.

Why did it have to feel like watching a car crash over the course of several weeks? No matter how much he tried to look away or lie by telling himself ‘I won’t crash, we’re not even in the same lane!’, he pressed on the accelerator a little harder. What the hell was he doing? Why did he do this to himself? To *her*? Shame crawled up his neck as he wrinkled his nose in disgust… The worst part was that he knew he would be falling into her even more tomorrow.

Something had to happen soon… something with a lengthy, painful, and long-overdue conversation, but with the blood-moon so close, he had to prioritize the settlement over her.

Harrison turned around to face his guardian and followed her out of the room with a drawn-out exhale. He grabbed a cup of leftover never-sleep juice on the way out and chugged the last of it while the cold outdoors greeted him with a chilling breeze. The weather sure as hell didn’t help his body’s tired protest of blue-balling himself with sleep.

Shar’s curious tail found its way over his shoulders. Its cool, squishy underside sapped what little heat he had left in his neck, but that was just fine with how it reignited a different warmth inside his ribs. He rubbed the portion that hung down over his chest, a little more conscious about how he kneaded the tough dorsal skin after he spoke to Oliver.

The way the short craftsman worded his curious responses to Harrison’s confusion earlier didn’t help him.

*‘I… would not know exactly. I believe that depends on how you perceive her.’*

How he ‘perceived’ Shar? He already knew how he perceived her. It was how he always did—save for the first few interactions they shared on the planet. Yet, now that he was really analyzing how he acted with Tracy… he couldn’t help but notice the parallels; the forwardness, the tactile exchanges, and the subconscious urges to return it all felt too human—even if sometimes it included inhuman appendages.

He scrubbed his eyes again, the motions drawing up a few pinpricks underneath the skin. Cera’s drink was working its way through him quickly.

The brief distraction put his thoughts back into perspective. What was he even thinking? It was all a conscious distraction from everything he was trying to ignore from that day. And, maybe even that was also a distraction to the distraction. God, he was a mess—an irrational mess.

Harrison finally found his way back to his desk. The familiar aura of his workspace eased a portion of his worries. He was working, doing *something* that would produce a feasible benefit to his burgeoning village.

The engineer knew he’d have to look into the exterminator he scavenged or the information chip still pressed into his data pad, but the slow, ever-grueling crushing of his ribs told him the blood-moon wasn’t far off. Walls, turrets, and long nights of training had yet to be implemented. He opened up a new window to begin when he felt a touch slide down his arms and curl around his chest.

Shar wrapped herself around him almost entirely, her tired grin poking into his peripherals as she nestled her head over his shoulder. The wall of a woman just barely gave his hands the motion to work as per usual.

He easily let her slip into the massive cracks in his judgment with her smooth caress and tender muzzle nuzzling.

Was everything truly a distraction?

- I thought Picoprep tasted quite nice. I started pooping approximately 2-3 hours after I took the first one. Then basically pooped the whole night and morning. It was unpleasant and you really cannot and should not trust a fart - it's all liquid after a certain point. I basically survived the day drinking clear Gatorade and broth and lying in bed not moving much to not exert too much energy. 

**The procedure**

- I had no reason to be nervous. I spoke to the anaesthetist and nurses who all assured me it was all going to be okay, that I was going to be completely asleep as I was to be sedated. The nurse said they check my vitals the whole time and even try to tap me on the face to make sure I'm properly sedated.

- As soon as the mouth guard went in, I basically fell immediately asleep. It didn't feel like time sped up. It honestly just felt like a really nice 30 minute nap. I was distracted by the mouth guard that I basically didn't even realise the sedative went in. 

- I woke up being moved to the recovery wing. It felt like I was waking up from a nice nap. I felt relaxed and zero pain in my throat or butt. 

- The best feeling is being given a sandwich and a coffee after basically eating nothing the day before.

**My advice**

- Do not be afraid. If you're sedated, it's easy, even relaxing. The prep will be the most unpleasant bit. Apart from that, there's no reason to feel anxious. It's a standard procedure that I could very easily do again. It only took around 30 minutes. I basically tried to keep calm by focusing on the then and now, and not the future, kind of like what a sweet dog would think, or what you'd learn during a mindfulness session. My thought process was basically: ""I'm currently lying on the bed"" to ""I'm being wheeled in"" to ""Hello doctor, oh, a mouth guard"" to waking up in the recovery wing.

Never thought much about anything other than salt. Been drinking some coffee but went over to tee. Coffee is tough to drink now. Some Pepsi Max, since I've never had an issue with those kind of drinks.

Day 3: Accidently ate half a baby spoon of baby food, trying to trick my toddler. So yeah technicaly I broke my fast then. But I felt that amount was so tiny that it didn't effect anything.

Anyways. 106.3 kg to 99.1 kg.

I feel like I need to give some backstory here so bear with me and thx for reading :)

  
Our current home is a standard track home from 1992, 2 sty colonial 4BR, 2200 Sq Ft. 0 character. Our first home was an arts and crafts colonial from the 1920s and stunning. Really a beauty in so many ways and the quality of the build well it was not like what we have now. A job relocation moved us here 16 yrs ago. I am a multi media artist, and a weaver. My father is/was a carpenter and a fine craftsman at that. Aesthetics and materials matter to me. I dig deep into research when I am shopping for anything, shoes, appliances, tools, clothing. I prefer quality, beauty and longevity of an item. We love where we live and hope to retire and always have this house. It is in desperate need of some love and improvements. I am not thinking ""resale"" when I am planning this kitchen. We have lived here 16 yrs, 3 kids (2 in college, one in middle school) 2 cats, 1 big dog, huge extended family. We LIVE in this house and my 3 boys and pets show the true love we have for this home! We are excited to take on several projects over the next few years. Kitchen first. We cook a lot and LOVE to cook, not really foodies per se, but my husband and I cook a lot. We are refinishing all the oak floors in the downstairs, it will be throughout the kitchen and hopefully a light white oak look if we can attain that. I am so drawn to honed marble for all of the counters, but I know the drama. Plus we are putting in a lovely coffee espresso bar and a med size island (4 adult seats) all in the same stone. Light wood bottom cabinets and white on top. Minimal, clean lines, but not harsh and sterile is what we are going for. Utilitarian, but still beautiful and cozy if that makes sense. I love wood, and beautiful textiles, wool, linen is everywhere in my house.

So everything leads me to quartz for the counters, but the internal battle I am having is REAL as it is man made and not 100% stone. I know my husband and I will never do this kitchen again. I would love a natural stone. Honed marble that has beautiful grey soft veining and some character is really what I want and is exactly the texture and feel I want, but I will kill it. I am hard on things, messy and do not have a housekeeper. White granite is just not the same. I also do not want high shine. I want a matte soft finish. Our builder is recommending Vadara quartz. I have seen the samples and will go look at slabs soon. Anyone familiar with Vadara? Please help me pic a few patterns that may help me achieve the look I am hoping for and I'd love any reccs or insight.

OR

Our current home is a standard track home from 1992, 2 sty colonial 4BR, 2200 Sq Ft. 0 character. Our first home was an arts and crafts colonial from the 1920s and stunning. Really a beauty in so many ways and the quality of the build well it was not like what we have now. A job relocation moved us here 16 yrs ago. I am a multi media artist, and a weaver. My father is/was a carpenter and a fine craftsman at that. Aesthetics and materials matter to me. I dig deep into research when I am shopping for anything, shoes, appliances, tools, clothing. I prefer quality, beauty and longevity of an item. We love where we live and hope to retire and always have this house. It is in desperate need of some love and improvements. I am not thinking ""resale"" when I am planning this kitchen. We have lived here 16 yrs, 3 kids (2 in college, one in middle school) 2 cats, 1 big dog, huge extended family. We LIVE in this house and my 3 boys and pets show the true love we have for this home! We are excited to take on several projects over the next few years. Kitchen first. We cook a lot and LOVE to cook, not really foodies per se, but my husband and I cook a lot. We are refinishing all the oak floors in the downstairs, it will be throughout the kitchen and hopefully a light white oak look if we can attain that. I am so drawn to honed marble for all of the counters, but I know the drama. Plus we are putting in a lovely coffee espresso bar and a med size island (4 adult seats) all in the same stone. Light wood bottom cabinets and white on top. Minimal, clean lines, but not harsh and sterile is what we are going for. Utilitarian, but still beautiful and cozy if that makes sense. I love wood, and beautiful textiles, wool, linen is everywhere in my house.

So everything leads me to quartz for the counters, but the internal battle I am having is REAL as it is man made and not 100% stone. I know my husband and I will never do this kitchen again. I would love a natural stone. Honed marble that has beautiful grey soft veining and some character is really what I want and is exactly the texture and feel I want, but I will kill it. I am hard on things, messy and do not have a housekeeper. White granite is just not the same. I also do not want high shine. I want a matte soft finish. Our builder is recommending Vadara quartz. I have seen the samples and will go look at slabs soon. Anyone familiar with Vadara? Please help me pic a few patterns that may help me achieve the look I am hoping for and I'd love any reccs or insight.

1jy7o9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuntaCana/comments/1jy7o9l/majestic_mirage_review_finale/,Majestic Mirage Review Finale,"I had posted an “in stay” review of the Majestic Mirage a few days ago https://www.reddit.com/r/PuntaCana/s/XMk7l0b2ds and thought I would just add a few things from the last days of my trip. 


Service: This actually got better as the weekend approached, I don’t know why. More bartenders at the beach bar in the Mirage Club section and also more beach servers. Definitely was getting asked way more frequently about drinks throughout the day. It was more on par with how my wife and I remember it being at the Mirage. 

Beach: There was a definite trend over the course of the entire trip, mornings were usually pretty busy all over the beach not just the Mirage. After lunch though the beach substantially died down and was noticeably more quiet. Again, if you were strolling down to the beach around 10 am, you might be able to find some chairs, but good luck. For those of you who bitch about the chair situation at these resorts I would say by 10 am there were butts in every chair that had been reserved by people earlier in the morning. The clientele of this resort at least in the Mirage Club section tends to be older, and I think they’re just more likely to get down to the beach earlier. 

Crowd: This wasn’t covered in the first part of the review. Mirage Club guests tend to be older. Think 30+. I’m perfectly fine with that. There was one large group of spring breakers there, all high school seniors. Probably 20 of them total between boys and girls and they all seemed to know each other. With this being the beginning of April, I think the bulk of spring breaks are over so this was probably the last group to have theirs. The spring breakers could definitely get annoying and I could tell at various moments bartenders in the lobby bar would get annoyed as these kids wondered if they should get vodka, rum, or tequila with their Coke. 

Housekeeping: I don’t think our room was ever cleaned during the trip to the level as to when we initially got into the room on day 1. Never looked like they swept well and the restocking of things like towels and TP still persisted. The housekeeping effort was really lackluster compared to other resorts we’ve stayed at. We were there for 10 days, The room gets dirty with sand and other stuff. 

Checkout: Arturo our butler who was meeting with us everyday scheduled a bellman to come grab our luggage and met us in the lobby for checkout. Checkout took all of 5 minutes, the easiest checkout I’ve experienced from any resort I’ve been to. We didn’t have any room charges, so it was fast. Just got the checkout card and that was it. 

Transportation: As mentioned previously I used Mike Fisher Punta Cana, and got a private van. Confirmed the pickup time via the ongoing email chain the day before our departure. Driver showed up on time and got us to the airport in about 30 minutes. $70 was the fee for round trip, and we tipped $10 each way. $90 for private round trip transportation. I strongly suggest private, it’s just nice not having to make extra stops. 

Miscellaneous: With this being our 4th total time to a Majestic property (1 time Colonial and 3 Mirage) I had  asked our butler if there were any returning guest benefits should we stay there again. He mentioned if you stay there enough you can get free spa packages, private dining on the beach, and that one couple he was looking after who has now stayed at the Mirage a whopping 25 times (3 times a year) is staying there for free. He said he made sure to put a note in the computer so next time we stay there we should get some sort of returning guest “comp.” 

Since I put this in the first part of my review I’ll update everyone on the state of my “condition.” ***This could be TMI. 

I had said I had gotten food poisoning of some sort earlier in the trip. By the end of the trip I was feeling fine physically, but was still have terrible diarrhea 10+ times a day. Managed to track down a store by the casino that had Pepto and tried that, it maybe helped a little. Spent like $70 on enough Pepto for a couple days, but I was desperate as our travel day home was looming and this illness could cause issues. Think about having to use the bathroom urgently and suddenly, but not being able to, particularly during the ascent and descent of a flight when you can’t get up out of your seat. Imodium was still being ineffective. 

Actually reached out in a FB Majestic Mirage group to see if anyone had any medicine they could help. Ended up connecting with a woman whose husband was going through the same thing, sounded like it was even worse than mine. She had talked to the staff at the coffee shop who suggest an antibiotic at the drug store on site. Figured it was worth a shot for $15 for a pack of antibiotics. Long story short, by the grace of God I managed to make it home without any accidents and will most likely see my doctor early this week as I’m still dealing with diarrhea.


Overall, I would still recommend this resort. Sure some things weren’t great, but I can’t stress enough that for the money, I think this resort provides a great value especially if you get it on sale. If you’re going to book make sure you are checking booking through the Majestic website directly, that site has been priced the best for me the last couple times.

It's a completely new place and experience for me. I am wearing my current favourite dark red top and exactly the same colored lipstick with  white pants. I have  got circular earrings and my hair is open.  The butterfly hair cut i got was definitely worth it. 

My bluish grey bag perfectly sits on the table and my dark green wind cheater placed over it. The setting sun rays are gently hitting my face. Everything looks so organised and perfect, I feel relieved. 

I have been feeling gorgeous than ever these days. I grew up hating the way I looked. It is not that, I have learnt to accept and embrace myself, but I have changed and I have worked hard  on myself and it was totally worth it. 

Well I am the 2nd prettiest girl I know. Maybe I need a reality check, but honestly, I am doing great in my delusion. Sometimes I catch myself  seeking attention and validation and nothing is wrong with it. I am not wanting validation from men, but from a man. 

The restaurant is getting darker now. I can see the sun  is slowly  fading away. Outside the window, people are walking and there is a noise. Everyone seems busy in their own world. Just now a thela wala dai passed down the road. The sweat rolling down his Dhaka topi whispers a promise in silence, he is going to have a sound sleep tonight. 

A guy  just came and sat in front of me. Not at my table But at the next one, facing me. The space between us is dim, but we both are glowing under the soft orange rays. 

He has a helmet in his hand, uff. He has a camera too, uff uff. He is tall, maybe around 5'9 uff uff uff. 

He is wearing a dark blue windcheater, milk coffee colored pants, and dark blue shoes. His outfit completely compliments his dark skin, french beard and the simple haircut, uff uff uff uff. Oh gosh, he has got some good thighs too. He is the definition of perfection. 

I once told a guy, I met online, that thighs do make a guy look attractive. But he laughed at me saying thighs were a female characteristic, and he started explaining to me logically and biologically how thighs have an important role in child birth. But believe me, thighs are a key trait in making a guy look hot.

He is so busy with his camera. He doesn't ever care to look at this pretty lady in front of him.

Sometime, he smiles, ughhh that dimple on his right cheek. Sometime, he gets serious,  oh the movement of his eyebrows. And now he gets normal again,  puts thumb on his right cheek, and covers his mouth with the rest of his fingers, gazes out  the window with those dark brown eye balls, beneath long long eye lashes and starts wondering something. 

 Suddenly, His eyes  turned towards me. I nervously glanced down at the menu. My heart is beating faster, and I am turning pages with every beat. 

I tried to look up, he looks at the table.  I look at the table and he looks at me.

I could see from the corner of my eye, he is still looking at me, he is just lost. And here i got the validation I wanted. 

Oh I wish, i could see the photos he has clicked, 

Oh I wish I could hear his side of story,

Oh I wish, i could know what he is wandering about,

But sometimes sharing things with others, makes you void. I don't want him to live in nothingness. 

Should I start a conversation with him? He might think i am a creep. I have been desperate for love and attention for all these years, but not today!  I should stop myself from moving towards him. 

Don't try to attract me, through your dimple as the collection of dead star, 

Don't try to alcoholize me, with your aura radiating from your presence to far-far. 

Well I let it leave, in that way.  if he is the one god will bring us together some other day.

Oh spaces between us

Keep getting deeper

It's harder to reach you

1jy7dcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/zizek/comments/1jy7dcd/toward_a_gay_accelerationism/,Toward a gay accelerationism,"Zizek's stance on transgenderism, so far as I understand it, has shifted from a more critical tone based on arguments similar to Zupancic's concerning  gender as a multiplicity of reified identities which he views as avoiding castration anxiety or sexual difference—to a more celebratory tone which makes transgender individuals out to be stunning and brave heroes who radically accept the deadlock, the fact of there being no such thing as a sexual relation, and the failure inherent in all attempts to forge a coherent sexual identity.

What I am going to say is not only different from what zizek says, it does not even share the bulk of his assumptions. I want to clarify exactly what I mean when I say that I am ""anti-queer"" and hand in hand with this, that I am even a bit anti-trans. From zizek's perspective, no doubt, I can only be described as a non-dupe who has erred.

What is queerness? Halperin (in Saint Foucault) says it is an identity without an essence, and having no recourse to any essence, he then goes on to equate it with a ""feeling"" of being marginalized. That such a definition would include many conservative Christians is pretty interesting to me. Edelman correctly inverts this a bit by providing a structural ""essence"" (the positionality of the death drive) that is disruptive of identity. The OG queer theorist (although he did not call himself queer) was Guy Hocquenghem, who saw ""homosexual desire"" as aimed at the abolition of ""phallocracy"" and sexual identity. Bersani is interested in the anti-communal, narcissistic, and frankly destructive dimension of homosexual desire. For Butler, it is largely a matter of ""troubling"" gender norms. I want to point out because it is illustrative of larger issues that there is a curious hypocrisy at the start of Undoing Gender (which otherwise has some interesting stuff about being beside oneself) in which she says:

""And in that language and in that context, we have to present ourselves as bounded beings, distinct, recognizable, delineated, subjects before the law, a community defined by sameness. Indeed, we had better be able to use that language to secure legal protections and entitlements. But perhaps we make a mistake if we take the definitions of who we are, legally, to be adequate descriptions of what we are about."" (it is worth pointing out that she starts this chapter by asking what makes a world livable—this raises important questions about which world, if any, we would like to ""belong"" to).

This is all very cursory and maybe even offensive if you're somebody who's interested in what these authors have to say. Let's add to the mix, prior to anything like ""queer theory"" (unless we turn to figures like Ulrichs) the great transgressive writers, Jean Genet, André Gide, Isidore Ducasse, who drive home the point that queer transgression is not an ""accident"". That is to say, transgression as such, and not even just troubling certain gender norms, is intimately related to what it means to be queer. Along with the theorists' interests in mirror stage narcissism, the death drive, and so on, this should give us a basic frame of reference to begin addressing the issue of queerness.

When I say transgression is not an accident, I mean it is not as if somebody is first gay and then finds that, whoops! they have violated some norm and are now regarded as transgressive, or even that they will transgress norms *actively* in the interest of fighting for their rights. In fact, despite what Butler says, it is not clear to me that gay *rights* have much to do with anything at all, or that this ought to be our focus. The situation seems to be much more that queerness itself is based on a primitive choice to radically *reject* the phallus and what one is supposed-to-be. Any finger-wagging about non-dupes, etc. can only miss the point that such a choice (which is no doubt conditioned by but irreducible to objective conditions like a supposed breakdown of the nuclear family, an end of the age of the symbolic father) has always already occurred.

So to be queer is to have made a radical choice (which can be continually affirmed) to reject the phallus and the identity we were supposed to have, to enjoy a certain relationship to transgression and the death drive, to trouble sexual norms, and to have as one's desire nothing less than the complete abolition of the phallus/family, the overthrow of existing social relations. What absolutely is *not* present in such a statement is any nonsense about rights, interests, well-being, or what makes a world liveable. We are devoted not to making this world liveable for us, but at its complete overthrow. We are not homo economicus; we are homos of a very different sort. Furthermore, we must characterize Hocquenghem's rejection of the class struggle thesis as a moralistic *betrayal* of his desire based on the principle that it is heteronormative. As queers, we have no principles; not even the principle of avoiding ""heteronormativity"", which risks substantializing queer desire as a kind of ""whatever the straights don't do"", an inverted world in which sweet is sour, etc. Everything was started on the wrong foot so far as that goes, and now the whole edifice of queerness as we know it is uncomfortably saturated with bourgeois assumptions, values, and preoccupations.

I hope it's clear already why the principle of generalizing use of ""preferred pronouns"" is at odds with the preceeding, at least so long as it is inconvenient—i would like to introduce the idea of homoanalysis. Homoanalysis is the redeployment of queer desire in the workplace, the deterritorialization of queerness and it's application to the class struggle. On the one hand, it reorients the proletariat in relation to queerness and hence in relation to women, heterosexist ideology, and identity; on the other, it tends inexorably in the direction of unionization and communism.

To put it plainly: if queers get industrial jobs, there is no use trying to ignore the fact of queerness or the presence of some homophobia, or to force relations indifferently to these. Instead, the transference relations involving queerness, homophobia, latent homosexual desire, etc. have got to be *made use of* since they are the material we have at our disposal in challenging ideology and building class consciousness.

There are times when it is helpful to upset certain assumptions—not to mention that it's fun. Saying the word ""faggot"", for example: people don't expect that. Speaking out against woke politics and SJWs, attributing these to the capitalist class and driving home the fact that *these are their bosses* they same people who chide and punish them in the workplace. These have the effect of disrupting identity expectations and making one's own desire somewhat enigmatic, among other things. Furthermore, it is not clear to me that there is any reason *not* to say ""faggot"" or to encourage others to say it when it's rather fun for all of us and facilitates an antagonistic relation to the rules of the bosses, and it seems like the assumption that it is problematic is based more on something like hetero-bourgeois ""common sense"" than on any actual consequences. 

In point of fact, I have had different kinds of success with homoanalysis. I have had originally homophobic, straight coworkers come around and swap identities with me: calling themselves gay and calling me straight repeatedly for the duration of my stay at that factory. This was a complete 180. I even gave one guy the nickname ""Hot Chris"" and everyone started calling him that. Essentially, everyone became kind of gay, one nail in the coffin of what Christian Maurel called ""homosexual ghettoization"", and the antagonism, a false one, between queerness and straight working people was dismantled, which facilitates the movement which abolishes the present state of things, and ultimately the abolition of the father family and society as we know it.

I have handed out certificates stating ""this person is certified non-homophobic"" to be flashed at SJWs. The factory in which this happened also unionized, and coworkers from it still ask me questions about marxism and social issues. My best friend from that factory was on the bargaining committee and has been asking me about the rise in outright fascist rhetoric and how to combat it, I am very proud of him.

As gays, we have a LOT of stories. Stories about sex with married dads. Sometimes they tell us excitedly that they have sons the same age as us. Some of them have secret houses their families don't know about where they live with male lovers. Straight people benefit from hearing stories like these, in the proper context when a relationship has been forged, because it reveals aspects of a society that might otherwise go unnoticed by them. They also enjoy these stories in my experience. I remember when a woman from the other shift came to help out on mine and said to me, ""I keep trying to talk to the guys here but they're all more interested in your sex life than in my own"". This I think makes it clear that there is a real possibility of making entire factories a bit gay as well as guiding them in the direction of unions and communism, which need not be conceived as two unrelated processes.

One way of framing what is happening here is as ""troubling gender"", but doing so *with the end* of the abolition of the family in mind. Where troubling gender would not be conducive to this end, it is not done as a matter of ""principle"". This is why, for example, telling people to use your ""preferred pronouns"" may or may not be useful at any particular juncture.

Currently, the queer community has been configured as ""the woke mob"". I see this not as an issue with queerness as such—i have just explained what the nature of queerness is—but as a particular territorialization of fixed configuration of queerness which places it on the side of the bourgeoisie and in antagonism to workers. Zizek says:

""Thinkers like Frederic Lordon have recently demonstrated the inconsistency of “cosmopolitan” anti-nationalist intellectuals who advocate “liberation from a belonging” and in extremis tend to dismiss every search for roots and every attachment to a particular ethnic or cultural identity as an almost proto-Fascist stance.""

Because I'm advocating something like rootlessness, involving deterritorialization and negativity, I would like to distinguish homoanalysis from anything amenable to fascism. I do think the woke mob has adopted a criticism of Israel that cannot be clearly distinguished from all the old antisemitic tropes as well as an antagonistic relationship to the working class. In response, I think it is important both to emphasize the historical uniqueness of the Holocaust and the particular logics of antisemitism, as opposed to falling back on vague abstract categories of ""racism"" and ""genocide"" while eliding all these differences—antisemitism will always be the last defense of the capitalists and is less an ""if"" than a ""when"" which is why it's despicable so many leftists have lost sight of this. Moreo er, it goes without saying there can be no compromise on siding with the working class in the class antagonism: that is the sole means we have to arrive at our end goal.

So, where do we stand with respect to incest? After all, what we are aiming at is really just the abolition of its prohobition. Well obviously, for the moment, there's no reason not to do it if you want to. But it has to be said that with the abolition of the family, it will become not a possibility but rather an impossibility insofar as the conditions of having a parent to have sex with will no longer exist. The unholy union of workers and queers will produce innumerable generations of Übermenschen who have no mothers or fathers to fuck. So if you're going to fuck your relatives, then I suggest you do it now while there is still a law.

I originally wrote this very quickly during a coffee break, then I found I was banned from reddit for three days. I appealed that ban successfully, but I've added some random stuff. I guess I'm just saying forgive me if the flow is weird. It's not my most aesthetic piece, but I think it explains my point of view well enough. 

Edit: I'll just add that I encourage anyone who's interested NOT ONLY to get an industrial job, but also to undertake a psychoanalysis with a Lacanian analyst. I've been doing it for a bit over a year now, and it's very helpful for thinking through ends, desire, impasses, mechanisms, etc.",0,1744550089.0,zizek,6,0.4,False

All the residents were so happy and enjoyed it so much!

I want to drop off a small gift with a thank you card. I have already gotten the K9 a Kong toy and some sweet peppers- his favorite.

However I made plans to meet for coffee with her yesterday and she agreed. The vibe was definitely there, and my initial nervousness leading up to the date evaporated as soon as I saw her. Our conversation was pretty much effortless and we were able to talk about a lot of different things. She did most of the talking but asked me questions as well.

I had plans to take her to go shoot pool at this other spot after but she had to go back and babysit. So the date ended after about an hour and a half.

I walked her to the subway, and we hugged before I said to text me when she was back home. You know to make sure she got home safe. 

Well she never did. It’s the next day and my initial gut feeling of “Wow that went great” is now “Did it go great?” because of her lack of text. Again it’s not a huge deal but something that kind of threw me.

I think everything was fine up until very recently when my partner made strange comments. It began with her saying that she finds it “weird” that I spend so much time with my siblings (for context, me and my siblings do not have a relationship with my parents, and have been through so much that only we can understand each other and we enjoy spending quality time together when we can). When she said that I kind of brushed it off saying it’s just I have a different family dynamic and she might find it weird but it’s my normal. She is not as close with her family.

The next comment was when we move in together whether I am going to be spending 3 nights away from her. I kinda thought well I am not sure because I’ll be living in the house I am buying and not sure how it’ll all pan out. Further comments were made about my social media platform I have a huge following and a whole manager who does rely on me to make money so I have to be on my phone a lot and make content. When I’m with her I avoid using my phone much to pay attention and spend quality time together but she recently made a comment that she thinks I’m always on my phone which I know I’m not.

The one thing she said which I shut down straightaway was we were having conversations about going on holiday and I stated that I wanna go solo travelling as I have done it before and it’s something I enjoy and want to do whether I’m single or in a relationship she proceeded to say that she finds it “weird” I said I don’t agree with the comment and it’s something I want to do so I’m gonna do it regardless. The other day we went to a coffee place I have worked with and have a professional relationship I messaged the guy who works there that I’m gonna pop in and perhaps try the new drinks. She had a whole bf about how I’m pretty and he probably likes it and that she’ll pay for it. I didn’t enjoy the whole trip because she made it miserable. It feels like I’m being accused of things I don’t even know about. I’m not sure there is much to salvage though we have had amazing memories but I think it’s something that’ll probably be the cause of a bigger issue in the future.

Plus she texts me all the time but I can’t respond on time because I’m either busy working, spending time with my friends or family. Even when I have clarified that I’m spending a day with friends/family she texts me and calls me which I find so annoying like have some consideration, she gets upset when I don’t respond on time and it feels like she accuses me of things.

I think I’m brushing it off because it is another woman but I genuinely haven’t taken a single comment like this from a man I’d be out straightaway but the dynamic with a woman is so different and I think I’m ignoring the red flags.",5,1744549822.0,bisexual,1,1.0,False

We’ve all had those days—when the alarm feels louder, the coffee tastes weaker, and your mood slumps before the day even gets started. While occasional bad moods are part of life, staying stuck in them doesn’t have to be. The good news is that with some simple actions, you can lift your mood and set a positive tone for the rest of the day.

# Simple Mood Boosters to Brighten Your Day

When you’re feeling low, making even the smallest shift in your actions can have a huge positive impact on your mood. The key is to lean into activities that naturally spark happiness. Here are a few of the most effective mood boosters to try when you need to move from bad to better.

# Get Moving

https://preview.redd.it/m1i99j0solue1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=65d37ce40640d3ebe6c227e45e7763ce15d0c9cf

Physical movement is one of the quickest ways to boost your mood. Why? [**Exercise**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/exercise-energy-and-mood-understanding-the-connection/) releases endorphins, chemicals in your brain often referred to as “feel-good hormones.” You don’t need to commit to an intense workout either—something as small as a 10-minute walk around the block can work wonders.

**Try some of these movement tips to brighten your day:**

* Take a brisk walk or stretch for five minutes at your desk.
* Dance around your living room to your favorite upbeat song.
* Do simple yoga poses like Child’s Pose, Downward Dog, or Cat-Cow to relax and stretch.

# Breathe and Meditate

Take a moment to focus on your breathing, which can help calm anxieties and improve your mental clarity. Deep breathing not only reduces stress but also improves your body’s oxygen levels, giving you both physical and emotional relief.

* Try box breathing: inhale for four seconds, hold for four seconds, exhale for four seconds, and hold for four seconds before repeating.
* Use a guided meditation app like Calm or Headspace, which offers short meditations specifically designed to tackle a bad day.

Even just five minutes of intentional breathing or [**meditation**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/a-beautiful-mind-and-life-with-meditation/) can reset your emotional state.

# Visualize

Visualization is a powerful tool that’s often used by high-performing athletes, but it works for everyone. By picturing something positive, your brain releases dopamine, giving you a boost of happiness.

**Here’s how to use visualization:**

* Close your eyes and imagine a moment that makes you truly happy—like lying on a breezy beach or laughing with friends.
* Visualize a future achievement or scenario that excites you, like hitting a personal milestone or going on an exciting vacation.

This simple mental exercise can redirect your focus and improve your overall outlook.

# Listen to Music

https://preview.redd.it/9mddttfuolue1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=304db9a412e0209a0a0de4a4755b457e333743f8

Music holds the remarkable power to change your mood in an instant. A lively song with an upbeat tempo can have you smiling before the first chorus hits, while a soothing melody can calm your nerves after a stressful day.

**Tips to uplift yourself with** [**music:**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/tap-into-the-powerful-effects-of-music/)

* Create a playlist of your favorite happy tunes for moments when you need a lift.
* Experiment with genres—sometimes upbeat jazz, classical, or even nature sounds can be soothing.

Plug in your headphones, hit play, and feel your spirits rise.

# Connect with Someone You Love

When our minds are heavy, talking to someone who makes us feel loved can lighten the load. Opening up to a close friend, family member, or partner can help you process emotions and feel supported.

* Call or video chat a loved one to catch up, even if it’s just for 10 minutes.
* Send a quick text message to a friend you’ve been meaning to reconnect with.

Not every conversation needs to be deep—sometimes a little casual chatting can do wonders for your mood.

# Give

https://preview.redd.it/9bbuk48yolue1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d29ce283f9d2e992c00140c262e444b905978df

Science shows that acts of kindness can boost your overall happiness. It can be as simple as paying a compliment to a co-worker, holding the door open for someone, or writing a heartfelt note to a friend or loved one.

**Ideas to spread kindness and improve your mood:**

* [**Volunteer**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/how-volunteering-can-boost-your-mood-and-well-being/) at a local shelter or community center.
* Buy a coffee for the person behind you in line at the café.
* Donate clothes or items you no longer need to charity.

The joy of giving creates an emotional ripple effect, benefiting both you and others.

# Laugh

It’s no secret that [**laughter**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/the-added-value-of-laughter/) is one of the best medicines. It releases endorphins almost immediately and can relieve physical tension, leaving you feeling both happier and more relaxed.

Need a quick laugh? Try this:

* Watch a funny video or sitcom. (Animal bloopers and stand-up comedy never fail!)
* Recall a funny memory or joke that always brings a smile to your face.
* Spend time around friends or family members who make you laugh.

Even cracking a smile forces your mood in an upward direction, so don’t be afraid to giggle unapologetically.

# Step into Nature

https://preview.redd.it/3fd6pnc0plue1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad2c829cb3436da687ec8a836b4a2baacd417379

Nature offers an incredible calming effect. Spending time outdoors can improve concentration, lift your mood, and reduce feelings of anxiety.

Try these tips for reconnecting with the natural world:

* Take a short walk in a nearby park.
* Bring your coffee or tea outside and enjoy it in your backyard or a sunny spot near a window.
* Plant flowers, herbs, or vegetables and bask in the joy of caring for something alive.

[**Fresh air and sunshine**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/the-value-of-spending-time-in-nature/) have a way of clearing the mind and softening any stress.

# Do Something Creative

Creative expression is a fantastic outlet for processing emotions and getting out of a slump. It doesn’t matter whether you’re Picasso or just someone with a pencil and sketchpad—what matters is the joy of creating.

Some [**creative ways**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/the-why-and-how-of-sharpening-your-creativity-for-success/) to lift your mood:

* Write in a journal about your day or how you’re feeling.
* Cook or bake something new—experimenting in the kitchen can be therapeutic.
* Pick up a paintbrush, knitting needles, or even try some DIY crafts.

Creative activities engage your mind, offering new focus and energy.

# Why Does It Matter?

https://preview.redd.it/12dnq523plue1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=b58f90e487ac895dcc777a9b73d99d4f1a3e7243

Focusing on boosting your mood isn’t just about feeling good in the moment—it also sets the tone for more productive days, better relationships, and improved health. Research shows that positivity can enhance your immune system, reduce stress, and even extend your lifespan.

So a little backstory. I’m F19 and i’m having a bit of trouble with one of my bestfriends M20 (lets call him mike) for almost 10 years.

Now Mike has been seeing this guy (Jake) for about 5 months. A few months in, Mike told me that Jake had said some unkind things about me. I was in a mental facility for 2 weeks unexpectedly, and my birthday was in a month and Mike and one of my other friends had booked a trip away for my birthday like 3 months before i even knew i was going in. Anyways, Jake had made some comments like “whys she going away if shes in a mental facility” mind you, it was a 2 week program. And he also said that i went to the facility to “promote” my birthday trip because no one was going? (Even tho mike and my other friends were going and thats all i needed)

Its always been a bit back and forth from then with him. He’s said some pretty cruel things to me and i dont mean to be rude, but he is one of those mean awful stuck up, my shit dont stink gays. 

I always used to say to Mike that if my boyfriend ever spoke to my friends like that, it would be done. Mind you, i have had alot of friends that had boyfriends, and never ever had a problem getting along with any of them. Except one that bullied me and dated my friend at the time- keep that in mind

Mike is the complete opposite gay. Bit of a shit talker, but wont say it to your face.

Mike would talk to me about Jake too and i just dont get a good relationship vibe from this man either. 

Anyways, my last straw was a couple of days ago. 

I had gone on tiktok live as a jokelol i was bored. Mind u on my fake account. Had my camera on and everything, and i was with a friend (Amelia). We were just talking to another fella we met on there and Mike joins on his account. Turns out he was also with Jake. Now I could tell jake was making those sly comments going at me, and then started to fat shame me. Mike had then left the live and messaged me saying Jake was rude. 

Next minute, someone comes on requesting to be a guest. Turns out it was Jake on his fake account. He then starts to continue shaming me again. Now Amelia, goes off her nut. While Mike, my bestfriend, is sitting there in silence letting him talk about me like that. 

I ended up getting banned cause some inappropriate stuff was said. 

I was so mad and upset. I could not believe my bestfriend could sit there and let him talk about me like that. Mind you, on a live stream.

Mike messaged me, saying we need to organise coffee to diffuse this situation. But i am seriously not interested. Just took me back to highschool when my past friends boyfriend would shame me and she wouldnt do anything about it.

He then sent a long message, saying its his fault because hes basically the stirrer. Saying stuff to me about Jake and stuff hes said about me, and then who knows what Mike was telling Jake. (I always knew Mike was a shit talker, but didnt think i would be on that side of it.) he also said if nothing gets done he will be “forced to choose the 1 that pushes him to be better”

My response was - Right so ur choosing the one that fat shames me in front of ur face.

He doesn’t really seem to be phased that it is a disgusting personality. Especially since the same boyfriend of my friend that bullied me, bullied him for being gay.

I am just so annoyed and upset. I dont want to beg for our friendship because why should i be bloody doing that. I understand if maybe i talk bad about him to Mike, but he does that to himself. Mike has rarely talked good about Jake. 

My boyfriend thinks i should just kinda leave him and he will come back when things go to shit with this guy, but I dont want to be here for him when he falls. Like i know irs selfish but im sorry, the signs are right in fromt of him that Jake is an awful person. He has even had a Jake Hate party thrown for him, and not for good reasons. 

ALSO- some context of this man too. I thought this was messed up. The guy that we were talking to on live before Mike and Jake joined. He went live with them last night, and told me that Jake leaked Mikes, full legal name, DOB and HIS ADDRESS???!!!!! I was so 🤯🤯🤯.

If anyone else is going to be around Anjuna/Vagator/Arambol during that time, I’d be totally up to grab a beer, explore, or just vibe out by the beach. I’m into music, late-night conversations, random adventures, and good coffee—so if that’s your thing too, let’s connect!

Also, if you’ve been to Goa solo:
    1. Any tips or underrated places I should check        out?
    2. Any tricks for meeting fellow travelers?
    3. Cool spots for live music, flea markets, or sunset views?

Would especially love hostel suggestions that are solo-traveler friendly, open to all kinds of travelers, and not just party-all-night kinda places (though a little of that never hurts!).

Appreciate all the advice—and if you’re around during those dates, feel free to drop a comment or DM. Goa’s better when shared, right ?",1,1744549262.0,goatravel,0,1.0,False

I’ve gone through nearly 500g of coffee trying to balance dose, grind size, extraction time, and pressure — and I keep running into the same pattern:

⸻

The recurring issue:
	•	If the extraction time is good (25-30s) → the pressure is too high (almost touching the red zone, sometimes starting with drip flow).
	•	If the pressure is perfect (middle of the optimal zone) → the extraction time is too short (often 16-20s).
	•	And if I increase the volume to compensate → the shot ends up too diluted or lacking flavor.

⸻

My setup:
	•	Machine: De’Longhi La Specialista Opera
	•	Grinder: Built-in grinder (stepped adjustments)
	•	Grind range: 1-16 (most tests between 5/10 and 7/10)
	•	Water temp: 92°C -94
	•	Coffee: Medium roast, 100% arabica.

⸻

Test examples:
	1.	Single shot attempts
• 9.5g in → 19-20g out → 17-20 sec → pressure: high (almost max).
• Increased to 10g in → same grind → still too fast (23-24 sec) with pressure still very high.
	2.	Factory default volume tests
• 9.5g in → 30.5g out → 23 sec → pressure optimal.
Taste: too bitter.
	3.	Double shot attempts
• 17.97g in → 64g out → 21 sec → pressure: perfect, flow fast.
Taste: weak and over-diluted (likely under-extracted).
	4.	Further shot adjustment
• 11.62g in → 26g out → 12 sec → pressure perfect.
Taste: flat, watery, lacking flavor.
	5.	Higher dose attempt
• 12g in → 28g out → 30 sec → pressure very high (almost red).
Taste: weak, dull, lacks flavor depth.

⸻

Summary:
No matter what I try, I seem stuck in this cycle:
	•	Good pressure → too short extraction time.
	•	Good extraction time → too high pressure.

I’ve tried adjusting the dose, grind size (between 5 and 7), temperature (92-94°C), tamping pressure (the Opera’s press lever to the max) — and I can’t seem to find a balance.

⸻

My question:
Has anyone with this machine (or similar De’Longhi pressurized machines) managed to dial in an espresso where both pressure and extraction time fall into the ideal range?
Or is this a hardware limitation, and the solution is just to focus on flavor even if the pressure gauge isn’t “perfect”?

Any advice or shared experiences would be super appreciated! Thanks in advance.

So a little backstory. I’m F19 and i’m having a bit of trouble with one of my bestfriends M20 (lets call him mike) for almost 10 years.

Now Mike has been seeing this guy (Jake) for about 5 months. A few months in, Mike told me that Jake had said some unkind things about me. I was in a mental facility for 2 weeks unexpectedly, and my birthday was in a month and Mike and one of my other friends had booked a trip away for my birthday like 3 months before i even knew i was going in. Anyways, Jake had made some comments like “whys she going away if shes in a mental facility” mind you, it was a 2 week program. And he also said that i went to the facility to “promote” my birthday trip because no one was going? (Even tho mike and my other friends were going and thats all i needed)

Its always been a bit back and forth from then with him. He’s said some pretty cruel things to me and i dont mean to be rude, but he is one of those mean awful stuck up, my shit dont stink gays. 

I always used to say to Mike that if my boyfriend ever spoke to my friends like that, it would be done. Mind you, i have had alot of friends that had boyfriends, and never ever had a problem getting along with any of them. Except one that bullied me and dated my friend at the time- keep that in mind

Mike is the complete opposite gay. Bit of a shit talker, but wont say it to your face.

Mike would talk to me about Jake too and i just dont get a good relationship vibe from this man either. 

Anyways, my last straw was a couple of days ago. 

I had gone on tiktok live as a jokelol i was bored. Mind u on my fake account. Had my camera on and everything, and i was with a friend (Amelia). We were just talking to another fella we met on there and Mike joins on his account. Turns out he was also with Jake. Now I could tell jake was making those sly comments going at me, and then started to fat shame me. Mike had then left the live and messaged me saying Jake was rude. 

Next minute, someone comes on requesting to be a guest. Turns out it was Jake on his fake account. He then starts to continue shaming me again. Now Amelia, goes off her nut. While Mike, my bestfriend, is sitting there in silence letting him talk about me like that. 

I ended up getting banned cause some inappropriate stuff was said. 

I was so mad and upset. I could not believe my bestfriend could sit there and let him talk about me like that. Mind you, on a live stream.

Mike messaged me, saying we need to organise coffee to diffuse this situation. But i am seriously not interested. Just took me back to highschool when my past friends boyfriend would shame me and she wouldnt do anything about it.

He then sent a long message, saying its his fault because hes basically the stirrer. Saying stuff to me about Jake and stuff hes said about me, and then who knows what Mike was telling Jake. (I always knew Mike was a shit talker, but didnt think i would be on that side of it.) he also said if nothing gets done he will be “forced to choose the 1 that pushes him to be better”

1jy704m,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1jy704m/university_life_chapter_12/,University Life - Chapter 12,"David's hands trembled as he returned from the bathroom, his fingers raw and wrinkled from hours spent hand-washing Charlotte's delicate lingerie. His lower back screamed from hunching over the sink, every muscle stiff with exhaustion.

Emma lounged on the couch, her lips curling into a triumphant grin when she spotted him.

*""Ah! There you are,""* she cooed, stretching like a satisfied cat. *""We needed you earlier, you know. We were debating your favorite color.""* She exchanged a glance with Charlotte, who smirked into her wine glass. *""But don't worry—we figured it out. Pink.""*

David's brow furrowed. *Pink?* His favorite color had always been blue—a deep, quiet navy, like the sky just before dawn. But the lace thong still stuffed in his mouth muffled any protest.

*""We ordered you a little surprise,""* Emma continued, tapping her phone screen. *""Something special to celebrate your new... schedule.""* Her eyes glittered with mischief. *""But you'll have to wait to see it!""*

Charlotte snorted, swirling her drink. *""Oh, he'll love it.""*

David's stomach dropped.

Emma waved him over. *""Come sit with us! Well—not sit, obviously.""* She wiggled her stockinged feet, her smile sharpening. *""Since you can't talk, you might as well make yourself useful.""*

The unspoken command hung in the air.

David knelt.

The carpet dug into his knees as he carefully peeled off Emma's socks, his aching fingers working the fabric down her calves. She sighed dramatically, tilting her head back as he began massaging her arches.

*""Mmm, yes,""* she moaned, her toes flexing under his touch. *""Right there.""*

Charlotte watched, her gaze predatory. *""God, you earned this,""* she told Emma, draining her glass. *""And when she's done, I'm next.""* She pointed a warning finger at David. *""Same enthusiasm. Same pressure. If I feel one lazy finger...""* She let the threat linger.

Emma giggled, arching into David's hands. *""Oh, he wouldn't dare.""*

David's shoulders sagged, but his hands never stopped moving. The clock on the wall ticked past midnight.

It was going to be a *very* long night.

David’s thumbs dug into the arch of Emma’s foot, kneading in slow circles the way she liked. His shoulders ached from hunching, but her sigh of contentment pinned him in place.

*""God, you’re* good *at this,""* Emma purred, wiggling her toes against his palm. She didn’t look at him—just tilted her head toward Charlotte, who lounged on the couch with a glass of wine. *""He’s been* obsessed *with me since we were kids. Practiced just to impress me, right, David?""*

A bead of sweat slid down his temple. He nodded, mute.

Charlotte’s laugh was a razor dragged over glass. *""Let’s see if he’s* actually *good, or just desperate.""* She kicked off her heels and thrust her feet into his lap, nearly toppling the bottle of lotion. *""Your turn,* servant. *And don’t think I’ll go easy on you.""*

David swallowed. Emma’s smirk lingered as he shifted to Charlotte’s feet, his fingers working faster, harder—trying to outdo the memory of Emma’s approval. The women’s conversation buzzed above him: some party, someone’s ex, a dress Charlotte *had* to borrow. His existence reduced to the press of his palms against skin.

Then Emma giggled, swirling her wine. *""Hmm. Not* quite *as good as mine was.""*

Charlotte’s foot stiffened under his hands.

*""Look at me,""* she commanded. David obeyed, his neck cracking as he lifted his gaze. With deliberate slowness, she hooked a finger into the lace of her thong—still damp from his saliva after she’d gagged him with it earlier—and tugged it free. *""Tongue,* David. *Let’s see if* that *makes you better.""*

The room shrunk to the throb of his pulse, the sour tang of fabric still on his tongue. Emma’s smile didn’t waver.

*""Well?""* Charlotte tapped her foot against his chest. *""Or do I need to* force *you again?""*

A pause. Then, trembling, he leaned down.

 

The air in the apartment was thick with the scent of Charlotte’s lavender foot cream—a luxury David had been sent to buy earlier that day, only for her to sneer at the brand he’d chosen. Now, kneeling on the hardwood floor, his knees already aching, he pressed his thumbs into the arch of her right foot, his tongue working in slow, wet circles over the left.

Charlotte lounged on the sofa, one arm draped over Emma’s shoulders, her toes flexing against David’s mouth. “Mmm, *better*,” she murmured, wiggling her foot deeper. “But you’re still too tense. Imagine you’re *enjoying* this.”

A bead of sweat dripped from David’s temple onto her instep. He didn’t wipe it away.

Emma watched, her chin propped on her hand, eyes half-lidded. “Oh, you’ll have to do mine next time,” she said, tapping ash from her cigarette into David’s abandoned coffee cup. “Consider this… training.” Her laugh was light, melodic. “Charlotte’s just breaking you in.”

Charlotte’s heel dug into David’s collarbone. “*Focus.*”

He obeyed, lapping at the crevices between her toes, the salt-sour tang of sweat and lotion coating his tongue. His jaw ached, but he didn’t stop—couldn’t stop. Stopping meant *disappointing them*, and disappointment meant…

*That time Charlotte made him chew her used gum for an hour because he’d folded her blouses wrong.*

A shudder ran through him.

“Tongue tired already?” Charlotte cooed, tilting her head. “Poor thing. Let’s *help* you.” She yanked his hair back, forcing him to look up. “Stick it out. *Far*.”

David complied, his tongue jutting between his lips like a dog panting.

Charlotte grinned, sliding her foot forward until her toes pressed against his tongue, grinding the tender muscle between them. “There. Now *you* don’t have to work so hard.” She rotated her foot, smearing his saliva between her toes. “Just stay *still*.”

Emma giggled, swirling her wine. “God, you’re *good* at this.”

David’s throat convulsed as Charlotte’s foot pushed deeper, the taste of leather from her sandals and something faintly metallic—blood? Dirt?—filling his mouth.

“*Swallow*,” Charlotte ordered, pressing down. “Swallow whatever filth you just scraped off me.”

He did, the gulp audible.

When she finally pulled away, David’s tongue hung limp, his lips chapped. “Th-thank you,” he rasped, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. “For the… lesson.”

Emma stretched, rising from the couch. “Alright, off to bed, David.” She ruffled his hair like he was a child. “Charlotte and I have *adult* things to discuss.” Her smile sharpened. “Not that you’d understand.”

Charlotte smirked, examining her freshly moisturized toes. “Sweet dreams, *servant*.”

David nodded, shuffling toward the couch—*his* bed, ever since Emma had claimed his room’s closet for her “shoe archive.” As he lay down, their whispers slithered after him:

“—think he *liked* it?”  
“Oh, absolutely. Did you see how hard he—”

The rest dissolved into laughter.

David turned his face into the cushion.

And *bit down*—*hard*—until the fabric tore.

 

 

The next day

Emma’s key turned in the lock, and David’s spine stiffened on instinct. He hadn’t meant to sit down. He hadn’t meant to turn on the TV. But for just ten minutes, he’d let himself zone out to the buzz of some forgettable game show, his mind blissfully empty.

The door slammed.

""Oh, wow."" Her voice was honey-laced venom. ""This is what you do now? Lounge around like some retired housecat?""

David scrambled to mute the TV, but Emma was faster. She snatched the remote and killed the screen with a click, plunging the room into silence.

""You didn’t drop out of school to rot on the couch, David,"" she said, tossing her backpack into his lap. ""There’s always work to do. Always. My laundry, the windows, proper vacuuming—Christ, you could’ve even texted me to ask if I needed anything. But no. This is how you spend your time?""

He opened his mouth—an apology, an excuse—but she was already dragging him up by the wrist. ""We’re checking your work. Now.""

  
Her fingers trailed along the countertop, coming away with a dusting of crumbs. ""Disgusting,"" she murmured. Then, without warning, she grabbed the back of his neck and shoved his face against the granite. ""See that? See it?"" Her breath was hot in his ear. ""That’s filth, David. And you missed it.""

The wine bottle sat unopened on the counter. She picked it up, made a show of examining the label, then sighed. ""Ugh. This is the cheap one. I told you—""

""The store was out of the other—""

""Then you go to another store,"" she snapped. ""Or do I need to spell out every little thing for you?""

She yanked him by the hair to her closet, where her boots stood in polished rows. ""At least these are acceptable,"" she conceded, running a finger along the suede. Then, softer: ""You do care about how I look, don’t you?""

He nodded, pulse thudding.

A single leaf—brittle, brown—nestled in the corner. Emma’s smile was glacial. ""Oh, David."" She forced him to his knees, pressing his cheek to the tile until the edge bit into his skin. ""What’s this?""

""I—I’m sorry. I must’ve missed it.""

She released him with a sigh. ""You did try your best, didn’t you?"" Her hand carded through his hair, almost tender. For a fleeting second, warmth bloomed in his chest. She noticed. She knows I tried.

Then her nails scraped his scalp. ""But it can’t happen again. Understand? You quit school to make both our lives easier. Mine especially.""

 

Emma perched on the arm of the couch, one leg swinging lazily over the other, her ballet flat dangling precariously from her toes as if she might kick it off at any moment. She watched David with the amused detachment of a queen addressing her court jester—except this was no joke. This was law.

""Let’s make something very clear,"" she began, her voice syrupy sweet, ""from now on, my comfort is your full-time occupation. No more half-assed efforts. No more forgetting."" She reached out, tapping a single manicured nail against his temple. ""This little brain of yours? It only thinks about me now. Understood?""

David nodded, his throat dry.

""Good. Now, let’s go over the details—because apparently, I have to spell everything out for you.""

**1. Groceries & Meals**  
""You’ll check the fridge every morning before I wake up,"" she said, counting off on her fingers. ""If my yogurt is running low, you go immediately. None of that ‘I’ll get it later’ nonsense. And if the store is out? You try the next one. And the next. Until you find it.""

She tilted her head, considering. ""Actually, you should just memorize the inventory. Keep a list in your phone. I shouldn’t have to tell you when we’re out of things.""

A pause. Then, with a smirk: ""Oh, and no more cheap wine. If I want a bottle, you’ll get the exact one I like. If you have to call five liquor stores, so be it.""

**2. Laundry & Clothing Maintenance**  
Emma crossed her legs, leaning forward with mock sympathy. ""I know laundry is hard for you, so let’s break it down, hm?""

* ""Whites and colors separate. No exceptions.""
* ""My silk blouses? Hand wash only. And don’t you dare wring them out—lay them flat to dry.""
* ""Charlotte’s lace things? Same rules. But extra gentle. If you snag one thread, you’re buying her a new set.""

She grinned. ""And ironing? No wrinkles. Ever. I don’t care if you have to stay up all night steaming out creases.""

**3. Cleaning Standards**  
""The balcony today was unacceptable,"" she said, her voice dropping to a dangerous purr. ""From now on? I want to be able to eat off those tiles. Literally. If I dropped a grape out there, I should be able to pick it up and pop it in my mouth without a second thought.""

Her eyes flicked toward the kitchen. ""Same goes for the counters. If I ever catch you leaving crumbs again, you’ll be scrubbing the grout with a toothbrush for a week.""

 

Emma’s smile widened. ""Now, here’s the fun part.""

**4. On-Demand Service**  
""If I text you ‘come here’, you drop everything. No excuses. If you’re in the middle of washing my hairbrush? Leave it. Cooking? Turn off the stove. Sleeping? Wake up.""

She giggled. ""Actually, you should just keep your phone on loud at all times. I hate being ignored.""

**5. The Lending Program**  
""Like I said, I might lend you out to my friends,"" she mused, twirling a strand of hair around her finger. ""Charlotte’s place is a pigsty, and honestly? It’d be good for you. More practice. More… discipline.""

She leaned in, her voice dropping to a whisper. ""Imagine it—you, on your knees, scrubbing her floors. Folding her laundry. Maybe even hand-feeding her grapes while she studies. Wouldn’t that be hilarious?""

David’s stomach turned.

""Oh, don’t look so sour,"" she cooed, pinching his cheek. ""It’s good for you. Builds character.""

Emma sighed, as if this part was the biggest burden of all.

""The least you can do is act like you enjoy this,"" she said, rolling her eyes. ""I don’t want some mopey zombie following me around. Smile more. Ask me how my day was. Offer to massage my feet before I have to ask.""

She tilted his chin up with one finger. ""You’re lucky I’m even letting you do this. Most people wouldn’t tolerate someone as useless as you. But me? I’m patient. I’m kind.""

Her thumb brushed his lower lip. ""So thank me.""

A beat.

""...Thank you, Emma.""

""Good boy."" Emma stretched, then stood, smoothing out her skirt. ""Now. I’m starving. You’ll make me that risotto—the one with wild mushrooms, not the cheap ones—and this time?""

About me: I'm 23 and I go to school for forensics. I like to play games (board games, video games, dnd, etc.), watch horror movies, go thrifting (I'm really into fashion/style), try new coffee/tea places, write, skate and take hikes/walks. 

I'm 6'1, skinny, tan skin, curly brown hair to my shoulders, brown eyes, and I usually dress more alternative/goth/dark.

So far, it’s been a roller coaster ride. Hoping to make some friends to hopefully bite the bullet and meetup with eventually. 

A little about me, I’m introverted and meeting people in a large group can be overwhelming at times for me. I’m also a Pacific Islander, if that makes much of a difference 😂 I’m currently working full time hours that are outside normal working hours. I’m a gamer but since moving here I haven’t been able to do any of that the last couple of months. Lack of a place to stay (I live with extended family) at the moment is kind of putting a damper on those plans right now. So, I’m hoping to find a few mates to go out and maybe bowl, play pool, go to an arcade, driving range, or just a good ol’ movie with or have a coffee or something. 

Apart from gaming, I like a bunch of things like the true crime, music, anime (though not super die hard or anything), good food, paranormal, history, and other random things I can’t think of right now.

1jy6yab,https://www.reddit.com/r/the_players_lounge/comments/1jy6yab/bangkok_city_report/,Bangkok city report,"\- About me : Caucasian male, early 30s, 6 feet tall

\- Bangkok logistics : Bangkok is a huge city with many areas but most foreigners stay around the sukhumvit area. I'll break it down : Chit Lom / Phloen Chit BTS stations are near the malls and a bit of an upscale area. Nana / Asok are very touristy BTS stations with a bit of a whoremonger vibe. Prices in the restaurants are at least 2x what you would normally pay. Phrom Phong is another upscale area which is quite nice. Thong Lor / Ekkamai are two other famous upscale areas, especially Thong Lor which is famous for its hipster restaurants and rooftops. The BTS stations after thoseare less upscale but you could still stay at Phra Khanong BTS station or even further if you don't have enough budget. Apart from sukhumvit, there's also the Silom area which is quite nice and a bit more corporate. Also there is Kao San Road, the backpacker area, if you're into meeting backpackers and partying. 

\- Thai women appearance : Thai women are taller than Filipinas and more attractive. Some have mixed chinese blood. There are also a lot of ladyboys in Bangkok but they are usually quite upfront about it so no need to worry, except in nightclubs it can be hard to differentiate them due to the low lighting. 

\- Dating : Dating apps that work best here are Tinder, Bumble, and Thaifriendly. Thaifriendly has a lot of freelancers but you can also find some gems still. I would say though that Tinder and Bumble are your best bets. Thai women are a bit gold-diggerish in how they will judge where you live so that's why it's important to stay in an upscale area. Apart from that some thai women will insist on dinner but personally I never agree to these kind of dates, I only accept coffee dates or bar dates. Thai women are quite fun to date, some will even come back directly from the BTS station to my condominium, although some will need a date first.

\- Nightlife : There are multiple nightlife areas, first there is Kao San Road with many backpackers and tourists. Then there is Thong lor, which has mostly thai people in upscale clubs. Then there is Asoke / Nana with the whoremongers and many freelancers. Finally there is the Siam area which is quite nice. 

Conclusion : Thai women are quite fun to date and you can get a decent amount of matches on dating apps. Bangkok is a very vibrant city with many things to do, including its food, its nightlife and the ladies of course.

1jy6v65,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1jy6v65/the_coffee_incident_and_the_silent_treatment/,The Coffee Incident and the Silent Treatment,"Throwaway account for reasons.

To give you some context, I share a room in a building with communal areas. The person I want to talk about is one of my roommates, and honestly, I struggle to explain the dynamic. So, I'll share a few specific encounters with him.

The first time I entered the room, we had a brief, standard welcome chat with everyone. Not even five minutes into the conversation, this guy suddenly asks me: ""I'm sorry to ask, but it's really important if you're going to be living here. Are you homophobic?""

The question completely caught me off guard. It felt very serious and confrontational right off the bat. My initial thought was that a simple ""no"" would sound too... flat. Knowing that my other roommates and I often joke around (it's part of our culture back home, which he doesn't share), I tried to lighten the mood with a gentle joke. I said something like, ""Depends on how many of you are gay, haha, nah, it's all good, I'm not homophobic."" He then explained his reasoning: ""Every time I tell people I'm gay, they say, 'it's okay as long as you don't touch me.' So I want to make sure you're not homophobic.""

Honestly, that just left me with an uncomfortable feeling. The conversation, especially with him, continued, and he turned out to be very political, which I usually don't mind. However, his way of discussing things felt quite incisive, almost like he was trying to corner me into agreeing with something I didn't. The political talk mostly revolved around the typical left vs. right, communist vs. capitalist dichotomy. I was just sharing my personal viewpoints when he very sharply stated, ""So you're a communist."" I told him I don't like those labels; I don't get offended if someone calls me one or the other, but I find it judgmental.

At this point, our conversations were generally okay, though I still didn't appreciate the way he steered them.

Then, considering we live in a first-world country, he would occasionally launch into rants about how it's full of right-wing people, how much he hates it, and how he wishes bad things on everyone here. He also insults them, calling them autists. He also expressed strong animosity towards white people, giving lots of reasons for his hatred. I'm generally open to discussing different viewpoints and always try to bring a bit of hope into our chats, like pointing out that things aren't all bad and there are good people out there too, but with him, it felt impossible to have a productive conversation.

One night, as we were all getting ready for bed, he asked me completely out of the blue: ""Do you think you can wash my hair in a non-homosexual way?""

I was genuinely shocked and didn't even know how to respond. I simply refused, to which he replied, ""I thought I could count on you."" Then he went to sleep, seemingly offended as if I had done something wrong to him.

One day, I had worked a night shift at a nightclub. The next day when I woke up, all the roommates were in the room. He immediately asked me, ""Did you take drugs?"" I laughed a bit and said, ""No, haha, I didn't."" He then continued, ""No ecstasy? Speed?"" I replied no. He persisted, ""Sure? No MDMA? No cocaine?"" Again, I said no, really, I hadn't taken anything. He kept asking over and over, and then said, ""You know that if you have a problem, you can talk with us"" (bear in mind, he's not someone I have any real closeness with to actually ask for help). The problem was, I kept refusing kindly and with patience, but he insisted and insisted to the point where I snapped and told him, ""What you're doing is very fascist-like. You're accusing me over and over of something I didn't do until I fake admit to it, and then you'll probably blame me for it.""

Another day, I was talking with another roommate around midday. We were keeping our voices down because he was asleep. We were discussing a (terrible) new job I had just started. He woke up and declared, ""There's no more peace in this room. One can't sleep without being woken up. And we *know* you're RICH, you have two jobs, you talk about it *every single day*... yes, we know, you have lots and lots of money."" I wasn't sure if he was being sarcastic, but it didn't come across as a joke. I honestly think he believes I'm wealthy. For the record, the two awful minimum wage jobs I have are the kind anyone could get.

Another thing that bothers me is how he constantly asks for things like coffee and cigarettes. I don't mind sharing when I have it, even though I'm currently very short on money. The issue is the way he asks – it's not appreciative, just a demanding ""Do you have coffee?"" while holding out a mug. My breaking point came after sharing my coffee with him for three days. The last day, he went around telling everyone how he hadn't had breakfast but had three coffees instead. That felt really insulting. He definitely doesn't *need* the coffee; he's just taking advantage of it being free.

The next day, he asked me for coffee again. I replied, ""It costs money,"" implying that it costs *me* money to buy. I guess he thought I was charging him directly, so he asked, ""How much is it? How much do you charge me?"" ""$2,"" I said. He got angry and retorted that he could buy one from the coffee machine for that price. I told him he could buy it there then. He then called me a capitalist, and I responded, ""Sometimes I'm communist, sometimes I'm capitalist."" It wasn't a shouting match, just a normal-toned conversation.

Someone overheard our exchange, felt sorry for him, and got him a coffee from the machine. Then, this guy had the audacity to say, ""Nooo, I wanted black coffee, not milk coffee."" Realizing how rude that sounded, he then quickly added, ""it's okay, don't worry, any coffee is good.""

Here's where the problem escalates. After that, he completely stopped talking to me. His behavior makes it seem like he actively dislikes being near me. I still say ""hello"" when I see him, but he just ignores me and acts extremely offended. Sometimes we share food or snacks in our room, and it becomes incredibly uncomfortable because he seems to resent me receiving anything from others. I always make sure everyone else has had enough before accepting anything myself, and I often decline multiple times before accepting if they insist.

One of the other roommates told me that he's been talking about me. He's apparently offended that I tried to ""charge"" him for coffee, and he even dislikes me because I'm a reserved person and don't talk much. He even calls me autist for not talking much, which I find really disgusting. That's just my personality; I've always been this way and never thought it would be a problem.

Looking back, I think it might have been a mistake to just say ""it costs money."" I probably should have been more direct and explained the real reason I didn't want to give him my coffee. But I'm unsure how much of a straightforward conversation I can even have with him.

I'm not trying to sound overly dramatic or anything, but honestly, I feel like I should probably move out of this place just so I don't keep annoying him. The way he talks and behaves shows that he's not really open to changing his own perspective, so I don't think we can ever have a proper dialogue. The best solution for my peace of mind would be to move out... but unfortunately, I'm just not in a financial position to do that right now.

I just wanted to vent and share this story... not really sure what kind of advice I can even get here. Maybe how I should approach him next time, if he ever stops ignoring me. Honestly, I'm a bit afraid of getting his attention because he might explode. I'm sure in his head I'm one of his 'enemies' - the capitalist, autistic, rich white person.

Some context I am planning on picking her up around 7 AM and taking her back at 3 PM.

Long story short I have been texting this girl for two months who is still in college in LA (I graduated in December and moved to Chicago). She is an adventurous girl who luckily has a parent from Chicago whose parents still live here so she will be visiting them and carving out some time to see me. I would not say I am infatuated by her but there just seems to be something different about her and I genuinely brighten up when I open her texts (isn’t that always the case lol). We have been texting, voice memoing and facetimed once since feb almost everyday. She is coming to Chicago (where I moved) to visit relatives and we have a date penciled in for next Saturday. My idea as of right now is to either get coffee/pastries or breakfast then go to the zoo then lunch and go from there. Really look to genuinely get to know her more and am open to any feedback on ideas. 
 
Also, roommate suggested flowers but I definitely feel I am jumping the gun there since one shes visiting and two a but overwhelming on the first date. Focused on this date but also keeping in mind I will visit LA in two months. Any Chicago date ideas for this time frame, feedback on idea is greatly appreciated.

We’ve all had those days—when the alarm feels louder, the coffee tastes weaker, and your mood slumps before the day even gets started. While occasional bad moods are part of life, staying stuck in them doesn’t have to be. The good news is that with some simple actions, you can lift your mood and set a positive tone for the rest of the day.

# Simple Mood Boosters to Brighten Your Day

When you’re feeling low, making even the smallest shift in your actions can have a huge positive impact on your mood. The key is to lean into activities that naturally spark happiness. Here are a few of the most effective mood boosters to try when you need to move from bad to better.

# Get Moving

https://preview.redd.it/n41iatszklue1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=b66af952f1dcc14388f5c5861f2380b3168d09cc

Physical movement is one of the quickest ways to boost your mood. Why? [**Exercise**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/exercise-energy-and-mood-understanding-the-connection/) releases endorphins, chemicals in your brain often referred to as “feel-good hormones.” You don’t need to commit to an intense workout either—something as small as a 10-minute walk around the block can work wonders.

**Try some of these movement tips to brighten your day:**

* Take a brisk walk or stretch for five minutes at your desk.
* Dance around your living room to your favorite upbeat song.
* Do simple yoga poses like Child’s Pose, Downward Dog, or Cat-Cow to relax and stretch.

# Breathe and Meditate

Take a moment to focus on your breathing, which can help calm anxieties and improve your mental clarity. Deep breathing not only reduces stress but also improves your body’s oxygen levels, giving you both physical and emotional relief.

* Try box breathing: inhale for four seconds, hold for four seconds, exhale for four seconds, and hold for four seconds before repeating.
* Use a guided meditation app like Calm or Headspace, which offers short meditations specifically designed to tackle a bad day.

Even just five minutes of intentional breathing or [**meditation**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/a-beautiful-mind-and-life-with-meditation/) can reset your emotional state.

# Visualize

Visualization is a powerful tool that’s often used by high-performing athletes, but it works for everyone. By picturing something positive, your brain releases dopamine, giving you a boost of happiness.

**Here’s how to use visualization:**

* Close your eyes and imagine a moment that makes you truly happy—like lying on a breezy beach or laughing with friends.
* Visualize a future achievement or scenario that excites you, like hitting a personal milestone or going on an exciting vacation.

This simple mental exercise can redirect your focus and improve your overall outlook.

# Listen to Music

https://preview.redd.it/71nuakc1llue1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=62998345e8d700986dd65d0077ab20813a74b6a4

Music holds the remarkable power to change your mood in an instant. A lively song with an upbeat tempo can have you smiling before the first chorus hits, while a soothing melody can calm your nerves after a stressful day.

**Tips to uplift yourself with** [**music:**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/tap-into-the-powerful-effects-of-music/)

* Create a playlist of your favorite happy tunes for moments when you need a lift.
* Experiment with genres—sometimes upbeat jazz, classical, or even nature sounds can be soothing.

Plug in your headphones, hit play, and feel your spirits rise.

# Connect with Someone You Love

When our minds are heavy, talking to someone who makes us feel loved can lighten the load. Opening up to a close friend, family member, or partner can help you process emotions and feel supported.

* Call or video chat a loved one to catch up, even if it’s just for 10 minutes.
* Send a quick text message to a friend you’ve been meaning to reconnect with.

Not every conversation needs to be deep—sometimes a little casual chatting can do wonders for your mood.

# Give

https://preview.redd.it/t8d2jj73llue1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9a67bea5fc58886e3593e9b5c254ee8aaf94a6c

Science shows that acts of kindness can boost your overall happiness. It can be as simple as paying a compliment to a co-worker, holding the door open for someone, or writing a heartfelt note to a friend or loved one.

**Ideas to spread kindness and improve your mood:**

* [**Volunteer**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/how-volunteering-can-boost-your-mood-and-well-being/) at a local shelter or community center.
* Buy a coffee for the person behind you in line at the café.
* Donate clothes or items you no longer need to charity.

The joy of giving creates an emotional ripple effect, benefiting both you and others.

# Laugh

It’s no secret that [**laughter**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/the-added-value-of-laughter/) is one of the best medicines. It releases endorphins almost immediately and can relieve physical tension, leaving you feeling both happier and more relaxed.

Need a quick laugh? Try this:

* Watch a funny video or sitcom. (Animal bloopers and stand-up comedy never fail!)
* Recall a funny memory or joke that always brings a smile to your face.
* Spend time around friends or family members who make you laugh.

Even cracking a smile forces your mood in an upward direction, so don’t be afraid to giggle unapologetically.

# Step into Nature

https://preview.redd.it/bq08ugn5llue1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2d8b5f9d92ae7693cbda5cdb71f770e7730c7be

Nature offers an incredible calming effect. Spending time outdoors can improve concentration, lift your mood, and reduce feelings of anxiety.

Try these tips for reconnecting with the natural world:

* Take a short walk in a nearby park.
* Bring your coffee or tea outside and enjoy it in your backyard or a sunny spot near a window.
* Plant flowers, herbs, or vegetables and bask in the joy of caring for something alive.

[**Fresh air and sunshine**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/the-value-of-spending-time-in-nature/) have a way of clearing the mind and softening any stress.

What it really was.  I'm trying to remember the last time we really saw each other.  The last time was my car, parking lot, but I mean spent the day together..... I'm afraid... you know what im afraid of.  I feel like it's already happening.  This is just me getting my thoughts out in the morning calmly.  I don't have the kind of hurt that makes you react. However each person reacts to pain.  Im not wallowing.  My tears fall silently, there's no sobbing.  Usually there's no sobbing 😅  I'm not happy, but not unhappy to the point I can't go on.  I've grown, once again, physically and mentally since you've really seen me.  I just miss you 🤷‍♂️.  There's a reason, it persists.  It's real. It was.  I was real.  I meant it and it was true.  You are such an amazing person that I've loved you for my whole life.  You've helped me to change, fundamentally.  Which isn't an easy thing for anyone to do. Almost impossible.  I'll always be here.  You can count on that.  Once again-- Me being alone, doesn't mean me being miserable. Just.....baby if it's not you, I don't want it.  And that's okay.  You look beautiful today.  I'm sorry I talked too much, I was proud I pulled it all off. Although now I'm wondering if I did it right.  I won't speak unless you do.  Don't want to upset you seph.  There are no lengths I won't go to for you.  I am your ""friend"" whatever dumb words we people use.  All i am is someone who cares about you, more than anything.  My NDE's,  first when I was born dead, then 3 years ago,  i do feel things.  Understand some things.  Sensitive to things.  And when I'm near you....  its undeniable.  It's magnets.  That doesn't mean we can't control ourselves.  I guess what my hope is,  is the chance to show you how strong I can be for you.  There will never come a day I wouldn't drop everything, just to bring you coffee and really help your back. I'm rambling now.  Hope the kiddos are okay.  I hope you're safe.  I wish we could get in the hot tub, gotta feeling we both could use it.  Would be the perfect opportunity for me to show you the resolve and strength I'm capable of too.  Love you, sugarbutt.  Keep your head up and on a swivel. Plz....if you find out...I won't do a thing...not even drive by....lmk.  All, Always.

Kendu’s We Don’t Gamble, We Work perfectly encapsulates the drive, determination and unbreakable will power that the community has. Kendu is not about trying to jump from phase to phase, it is about growing sustainably and in a way that is healthy. At Kendu we aren’t looking for a cheeky 10x, we are looking for the tens of billions. This may seem delusional, but I believe with all my heart that Kendu will get there. Shib managed to 1000x in 36 days going from 22 million to 22 billion, if a meme can do that in 2021 with far less money in crypto, imagine what Kendu can achieve. Kendu could reach Shib’s ATH mc with far, far less attention due to there being more money in crypto.

All Shib and Pepe had was a community, that is all you need to go the top, so it has been proven that community defines the value of a memecoin, so why would you bet against the strongest community in crypto?

All Shib and Pepe had was a community, that is all you need to go the top.

As AI use increases memes will lose their value, it is no longer a human carefully crafting a meme, it is AI churning out 3000 an hour.

**So what will make a coin stand out?**

 

IRL alpha

 

**Why?**

 

Because IRL products/events cannot be faked and this is where Kendu’s strength is unprecedented. From India to Florida Kendu dominates. We have Pickleball in India and we are onto our 3^(rd) Festival in Florida…Yes you read that correctly. Our third festival.  
In this festivals we have given out a few thousand energy drinks(Kendu Energy), merch and made murals.

Very soon, we our attending the Florida Grove Festival in Orlando and a new mural will be created!!!!!!!!!

Our past Florida events were Miami Art Basel and Miami Music Week!

In India we are hosting glow in the dark Pickleball which is ran by Kendu Entertainment(ran by a chad called Ishan). Pickleball is very popular in India and gets a lot of attention. The Kendu community spirit shines through!



Here is a list of the IRL products:

* Kendu Energy
* Kendu Coffee
* Kendu Merch
* Kendu animation
* Kendu games
* Kendu Gum
* Kendu Creator( a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online)
* Kendu pendants
* Kendu Beer
* Kendu Video Games
* Kendu Games(a boardgame)
* Tattoos
* Murals



We don’t see Kendu as just a meme, we see it as a brand!!!

What have we achieved?

* 18k holders
* 50k certik votes, only other coin to ever achieve this is Pepe.
* 283 million ATH market cap
* Extremely active telegram and social media scores
* A rating on certik 
* International community 
* Coinbase advertisement



My advice and obviously do your own research is to skip the luxuries for a few weeks, like skip a daily Redbull for a few weeks and put that $30 into Kendu or maybe skip a few Papa Johns.  
If Kendu reaches 10 billion, that $30 will become $30,000. You won’t miss the pizza, but you will heavily regret not investing.

I advise everyone to at least join our telegram and hang around a bit, you don’t have to buy a bag, just see if you like our vibe. Any questions are always welcome!!!

We also have a subreddit: [r/KenduInu\_Ecosystem](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/), but our telegram is way busier.

Another thing you can do is compare our tg activity to other coins, we literally outperform those with 30x the market cap. YES we are that strong

Join the winning team, join Kendu!!!

The 1930s house decor is a captivating blend of elegance, functionality, and artistic expression. This era, marked by the Great Depression, influenced design choices that prioritized comfort and practicality without sacrificing style. Homeowners embraced a mix of traditional craftsmanship and emerging modern aesthetics, creating spaces that were both inviting and reflective of the times.

Color palettes from the 1930s often featured muted tones such as taupe, olive green, and soft blues, interspersed with vibrant accents. Wallpapers were popular, often showcasing geometric patterns or floral designs, which helped add character to living spaces. The use of textiles during this period also played a significant role in home decoration, with heavy drapes and cozy upholstery contributing to a warm ambiance.

Furniture design in the 1930s emphasized comfort and durability. Pieces were typically made of hardwoods and featured curvilinear shapes that encouraged relaxation. Popular items included overstuffed sofas, Art Deco-inspired coffee tables, and upholstered chairs that became focal points in living rooms. The incorporation of subtle artistic elements, like inlays and carvings, showcased the craftsmanship characteristic of this era.

Kitchen design saw a shift towards functionality, with built-in cabinetry and light, airy spaces becoming the standard. Essential appliances, such as refrigerators and stoves, were designed with streamlined aesthetics that complemented the overall decor. The dining area often featured well-crafted tables that served as a gathering spot for families, reinforcing the era's emphasis on togetherness.

Incorporating 1930s house decor into modern homes can create an appealing vintage charm. Accessories such as antique lamps, period artwork, and retro dinnerware evoke a sense of nostalgia and celebrate the sophistication of the decade. By blending contemporary elements with these classic designs, homeowners can enjoy a uniquely stylish atmosphere that pays homage to a remarkable period in history.

Me and my girlfriend recently moved in this apartment, close to 3 months. With rent and other expenses, we haven't been able to decorate nor plan better our layout.

We would really like to hear any ideas on what to put and where, as well as any tips for the layout.

Currently, you are looking at a simple L-shaped couch, a wooden coffee table, a tv stand with 3 levels, a smaller coffee table (we call it the crack table), a record player, two amps and a bass barely taking space there. On the last image, the other half of the living room, a long dinner table resides with an old fireplace.

We are very open to shelves and plants! We had a library laying sideways where the bass is at, but relocated it to a better spot, leaving us with this awkward void.

My best friend and I are 38. We have been talking about taking this trip together since we were 20 years old. My friend and I talk on the phone about 3-5 days of the week but we have lived two hours apart for about 10 years. Now that our children are old enough to stay home without us, we are finally making the trip happen! Just the two of us! I am so excited! The past 8 years have been exceptionally difficult for both of us as we have dealt with hardships of parenting, marriage, and loss of parents. So this trip will be incredibly meaningful and healing for us both, on so many levels. 

We will be in Seattle/Bellevue area staying with some of my family for 3 days. Our plan is to spend a day in the city and go to Pike Place Market, and then go hiking and sight seeing on the other days. 

Here is where I need your help! I have been to Seattle many times but my last trip was over 6 years ago. 
I want to know if there are any new spots or hidden gems that we should explore? Places that are new or old or overlooked? A neat shop to sit and get coffee with a view or cozy design? Best place to grab a quick bite or fancy dinner? Have a favorite shop with unique goods? Any experiences or locations for a good view? Great art shops or cafes? Any crafting places where we could make a memento? Horse back riding? Places to dance for old people like us? Anything else that I am not thinking of?

Recap:
Long time best friends can finally clear the time and have the money to travel together to Seattle and want to make the very best of it! 

No one knows the spots like a local, so I am reaching out to you, redditors of Seattle! Thanks in advance and Im sooo excited to be coming to visit soon!

I (F30) have been in a relationship with my gf (F35) for the last 4 months. I think everything was fine up until very recently when my partner made strange comments.

When she said that I kind of brushed it off saying it’s just I have a different family dynamic and she might find it weird but it’s my normal. 

The next comment was when we move in together whether I am going to be spending 3 nights away from her. I kinda thought well I am not sure because I’ll be living in the house I am buying and not sure how it’ll all pan out. Further comments were made about my social media platform I have a huge following and a whole manager who does rely on me to make money so I have to be on my phone a lot and make content. When I’m with her I avoid using my phone much to pay attention and spend quality time together but she recently made a comment that she thinks I’m always on my phone which I know I’m not. 

The one thing she said which I shut down straightaway was we were having conversations about going on holiday and I stated that I wanna go solo travelling as I have done it before and it’s something I enjoy and want to do whether I’m single or in a relationship she proceeded to say that she finds it “weird” I said I don’t agree with the comment and it’s something I want to do so I’m gonna do it regardless.

It feels like I’m being accused of things I don’t even know about. I’m not sure there is much to salvage though we have had amazing memories but I think it’s something that’ll probably be the cause of a bigger issue in the future. 

Plus she texts me all the time but I can’t respond on time because I’m either busy working, spending time with my friends or family. Even when I have clarified that I’m spending a day with friends/family she texts me and calls me which I find so annoying like have some consideration, she gets upset when I don’t respond on time and it feels like she accuses me of things.

I work nights for the railroad. I'm a mechanic. Sitting at a coffee shop at 6AM today (est) after my shift, I was struck with a desire to go at least witness a catholic sermon. I stumbled through the whole thing, head down, panicking. I didn't know the rules. I could tell everyone knew I was a filthy mechanic who's never been to church. Time comes for communion and I stumble along with the crowd. I'm offered communion and I begin to turn away, and the woman asked me if I could consume, and I took this literally. Stuck it to the roof of my mouth and stumbled out of the church frantically apologizing under my breath. Sped away home. Decided I would find out how screwed I am and apparently I have committed sacrilege. 

Again. I am not christian. Never have been. But I feel like I have to do something to make right by these people. I basically came into a holy place and damned myself on accident.

I wouldn't worry, because again, I am agnostic. But I have now committed what I now understand to be a mortal sin in front of much of a city's catholic community and I feel as though I have woefully disrespected the sanctity of these people's day of rest. I'm so sorry.

I've recently moved to a new city and am still in the process of trying to meet new people and create friendships. 

I've joined an improv community which has been really great for meeting new people and connecting quickly and easily in a place where you can be goofy and vulnerable. There are two people I guess I have found it the easiest to connect with, and it took me a few weeks to realise that they were actually married to each other. I had only really had interactions with them as individuals, and it never came up that they were married. 

I've been loosely looking to make plans to catch up with the guy, he seems cool and we connect over a fair few things. 

My question is - is it weird to reach out to his wife to also be her friend outside of improv? 

I like her too, she's super easy to talk to and I'd love to be her friend. If she weren't married, or married to someone I didn't know, I don't think I'd question it as much just reaching out to her and seeing if she wanted to get coffee sometime or whatever. 

But because I know her husband, for some reason it feels different. Do I have to ask him permission to be friends with his wife? That feels weird. But it also kind of feels weird me reaching out to her without him knowing about it. I don't know haha, I'm overthinking it. 

What do you guys think? I've made it clear to both of them that I like both of them, would like to hang out with both of them, but he always seems to be angling for more of a one on one style hang out. Which suits me fine, I'd like to hang out with him, but I'd like to hang out with her too!

Started having sex with each other over a year ago and from all that time I can say I like it. It's nice. He is a very open minded person, lovely approach, open conversations, would go down on me, didn't care much about body hair if I happened to leave some. 

It is just not worth it. He puts effort in too, buys most of our condoms and lube, shaves his face to not irritate my skin. I still feel like it's a lot of effort from my part. I hop in the shower, shave my legs, armpits, privates. Doll myself up. I take extra care of my feet cause he loves them. I went on contraception (vaginal ring) so I literally shove a foreign object up my body every month and let it stay there so we could be comfortable. I invite him into my home, and deal with the aftermath of hanging around my flatmates knowing we just hooked up. From all the activities my face is always irritated, sometimes my privates as well.

The activity itself is nice. But not worth it at all. He can get me off but not always so it's also a gamble of whether it will be fulfilling or end in me having to first communicate not being satisfied and then deal with the shitty feeling. It also takes so much time I would honestly just rather spend doing other things. It's kind of an equivalent of liking coffee shops but living in the country. Sure treating myself for a coffee would be nice but I'm not gonna spend an hour in the car and all that money for gas just to get it!

I'm not asexual. I used to have a very high sex drive for both activities, fantasizing and masturbation. It's only the latter recently and even that way, way less.

I'm not sure what to do about it, how to say all this once he inevitably brings up how long it's been since we were intimate, especially since it used to be me complaining about the low frequency of sex. From outside perspective it seems miserable. I find myself being horny for women I see, telling myself maybe with a woman I would be happier, would feel less shame after sex and more fulfillment from giving pleasure, could go off contraception and see what it feels like to ovulate. I also love him and was ready to spend many more years with him.

1jy6bws,https://www.reddit.com/r/DSPD/comments/1jy6bws/first_time_discovering_this_thread_advice_needed/,First time discovering this thread - advice needed,"Hi. I'm honestly surprised it's taken me this long to consider whether I have an actual problem with my circadian rhythm, but now that I'm in my late thirties, my sleep patterns haven't changed and the effects are getting worse. So much worse, in fact, that I fear I'm destroying my brain and body.

For about half of my career, I've had to get up in 5s or 6s for work. This was due to early start times and long commutes. During these phases of life, my mental health has suffered immensely. But this was mostly in my twenties, when I simply had more energy and could 'push through' it. Now it's getting much harder to push through.

The most recent example is my current work schedule. Back in August it was changed from having to get to work around 10am, which worked perfectly, to 8am. This means getting up around 5:30-6am in order to get on the highway before heavy traffic (which has only gotten worse since recent RTOs - my commute is just over an hour now.) 

I don't know how else to describe what this has been like other than: miserable, torturous, not feeling like a ""person"", flooded, detached, depressed, suicidal, looming panic/anxiety, a mental toothache. When I describe it to people, they all think I'm just being a grouchy not-morning-person. But it's so much worse than that. And compounded over weeks and weeks, it's taken a massive toll and caused my depression levels to skyrocket. I'm also really worried I'm adding wear-and-tear on my body that I won't be able to repair.

When I get home from work around 4:30-5, I am absolutely exhausted. I tell my partner I'm ""not a person."" I'm a shell of a human. Back in the fall I would try to go by the gym on my way home (hit or miss, but definitely was going) - but now, about half a year into this new schedule, I am burn out and can barely get myself to drive home let alone work out. I usually fall asleep for 1-2 hours when I get home. When I wake up, I'm groggy until about 8 or 9, then I get a second wind and am up until about midnight. Then I'll get about 5-6 hours of sleep, waking up to angry alarm clock that sends me into a tailspin of dread.

Weekends, I am a shell again. I usually sleep in for as long as I can (until around 8 or 9). Even then, I can't think, make decisions, make plans, clean or run errands, enjoy any hobbies. I usually drink my coffee, eat breakfast, then fall back to sleep anywhere from 2-3 hours, then finally get my energy for the day around 2 or 3. But by that time, the day's half over.

I've considered quitting my job over this, even though I really don't want to. I've asked about going back to the later afternoon, and it is promising they will be able to make that change. But it's not set in stone just yet.

In the years when I've had a later start/end times during the day, my mental health has been much better. More energy, setting personal goals, exercising more, just generally feeling like a functioning person. I thought maybe my exhaustion was due to sleep apnea (which I have, and have used a CPAP machine for about a year now.) But that hasn't actually made me feel any better.

To those reading this - my fellow travelers on this plane of life - I am imploring for guidance. I have gone to doctors about my exhaustion and have been told the typical: exercise, diet, drink water, get into a regular sleep cycle, lifestyle changes, blah blah blah. And all of that does help, I'm sure, but I cannot stress enough just how fucking impossible these things feel when you're a zombie. Can anyone relate? Any doctors in this subreddit?

For those new to our Substack, each Sunday I deliver this message while I have my first cup of coffee of the day. I ask that you drink your coffee with me, or have some tea, or water, or pick your drink of choice while we chat. Let’s get into it.

I always like to start these Sunday messages by thanking our subscribers. You have made the MeidasTouch Network the most watched news network in America, beating Fox News. You have also officially made the MeidasTouch Substack the fastest growing channel on all of Substack. We got informed by Substack of this great honor yesterday. We would love for you to subscribe today if you aren’t yet subscribed (Remember to add the MeidasTouch Podcast on Apple Podcasts and Spotify).

Moving on…

This has been a very busy weekend. Three major things happened this weekend already.

First, Trump caved again on tariffs to China and is now giving exemptions for laptops, iPhones, and chips from his tariffs. Trump previously said there would be no exemptions. This is obviously a favor to Trump’s billionaire funders and also appears to be more market manipulation.

Second, Trump is defying the Supreme Court’s 9-0 order requiring the return of Abrego Garcia from the El Salvador gulag back to America. Trump’s DOJ refused to tell the federal district court what steps they were taking to secure the return of Garcia as they were required to do. Thereafter, Trump made a social media post saying that the migrants in the El Salvador gulag were under the “sole custody” of El Salvador’s authoritarian leader Nayib Bukele.

We are now in uncharted territory for our judicial system when the executive branch refuses to abide by a ruling. The right-wing Supreme Court enabled this hellscape with their past rulings giving Trump immunity and blocking his criminal cases from proceeding expeditiously. The MeidasTouch Network will have this story covered with every last detail.

Third, the Fighting

Oligarchy tour led by Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman AOC continues to grow. Their Saturday speech in Los Angeles drew a crowd of 36,000, and thereafter Bernie Sanders spoke to the massive crowd at Coachella. The Coachella crowd loudly booed Donald Trump. As usual, the MeidasTouch Network streamed the full Bernie Sanders / AOC event live.


By now, you know the MeidasTouch Network provides coverage of all the things the media suppresses. That’s why we’ve grown and are now the fastest growing Substack by subscribers. We cover all the protests. We cover all the shadow hearings. We cover all the Bernie rallies. We cover many of the town halls. Our coverage is relentless. I have done around 70 major interviews in the past 3 weeks—or nearly 4 interviews a day with top leaders.

Moving on…

Trump is not known for his patience. He’s lost all pretense that he’s anything other than an authoritarian madman. Things are speeding up. His authoritarian machinations have ratcheted up. At the same time, the opposition and resistance grow and accelerate.

More than ever, we need you in the fight now.

Against all odds, we are still here fighting together and we are stronger than ever. We didn’t bend or break as Trump and Musk wanted. We must work harder now than ever. We will be tested and challenged. Trump and Musk will try to destroy our spirits and joy. They are getting more desperate. Just as the cornered rat (no offense to cornered rats) is dangerous, so too is Trump and his Musk-rat.

Let’s hold the line, Meidas Mighty, and push forward.

We are armed with the power of people. We are armed now with the most viewed media network in the world, the MeidasTouch Network. We’ve got the numbers. We’ve got the message. We’ve got the distribution channels (finally!). We’ve got the momentum. We’ve got the truth. We’ve got each other.

I’m finishing up my coffee.

I am going to make a video for YouTube now.

You can’t even say normal things or make a suggestion without her getting angry.  She expects everyone to treat her right but doesn’t treat anyone else that way.  She doesn’t respond to anyone texts or calls but if you don’t respond to her she gets angry.  She doesn’t want to hear any negativity but is always negative.  She doesn’t think anything is funny that most people do.  You can only get a long with her for a few hours and then things just switch?  It’s just so strange.  

She will plan something but usually backs out or leaves early.  For example, she will rarely go to anyone’s house but if she does she says something like after dinner we can go for a walk, play games, have coffee and desert or something else enjoyable but right after dinner she will say “I think we are going to leave”.  Her and her 4 year old son.  But this predates her son.  She was like this before.  She won’t drive at night even a few minutes.  So if you want her to come to your house (which she rarely will) you have to pick her up and drive her home.  

Her and her son’s father share custody.  He is a good dad but my sister is so hard to get along with so they didn’t stay together.  My parents, husband and I aren’t allowed to have any contact with him.  Her rules. If he sends us pics of their son we are not allowed to respond.  She will only allow us to talk to him if we happen to be watching their son and he is picking him up.  She expects are parents to be available to watch him whenever she needs them to.  They usually are but that is the only time she will ever visit them anymore is to drop him off and pick him up if she needs to run errands. 

Her personality has gotten worse also.  She will tell stories but something they don’t make sense or she mumbles.  She is always saying mmm hmmm to her self.  Something she talks a mile a minute and I don’t know what she is saying.  She can barely sit still sometimes also.  And she is always saying her son’s name over and over and over again to get him to listen.  He isn’t that bad but she makes a big deal over it.  ",1,1744546238.0,personalitydisorders,1,1.0,False
