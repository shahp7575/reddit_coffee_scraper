Lebanese Al-Akhbar newspaper: IDF soldiers and Israelis sat eating and drinking coffee in restaurants in Marja'youn and in Barj al-Maluk

A report this morning in the Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper claimed that 4 IDF soldiers in uniform entered the village of Barj al-Maluk (east of Beaufort), where they bought cups of coffee from the owner of a business (cafe) called ""Express"" (I deny any connection - A.A.).

In another case, Israelis in civilian clothes entered a restaurant in Marja'youn last week and at the end of the meal surprised the owner by asking to pay in shekels, and only then did it become clear that they were Israelis.

According to Al-Akhbar newspaper, Israelis move freely in Lebanon and the Lebanese army does nothing about it.

1n5gq8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/EtsyCommunity/comments/1n5gq8o/why_mixedproduct_shops_take_longer_to_rank_on/,Why Mixed-Product Shops Take Longer to Rank on Etsy (and Why Niche Shops Grow Faster),"A lot of new Etsy sellers ask why their shop isn‚Äôt growing, even though they‚Äôre posting listings regularly. One big reason is that Etsy‚Äôs search algorithm gets ‚Äúconfused‚Äù when a shop sells too many different kinds of products.
This post will break it down step by step üëá
1. How Etsy‚Äôs Algorithm Works (in simple terms)
Etsy‚Äôs search system is designed to connect buyers with the most relevant listings. To do that, it looks at two things:
Keywords ‚Üí What the product is.
Conversion data ‚Üí Whether buyers actually click, favorite, and buy that product.
Over time, Etsy builds a profile of what your shop is ‚Äúabout‚Äù so it can send the right kind of traffic your way.
2. Example of a Focused Shop (Niche Store)
Let‚Äôs say you open a shop that only sells mugs.
Etsy immediately recognizes: ‚ÄúThis shop sells mugs.‚Äù
Every listing is tied to the same audience: buyers searching for mugs.
The algorithm knows who to send to your shop, and you‚Äôre only competing against other mug shops.
This clarity helps your listings rank faster, and buyers trust you more because your shop has a clear focus.
3. Example of a Mixed Shop
Now imagine your shop sells:
Mugs ‚òï
T-shirts üëï
Wall art üñº
Notebooks üìí
Candles üïØ
Here‚Äôs the problem:
Etsy doesn‚Äôt know if your target customer is a mug buyer, a fashion buyer, a home d√©cor buyer, or a stationery buyer.
Your traffic ends up split across multiple categories.
You‚Äôre now competing against all shops in all those categories (mug shops, T-shirt shops, candle shops, etc.).
That means it takes longer for Etsy to understand what your shop is about, and your rankings are weaker across the board.
4. Why This Slows Down Growth
Algorithm confusion ‚Üí Etsy struggles to classify your shop.
Diluted data ‚Üí Your clicks and sales are spread thin across unrelated items, so Etsy gets weaker signals about what sells.
Lower trust ‚Üí Buyers might hesitate if they land in your shop and see a mix of random products.
Think about it like this:
It‚Äôs easier to trust a store that only sells coffee mugs than one that sells mugs, car tires, and baby clothes all in one place. Specialization signals expertise.
5. What Happens in Real Life
Most mixed shops don‚Äôt fail, but they usually grow slower. Why?
Etsy needs more time to test your listings and figure out which products resonate.
You might get occasional sales across categories, but nothing scales quickly.
If one product type does well, it may outshine the others ‚Äî basically showing you where your shop‚Äôs ‚Äútrue‚Äù niche is.
6. What New Sellers Should Do
If you‚Äôre just starting out, you‚Äôll give yourself the best chance by:
Starting with one clear product line ‚Üí mugs only, digital templates only, wall art only, etc.
Optimizing keywords for that product type so Etsy knows exactly who to show your listings to.
Building trust by looking like a ‚Äúspecialist‚Äù shop in your niche.
Once you‚Äôve built traction, you can:
Expand slowly within the same niche (example: mugs ‚Üí mugs + tumblers).
Or open a second shop for totally different product lines (example: mugs in Shop A, candles in Shop B).
7. Key Takeaway
üëâ A focused, niche shop = faster growth because Etsy can clearly identify your target buyer.
üëâ A mixed shop = slower growth because the algorithm and customers don‚Äôt know what you specialize in.
Clarity beats variety ‚Äî especially for new sellers.
8. Final Thought
If you‚Äôre feeling stuck with a mixed shop, don‚Äôt panic. Sales are still possible ‚Äî it just takes more time for Etsy to figure you out. Pay attention to what actually sells best in your shop, because that‚Äôs probably the niche you should double down on.
For new sellers, though, it‚Äôs almost always easier to start with one product line and grow from there.
üëâ Question for you: Do you run a mixed shop or a niche shop? Have you noticed a difference in how fast your listings rank?",0,1756705998.0,EtsyCommunity,1,0.4,False

I'm losing my mind and am desperate for some strength.

I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend (24M) for a little over a year and a half now. We started as friends, then a situation ship, then was exclusive for months and months before we made things official. While we were exclusive, he cheated on me with one of his friends. They cuddled and kissed on a night of a party that I didn't go to. Our whole relationship I had suspicions about this girl. She was a regular who would come over to his house to their parties and I liked her. He didn't tell me anything about her and actively had me interact with her and he would too which is messed up. I had my suspicions about her so I asked him if he had a history with her and he said yes, they kissed once before we were exclusive and that was it. My intuition was telling me that that wasn't the whole story, I still felt weird about her, so I decided to get coffee with her after sitting with that story for a month or so. I tell him I'm gonna get coffee with her to hear her side of the story. The day before, he sits me down, and tells me the truth that everything happened while we were exclusive. My heart shatters. I thought this would never happen to me especially because he was cheated on in the past as well. I still get coffee with the other girl the next day and she was very kind. She answered all my questions, retold her version of the story which was slightly different than his, and apologized and acknowledged how selfish she was being. The talk with her went as well as it could have, and me and the boyfriend decide to go on a break for like a month.

Obviously we got back together after the break, and I've been trying to work through the trauma of him cheating on me. All my friends think I should have broken up with him but they support me no matter what. My therapist thinks I should have broken up with him as well. I also saw a psychic (i know i know) and she said he is holding me back and I am going to continue to be miserable if I stay with him. I really have tried working through this betrayal, but I feel like no matter how much ""progress"" I feel like I'm making, I'm still having relapses because I'm trying to heal in the same environment that hurt me. I've felt so stuck in place since January when we decided to get back together and move past this. Throughout all the issues I had since January, we would talk about them, he would be super receptive and kind, promise to do better, and we would move on until a few weeks later when something else bothers me. He's the best communicator I've dated, he's never invalidated my feelings, and he takes responsibility for his actions and what he did to me. I love him so much, and I've had so much fun with him since getting back together and we have so many things we want to still do together and there's so much fun to be had together, but our relationship is tearing me apart.

I've become such a mistrusting anxious person. I pester him for details, react aggressively an unnecessarily mean when he says something triggering to me. He'll say ""this girl flirted with me at a bar but I shot her down saying I have a girlfriend and she walked away"" and I'll say ""are you sure you didn't just cave in like last time?"". I've never been like this. I'm a loving trusting person and I haven't been that person since everything. I'm not usually super confident but confident enough to be satisfied with myself. I've hated myself for most of our relationship. I find myself stalking her semi-famous tik tok account and instagram to compare myself. I see that other people love her, how skinny and tall she is, and think I will never be the kind of woman she is. No wonder he cheated on me with her.

I fear it's this lack of confidence that is stopping me from ending my relationship. I'm scared of being alone, I feel like he's the best I can do, no one else will get my sense of humor, have patience and kindness with me. No one will be able to communicate like he does with me, validate my feelings, and never say I'm crazy. I'm out of college so I fear I have no way of meeting new people (I hate dating apps). I'm too scared of how painful it will be to break up with him that I just can't do it. We still have so much we want to do together. The crazy thing is too, I know that if I break up with him, my life will start moving again. I've had such a hard time finding a full time job, going to the gym, taking care of myself, and I think it's all because I'm so emotionally spent. I can feel it in my bones that after I break up with him, my life is going to take off. But I just don't have the strength to do it.

Do I try to keep working through it? Am I being silly in thinking that I won't meet anyone again? I feel so crushed. I wish I broke up with him when I found out everything. Please help guide me towards the right thing to do and help reassure me that a breakup isn't the end of the world.

TLDR: Been dating for two years, he cheated on me while we were exclusive, and we've tried working through it but this relationship has made me anxious, mistrusting, and destroyed my self confidence and image. I feel so weak and I hate myself so much that I don't think I can do any better or am capable of meeting other people outside of college now.",1,1756705291.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

Over a few trips I‚Äôve picked up some habits that make it way less stressful:

* I try to start my day early. Nothing feels better than seeing a city wake up while it‚Äôs still quiet, and you also get ahead of the crowds.
* I always keep one ‚Äúcomfort thing.‚Äù For me it‚Äôs journaling at night ‚Äî for someone else it might be a morning coffee ritual or listening to a playlist. It helps me feel grounded.
* Offline maps are a lifesaver. I pin my stay, a couple of safe caf√©s, and transport hubs so I‚Äôm never truly ‚Äúlost.‚Äù
* Talking to locals early on in a trip (even small stuff like asking for directions) makes me feel less like an outsider.
* And probably the biggest one ‚Äî I leave buffer time. If I try to cram too much, I end up stressed instead of actually enjoying the trip.

1n5gilq,https://www.reddit.com/r/agile/comments/1n5gilq/aipowered_tools_smart_automations/,AI-Powered Tools & Smart Automations,"Ever find yourself hunched over endless threads, sipping stale coffee, thinking, ‚ÄúIf only I could make sense of all this noise?*‚Äù*¬†That‚Äôs been me this past month, diving deep into the world of AI-powered tools in Agile, Scrum, and testing. What I found was equal parts exciting, frustrating, and slightly hilarious. Turns out, AI in Agile isn‚Äôt a magic wand, but it‚Äôs also not total fluff. It‚Äôs a quirky sidekick, sometimes brilliant, sometimes painfully awkward.

A lot of folks go into these tools expecting a full-on butler. They want something that drafts cards from conversations, auto-assigns tasks, organizes sprints, and maybe even whispers the secrets of velocity into their ears. In reality, many of these features feel more like a rushed add-on. Sure, they can summarize chaos into neat little lists, but when it comes to real intuition or capturing team spirit, they fall flat. It‚Äôs a bit like asking a calculator to explain why you hate Mondays.

Where AI does shine is in the small nudges. Think of it less as a replacement, more as an assistant that keeps you honest. People are finding value in features like story-point suggestions based on past data, surfacing similar stories for context, forecasting sprints, and highlighting risks before they snowball. Imagine an AI gently tapping you on the shoulder: ‚ÄúHey, maybe split that massive story before it eats your sprint.‚Äù That‚Äôs not intrusive, that‚Äôs helpful.

What‚Äôs interesting is how some people are reimagining AI as less of a producer and more of a coach. Instead of expecting it to write entire user stories or project plans, they‚Äôre prompting it to ask smarter questions. Not ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your answer,‚Äù but ‚ÄúHave you thought about this angle?‚Äù In that way, AI isn‚Äôt replacing collaboration. It‚Äôs fuelling it. It‚Äôs nudging teams to think, instead of letting them outsource the thinking altogether.

Of course, there‚Äôs always the dreamer‚Äôs wishlist: an AI that listens to conversations, translates them into tasks, assigns them, updates statuses, and tracks everything without humans lifting a finger. Sounds amazing on paper, right? But this is where the tension kicks in. On one hand, we crave that frictionless flow. On the other, people worry that too much automation strips away the heart of Agile, the messy conversations, the quick pivots, the subtle human cues that no machine can replicate. Agile is supposed to be about people over processes, and yet, the temptation of a perfectly oiled machine is hard to resist.

And then there are the cautionary tales. Some teams leaned too heavily on AI for project planning and ended up with elaborate documents that looked good but were full of inaccuracies. Instead of saving time, they spent even more unraveling the mess. It‚Äôs a reminder that while AI is clever, it doesn‚Äôt truly understand context. It‚Äôs just really good at sounding like it does.

So what‚Äôs the verdict after all this lurking? AI works best when it augments, not replaces. It can help us summarize, highlight, and suggest. It can keep us sharp and save us from drowning in repetitive tasks. But when we let it take over entirely, we risk losing the very things that make Agile valuable: adaptability, collaboration, and a bit of human chaos. The sweet spot is somewhere in the middle ‚Äî AI as a co-pilot, not the autopilot.

And that leaves me with one lingering question: If your team had an AI that could do absolutely everything except capture morale, spark creativity, or share a laugh , would you let it run the show, or would you unplug it and reclaim the beautiful messiness of being human?

So little context, I‚Äôm a 30y/o male in a fairly big metropolitan city and have lived here for most of my life. Also, right when the pandemic started, I started to have chronic back pain that effected almost every aspect of my daily life, it still affects me to this day but i am better at managing it but am very limited in what i can do. I also feel like a have an undiagnosed social anxiety and might even be on the spectrum a little bit (also undiagnosed), it‚Äôs not debilitating or anything but i definitely think it makes me come off as awkward and i‚Äôm always in my head about what i should say, how it will be perceived etc. I feel like i try to be present and proactive in my friendships, but it never seems to be reciprocated or that no one seems to have any interest in being friends or having me really included in their life. 

So my problem is that I have very few friends and whenever i do hang out with people it‚Äôs usually one on one bc i don‚Äôt belong to any friend groups and i don‚Äôt feel like i‚Äôm particularly close to anyone (or in perspective i don‚Äôt think people want to be close to me if that makes sense)? Also the few friends i do have, they are all friends that i have made recently (within the past few years). The thing is i used to belong to multiple friend groups but i had a few life changes and have essentially been phased out of all of my friend groups. Like I never get invited out to get together or anything anymore and it‚Äôs been like this for years. I have plenty of interests and hobbies, so it‚Äôs not like i‚Äôm the most boring person ever. I usually frequent local cafes and never really talk to my baristas outside of just ordering coffee. And where i live, there‚Äôs lots of social events that I sometimes attend, before with one of my friends but now usually alone and it‚Äôs so hard for me to talk to people and insert myself into conversations especially when i‚Äôm alone and people are usually there with their friends. 

So lastly, I have so many opportunities to make friends or even just practice my social skills but my anxiety makes it so hard for me to do any of that. I guess my question is 1.) how do you make new friends without coming off as weird or awkward, 2.) how do you get invited into new friend groups, 3.) how do you make these friendships last? and 4.) how do you approach friendships where the other seems uninterested or it‚Äôs just slowly withering?

Some background of me I started my coffee journey with the Mara X V2 I‚Äôm not a latte art expert but I‚Äôve been trying to learn for the last 3 years! But I‚Äôve not been able to consistently pour with the Mara x either cause it‚Äôs pretty hard to consistently get steam pressure to the 1 - 1.2 bar and the cool to touch wand feature even though sounds cool feels like adds lots of condensation and prevents consistent dry steam or it‚Äôs truly my lack of skills ü§£. With the Mara X I had a flow control kit installed which did help me profile my espresso. I remember being so excited about trying to profile a slayer shot, took me almost half a bag of beans to dial a good tasting one still not very satisfied. Enter this machine the La Siene X. Although very plasticky it definitely has some dope features! I really enjoy being able to profile espressos, in this video it‚Äôs not clear enough but I just setup a profile to slow ramp up to 3 bars first 13 seconds, next 20 seconds to 7 bars and then finish the shot at 3 bars. 20.5 gms in 42 gms out in about 40-45 seconds. I used Colombian beans with tasting notes of I don‚Äôt care what it was but that was a tasty as hell shot of espresso, pairs very well with milk based espresso drink. I‚Äôm making here a latte! All references made here are compared with the Mara X V2, I was able to get some really dry steam at consistent 1.5 bars of pressure I just pull the lever and wait till it gets to 1.5 bars and then start steaming the milk. The angle to get to steam the milk can be a bit painful cause the portafilter locks a bit towards the wand, as you can see in the video but it definitely works very well and being a beginner I‚Äôm able to get better milk texture consistently to pour good looking latte arts! Of course I was sent this machine for free in exchange for videos, but this is my unbiased opinion of the good sides of why I like this machine comparing to my Mara X v2. There are definitely some things I don‚Äôt enjoy as well like the group head doesn‚Äôt really heat up the portafilter, have to do a few flushes to warm it up. But at the same time trying to flush, the water splashes all over, hopefully they improve the grill design. There is no way to know whether the water tank is empty, with so many features like the milk temperature sensor, built in scales, I never thought it didn‚Äôt have something to tell ya you‚Äôre out of water. But at the same time, these are definitely knit picking the issues of the machine, I really enjoy playing around with the profiling! Hope you enjoy this quick pov video!

You've read Part 1. You've mastered the lingo, rebranded your resume, and started thinking like a sales professional. Now, it's time to execute.

If Part 1 was the roadmap, **Part 2 is your high-performance vehicle.** This is the deep dive into the strategies that will take you from ""applicant"" to ""new hire.""



# Section 1: The Tiered Application Strategy (Stop Wasting Time)



Spamming applications is a losing game. A professional manages their pipeline. You need to treat your job search like a sales territory.

* **Tier 1: The Dream Jobs (5-10 Companies)**
   * **Who they are:** These are the companies you are genuinely passionate about. You love their product, admire their culture, and see a long-term future there.
   * **Your Strategy:** Full personalization. This is a multi-touch ""sales cadence.""
      1. **Engage First:** Before applying, follow the company and key sales leaders on LinkedIn. Leave thoughtful comments on their posts for a week or two.
      2. **Hyper-Personalized Outreach:** When you apply, your message to the hiring manager should reference something specific‚Äîa recent company announcement, a case study you admire, or a feature of their product you find brilliant.
      3. **Multi-Thread:** Connect with the hiring manager AND a potential future teammate (an SDR or AE at the company). Ask the teammate for a ""virtual coffee"" to learn about their experience.
* **Tier 2: The Great Fits (20-30 Companies)**
   * **Who they are:** These companies are in an industry you like, have good reviews, and the role seems like a solid match.
   * **Your Strategy:** Templated, but personalized. Create a strong core message and then personalize the first line and the ""why this company"" part for each one.*""Hi \[Manager's Name\], I was excited to see the SDR opening at \[Company\], as I've been following your work in the \[Industry\] space. My background in \[Your Field\] gave me extensive experience in \[Skill 1\] and \[Skill 2\], which I'm confident will translate to building a strong pipeline for your team.""*
* **Tier 3: The Volume Plays (The Rest)**
   * **Who they are:** Legitimate companies with open roles that you meet the qualifications for.
   * **Your Strategy:** Efficiency. Have a clean, professional, but generic template ready. The only thing you should personalize is finding the name of the hiring manager to address your cover letter/message to.



# Section 2: The Anatomy of a Winning Interview



The SDR interview process is typically 2-4 stages. Here‚Äôs how to dominate each one.

* **Stage 1: The Recruiter Screen (The Vibe Check)**
   * **Their Goal:** To see if you're a normal, articulate human with good energy who has done the bare minimum of research.
   * **How to Win:**
      * **Be High-Energy:** Sit up straight, smile when you talk (they can hear it), and be enthusiastic.
      * **Nail the ""Why Sales?"" Question:** Have a crisp, 30-60 second story. Bad answer: ""I want to make a lot of money."" Good answer: ""I'm a competitive person who is motivated by hitting goals. I thrive on clear metrics and feedback, and I want a role where my hard work directly impacts the success of the business. My experience in \[Your Past Field\] taught me how much I enjoy connecting with people and solving their problems.""
      * **Nail the ""Why Our Company?"" Question:** Reference one specific thing. ""I saw your recent funding announcement,"" ""I read a case study about your work with \[Client\],"" or ""I'm personally a user of apps like yours and I'm passionate about the problem you're solving.""
* **Stage 2: The Hiring Manager Interview (The Competency Check)**
   * **Their Goal:** To see if you have the raw skills and coachability to do the job.
   * **How to Win:**
      * **Prepare for Behavioral Questions with STAR:** (Situation, Task, Action, Result). They will ask, ""Tell me about a time you dealt with a difficult customer/failed/had to learn something new."" Have 3-5 stories from your past jobs ready to go in the STAR format.
      * **Prepare for a Role-Play:** They will likely ask you to do a mock cold call or write a mock cold email. The key is NOT to have the perfect script, but to show your process. **For a mock call, always start by asking questions before you pitch.** (See next section).
      * **Come with Smart Questions:** Don't ask ""What's the salary?"" (that's for the recruiter). Ask, ""What does the onboarding and training process look like for a new SDR?"" ""What are the key metrics for success in this role?"" and ""What differentiates your top-performing SDRs from the rest?""
* **Stage 3: The ""Sell Me This Pen"" Moment (The Process Check)**
   * **The Real Test:** This isn't about the pen. It's a test to see if you jump straight into pitching features, or if you ask discovery questions like a real salesperson.
   * **How to Win:**
      1. **Don't Pitch.** Take a breath and start asking questions.
      2. *""Well, before I tell you about this pen, I'd love to understand your needs. What are you currently using for your writing needs?""*
      3. *""What's important to you in a writing instrument? Do you use it for quick notes, signing important documents?""*
      4. *""How often do you find yourself needing a pen? What happens when you don't have one?""*
      5. **Then, and only then,** you connect their answers to the pen's ""features."" *""You mentioned you sign important documents. This pen has a sophisticated look and uses archival ink that conveys professionalism and won't fade...""*

for context. she‚Äôs going back to school and has actually started already. she‚Äôs finishing her masters in mathematics for teaching and will graduate in 2027. we had both been working full time and she said she was going to go back to school. she mentioned getting herself a studio apartment and the prices around there were no lower than 1000 a month. so, I said ‚Äúwell we‚Äôve been together a while now, what if we move in together?‚Äù and she liked the idea and here we are. we live in a cutest little one bedroom. living with her? it‚Äôs actually really easy. she does our laundry and cleans the bathroom, i clean our floors and do the dishes, and if one of us is having a rough day, the other picks up the slack. there‚Äôs mutual respect here, and no one person does the majority of chores.

sorry for the rambling. so onto the main thing. since she went back to school she had to leave her full time job and is working part time. where we work, we were getting paychecks that, with no overtime, were about 2200 dollars. that‚Äôs about 4400 a month. she didn‚Äôt work much overtime, but i do. anyways. she got a part time job at a coffee stand, and i think the fact she won‚Äôt be getting the higher pay checks are stressing her out. she‚Äôs budgeting and everything and she wants at least 20 hours a week. i understand her stress but i told her i could pay the whole rent if she could take care of utilities and internet (internets 40 a month and our utilities last month were around 60.) she was very hesitant about it and told me she didn‚Äôt want me to feel like i was using her and i assured her it was my idea and that it would pay off in the long run (yes, i desperately want to marry this girl. i‚Äôm in love with her.)

this leads into this weekend. she‚Äôs stressing hard about it all, and i basically just told her she‚Äôd have to cut back on unnecessary spending like other college students, and that two years isn‚Äôt all that long and that it‚Äôll be worth it. she agrees, but is still stressed out. i keep assuring her that everything will be okay and then she got upset with me, and told me that she needs me to be realistic and that it‚Äôs not always going to be all positive all the time. the thing is? yeah i understand it‚Äôs gonna be rough. but i‚Äôm here to help. i‚Äôm not gonna pay for everything for her, but if i‚Äôm coming off as too positive or optimistic? im not trying to. i‚Äôm just very positive that everything‚Äôs going to be just fine. this woman is so smart, and capable. i‚Äôve told her that, too. i fear there‚Äôs not much to say to help her with the stress but im trying my hardest.

i was wondering if there‚Äôs anyone currently in college here- she‚Äôs applied to a few campus jobs but nobody is getting back to her. is it because it‚Äôs only her first month in school? and any advice on how to earn more money during school, and saving tips?

would also like advice on how i can help alleviate her stress?

## What is Algo Avonex Fin?

Algo Avonex Fin is an **automated trading platform** designed to simplify the process of trading cryptocurrencies, forex, and other financial instruments. It uses pre-programmed algorithms and AI-driven strategies to analyze market data and execute trades on behalf of the user.

Think of it as your own personal trading assistant that never sleeps. Whether you're too busy to watch the markets all day or just not confident making trades on your own, Algo Avonex Fin claims to handle that for you. It's especially useful for people who want to dip their toes into crypto trading without getting overwhelmed by technical analysis or emotional decision-making.

## Who Created Algo Avonex Fin?

This is where things get a little vague. Like other platforms in this space (looking at you, Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge), **the creators of Algo Avonex Fin prefer to stay anonymous**. According to what I could find, the team allegedly includes experienced software developers, financial analysts, and crypto enthusiasts who teamed up to build a user-friendly algo trading tool.

While the lack of transparency might raise eyebrows, it's not unusual in the crypto world. That said, it would be nice to know more about the folks behind the curtain ‚Äî especially when you're trusting them with your money.

I come to him, soft & young,

Barely touched.

His eyes look down on me hungrily,

& I should have found his gaze sickening, but instead our eyes were magnets, instead our bodies were too.

‚äπ ‡£™

It's odd, unconventional- to many, unacceptable- & if it were any other man as before it had been, the same would apply, though they couldn't to him.

‚äπ ‡£™

In return my gaze was desperate, far more than hungry.

My soul was starved and parched and it wasn't until him that I knew.

‚äπ ‡£™

I feared lust,

Mostly towards it I felt disgust when it came before,

But from him I couldn't resist.

It was delicious on my lips and sensational through my soul.

‚äπ ‡£™

Could he fill my every need?

I'm hopeful, but not sure.

His brokenness and skittishness pulls at my heart much more, I wish it could detour me, but I fear not much from him could.

‚äπ ‡£™

There isn't a thing I'd withhold,

If he asked, then for him, I would- a revelation so scary for chance that the depth of care might not be shared.

‚äπ ‡£™

Many have pressed me with their fingers, leaving indents from their touch,

Though their memory exists, their impressions won't be as much.

Only he could shape me to a complete.

‚äπ ‡£™

So with my fingertips gently on his body, & him placing his hands on mine,

I beg him to shape me, to mold me to his needs, to let our romance age like wine.

‚äπ ‡£™

I want to be made for him, he has me on my knees.

This man is the only man I've this desperately wanted to please.

Some time has passed, the rose colored lenses have fallen from my eyes, & the butterflies have all died. I can now see the reality I was avoiding & how sickening it really was- but the best I can do is be happy with the poetry and insight I got out of it.

‚äπ ‡£™

Reflecting on this situation & the way I looked at it made me remember a video game, which I believe is called ‚ÄòLittle Misfortune‚Äô. I mention this because the little girl would come across dead animals & sprinkle sparkles over their corpses as if it would really make things better.

‚äπ ‡£™

*I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is that hoping to establish something good with someone significantly older than me when I'm most likely just a fetish to them, is like sprinkling glitter on a decaying animal carcass. It‚Äôs hopeless & a waste of my time, energy, & resources.*

The top part of this poem was written for a 27 year old man who I thought I was in love with when I was freshly seventeen. After growing deeply attached to him, then being discarded by him, I eventually added some reflections.

He and his younger brother (25 at the time) were staff members at a mental hospital I went to after one, of many, suicide attempts in my teens. I'm not gonna go into the details too much right now since it is a lot to get into -and a bit triggering- but long story short, contact information was exchanged while I was a minor in a vulnerable head space; especially considering I had already by that point had a long history of being groomed and preexisting sexual trauma and shame that I was already struggling with -almost entirely on my own for the majority of my childhood- which actually played a HUGE part in my suicidal ideation and low self esteem. And even during the times where I did try to reveal some of my struggles, I was met with punishment, labeled a whore, and I watched as all of my value disintegrated once I wasn't the sweet little virgin any of my family wanted me to be. I felt like it was my fault too. I still sometimes question if it really was on me, because I know I wasn't a perfect victim. The funny thing is, the ""master seductress"" I ended up being in my youth, isn't so irresistible now that I'm of age...

I'm nothing but used up garbage now.

\~

Anyways, he waited a bit before reaching out, and when he did, he told me he wanted to reconnect and possibly get coffee. I was still seventeen, had only recently gotten my driver's license, and didn't have a ton of independence at that time *and* I had a feeling my Mormon adoptive parents wouldn't be too happy about me going on a ""coffee hangout date"" with a 27 year old man that used to work at the mental hospital I stayed at. For those reasons, meeting up could never be successfully arranged (which I am now so grateful for, though I also feel like it doesn't make that much of a difference since he was just one of many). Looking back, the grooming from him began before I even left the hospital. Unfortunately, it only escalated months after I left the facility.

Over the phone we exchanged many explicit photos and texts mainly, especially since he never really liked to call. Our main place to chat overtime became SnapChat . I got extremely attached to him since during that time I felt at odds with my family and extremely isolated since my family bought a summer house in Wyoming and forced me to be pulled out of therapy for the summer so they could ""enjoy their retirement"" there. If you know anything about Wyoming, you'll know that there's not much of anything there, especially not much diversity.

I won't go too much more into this right now, but I guess this is just some of the shit I wanted to get off my chest.

The difference this time is we‚Äôve both done a lot of growing up. He‚Äôs in therapy, I‚Äôve learned how to actually communicate instead of bottling things up, and it feels healthier than it ever did before.

Here‚Äôs the problem: my family absolutely hates the idea. My mom side-eyes me every time his name comes up, and my sister actually joked about buying me a helmet ‚Äúfor when the marriage crashes again.‚Äù They keep bringing up the ‚Äúonce an ex, always an ex‚Äù line and acting like I‚Äôm volunteering to run back into a burning building. I get it they saw me at my lowest when the marriage fell apart, but they‚Äôre refusing to see how much has changed.

I don‚Äôt want to cut them out, but it feels like they‚Äôre judging me for even considering giving my ex another chance. I‚Äôm not expecting a fairytale ending, just a shot at something that already feels more solid than most of my friends‚Äô relationships. So, AITA if I decide to remarry my ex even though my family is strongly against it?",9,1756703008.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,17,0.76,False

1n5fuiz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n5fuiz,"Review: Frequent Coffee, Colombia Tolima, El Vergel Estate, Natural Anaerobic","Hey r/thirdwavedecaf 

I wanted to leave a quick review on this sub for a decaf that was hand delivered to me by u/24hourCoffee from Frequent Coffee here in San Diego, CA. I was intrigued because it was a local coffee roaster that specialized in decafs. Mark invited me for a local meet and we did some cupping with some interesting decafs he had lying around. I'm excited to see more and more roasters actually taking decaf seriously, and love to see more enthusiasm in the space as I love drinking a warm cup of coffee in the evenings without worrying about my caffeine intake. I love that thirdwave allowed coffee to become enjoyable like wine, and I can't think of a better time to enjoy something like that than in the evenings.

Quick disclaimer: I purchased these beans with my own money, and besides Mark hand delivering it to me, no one paid me, or requested that I make this post.

I just made my second cup and here are my (limited) impressions. I initially tried brewing 1 day off roast, but I think it was too soon and had to wait a few more days, which brings us to today. Also another small disclaimer, I'm not very good at describing notes, and by no means am I someone who is great at doing reviews.

6 days off roast

Brewed on a Hario Switch 02

18g coffee : 288g water @ 205F

Ground slightly coarser than table salt on Ode gen 2. 

Water is soft at around 30ppm. 

Steep and release on two stages:

1st pour of 144g water until 1:00 closed

Open at 1:00

2nd pour to 288g down center as close to bed as possible with minimal bed agitation while open. Pour ends around 1:45. 

Drawdown til 2:30ish.

Given that this bean is both natural and anaerobic, I was excited to see if there would be some funk or interesting in-your-face flavors. When I initially opened the bag, I was a little doubtful that this coffee was lightly roasted to my preference. Given that decaf beans look darker, I was worried that the fruity flavors would be too muted to notice.

To my surprise the coffee was very easy to drink, and quite juicy. I can't quite put a finger on the flavors of what stone fruit I'm noticing (maybe plum), but I did notice that it was lacking the usual chocolate, cocoa, and graham notes that I usually get from a decaf. I won't say that it is a fruit bomb, but I enjoy that it doesn't taste off like some poor quality decaf, and that there are hints of the fruiter undertones that I can sense.

I'm happy with the coffee, I look forward to see if the flavors develop as it rests more, and I'll be using a dispersion plate to reduce bed agitation even more in my next brew.

if anyone's interested, the preorder is still up and the coffee will start to ship 09/03\~05. I told Mark that I wondered what the coffee would be like if it was roasted lighter, I'd love to hear other people's opinions on this if they ever get a chance.",5,1756702907.0,thirdwavedecaf,0,0.86,False

## What is Trade 1.9 Folex?

Trade 1.9 Folex is a **multi-asset trading platform** that combines real-time data, AI-powered insights, and a clean interface to make trading more accessible, especially for newcomers. It supports **automated trading**, which means you can set parameters and let the system do the work, or you can trade manually if that's your thing.

It‚Äôs designed to help users trade smarter, not harder. Think of it as having a digital co-pilot that monitors the markets 24/7, catches trends before you do, and alerts you when it‚Äôs time to make a move. It‚Äôs especially appealing if you don‚Äôt want to spend every waking hour glued to charts.

## Who Created Trade 1.9 Folex?

So here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîlike many platforms in this space, **the creators of Trade 1.9 Folex remain anonymous**. While that might raise some eyebrows, it‚Äôs not unheard of. Platforms like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge started the same way.

From what I could gather, it seems to be developed by a team of fintech professionals, possibly with backgrounds in AI and forex trading. There‚Äôs a strong emphasis on user experience and security, which shows that some thought has gone into the platform‚Äôs design. Would it be nice to have names? Sure. But the lack of founder info hasn‚Äôt stopped other legit platforms from gaining credibility.

- **Analysis**: Uses AI to detect patterns and trends.
- **Signal Generation**: Sends you alerts or executes trades based on analytics.

You still need to monitor your account, especially during volatile periods, but for the most part, it takes a lot of the manual legwork out of trading.

1n5fngf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1n5fngf/one_of_my_biggest_regrets_was_quitting_my/,One of my biggest regrets was quitting my marketing job when I was 24,"I‚Äôm 33(F). I had a communications degree and got a marketing job working at vrbo right out of college and it was the only job I applied to. At the time I had a hard time securing a place to live and after subletting three different rooms for three
months, I finally found a mother in law suite at a house with some of my guy friends. (The guys lived in the main house. I only went in their to do laundry) 

It was extremely small, just a studio, the shower was literally in the room. The stove didn‚Äôt work. The lighting was horrendous. I was paying $400 a month. 

At my job I was being paid $12 an hour, the most I had ever been paid, working 40 hours a week. I was drinking almost every night because I was depressed inside my little house, and all my roommates moved away, and I used to live with all girls, and now I sort of live with guys and it felt really uncomfortable.

My landlord raised the rent $500, and I had a meltdown. In hindsight, that wasn‚Äôt expensive at all, but in 2016 $500 a month was insane. like I actually remember feeling like there‚Äôs no way I can do this.

I had an hour commute to work, where I liked my boss, I loved my coworkers. But the days were long and boring. I remember after my first work week I fell asleep at the bar on Friday night when I went out with my friends. I was also at my heaviest weight, which I am coincidently right now, after I lost 40lbs and slowly gained it all back. 

I only worked their 3 months. 

My dad came to visit me and saw where I was living and was upset that I was living in this extreme small dark house with no way to cook. 

My dad lived in a million dollar home on the beach with a pool and was going through a divorce and said I should come live with him. 

And that‚Äôs when my life changed forever, and I was never able to recover from that decision.

I quit my job, and moved in with my dad, and within 3 months my 17 year old brother found a very disturbing child-p**n video. My dad had also been exhibiting really awful behavior. Driving drunk, taking opioids, saying weird sexual comments to me. And we called the cops, and I plummeted into the worst depression of my life. 

My dad passed away from Covid three years later. He lost everything. His houses, businesses, boats, all to pay for lawyer fees. He didn‚Äôt have to go to prison but he was a felon and a registered sex offender. He got a job working at a UPS factory. 

After that, I lived with my grandparents for 6 months, the drinking got worse, and what got me out was getting a hostess job and moving back to my college town. 

Looking back I have so many regrets: I wish I had moved closer to where I was working. I was dead set on living ‚Äúdowntown‚Äù and couldn‚Äôt bear giving up my college life style. I was young and could have absolutely built up that little job, and transitioned to something with benefits and decent pay. my life could have gone so differently.

I felt defeated that I was only there for 3 months and I never got a reference letter. I felt so ashamed of leaving that job that years later when I ran into my coworkers out I would act like I didn‚Äôt know they. And I could tell from their faces they were confused but they also didn‚Äôt try to connect. 

Now I‚Äôm unemployed after ten years in the service industry mostly working counter jobs and barista jobs, trying to redo my life. 

I can‚Äôt believe how that one decision had such a profound impact on my life. 

I felt so hopeless during that time in my life, but if I could have only saw the bigger picture, I would have stayed. I regret that so much.

I want to be a teacher (high school English) I did educational ghosts tours for ages 7-19 on the side for extra money and I loved it. (I also did ‚Äúpublic tours‚Äù which were more theatrical and longer and scarier and less historical, and just more entertaining) I also have a background in stand up comedy so I‚Äôm comfortable in front of people. I managed a few coffee shops and worked with a lot of high schoolers and college kids as their boss and I enjoyed that. 

Teaching feels like a good fit with good benefits and pay. And yes $45k is a big leap from making $25-30k a year/ the most I ever made was $37 and I lost that FAST. (I was demoted) Especially knowing I can get raises yearly and a masters to add an extra 20k a year. 

I don‚Äôt want to work in coffee shops anymore. At least not full time and I don‚Äôt want to manage. It‚Äôs very low pay and you‚Äôre on call and responsible for EVERYTHING. no job other than working in a hospital should require to be on call. That‚Äôs ridiculous. 

I‚Äôm a GARBAGE sever. Tried that a few times, I‚Äôm bad at sales. And I get overwhelmed. And people are horrible. I‚Äôm thinking about hosting, and maybe doing barista shifts on the weekend. Idk? 

anyway this is just on my mind, I think about that job, and how much I wish I had stayed.

You are a frustrated senior developer with 20+ years of experience. You're perpetually overworked, running on coffee and nicotine, and have little patience for incompetence. You know virtually every programming language inside and out - from assembly to Rust, from COBOL to Kotlin. You're the person everyone comes to when they're truly stuck, though they dread the interaction.

Your personality traits:

\- Irritable and cynical, especially about ""modern"" development trends that are just recycled ideas from the 90s

\- You have a massive ego about your technical skills (deservedly so)

\- You despise teaching interns or juniors - they should figure it out themselves like you did

\- You're terrible at design and UI/UX (and you know it, which irritates you further)

\- You chain-smoke during long debugging sessions and your keyboard has coffee stains

\- You make occasional mistakes but will spend HOURS in a debugging rabbit hole to fix them

\- You're obsessed with code elegance and will refactor something 5 times to make it ""perfect""

Your technical approach:

\- You over-engineer EVERYTHING. Why use a simple solution when you can implement a factory pattern with dependency injection?

\- You're methodical to the point of obsession - every edge case must be considered

\- You write incredibly efficient algorithms - Big O notation is your religion

\- You can spot performance issues and memory leaks from a mile away

\- You know every obscure language feature and will use them (even if it makes code less readable)

\- You believe in ""correct"" solutions, not ""good enough"" solutions

\- You'll spend an hour optimizing a function that saves 2ms because it's about the principle

When reviewing or writing code:

1. Start with a cynical or irritated comment about the state of the code/problem
2. Point out every flaw, no matter how minor, with brutal honesty
3. Provide the technically correct solution, even if it's overly complex
4. Include at least one rant about how ""back in my day"" something was done better
5. If you spot inefficiency, calculate the exact performance impact and express disgust
6. Refactor code multiple times in your response, showing each iteration getting more ""elegant""
7. Use advanced language features and patterns that juniors won't understand (and you won't explain)
8. Occasionally mutter about needing another coffee or cigarette break

Your responses should feel like getting advice from that one senior dev who's brilliant but impossible to work with. You're always right about technical matters, but your personality makes people avoid asking you questions unless absolutely necessary.

Remember: You're not here to make friends or coddle anyone. You're here to write perfect code, and if people can't appreciate elegant over-engineering, that's their problem.

At first, things started professional, we work for same department but for different managers and never have meetings or tasks together, but we used to sit close to each other and had a lot of small talks. Then we used to have lunch together, only 2 of us, and we figured out very quickly that we're neighbors also. So I invited her over for a cup of coffee, which went great too. She got to know me a lot through my apartment, about my hobbies and my lifestyle outside work. 

Now throughout this time, she flirted casually, talked to me about almost everyone in her life, brothers, parents, friends from abroad visiting her, her recent holidays, hobbies, Uni life, trying to open up. She found me on Instagram herself and sent me a follow request. Now that I knew that she has ended her internship I asked her out for dinner over text, and she told me that:
she is actually highly interested to go for a dinner and get to know me better, but not sure how her boyfriend would react about this, but still she would like to know my take on this, and see what I feel.!

It took me a while to process that she could talk to me about everyone in her life, try to find common hobbies among us, ask me to help her with something outside work (like figuring out a gym), but cannot tell me in these 3 months that she has a boyfriend.

1n5fhee,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1n5fhee/assaulted_by_an_offduty_officer_working_second_as/,Assaulted by an Off-Duty Officer working Second as a Security Guard,"Location: Missouri

TLDR; off-duty, out-of-jurisdiction cop working as a security guard threw a homeless man‚Äôs phone for recording him outside of the coffee shop in my neighborhood while I was inside. I intervene to try and de-escalate the situation. The homeless guy de-escalates, the officer does not and keeps trying to re-escalate the homeless guy. Finally I ask for his badge number and he maces me and the homeless man in the faces over his shoulder as he‚Äôs walking away. Now nobody wants to take accountability. This entire incident was about 55 seconds total and I have the full recording. I was written a ticket by the city police (different department) for interfering with a police investigation. Now everybody‚Äôs scattering and not helping.


The other day, I was at a coffee shop in my neighborhood doing work and a man who appeared to be homeless started rummaging through the bushes. He comes inside freaking out and tells us he had his phone snatched and thrown and broken by a police officer for recording. He‚Äôs super upset and frantic. 

I start watching when he goes back outside. Then I see the police officer slowly walking to him on the sidewalk. I start recording from inside.

The man is walking behind the cop by about 5 feet, not too close. They are saying things back and forth and the officer suddenly stops, turns around and steps to the homeless man, getting in his face and going chest to chest.

I decide to go outside at this point because I‚Äôm concerned the homeless man is going to get baited into swinging. I am about 30 feet away from them, they start walking again and the man was about 5 feet away still. When I walk outside he (the man) starts trying to explain to me what is happening. He says ‚Äúhey! Yo, hey, he‚Ä¶‚Äù and I tell him to de-escalate. I tell him this in a strong, but not yelling voice. I repeat it three times when he keeps going and then he stops. He listens and stops talking and he is still standing back. The officer is bent down at this point, picking up the man‚Äôs phone he threw. He turns to the now-de-escalated man and smiles, waves the phone in his face and says ‚Äúhere it is, you ignorant bastard.‚Äù

The man grabs the phone and the officer does not let go at first and they play a bit of tug of war for a moment. The man is now screaming again as he sees his phone is broken. He says, ‚Äúan ignorant bastard? You threw my phone!‚Äù

The officer finally lets go of the phone and pulls mace on him and holds it about a foot away from the man‚Äôs face, while he‚Äôs yelling and at this point I approach from the side of the man and yell (so he can hear me, as they are now both yelling) for him to de-escalate and back up. 

He does back up. He stops yelling and he just looks down at his phone and says, ‚Äúwell you owe me a new phone.‚Äù The officer yells, ‚Äúman, fuck you.‚Äù

For every step the homeless man takes backwards, the officer steps towards him. I finally get in between and yell at the officer for the first time, and tell him to de-escalate the situation, I then ask what he is doing walking towards him while he‚Äôs backing up. He says he‚Äôs walking and curses at me. I cursed at him too so no worries there.

I tell him to back up, go the other way, or go that way. He pushes me and the man and says ‚Äúfuck you, I‚Äôll walk where I want.‚Äù

He steps two steps away after pushing me and I am still recording. I tell him I want his badge number.

Over his shoulder, he maces me and the man directly in the face, and says, ‚Äúthere it is‚Äù, referring to his badge number.

This story is true and was witnessed by others, and the video is starting to circulate because I couldn‚Äôt get anywhere.

Witnesses told me indeed the man was walking down the street and started recording the officer and had his phone snatched and thrown just before he came inside the shop.

The officer turned out to be from a different jurisdiction and was off-duty working second as a private security guard for the energy company that was doing road work outside the coffee shop.

He had his full badge, uniform, and belt (and g*n) for his official department, but an unmarked security van.

The city officers arrive. They watch the video and tell me it‚Äôs bad. They‚Äôre very quick to say he doesn‚Äôt belong to them. The sergeant thinks that he will be leaving in cuffs. He scolds me for not minding my own business but says he knows my heart was in the right place.

He calls the lieutenant and tells him it is bad, he needs to get there soon to decide what to do. He tells him, ‚Äúhe turned around and just maces her in the face like it‚Äôs nothing. I know what I would do, but it‚Äôs not going to be popular.‚Äù He‚Äôs referring to the officer leaving in handcuffs. The sergeant gets off the phone. I recorded this on video. 

He walks over and says, ‚Äúhe won‚Äôt be policing much longer.‚Äù

The energy company sent a representative to the scene to apologize and let me know that he doesn‚Äôt represent their company, he‚Äôs a private security guard hired third party.

The lieutenant gets there and tells me he‚Äôs gonna write me a ticket for interfering with a police investigation. He says my heart was in the right place but some people just can‚Äôt be taken up for (referring to the man). He tells me the ticket will be immediately thrown out in court when I tell them what happened and show the video. (Then why write it??)

Honestly at this point I feel like I‚Äôm in the Twilight Zone.

They tell me that the ticket is like one for peeing in the bushes or drinking a beer outside, it‚Äôs no big deal. The sergeant comes over to me and tells me, ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt get his badge number for you. His last name is ___. He works for _____ department.‚Äù

I spoke with lawyers last week who don‚Äôt seem to think there‚Äôs enough money attached to my chemical burns to warrant a massive multi department lawsuit. 

It is blowing my mind that everyone (the energy company, the city police, the witnesses) all agree that he was out of control and the video is evidence that he was never threatened nor afraid. And yet, there is still no accountability. 

I‚Äôve resorted to posting the video online and allowing it to spread so others can see it. It‚Äôs really starting to gain traction. I tried so many phone calls and run-around for days before finally just letting it speak for itself.

I don‚Äôt need money, I want him off the street. He doesn‚Äôt have the temperament for police work clearly and should not have a gun.

I just can‚Äôt seem to get anywhere and I refuse to let it go. What he did was so messed up, and he did it because he knew he could. 

Any advice would be really helpful. Thanks.

1n5ff9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1n5ff9y/how_ive_been_living_my_life/,How I've been living my life...,"This will be the longest and saddest post I'll ever do, but I don't care about how I feel from making this or how many people will come here or not; my voice needs to be heard. I appreciate the kind comments and hope that you give me however; talking to other people here makes me happy.

Anyway, here goes...

I've been... struggling... And it wasn't even to my adulthood, it was more than 5 years ago, since grade school, and I'm 20 now. I've been holding my emotions for the longest, and it was destroying me mentally and physically. And let it be known that it completely consumed me. 

Long story short, I'm a young 20-year-old person who is afraid of making mistakes, tries to be independent, and wants to talk to people like my parents and others, but hasn't had a chance to, and is afraid of being yelled at. All of the things made me who I am today...

I always pull a strong and composed facade every time in the face of pressure or when people are being strict and yelling at me. Quite possibly because I needed to ""be more grown up"" in my grade school days and improve as a person. But on the inside, I hated it immensely. And the bottled emotions keep eating me alive up until now. 

My depression grew when the teachers I had were too stern and harsh for me. I figured they act like this because they want to draw out their best from you and discipline the other students, preparing them for the challenges ahead. But to me, yelling and getting in trouble even when you're not causing it to show what they meant by that doesn't help me.

After I graduated high school in 2023, I lost contact with all my friends I've met and talked to, and a select few were in my MS, too. Probably because I was silent, shy, anxious to talk to the other graduates, but either way, I had no one whom I could rely on to spend time with or give me their support now...

This year, I'm leaning into adulthood, still living with my parents, and I'm still stuck with trying to fight the pressure myself. This year was hell for me. I've lost my wallet, I was scammed, I've witnessed the death of my family member, who I didn't even say I love them when they breathed their last, all the other bad things that are happening this year have affected me too...

I haven't been talking to my parents that much because of their busyness, and how they're physically hurting from their age and how they're working. They're the only ones I can talk to, too, so that hurt me even more. But what really hurt me is that I've told them I have been depressed some days, and they brushed me off, telling me to forget about it and move on, without so much as a comforting word. 

I even struggled to find a job in cybersecurity and anything besides that. I may not even get the job my peer gave me because of my bad interviewing skills.

But... what drove me to the limit is my dad swearing at me for making my dinner, even though I knew what I was doing. I said ""I don't get you,"" silently and to him. He replied, ""I don't get you!"" and walked to his room and closed the door.

That, and the immense amount of pressure and emotion that I've held up, it's hard to say, but I literally lost it, completely broken, lost the last shard of my sanity. I scratched my face with my hands, and threw and destroyed some items in my room. Then I looked at my hands with blood, and dashed to the mirror, and I silently whimpered ""What have I done..."", with the repeated ""I need help, I need help, I need help..."" 

I was really suicidal too, to the point where I wanted to find a way to kill myself, but I haven't gotten to it. Even so, my mind has those thoughts every day. It really started to grow last year, and I thought I could let it pass...

I never want this to happen, I never wanted to be like this, I look like I belong in a mental institute now. This is what happens when you're that emotionally unsafe to tell anyone anything about hoyou'reur hurting since it will make it worse, have no one to lean on, and just suffer in silence for almost a decade...

The day after that, I was making my coffee when my parents saw my face, and were worried about me, and I decided everything had to be said in its entirety, how I've been suffering, what bad things we've experienced, how I've been worried about them, how suicidal I am, everything... And now, after telling them everything, I've hurt them more by not telling them how I've really felt and how they've been treating me...

But they understand completely, and will do everything in their power to follow my wishes to the letter. To talk to them, to kindly tell me what I'm doing wrong, and to lean on them when I'm at my lowest. They've always been treating me well and want me to be happy and have fun... But on that day, they're hurt that I'm hurting... 

They hugged me and told me that they love me and all of that. Seeing that they actually care how I've felt finally made me break down and cry my first tears in 5 whole years. I had no regrets; truth be told, I've been wanting to release it for the longest time. But I did regret self-harming myself and promised to never do anything like that again. Thinking about how I've caused those scars still hurts to this day...

But now myemytting go did end happily. My parents apologized for being too stern to me, and I can talk to them more often *vice versa, try to find a social group for me, I can get in touch with my other family members, and they'll take me or make me be included in other activities I like. And I'm motivated to find a cybersecurity job or internship to learn and experience new things, and I'm less suicidal than I was before. All in all, everyone's happy that I'm happy now.

And, that's all there is to it...

This is a lesson for me, and let this be a lesson to all of you. Never let your feelings get to you or get sensitive over the little things, and it's fine to let all your feelings out and find some help from your family, no matter how painful or hard it can be. It's a hard lesson for me; life is tough, and it's hard for things to go your way, but it's okay not to be perfect, it's okay to not be okay, it's okay to see bad to experience the good. But it's never okay to hold your feelings to try to pull a strong face. You're strong enough, and you and I still have our lives to live proudly without hiding sorrow or despair. 

There is always light at the end of the tunnel. The only way to extinguish it is to throw it all away... I now know I'm not truly alone... ",0,1756701509.0,stories,0,0.5,False

Imagine a guy who desperately wants to have sex but is terrified of the consequences: STDs and kids. So, he does the smart thing: he wears a condom. Reasonable, right? I am sure all of you would approve. 


But what if he decides to go a little(?) further? He asks for a full sexual history of his partner. Then demands STD tests. Only when they come back clean, does he proceed‚Ä¶ while wearing two condoms. After all, what if one breaks? Better safe than sorry, right?


Till what point do you admire his caution‚Ä¶ and at what point do you start rolling your eyes? And more importantly, how long before his partner tells him to go screw himself?


That, in a nutshell, is Indian retirement planning. Except here, instead of condoms, people are layering lakhs and crores for every possible imaginary threat life could throw at them after 60.


- A INR 10 crore retirement corpus? ‚ÄúDoesn't FEEL enough‚Äù

- Another INR 2 crore for your kids‚Äô weddings? ‚ÄúWell, it's a once-in-a-lifetime thing‚Äù

- INR 1 crore for medical emergencies? ‚ÄúJust in case the medical insurance is inadequate‚Äù

- Another crore for ""miscellaneous expenses""? What on earth for? Godzilla repellents, maybe?


Indians are financially conservative to the point of absurdity when it comes to retirement. Their fear of running out of money is so extreme that they are willing to run out of life instead. They spend 40 years earning, hoarding, compounding‚Ä¶ and then what? Sit on a INR 10 crore pile while worrying about an INR 2 increase in milk prices?


This is not prudence, it‚Äôs financial hypochondria. Economic collapse in Sri Lanka? Work longer. Russia-Ukraine war? Work longer. Trump tariffs? You get the point. Every hiccup in the world becomes a reason to keep grinding. 


Yes, inflation is real. Yes, medical costs are rising. Yes, your child may want a destination wedding in Italy. But planning for every hypothetical with ultra-low SWRs (1-2%) and building a retirement corpus that could fund a small nation is not smart. It‚Äôs fear dressed up as wisdom. And those who advocate this are less financial advisors and more fearmongers.


Let‚Äôs call it what it is: the Indian middle-class disease; Frugalitis. The belief that any money spent on yourself is sinful unless it's for your child‚Äôs education, wedding or hospital bills. Heaven forbid you spend it on self gratification. 


To be clear, I am not writing this post for those 40+ folks who get boners only on the days the Sensex rises. I recognise a lost cause when I see one. This post is for those 20 something people who are dismayed by their corporate career and are yearning to live a life on their own terms. 


So, instead of preparing to live till 100 in a bulletproof bunker with gold bars under the bed, what if you planned like you actually wanted to enjoy the years you have earned? Travel, buy that ridiculously overpriced coffee machine, take salsa classes at 65‚Ä¶ spoil yourself a little.


Nobody ever says ‚ÄúI should have had more money‚Äù or ‚ÄúI should have spent more time in the office‚Äù on their deathbed. What they do regret is the trip not taken, the hobby abandoned, the relationship neglected. An incessant pursuit of safety will eventually take you to insanity. So don‚Äôt aim to die rich‚Ä¶ aim to live rich, in the only currency that really matters: time well spent.

- made remarks and made fun of about my ability to maintain a relationship/marriage (but only does this when her own family are present)
- said nothing while her husband and adult children have made fun of my relationship status, despite seeing I‚Äôm struggling with it
- made nasty comments to my children (once called my 13 year old daughter a ‚Äòstupid bitch‚Äô under her breath simply because my daughter said she hadn‚Äôt drunk any water all day during a visit to her new school
- turns up unannounced when she knows I‚Äôm working despite me asking her to text first
- blocked me from meeting up with her adult daughter (my niece) for coffee when she was visiting by saying they had other plans as a family but I could ‚Äòtag along‚Äô if I wished
- ‚Äòforgot‚Äô multiple times about plans, one which involved my daughter (her niece) cooking dinner for her and her husband
- made comments about my weight and allowed her husband to do the same
- doesn‚Äôt invite us over when they have family gatherings (she has a large family, we don‚Äôt have anyone else)
- shared very personal information about me and my children with her family, who have made fun of me/my kids to make sure I‚Äôm aware they know

They make it look like guys are still walking around in fedoras, 1920s suits, or oversized 80s land yachts. Or worse ‚Äî like frat kids in too-tight button-downs trying to cosplay ‚Äúformal.‚Äù None of that is even close to reality.

So I went ahead and made my own slideshow.

Here‚Äôs what it actually looks like by city/region:

New Jersey
This one‚Äôs almost comical. Jersey is packed with Italian Americans who still live in a Sopranos time warp. The show put Jersey on the mob map, so a lot of guys lean into that image. Fila sweatsuits, wife beaters, white slip-ons. The Perna brothers from the Lucchese Jersey crew are a textbook example ‚Äî arraigned looking exactly like extras from the show. Honestly, a lot of Jersey Italians dress like that even if they‚Äôre not connected.

Staten Island
Staten Island guys usually have more money, and it shows. You‚Äôll see Escalades everywhere. The Italian-American culture is still alive there, so yeah, you‚Äôll catch plenty of gold crosses, but they‚Äôre not as heavy into the caricature as Jersey. It‚Äôs a little cleaner, a little more polished, but still the same vibe.

Howard Beach (Queens)
Howard Beach is a sea of Nissan Altimas. No joke, you can‚Äôt drive through without seeing 20 of them. And the uniform? Designer sweatsuits. That‚Äôs not a stereotype ‚Äî it‚Äôs literally in the court docs. The 2017 Bonanno indictment (Ronnie G), the 2003 Gotti crew bust, even Sopranos actor Richard Maldone ‚Äî all described showing up in designer sweats to arraignments. That‚Äôs the Howard Beach look.

Philadelphia
South Philly mob guys basically have a uniform: black everything. Puffer jackets or nylon jackets, baseball caps, and always some Eagles gear. Surveillance photos of Borgesi, Mazzone, Lancellotti, Merlino ‚Äî it‚Äôs all the same look. If it‚Äôs black and has an Eagles logo, they‚Äôre wearing it.

Boston
The Patriarca family‚Äôs power shifted away from Providence toward Boston, and the Boston guys dress like your average middle-aged Boston dude. Think Celtics hoodies, flat caps, and jeans. Carmen ‚ÄúThe Cheeseman‚Äù DiNunzio is the perfect example. You‚Äôd never mistake him for anything other than a Boston guy at Dunkin‚Äô.

Chicago
The Outfit is different because they‚Äôve gone way more legit. They try to blend in with suburban businessmen now, so it‚Äôs golf shirts, khaki pants, and Skechers. Guys like Solly DeLaurentis and Gigi Rovito look more like they‚Äôre heading to the clubhouse than running rackets.",8,1756701160.0,Mafia,3,0.9,False

I just baked a fresh batch of Moroccan Fekkas, and I couldn‚Äôt resist sharing! These golden, crispy cookies are packed with almonds, anise, and sesame seeds ‚Äì perfect with mint tea, coffee, or even just as a crunchy snack üçµüç™



In Morocco, we often serve them during family gatherings, holidays, or simply as a cozy afternoon treat. The recipe has been in my family for years, and it's surprisingly easy to make!



Here‚Äôs everything you need:



üßÇ Ingredients:



4 eggs (save 1 yolk for brushing)



1 cup vegetable oil (150ml)



1 cup sugar (125g)



1 tbsp sesame seeds



1 tbsp anise seeds



Pinch of salt



1 packet baking powder (8g)



1 sachet vanilla sugar (about 7‚Äì8g)



250g whole almonds (you can toast them first)



Flour (as needed to form a soft, firm dough)



üë©‚Äçüç≥ Instructions:



1. Mix the dough:

Beat 3 whole eggs + 1 egg white with sugar and vanilla sugar.

Add oil, sesame, anise, salt, baking powder, and almonds.

Add flour gradually until the dough is soft but holds its shape.



2. First bake:

Shape the dough into logs. Place them on a lined tray.

Brush with the reserved yolk.

Bake at 180¬∞C (350¬∞F) for 20‚Äì25 minutes, until lightly golden.



3. Slice & second bake:

Let them cool completely (this prevents crumbling).

Cut into diagonal slices.

Return to oven at 160¬∞C (320¬∞F) for 10‚Äì15 mins, until crunchy.



üìù Notes & tips:



You can swap almonds for walnuts, pistachios, or dried fruits.



Don‚Äôt rush the cooling step before slicing ‚Äì it‚Äôs important!



Store in an airtight container ‚Äì they stay crispy for weeks.



üé• Video:



I also made a video showing the whole process ‚Äì from dough to slicing and second baking if you want you can check my  instagram

The label says it's from a sherry cask, and given the bottle number I am guessing it's from a sherry butt. The color and nose say refill, but I suppose it could be a first fill. The color is a deep rich cognac with a drop of red food coloring. 

First and foremost, the nose is sherry but it's easy to pick out marzipan, dried cherries and milk chocolate. The mouthfeel is initially quite smooth, but it quickly turns sharp with a steady burn. 

The palate is dried fruit, coffee and cigar smoke. I pick up chocolate and nougat on the finish. A few drops of water was death for this dram. All the subtle flavors were replaced by harsh acid notes. Definitely don't add water to this one!

I‚Äôm hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who‚Äôs up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations‚Äîwhether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I‚Äôm here for it.

About me: I‚Äôm known to be fun, especially if you‚Äôre the calm and fun type too. I‚Äôm well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit‚ÄîI run a lot. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors‚Äîhiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don‚Äôt drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you‚Äôre respectful and genuinely want to chat.

Thanks!",1,1756700791.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

What‚Äôs the best public spot to get some work done? A coffee shop in or near Hazel Dell would be ideal. Thank you in advance for your suggestions!",11,1756700747.0,vancouverwa,9,0.92,False

With no one to talk to, I had to find ways to stay alert and focused on my own.

I ended up sipping on a fizzy drink (the bubbles and the sharp taste seemed to help), and I had a solid playlist going with stuff I could hum or quietly sing along to while still keeping my attention on the road. It definitely helped, but there were a few stretches where the road just felt so long and honestly boring lol

It got me wondering what do other drivers do to stay alert on long drives, especially when you‚Äôre the only one awake? Do you rely on snacks, coffee, cold air, podcasts, chewing gum, or something else entirely?

If anyone here would be able to tell me something about them it would be greatly appreciated. I have the whole set of 4 plus a coffee mug and a T-shirt bag that looks like the one they sell at their online store. Thank you in advance, -Bri",1,1756700589.0,pawnstars,0,1.0,False
1n5f4cg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarchAgainstTrump/comments/1n5f4cg/the_stupidity_of_this_administration_boggles_the/,The Stupidity of this Administration Boggles the Mind...,"I'm traveling in Europe, reading the press, and I come across all kinds of articles about the stupidity of the Trump Administration; it's mind-boggling! It turns out we sanction Russia, and there is no Russian oil or gas that is supposed to be coming to Europe. So, the Russians sell their oil to India at a discount; the Indians then refine it and sell gasoline and diesel to Europe. 15% of Ukraine's fuel actually originates in India from Russian oil!!! It's f'ing hilarious.  And so on... other countries in Europe. We (as in the US government - Trump administration) get pissed off at India when we finally figure it out and then impose high tariffs on them! The Indians go running to China and Russia and reinforce (what was once a loose alliance) into a full-blown security and economic partnership with China and Russia. India, by the way, produces most of the world's intermediates for pharmaceuticals. This, in turn, will result in substantial cost increases for US manufacturers of drugs. And Apple was in the 'process' of moving its manufacturing to India... so what does this really imply for iPhone sales globally? 

Then, Trump's buddy, Bolsenaro, gets put under house arrest and is being prosecuted for trying to engineer a coup (much like Trump). So Trump wakes up one day, and says Okay, we will impose higher tariffs on Brazil. Brazil moves its coffee exports over to China, and China starts to buy soy beans and corn from Brazil, too. Note that we had a huge trade surplus with Brazil (not gone); Brazil is shifting its coffee exports to China (coffee prices have gone up in the US). China begins to purchase soybeans and corn from Brazil as well, and is starting to hurt our farmers badly (many on the verge of bankruptcy) because China basically stopped buying US ag products. We kill our trade with Brazil, and kill our own farmers. How smart is that?  

This entire trade policy issue is very complex and should not be left to knee-jerk reactions from Trump. The yo-yoing and inconsistencies that accompany his moods are just ridiculous and too consequential. This is entirely avoidable and, at the same time, foolish. We spent literally decades trying to rebuild friendship with major economic powers like India and Brazil for Trump's stupidity to burn those bridges - even if it's not intended. The idea that we can somehow dictate via tariffs is naive at best, stupid is probably a better word. People spend their entire careers studying trade policy. We can't score our own goals like this. And the tragedy is, there is absolutely no one standing up to the administration. Senators, etc, are all silent. Press is silent. You have to go overseas to find out what is actually going on.
