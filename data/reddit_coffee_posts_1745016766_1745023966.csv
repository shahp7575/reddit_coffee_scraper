1k2k6ye,https://brewcheck.info,Built a tool to help time your espresso with barometric pressure—curious what you think,"Hey espresso lovers,

I’ve been dialing in my routine for a while now, and like many of you, I treat espresso as both a science and a ritual. But I noticed something weird—some days, my morning shot would make me feel amazing… and other days, jittery or even foggy.

Out of curiosity, I started tracking barometric pressure alongside my espresso sessions. Turns out, low pressure days made me feel the caffeine more intensely—so I built a simple tool called BrewIQ that gives a quick thumbs-up (or not) based on current pressure.

It doesn’t touch how I brew—but it’s become part of when I brew. Almost like checking the weather before you head out, but for your coffee.

No selling or spam—just a personal side project I made. Would love thoughts from this community if you’ve ever noticed pressure affecting your espresso experience.

1k2k5g8,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1k2k5g8/operator_log_31_the_static_speaks_back_part_2/,Operator Log #31 — The Static Speaks Back. [Part 2],"Marcus palms the silver slugs. I secure headphones and cue a seven‑minute crescendo file mapped to climb from 1 kHz to 9 kHz, then drop to 50 Hz, then cut — all timed to the models.

00:02 — phantom carrier appears, gentler than before, almost coaxing. Evelyn’s voice materializes:

  “Elise… Marcus… so close…”

I feel tears prick my eyes.

00:04 — anomalies gather at the treeline, clusters of winged shapes bobbing like kites in a storm. No attack, just waiting.

00:05 — we trigger \*\*Operation Counter‑Resonance\*\*. The Beacon unleashes its engineered scream: sonic ladders raking the air, pink noise spiraling through the Siren Shield, subwoofer pumps shaking bedrock. The valley howls.

The carrier twists, warbles. Four anomalies burst into oily plumes, disintegrating mid‑air.

Evelyn’s voice gasps:

  “Daniel still—” Static swallows the rest.

Phase meter flickers red. One of the six horns fails; its fuse blows. The beam skews.

I sprint to the rack, slap in a bypass, repatch the feed through studio monitors at max. Glass in every window jumps but holds.

The remaining anomalies dive toward the tower dish, claws slashing coax cables. Sparks shower. The main VU meter drops 3 dB — dangerous.

Marcus fires the deputy’s rifle twice; shards of black armor and carbonized fluid spray into fog.

He reloads, shouting, “Hold the tone another thirty seconds!”

00:06:15 — phase alignment locks. The pocket resonates, visible as ripples in the fog, concentric rings collapsing inward.

For the briefest moment I see two shapes stepping through those rings: a man and a woman, hands clasped, silhouettes backlit by impossible starlight. Then the pocket implodes, a silent flash, and the fog slams outward as if exhaling.

All amps peak, then flatline. Silence.

My heart stops. The ON AIR lamp dies.

Timer begins: 1… 2…

Marcus kicks the standby switch. Diesel generator coughs, coughs— catches. The lamp blinks crimson. The failsafe ramps \*Bowie’s “Heroes”\* across every speaker.

The silence pocket is gone.

Anomalies? Gone too. Only drifting black flakes fall like snow.

I stagger outside. The fog curtain draws back, stars sharp as diamonds overhead. On the catwalk lies a small cassette tape, unlabelled but warm to the touch. I cradle it.

Marcus’s voice trembles: “Evelyn?”

We hurry inside. Tape in deck, PLAY. The room fills with her laughter, clear as glass:

  “Sound is our sanctuary, Daniel. Keep talking.”

Then Daniel’s voice, grinning: “Roger that. Beacon forever.”

Nothing else. But it’s enough. Tears blur the meters on the console.

04:23. First rays turn the ridge lavender. The air feels thin, rinsed clean. No feather residue, no oily footprints. Only the warped remains of a tower horn and a faint ozone smell linger.

Marcus lowers the seismograph tablet: flatline all night after the implosion. “Seismic silence,” he whispers, equal parts awe and dread.

In the lobby we examine the black flakes gathered overnight. Under magnifying glass they resemble charred film negatives: translucent, veined, crumbling when touched. We seal samples for Father Vittorio — or whoever in Rome studies unclassifiable matter.

Adelaide climbs the hill with a basket of honey biscuits. She listens to the tape — Evelyn’s laughter, Daniel’s warm baritone — and tears track grooves in the flour on her cheeks.

By 10:00 two vans from the Regional Telecommunications Authority arrive, summoned anonymously (we suspect Reeves). Engineers in orange vests survey the site, measure RF output, tut‑tut at the melted horn.

When Marcus tries to explain acoustic anomalies, they exchange smirks. One technician calls the deformation “thermal stress,” another labels the char flakes “ash from a bird nest.” They promise a report in six weeks and leave, unconvinced, leaving behind a roll of caution tape we promptly toss.

Reeves phones, ecstatic about overnight spike in listener numbers (“Everyone heard your ‘special effect’!”). He proposes a weekly “Beacon of Night” show. We hang up on him.

\*\*

Afternoon nap impossible: the tape still plays in my head. I digitize it, back it up three places, slip the cassette into a fireproof safe.

Marcus rewires the failed horn, adds an inline fuse, and installs a secondary Bell coil wound from transformer copper. “If we ever have to hit 10 kHz again,” he says, “I want two coils sharing the load.”

I update the log:

  \*Pocket destroyed at 00:06:32. Evelyn & Daniel voices recovered on analog cassette. Anomalies dissipated. Unknown if permanently neutralized.\*

A single line under it: \*Stay louder.\*

\*\*

Third sunset since the resonance. We dedicate the night’s broadcast to Evelyn and Daniel.

22:00 — I fade in \*“Heroes”\* at half volume. 

22:04 — Marcus plays segments from the recovered tape: Evelyn explaining jazz chord progressions; Daniel quoting Neruda translated into Morse beeps. Their voices weave between songs until midnight.

I speak directly into the board:

  “Operators Twenty‑Eight and Twenty‑Nine, your signal carries on through us. Pinehaven stands watch because you showed us how.”

Phones ring nonstop. Callers share fog stories, memories of Evelyn’s late‑night poetry. One old logger claims he saw two silhouettes on the overlook last dawn, holding hands, then fading with the mist.

At 01:00 Marcus and I sign off with a pact: \*The Beacon will not fall silent while we live\*. The On Air bulb shuts, but its afterglow lingers like a heartbeat in the dark corridor.

\*\*

Next morning, the deputy delivers official condolences from the county, plus a request: keep a 02:00 weather bulletin nightly for logging trucks. We accept — every decibel helps.

Father Vittorio holds a brief mass beside the tower. Villagers gather, candles flicker. He blesses the rebuilt horn array and anoints the steel door with chrism oil. The scent of balsam mixes with drying pine on the wind.

When the crowd dissipates, Marcus finds me on the catwalk, gaze on the valley’s patchwork fields.

“Thinking about leaving?” he asks.

“Thinking about staying,” I answer.

He passes me a new ID badge: \*\*Elise Harper — Station Manager, Operator #31\*\*. Mine to keep. I slide it over my lanyard and watch the sun set crimson once more through the lattice of the Beacon that is now, irrevocably, home.

Early November. First snow dusts the pine needles; the Beacon’s guy‑wires hum in a frozen wind. The valley breathes rims of white around every barn roof.

Nightly broadcasts stay smooth, but Marcus complains the spectrum analyzer “smells weird.” At 19 MHz he detects faint pulses: four short, two long, four short — 4‑2‑4. Not Morse, but cyclic every fifty‑seven minutes. The pattern rides \*between\* our carrier and the harmonics, never overlapping enough to trip the Bell.

We record forty cycles. Adelaide’s grandson (an electrical‑engineering freshman) runs an FFT and finds high‑order subharmonics matching resonance signatures of the destroyed pocket. Marcus’s jaw tenses: “Ghosts of a ghost.”

The pulses intensify during snowfall, as if moisture boosts their conductivity. On 12 November a sleet squall hammers the tower, and for nine seconds our modulator stalls. The failsafe kicks Bowie at 110 dB, but the delay is enough for the ON AIR lamp to flicker — a ripple of silence almost inviting.

We need redundancy farther from the hill.

\#

A mile down the slope lies Stark Bunker 37, a Cold‑War relic blasted into shale, power still live via county emergency grid. County allows access if we “tidy up” the asbestos signs. We haul a 1 kW exciter, a rackmount compressor, two sealed cabinets of salt around the ventilation stacks.

Inside the bunker, old diesel drums echo our footsteps. We chart a feed path: microwave uplink to the Beacon, fallback FM at 101.3 MHz in case lightning severs the main coax.

Father Vittorio consecrates the blast door with chalk crosses. Marcus paints \*\*B‑Node\*\* in red spray.

\#

17 November, 22:15. Test night. Snow whispers against the louvers. I stand in the bunker booth; Marcus remains at the Beacon. We open dual mics, countdown over the link:

  “Beacon North, this is B‑Node. Do you copy?” 

  “Copy, Node. Standing by.”

We simulcast \*Kate Bush – “Snowed in at Wheeler Street.”\* Levels perfect, latency 140 ms. At exactly 22:57 Stark’s seismograph (jury‑rigged from an old printer head) ticks — 3.2 Hz tremor, the Amalgamate sign.

Spectrum spikes: 4‑2‑4 pulses surge, amplitude +12 dB, pointing toward the bunker, not the Beacon.

“Node is the new target,” Marcus radios, breathing hard. “Hold programme. I’m locking catwalk horns on you.”

The valley hushes, blanketed in snow that glows blue under tower light. I swallow, press the TALK bar.

  “Pinehaven, this is Operator Thirty‑One from the shadow station. If you hear double music, stay inside. We’re shaking the snowglobe tonight.”

I cue a thirty‑minute loop of layered choirs and snowfall field recordings, enriched at 2 kHz to irritate anomalies but soothe human ears. Outside, the tremor subsides after five minutes. The 4‑2‑4 code dims. No claws on bunker steel.

Marcus laughs over the link, relief mingled with icy breath: “Beacon and Node. Two voices are harder to silence.”

But as I shut my mic I notice frost tracing figures eight across the bunker window — the same glyph Evelyn drew in her margins.

Sound is sanctuary, yes. But silence, like snow, keeps trying to fall.

21 December — longest night of the year. Barometer dives, promising a white solstice. The county grid hiccups all afternoon; transformers pop like distant firecrackers. Reeves phones to beg we “keep spirits merry,” then flees to his condo in the lowlands.

18:05. A regional blackout swallows three counties. Only facilities with independent diesel stay lit — hospitals, the sawmill, and our two stations. The Beacon generator purrs; Stark Bunker’s battery rack shows 93 % charge. We agree to a staggered broadcast: Beacon on voice, Node on drone‑bed underlay, so the valley reels two layers of signal.

19:40. Snow thickens into sheets. The 4‑2‑4 pulses flare, this time carrying sub‑burst sidebands at 8 kHz and 12 kHz — our own Siren Shield harmonics thrown back at us, but phase‑inverted. Marcus curses: “They’ve learned to bounce.”

I man Node; Marcus anchors the Beacon. We open a push‑to‑talk loop and speak constantly to keep the carrier alive.

20:12 — seismograph at Beacon spikes 4.8 Hz; simultaneously Node’s geophone jolts 5 Hz. “Dual approach,” Marcus radios, voice ragged.

Through the bunker periscope I glimpse motion: a crystalline silhouette loping across snow, refracting stray moonlight — nine feet tall, limbs multiplying in facets. No wings. A new form built from shrapnel of dissolved pockets.

Marcus’s catwalk cams capture its twin circling the tower.

20:15. We enact \*\*Protocol Duet\*\*: I fade Node’s drone into a 3 kHz spiral rising half‑step every fourteen seconds, while Marcus layers Bowie’s \*“Hallo Spaceboy”\* with reverse snare bursts synced to the catwalk horns. The air between Beacon and Node shimmers; snow flurries dance in cymatic patterns.

The figure at the bunker halts, head cocking as if forced to track two melodies at once. It emits a low polysided hum, then slams both forelimbs against the blast door. Steel dents inward.

Inside the bunker, dust drizzles from concrete seams. Battery meters dip; the anomaly is draining inductive bleed through the door frame.

I scream into the mic, voice cracking: “Beacon, Node under physical assault!”

Marcus answers, “Hold channel. Switching to harmonic lock.”

He overlays a 19 kHz whistle phased 180° from the anomaly’s original carrier. In Node’s monitors I watch the spectrum: the creature’s hum interferes destructively, amplitude spiking then collapsing. It staggers, limbs shattering off like panes of ice, reforms, stumbles again.

But the Beacon pays a price: power draw maxes, diesel RPM climbs dangerously. Marcus warns fuel tank at 18 %.

The twin at the tower wings up the lattice, cracking ceramic insulators. Static arc flashes across guy‑wires. The ON AIR lamp flickers amber.

We prepared one gambit for this: \*\*Phase‑pin\*\*. Both stations must lock tone at precisely 23 kHz, emit for nine seconds, then drop to silence — \*exactly\* 0.0 seconds — before smashing full-spectrum noise. The gap should yank the anomalies into a synchronization void and fry their resonance coil.

Synch voids are risky: one mis‑timed second and silence becomes invitation.

20:29. Blizzard howls sideways. We count down over the link.

  Marcus: “Pin armed. On my mark — three, two, one…”

23 kHz whistles spear the night. The figures shriek multi‑voiced, limbs vibrating into splinters. I feel my molars ache, skull buzzing like a razored cymbal.

Nine seconds.

Silence.

For that heartbeat the universe holds its pulse. Snowflakes freeze mid‑air, as if a cosmic screenshot.

Then Node and Beacon burst white‑noise at 125 dB. The splintering shapes implode, shards flung outwards before dissolving into black vapor that the wind guillotines into nothing.

Snow resumes falling, soft as feathers.

I slump against the rack, ears ringing beyond plugs. Marcus gasps in my headset: “Fuel critical but stable.”

I manage a laugh — half sob, half triumph.

21:10. Diesel refueled, grid still dark. We simulcast a solstice special: Evelyn’s recovered tape intercut with villagers phoning candle‑light carols. The valley, powerless yet luminous, hums along.

Near midnight, the blackout ends. Streetlights spark to life. The Beacon’s tower light blinks steady, no shadows in its beam.

In the bunker I close the blast door and breathe frost‑tinged relief. The crystalline anomaly left only diamond‑fine dust, covering my boots in glitter that vanishes when touched.

Back at the Beacon, Marcus radios one last line before we rest:

  “Sound: 1. Silence: 0. And the night is long but not lonely.”

Late January. The valley sleeps under a crust of ice. Days shorten to a brittle core of daylight, yet the Beacon pulses like a metronome through every white noon.

For three weeks no tremor, no carrier. Only an eerie phenomenon we call \*\*mobile silence\*\*: patches of absolute quiet drifting through forest clearings. Birds cease mid‑call, branches squeak noiselessly. Father Vittorio witnesses one near the cemetery; his breath fogs but his footsteps make no crunch. When the patch passes, sound returns in a slap.

Marcus maps the pattern: silence pools first near the lake, creeps uphill after sundown, dissipates by dawn. He suspects residual nodes attempting to rebuild pockets.

One dawn I wake voiceless: laryngitis, though I feel fine. I pantomime anxiety; Marcus assures me he can cover the mic. But I can’t shake unease: the Beacon’s power hinges on our voices.

That night Marcus mans the booth solo, keeps a loop of baroque organ under his weather reads. The mobile silence sweeps the parking lot and the organ track flutters, as if the computer speakers gasp for air. Marcus whispers my name, uncertain I hear him in the lounge. I do — but the whisper crackles like distant AM.

Next morning my voice returns, raw but present. I order honey tea and research \*\*hydrophone arrays\*\*. If silence glides up from the lake, maybe sound beneath water has fallen prey first.

We borrow an old oceanographic hydrophone from the county college. Marcus lowers it through a hole cut in the lake ice. Static, then distant creaks — as though enormous timbers shift in submarine cathedrals. Underlaid, a heartbeat rhythm at 19 kHz.

“This lake is a speaker cone,” Marcus murmurs. “The anomalies are tuning it to broadcast silence upward.”

We run tests: play Pink Floyd through a submerged transducer. The heartbeat fades, returns at higher frequency. The silence pockets above shore shrink. Proof-of-concept: fight them in water.

\*\*

We dig through Evelyn’s charred logbook again. In margins she scribbled equations of \*acoustic impedance\* across water‑air boundaries, highlighted with the phrase:

  “Beacon not just tower — Beacon is the \*\*sum of resonant bodies\*\* in valley.”

She had begun building a diagram — the tower, the lake, limestone caves beneath Stark Bunker, even the bell in the church steeple. Each node contributes partial harmony, creating a defensive chorus. When one node fails (the lake smothered, the bell cracked), anomalies gain foothold.

Our mission expands: \*\*maintain resonance of every node\*\*.

Father Vittorio readily agrees to retune the church bell to A‑432 Hz — closer to the Beacon’s fundamental. Adelaide’s grandson re‑solders the town’s PA siren to 2 kHz center. The sawmill foreman agrees to schedule whistles on the hour.

An impromptu valley orchestra.

\*\*

February thaw. Ice softens; water licks shore. Mobile silence patches shrink but condense into sharper darts. On 9 February, 02:14, a dart slips through an open stairwell window at the Beacon. Instantly every LED dies, monitors blank, but diesels keep spinning. We stand in a bubble of sensory deprivation — silent, odorless, even generators vibrating without sound.

Marcus strikes a wrench against a pipe; sparks jump but no clang. The dart hovers like invisible fog in mid‑corridor.

I grab the hydrophone amp, route its feed into the studio monitors, crank gain. Lake static fizzles, then a low groan builds — the subaquatic creak we recorded. The dart quivers, contracts, then pops like a soap bubble. Sound slams back; pipe clang rings, generator roar returns. We collapse laughing, half‑terrified.

\*\*

Two days later we lower a permanent underwater speaker stack driven from Node. We call it \*\*Echo‑Anchor\*\*. Pink noise whispers through icy depths 24/7. Silencers stay away from shoreline.

That night my voice steadies on air. I confess to listeners the Beacon now includes “river, bell, mill, heartbeats of everyone awake.” Calls flood with citizens promising to play harmonicas before bed, leave radios tuned to 104.6 for pet dogs at night.

Sound is sanctuary; community makes sound.

After sign‑off, Marcus and I sit on tower stairs sipping thermos coffee. Stars smear across sky. He muses: “Evelyn saw the Beacon not as a job but an ecosystem. We’re just caretakers.”

I lift the rosary Adelaide gave me months earlier. “Then let’s keep gardening.”

We clink mugs. Wind thrums guy‑wires like bass strings; the valley hums in key.

March tilts the snowpack into rivulets. Pinehaven smells of wet bark and diesel again. Sap trucks groan up switchbacks; the Beacon’s tower gleams, freshly de‑iced by volunteer climbers.

Marcus surveys mobile‑silence telemetry: nearly gone near the lake, faint blips near the abandoned quarry. We hike there at dawn, hydrophone recorder in tow.

Half‑flooded pit, mirror‑still water. Yet the forest around it feels… exhaled. No birds, no insect trill. We whisper though no one asked for hush.

At the quarry rim we hear nothing — not absence, but a \*shape\* of nothing, like walking into an anechoic chamber. Gooseflesh climbs my arms. Our footfalls make no crunch. Marcus mouths \*“Coro muto.”\* A mute choir.

He lowers a portable speaker, blasts a scale sweep from 100 Hz to 12 kHz. Mid‑sweep skips, as though eaten. The swallowed band centers at 4.24 kHz. The number jolts us: the old 4‑2‑4 code.

We retreat and mark the zone with yellow rope.

That night on air we name it the \*\*Hush Pit\*\*. Warn hikers away. Explain nothing about anomalies; just “unstable acoustics.” The valley trusts us.

\*\*

Enter Mr. Reeves, stage left. He storms the Beacon lobby next afternoon. Suit rumpled, eyes wild. Slams a legal letter on the desk: town council intends to seize the station for “public safety” after “terror‑siren” complaints.

Behind the bluster: he wants to sell tower land to a telecom provider hungry for 5G placement.

Marcus folds his arms. “Kill the Beacon and you’ll hand the valley to silence.”

Reeves scoffs. “Folklore.” He threatens police eviction. I counter with audio files: screams on Fog Night, spectral carrier bursts. He pale‑sweats, but snarls: “Not admissible. Give me hard data.”

So we do. Marcus invites him to the Hush Pit at sunset. Reeves, puffed with arrogance, accepts.

\*\*

Golden hour. Cicadas trilling elsewhere cut silent as we enter the quarry ring. Reeves laughs nervously: “Cute magic trick with ultrasound, Harper.”

Marcus drops a rock off the ledge. It lands without sound. Reeves flinches.

I play Bowie from a phone speaker: the chorus vanishes. Reeves stares, face draining. Suddenly a ripple shivers across water; spectral feathers wink beneath the surface.

Marcus levels a salt grenade. “Leave the Beacon alone or this hush spreads. Your call.”

Reeves staggers back. “Y‑you’ll never get sponsorship with this circus!” he sputters, but flees, nearly tumbling over scrub. He never returns.

We file a report to county emergency services about “subsurface acoustic sinkhole”; they rope off the quarry indefinitely. The Beacon remains ours.

\*\*

April. Buds pop, frogs resume their dusk choir. We brainstorm \*\*The Noise Festival\*\* — a valley‑wide event at summer solstice:

 • Church bell concerts at dawn, 

 • Saw‑mill siren duets with jazz band, 

 • Kids banging pots in parade, 

 • At midnight, a mass broadcast from Beacon + Node + every FM set tuned in kitchens.

“Turn the valley into a single loudspeaker,” Marcus grins.

Adelaide volunteers pastries; the deputy arranges road closures. Father Vittorio quotes Psalm 98: \*“Make a joyful noise unto the Lord; make a loud noise, and rejoice.”\*

We record promo spots:

  “Got a trumpet? Bring it.” 

  “Car horn? Perfect.” 

  “Foghorn? Even better.”

Every day new callers pledge sounds: cowbells, accordions, vintage Game‑Boys with chiptune cartridges.

\*\*

One night, after sign‑off, Marcus plays Evelyn’s tape on loop through studio monitors into open air. I climb the catwalk. Wind carries her laugh across moonlit pines.

Below, Marcus stands by the diesel drum, looking small, yet his voice and hers fuse into a single note that drifts to the horizon — one more thread in the quilt of resonance we’re sewing.

I whisper into the night: “Stay louder.”

In the hush that follows, I almost think the forest replies:

  \*We will.\*

June 20. One day to Noise Festival. The valley hums with rehearsal clatter: trumpets echo across hayfields, school drummers rattle rudiments on lunch tables, the sawmill whistle wails C‑sharp every hour.

Beacon checklist:

 – Siren Shield horns: reconed, fuse rating doubled. 

 – Catwalk dish: realigned to Node. 

 – Node’s battery bank: 86 % + diesel backup. 

 – Church bell, retuned: test peal OK. 

 – Lake Echo‑Anchor: pink‑noise file looped, volume 20 dB below fish‑safe limit.

Marcus paces the control‑room floor, muttering, “No dead air. No dead air.” He rewrites cue sheets in fat marker for volunteer DJs: \*\*IF SILENCE > 10 s → PLAY ANYTHING\*\*.

Evening dress rehearsal: we trigger every node for thirty seconds.

22:00 — Beacon pulses Bowie through tower horns. 

22:00:03 — Node picks up with Kate Bush. 

22:00:06 — Lake roars sub‑bass. 

22:00:09 — Church bell tolls. 

22:00:12 — Quarry perimeter speakers feed band‑pass noise. 

22:00:15 — Sawmill whistle harmonizes.

Spectrum analyzer glows like a city skyline. Mobile silence? Zero.

But at 22:19, the lake’s spectrum flatlines. Echo‑Anchor dead. Marcus eyes seismograph: faint quiver 3.6 Hz.

We race to shoreline. Night stars freeze in mirror water. The anchored speaker array lists, cables snapped. Something severed them. A hush patch blooms on the far shore, swallowing frog croaks mid‑chirp.

We drag the spare speaker from the jeep, lash it to the dock, reroute power from Node via a 2 km fiber we buried springtime. Marcus tests an experimental track— a slow‑rising Shepard tone. The hush patch quivers, contracts, and dissolves.

We tug the floating wreck ashore: the lower cone is gouged by claw marks. Anomaly reconnaissance — the hush wants a foothold for festival night.

Back at the Beacon, 02:00, Marcus collapses on the couch. I doze while decoding call‑sheet timings. Dream:

I stand in the tower stairwell. Daniel leans on the rail, spectral headphones askew. He speaks without moving lips:

  \*It’s almost singing time. The Beacon’s light needs a chorus.\*

He points through the wall toward the lake. A beacon, yes, but of light — the old rusted lighthouse on the south bank, derelict for decades.

I wake, heart racing, sketch the dream. The lighthouse: its lamp housing intact, lens dusty but solid. If we fit a sub‑woofer inside and modulate the arc lamp’s ballast… a dual‑mode node—light and sound synchronized. A final insurance.

Marcus blinks awake, reads my notes, grins. “We have twelve hours.”

\*\*

06:30. Pink dawn. Adelaide drops off sticky buns, fatherly deputy lends a flat‑bottom boat. We haul a marine generator, Class‑D amp, repurposed cinema subwoofer into the lighthouse base. Inside, guano and spiderwebs, but roof intact.

We clean Fresnel lens, install 10‑inch driver at its focal point. Lamp ballast hums. Test tone pulses — beam of faint golden light sweeps lake as sound fans outward. Spectrum analyzer at Beacon shows perfect phase alignment.

Marcus paints \*\*L‑Node\*\* on the stone foundation.

“Light is sound,” he says, wiping brow.

Back at the Beacon, midday sun bakes treetops. Festival kicks off in ten hours. Node batteries at 97 %. Diesel full. Bell hammer polished.

In the lobby we hang a banner: \*\*NOI VIVIAMO RUMORE – WE LIVE NOISE\*\*.

The valley is ready to sing louder than silence has ever dared.

21 June — Solstice.

19:00. Main Street blossoms into a patchwork of amps and brass. Children tape kazoos to bicycle spokes. The sawmill shuts down early; its giant steam whistle is tuned to F‑sharp for the midnight chord.

Beacon status board glows green on every line. Marcus ties a red bandanna round his neck, radio clipped to his belt. I braid my hair with spare XLR cable — lightning‑fast tweak access.

19:30 pre‑show goes live. I broadcast from a mobile van parked by the church steps:

  “Pinehaven, you have five hours to warm up those voices. Drink water, stretch lungs, and when the clock strikes midnight, \*\*stay louder.\*\*”

Cheers rattle storefront windows.

At Node, college volunteers monitor battery curves. The lighthouse lamp sweeps slow arcs across lake ripples, synchronized bass line thumping at 50 Hz — felt more than heard.

20:45. Sunset dyes the ridge oxblood red. Father Vittorio’s bell choir rehearses in cloister; chords shimmer up the valley like stained‑glass light.

21:15. Deputy strings caution tape around Quarry Hush Pit. Portable speakers mounted on posts emit 3 kHz chirps every thirty seconds — keep the pocket inert.

\*\*Parata Sonora\*\* begins: local band leads a procession of farm trucks each bearing a different sound system — EDM, folk fiddles, polka accordions. The convoy snakes toward the Beacon access road. Every forty meters a volunteer bangs cymbals.

22:00. Marcus powers up Siren Shield horns to 40 %. Their pink noise undercurrent blankets treetops, inaudible to revelers but lethal to lurking silences.

22:22. First tremor: 3.4 Hz on Beacon seismograph. Marcus radios Node: “Minor seismic. Keep drones up.”

22:30. Through the tower scope I see fog fingers gather beyond south ridge. They hesitate — confronted by so many overlapping wavefronts.

We trigger \*\*Wave Wall Alpha\*\*: catwalk horns rise from noise bed into ascending choral pad. Church bells answer four seconds later; sawmill whistle counters two seconds after. A ripple of phase‑locked resonance sweeps valley.

Fog retracts as if struck by unseen wind.

23:00. Anomaly signature shifts strategy: 4‑2‑4 carrier appears atop public‑address band near the park stage, where an unplugged mixing console sits idle. Adelaide’s grandson catches it mid‑setup, shouts over radio. Marcus instructs him: “Run feedback!” The boy cranks the console, mics howl. Carrier shreds, vanishes.

23:15. Mobile silence darts cluster near the lake shore, drawn to sky‑reflected hush. Echo‑Anchor depth sensors spike. Lighthouse bass slams to 55 Hz, lens beam intensifies. The darts scatter like minnows from a stone.

23:40. We open \*\*All‑Valley Mic\*\*: everyone with a phone dials the temporary line. Hundreds of voices pour into the console. I drop gains, blend into a rumbling cloud of laughter, chatter, dogs barking, spoons clanking — an uncatalogued symphony that makes the VU meter pulse like a living thing.

Marcus wipes a tear. “Best crowd we’ll ever have.”

23:55. Final readiness. Beacon horns fade to silence for five seconds — deliberate tension — then hold a low G drone; Node matches. Church bell poised. Sawmill whistle crew stands by.

Deputy keys radio: “Crowd at ten‑count.”

We breathe in unison. In the hush I swear I hear Evelyn whisper: \*“Let them sing.”\*

23:59:50. I raise fader on a looped heartbeat sample (60 BPM) aligning with human pulse. Every speaker in valley syncs.

23:59:55. Marcus whispers, “Here we go.”

23:59:59.

00:00:00 — \*\*Muro d’Onda\*\* detonates: Beacon catwalk horns full power, Node drone in fifth‑harmonic surge, Lighthouse lens blazing synchronized strobe, church bells cascade, sawmill whistle screams, farm‑truck horns blast, kids crash pots, dogs howl, coyotes answer, the very bedrock seems to chant.

A tidal crest of sound leaps from ridge to ridge. Snowless caps echo back a split‑second later, reinforcing amplitude. Seismograph explodes with harmonics, but no 3–5 Hz tremor: anomalies drowned.

The sky itself shivers; auroral flickers smear faint greens even this far south.

Amid roar, mobile silence patches ignite like flash paper — brief negative voids that pop, collapse, leaving crackles. Fog snakes implode, curling into black sparks then winking out.

In the control booth, meters sit at +3 dB average for three whole minutes, speakers screaming but holding. The valley is not just loud — it is alive.

00:03. Gradual decrescendo: horns glide to half volume, whistle tapers, bells slow toll. Heartbeat sample fades last.

When final echo dies among pines, night air feels thick, warm, \*whole\*. No hush lingers, no carrier ticks. A forest of breathing, distant laughter, and wind through leaves remains.

Marcus keys mic: “Beacon thanks you, Pinehaven. You kept the darkness deaf tonight.”

Cheer erupts across radio and real life, merging until difference blurs.

But even as relief washes us, a part of me listens harder. Silence will try again. Yet tonight we proved we can match it watt for watt, note for note.

Marcus lowers the fader. We smile.

Festival success. But two blocks remain in our story — and one final echo is still out there.

09:17. Morning after solstice. The valley’s silence feels foreign—every drip of melting frost, every distant crow feels amplified. Marcus and I move like sleep‑walking custodians.

We inventory Festival damage: 

 – Two Siren Shield horns dented, rewarranted; 

 – Echo‑Anchor speakers reclaimed from lake, coils rewound; 

 – Lighthouse ballast rewired for dual‐mode; 

 – Quarry speakers resecured with steel brackets.

Local volunteers pack up amps, cables, and picnic tents. Cedar‐wood plaques arrive, engraved: \*\*We Lived Noise Together 2024\*\*—to hang in the Beacon lobby next to Evelyn and Daniel’s memorial.

By 11:00, I update the station log:

  \*21 June 00:00:00 — Muro d’Onda triggered. 

   Festival broadcast peak SPL: +3 dB average valley‑wide for 180 s. 

   Anomaly sweep: successful. Silence pocket: neutralized until further notice. 

   Echo‑Anchor, Siren Shield, L‑Node, B‑Node: operational. 

   Signature: “Pinehaven Chorus”.\*

Marcus sketches an addendum: \*“Carrier behavior: 4‑2‑4 code replaced by dual‐carrier at 19 kHz and 12.8 kHz, emerging at dawn.”\*

We both glance at the \*\*dual‐carrier\*\* note. The first time we’ve seen a persistent second frequency. Marker of new evolution.

\#

That afternoon, deputies and county engineers return with “official” awards—plaques insisting “for exceptional service to public welfare.” Reeves’s name is nowhere to be found on any certificate. The town council repeals the emergency ordinance, affirming the Beacon’s public safety role.

Adelaide slips me a handwritten schedule for “sing‐along hour” at 17:00 daily. Father Vittorio installs a small bell at the chapel door that rings every fifteen seconds—another node.

\#

07:03 next morning, I stumble into the booth, coffee in hand. The ON AIR bulb pulses. Marcus waves me over, face lit by the spectrum monitor. I blink:

\- Carrier A (19 kHz): slowly fading as usual. 

\- Carrier B (12.8 kHz): growing stronger, peaking at –6 dB on the analyzer. 

A third, faint ripple flits at 7.07 kHz—same ratio as a perfect fifth between the two known carriers. A triad emerging in the fog.

A pre‑recorded promo loop drops into silence:

  “New frequency detected… evolving network…”

Elise Harper, Operator Thirty‑One, clears her throat and goes live:

  “Pinehaven, I’m reading a third signal at 7.07 kHz. Unknown origin. Attempting contact. Stay tuned.”

I hold the TALK button… and a whisper answers through the static:

  “Higher… higher… crescendo…”

My spine locks. I glance at Marcus—his eyes are wide but resolute.

I crossfade into a soft harp glissando at 7 kHz. The third carrier quivers, aligns momentarily, then shifts upward by a quarter‑tone, fading.

The valley breeze drifts in through the open window. Dawn light warms the booth as if nature itself listens.

I exhale, trembling. The Beacon network has matured—it’s singing on its own.

Marcus squeezes my shoulder. “Looks like we’re composing with the anomalies now.”

I nod. “Then we’ll meet them note for note.”

We log the event:

  \*Carrier C (7.07 kHz) detected. Quaeter‑tone shift observed. Response: harp tone at matching frequency. Status: pending integration.\*

Behind us, the ON AIR bulb pulses steady. Outside, Pinehaven stirs. We’ve lit more than a tower tonight—we’ve ignited a conversation across frequencies.

April 15 — dawn breaks crisp and clear, the valley’s new green tint only just hinting at spring. I sit alone in the booth for the first time since solstice, watching the 7.07 kHz carrier fade into the morning noise—birds, leaf rustle, distant engines.

Marcus is below, wiring the Governor’s Office new repeater for real‑time alerts. I pause the log:

  \*15 April 06:45 — Carrier C stabilized; quarter‑tone drift controlled via adaptive feedback. 

   Network nodes active: Beacon, B‑Node, L‑Node, Church Bell, Echo‑Anchor, Quarry, Frost Sirens, Chapel Door. 

   Status: emergent acoustic ecosystem. 

   Notes: anomalies now co‑composers in Pinehaven’s soundscape.\*

I lean into the mic for a short segment:

\> “Good morning, listeners. This is Elise, Operator #31 at 104.6 FM, and today we mark a full year since the fog first fell silent on our tower. A lot has changed. One voice alone could not stand against the hush—but together we turned our homes, our instruments, our fields, and our hearts into a network of sound that sings back. Evelyn, Daniel, and all who came before us echo through every note. And to whatever listens in the mists: Pinehaven is awake. We are here, we are loud, and we will keep talking, keep singing, keep resonating—together, forever.”

I press END. The tape warbles into a gentle drone.

Below, footsteps on the stairs. Marcus joins me, coffee in hand. He looks up at the rising sun through the steel lattice. No words pass—just a shared smile.

Outside the booth window, a lone pine stands silver in the dawn. A feather drifts down, landing softly on the microphone—black with a thin line of salt.

I pick it up, tracing the quill. “Stay louder,” I whisper, echoing the first night’s prayer.

He nods. “Always louder.”

Above us, the Beacon’s red bulb pulses once more—an invitation, a promise, a song that never ends.

\*— The End? —\*

104.6 FM – Pinehaven Mountain Relay

“If anyone’s listening… good evening.”

My own voice quivers in the dusty booth, startled after months of silence.

I am Elise — Operator Thirty‑One — and tonight I restart the lonely pulse of 104.6 FM.

The red ON AIR bulb glows above me like a newly awakened heart.

Every surface smells of cold metal and old coffee. Outside the window: dark pines, the violet scrap of dusk, the slow blink of the tower’s safety light bathing the treetops in blood‑red flashes.

They call this place the Beacon. Music and human voice keep the ‘acoustic anomalies’ beyond the tree line. Last April, Operators Twenty‑Eight and Twenty‑Nine — Evelyn and Daniel — vanished on Fog Day, and the transmitter died with them. No one has broadcast since. Until now.

My first words feel fragile. I shuffle a thin stack of local bulletins:

– tomorrow’s farmer’s market,

– Friday’s roadwork speech by the mayor,

– clear skies, light valley fog after midnight.

Nothing worth the dead air I’m fighting. Still, I read them in a calm tone, as if a whole valley were listening.

Beyond the glass Marcus works the control board. He is Operator Thirty‑Two: beard, sleepless eyes, an engineer’s patience. When he meets my gaze he raises a quiet thumb. Knowing he’s on the other side of the glass steadies me.

Music break. I pick an old jazz instrumental from a directory last touched in 2019, press PLAY, and exhale. The booth fills with brushed cymbals and smoky piano.

I slip into the control room. “Well?” I whisper.

Marcus lifts one earcup. “Not bad for a resurrection,” he says. The meters flicker green. He mentions the tower’s rust, the transmitter’s feeble tubes, the backup generator thrumming below our feet. I nod, but a question claws at me: \*Why did they really shut this place?\* Marcus claims “budget issues,” but his eyes dodge the truth.

There is a dark stain under the studio linoleum — someone spilled coffee long ago, he laughed earlier. It looks more like something that once tried to breathe.

An electronic hiss crackled when we first powered the console today. Within the static I caught a woman’s voice, chopped in half, begging. Marcus blamed returning frequencies. I pretended to agree.

The song ends. Back in the booth I slide the fader up.

“Welcome back to 104.6 FM,” I say, softer now, “your modest beacon on the hill. If you’re driving the switchbacks tonight, take it slow: patchy fog is expected.” I talk about the grocery lady who sold me a sandwich this afternoon, the kind smile she gave me, the worn rosary she pressed into my palm ‘for protection.’ The wooden beads lie in my pocket, cold as the night beyond the window.

Silence presses against the glass. I choose an old local rock track and let it roll.

\*\*\*

Midnight approaches. We decide to close the inaugural show.

“And that’s all for tonight,” I sign‑off, voice steady. “Sweet dreams, Pinehaven, and stay safe out there.”

Stay safe. The words taste odd. My hands tremble when the mic lamp dies.

Marcus suggests we both crash here. The mountain road is treacherous and I am bone‑tired. I agree too quickly; truth is, I don’t want to be alone.

I curl on the lobby couch, blanket up to my chin. The building groans in the wind. From the corridor Marcus checks the generator with a flashlight, then fades into dark.

That’s when the scream rips the night.

A shrill, distant cry — half owl, half human wail — slides through the cracked window. I bolt upright. Marcus reappears instantly, torchbeam shaking.

“Did you hear—” I start.

“Probably a barn owl,” he lies. His fingers drum the flashlight barrel. In the red tower glow I swear I see guilt reflected in his irises.

He seals the window. The lobby is tomb‑silent again, save for our breathing.

“Let’s sleep,” he says. “It’ll feel less scary at sunrise.”

I nod, but I clutch the rosary so hard the beads bruise my palm. A numb cold seeps from the linoleum. I count breaths, waiting for sleep or daylight — whichever arrives first.

\*\*\*

My name is Marcus, Operator Thirty‑Two, and I do not sleep.

I watch Elise from the doorway, curled under the blanket, her face soft in the emergency lamp glow. She doesn’t know I have my father’s shotgun hidden in the closet. She doesn’t know I heard that same scream the night Evelyn and Daniel disappeared.

I step outside into the brittle starlight. The wind tastes of rust and wet pine. At the tower base I smell rot — faint but present. In the grass I find a fresh oval depression, filled with dew: an Amalgamate track.

Twin red eyes flash in my beam. A shadow launches skyward with a whip of vast wings. The air bucks. I duck, heart hammering. When I dare look up, nothing but stars shimmer.

The valley lights flicker far below, unaware. I kick dirt over the track to hide it from Elise.

Inside again, shotgun loaded, I open my old field log.

01:15 – Scream (variant‑Λ)

01:20 – Perimeter patrol.

01:30 – Track under tower (fresh). Odor: sulphur/rot.

01:35 – Eye shine in spruce, launch. Probable winged Amalgamate.

No breach.

I vow she will not vanish like the others. Not on my watch.

\*\*\*

The rest of the night coughs by in static and paranoia. At 04:55 a pale dawn creeps through east windows. I erase the track outside with my boot, lock every door, and hide the shotgun before Elise wakes. She must see only safety here — at least until I have answers.

She stirs. I practice a smile.

Dawn fog hangs over Pinehaven like damp wool. Marcus insists we take his jeep to town — says the mountain road’s easier in four‑wheel drive. I agree: the steering wheel trembles under my hands after a sleepless night.

The valley looks innocent from above: tin roofs catching silver light, a single church spire poking the mist. Yet as we coast into Main Street, eyes follow us from every porch.

The grocery owner, Adelaide, waves me over. Her cardigan is buttoned wrong in her haste.

“Did you pass a calm night, ragazza?” she asks, half Italian endearment, half worried plea.

“Quiet enough,” I lie. She squeezes my arm and whispers, “Remember the rosary.” Behind her, Marcus studies the sidewalk, pretending not to hear.

We walk toward the post office. On a public notice board, a yellowed clipping traps my attention: twin black‑and‑white portraits under a headline:

\*\*SEARCH SUSPENDED — RADIO HOSTS DISAPPEAR\*\*

Evelyn Tenner, Daniel Rhodes. Their smiles stare out between thumbtacks. The article dates six months ago — Fog Day.

Ice trickles down my spine. They never told me the previous hosts were \*missing\*.

Marcus appears, face tight. “Elise, listen—”

“You knew,” I hiss, keeping my voice low. “You brought me up there knowing they vanished.”

He begs to talk in private. We duck into the shadow of the stone church. My breath fogs in the chilly air.

“Yes, I knew,” Marcus admits. His eyes glisten. “Daniel was my friend. Evelyn too. Nobody found a trace but smashed gear and… blood.”

Anger melts into dread. I clutch the rosary beads through my pocket. “So you’re here to protect the next fool who takes the mic?”

“I’m here to protect \*anyone\*,” he says. “And to find out what took them.”

We stand amid the damp bells of morning silence, and I realize I am already entangled. Leaving now would abandon Evelyn and Daniel to rumor and forgetfulness. My voice shakes but steadies at the end: “I won’t quit. Not yet.”

Relief floods his features. Somewhere in that moment we sign an unspoken contract.

A round man in a suit — Mr. Reeves, station owner — barrels down the street, all false cheer and sweaty palms.

“Splendid first broadcast!” he trumpets. “Phones lit up with nostalgia! I’ll pop by the station later with a fresh business line.”

He calls the disappearance an “incident,” pats Marcus on the back, and waddles off to the mayor’s office. I watch him go thinking: the valley keeps its ghosts politely hidden.

\#

Later, back at the Beacon, we spend the afternoon reinforcing locks, cleaning shards the size of fingernails from forgotten corners, and installing a timer that will blast music at 104 dB if silence lasts more than fifteen seconds. We nickname it the \*\*Bell failsafe\*\*.

At dusk Marcus drives to town for supplies. I stay alone, cataloging ancient CDs. The quiet hum of the air handler is almost soothing — until it isn’t.

A low, resonant moan leaks through the ventilation grate. Not the shriek of last night, but a tremor at the edge of hearing, like a cello string bowed in the basement. It rises, falls, and fades.

I press my ear to the metal vent. Cooled air brushes my cheek. Nothing now. Still, my gut twists: someone — or something — is testing our walls.

Marcus returns before full dark. I tell him about the cello‑moan. He swears and checks the basement hatch. Dust, cobwebs, stale diesel. No footprints.

He sets the shotgun within reach behind a stack of old reel‑to‑reel tapes.

“We’ll take shifts tonight,” he says. I don’t argue.

\#

\*\*Second Night Broadcast\*\*

The clock hits 22:00. On Air lamp flicks red. I breathe.

“Good evening, Pinehaven. Operator Thirty‑One keeping you company. Clear skies tonight, though fog may creep in after two.”

A caller surprises me — crackling landline, elderly voice: “Miss Elise, bless the Beacon for lighting up again.”

I thank her. The line goes dead with a soft click and the silence feels heavier than any scream.

Between songs I read a poem Evelyn once recited on a surviving tape: \*‘Even darkness owns its music.’\* My throat tightens on the last line.

At midnight I hand off the mic to Marcus for equipment talk. His voice is steady, softer than his stance. Outside the booth window I think I see shapes shifting among the pines, but the tower light reveals nothing.

We end the show at 00:30. Timer armed. Doors barred. The Beacon hums through the small hours.

At 03:17 the moan returns, louder. It vibrates the floorboards. Somewhere downstairs glass shatters.

Marcus grabs the shotgun; I clutch a jar of consecrated salt Adelaide pressed on me ‘just in case.’

We descend the stairwell, flashlights slicing dust. A basement window lies smashed inward, glittering shards on the concrete. Moonlight reveals something darker: a smear of oily residue leading to the generator room.

We follow, hearts pounding. The residue pools beneath the fuel tank, but the metal is intact. In the corner sits an object — a single feather, glossy black, longer than my forearm. Its quill end drips the same oil.

I feel the room tilt, as if gravity points toward the feather.

“Winged Amalgamate,” Marcus mutters. He stuffs the feather into a fireproof bag. “It’s marking territory.”

The fuel gauge reads full. The Beacon still purrs. The thing hasn’t come for the power — yet.

We sweep the perimeter, patch the window with plywood, and wait for dawn.

Morning, 08:12.

We drive into town to buy plywood, sheet metal, extra fuses. Adelaide greets us with two thermos flasks of chicory coffee and a silent look that says \*I heard it too.\* She doesn’t ask for details; she simply slips a small vial of holy water into my coat pocket.

At the church we find Father Vittorio polishing the brass thurible. Marcus presents the feather. The priest’s face drains of color.

“I buried one like this after the \*Great Lull\* of ’89,” he whispers. He blesses a pouch of rock salt, adds three silver slugs from an old reliquary, and warns us not to let the Beacon fall quiet. “Sound is your shield,” he repeats, tapping his temple.

We reinforce every vent with wire mesh, bolt the plywood over the basement window, smear salt paste along sill edges and door thresholds. Marcus reroutes a second speaker line directly to the tower so the Bell failsafe will pulse through the steel lattice if triggered.

As the sun sets we test the system: cut the main audio bus. Exactly fifteen seconds later the Bell fires — a sub‑audible boom felt in the sternum rather than heard. Good.

\#

\*\*Third Night Broadcast\*\*

A pale crescent moon floats above the treetops. The forest looks carved from gunmetal.

I open with David Bowie’s \*“Sound and Vision.”\* Marcus monitors the spectrum analyzer; I see relief in his shoulders whenever the smooth green bars stay fat.

22:47 — a call from a logging trucker on Route 17. Static claws his voice.

“Signal’s strong at the old quarry,” he says, “but fog’s creeping down the ridgeline like smoke.”

I warn him to keep headlights on low beam, thank him, cut back to Bowie.

23:12 — loud clicking in the headset. I glance at Marcus; he thumbs open the shotgun but shakes his head: interference only.

23:29 — every VU meter jumps, pegged red, though I hear no change. Marcus kills the music; the meters drop. He frowns, restarts the track. Red again. He traces the feed and discovers a phantom carrier at 19 kHz modulating the program bus — too high for human ears.

A chill runs down my spine: \*something\* is broadcasting \*into\* us.

“Kill the line to Tower Aux,” he mutters. The meters settle. For now.

At 00:02, fog swallows the building. The world outside the windows is blank.

00:15 — a staccato tapping at the basement door, like claws on steel. The Bell timer looms in my mind: 15 s threshold. If we abandon the mic more than fifteen it will fire.

Marcus gestures stay put; he descends with the shotgun. I keep the needle on a looping jazz track, but my mind counts seconds anyway.

00:18 — a thud through the floorboards.

00:20 — the music hesitates, as if the air itself absorbs the saxophone line.

00:22 — Marcus shouts through the intercom: “It’s in the crawlspace!”

He fires once. The shot rolls up the ductwork like thunder. A scream replies — metallic, layered over five octaves, as if multiple throats sing at once. The floor vibrates through my shoes.

I slam the TALK button and read weather updates, traffic bulletins, recipes—anything to keep my voice running.

00:27 — shotgun boom again. Salt rounds. A hiss like boiling tar.

00:30 — the ON AIR lamp flickers. Power dip. The jazz loop stutters.

I punch in the Bell override code but hold my finger over ENTER. If Marcus is still down there—

A growl echoes up the stairwell. Marcus bursts into view, dragging a blackened, smoking wing torn at the joint. His arm bleeds from elbow to knuckle.

“Hit it,” he rasps.

I mash ENTER.

The building shudders. A low-frequency wave collapses the silence — the Bell failsafe detonating through every speaker, the tower lattice, even the metal shelves. My teeth vibrate. Light tubes in the hall explode into snowy shards.

Through the lobby window a silhouette staggers: humanoid torso, wings like burnt sailcloth, head shifting between beak and eyeless mask. The Bell pulse does not kill it but stuns; it convulses, oil‑slick feathers ripping free, red sparks darting across its surface like veins of lightning under skin.

Marcus racks another shell. We back toward the studio where the main amps still blast Bowie at an ear‑splitting level. The creature recoils from the sound, yet claws the wall seeking silence.

I grab the vial from Adelaide, splash holy water across the threshold. It hisses on contact with the oily residue, leaving pitted scars in the linoleum. The thing retreats, screeching, and slams through the side exit, wings scraping concrete.

Silence?

No. In the monitors I see the carrier at 19 kHz still riding the master bus — stronger than before.

Marcus jams a patch cable into the reel deck, queues a 1 kHz test tone at full gain, and floods the feed with pure sine wave. The phantom carrier distorts, wavers, breaks apart like shattered glass on the analyzer.

In the sudden clarity I hear a voice:

“Operator… Twenty‑Eight… still… here…”

Evelyn’s timbre, broken and faint. Then static.

The red meters fall to normal. Bowie’s chorus returns: \*Don’t you wonder sometimes, about sound and vision…\*

We leave the transmission running until 04:00, then sign off with a brief message of calm traffic and clear skies, though the fog still gnaws at the edges of the parking lot.

\#

Dawn. The parking lot is mangled: grooves where claws raked asphalt, black feathers glued to headlights. But the Beacon still stands, humming.

Marcus patches his arm and logs the encounter.

Damage:

– south exit door destroyed,

– Bell transformer burned out (requires rewind),

– phantom carrier neutralized via sine purge.

Casualties: none.

He sketches the creature: humanoid trunk, avian arms, head fluid between bone and beak. Variant‑Λ confirmed.

I brew coffee so strong it scalds my throat. The phone rings; Adelaide’s voice quivers: “The fog has lifted, cara. I think your song kept it away.”

I don’t correct her.

Marcus and I step outside. The first sunrays strike the tower dish; frost sparkles on the cables. Salt paste streaks the doors like war paint. For a heartbeat I believe we’ve won.

Then I see it: a feather planted upright in the center of the roof, quill pierced deep into tar. A calling card. And next to it — a twisted piece of studio cable tied into a noose.

Marcus follows my gaze, jaw tight. “Round three,” he says, “starts at sunset.”

Late morning. We scrub clotted oil from the lobby floor. Marcus rewinds the charred Bell transformer with copper wire stripped from an old generator coil; his fingers bleed, but he works with furious precision.

A car door slams outside. Mr. Reeves waddles in, face flushed, clutching a boxy business phone and glossy flyers: “Great buzz in town! People say you two are heroes.”

He freezes when he sees the shredded door and salt lines. “What in God’s name—”

“Wildlife broke in,” Marcus says flatly.

“Sure,” Reeves mutters, eyes flicking to the shotgun propped by the console. He sinks his bulk into a chair that creaks in protest. “Listen, keep the drama off air. Advertisers love local color, not horror stories.”

I bite back a retort. Marcus hands him a soldering gun. “Help us fix the Bell, then.”

Reeves pales, fake smile dissolving. “I… have a meeting in town.” He drops the phone on the desk and retreats, murmuring about liability insurance.

When his car disappears down the hill Marcus snorts. “Figures. Radio’s only a cash register to him.”

\*\*

Noon light slants through broken blinds. We eat cold sandwiches over the schematic of the failsafe. Marcus points to a marginal note Evelyn scribbled years ago: \*‘Sound is sanctuary. Silence is invitation.’\*

He folds the paper, pockets it like scripture.

At 14:00 Father Vittorio arrives in his dented Fiat, trunk loaded with relics:

– A brass thurible filled with lavender and rock salt,

– Five more silver slugs,

– Two old gramophone horns modified into \*\*directional sirens\*\*.

He blesses the rebuilt transformer, then nails a cedar cross over the new plywood panel. “If the creature marks territory,” he says, “reply with a stronger mark of your own.”

Marcus installs the horns on the tower catwalk, wiring them to a separate amplifier that will play continuous pink noise should the main line fail again.

I hang a new ON AIR bulb, fresher red, almost cheerful. Almost.

\*\*

Sunset bleeds orange over the ridgeline. Fog hasn’t formed yet, but a weird stillness presses the branches flat, as though the forest itself holds its breath.

We suit up: earplugs, headsets, salt grenades (mason jars stuffed with road salt and holy water), Marcus’s shotgun, my vial of holy water refilled. The Bell transformer hums with newborn energy.

19:30 — The Beacon radiates a steady 250 watts of Bowie, then Queen. I start tonight’s show with \*“Under Pressure.”\*

Calls trickle in: fishermen at the dam, teenagers on the overlook road, Adelaide from her shop. Every voice sounds grateful, but hushed, as if they fear speaking too loud might draw shadows to their doorstep.

At 21:12 static erupts. The phantom 19 kHz carrier returns, pulsing in sync with our VU meters, but this time atop it rides a fragmented whisper: \*“Elise… Elise…”\* Then the signal cuts. Silence.

The Bell timer begins its 15‑second death march.

Marcus lunges for the deck and slams the PLAY button on a reel labeled \*TEST TONE 120 dB.\* Pink noise floods the tower horns, the studio monitors, the valley below. The timer resets.

Through the control‑room window I spot movement: shapes rushing between trees, retreating from the noise bloom.

Marcus keeps the tone running thirty seconds, then crossfades to a thumping industrial track. “Let’s make the Beacon scream tonight,” he says.

22:08 — We switch to live commentary. I read a list of phone numbers for emergency road assistance. Marcus describes the rebuilt Bell and thanks Father Vittorio by name. The priest, listening on a battery radio in town, rings the station phone to promise prayers.

22:40 — First fog tendrils snake across the parking lot. The tower light stains them crimson.

23:00 — Our spotlights catch a hunched figure at the treeline. Too tall, limbs folded wrong. It paces the perimeter, talons slicing frost.

23:14 — The figure splits: wings peel from its back, and a second, smaller silhouette tumbles free, skittering on all fours. Two now.

Marcus loads silver slug #1. I grip the salt grenade.

“Remember,” he says, voice low, “sound first, bullets second.”

At 23:30 the smaller creature sprints, impossibly fast, striking the south door. The impact warps the steel inward. The jazz loop stutters but keeps playing. Timer safe.

Second impact dents the door further. Hinges shriek.

“Open the hatch!” Marcus shouts. Together we yank the backstage trapdoor and crawl into the maintenance tunnel beneath the lobby. Soundproof rock wool muffles the broadcast above; here the music is just a ghostly thud.

The tunnel ends at a grated vent under the south steps. Through it we see talons prying the doorframe. Oil drips like ink.

Marcus signals: three, two, one— He shoves the shotgun muzzle through the grate and fires. The slug punches a fist‑sized hole in the creature’s hip. It howls, staggered.

I roll the salt grenade through the gap. Glass breaks, brine and crystals explode in a white bloom. The creature screams higher, flailing.

Above us I hear the transmitter hiccup. The ON AIR lamp flickers. Timer ticking: eight, nine—

Marcus yells “Cover!” He grabs my collar and hauls me back down the tunnel just as a winged mass smashes the steps overhead. Dust rains. The lamp dies. Timer thirteen—

I rip my phone from my pocket, open the voice memo app, and start recording. My own voice fills the mic: “ELISE LIVE, 104.6 FM, WARNING—” The phone’s speaker plays it back a split second later. Feedback squeals, but sound is sound. The timer resets.

The main power flickers back. Bowie surges through the floor again. The lamp glows red.

We crawl out the east hatch, gasping in the storage closet. Marcus slams the fuse box shut; arcs dance inside but hold.

Outside the south steps, the crippled creature drags itself away, leaving a smear of feathers and brackish fluid.

The larger Amalgamate still circles. Its gaze locks onto the tower horn emitting pink noise. In two beats it launches skyward, claws anchoring on the catwalk. The horn sparks under its grip.

Marcus yanks the Bell override lever.

A colossal pulse detonates across the catwalk, reverberating through every steel joint. The creature convulses, wings flaring wide, then slips — tumbling past the window in a silent arc before it vanishes in the fog.

We hold our breath. Ten seconds. No return.

At 00:05 I kill the test tone and switch to \*Queen – “Radio Ga Ga.”\* The Beacon sings. Fog rolls back from the lot like curtains lifting.

Marcus slumps against the wall, shoulders shaking. “Two silver slugs left,” he mutters. “I hope we won’t need them.”

But both of us know the Beacon will never truly be safe again.

04:47. Pale blue leaks over the horizon. Steam rises from the Beacon’s roof where holy‑salt residue still sizzles in bullet holes.

We survey the damage:

– South door bowed like a tin drum,

– Catwalk horn crumpled but still humming faint pink noise,

– Lobby linoleum curdled into black icicles where the grenade burst.

Yet the transmitter meter glows steady green. We are, impossibly, still on air.

Marcus re‑arms the auto‑tone failsafe, then collapses in the lobby chair. I fetch the first‑aid kit. Under gauze his arm oozes but the bleeding has slowed.

“I heard Evelyn,” I whisper while wrapping his bandage. “During the carrier break. She said ‘still here.’”

He closes his eyes. “Daniel used to say sound leaves fingerprints in the ether. Maybe she’s trapped in the anomaly’s echo.”

Outside we hear engines. A small convoy creeps up the hill: Adelaide’s van, two pickup trucks, Father Vittorio’s Fiat, and a county cruiser with lights off.

Villagers climb out: weathered men, teenagers clutching baseball bats, mothers holding thermos flasks. Adelaide approaches holding a tray of steaming cornbread.

“We had a feeling the fog came calling,” she says. She sets the tray on the hood of Marcus’s jeep and gently touches the dented south door. Her fingers come away black.

Don Vittorio murmurs prayers while shaking salt around the lot. A deputy photographs claw marks, shaking his head.

Adelaide draws me aside. “Six months ago I heard the tower go silent. That same stink of rotting feathers drifted into town.” Her eyes well. “They never found Evelyn or Daniel. But maybe now, with your noise, their souls can answer.”

She presses a folded paper into my palm: a short obituary clipping for the two lost hosts, dated one week after Fog Day.

The deputy finds a trail of oily footprints leading into the treeline but no body. At the edge of the forest, Marcus and I discover a shallow pit of disturbed soil. Inside: two intertwined gold rings, initials \*E.T.\* and \*D.R.\* engraved.

We place them in a linen pouch. Father Vittorio blesses the rings, voice cracking. Adelaide weeps softly.

A makeshift memorial forms on the transmitter deck: candles in mason jars, a Polaroid of Evelyn holding a radio mug, a cassette tape labeled \*“Night Shift 17‑04.”\*

Marcus bites his lip. “They never got a funeral.”

We hold one now. Don Vittorio recites Psalm 46. Adelaide hums an old hymn. The deputy fires a single salute from his service pistol into the fog.

When the candles gutter, Marcus and I climb to the booth. We patch in Evelyn’s cassette. Her voice, crisp and bright, fills the valley:

“You are never alone in the dark, Pinehaven — you have us.”

I lean toward the mic. “This is Elise, Operator Thirty‑One, speaking across time. We hear you, Evelyn. Thank you for standing watch.”

I let the tape run, her vintage jazz segue humming, then crossfade to modern soft piano. The sun clears the ridge.

\*\*

Over the next week the Beacon becomes a fortress:

– New steel door welded.

– Catwalk horn replaced with surplus stadium speakers.

– Backup transmitter tuned, set to auto‑loop Bowie if main line fails.

Marcus maps anomaly activity: tracks appear only under full moon or dense fog and always near silence zones. Sound truly is sanctuary.

Calls increase nightly — townsfolk volunteering weather reports, truckers reading highway mile markers, children singing lullabies down crackling lines. The valley surrounds us with noise, like hundreds of small beacons echoing ours.

On the seventh day Reeves returns, a sheepish grin and a sponsorship deal for “Harlan’s Hardware & Feed.” He stares at the silver slugs on the console and nearly faints when Marcus demonstrates a salt grenade.

Reeves signs a budget for reinforced shutters and extra diesel.

The community, once wary, now treats us like wardens of the night. Baskets of vegetables pile by the lobby door; a teenage metal band drops off homemade jingles (“Stay LOUD, Pinehaven!” screamed over distorted guitars).

\*\*But the forest remains uneasy.\*\*

Each dawn Marcus checks the roof: twice he finds small feathers arranged in concentric spirals, like sonar rings. We collect them, burn them with incense, scatter the ashes into the river.

\*\*

One afternoon I search the archive room and uncover Evelyn’s final logbook, singed at the edges. Last entry: \*“Bell fuse humming. Daniel outside checking tower. Anomaly may be learning. Must stay louder.”\*

I transcribe the note into our current log. The realization bites: the enemy adapts.

That night, while music plays, Marcus and I sit in the control room, rings of Evelyn and Daniel between us.

“If we ever fall quiet…” he begins.

“We won’t,” I answer, but my gaze drifts to the south door dent, permanently imprinted like an open wound.

He closes his fingers over mine, warm despite the scar on his knuckle. “Then we owe them a promise. Keep the Beacon lit.”

I nod. Above us the ON AIR bulb bathes our clasped hands in blood‑red light.

Week 4. The full moon rises like a scarred coin over Pinehaven. Marcus finishes his newest defense: the \*\*Siren Shield\*\* — six repurposed PA horns mounted in a ring around the tower’s midpoint, each fed by its own 300‑watt amp. When triggered they emit phase‑shifted pink noise, creating a rotating acoustic wall.

“Think of it as a lighthouse whose beam is sound, not light,” he explains. Together we calibrate delay taps so the noise sweeps the treetops every six seconds.

22:00 broadcast opens with \*“Learning to Fly”\* by Pink Floyd — our private joke. I read harvest‑market announcements; Marcus details the Siren Shield for the listeners, framing it as a ‘signal‑boost experiment.’ Truth is, we expect company.

22:47 — a cold spike rolls across the valley. The thermometer drops six degrees in a minute. Fog seeds itself from nothing, crawling uphill like a live thing.

22:59 — the phantom 19 kHz carrier slams back, stronger than ever, super‑imposed over our program. My headphones pop with static. I shout weather updates louder, but the carrier grows.

Marcus triggers the Siren Shield. Six horns roar, sweeping. The carrier flutters, then stabilizes again, doubling in amplitude. An echoing voice crackles through the studio monitors, genderless, layered:

“Silence the beacon.”

Every screen flickers. The ON AIR bulb dims to sunrise‑pink. Timer still running, but the override code unresponsive.

The studio glass clouds from within, ice crystals forming fractal feathers. On the far side of the pane a silhouette appears: Evelyn — spectral, translucent, headset still on, mouth moving in panic.

I gasp her name. The figure raises a transparent hand, pointing downward. A hiss like distant brakes bleeds through the monitors.

Marcus yells, “The crawlspace!”

We sprint to the maintenance hatch. Below, oily mist pours from every vent, condensing into amorphous masses along the corridor. Unformed anomalies — smaller, larval perhaps — squirm toward the wooden joists, gnawing at them like termites.

“They’ll collapse the tower,” Marcus shouts. He hurls a salt grenade. Explosion of brine, shrieks, retreat. Too many, though.

I rip open the PA patch bay, connect the Siren Shield directly to the main amplifier, and feed a 2 kHz sine sweep climbing to 120 dB. The horns outside scream. The floor vibrates.

The larval anomalies writhe, shriveling under the tone. Through the hatch Evelyn’s apparition flickers, then steadies, mouthing two words: \*\*“Keep rising.”\*\*

I understand: raise the frequency.

Marcus cranks the sweep upward. 3 kHz, 4 kHz, 5 kHz… Human‑pain threshold. Our ears throb even through plugs. The anomalies liquefy, dripping back into cracks.

8 kHz; glass panels in the control room fracture like spiderwebs. The Siren Shield wails atop the tower in a pitch no animal in the valley will forget.

At 9.6 kHz the phantom carrier tears — a clean break on the analyzer, like a rope sliced. The voice screaming \*Silence the beacon\* vanishes.

I kill the sweep, switch to low‑volume ambient music. The ON AIR bulb snaps back to full red. Marcus slumps against the wall, blood trickling from one ear. My head rings, but the air feels lighter, unhunted.

On an impulse I return to the booth, mic live:

“Operator Twenty‑Eight, transmission received. The beacon remains alight.”

A faint burst of static answers — almost like laughter, wistful and relieved.

\*\*

Dawn. We replace broken window panes, mop brine from the crawlspace, scrape oily residue into sealed jars for Father Vittorio to bury in sanctified ground.

Marcus logs the event:

\*Carrier neutralized via ultrasonic sweep. Apparition suggests cognitive remnant of Operator #28 persists within anomaly network. Siren Shield effective above 8 kHz but risks structural damage. Recommend sonic ladder protocol only under extreme threat.\*

We both know “extreme threat” is inevitable.

In town, word spreads about the midnight shriek. Some blame faulty PA tests; others whisper of angels fighting demons above the ridge.

Adelaide sends cinnamon rolls. Each pastry bears a tiny sugar‑glaze circle with six radial spokes — her tribute to the Siren Shield.

\*\*

That evening, before airtime, I place Evelyn and Daniel’s intertwined rings beside the fader. Marcus dims the booth lights. We share a minute’s silence — the only silence the Beacon will tolerate — in honor of voices trapped between frequencies.

At 22:00 sharp the music returns, louder than ever.

Two days of brittle sunshine follow, though fog fingers linger in the gullies like bruises that won’t heal. Marcus rebuilds the backup generator’s muffler so its drone shifts above 120 Hz — less attractive to anomalies, he claims.

He also installs a seismograph app on the control‑room tablet: apparently the Amalgamate flaps register as blips in the 3–5 Hz range. If the needle jumps again we’ll have sixty seconds’ warning.

Mr. Reeves arrives unannounced, sweating under a polyester blazer.

“You two are broadcasting weaponized sirens now?” He waves a thick folder of listener complaints about last night’s ‘sky‑scream.’

“Better annoyed than eaten,” Marcus grunts. The station owner rubs his temples, then signs the purchase order for extra glass panes and acoustic foam — muttering something about “cost of doing business.”

Minutes after Reeves leaves, two carabinieri pull up. They ask about reports of gunfire, explosions, possible black‑market fireworks. Marcus shows them the dented door, the feathers sealed in specimen bags, the clergy‑certified salt lines. The officers exchange a baffled look, jot notes, and retreat politely. No one wants to write that report.

\*\*

Late afternoon, Marcus spreads blueprints across the console. He draws a diagram: our tower as one node; Evelyn’s residual signal trapped in an echo pocket; anomalies feeding on \*negative\* space (silence) between nodes.

“Think of it like standing waves in a pipe,” he says. “The Beacon’s sound has to cancel the silence pocket or it stays resonant — that’s where Evelyn’s voice gets stuck.”

We need to create a \*\*counter‑resonance\*\*, directing all six Siren horns plus the studio monitors and tower dish into a focused beam constrained by time sync. In theory, flooding the pocket with perfectly out‑of‑phase noise could break the loop and set her free.

“Or rip the ether wide open,” I point out.

“Either way,” Marcus says, “we find out.”

We schedule the test for the next full fog bank, predicted tomorrow night. Father Vittorio volunteers to transmit continuous prayer from the church PA at the same frequency, bolstering our node network.

Adelaide bakes rye bread laced with lemon balm “for nerves.” The deputy loans us his personal rifle: “In case sound fails, use lead.”

\*\*

Test Eve, 23:30. Fog seeps under doorframes. The thermometer plunges: classic harbinger. Marcus powers up all amps, aligns horn phase to microseconds.

The control room vibrates with low‑grade hum, like we’re inside a sleeping beast’s chest cavity.

We pin a handwritten card above the fader:

\*\*Objective: Break the Pocket — Set Her Free — Remain Loud\*\*

Some of these have been in the back of my head for a long time but yeah.

This post will focus on Amelia and a new intern, Rojo. I got carried away with writing the post so I am leaving it based on Amelia and Rojo. There are three new characters I'd add, but only Rojo will be mentioned in the arc below.

Characters I'd add:  
\- Rojo (M) - Intern: A bit shy and nervous, lacks confidence but is skillful. Has a kind heart and is always willing to give more for friendships than he gets in return.   
\- Cameron (F) - Intern: Amazingly skillful, confident but quiet. Struggles to lower her walls around patients and coworkers. The other interns see as a ""loner"" who doesn't like them.   
\- Austin (M) - Attending plastics: An older man, but is a master in his field. Has specialized in burn victims and is always willing to give people the bodies they want... however, he is high maintenance and expects perfection and when people can't meet this he sees them as ""a failure""

**Amelia and Rojo:**  
So this storyline will mainly involve Amelia and Rojo. 

* Amelia and Rojo cross paths occasionally, but their first real interaction comes during a case Amelia isn't on.
* Rojo is working with another resident, but they don’t show up during an emergency. It's a late shift, and Rojo is the only one there. In a panic, he tries to help and tells the nurses to page any doctor.
* Amelia shows up, furious. The patient starts coding. She and Rojo rush him to the OR, but he dies before they get there.
* Rojo has a full-blown panic attack, blaming himself.
* Amelia calms him down and says a loss early in your career hits hard, but it’s not his fault.
* The next day, she brings Rojo onto her service to keep an eye on him.
* They work a case together, and Amelia notices he’s sharp.
* Their next patient is a woman in her 30s, formerly an addict, with an ""inoperable"" tumor.
* Amelia hesitates, saying if the woman relapses, the surgery would feel like a waste.
* Rojo disagrees. After talking to the woman, he learns she’s been sober for years.
* He advocates for her, but Amelia dismisses it with, *“I know her type.”*
* Rojo vents to the other interns in the canteen, frustrated that Amelia is judging addicts.
* Webber overhears, pulls Rojo aside, and explains Amelia is sober too, and this case hits close to home. He agrees to talk to her but asks Rojo to keep an eye on her.
* Amelia starts looking for alternative ways to help the woman. Meanwhile, Rojo’s awkward attempts to “watch over” her are hilarious—bad timing, dumb questions, coffee at midnight.
* Amelia finally snaps and demands to know what’s going on. Rojo tells her everything. She’s mad at first, then softens and opens up about her past.
* They decide to take on the case. The surgery is a success, and the woman is discharged.
* Time passes. A young girl arrives with seizures, abandoned by her parents due to a tumor.
* Amelia doesn’t want to take the case, but Rojo steps in and advocates again.
* Amelia agrees. She and Rojo operate with Beltran assisting.
* The surgery is a success. Beltran is impressed and poaches Rojo onto her service, saying he’s a natural for peds.
* Rojo doesn’t object, though he still checks in on the girl, who’s now a long-term patient. He becomes a kind of guardian to her.
* Amelia finds out and argues with Beltran over poaching Rojo. They confront him.
* Rojo, caught in the middle, says he loves neuro and goes on a rant about the brain. Beltran laughs and admits Amelia’s won but the moment sparks a romantic arc between her and Amelia.
* Rojo decides to stay in neuro but still checks in on the girl. Amelia asks Beltran to keep an eye on him when he’s on her service.
* Amelia and Rojo resume working together. They get paged to the ER and find the former addict patient readmitted.
* They take her for scans, something serious is going on but, she dies before they can save her.
* Amelia storms out, upset. Rojo is left to call TOD.
* He later checks on her. She says she’s okay, just shaken.
* Over time, Rojo notices her acting strangely. Catching her staring at meds for a long time etc.
* Worried she’s tempted to use again, he speaks to Beltran, knowing the two of them have been spending time together - Beltran says she hasn't been herself. Rojo decided to tell Webber his concerns.
* Webber talks to Amelia. She admits she wants to use but hasn’t. They go to a meeting together.
* A few days later, Amelia confronts Rojo about going to Webber and Beltran and he feels in hot water with her
* He apologises and then says that he didn't know what to do and went to the people he thought would help
* Amelia snaps back, saying he needs to grow up and should have spoken to her first. 
* She then drastically says that he's off her service, and she storms off
* Moments later, a nurse pages Amelia about a patient in a room acting strangely.
* >!She enters the room alone and finds a disheveled woman behaving erratically.!<
* >!The woman mumbles to herself while standing in the back of the room, *“She meant everything to me... You looked down on her... I was here... listening... You called her an addict... a user... You didn't even see me... no one ever sees me... You didn't even see her... You killed her…”*!<
* >!Amelia realizes that this woman knows the one they operated on and had recently passed. And that this woman is a user too. Amelia then tries to calm her down, opening up about her own sobriety and saying that she isn't judging.!<
* >!The woman snaps: *“You think you're better than me because you're sober?”*!<
* >!Before Amelia can react, the woman stabs her with a syringe of unknown drugs. She panics, apologises and runs away.!<
* >!Amelia collapses, starts to feel the high, and panics.!<
* >!Moments later, Rojo walks in not knowing what has happened, coming in saying a nurse paged him to come here. He then sees Amelia on the floor and the syringe nearby...!<

I think that, with added storylines here and there, it would be enough for one season. This is of course, just of Amelia and Rojo; the other characters will all have their own stories and arcs going on at the same time.",1,1745023344.0,greysanatomy,1,1.0,False

A few questions that some of you Oura gurus might be able to answer. 

1. If I batch add tags (I.e I track medication in another app daily, and then add them to Oura a few weeks later) will Advisor or Reports be able to look back and uncover any trends?

2. Advisor confessed that it can’t read the timestamp on tags, is there a better system to work out best/latest time to do something (caffeine, ADHD meds) without it impacting sleep. 

3 Does Oura know that beer, liquor, wine = alcohol (And draw trends from all related tags)?

4. Does it know that coffee tagged twice through the day = twice the caffeine?

I’m local here and recently built a little tool called BrewIQ that helps you time your coffee based on the weather—specifically barometric pressure.

The idea came from noticing that on certain days, coffee would make me feel more jittery or give me a headache—and I found out that pressure changes (especially here in Ontario!) actually play a role in how caffeine hits.

So I turned that into something simple: you check the app and it’ll tell you if it’s a good time to sip or maybe hold off a bit. It’s free, no sign-up, just something I made and wanted to share with the community.

Would love feedback from anyone who’s into coffee, wellness, or just weird weather patterns.

Here’s the link if you’re curious

 ## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a suitable bar towel depends on various factors, including absorbency, durability, size, and ease of maintenance. The following are some of the key features to consider when evaluating bar towels.

**Material Composition**

The material used in bar towels significantly impacts their performance and longevity. Cotton is a popular choice due to its excellent absorbency and softness. Microfiber towels, on the other hand, offer superior cleaning power and quick-drying properties. A blend of cotton and polyester can provide a balance of absorbency and durability.

**Towel Weight (GSM)**

Gsm, or grams per square meter, refers to the density of the fabric. A higher gsm typically indicates a thicker, more absorbent, and durable towel. Bar towels commonly range from 300 to 600 gsm. Towels with a higher gsm are generally better suited for heavy-duty use, while lighter towels may be more cost-effective for lighter tasks.

**Size and Dimensions**

Bar towels come in various sizes, with the most common dimensions ranging from 16x19 inches to 18x24 inches. The ideal size depends on the intended use. Smaller towels are convenient for wiping spills and cleaning glasses, while larger towels offer greater coverage for drying surfaces and handling hot plates.

**Color and Design**

The color and design of bar towels contribute to the overall aesthetic of the bar or restaurant. White towels are a classic choice for their clean and professional appearance. Colored towels can be used to differentiate between tasks or to match the establishment's d茅cor. Some towels feature stripes or patterns for added visual appeal.

**Durability and Washability**

Bar towels are subjected to frequent use and laundering, so durability is a crucial factor. Look for towels with reinforced edges and sturdy stitching to prevent fraying. The ability to withstand repeated washing without losing their shape or absorbency is essential for long-term cost-effectiveness.

**Absorbency Rate**

A high absorbency rate is vital for quickly and effectively cleaning up spills and drying surfaces. Towels made from highly absorbent materials like cotton or microfiber excel in this area. Consider the towel's ability to hold liquid without becoming saturated or leaving streaks.

 ## Core Benefits

Choosing the right bar towels can offer a multitude of benefits, impacting efficiency, hygiene, and overall cost-effectiveness.

**Improved Hygiene and Cleanliness**

High-quality bar towels are essential for maintaining a clean and sanitary environment. They effectively remove spills, dirt, and germs from surfaces, helping to prevent the spread of bacteria. Regularly washing and replacing towels ensures a hygienic environment for both staff and customers.

**Enhanced Efficiency and Productivity**

Absorbent and durable bar towels allow staff to quickly and efficiently clean up spills and maintain cleanliness. This increased efficiency translates to faster service and improved productivity. Properly sized towels can also reduce the number of trips to the laundry, saving time and effort.

**Cost Savings in the Long Run**

While cheaper towels may seem appealing initially, they often lack durability and require frequent replacement. Investing in high-quality bar towels that can withstand repeated washing and heavy use can save money in the long run. This is due to their extended lifespan and reduced need for frequent replacements.

**Protection of Surfaces and Equipment**

Bar towels provide a protective barrier between surfaces and potential spills or scratches. They can be used to cushion delicate glassware, protect countertops from heat damage, and prevent staining from spills. This helps to preserve the condition of equipment and furniture, reducing the need for costly repairs or replacements.

**Professional Appearance**

Clean, well-maintained bar towels contribute to a professional and inviting atmosphere. Presenting customers with clean glassware and tidy surfaces enhances their overall experience and reflects positively on the establishment's commitment to quality and hygiene.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about bar towels:

**What is the best material for bar towels?**

The best material depends on your specific needs. Cotton is excellent for absorbency, while microfiber offers superior cleaning power and quick-drying properties. A blend of cotton and polyester can provide a good balance of both.

**How often should bar towels be washed?**

Bar towels should be washed frequently, ideally after each shift or use. This prevents the buildup of bacteria and ensures optimal hygiene. It's also important to have an adequate supply of towels to avoid running out.

**Can bar towels be bleached?**

While bleaching can help remove stains and disinfect towels, it can also weaken the fabric and shorten their lifespan. If you choose to bleach your towels, use a diluted solution and avoid over-bleaching.

**How do I prevent bar towels from shrinking?**

To minimize shrinking, wash towels in cold or lukewarm water and avoid high heat when drying. Tumble dry on low or medium heat, or hang them to dry.

I look over and noticed she’s in my neighbors yard inside her rabbit, Bun Bun’s pen. It’s gated but doesn’t have a roof and she easily jumped inside. The rabbit is almost as big as her and she’s not that tough. I ran over there and grabbed her and scolded her, and put her inside the house. Obviously she’ll disregard my request to stay out of my neighbors yard, and I’m worried she wants to unalive the poor thing. I told my neighbor as soon as I saw her today and we both decided to keep an eye on our pets. She said she’s seen other cats in her yard and has a camera on her bunny.

1k2jvol,https://brewcheck.info,I built a tool to help time your coffee based on barometric pressure—part of my daily ritual now,"Hey everyone,

Big fan of the craft and ritual of making pour-over—it’s one of the best parts of my day. Over the last few months, I started noticing that how coffee made me feel varied wildly depending on the weather. Some days I’d feel sharp and focused, other days… jittery or weirdly sluggish.

So I started tracking barometric pressure alongside my brews and found something interesting: lower pressure days often made me more sensitive to caffeine. To make it easier to track, I built a simple tool called BrewIQ. It checks real-time pressure and gives me a quick heads-up on whether it’s a good time to brew or if I might want to wait a bit.

It hasn’t changed how I make my coffee (still using my V60), but it’s become a small part of my morning routine—like checking the weather before heading out.

Not selling anything here—just thought fellow pour-over folks might find it interesting if you’ve ever felt like your brew hits differently day to day.

If you’re curious, check it out.

Would love to hear if anyone else has noticed this, or if you’ve ever timed your coffee differently because of how you feel.",0,1745022519.0,pourover,1,0.5,False

Sometimes I drink a tea and coffee and it fricks me up kinda and i start feeling super happy super amazing top of the world singing dancing talking really fast and it kinda did sound like bipolar or hypomania except it didn't last long

I drank tea had a sugar binge apparently and just BOOM mentally my mental health was/is a bit haywire

now i feel calm right now but i'm suspecting its just like with other things where I think I am notf eeling 1 thing yet I am.

I'm not depressed (heck i have to work at it to make myself depressed)I'm typing fast but also I'm like doing stuff that looks like stimming again and i'm not sure why? Like it does help, I do it wen I feel kinda nervous or like AAAAA just really spritzed up or whatever the word it(idk that word sounds right) and i guess right now i have way too much energy cause i can do it and not stop at all whilst before i'd try and do it when not feeling energetic and i wasnt able to keep it going so i guess i just have way too much energy then? Usually working out gets it out and something that strains my muscles.

Now wondering if i have autism kinda but my social skills aren't too bad... thing is someone said it sounded like mania or hypomania but like 1. i haven felt depressed in so long 2. parents did suspect autism some mostly when i was a kid 3. people in mania generally ruin their lives unfortunately and I haven't even come close. I failed some classes cause I was too hyper to sit still and focus... I nearly kinda left home without a plan again.... like I nearly ruined my life yeah but... I didn't.

And right now I'm kinda feeling hyper occasionally really impulsive and stuff (and a bunch of other issues which im working through with a mental health doctor who never said nothin 'bout mania or anything). But someone suggested it was mania. And.. I don't think that fits right now cause I'm not even doing anything I regret and I'm still sleeping well. (note apparently you cant have stuff like paranoia if manic) BUT I still have some paranoia. And I'm sleeping well... dunno ;\_: my therapist seems to not think I have bipolar or at least hasn't said anything (also another reason is that I can manage the energy really easily without needing meds)

I think the hyper thing + paranoia just sounds like mania which is why  someone else said it was mania but lke now that i think about it why havent i ruined my life yet or even come close? Cause like I think the rest of that wanting to leave without a plan was cause I wasn't dealing with my emotions properly? Each time it happened It was right around some huge negative event in my life

Also I'm still going to classes and stuff and just chilling mostly ",0,1745022504.0,neurodiversity,0,0.5,False

Is this due to me being impatient? I've done if before with the smaller one and never had an issue.

Operator Log #31 – 21 October 2024, 23:57

104.6 FM – Pinehaven Mountain Relay

“If anyone’s listening… good evening.”

My own voice quivers in the dusty booth, startled after months of silence.

I am Elise — Operator Thirty‑One — and tonight I restart the lonely pulse of 104.6 FM.

The red ON AIR bulb glows above me like a newly awakened heart.

Every surface smells of cold metal and old coffee. Outside the window: dark pines, the violet scrap of dusk, the slow blink of the tower’s safety light bathing the treetops in blood‑red flashes.

They call this place the Beacon. Music and human voice keep the ‘acoustic anomalies’ beyond the tree line. Last April, Operators Twenty‑Eight and Twenty‑Nine — Evelyn and Daniel — vanished on Fog Day, and the transmitter died with them. No one has broadcast since. Until now.

My first words feel fragile. I shuffle a thin stack of local bulletins:

– tomorrow’s farmer’s market,

– Friday’s roadwork speech by the mayor,

– clear skies, light valley fog after midnight.

Nothing worth the dead air I’m fighting. Still, I read them in a calm tone, as if a whole valley were listening.

Beyond the glass Marcus works the control board. He is Operator Thirty‑Two: beard, sleepless eyes, an engineer’s patience. When he meets my gaze he raises a quiet thumb. Knowing he’s on the other side of the glass steadies me.

Music break. I pick an old jazz instrumental from a directory last touched in 2019, press PLAY, and exhale. The booth fills with brushed cymbals and smoky piano.

I slip into the control room. “Well?” I whisper.

Marcus lifts one earcup. “Not bad for a resurrection,” he says. The meters flicker green. He mentions the tower’s rust, the transmitter’s feeble tubes, the backup generator thrumming below our feet. I nod, but a question claws at me: \*Why did they really shut this place?\* Marcus claims “budget issues,” but his eyes dodge the truth.

There is a dark stain under the studio linoleum — someone spilled coffee long ago, he laughed earlier. It looks more like something that once tried to breathe.

An electronic hiss crackled when we first powered the console today. Within the static I caught a woman’s voice, chopped in half, begging. Marcus blamed returning frequencies. I pretended to agree.

The song ends. Back in the booth I slide the fader up.

“Welcome back to 104.6 FM,” I say, softer now, “your modest beacon on the hill. If you’re driving the switchbacks tonight, take it slow: patchy fog is expected.” I talk about the grocery lady who sold me a sandwich this afternoon, the kind smile she gave me, the worn rosary she pressed into my palm ‘for protection.’ The wooden beads lie in my pocket, cold as the night beyond the window.

Silence presses against the glass. I choose an old local rock track and let it roll.

\*\*\*

Midnight approaches. We decide to close the inaugural show.

“And that’s all for tonight,” I sign‑off, voice steady. “Sweet dreams, Pinehaven, and stay safe out there.”

Stay safe. The words taste odd. My hands tremble when the mic lamp dies.

Marcus suggests we both crash here. The mountain road is treacherous and I am bone‑tired. I agree too quickly; truth is, I don’t want to be alone.

I curl on the lobby couch, blanket up to my chin. The building groans in the wind. From the corridor Marcus checks the generator with a flashlight, then fades into dark.

That’s when the scream rips the night.

A shrill, distant cry — half owl, half human wail — slides through the cracked window. I bolt upright. Marcus reappears instantly, torchbeam shaking.

“Did you hear—” I start.

“Probably a barn owl,” he lies. His fingers drum the flashlight barrel. In the red tower glow I swear I see guilt reflected in his irises.

He seals the window. The lobby is tomb‑silent again, save for our breathing.

“Let’s sleep,” he says. “It’ll feel less scary at sunrise.”

I nod, but I clutch the rosary so hard the beads bruise my palm. A numb cold seeps from the linoleum. I count breaths, waiting for sleep or daylight — whichever arrives first.

\*\*\*

My name is Marcus, Operator Thirty‑Two, and I do not sleep.

I watch Elise from the doorway, curled under the blanket, her face soft in the emergency lamp glow. She doesn’t know I have my father’s shotgun hidden in the closet. She doesn’t know I heard that same scream the night Evelyn and Daniel disappeared.

I step outside into the brittle starlight. The wind tastes of rust and wet pine. At the tower base I smell rot — faint but present. In the grass I find a fresh oval depression, filled with dew: an Amalgamate track.

Twin red eyes flash in my beam. A shadow launches skyward with a whip of vast wings. The air bucks. I duck, heart hammering. When I dare look up, nothing but stars shimmer.

The valley lights flicker far below, unaware. I kick dirt over the track to hide it from Elise.

Inside again, shotgun loaded, I open my old field log.

01:15 – Scream (variant‑Λ)

01:20 – Perimeter patrol.

01:30 – Track under tower (fresh). Odor: sulphur/rot.

01:35 – Eye shine in spruce, launch. Probable winged Amalgamate.

No breach.

I vow she will not vanish like the others. Not on my watch.

\*\*\*

The rest of the night coughs by in static and paranoia. At 04:55 a pale dawn creeps through east windows. I erase the track outside with my boot, lock every door, and hide the shotgun before Elise wakes. She must see only safety here — at least until I have answers.

She stirs. I practice a smile.

Dawn fog hangs over Pinehaven like damp wool. Marcus insists we take his jeep to town — says the mountain road’s easier in four‑wheel drive. I agree: the steering wheel trembles under my hands after a sleepless night.

The valley looks innocent from above: tin roofs catching silver light, a single church spire poking the mist. Yet as we coast into Main Street, eyes follow us from every porch.

The grocery owner, Adelaide, waves me over. Her cardigan is buttoned wrong in her haste.

“Did you pass a calm night, ragazza?” she asks, half Italian endearment, half worried plea.

“Quiet enough,” I lie. She squeezes my arm and whispers, “Remember the rosary.” Behind her, Marcus studies the sidewalk, pretending not to hear.

We walk toward the post office. On a public notice board, a yellowed clipping traps my attention: twin black‑and‑white portraits under a headline:

\*\*SEARCH SUSPENDED — RADIO HOSTS DISAPPEAR\*\*

Evelyn Tenner, Daniel Rhodes. Their smiles stare out between thumbtacks. The article dates six months ago — Fog Day.

Ice trickles down my spine. They never told me the previous hosts were \*missing\*.

Marcus appears, face tight. “Elise, listen—”

“You knew,” I hiss, keeping my voice low. “You brought me up there knowing they vanished.”

He begs to talk in private. We duck into the shadow of the stone church. My breath fogs in the chilly air.

“Yes, I knew,” Marcus admits. His eyes glisten. “Daniel was my friend. Evelyn too. Nobody found a trace but smashed gear and… blood.”

Anger melts into dread. I clutch the rosary beads through my pocket. “So you’re here to protect the next fool who takes the mic?”

“I’m here to protect \*anyone\*,” he says. “And to find out what took them.”

We stand amid the damp bells of morning silence, and I realize I am already entangled. Leaving now would abandon Evelyn and Daniel to rumor and forgetfulness. My voice shakes but steadies at the end: “I won’t quit. Not yet.”

Relief floods his features. Somewhere in that moment we sign an unspoken contract.

A round man in a suit — Mr. Reeves, station owner — barrels down the street, all false cheer and sweaty palms.

“Splendid first broadcast!” he trumpets. “Phones lit up with nostalgia! I’ll pop by the station later with a fresh business line.”

He calls the disappearance an “incident,” pats Marcus on the back, and waddles off to the mayor’s office. I watch him go thinking: the valley keeps its ghosts politely hidden.

\#

Later, back at the Beacon, we spend the afternoon reinforcing locks, cleaning shards the size of fingernails from forgotten corners, and installing a timer that will blast music at 104 dB if silence lasts more than fifteen seconds. We nickname it the \*\*Bell failsafe\*\*.

At dusk Marcus drives to town for supplies. I stay alone, cataloging ancient CDs. The quiet hum of the air handler is almost soothing — until it isn’t.

A low, resonant moan leaks through the ventilation grate. Not the shriek of last night, but a tremor at the edge of hearing, like a cello string bowed in the basement. It rises, falls, and fades.

I press my ear to the metal vent. Cooled air brushes my cheek. Nothing now. Still, my gut twists: someone — or something — is testing our walls.

Marcus returns before full dark. I tell him about the cello‑moan. He swears and checks the basement hatch. Dust, cobwebs, stale diesel. No footprints.

He sets the shotgun within reach behind a stack of old reel‑to‑reel tapes.

“We’ll take shifts tonight,” he says. I don’t argue.

\#

\*\*Second Night Broadcast\*\*

The clock hits 22:00. On Air lamp flicks red. I breathe.

“Good evening, Pinehaven. Operator Thirty‑One keeping you company. Clear skies tonight, though fog may creep in after two.”

A caller surprises me — crackling landline, elderly voice: “Miss Elise, bless the Beacon for lighting up again.”

I thank her. The line goes dead with a soft click and the silence feels heavier than any scream.

Between songs I read a poem Evelyn once recited on a surviving tape: \*‘Even darkness owns its music.’\* My throat tightens on the last line.

At midnight I hand off the mic to Marcus for equipment talk. His voice is steady, softer than his stance. Outside the booth window I think I see shapes shifting among the pines, but the tower light reveals nothing.

We end the show at 00:30. Timer armed. Doors barred. The Beacon hums through the small hours.

At 03:17 the moan returns, louder. It vibrates the floorboards. Somewhere downstairs glass shatters.

Marcus grabs the shotgun; I clutch a jar of consecrated salt Adelaide pressed on me ‘just in case.’

We descend the stairwell, flashlights slicing dust. A basement window lies smashed inward, glittering shards on the concrete. Moonlight reveals something darker: a smear of oily residue leading to the generator room.

We follow, hearts pounding. The residue pools beneath the fuel tank, but the metal is intact. In the corner sits an object — a single feather, glossy black, longer than my forearm. Its quill end drips the same oil.

I feel the room tilt, as if gravity points toward the feather.

“Winged Amalgamate,” Marcus mutters. He stuffs the feather into a fireproof bag. “It’s marking territory.”

The fuel gauge reads full. The Beacon still purrs. The thing hasn’t come for the power — yet.

We sweep the perimeter, patch the window with plywood, and wait for dawn.

Morning, 08:12.

We drive into town to buy plywood, sheet metal, extra fuses. Adelaide greets us with two thermos flasks of chicory coffee and a silent look that says \*I heard it too.\* She doesn’t ask for details; she simply slips a small vial of holy water into my coat pocket.

At the church we find Father Vittorio polishing the brass thurible. Marcus presents the feather. The priest’s face drains of color.

“I buried one like this after the \*Great Lull\* of ’89,” he whispers. He blesses a pouch of rock salt, adds three silver slugs from an old reliquary, and warns us not to let the Beacon fall quiet. “Sound is your shield,” he repeats, tapping his temple.

We reinforce every vent with wire mesh, bolt the plywood over the basement window, smear salt paste along sill edges and door thresholds. Marcus reroutes a second speaker line directly to the tower so the Bell failsafe will pulse through the steel lattice if triggered.

As the sun sets we test the system: cut the main audio bus. Exactly fifteen seconds later the Bell fires — a sub‑audible boom felt in the sternum rather than heard. Good.

\#

\*\*Third Night Broadcast\*\*

A pale crescent moon floats above the treetops. The forest looks carved from gunmetal.

I open with David Bowie’s \*“Sound and Vision.”\* Marcus monitors the spectrum analyzer; I see relief in his shoulders whenever the smooth green bars stay fat.

22:47 — a call from a logging trucker on Route 17. Static claws his voice.

“Signal’s strong at the old quarry,” he says, “but fog’s creeping down the ridgeline like smoke.”

I warn him to keep headlights on low beam, thank him, cut back to Bowie.

23:12 — loud clicking in the headset. I glance at Marcus; he thumbs open the shotgun but shakes his head: interference only.

23:29 — every VU meter jumps, pegged red, though I hear no change. Marcus kills the music; the meters drop. He frowns, restarts the track. Red again. He traces the feed and discovers a phantom carrier at 19 kHz modulating the program bus — too high for human ears.

A chill runs down my spine: \*something\* is broadcasting \*into\* us.

“Kill the line to Tower Aux,” he mutters. The meters settle. For now.

At 00:02, fog swallows the building. The world outside the windows is blank.

00:15 — a staccato tapping at the basement door, like claws on steel. The Bell timer looms in my mind: 15 s threshold. If we abandon the mic more than fifteen it will fire.

Marcus gestures stay put; he descends with the shotgun. I keep the needle on a looping jazz track, but my mind counts seconds anyway.

00:18 — a thud through the floorboards.

00:20 — the music hesitates, as if the air itself absorbs the saxophone line.

00:22 — Marcus shouts through the intercom: “It’s in the crawlspace!”

He fires once. The shot rolls up the ductwork like thunder. A scream replies — metallic, layered over five octaves, as if multiple throats sing at once. The floor vibrates through my shoes.

I slam the TALK button and read weather updates, traffic bulletins, recipes—anything to keep my voice running.

00:27 — shotgun boom again. Salt rounds. A hiss like boiling tar.

00:30 — the ON AIR lamp flickers. Power dip. The jazz loop stutters.

I punch in the Bell override code but hold my finger over ENTER. If Marcus is still down there—

A growl echoes up the stairwell. Marcus bursts into view, dragging a blackened, smoking wing torn at the joint. His arm bleeds from elbow to knuckle.

“Hit it,” he rasps.

I mash ENTER.

The building shudders. A low-frequency wave collapses the silence — the Bell failsafe detonating through every speaker, the tower lattice, even the metal shelves. My teeth vibrate. Light tubes in the hall explode into snowy shards.

Through the lobby window a silhouette staggers: humanoid torso, wings like burnt sailcloth, head shifting between beak and eyeless mask. The Bell pulse does not kill it but stuns; it convulses, oil‑slick feathers ripping free, red sparks darting across its surface like veins of lightning under skin.

Marcus racks another shell. We back toward the studio where the main amps still blast Bowie at an ear‑splitting level. The creature recoils from the sound, yet claws the wall seeking silence.

I grab the vial from Adelaide, splash holy water across the threshold. It hisses on contact with the oily residue, leaving pitted scars in the linoleum. The thing retreats, screeching, and slams through the side exit, wings scraping concrete.

Silence?

No. In the monitors I see the carrier at 19 kHz still riding the master bus — stronger than before.

Marcus jams a patch cable into the reel deck, queues a 1 kHz test tone at full gain, and floods the feed with pure sine wave. The phantom carrier distorts, wavers, breaks apart like shattered glass on the analyzer.

In the sudden clarity I hear a voice:

“Operator… Twenty‑Eight… still… here…”

Evelyn’s timbre, broken and faint. Then static.

The red meters fall to normal. Bowie’s chorus returns: \*Don’t you wonder sometimes, about sound and vision…\*

We leave the transmission running until 04:00, then sign off with a brief message of calm traffic and clear skies, though the fog still gnaws at the edges of the parking lot.

\#

Dawn. The parking lot is mangled: grooves where claws raked asphalt, black feathers glued to headlights. But the Beacon still stands, humming.

Marcus patches his arm and logs the encounter.

Damage:

– south exit door destroyed,

– Bell transformer burned out (requires rewind),

– phantom carrier neutralized via sine purge.

Casualties: none.

He sketches the creature: humanoid trunk, avian arms, head fluid between bone and beak. Variant‑Λ confirmed.

I brew coffee so strong it scalds my throat. The phone rings; Adelaide’s voice quivers: “The fog has lifted, cara. I think your song kept it away.”

I don’t correct her.

Marcus and I step outside. The first sunrays strike the tower dish; frost sparkles on the cables. Salt paste streaks the doors like war paint. For a heartbeat I believe we’ve won.

Then I see it: a feather planted upright in the center of the roof, quill pierced deep into tar. A calling card. And next to it — a twisted piece of studio cable tied into a noose.

Marcus follows my gaze, jaw tight. “Round three,” he says, “starts at sunset.”

Late morning. We scrub clotted oil from the lobby floor. Marcus rewinds the charred Bell transformer with copper wire stripped from an old generator coil; his fingers bleed, but he works with furious precision.

A car door slams outside. Mr. Reeves waddles in, face flushed, clutching a boxy business phone and glossy flyers: “Great buzz in town! People say you two are heroes.”

He freezes when he sees the shredded door and salt lines. “What in God’s name—”

“Wildlife broke in,” Marcus says flatly.

“Sure,” Reeves mutters, eyes flicking to the shotgun propped by the console. He sinks his bulk into a chair that creaks in protest. “Listen, keep the drama off air. Advertisers love local color, not horror stories.”

I bite back a retort. Marcus hands him a soldering gun. “Help us fix the Bell, then.”

Reeves pales, fake smile dissolving. “I… have a meeting in town.” He drops the phone on the desk and retreats, murmuring about liability insurance.

When his car disappears down the hill Marcus snorts. “Figures. Radio’s only a cash register to him.”

\*\*

Noon light slants through broken blinds. We eat cold sandwiches over the schematic of the failsafe. Marcus points to a marginal note Evelyn scribbled years ago: \*‘Sound is sanctuary. Silence is invitation.’\*

He folds the paper, pockets it like scripture.

At 14:00 Father Vittorio arrives in his dented Fiat, trunk loaded with relics:

– A brass thurible filled with lavender and rock salt,

– Five more silver slugs,

– Two old gramophone horns modified into \*\*directional sirens\*\*.

He blesses the rebuilt transformer, then nails a cedar cross over the new plywood panel. “If the creature marks territory,” he says, “reply with a stronger mark of your own.”

Marcus installs the horns on the tower catwalk, wiring them to a separate amplifier that will play continuous pink noise should the main line fail again.

I hang a new ON AIR bulb, fresher red, almost cheerful. Almost.

\*\*

Sunset bleeds orange over the ridgeline. Fog hasn’t formed yet, but a weird stillness presses the branches flat, as though the forest itself holds its breath.

We suit up: earplugs, headsets, salt grenades (mason jars stuffed with road salt and holy water), Marcus’s shotgun, my vial of holy water refilled. The Bell transformer hums with newborn energy.

19:30 — The Beacon radiates a steady 250 watts of Bowie, then Queen. I start tonight’s show with \*“Under Pressure.”\*

Calls trickle in: fishermen at the dam, teenagers on the overlook road, Adelaide from her shop. Every voice sounds grateful, but hushed, as if they fear speaking too loud might draw shadows to their doorstep.

At 21:12 static erupts. The phantom 19 kHz carrier returns, pulsing in sync with our VU meters, but this time atop it rides a fragmented whisper: \*“Elise… Elise…”\* Then the signal cuts. Silence.

The Bell timer begins its 15‑second death march.

Marcus lunges for the deck and slams the PLAY button on a reel labeled \*TEST TONE 120 dB.\* Pink noise floods the tower horns, the studio monitors, the valley below. The timer resets.

Through the control‑room window I spot movement: shapes rushing between trees, retreating from the noise bloom.

Marcus keeps the tone running thirty seconds, then crossfades to a thumping industrial track. “Let’s make the Beacon scream tonight,” he says.

22:08 — We switch to live commentary. I read a list of phone numbers for emergency road assistance. Marcus describes the rebuilt Bell and thanks Father Vittorio by name. The priest, listening on a battery radio in town, rings the station phone to promise prayers.

22:40 — First fog tendrils snake across the parking lot. The tower light stains them crimson.

23:00 — Our spotlights catch a hunched figure at the treeline. Too tall, limbs folded wrong. It paces the perimeter, talons slicing frost.

23:14 — The figure splits: wings peel from its back, and a second, smaller silhouette tumbles free, skittering on all fours. Two now.

Marcus loads silver slug #1. I grip the salt grenade.

“Remember,” he says, voice low, “sound first, bullets second.”

At 23:30 the smaller creature sprints, impossibly fast, striking the south door. The impact warps the steel inward. The jazz loop stutters but keeps playing. Timer safe.

Second impact dents the door further. Hinges shriek.

“Open the hatch!” Marcus shouts. Together we yank the backstage trapdoor and crawl into the maintenance tunnel beneath the lobby. Soundproof rock wool muffles the broadcast above; here the music is just a ghostly thud.

The tunnel ends at a grated vent under the south steps. Through it we see talons prying the doorframe. Oil drips like ink.

Marcus signals: three, two, one— He shoves the shotgun muzzle through the grate and fires. The slug punches a fist‑sized hole in the creature’s hip. It howls, staggered.

I roll the salt grenade through the gap. Glass breaks, brine and crystals explode in a white bloom. The creature screams higher, flailing.

Above us I hear the transmitter hiccup. The ON AIR lamp flickers. Timer ticking: eight, nine—

Marcus yells “Cover!” He grabs my collar and hauls me back down the tunnel just as a winged mass smashes the steps overhead. Dust rains. The lamp dies. Timer thirteen—

I rip my phone from my pocket, open the voice memo app, and start recording. My own voice fills the mic: “ELISE LIVE, 104.6 FM, WARNING—” The phone’s speaker plays it back a split second later. Feedback squeals, but sound is sound. The timer resets.

The main power flickers back. Bowie surges through the floor again. The lamp glows red.

We crawl out the east hatch, gasping in the storage closet. Marcus slams the fuse box shut; arcs dance inside but hold.

Outside the south steps, the crippled creature drags itself away, leaving a smear of feathers and brackish fluid.

The larger Amalgamate still circles. Its gaze locks onto the tower horn emitting pink noise. In two beats it launches skyward, claws anchoring on the catwalk. The horn sparks under its grip.

Marcus yanks the Bell override lever.

A colossal pulse detonates across the catwalk, reverberating through every steel joint. The creature convulses, wings flaring wide, then slips — tumbling past the window in a silent arc before it vanishes in the fog.

We hold our breath. Ten seconds. No return.

At 00:05 I kill the test tone and switch to \*Queen – “Radio Ga Ga.”\* The Beacon sings. Fog rolls back from the lot like curtains lifting.

Marcus slumps against the wall, shoulders shaking. “Two silver slugs left,” he mutters. “I hope we won’t need them.”

But both of us know the Beacon will never truly be safe again.

04:47. Pale blue leaks over the horizon. Steam rises from the Beacon’s roof where holy‑salt residue still sizzles in bullet holes.

We survey the damage:

– South door bowed like a tin drum,

– Catwalk horn crumpled but still humming faint pink noise,

– Lobby linoleum curdled into black icicles where the grenade burst.

Yet the transmitter meter glows steady green. We are, impossibly, still on air.

Marcus re‑arms the auto‑tone failsafe, then collapses in the lobby chair. I fetch the first‑aid kit. Under gauze his arm oozes but the bleeding has slowed.

“I heard Evelyn,” I whisper while wrapping his bandage. “During the carrier break. She said ‘still here.’”

He closes his eyes. “Daniel used to say sound leaves fingerprints in the ether. Maybe she’s trapped in the anomaly’s echo.”

Outside we hear engines. A small convoy creeps up the hill: Adelaide’s van, two pickup trucks, Father Vittorio’s Fiat, and a county cruiser with lights off.

Villagers climb out: weathered men, teenagers clutching baseball bats, mothers holding thermos flasks. Adelaide approaches holding a tray of steaming cornbread.

“We had a feeling the fog came calling,” she says. She sets the tray on the hood of Marcus’s jeep and gently touches the dented south door. Her fingers come away black.

Don Vittorio murmurs prayers while shaking salt around the lot. A deputy photographs claw marks, shaking his head.

Adelaide draws me aside. “Six months ago I heard the tower go silent. That same stink of rotting feathers drifted into town.” Her eyes well. “They never found Evelyn or Daniel. But maybe now, with your noise, their souls can answer.”

She presses a folded paper into my palm: a short obituary clipping for the two lost hosts, dated one week after Fog Day.

The deputy finds a trail of oily footprints leading into the treeline but no body. At the edge of the forest, Marcus and I discover a shallow pit of disturbed soil. Inside: two intertwined gold rings, initials \*E.T.\* and \*D.R.\* engraved.

We place them in a linen pouch. Father Vittorio blesses the rings, voice cracking. Adelaide weeps softly.

A makeshift memorial forms on the transmitter deck: candles in mason jars, a Polaroid of Evelyn holding a radio mug, a cassette tape labeled \*“Night Shift 17‑04.”\*

Marcus bites his lip. “They never got a funeral.”

We hold one now. Don Vittorio recites Psalm 46. Adelaide hums an old hymn. The deputy fires a single salute from his service pistol into the fog.

When the candles gutter, Marcus and I climb to the booth. We patch in Evelyn’s cassette. Her voice, crisp and bright, fills the valley:

“You are never alone in the dark, Pinehaven — you have us.”

I lean toward the mic. “This is Elise, Operator Thirty‑One, speaking across time. We hear you, Evelyn. Thank you for standing watch.”

I let the tape run, her vintage jazz segue humming, then crossfade to modern soft piano. The sun clears the ridge.

\*\*

Over the next week the Beacon becomes a fortress:

– New steel door welded.

– Catwalk horn replaced with surplus stadium speakers.

– Backup transmitter tuned, set to auto‑loop Bowie if main line fails.

Marcus maps anomaly activity: tracks appear only under full moon or dense fog and always near silence zones. Sound truly is sanctuary.

Calls increase nightly — townsfolk volunteering weather reports, truckers reading highway mile markers, children singing lullabies down crackling lines. The valley surrounds us with noise, like hundreds of small beacons echoing ours.

On the seventh day Reeves returns, a sheepish grin and a sponsorship deal for “Harlan’s Hardware & Feed.” He stares at the silver slugs on the console and nearly faints when Marcus demonstrates a salt grenade.

Reeves signs a budget for reinforced shutters and extra diesel.

The community, once wary, now treats us like wardens of the night. Baskets of vegetables pile by the lobby door; a teenage metal band drops off homemade jingles (“Stay LOUD, Pinehaven!” screamed over distorted guitars).

\*\*But the forest remains uneasy.\*\*

Each dawn Marcus checks the roof: twice he finds small feathers arranged in concentric spirals, like sonar rings. We collect them, burn them with incense, scatter the ashes into the river.

\*\*

One afternoon I search the archive room and uncover Evelyn’s final logbook, singed at the edges. Last entry: \*“Bell fuse humming. Daniel outside checking tower. Anomaly may be learning. Must stay louder.”\*

I transcribe the note into our current log. The realization bites: the enemy adapts.

That night, while music plays, Marcus and I sit in the control room, rings of Evelyn and Daniel between us.

“If we ever fall quiet…” he begins.

“We won’t,” I answer, but my gaze drifts to the south door dent, permanently imprinted like an open wound.

He closes his fingers over mine, warm despite the scar on his knuckle. “Then we owe them a promise. Keep the Beacon lit.”

I nod. Above us the ON AIR bulb bathes our clasped hands in blood‑red light.

Week 4. The full moon rises like a scarred coin over Pinehaven. Marcus finishes his newest defense: the \*\*Siren Shield\*\* — six repurposed PA horns mounted in a ring around the tower’s midpoint, each fed by its own 300‑watt amp. When triggered they emit phase‑shifted pink noise, creating a rotating acoustic wall.

“Think of it as a lighthouse whose beam is sound, not light,” he explains. Together we calibrate delay taps so the noise sweeps the treetops every six seconds.

22:00 broadcast opens with \*“Learning to Fly”\* by Pink Floyd — our private joke. I read harvest‑market announcements; Marcus details the Siren Shield for the listeners, framing it as a ‘signal‑boost experiment.’ Truth is, we expect company.

22:47 — a cold spike rolls across the valley. The thermometer drops six degrees in a minute. Fog seeds itself from nothing, crawling uphill like a live thing.

22:59 — the phantom 19 kHz carrier slams back, stronger than ever, super‑imposed over our program. My headphones pop with static. I shout weather updates louder, but the carrier grows.

Marcus triggers the Siren Shield. Six horns roar, sweeping. The carrier flutters, then stabilizes again, doubling in amplitude. An echoing voice crackles through the studio monitors, genderless, layered:

“Silence the beacon.”

Every screen flickers. The ON AIR bulb dims to sunrise‑pink. Timer still running, but the override code unresponsive.

The studio glass clouds from within, ice crystals forming fractal feathers. On the far side of the pane a silhouette appears: Evelyn — spectral, translucent, headset still on, mouth moving in panic.

I gasp her name. The figure raises a transparent hand, pointing downward. A hiss like distant brakes bleeds through the monitors.

Marcus yells, “The crawlspace!”

We sprint to the maintenance hatch. Below, oily mist pours from every vent, condensing into amorphous masses along the corridor. Unformed anomalies — smaller, larval perhaps — squirm toward the wooden joists, gnawing at them like termites.

“They’ll collapse the tower,” Marcus shouts. He hurls a salt grenade. Explosion of brine, shrieks, retreat. Too many, though.

I rip open the PA patch bay, connect the Siren Shield directly to the main amplifier, and feed a 2 kHz sine sweep climbing to 120 dB. The horns outside scream. The floor vibrates.

The larval anomalies writhe, shriveling under the tone. Through the hatch Evelyn’s apparition flickers, then steadies, mouthing two words: \*\*“Keep rising.”\*\*

I understand: raise the frequency.

Marcus cranks the sweep upward. 3 kHz, 4 kHz, 5 kHz… Human‑pain threshold. Our ears throb even through plugs. The anomalies liquefy, dripping back into cracks.

8 kHz; glass panels in the control room fracture like spiderwebs. The Siren Shield wails atop the tower in a pitch no animal in the valley will forget.

At 9.6 kHz the phantom carrier tears — a clean break on the analyzer, like a rope sliced. The voice screaming \*Silence the beacon\* vanishes.

I kill the sweep, switch to low‑volume ambient music. The ON AIR bulb snaps back to full red. Marcus slumps against the wall, blood trickling from one ear. My head rings, but the air feels lighter, unhunted.

On an impulse I return to the booth, mic live:

“Operator Twenty‑Eight, transmission received. The beacon remains alight.”

A faint burst of static answers — almost like laughter, wistful and relieved.

\*\*

Dawn. We replace broken window panes, mop brine from the crawlspace, scrape oily residue into sealed jars for Father Vittorio to bury in sanctified ground.

Marcus logs the event:

\*Carrier neutralized via ultrasonic sweep. Apparition suggests cognitive remnant of Operator #28 persists within anomaly network. Siren Shield effective above 8 kHz but risks structural damage. Recommend sonic ladder protocol only under extreme threat.\*

We both know “extreme threat” is inevitable.

In town, word spreads about the midnight shriek. Some blame faulty PA tests; others whisper of angels fighting demons above the ridge.

Adelaide sends cinnamon rolls. Each pastry bears a tiny sugar‑glaze circle with six radial spokes — her tribute to the Siren Shield.

\*\*

That evening, before airtime, I place Evelyn and Daniel’s intertwined rings beside the fader. Marcus dims the booth lights. We share a minute’s silence — the only silence the Beacon will tolerate — in honor of voices trapped between frequencies.

At 22:00 sharp the music returns, louder than ever.

Two days of brittle sunshine follow, though fog fingers linger in the gullies like bruises that won’t heal. Marcus rebuilds the backup generator’s muffler so its drone shifts above 120 Hz — less attractive to anomalies, he claims.

He also installs a seismograph app on the control‑room tablet: apparently the Amalgamate flaps register as blips in the 3–5 Hz range. If the needle jumps again we’ll have sixty seconds’ warning.

Mr. Reeves arrives unannounced, sweating under a polyester blazer.

“You two are broadcasting weaponized sirens now?” He waves a thick folder of listener complaints about last night’s ‘sky‑scream.’

“Better annoyed than eaten,” Marcus grunts. The station owner rubs his temples, then signs the purchase order for extra glass panes and acoustic foam — muttering something about “cost of doing business.”

Minutes after Reeves leaves, two carabinieri pull up. They ask about reports of gunfire, explosions, possible black‑market fireworks. Marcus shows them the dented door, the feathers sealed in specimen bags, the clergy‑certified salt lines. The officers exchange a baffled look, jot notes, and retreat politely. No one wants to write that report.

\*\*

Late afternoon, Marcus spreads blueprints across the console. He draws a diagram: our tower as one node; Evelyn’s residual signal trapped in an echo pocket; anomalies feeding on \*negative\* space (silence) between nodes.

“Think of it like standing waves in a pipe,” he says. “The Beacon’s sound has to cancel the silence pocket or it stays resonant — that’s where Evelyn’s voice gets stuck.”

We need to create a \*\*counter‑resonance\*\*, directing all six Siren horns plus the studio monitors and tower dish into a focused beam constrained by time sync. In theory, flooding the pocket with perfectly out‑of‑phase noise could break the loop and set her free.

“Or rip the ether wide open,” I point out.

“Either way,” Marcus says, “we find out.”

We schedule the test for the next full fog bank, predicted tomorrow night. Father Vittorio volunteers to transmit continuous prayer from the church PA at the same frequency, bolstering our node network.

Adelaide bakes rye bread laced with lemon balm “for nerves.” The deputy loans us his personal rifle: “In case sound fails, use lead.”

\*\*

Test Eve, 23:30. Fog seeps under doorframes. The thermometer plunges: classic harbinger. Marcus powers up all amps, aligns horn phase to microseconds.

The control room vibrates with low‑grade hum, like we’re inside a sleeping beast’s chest cavity.

We pin a handwritten card above the fader:

\*\*Objective: Break the Pocket — Set Her Free — Remain Loud\*\*

1k2js0l,https://brewcheck.info,I built BrewIQ – a tool that uses barometric pressure to help you optimize your caffeine timing,"Hey QS community,

I’ve been experimenting with how atmospheric pressure impacts my energy levels, especially in relation to caffeine timing. I noticed that on days with lower pressure, my usual cup of coffee would hit differently—more jitters, less clarity, and sometimes even headaches.

So I built a simple tool called BrewIQ. It pulls in real-time barometric pressure and weather data to suggest whether it’s a good time to consume caffeine or if you might want to hold off. The idea is to better align your coffee intake with environmental conditions to avoid crashes and enhance focus.

It’s still early, but I’m hoping it can become part of a daily self-regulation toolkit—especially for those tracking sleep, HRV, or mood alongside caffeine intake.

Would love your feedback:
	•	Anyone else track pressure and caffeine response?
	•	What integrations (e.g. Apple Health, Oura, Garmin) would make this more useful?
	•	What metrics do you wish a tool like this tracked?

Beginning woodworker looking for some advice on how to finish this piece of mappa burl that I am making for a coffee table. I have so far sealed it with epoxy to fill gaps and burl pits. Then some CA glue and wax sticks to fill micro pits. I sanded it down and got to the point where I sprayed on the finish I originally wanted to go with, which was the general finisher water based poly satin. I wanted less yellowing on the finish and to keep a lot of the natural color. The first image is with the first coat of the finish. The problem is it didn't even get slightly darker. I thought it would look similar to when it is just sprayed with a bit of water, which looks perfect in my opinion, but it didn't even do that. So I am not getting the curls that are much more noticeable in the second picture which is when the epoxy was poured on. It is a little darker than I was looking for with the epoxy. Once sanded it got a lot lighter.

Does anyone have any advice on how to get a slightly more yellowing finish so I can get more credit for the curls that isn't quite as dark as the epoxy? I am debating just pouring on a little more epoxy and keeping the sanding to a minimum to keep most of the color, but would love some other ideas.

  
I have for the most part been following the video from Blacktail Studio on this project. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWs47qR3XOs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWs47qR3XOs)

In the video, he also adds a coat of Rubio Monocoat after applying a poly finish, which he mentions is a bit weird for this type of project. I would also love any opinions on if that's a good idea or if I should just use some other wax.",1,1745022121.0,woodworking,0,1.0,False

Dear Agent,

I am excited to share my 84,000-word fantasy novel, URBAN WITCH. Picture The Dresden Files meets Veronica Mars in a world where magic is as natural as your morning cup of coffee. URBAN WITCH blends the dark, character-driven rebellion of Kirsti Ciccarelli’s Heartless Hunter with the morally complex world and simmering guilt of Hafsah Faizal’s A Tempest of Tea. 

Morgan Burke can raise the dead. That should make him a legendary detective—instead, it makes him a pariah. Necromancy may not be illegal, but history remembers the worst of them, and Morgan has been feared and shunned his entire life. So when a string of brutal murders leaves police baffled, he’s handed his first solo case. It’s his shot at legitimacy in a precinct that barely tolerates him. The murders seem designed to provoke his most dangerous ability—one that chips away at his humanity the more he wields it. 

Marie Vélez hunts predators the law won’t touch—but only with a sliver of her overwhelming magic. She never uses more and never loses control, because the last time she did, someone died. She’s lived with that guilt ever since. But when the killer targets her best friend, Marie realizes her restraint could be the very thing that gets them both killed. Even if using her power means reliving the past she’s tried so hard to forget, she won’t stand down again. 

As the body count rises, Morgan and Marie uncover something far worse than a lone killer. The murderer is only a puppet—and someone with far more power is guiding his hand. To stop them, Morgan must risk the dark magic that threatens to swallow his soul, while Marie must control the power she’s spent years suppressing. But as their bond deepens into something neither expected, trust becomes a dangerous thing. And in a fight for their lives, falling for each other might be the one risk that costs them everything. 

(Personalization)

Always check the product label for specific ingredient information.

**What are some creative ways to use Baileys Irish Cream besides drinking it straight?**
    Baileys Irish Cream is a versatile ingredient that can be used in various creative ways. It can be added to coffee, hot chocolate, or milkshakes for a creamy and indulgent twist.

For instance I like opera and musicals. I don’t like people knowing that. That’s private. 

I like biker movies, sports,  video games, shooting games  and war movies. Rock ‘n’ roll roll. Hard rock, heavy metal. Going to the gym. I’d smoke a cigar, but I don’t wanna get lung issues. Same with beer. But I definitely would go to a bar and play pool. It Seems that most men the don’t seem to do that to that extent. And it’s usually a combination of other men with different interest not just one guy. 



I also noticed some Cis guy friends I hang around with. Act the masculine way but they don’t overly do it to the point where they’re always acting like that.

There’s this one guy that likes a genre of romantic action movies and loves to eat cheesecake and eat blueberry pies.  I like black coffee 

but really like star bucks Frappuccino. 

Shh he can’t know that. 

I thought to myself well don’t you like sports and they don’t and they’re straight. Do you think that me acting that way can hinder my passing because I’m doing it to the extreme?


Note: I pass and im on testosterone and 5 years already.

2. I am trying to grow taller and need help formulating a plan and diet that would help me do this. Specifically, I want to know if cooked meat or raw meat will be better for my plan. I do know both have their drawbacks and advantages like for example cooked meat having more iron and zinc while raw meat has more water soluble vitamins. The problem is that I don't want to go through a detox right now in this crucial growing period (17.5 years old male) so helping recommend which meat to choose would be really nice. 

3.  I know that milk is a very important thing to add to your diet to grow, but honestly is there a real big difference between raw and pasteurized/cooked milk here? I know there are a lot of benefits to raw milk, so I would be willing to go for it? Also which milk from which animal would be the best for height growth?

4. What does a diet on this sub usually consist of? What plants and other foods (eggs) should I specifically  be consuming to grow as tall as possible? What foods are good what foods are bad? Should I actually be drinking blood optimally no water, or is reserve osmosis filtered water with added top notch salt fine? What is the most optimal diet for height growth (If you guys could help me plan this)?

5. What should I be doing outside of my diet to increase height such as sleep, masturbation, and exercise? I have heard the YouTuber Goatis say exercise stunts growth because it puts unnecessary stress on the body, and that all exercise is just bad and decreases lifespan because it is unnecessary stress that your body doesn't' want. Like what should I do, try to lie around all day as much as possible?

6. Do supplements actually work? I have heard youTubers such as Goatis say that supplements are never absorbed and just bind to your kidneys and calcify or something. Is this true?

I started getting back into the dating world after about 6 months of being single (so I have been ""dating"" for a year), and I have forgotten just how bad I am at this. I met my wife through work so things naturally progressed and by the time I asked her out on a date we already knew each other and flirting/romance happened quickly.

Since I've been single I have only been on a few dates. I'm picky. The last one I thought went really well but when the woman turned me down for a second because she couldn't see a romantic connection, I thought about it and went, ya she is totally right. I usually suggest a drink for the first date just because I like something simple to get to know them and see if there's good banter. If I'm still interested and attracted, I see romance as something that builds up over the subsequebt dates. For this date we went out for coffee (she doesn't drink) and it was an afternoon date (it was what worked with our schedules) and I find it hard to build romance in that scenario. But like I said, I think I'm honestly just bad at this. I went over how the date went in hindsight and can totally appreciate why she didn't feel a romantic connection.

my usual breakfast is Greek yogurt with chia seeds mixed in, a protein shake, and 6oz raspberries

lunch is usually a chicken caesar, I shred my own parmesan for it. sometimes I have an apple or some almonds, pistachio, or macadamia nuts (i use a food scale to measure 1oz), too.

dinner is a toss up, I usually have a meat and some type of veggie, generally broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, or a mix of peppers and mushrooms. I do on occasion have rice or pasta. 

when I workout, 3x a week lifting, I have a rice krispy bar (small ones) for the carb energy boost. I have 5g of creatine post lift.

I am also a sucker for a sweet treat (my preferred is a date stuffed with pb and a few dark chocolate chips or an unreal mini coconut bar) and my favorite weekend breakfast is a protein pancake bowl (protein powder, Kodiak cake mix, eggs, & milk)
I drink water, black coffee, varied hot teas (i add stevia when needed) and i like any/all diet sodas. except for the protein shake I dont typically drink my calories. 

generally trying to lose weight but also better my health. im a 5ft woman in her early 30s. no kids so I dont have any post partum issues. I struggle mostly with portion sizes. I am in the 130s, ideally I'd like to lose about 15 - 20lbs. I'd prefer to be able to achieve this in about 6 months if that's possible. 

im open to most ideas regarding meal prep, I have a very unpredictable career field so prep is a MUST for me. I also dont mind eating the same thing, my above outline has been what I've been doing for a few months, and it isnt working so I figured I needed to re evaluate. 

budget is fairly average, I shop for two people, my partner eats however he likes and it doesnt bother me.  $150 is about avg for us weekly, and i do have a Costco membership. if we eat 21 meals a week, I make probably 19 of those, I dont eat out but maybe one or two times a week, and its usually for some buffalo wings or a bowl from Chipotle.

# The Culprit: Bad Posture

I work a desk job and never paid much attention to my sitting position. Over time, I developed forward head posture and slouched excessively. Both my upper and lower back were weak, and I didn’t realize how much it was affecting my jaw.

# Clenching and Jaw Misalignment

I noticed that my lower jaw sat too far back, which increased the urge to clench.

# Jaw and Posture Connection

What really surprised me was this:  
When I force myself sit up straight, my lower jaw naturally aligns forward, reducing the urge to clench. The connection between posture and jaw position became crystal clear. It’ll take you just 1 second to try and test it out yourself :)

# What Helped Me Improve Posture

* Strengthening my core: Kettlebell swings
* Opening up my upper back: Foam roller
* Maintaining good posture: Using a posture brace (not all the time, but enough to train my body)

# Food

No alcohol, no coffee.

# The Result

* My jaw now stays in its natural position
* I’m not clenching anymore
* Jaw pain is lower than ever
* And the best part: my tinnitus is the lowest it’s been in 5 years

Yes – tinnitus can improve! I've experienced brief moments of complete silence, free from tinnitus, since I started following the new habits mentioned above. It stole half a decade from me, but I finally feel hopeful again. 

I personally believe that posture is the most common root cause of TMJ, and many people who suffer from it are not aware of this underlying issue. If you’ve had a similar experience, please share!

Juicero ($120 M down the drain), Google Glass ($500 M loss), Quibi ($1.75 B loss)and noticed the same pattern every single time: companies build what they *think* customers want, without ever validating the *real* problems they face.

Here’s what jumping into hundreds of customer conversations and mining thousands of social posts has taught me:

**Most “must‑have” features end up sitting untouched.** Teams burn nights coding bells and whistles… only to hear crickets.  
**Budget bleeds away on guesswork.** Without a clear target, your roadmap becomes a scattergun of half‑baked ideas.  
**Research often feels like incomplete puzzle pieces.** Surveys ask the wrong questions; analytics miss the “why.”  
**That nagging “will anyone actually pay for this?” is 100% valid.** If you’re not talking to real users, you’re flying blind.

# So what really works?

1. **Go to the source.** Talk one‑on‑one with your ideal users. compensate them for 20 minutes of their time and you’ll hear the stories that surveys never capture.
2. **Follow threads, not features.** I’ve learned to skip “Would you use X?” and start with “Tell me about the last time you were stuck doing Y.” Pain points emerge naturally.
3. **Leverage existing data.** Customer support logs, chat transcripts, social posts—these hold hidden clues about what’s really annoying people right now.
4. **Stay curious about context.** Door‑to‑door UX walks, remote screen shares, even a quick coffee chat: sometimes you need to see the environment to understand the problem.

Every time I’ve put these steps into practice, ideas that once felt risky suddenly gained clarity, and pre‑launch interest.

  
Besides product builders, this works for sales, consultants, marketers, and anyone trying to sell anything.

Later on, I found out (according to her) that she had autism.

Our conversations were always kind of one-sided. We planned to meet at the park once, but she canceled, saying she had hurt her leg. She often told me I was treating her differently after she told me about the autism.

She opened up about her past, saying her ex had abandoned her, that she had been seeing another guy but got replaced. One day, after I got mugged, I almost lost her number — the funny thing was, she didn’t seem to care much, she was pretty indifferent and told me she wouldn't text me unless I texted first.

She used to talk a lot about her cats and how her nephews were also autistic. She got really mad once when her cousin mentioned she used to drink with her ex.

Later, I asked her to go to the movies because she used to say we’d never actually go out. At first, she said she wasn’t going because she was too shy, but after I insisted, she agreed. The very next day, though, she asked, ""Wouldn't it be better if we were just friends?""

In the end, we still went to the movies. We met there, bought some candy, kissed during the film, and spent the afternoon cuddling. She never let me see her phone, was always very distant, and didn’t give me her Instagram — only after we broke up, actually.

Another time, we went to the mall, she gave me some chocolate, and we ended up going to a motel. Once there, she told me she was embarrassed and that we couldn’t turn on the lights. I said it was fine, but she quickly became reactive and her mood shifted.

Before that, we had gone to the park and spent the afternoon kissing, and when she was about to go home, I offered to walk her back. It always felt like she was clearly avoiding introducing me to her family. I walked her home and left.

Another time, her sister dropped her off at my place. I mentioned that we didn’t go out much because she was always making excuses, and she got really mad at me for saying that.

One day we were gaming together, and I criticized the game — she got upset and stopped playing. She brought me chocolate later, we spent some time together, and shortly after she talked about breaking up.

She invited me to a party once but then said she wasn’t going anymore, only to change her mind later. I got annoyed and asked her if she didn’t want me to go with her. I told her I’d go and asked if I could arrive earlier, but she made it very clear I should only show up at 6 PM.

I went earlier anyway. Her sister saw me on the street and asked me to come up. Later, we went to her friend’s party, where she introduced me as her boyfriend. Out of nowhere, she said, “Let’s download an app to find a hot girl for you?”

After that, we went to her place. She wanted me to stay the night, but I went home.

After all these situations, I called her and broke up. She started crying and blocked me. Later, she told me I had sent her into therapy and that I had taken her happiness away.

Even so, she sent me a message saying she missed me more than she thought she would. We started talking again. One day, while we were still talking, I found her on a dating app. When I confronted her, she told me she was actually looking for her friend’s ex.

In the end, I told her I loved her. She said it would pass, that she had gone somewhere and wished I was there. Later, she called me and invited me to her mother’s birthday party, but I didn’t go. Her mother even called me asking if I loved her. Later, her mom invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again, and she told me her father was really mad at me. I felt awful and ended up venting about it online. She found out, came to me, and said I had deceived and used her, that she only acted the way she did because of her insecurity and autism, and that she had prayed for me every day.

* I'm seriously dating and spent probably over $400-$500 on dinner dates just this month
* A girl was mad I suggest coffee for a first date and said I was cheap
* A girl was upset I wouldn't take her to a $100+ per person dinner for a first date
* I spent $100+ per person for a dinner date and the girl said she wasn't interested in me right after the dinner

1k2ixfo,https://brewcheck.info,Built a tool to help reduce caffeine crashes by timing your coffee with barometric pressure—might help those cutting back,"Hey everyone,

I know a lot of you here are working to reduce or eliminate caffeine, often because of the side effects—jitters, anxiety, crashes, or even migraines. I’ve been down that road myself, and that’s actually what inspired me to build a little tool called BrewIQ.

It doesn’t tell you what to drink, but rather when—using real-time barometric pressure and weather data to gently guide you on whether it’s a good moment for coffee or something decaf/herbal instead. The goal is to help avoid the sharp energy dips and side effects some people feel when they drink coffee at the wrong time (especially when the weather’s shifting).

Even for those easing off caffeine, this might help reduce symptoms or make the process smoother by avoiding the “high-pressure” moments where your body might react more strongly.

It’s a personal project, not medical advice, and totally free right now. Just curious if something like this might be helpful or interesting to this community.

I wanted to share a write up of my experience with getting a tonsillectomy. I found other write ups on here VERY helpful with preparing for surgery. Reading everyone’s experiences also helped me get in a good mental space! 

I (late 20's F) elected to have a tonsillectomy due to 10+ bouts of tonsillitis over the last year or so and frequent, recurrent illnesses and infections. I was super nervous going into this but I'm over 3 weeks post surgery and I don't regret it one bit!

This is a VERY long post FYI! I wrote it day by day and was on quite a few pain meds but hopefully didn't ramble too much. 

* Day 0: VERY nervous and barely slept the night before. Spoke to medical team and surgeon and they helped calm me down. Surgery went as expected. I woke up in 10/10 pain, they gave me a few pushes of IV fentanyl and a pain pill that kicked in about 45 mins after taking. Pain went down to 6/10. Came home, back to 8/10, found it hard to talk and I was a little bit nauseous and took a Zofran. Ice chips were a god send. Ate vanilla protein ice cream (SF/DF) made in a Ninja Creami which was incredible - I feel like they should prescribe you a ninja creami after a tonsillectomy LOL. Four hours after coming home, I had a second bout of nausea and had vasovagal syncope. This was scary, but passed after about 20 mins. I wasn’t very hungry but tried to eat to make sure I wasn’t taking meds on an empty stomach. Had some cold French onion soup, a tiny piece of a popsicle, a pedialite pop, few bites of plain potatoes, silken tofu, and more Ninja creami protein ice cream. Overall 7/10 pain even with meds. Ended up falling asleep and missing meds. Painful, like an 8.25, but manageable. 
* Day 1: woke up early and in some pain. Took ibuprofen and Tylenol before trying Norco. Just ibuprofen and Tylenol was good for a few hours! Ate 1 scrambled egg, avocado, green goddess dressing, cold French onion soup, chia pudding, and a matcha latte. Matcha was life changing. Eventually after eating took a Norco - felt incredible! Took a shower, brushed teeth, cleaned kitchen, and organized. Pain not going above a 5-6, very manageable. Tried to get cleaning done and calories in before the next few days of pain. I kept a humidifier right by my bed and drank tons of ice water. I used ice packs on face (face wrap), Gua sha, and CBD on neck for swelling. Pedialite popsicle was good but burned a little (maybe from citric acid in it??) but was worth it for electrolytes! By the time it was time for my next doses of ibuprofen and Tylenol I was FEELING IT. Everything burned a bit. Ate small bites of food, by end of day I was pretty miserable.
* Day 2: Rough night, woke up feeling like I have the flu. Pain meds were very necessary. I went on a few short walks outside and had short bursts of energy throughout the day. At this point I was basically living from one pain pill to the next. Was able to eat quite a lot today - breakfast was egg, avo, chia pudding, green goddess dressing, matcha latte. Snacked on GF cinnamon roll, potatoes, protein ice cream, jello, and pedialite popsicles. Ate a big dinner - shirataki noodles, pesto, cottage cheese, peas, and silken tofu. Even ate a lil bit of dessert. Ice packs and LOTS of ice water helping. Throat spray and cepacol cough drops were great today. Pain 6-8/10. With meds, 4-5/10. 
* Day 3: Woke up many times during the night in pain. During the day, I went on walks and went out to run a few short errands. I had little cabin fever and was. a little restless to get out of the house. Able to eat quite a lot again, including things not technically “soft”, just had to chew very well. Very painful, again living from pill to pill but manageable. Easy to distract myself. 7-8/10 pain overall. 
* Day 4: Woke up with what I can only describe as “mind altering” pain, 9.5/10. Not “searing” pain like I would expect if the scabs were coming off, but feels like someone took a jackhammer to my throat and tongue. My tongue was VERY swollen, especially on the sides. Took ibuprofen and Tylenol, iced face, and sat upright to mitigate pain. Swallowing felt as hard as trying to lift a heavy weight, have to mentally prepare to swallow lol. Definitely brutal. Was able to sleep a bit more after meds kicked in. Woke up again, ate tiny bites of food and matcha before taking Norco. Was able to clean house and do laundry, even went on a long walk. Very difficult to talk, sounds like I have a frog in my throat b/c tongue was so swollen (tongue swelling and difficulty speaking lasted a few days). Pain progressively got even worse throughout the day and by night I was so miserable I was crying and hyperventilating, even maxed out on pain meds. Couldn’t drink water and had to spit saliva bc I couldn’t swallow. Debating going to ER for morphine drip. Today was honestly more of a mental battle to get through the pain. Overall today was a 9.5-10/10 pain even maxed out on meds. 
* Day 5: Rough night again. Woke up several times in excruciating pain. Very rough day. Able to run some errands and go on a walk but really struggled if I didn’t have something to distract myself. Waves of agonizing pain, like so painful that I couldn’t scroll on my phone or watch anything, just had to wait for it to pass.  Pain was mostly in my tongue and I felt like it was very swollen so I had to just hold ice in my mouth to get the swelling to go down. Took a nice bath but the pain meds only last about 45 mins-1 hour so after that it was agony again. Overall 9-10/10 pain.
* Day 6: Very rough night again, woke up multiple times. Rough start to the day. Able to eat oatmeal and a few bites of french toast! Realized I am severely dehydrated from not being able to drink yesterday and made it my goal to drink 3L of water to avoid going to the ER for dehydration. Eventually went to gym and went on stationary bike for 30 mins. Was in zone 1 but sweat a LOT - this was great as it felt like the sweating reduced a ton of inflammation in my tongue. Later went for a long walk. Ate some pizza! Pain waxed and waned throughout day and got worse at night. Tongue still very swollen. Daytime pain was a 5/10, night was 8-9/10.  
* Day 7 - I was EXHAUSTED from sleep deprivation and took a few naps throughout the day. I was also RAVENOUS and ate 3 big meals!!! Ice chips were a life saver today for swelling of tongue. Difficulty getting to sleep at night from pain, was like an 8/10 at night. 
* Day 8 - still a rough night and woke up 3x+, but feeling much much better. I feel like I can breathe so well and my body isn’t attacking itself, like the chronic tonsil swelling is gone. My skin completely cleared up even eating dairy/gluten and my jaw line looks great. I felt like a fog has lifted. Went to gym and did a hard workout (no lift, just cardio). Ate a lot, felt ravenous again! Goal is to sleep uninterrupted tonight. Pain during the day was a 2/10, night was a 7/10. 
* Day 9: Slept okay-ish, around 8 hours with only minor interruptions. Still woke up in pain, first thing I did was go get coffee and ibuprofen. Went to the April 5th protest today - walked for about 2 hours total before feeling weak and in pain and headed back home to relax. (PS for any Americans in this sub - politics is VERY important right now and is having a major impact on the healthcare system. Stay informed and protest if you can!) I went home and rested for the rest of the day. Today I ate egg+veggie scramble, tuna melt, jello, and ramen w/ veg.  Overall pain 4-5/10.
* Day 10: Slept very well but still woke up exhausted. Sleep deprevation getting to me for sure - had to take 2 naps and felt like I had the flu. Ran a few errands but had to go home b/c felt weak. Rested for the rest of the day. Ate some snacks, ramen, and yogurt. Tried a little sriracha and it was no problem! (Thank goodness, I miss spicy food so much). Took ibuprofen, tylenol, and 1 norco today when pain got really bad. Overall pain 4-5/10.
* Day 11: Feel much better than yesterday! Went grocery shopping, had an acai bowl which felt fantastic on my throat. Banana was okay, a little spicy on my throat but manageable. Went  to the gym for a bit. Able to eat a full meal without any real difficulty. Still a little hard to open my mouth wide to eat/yawn/cough but overall okay. 
* Day 12: doing great. Still having some trouble sleeping and been taking ibuprofen regularly but manageable. Feels like a case of tonsillitis. Went to the gym and went on a long walk to get ice cream. Late in the evening my throat started to hurt again (4-5/10) so I took some Tylenol to go to sleep. 
* Day 13: did pretty good today. Able to go to the gym but a little tired overall. Took Tylenol and ibuprofen. Pain again was worse at night and had to take Tylenol to sleep.
* Day 14: woke up in a surprising amount of pain (6/10). My throat feels dry and scratchy, probably from the room being less humid than it has been the last few weeks. Sat by the humidifier and had a pedialite popsicle which helped. Went back to work the next day! 
* Skip to day 20/21: went back to full work in person this whole week without trouble. On day 21 I got clearance from my surgeon that I’m 90% healed which is ahead of the curve with the normal healing process!!! Can return to normal activities. He saw some small scabs left which I’ve felt peel off the last few days. Painful when I swallow, but very manageable :) 
* I’m so so happy that I went through with this surgery. If yall want me to follow up in a few months on my progress I will!

**Most important things to have prepared before surgery:**

* Comfy place to sleep and rest with all important things nearby (meds/water/ice packs/etc.). I had a little basket with all of my important things nearby!
* Humidifier - so many people in this sub said the humidifier was very important to have. I kept one on and near me most of the day. I’m not sure how much it helped me but it was nice to have! Make sure your humidifier is CLEAN, disinfected, and use distilled water only. 
* Ice wrap: see link. Very helpful especially when the pain was very bad. My only complaint is that it only ices the sides of your face so I had to hold an ice pack up to my neck too. Some people here said they had ear pain after surgery - I did not get ear pain but if I did, this would have been very helpful.
* CBD/icy hot for your neck. I think this helped the swelling a lot and was just nice to have. 
* Miralax/laxatives: my surgeon prescribed Senna but I supplemented with miralax and Senna tea as needed. Very important! Also, EAT YOUR FIBER! I had chia pudding, spinach, oatmeal, etc.
* Electrolytes - pedialite and pedialite popsicles. The popsicles burned a little bit but were very worth it for the electrolytes. 
* Ice chips - I saw some people on this sub either bought ice chips or had an ice chip maker, I personally just stuck some regular ice cubes in a fabric bag and smashed them with a rolling pin until they were small. I put them in an insulated cup and ate them with a spoon. Absolutely fantastic. 
* Pain relieving cough drops: I used the Mucinex brand that have hexylresorcinol in them. Use as directed. I did not appreciate these enough - they were actually very helpful at numbing my mouth and throat. 
* Sore throat spray: I used the Mucinex brand again that had benxocaine and menthol in it. Use as directed (and don’t swallow it!). 

**Other tips:**

* Bonus - Ninja Creami: greatest purchase I have ever made, especially for this surgery. I made DF/SF protein ice creams and this was very good to eat. Very nutritious and feels good on the throat!
* Staying consistent with oral care. Even though I didn’t feel well, I still made it a point to brush/floss 2-3x per day and use antiseptic mouthwash.
* A good support system: I had a group of wonderful friends and family who were there to help take care of me. I also had plans in case I needed help getting to an ER for a bleed or dehydration.
* A good mental outlook! This was most important for me. 
* Last but not least, follow your doctors advice: this is a sub for support but not medical advice. If you have an urgent or emergent medical concern, go to the ER or call your doctor and don’t rely on this sub (ex: if you see me recommending throat spray but your doctor says don’t use it, then don’t use it)!

Good luck to all who are having surgeries soon! AMA and I'll answer any questions to the best of my ability! :) ",1,1745019423.0,Tonsillectomy,0,1.0,False
1k2itx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnciAubreyWu/comments/1k2itx1/who_am_i/,Who am I?,"There were some things I was wrong about. I did judge VHH based on some earlier rumors and the fact they were working with the parents. I wanted Aubrey found but prayed she wouldn't go home to her parents before being evaluated.  So, VHH, I do apologize for my initial feelings and misinformation.I am sorry.  I support you both a 110% and what you do. If you ever need help doing ground searches, I know how and can help out in the future. 

I admit I fibbed a bit in here.  To throw off the rabid supporters. I was being harrassed a lot, called a ring leader, got messages and phone calls. I wasn't a ring leader. I simply asked a series of questions directly to JG, about her clothes, about Panera, about the phones and who had them and so on. That upset him.  

I, also, called in a tip after VHH released the Wawa photos. Told JG directly on reddit several times. Instead of asking me about it (remember, police weren't helping), he dismissed, ignored then attacked me. 

I was threatened with legal action. I was harrassed by followers. I had to file a police report. 

It didn't stop me from looking. I did fear the worse and glad I am wrong. 

But this all began because I shared his first or second post on my page and stated there were red flags. He inboxed me and threatened me. Blocked me. I have been blocked since his second Easton post! 

By the way, I worked with children for a large portion of my career, from day care in my home to working with kids with autism to working in a group home for troubled youth. Literally have worked with runaways. Have followed them down train tracks and busy highways until police could locate us. Have sat in the hospital with kids. I have seen it all. I was one of them at one time. I still keep in contact with some of my students. Some doing great. Some still struggling. I can admit the system fails kids. I pray it doesn't fail AW this time. 

I have made some friends through here. And would love to meet up at a coffee house or something soon. 

It is I. Lucky Examination, the first reddit ghoul that was doxxed and threatened to be punched in the face. He was so mad he was spitting. LOL! Tell you the truth I wasn't worried about him but his deranged followers. Mentally unstable, some of them.

Anywhoo, I feel more comfortable now that the truth I have been suspecting is coming out. I pray Aubrey finds healing. It is possible. I am proof. Been through hell and back too. I know some of you have been too and that is why we supported Aubrey not the parents. We saw through the BS very early on. 

I pray for her strength, I pray for her voice, I pray for healing and peace. ",23,1745019273.0,EnciAubreyWu,3,1.0,False

Start off with her attitude about “ Puddy” .. The way she acted in her makeup video about “ if you were a resident in the “ home “ and saw “ Puddy “ coming in … I get it ! Of course , she’s a proud Grams .. I’m a ProudGrams too. But, her arrogance is over the top …

In her stories showing the video at the “ Home “ You could hear one of them commenting “ Ohhh , Free Food “ 
I have NEVER seen such behavior in people who try to put their “ High Social Status “  diamonds …..not understand common sense… These places Churches , Assisted Living places plan these events as a community service . Out reach . ( ive be planing these events for years ) Of course every one  is invited but in planing hoping to reach families, children who might not get these special treats, coffee ,food .. People and Moms who might not be able to afford Easter Eggs hunts for their child .. or Moms who can’t afford fancy coffee like we all treat ourselves to ! It’s not suppose to be people who flaunt their diamonds ( lol) and car loads of expensive makeup and skin care coming and taking snacks for their diaper bags … Filling up their bellies with free food .. Of course they are Welcome to go and would never be turned away but anyone with any moral , Christian conscience would see how wrong it is .. not to participate…. but to take … without giving ..
 Someone in her group is heard saying ohhh free food .. After showing the very full Coney  dogs I’m sure they serve themselves and sure filled them up good ! 
My question is … What did they take to this event to say “ Thank you “  Homemade cards for these sweet residents … Extra filled eggs to let them pass out to others … A Easter Craft .. A Bible bookmark.. a plant for their room … NOTHING ! Expect… Yum.  Free food … and then go out to eat and fill up more … and to Costco and buy extra “ dip “ for the weekend …
Teach “ Puddy “ to serve .. Something her children don’t get at all. Or at least Avery … She’s one of those who smile sweetly and act all Miss Christian and then gets in the car and rolls her eyes and calls her Mom names ! 
They are Takers… Want a be’s   Cheap with no manners … Never Serving others … Always a show … 
And No if you are reading this KIM. I am not at all jealous… I have a very nice home …. Very very successful Family business ( Ran by my sons) a career of my own . A college education.. Bible education ( although, I’m not setting a good example in this post. But grrr) ..  Grandchildren I am very proud of … My sons have their own very nice homes . Active / leaders  in church There is nothing I see to be Jealous of… Just a very immature grown woman ..with issue of low self esteem ..trying to look ok … A Grown woman wanting to run with the “ popular .. Wealthy” like Highschool .. At your age you should know and Christian growth that it’s something you can’t buy ! You can’t pretend to have … people are drawn to people who “ show Jesus “ … People have that glow .. thst something that others want to be around you because of your relationship with him .    They feel seen , heard , loved .. it’s not about “ tooting your own horn …I really feel very very sorry for you and today on Good Friday a little sick to my stomach….  But I know “ It works for you “ “ it’s all fine “ “ Go past it “ 
My Grandparents always said .. Those who have most of the time you would never know it ..those who really don’t try to act like they do ……

I’ve been exploring a startup idea called [BrewIQ](https://brewcheck.info), a simple tool that tells you when to drink your coffee for max energy and minimal crash—based on barometric pressure and weather data.

Why? Turns out, atmospheric pressure can significantly affect how your body responds to caffeine (energy dips, headaches, jitteriness), but no one really talks about it. BrewIQ gives you a daily “Go” or “Hold” signal so you’re not just drinking coffee by habit—you’re sipping smarter.

Target users:
	•	Biohackers
	•	Wellness-minded folks
	•	People prone to pressure-related headaches
	•	Coffee lovers trying to avoid the 2PM crash

It’s still early, but I’d love your thoughts on:
	•	Is this too niche or a real problem worth solving?
	•	Freemium vs. one-time purchase?
	•	Smart ways to validate and grow this?

I’m 17 and I’ve never really learned how to cook — not even an egg, not even coffee. It’s honestly starting to bother me more than I expected.

It makes me feel a little ashamed, like I’ve missed out on an important life skill. I really want to change that, but I don’t know where to begin. I’m not sure if it’s going to be really difficult, or if once I get started it’ll just click.

1k2ia48,https://brewcheck.info,I built BrewIQ – an app that uses barometric pressure to optimize your coffee timing,"Hey biohackers!

You track sleep, HRV, macros, supplements—but are you still guessing when to drink your coffee?

I built BrewIQ, a lightweight app that uses real-time barometric pressure and weather data to help you time your caffeine for max focus, fewer crashes, and better neurological response. Atmospheric pressure can affect how your body processes caffeine (and influence things like headaches, fatigue, or even productivity). So why not use that to your advantage?

BrewIQ gives you a daily green light (or hold off) signal based on environmental conditions, so your coffee hits right—whether you’re training, working, or just trying to stay dialed in.

It’s early stage, so I’d love feedback from other biohackers. Is this something you’d use? What features would you want?

Appreciate any insights!

1k2i5qu,https://brewcheck.info,Built a tool to help time your coffee based on barometric pressure—might help with migraine triggers,"Hi everyone,

I know many folks here track their triggers closely—weather, stress, sleep, diet… and yes, coffee. I’ve dealt with weather-related fatigue and pressure headaches myself, so I started wondering: What if I could better time my coffee to work with my body, not against it?

So I created a free tool called BrewIQ. It uses real-time barometric pressure and weather data to suggest when it might be a better (or worse) time to drink coffee. The idea is to help avoid crashes, potential pressure-triggered headaches, and that awful jittery spiral that sometimes follows caffeine.

I’m not claiming it’s a cure or a fix—just a gentle guide to help you sip more mindfully based on atmospheric conditions. It’s super simple, no medical advice, just data + timing.

What's the best way to fight zombie kerfur ? I read about some people trapping it inside the incinerator, but I failed at it during phase 1.

The morning after checking in I went to the lobby to grab a cup of coffee and went outside for a smoke. I was initially there by myself, but a guy comes out and we start chatting. He told me that he was there for a ""business conference"" and asked me what I do for a living. I told him that I was self employed and explained the nature of what I do (I work in a position that is adjacent to the insurance industry. I don't work for an insurance company but I'm hired by insurance companies to perform my job). He proceeds to tell me that he works in the insurance industry and was wondering if I would be interested in hearing about his company. I didn't really want to but I wasn't thinking that I was about to be recruited into an MLM so I agreed. 

That's when he asked me if I've ever heard of a company called Primerica. I told him that I have absolutely heard of Primerica and remember when it was known as A.L. Williams. I also told him that I was recruited to that company many years ago and was glad to not fall into it. I told him that I don't support MLM's and if he chooses that path, so be it. I'm not interested.

I guess that I was too gentle in declining to listen to his sales pitch so he began to tell me how much ""the business"" has changed his life. He tried to convince me that he was also self employed and had a great team that he works with. So I once again tell him that I don't support MLM's and have no interest whatsoever in joining his team. 

I lit another smoke and then I loaded both barrels and started firing. My first question was pretty simple - ""How much money did you make last year?"" He didn't give a straight answer and tried to deflect. I asked again a second time and he went off on how you need to create a team and find the right people to be on that team, plus a bunch of other bullshit all related to teamwork and collaboration. 
 
I told him that if he didn't want to talk about money that's fine since I won't share how much I made last year. So I asked him how many people he has on his team. He said that he has about 20. I asked how many were upline and how many were downline. At that point he told me that he had to go and wished me good luck. 

For the next two days, when he saw me having a smoke he went to the other side of the building.

My husband is doing side hustles to make extra payments on the car and pay it up faster, then tackle the loan and then finally the cc. But today he had a car accident. He’s ok, thankfully. Nothing happened to him and he was by himself. He crashed into cement, so nobody else was involved whch is another blessing! But the damage is pretty bad. If we pay it out of pocket, it’s about 3k which was our tax refund and i had put it into savings after having no savings bc we helped out my FIL pay his medical bills with it. If we go the insurance route, they will totaled the car but it’s an old car and what they give us wouldn’t really cover the cost of an additional car which means another car payment. And the insurance premium would go up, too. Idk what to do at this point. I’d never tell him because he feels really bad about it already and i need to be his rock rn, but im mad at him for not paying attention to the road when driving.

I wish i would’ve finished even if i didn’t like it so that i could have a backup plan and help out. I don’t spend any money on me, like at all, no clothes or shoes of hair salon or really anything. Not even coffee trips. I sell the kids clothes at a consignment store and buy their clothes there too. I use coupons for our groceries and don’t buy name brands. I don’t eat out, always cook and make a lot lf things from scratch. I started a garden, too, to not have to buy all our fruits and veggies and have them for free. Im really trying to cut back on our cost of living expenses. So yeah, the next step is for me to bring home money, too. Obviously we can’t afford daycare for me to get a job and without a bachelors, i wouldn’t be able to get a job that had anything leftover after daycare. Im going to do side hustles too to cover for a few things but damn, we were actually starting to execute our plan and we’re going to pay off the car by late fall/ early winter, now we most likely won’t be able to do that. Again, im so frustrated. It seems like every time we game one step forward, we take 3 backs and never really get ahead. He’s in the military and currently not home for a while. So it’s just me and the kids which is stressful enough.
Sorry for the rant but I can’t tellall this to my husband when he’s already beating himself up and I figured, yall know what it’s like to have financial setbacks.",3,1745016840.0,debtfree,9,1.0,False

The spark died a long time ago and despite my own efforts in reviving things, it takes two to make it work. Leaving isn't an option right now, so don't suggest that. 

Ultimately, my emotional needs aren't being met and I'd like to feel a spark again ✨️ I miss feeling desired and having someone interested in me as a person.

I'm 30 yrs old, from Edmonton, Alberta. I'm short, average body, dark hair and eyes, pretty face. My personality is kind, thoughtful, funny, and chill ☺️

Some general interests of mine are watching movies, listening to podcasts, vintage clothes shopping, and doing creative things like art. Big fan of coffee and food lol

Seeking someone consistent in communication, emotionally mature, and kind 😊 age range from 30-35.

Ignore the flair, had to choose one so I could post haha

1k2hz1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/1k2hz1y/fatigue_and_nonsero_ra/,Fatigue and NonSero RA,"I have had the most insane fatigue for the last 5 or 6 months.  It's become totally normal for me to take a three+ hour nap. I experienced this sleepiness while on Actemra weekly injections. However, I'm now on Enbrel weekly injections.

Today, I woke up at 6 am, drank a cup of coffee and went back to bed until 3:00 p.m..  I have no idea what to attribute this to. I exercise, CrossFit 5 days/week. I'm 59, I eat well. I have a drink with my husband in the evening. I do smoke pot. However, I have tested this theory and pot does not make me feel like the tiredness I'm experiencing.  I have NonSero RA and have been on multiple biologics along with Leflunomide daily.

Do any of you experience anything like this?

Thanks for reading.
