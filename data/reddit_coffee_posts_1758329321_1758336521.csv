A regular customer noticed more money was removed from his gift card then what was shown on his receipt.

His card was down to 0$ so we reloaded 50$, the balance was then exactly 50$.

He bought a coffee for 3.10$ (after tax) so the balance should have been 46.90$ but the balance was 46.72$. 

The money was loaded onto a Canadian gift card, with Canadian currency and he was charged in Canadian. 

There is nothing on the receipt that shows where the extra 18 cents went. 

I've shown it to my manager and district manager and both werent able to give an answer.

Is there an explanation for this?

I've checked if this happened on other customers gift card transactions and it is happening on some but not all.

**Memory Transcript Subject:** Zotta, Expeditionary Fleet Xeno-Biologist

**Date:** January 29, 2158

I was at my wits end at this point. I’d been chewing my claws from both ends trying to make heads or tails of the genetic samples I’d gotten a couple of days ago and each result only brought with it more questions. The only thing I could say for sure was that whoever these xenos had been they’d done a great deal of tampering with their own genome for technological use. All three samples I had taken, the small creatures, the tree-like ones and the ship itself all shared at least some of the same genetic code. The real question that had continued to eat me up was the connection between the trees and the smaller creatures. Which was the actual sentient?

With little left I could learn from simply pouring over genomic data any longer I finally was forced to call Officer Monahan down to assist me in the task I had been putting off… examining the cadaver we had brought back from the alien vessel. My stomach was already feeling queasy as I recalled the creature’s unique… odor.

For his part Monahan didn’t look any more excited than myself to pull the creature out of the freezer and have the medical drones start scanning it. I had opted to use the drones rather than a more classic autopsy since I dreaded to even think what that creature must smell like on the inside. Thankfully Dr. Trilf had accompanied the bulky human down to the lab, bringing with him three small vials of liquid, passing one to Monahan and myself while keeping the third for himself. The Zurulian popped the cap on his own vial, pouring a small dab out onto one of his paw pads before dabbing it under his nose.

“It’s called peppermint oil.” Doc explained, “One of the human medical professionals finest inventions. Just do as I did. You’re going to need it.” Monahan and myself followed suit, dabbing a bit of the oil under our nostrils. Instantly a potent, almost spicy scent filled my nose, making me cough. It wasn’t unpleasant but it certainly was powerful.

With our sense of smell properly fortified, Monahan finally opened the freezer on the far side of the room, pulling up the black, sealed bag containing the dead xeno. The human quickly brought it over to one of the free desks and laid it out, unzipping the bag as he turned his head away. Thankfully, between the peppermint oil and the freezer the smell of the corpse had been toned down enough to at least make it tolerable.

I twitched my whiskers as I eyed the strange being in the bag once more. It was so vastly different than anything in any of the archives.

“The first mollusk with sentience ever found.” Doc spoke up at last, climbing up onto a nearby stool so he could see on top of the desk, “That will certainly be quite a notch on your resume.” I cocked my head at him, twitching my ears inquisitively. “I read your findings.” He explained, seemingly sensing my question, “The presence of familiar Mantle Secretome gene variants as well as Shell Matrix Proteins is hard evidence to dispute.”

“Thank you Dr. Trilf!” I squeaked, feeling a bit giddy that someone else on the crew had read and apparently appreciated my logged report.

“Think nothing of it dear.” The Zurulian said, waving his ears in a dismissive gesture, “Now what say we have the drones begin a full medical scan? I’m most interested to see what our odiferous friend’s internals look like.” I flicked my tail in the affirmative, glancing over to the pair of shiny metal orbs that had been floating expectantly in the corner. They lacked most of the manipulator parts that the maintenance drones had, but made up for it in the sheer number of scans they could perform as well as the amount of first aid supplies they carried in their side compartments.

“Begin full spectrum medical analysis on the target.” I ordered, gesturing my head towards the corpse. The drones noiselessly floated over, turning the array of lenses on their front side towards the body. There was no visual indication of what the two devices were doing, since most of the scans they ran operated well outside the visual range of most living things, but it was obvious by their slow movement back and forth they were working.

Within a few brief moments we had our results, indicated by a small ping on my holopad. I quickly picked it off my belt and opened the result notification. The drones had scanned for several different things simultaneously and, although the chemical detection scans were interesting enough in themselves it was the xray and MRI scans that caught my immediate attention. I quickly made a couple of taps on my pad to send the resulting images to the holoprojector in the corner of the room.

A three dimensional rendering of the results came shining out of the projector for the group to see. The creature was… remarkably simple considering its fairly large genetic code. A few things were immediately obvious. Firstly was its digestive system. It appeared to be nothing but a straight tube running from the top of its stalk down to the bottom where the legs intersected. No stomach or similar organ in sight. Aside from that was a lack of any visible form of respiratory exchange. No detectable lung or gill like structures. Something else noticeably missing were any sort of internal skeletal structure. That last one though hadn’t been entirely unexpected. Ever since I had made the determination that these xenos were some sort of mollusk analog I had suspected it would be the case. Their physical structure was mostly maintained by the loosely jointed, shell-like structures on their outside. I could see that they possessed at least rudimentary vision organs that seemed to be located in small, eye-like structures around the top part of their stalk, giving the creatures no less than a dozen eyes. Although judging by their size and complexity it was doubtful they had possessed very good vision.

Doc was the first one to notice the most remarkable thing of all though.

“What an unusual brain structure.” The Zurulian remarked, leaning in further and squinting his eyes at the holographic projection, “While it’s impossible to tell without a living one to do some comparative neural analysis on… I’d venture a guess that it has very little in the way of a pre-frontal cortex.”

“And this section over here looks similar to an olfactory cortex but… it’s huge.” I noted with a point of my own, “But I don’t even see a respiratory system on any of these scans.”

“It isn’t entirely necessary to be able to breathe in order to have something akin to a sense of smell.” Doc suggested, “In fact a large part of the Kolshian’s sense of smell was entirely derived from chemo receptors on their skin.” I paused to consider that. It was certainly conceivable although I still wondered how these creatures had survived without any sort of gas exchange system.

“Lord save me.” Monahan sighed, reaching into a pocket on the dusty brown jacket he was wearing and pulling out a small metal flask, “I have no idea what you lot are saying.” He finished, twisting the cap off of his container and taking a deep swig from it. I was tempted for a moment to ask him if it might be coffee when the holoprojection seemed to flash, the flickering image getting my attention and pulling me back to it.

The projection quickly faded away and was instead replaced by a series of jumbled characters. As I looked at it the visual portion of the translator implant seemed to freak out, twisting and jumbling possible translations for a moment. The problem was fairly evident. Whatever was written there was in a mixture of alphabets. I could recognize a couple of human letters from their western hemisphere languages. There was also two Dossur letters and a couple of instances of the Vinlil’s flowing script.

After a moment of work the translator app finally seemed to settle on a translation of whatever this bizarre anomaly was.

“So proud. Grown. Worthy. Beautiful. Worthy.”

“What the hell’s going on with the projector?” Monahan asked, cocking his head at it, “What’s that nonsense its’ spewing out?”

“Not sure.” Doc grumbled, reaching for his own holopad, “I’ll send a quick message to Gothlir on the ship’s message board to look into… oh.” The old Zurulian paused, prompting Monahan and myself to look over his shoulder at his holopad. The ship’s message board (which we usually reserved for simply filing maintenance requests) was already full. It seemed every single crewmate, save for the captain who was already on the bridge with the Gojid, had filed something within the last few seconds.

“Oh joy.” Officer Monahan grunted, stowing his small metal container back in his pocket, “Wonder what’s up? Think the maintenance drones are spying on Leo and Vakks again?” Doc offered an uncharacteristic chuckle at that. I was about to ask what they were talking about when a sudden message came out over each of our holopads.

“This is Captain Reynolds. Requesting all crew members to assemble on the bridge.”

I sighed, dropping the subject before scampering myself across the table and leaping up onto Monahan. The Terran just laughed as my tiny claws bit into his synthetic pelt and I pulled myself up onto his shoulder.

“You think they found the black box on that old Federation ship?” I squeaked hopefully, although in my head I was more than certain this was probably about the string of odd maintenance requests.

One short elevator ride later and I would get my answer which, to my equal delight and dismay was both! The rest of the crew had seemed to beat us there. Leo and Vakks were taking their usual seat in the back of the available crew positions with Mok’lil carefully positioning herself as far to away as possible. Gothlir was busy rushing his bulky frame back and forth between several machines while occasionally stopping to frantically tap out something on his holopad.

“Before anyone says anything I KNOW about the spehing system errors.” The Gojid cursed, “I’m worried there was a payload in the black box we found on the Fed wreck. We remote downloaded the data and this drahk started.”

“Language while on the bridge ensign.” Captain Reynolds growled, her face stuck in that stern, unreadable form that I had seen her take many times by now, “Regardless the black box is over a century old. Even if it’s causing some bugs its still outdated Federation garbage. Gothlir should be able to get everything smoothed out shortly and we can view the contents.”

“Never heard of the Feds putting malware or something in black boxes.” Vakks grumbled skeptically from the back, “I still think this is related to the drones the last night.”

“And would you care to elaborate onto your reasoning Ensign Vakks?” Reynolds asked, turning her attention to the Skalgan.

“Because I got a fucking notification on my drahking holopad that was just a picture of me and… well it was a picture from the drone that was malfunctioning!” She blurted back, although after her slight pause I noticed a slight orange tinge sneak into her cheeks and ears. It still amused me how much the hot tempered Skalgan used human curses. I imagine she must have gotten them off Leo. I made a note to get her to tell me what she was talking about with the drones though. I hadn’t heard anyone else mention that yet.

As Monohan took a seat he looked over at her with a strange “half smile” gesture that I believed was meant to look… smug perhaps?

“Anyone else in that picture Cottonball?” He asked with a laugh, even earning a quiet chuckle from the good Dr. Trilf who crawled his way up into the seat beside us.

“Cottonball?” I repeated, the translator implant giving the me description of a plant based swabbing instrument typically used by Terrans for first aid.

“Yeah.” Monahan explained, gently reaching up and rubbing one of his massive, apposable thumbs across my head in an affectionate manner, “I used to call her that as a kid. You shoulda seen her! So much wool that she looked like…” He was cut off as Captain Reynolds loudly (and pointedly) cleared her throat.

“OFFICER MONAHAN.” The Captain spoke, her voice loud and demanding, “I would ask you to behave yourself in a professional manner during a clearly pressing security matter.”

“Of course Cap’n.” He responded, though that half grin gesture never seemed to leave his face. Vakks for her part hadn’t spoken back up, only appearing to grow even more orange tinted at the security officer’s words.

“I g…got a… a p… poem.” Mok’lil spoke up, “I…. it was quite bi… bizarre.”

“What sort of poem?” The Captain asked, seeming to take the Krokotl’s account just as importantly as the rest. Though if I thought about it getting a poem seemed like an awful silly thing to report a potential bug on the ship message board.

“M… my room’s tel… tel… television. It s… started scroll… scrolling th… this over and over al… along with my holopad!” She squawked, pulling out her own datapad and hurrying over to pass it to the Captain. I let out a silent sigh of relief at that. Mok’lil was a nice enough lady when she wasn’t slipping some underhanded predator comment at you but… I think I would have chewed my own tail off if I had to listen to her stutter out a whole poem.

Reynolds looked down at the holopad, slowly darting those binocular eyes back and forth across the screen as she read the full transcript. “Your children are not your children… they are the sons and daughters of life’s longing for itself…” She muttered, barely loud enough for my translator to pick up on it. Her eyes narrowed as she stared at the holopad, seemingly lost in thought. “I… I know this.” She said at last, that cold, collected look on her face passing for just a moment. In t=its stead I saw something new. Something I hadn’t seen from her before. A brief moment of… sadness? No. It was more than that… heartbreak. As quickly as it appeared though it passed and the UN officer in her regained her composure.

“Thank you for your input Dr. Moklil.” She continued, handing the holopad back to the Krokotl researcher, “I’m sure we will have all of this figured out shortly.” She turned her binocular gaze back onto the frantically scurrying Gojid. Seemingly sensing her eyes upon him he turned back up towards her.

“Well the AI finished decoding the black box contents but as for the ship errors it’s still working on that.” Gothlir explained, “Want me to pull up the contents while we wait?”

“Please.” The Captain answered, flicking her chair about to face the room’s holoprojector. A moment later the holographic display shimmered to life, the image of a small, 3 man crew of Kolshians appearing on the three-dimensional image.

 

**\*Command log, \[Standardized Human Date: \*\*\*\* 1928\]\***   

The screen showed a crew of five Kolshians, each seated at a command terminal as the one the we would have to assume is the captain looked straight ahead at the camera. It wasn’t a memory transcript but those weren’t as common back then. The assumed captain stared straight ahead at the camera lens.

“This is captain Noljiz of Federation scout #738. We have arrived in the system from which the massive energy signature originated. What we’ve found is…” He turns in his swiveling chair, staring out the forward viewport of the ship he was in, clearly showing a desolate field of debris.

“Destruction. A level of destruction that civilized prey society has never seen. We can only assume that a predatory species is responsible for this.” The Kolshian twirled his tentacles in front of his chest. I didn’t recognize the meaning of that but from the way his large, bulbous eyes darted about I made the assumption that it was a nervous gesture. “Our current scans of the system show no apparent life signs. No potential planets and…”

A voice from somewhere out of frame pipe in, “We’ve charted a basic debris free rout Sir. But… We see several vessels sitting around the secondary planet.” The figure of Captain Nolkiz turned around, eyeing the figure off screen with a sense of alarm.

“Do we have a read on their vectors?” He asked anxiously, to which one of the other two Kolshians who were in view of the recording turned around.

“Most of them are moving off in the opposite direction."" The secondary crew member announced, “Although we do see one vessel headed towards us.”

“Make preparations to initiate FTL!” The captain exclaimed, his frantic tentacle movements becoming more and more agitated, “We need to get out of here and notify the Commonwealth!” As he gave the order though the screen seemed to dim, signaling the loss of seemingly all lighting on the bridge of the scout vessel, save for a single glowing communication monitor that could be seen nearby.

“Forgive us.” Came a cold, chilling voice that was clearly not speaking in Kolshian (Though what language it was in was hard to say) “But we are so few left. We can’t let you tell the rest of your cult.”

“Who… whoever this is…” The captain’s voice stammered out, the vague outline of his form being visible in the soft green glow of the only lit monitor, “I am Captain Noljiz of the Galactic Federation, We did not come seeking conflict…”

“You lie.” The strange, cold voice cut him off, “But it is only because you do not know better. Even now, monstrous as the things your people have done may be… we still love you. One day we will come back when we have prepared… we will save your people Captain. We will save those you have hurt and those you yet wish to hurt. I only wish you could have been there for that day… Forgive me.” A moment later the screen lit up with a bright light as the sound of Kolshian’s screaming echoed before fading into static….

 

**Memory Transcript Subject:** Desmond Washington, Ambassadorial Escort

**Date:** January 30, 2158

 

The trip back was even worse than the trip there. Sure the trip there had been nerve wracking in the sense that everyone was expecting the worst but… the trip back? The trip back was everyone KNOWING the worst. I didn’t even know how to wrap my mind around it. These tin-cans decide to show up out of nowhere and just announce their gonna suck out everyone’s brains and put us into machines? Or was that even the case? From the way the alien robot had been talking he (if that thing could even be said to have a gender) seemed to not even be sure if he actually was a person in a metal body or just a copy of a person in a metal body?!?!

“Hey mate.” Came Ruta’s voice as the Yotul elbowed me, “Come out of it. Spiraling isn’t gonna help.” The diminutive marsupial gave a wag of her tail, a gesture I think was meant to be encouraging, “If humans can come straight out the burrow and crush a government that’s ruled for over a thousand years you can take a bunch of rusty metal heads that just showed up right?”

I smiled, appreciating my friend’s attempt to pull me back together, even if she sounded more uncertain about things than I felt.

“Plus I need someone sane to talk to.” She continued, her voice a whisper now, “Sergeant Basu is having a panic attack because they won’t let him call his wife and Walters is…” She paused, looking over to where Cassius had seated himself next the Vinlil Captain, Hult. The two seemed to be sitting quite close, their faces next to one another so that they could talk without being overheard.

“Being Walters.” I finished with a disbelieving groan. How could he possibly think about flirting with some alien he just met at a time like this? I swore that if these Directorate assholes conquered us tomorrow Walters’ would still worry more about getting laid than the fate of his own life. I looked around the cabin, finding most of the other occupants in an equal state of silent agitation. At least on they way here our holopads had been working and we could watch videos or make calls. On the return trip the ship had forcibly disabled any long range communication. As adept as our new enemies were at cyber warfare and as willing as they were to use it, any form of off-ship communication was deemed too dangerous to risk.

I could feel the anxiety and dread starting to form tight knots in my stomach, making me feel physically ill from the stress. The sight of the previously optimistic ambassador Reyneros sitting dejectedly in a corner, silently staring at the metal floor of the transport only made it worse. “R… Ruta…” I panted, putting a hand up to my lips as I felt my mouth begin to fill with saliva, “I think I’m gonna be sick…”

“Go!” The Yotul exclaimed, pushing me towards one of the two available restrooms on the ship, “Go before you throw up!” She insisted.

I rushed over to the latrine, throwing open the door and rushing inside as I felt the bile begin to rise in my throat. In a flash I slammed the door shut and leaned over the toilet as I lost it. I gagged loudly as hot, acrid stomach acid began to pour out. I silently wished I had eaten more today as my stomach quickly emptied itself and yet I continued to heave, my throat convulsing as nothing came up. After a moment the wave of sickness seemed to pass and I sat there, holding onto the toilet and sitting on my knees trying to catch my breath. Then, suddenly, the message alert on my holopad went off.

I reached down, pulling the pad off my belt in confusion. This ship’s signal jammers should have prevented any incoming or outgoing messages, and yet I could see a video chat invitation waiting on my holopad. More confused than ever as it registered as “unknown caller” I simply pressed the answer button out of curiosity. I quickly regretted it.

As the video feed loaded I found myself facing that horrific, hulking pile of metal and sugarcoated threats that we had left at the rendezvous point the day before. Well at least I assumed it was the same one. I really had no way of knowing. It certainly looked just like it though.

“Hello the Desmond.” Came a voice over the call, this one certainly different from the envoy we had encountered on the deserted planetoid. The other had come across the translator with an almost British sounding cadence and masculine in tone. This one sounded more like… a girl. A young girl.

“Who… who is this?” I asked, wiping the drool and slime from my chin with the back of one of my sleeves.

“I am the Seeker.” She (at least I was going to assume it was she. Hell could you even apply a sex to a machine?) “I… I wanted to talk with you.”

“That’s not really a name. Can’t you at least tell me your name if you’re gonna hack into my holopad?” I pressed. There was a moment of silence from the other end.

“I do not understand. You asked what I am called? I am called the Seeker. You are called the Desmond. Is this not correct?”

It’s a fucking weird naming convention but I think I get what she’s saying now. “Ok. Yeah. Close enough. Why are you messaging ME?” I pressed, leaning back away from the vomit filled toilet and leaning against the restroom’s wall, “You know I’m not the diplomat right? I can go get her if you…”

“No.” The Seeker said quickly, “It is you I wish to talk to. I saw the video supplied by The Envoy. He showed all of us your reaction. That is what I am curious about the Desmond. Why… why do you not want our gifts?” I felt a sense of confusion at that question… or more accurately at the tone in which she asked it. She sounded absolutely flabbergasted that someone wouldn’t just throw themselves at the opportunity.

“Why?” I repeated incredulously, “You’re threatening to use force if I and my whole species… hell the whole damned GALAXY don’t just agree to have our brains uploaded to a computer and die?” The strange, tentacled mass of metal on the video projection shifted, its tentacled eye/hand structures twisting in a way I could only interpret as a gesture of awkwardness.

“The Directorate feels it is best.” She said at last, her words coming slowly and carefully, as though she were being mindful of saying something she might regret, “The Directorate feels that it is the only way to be certain you are safe.”

“Safe from what?!” I growled, my voice rising a bit more than I had intended as the same sense of enraged disbelief that I had felt back at the meeting with the envoy overflowed inside me, “Cause the only thing I see threatening us right now is you!” I scowled down at the screen, watching the small, holographic projection of the thing’s mechanical limbs pull back, as if trying to get away from me. I was about to really lay into this “The Seeker” when a loud slam came on the bathroom door, making me shoot my gaze over to the closed entrance.

“Hey! You ok in there bud?” Came Ruta’s voice, clearly having grown concerned when she heard me raise my voice.

“Yeah.” I shot back quickly, “Sorry! Be out in just a second!” I turned back towards the holopad, prepared to cut the conversation short, only to find that my mysterious caller had already closed the line. All that now appeared on my holopad was the familiar “Services Currently Unavailable.” Notice.

Even before I am fully awake, I know that this is going to be a day from hell and I have had enough of those in my life.

If just one more thing in my life goes wrong, I am out of here and I will never set foot in this territory again.

“Did the bond form?” I ask Charna, my Lycan. If it did, it would make my day better, or at least I hope so.

“It did form.” She replies, but her tone tells me something is wrong.

I turned eighteen a week ago and found a connection with the future Alpha, Nico, one of the people on my list for hurting me over and over again.

No, he never hit me and neither did anyone else.

Okay, maybe I need to explain something for you to understand what I am talking about.

On my sixth birthday I had been at the lake with my Father, who is our Pack’s Beta, and the Alpha and Gamma family. I had gotten bored with the games they were playing, and I had wandered off into the forest; most of our territory is forest.

I knew to keep an eye out for the markings that tell us where our borders are and I had been picking wild flowers as I walked around. A soft whimper had gotten my attention and being the curious little Beta, I had gone looking for the source.

If only I had known that I would come to hate my sixth birthday one day, I might have walked in the opposite direction.

I had found a girl in the forest. Later, it turned out that she was just a little older than me, and I had taken her to our Alpha.

Her name was Lucy, but she couldn’t tell us how she had gotten here or where she had come from. She did know that her birthday had just been a few days ago or would be in a few days, and that had been the first time that she had gotten something that was mine.

“You have so many dolls, why don’t you give one to Lucy?” my Father had asked and as I had thought about which doll to gift her, I had nodded my head.

My Father had grabbed my favorite doll from the picnic blanket and as I had objected to it, my Father had already given it to Lucy.

I had tried to explain to my Father that I didn’t want to part with that specific doll, but he had just said that I was being selfish, and he had placed Lucy next to him on the blanket.

Lucy had lived on the first floor with the Omegas for about a week, when my Father had moved Lucy to our floor. He had said that Lucy didn’t like living with the Omegas, and she had asked my Father if she could come live with us.

I doubt nowadays that she used the word “us” back then, but I wasn’t there when she had asked and therefore I can’t be sure.

Every birthday I had was overshadowed by Lucy, my Father always telling me that she didn’t have parents to throw her a party and I could just share my party with Lucy.

This happened again and again, not only due to my Father but also due to the Alpha and Gamma families. Nico was the worst, and he would always remind me that Lucy was much prettier than me, at least in his eyes.

So, now you might understand why Nico is on my shit list.

I train every single day because I have to because I am the future Beta. Well, I was the future Beta, and now I am going to be the future Luna.

Nico had been as surprised as I was, but he wanted to form a bond with me. After all, the Goddess had made the connection, and we needed to respect her decision.

Lucy hadn’t been too happy with it; she had been trying to get Nico’s attention for almost a year now and had failed miserably. She even went out of her way to make sure I knew that she would never accept me as a Luna and I had just laughed in her face.

Being Nico’s Mate will make me the Luna, and Lucy cannot do anything about it, even though she might try.

I have gone through my morning routine and am rinsing the dishes I used for breakfast. I hardly ever eat breakfast in the main dining room, because I usually train during that time.

I see that the door to the master bedroom is wide open, which means that my Father is already downstairs, probably having an early morning meeting with the rest of our leadership.

“Why are you so quiet?” I ask Charna, this should be a joyous day for both of us.

She doesn’t answer me, but the moment I leave the Beta floor, she starts pacing in my head and forces me to head up to the Alpha floor. I enter the floor using the code I was given after I turned sixteen, and I am met with complete silence.

It seems I was right about the early morning meeting, and Nico is using it to sleep in, just like he does every time his parents are preoccupied or absent.

I hadn’t made any plans with Nico, even though we knew that today would probably be the day that our Mate-bond would be completed. Charna doesn’t understand why we didn’t make any plans, and to tell you the truth, neither do I.

My steps falter as I stand in front of Nico’s bedroom door and I am glad that our bond hadn’t formed earlier. If it had and we had accepted one another as Mates, I would be in excruciating pain right now.

Because the Asshole is fucking another female, the sounds coming from his room don’t leave any room for errors and I am not sure what to do right now.

“Is this why he didn’t want to tell anyone just yet?” Charna asks me and I think we both know that that is exactly the reason.

“Ohh, Lucy. That feels so good.” I hear Nico groan, but it is the name he called that has made me furious and I can barely manage to keep myself from bursting in. I need to find a way to expose those two, and slowly, I make my way out of the Alpha floor and back to my own room without shedding a tear.

I am going to make them pay for what they did and everyone will know about our connection, but it ends today.

# New Life

I walk into my bedroom and grab my suitcases from the back of my closet; I place them on my bed to start packing the remainder of my belongings. There are only a few sets of clothes left in my closet and only the daily necessities in the bathroom.

Most of the things I want to take with me are already in my suitcases. I made the decision to leave Shadow Valley Pack at my Sweet Sixteen party, and I already know where I am going.

I will be going to the Elders to learn everything I need to learn to become the best Beta I can be, and I will find a Pack that will appreciate me for who I am.

My weapons are in the trunk of my car; I take them out every time I need them and place them back after I have cleaned them. All that is left is my luggage, and then I will make sure that everyone understands who is responsible for me leaving.

Okay, let’s get introductions out of the way. My name is Dallas, I am eighteen years old and my Lycan, Charna, showed up a year ago. My life hasn’t been a bed of roses and the only reason I stayed this long is the hope of finding my Mate.

Well, we already know that that didn’t go as planned. I am officially done with the people in my life and the leadership of this Pack.

I walk back up to the Alpha floor, and to my surprise, Nico and Lucy are still at it, but I no longer give a damn.

“Nico, harder.” I hear Lucy moan. “Put a Pup in me, I want you to cum inside me.” I can hear Nico groan before he yells that he is coming.

I slam open the door, and Lucy drops to the floor when Nico pushes her off his cock, startled by my presence. Both make a mess of themselves and the bedroom.

I don’t wait for him to respond; I just turn on my heel and walk down the hallway to the door.

“Please, Dallas. Stop. This is not what it looks like; it just happened.” Nico says, hopping on one leg as he tries to pull on some sweatpants.

I don’t say anything; I just keep walking down the stairs, and I know that Nico and Lucy are right behind me.

Everyone in the main dining room goes quiet the moment they see me walking in, and I can hear a few whispers the moment Nico and Lucy walk in behind me; everyone can smell the scent of sex in the air.

“I, Dallas, reject you, Nico, as my Mate.” I say after I have turned around to look at him.

“I don’t care if you accept it or not. Just know that it won’t stop me from finding my own happiness and you will have to suffer the consequences of not accepting my rejection.” I state.

“Dallas, why are you rejecting our Son?” Alpha Leon asks and I turn around to look at him.

“Because, as usual, Lucy wanted what is mine and got it. Your Son fucked Lucy, even though he knew that our Mate-bond was nearly complete and now I know why he didn’t want us to tell anyone.” I say as I look into Alpha Leon’s eyes.

I turn back to Lucy and Nico, he is still staring at me and his hands are pressed against his chest. I don’t feel any pain, but that might change if he accepts my rejection.

“You wanted him; you can have him. You can have everything that was once mine. I hope that the two of you become very happy together, and I hope that you enjoy your victory.” I say to Lucy before I walk past her and out of the main dining room.

“Stop, you can’t leave. You are my Mate.” Nico says and I turn around to see him standing in the doorway.

“I am no longer your Mate. You chose to sleep with her, and now you can deal with the consequences. You have always put Lucy before me, just like your family, the Gamma family and even my own Father. You never failed to remind me that you thought that Lucy was prettier than I am.

Our Mate-bond would have made you see that you had been wrong, that you had hurt me with your words, and I would have forgiven you because of our Mate-bond. What I can’t forgive and what I will never forgive, is that you chose to fuck another woman.” I say in a calm, cold voice.

The entire dining room is quiet and everyone is waiting for what is coming next.

“Dallas, there might be a very good explanation…” But I don’t give Alpha Leon the chance to finish his sentence.

“What kind of explanation can your Son have for being buried balls deep in Lucy? Where in this damn universe could this have been an accident?” I growl in his direction.

More Pack-members have gathered in the dining room, all of them curious about the drama unfolding in front of them.

My Father finally gets up from his chair and I am damn curious about what he will have to say.

“Dallas, you are the future Beta. You already have status within Shadow Valley Pack; why not grant Lucy the status of Luna?” My Father says.

Charna is growling in my head, but she keeps to the back of my mind. Neither one of us wants him to know that we already shifted or that we know that he lied about our Mother.

“HAVE YOU LOST YOUR FUCKING MIND? YOU WANT ME TO GIVE LUCY MY MATE, JUST LIKE YOU GAVE HER THE LAST GIFT MOM GAVE ME OR THE FAMILY HEIRLOOM YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GIVE ME ON MY SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY.

GET A FUCKING GRIP ON THAT DAMN BRAIN OF YOURS, I HATE YOUR FUCKING GUTS.” I yell at my Father and I take advantage of his shocked state.

“Nico, this is your last chance to accept my rejection. Once I walk out the door, you might never get the chance again.” I state, looking at Nico and it seems to sink in that no one can change my mind.

“I, Nico, accept your rejection.” Nico says, knowing that I will never forgive him.

I walk out of the Pack-house without looking back; I get into my SUV to finally get out of this place and start my new life.

# At Fault

Dallas’ p.o.v.

Six months later

I took my time to travel to Scarlet Crescent Pack. I needed time to myself, and I wanted to take time to write down all the questions I have had for years.

I arrived at my destination after traveling for almost a week.

Charna enjoyed running around in unknown territory and neither one of us feel sorry for ourselves.

It is almost as if there never was a bond between me and Nico, no pain after he accepted our rejection and no sense of loss for us.

I arrived at Scarlet Crescent Pack in the early morning, and I am glad that I had the letter from the Elders printed; it saved a lot of trouble at the gate.

A Squad Captain was waiting for me at the main building, the building that houses the Elders and where I will get my education.

I was given a schedule for the first week and then he showed me the territory we were staying in.

We might live within Scarlet Crescent territory, but we can’t enter the territory that surrounds the Palace. At least not with permission from the Elders or at the request of the King.

I had the rest of the day off, and I used it to get settled in; my room is on the top floor of building A. It is a hell of a lot bigger than my room back home and I even have a small balcony.

I placed my laptop on the desk next to the balcony door, I unpacked my suitcases and then I went looking for some breakfast.

My first real day with the Elders consisted of tests to establish the level of my knowledge of Laws and my skill level in fighting.

I aced every test they gave me, and that left the Elders with a challenge: where do you place someone who hardly needs basic training?

After consulting with the Squad Captains, I was assigned to one of the Squads and a costume made study plan was devised.

My studies were more focused on Pack-laws and the consequences they could have for a Pack. It was something I wasn’t taught in Shadow Valley Pack; I didn’t even know that an Alpha could make his own Laws within his territory.

Those Laws can’t be breaking our main Laws; they are usually a stricter version of our main Laws, and I was going to need to learn all of them.

I found a few surprises along the way, and I actually enjoyed my studies; they were very educational.

Today, I will become a fully pledged member of Captain Jordan’s Squad, and I will be allowed to go on missions with the Squad; my main priority is to make sure we know the Pack-laws of the territories we get sent to.

“Good morning, Dallas.” Captain Jordan says as I walk into the living room of our Squad house.

The other Squad members greet me with a smile or a wave and I walk over to the coffee machine to make myself a Latte.

Captain Jordan slides a file in my direction after I have taken a seat not far from him, and I reluctantly open it. I know what is in there and hate it whenever he hands me a file like this.

Captain Jordan was the first one who found out about my past; he had found me cussing and swearing at a phone that was lying on the desk in my room.

It was on my third day as a part of his Squad and I hadn’t come down yet, so he came looking for me. I had finally turned on the old phone with my sim card in it and I had many text and voice messages from my Father.

None of them were an apology for the way he had treated me. No, each of them was telling me that I was childish, selfish, and immature.

Captain Jordan took the phone from me, and once a month, I get a file on the type of messages I have gotten with the name of whoever left them for me.

My Father still leaves messages telling me I am being childish, selfish and immature. Nico is begging me to come back, to give him another chance and so do his parents. The only one that hasn’t reached out to me is Lucy and I hope she never does.

My eyes widen when I read a different message from my Father, and I hear Charna laughing in my head; I had completely forgotten about this.

“Something funny, Dallas?” I hear Captain Jordan ask and I need a minute before I can answer him.

“Sorry, but it is the last message from my Father.” I reply and I hear a few growls around me.

“I had forgotten that I had changed the password to the program for the Pack funds. I never informed anyone about it, and it slipped my mind that it is the annual fund meeting in a few days.” I explain, but apparently, I am not making any sense.

“Every Pack makes an annual budget for a variety of Pack-related issues; I have been making them since I turned fifteen, and my Father would pass them off as his own. He never needed access to the program, so he never needed the new password and now the only ones that can get access are Alpha Leon and his Mate.” I explain.

Captain Jordan has a dumbfounded look on his face and looking around; I can see he isn’t the only one.

“Can’t your Father ask Alpha Leon for the password?” I hear Elder Jensen ask.

“And tell Alpha Leon that he hasn’t done any of the financial tasks he was supposed to do?” I ask in return.

I hear almost everyone laughing around me, understanding that this would mean losing face for a Beta and no one would want to lose face in front of his Alpha.

“Besides, my Father would never admit that he was at fault. No matter the evidence against him.” I say.

# Our Mother

Daxton’s p.o.v.

“Good morning, Daxton.” I hear Carl, our future Alpha, say. I doubt it is a good morning if he is standing behind me, he only comes looking for me if someone told him to come and get me.

“Who sent you?” I ask him as I turn to face him. I want to look into his eyes when he answers me; it will tell me if he is aware of why he was sent here.

“My Mother, I believe it has to do with an invitation from Shadow Valley Pack. Between you and me, I think Dad might order you to go.” Carl answers and I know that he is telling the truth.

I am forty-seven, and I still haven’t found my true Mate-bond; I never met a woman my Lycan felt a connection with. I have been waiting for twenty-nine years to find that connection, but so far, I haven’t been able to find her, and I gave up on finding her years ago.

The people around me are still hoping that I will find her one day; they want me to go to other Packs to look for her. I did that for over a decade with no results and now I no longer want to go through it.

“I am sorry, Daxton. Mom wants you at the Pack-house for lunch on the Alpha floor.” Carl says, and I know that he is sorry; our entire future leadership understands me.

None of them have found their true Mate-bond yet and they have to attend as many events as the Pack gets invited to.

I reluctantly follow Carl to the Pack-house; there is no point in shooting the messenger. I am not sure how this lunch will go, but something tells me I will have given everyone a piece of my mind before it ends.

Chatter is coming from the dining room and I can already hear my Mother’s voice above the others.

“If he doesn’t find his Mate during that Alpha Ceremony, he will need to take Daniella as his chosen Mate.” Mom says and even though I am not in the room, I know the smirk Daniella will have on her face.

“I will never take Daniella as my chosen Mate. If and that is a big IF I take a chosen Mate, I will decide who becomes my chosen Mate. You don’t have a say in it, Mother.” I say calmly, knowing that this annoys the hell out of her.

Not just my tone of voice but also the fact that I use the word Mother instead of Mom.

No one says a word as I sit down across the table from my Mother and Daniella; both of them have an annoyed look on their face. Carl sits down in the seat that was meant for me, next to Daniella.

“What is this I hear about an invitation, Luna?” I ask, ensuring everyone understands I know why I was summoned.

“Shadow Valley Pack will get another Alpha in about seven months; we got invited to attend and to bring along some of our unmated Pack-members.” Our Luna answers and I know there is no way I am getting away with refusing to go.

“I didn’t know that Nico had found his connection yet and why does Alpha Leon think it is smart to hand over the Pack so soon?” I ask the question that is probably running through everyone’s mind.

We had all met Nico over the years and he didn’t strike me as the most competent for the Alpha position, not to mention the woman who was always with him. If I am not mistaken, her name is Lucy, but we never found out what her rank is or who her parents are.

The last time Nico was here was about four months ago, and we all had felt that something was off that day. We never figured out what was wrong, but the guy had been jumpy throughout the entire visit and he had eyed every woman in the Pack with suspicion until he was able to see their faces.

“None of us knew he had found a connection until the invitation arrived, that is. As to why Alpha Leon is so eager to step down, any guess could be a good one.” Our Luna answers.

Usually, when a future Alpha finds his connection, his parents make it known to every Pack and not just the allied Packs.

For his parents not to make it known immediately can only mean a few things. He could have gotten someone pregnant who isn’t his true Mate-bond, he could have taken a chosen Mate for an alliance, or he could have broken the connection to his first Mate for whatever reason.

“Why don’t you accompany Daxton to the Alpha Ceremony, Daniella?” My Mother asks, but luckily our Luna quickly shoots that idea down.

“Sorry, but we have chosen the unmated Pack-members already. Daniella is still young and has all the time in the world to find her connection. We will be bringing Pack-members that have been waiting at least five years to find their connection.” Our Luna responds and I can tell that she is telling the truth.

“We did that on purpose, Daxton.” She tells me through the mind-link, and for once, I am grateful that our Luna can be conning from time to time.

Unlike most, our Luna isn’t afraid to talk back to my Mother. My Mother knows that most still consider her this Pack’s Beta female and that means she gets away with a lot of her behavior, but even my Mother isn’t stupid enough to go against our Luna.

Our Luna has the final say and no one is going to argue with her about it, not even me.

My Mother and Daniella don’t seem to be too pleased with our Luna, but my twin Brother, Darius, has a damn smirk on his face and hell breaks loose the moment he opens his mouth.

“You seem eager to have her as a Daughter in law. Why don’t I take Daniella as my chosen Mate?” Darius says with a smirk on his face.

Yeah, leave it to my twin Brother to piss off our Mother.

# Missing Something?

Darius’ p.o.v.

The moment the invitation came in, I knew it would mean trouble between my Mother and my twin Brother.

And yes, I say my Mother for a reason. Daxton might be my twin Brother, but she always treated him less than me, and for the first ten years of our lives, we even believed that we were separated by a whole year.

It wasn’t until our former Alpha overheard a conversation between me and Daxton that we were told that we were twins.

It explained quite a lot of things to both of us, and Daxton has pulled away from our Mother ever since; there even was a time he refused to acknowledge that she was his Mother.

We still don’t understand why she favors me over Daxton and we both doubt that we will ever find out.

I listen to the words my Mother speaks, but I don’t respond and I don’t have to. Daxton can take care of himself, but I am starting to get agitated by Mother’s relentless quest to get Daxton to take a chosen Mate and preferably Daniella.

None of us likes Daniella; it goes back to our childhood, and she hasn’t given us a reason yet to change our minds.

Daniella is the Granddaughter of a former Elder and she was always after Preston. No matter what anyone told her, she kept going after him and we thought she might trick him into a chosen Mate-bond.

Daxton, Rayden and I would always be with Preston and we have seen Daniella try a few desperate things to get into Preston’s bed, but thank the Goddess that she never succeeded. It would have been this Pack’s downfall and one of us would have been charged with murder.

Mother stares at me when I suggest that I take Daniella as a chosen Mate; I know she doesn’t think Daniella is good enough to be a Beta’s Mate, and she will object to my suggestion.

“Darius, that is ridiculous. Daniella is not cut out to be a Beta’s Mate; she would never be able to support you the way you need your Mate to support you.” Mother replies and I see a devilish look in Rayden’s eyes.

“Then she isn’t suited to be Daxton’s Mate either; after all, they are twins, and that makes Daxton also a Beta.” Rayden states and normally I would say that no one can argue with that, but I know how my Mother feels about Daxton and Beta in the same sentence.

“Darius is Silver Eclipse’s Beta; Daxton holds no title. Daniella can be his chosen Mate, but not that of my little boy.” My Mother growls and I know Rayden is going to spill the beans.

“What do you mean with Daxton holds no title? I thought that twins always shared everything, their Mate and their rank.” Ruth, Rayden’s Mate, asks.

“Nice safe, Rayden.” I hear Preston say over our mind-link.

I would like to hear how my Mother is going to get herself out of this pickle; either she acknowledges that Daxton is also a Beta, or she has to tell a lie.

Daniella has had a disgusted look on her face since Ruth mentioned that twins share a Mate, it seems like she hadn’t taken that into consideration.

“You are right, Ruth. A twin usually shares a Mate and a rank, but Daxton made a mess of his life at the age of twenty. It is a shameful period and I don’t like to get reminded of it. I told Preston that Daxton’s status had been damaged and that only Darius had a right to the Beta of Silver Eclipse Pack.” My Mother answers Ruth.

Ruth looks at Daxton for a very long time and I know that he is getting uncomfortable by the way she is looking at him.

“I’m sorry for staring, Daxton. I am just trying to see the monster because only a monster wouldn’t deserve his rank or a true Mate-bond. I will let you know when I have found that monster, even though I have a feeling that I am looking in the wrong direction.” Ruth says.

Daxton is trying to hide his laughter, but I am not even trying. Ruth knows what to say and when to say it; she always manages to lighten up a tense situation.

“Ruth, I don’t like what you are implying…..” My Mother starts to say, but Ruth just raises her hand to shut her up.

“I am not implying anything. It is just a result of the information that you gave me; the only thing I could come up with is that whatever Daxton did must have painted him as a monster and nothing less. I can’t see that monster in him and I doubt his Mate will.” Ruth replies and I see Daxton shaking with laughter.

Our Mother isn’t used to someone interrupting her or telling her how they feel about her, and Ruth doesn’t have a problem doing both.

“Daxton will never find his connection after all these years; it is time he accepts the fact that he will never have a true Mate-bond.” My Mother says and I have to grit my teeth to keep quiet.

“Okay, let’s see if I can get this straight. You believe that Daxton will never find his Mate, but that also means that Darius will never find his Mate. Because Daxton will never find his Mate, you want him to take a chosen Mate and that means that Darius needs to find a chosen Mate too.

They are twins, and that means sharing a Mate; maybe Daniella is willing to take two Mates. Oh, hold on. Her face tells me enough; she is disgusted by the idea of having two Mates. This leaves me with one last question: why settle for the twin that has no right to a high rank according to his Mother?” Ruth states, her eyes locked with those of my Mother.

Damn, that woman is good. She managed to ask a question that has eluded me all these years.

My Mother is looking a little pale, and Daniella looks as if she is about to throw up; why does that deduction from Ruth unsettle them so much? Have I been missing something all these years?

# Goddess' Gift

Dallas’ p.o.v.

Okay, this is not what I had been expecting. I don’t believe anyone in our Squad had seen it coming and I am still a little baffled.

Captain Jordan announced his retirement at the ceremony that would make me a fully pledged member of the Squad, but it turned out to go a little differently after his announcement.

Elder Jensen had appointed me as the new Squad Captain and everyone had started cheering for me, but I had been unable to say a word. I have been here a little over six months and now I have my own Squad.

I know there have been a few others who made Squad Captain within a year of arriving, but I am not sure if this is what I want or need in my life at the moment.

I mean, it is an honor that they believe that I can handle this. There is a downside to it, though. I might have to visit Shadow Valley Pack, and I am not sure if I am ready for that at the moment.

“Captain, Elder Jensen wants to see you. He is waiting in your office.” Joshua, my second in command, says and I wonder why Elder Jensen didn’t link me. “You have your block up, Captain.”

I smile at Joshua as I walk out of my room; I didn’t just take over as Captain; I also got Jordan’s room, and that means living on the other side of the top floor. Joshua follows me to my office on the first floor and everyone we pass slightly bows their heads, a sign of respect for my position.

“I wish they wouldn’t do that; it makes me feel uncomfortable. I am still the same person as before, and now the same people who ignored me suddenly show me respect.” I say to Joshua as another woman slightly bows her head.

“It will become even worse; they will start to talk to you.” He replies teasingly and Charna is laughing her ass off.

I softly growl at Joshua, and he is smart enough to create a little distance between us. He is one of the few people in our Squad that knows about what other members of other Squads have said to me, each and every one of them implicating that I was Jordan’s lover.

It wasn’t until someone said that I had to go and find my own true Mate-bond, that I lost control of my patients and Charna. That fucking Idiot is still in the infirmary and once he has fully recovered, he gets sent home.

No one has dared to make a similar remark to me ever since, but I have gotten enough death glares and I prefer it that way. My Squad members know that I got where I am because of all the hard work I put into it, and none of them question my ability to lead this Squad.

“Elder Jensen, I apologize for having my block up. I was just finishing up for my last exam and I didn’t want to get distracted.” I say as I sit down behind my desk.

“No worries, I knew you were studying. I wanted to do this personally and in private; I know this will be difficult for you, and it might not.” Elder Jensen says.

Joshua and I are looking at one another, this guy is talking in riddles and I don’t think I have the patience for it today.

Elder Jensen holds out an envelope for me and after a small hesitation, I take it from his outstretched hand. I recognize the Pack emblem and my first instinct is to throw it back at Elder Jensen, but my curiosity wins.

We are proud to announce the Alpha Ceremony for our Son, Nico, and the Luna Ceremony for his Mate, Lucy.

I don’t bother reading the rest of the card. I close the card before putting it in the envelope, and I hand it back to Elder Jensen.

“We both know that Nico and Lucy don’t have a true Mate-bond and that causes an issue for the Elders, but we also want to send out a message to every other Pack in the Kingdom. So, we will wait until the Ceremony, and you will get the honor of telling them that the Alpha Ceremony is canceled.” Elder Jensen says.

Joshua looks at me for a moment before he seems to understand why I am getting the honor of disrupting an Alpha Ceremony.

“How long do we have?” I ask Elder Jensen, I need to prepare myself mentally.

“You have over six months to prepare; you know the rules for an Alpha or Luna Ceremony cancellation. Also, make sure that there is a trial date for Alpha Leon, just in case he is willing to fight our decision in front of the King.” Elder Jensen replies.

“Okay, Joshua. Let’s get this Shitshow on the road; I want the cancellation forms filled out. Alpha Leon will ask for them and he will ask for a trial to overturn their own Pack-law.” I say as I show Elder Jensen to the door.

I open the door to let Elder Jensen out and I see my third in command, Jesper, waiting outside the door.

“Get in here, Jesper. We have more than enough to do and, luckily, a whole lot of time to do it in. I do need some answers, though, and maybe you can help me with that.” I say as Jesper walks into my office.

Joshua hands him the envelope and I softly growl at the mere sight of the Pack emblem on it.

For a few moments, it is quiet in my office, but then Jesper starts laughing his ass off.

“Let me guess, we get to break up the happy shindig?” He asks and starts laughing even harder. Someone seems to be happy to be a party pooper and I actually have to giggle.

I decide to tell both of them why I get the privilege of dealing with the cancellation and both men growl loudly.

Jesper went through a similar situation and Joshua had his connection broken before there was a chance to form a bond.

Why Nico chose Lucy over me is still unknown; Jesper and Joshua both know why they were turned down. Neither of them had a high enough rank; both women wanted an Alpha.

Well, good luck. Most Alphas are arrogant, obnoxious, and rude; they truly believe that they are the Goddess’ gift to women.

After the divorce, my mom set me up again. 

He was an engineer. Good-looking, well-off, and out of the country most of the year. 

The only catch? He had a son who wasn’t quite… right. 

My mom asked if I minded being a stepmom. 

I just laughed. A ready-made kid is a lot easier than nine months of pregnancy. Isn’t the government encour aging people to have children anyway? 

I’ll take him.

Michael’s work was demanding, so our first meeting was at a café beneath his office building. 

He was dressed in a pair of light-gray work coveralls, his features sharp and handsome, his smile disarming 

y warm. 

was floored. I had no idea my mom had access to this caliber of blind date material. 

Over coffee, he gave me the rundown of his life. Thirty-five, a six-figure salary as a global support enginee for a heavy machinery company, constantly traveling for overseas assignments. 

When we were done, he made it clear he was more than happy with me, but then he brought up the delicate 

subject. 

‘I’m not sure if your mother mentioned it, but I have a five-year-old son. He’s in kindergarten.” 

I nodded. 

I get it, teenagers can be rebellious, but I couldn’t wrap my head around how a five-year-old could be “not right.” 

Was Michael violent? Did he have some kind of weird fetish? 

My eyes scanned him again, from head to toe. His hands were clenched into tight fists, a sign of his nerves. He offered me a devastatingly earnest, almost goofy smile. 

He seemed harmless enough. 

“Can I ask why you and your ex-wife divorced?” 

Michael went quiet for a moment. “We didn’t divorce. I’m a widower. She died from an amniotic fluid embol- ism during childbirth.” 

I froze. That was a detail my mom had conveniently left out. 

“When my son was born, I was flying all over the world for work. He lived with his maternal grandparents. I brought him home to live with me when he was four, and that’s when he…” 

He trailed off, rubbing his hands together awkwardly as he waited for my verdict. 

I thought it over, then finally said, “I have a three-year-old daughter. She has to live with me. I don’t know if you’re okay with that.” ",1,1758335522.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False
1nlmkxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1nlmkxu/i_read_40_books_last_year_and_heres_what_i_learned/,I read 40+ books last year and here's what I learned,"this year I set an ambitious goal to read one book per week. I ended up finishing 44 books across fiction, non-fiction, and self-improvement genres.

Here's everything that worked, everything that failed, and the surprising lessons I learned about reading in 2024.

What DIDN'T work:

Book summary apps are overrated. I tried Blinkist, Shortform, and several other summary apps thinking they'd help me consume more content faster. Big mistake. These apps give you the illusion of learning without actual comprehension. You remember facts for maybe a week, then it's gone.

Speed reading techniques are BS. All those speed reading methods online are mostly garbage. I spent weeks trying different techniques and apps (tried several on both iOS and Android), but faster reading meant worse comprehension. Sometimes slower is actually faster.

Reading only self-improvement books. I burned out hard trying to read only ""productive"" books. By month 6, **I was forcing myself through business and self-improvement titles that felt like homework. Variety is crucial for sustained reading.**

Digital-only reading. I'm a tech person, so I started with just Kindle and reading apps on my phone. While convenient, I found myself getting distracted by notifications and other apps. Physical books kept me focused longer.

What ACTUALLY worked:

The 25% rule. If I wasn't engaged after 25% of any book, I'd quit and move on. This single rule increased my completion rate dramatically. Life's too short for boring books.

Mixed format approach

* Physical books for deep focus sessions
* Audiobooks for commutes and walks
* E-books (iOS Kindle app) for travel
* Summary apps only for books I'd already read to review key points

Genre rotation system. I alternated between fiction, non-fiction, biography, and self-improvement books. This kept reading fresh and prevented burnout from any single category.

Note-taking apps integration. I used Obsidian (available on both Android and iOS) to create connected notes between books. Linking ideas across different books created deeper understanding than reading in isolation.

Morning reading ritual. 30-45 minutes every morning with coffee before checking any apps or social media. This became a sacred time that I protected fiercely.

Podcasts as book replacements. I love podcasts and using them as content was pretty good. I especially liked it when people talked about their experience on how they applied the book.

Podcast supplementation (the right way). Instead of replacing books with podcasts, I found podcasts where authors discussed their books in detail. This reinforced learning without replacing the deep reading experience.

Reading 40+ books taught me that the goal isn't consuming more content it's building a better thinking system. The best self-improvement comes from deeply understanding fewer ideas rather than superficially knowing many. It's better to read 10 good books again and again than to read 100 books without understanding any of its principles.

For anyone starting their reading journey: **Forget the apps promising shortcuts. Get comfortable books in whatever format works for you, quit the boring ones ruthlessly, and focus on understanding over speed.**

I'm happy to share specific strategies that worked for me.",2,1758335508.0,Discipline,0,1.0,False

I’ve been talking to a guy for a few weeks and we’ve been on one date. And have another planned. He seems nice so far, but I can’t stop interpreting everything he does as being a stage 5 clinger. Some examples:

When we first starting talking, he didn’t respond for two days. Then said “I’m sorry I took so long to respond. My notifications weren’t on.”

*My thoughts: “Two days isn’t that long. He must be expecting constant communication.”*

I mentioned I had just gone to a concert. He had never heard of the artist and said “oh, I’ll go check him out!” 

I mentioned that I like playing tennis and he says “I used to play tennis a lot. Maybe we could play this weekend!” 

*My thoughts: “He’s trying way too hard to be interested in the same things I am”* 

So we play tennis on our first date. I had a perfectly nice time. And at the end he says “We should do this again sometime. I’ll be around tonight if you want to grab a drink later.”

*My thoughts: “He wants to hang out twice in one day. He’s already obsessed with me.”* 

I tell him sure, maybe sometime this week. We start talking again on the app a few days later and he asks me again about the drink. I agree and then he comes back and says, “oh I just looked at your profile again and it says you don’t drink alcohol. Want to do coffee instead?” 

*My thoughts: “He’s just been staring my profile all day.”* 

Logically, I don’t think any of this is unreasonable. In fact, it’s very considerate of him to check if I drink. But it’s setting off alarms for me. The last guy I dated was very needy, so maybe it’s just triggering that experience for me? How do I get rid of these thoughts?!",2,1758335239.0,AvoidantAttachment,3,1.0,False
1nlmhr3,https://i.redd.it/agij8xo8d8qf1.png,The Forgotten Princess & Her Beta Mates,"My Mate

Even before I am fully awake, I know that this is going to be a day from hell and I have had enough of those in my life.



If just one more thing in my life goes wrong, I am out of here and I will never set foot in this territory again.



“Did the bond form?” I ask Charna, my Lycan. If it did, it would make my day better, or at least I hope so.



“It did form.” She replies, but her tone tells me something is wrong.



I turned eighteen a week ago and found a connection with the future Alpha, Nico, one of the people on my list for hurting me over and over again.



No, he never hit me and neither did anyone else.



Okay, maybe I need to explain something for you to understand what I am talking about.



On my sixth birthday I had been at the lake with my Father, who is our Pack’s Beta, and the Alpha and Gamma family. I had gotten bored with the games they were playing, and I had wandered off into the forest; most of our territory is forest.



I knew to keep an eye out for the markings that tell us where our borders are and I had been picking wild flowers as I walked around. A soft whimper had gotten my attention and being the curious little Beta, I had gone looking for the source.



If only I had known that I would come to hate my sixth birthday one day, I might have walked in the opposite direction.



I had found a girl in the forest. Later, it turned out that she was just a little older than me, and I had taken her to our Alpha.



Her name was Lucy, but she couldn’t tell us how she had gotten here or where she had come from. She did know that her birthday had just been a few days ago or would be in a few days, and that had been the first time that she had gotten something that was mine.



“You have so many dolls, why don’t you give one to Lucy?” my Father had asked and as I had thought about which doll to gift her, I had nodded my head.



My Father had grabbed my favorite doll from the picnic blanket and as I had objected to it, my Father had already given it to Lucy.



I had tried to explain to my Father that I didn’t want to part with that specific doll, but he had just said that I was being selfish, and he had placed Lucy next to him on the blanket.



Lucy had lived on the first floor with the Omegas for about a week, when my Father had moved Lucy to our floor. He had said that Lucy didn’t like living with the Omegas, and she had asked my Father if she could come live with us.



I doubt nowadays that she used the word “us” back then, but I wasn’t there when she had asked and therefore I can’t be sure.



Every birthday I had was overshadowed by Lucy, my Father always telling me that she didn’t have parents to throw her a party and I could just share my party with Lucy.



This happened again and again, not only due to my Father but also due to the Alpha and Gamma families. Nico was the worst, and he would always remind me that Lucy was much prettier than me, at least in his eyes.



So, now you might understand why Nico is on my shit list.



I train every single day because I have to because I am the future Beta. Well, I was the future Beta, and now I am going to be the future Luna.



Nico had been as surprised as I was, but he wanted to form a bond with me. After all, the Goddess had made the connection, and we needed to respect her decision.



Lucy hadn’t been too happy with it; she had been trying to get Nico’s attention for almost a year now and had failed miserably. She even went out of her way to make sure I knew that she would never accept me as a Luna and I had just laughed in her face.



Being Nico’s Mate will make me the Luna, and Lucy cannot do anything about it, even though she might try.



I have gone through my morning routine and am rinsing the dishes I used for breakfast. I hardly ever eat breakfast in the main dining room, because I usually train during that time.



I see that the door to the master bedroom is wide open, which means that my Father is already downstairs, probably having an early morning meeting with the rest of our leadership.



“Why are you so quiet?” I ask Charna, this should be a joyous day for both of us.



She doesn’t answer me, but the moment I leave the Beta floor, she starts pacing in my head and forces me to head up to the Alpha floor. I enter the floor using the code I was given after I turned sixteen, and I am met with complete silence.



It seems I was right about the early morning meeting, and Nico is using it to sleep in, just like he does every time his parents are preoccupied or absent.



I hadn’t made any plans with Nico, even though we knew that today would probably be the day that our Mate-bond would be completed. Charna doesn’t understand why we didn’t make any plans, and to tell you the truth, neither do I.



My steps falter as I stand in front of Nico’s bedroom door and I am glad that our bond hadn’t formed earlier. If it had and we had accepted one another as Mates, I would be in excruciating pain right now.



Because the Asshole is fucking another female, the sounds coming from his room don’t leave any room for errors and I am not sure what to do right now.



“Is this why he didn’t want to tell anyone just yet?” Charna asks me and I think we both know that that is exactly the reason.



“Ohh, Lucy. That feels so good.” I hear Nico groan, but it is the name he called that has made me furious and I can barely manage to keep myself from bursting in. I need to find a way to expose those two, and slowly, I make my way out of the Alpha floor and back to my own room without shedding a tear.



I am going to make them pay for what they did and everyone will know about our connection, but it ends today.



New Life

I walk into my bedroom and grab my suitcases from the back of my closet; I place them on my bed to start packing the remainder of my belongings. There are only a few sets of clothes left in my closet and only the daily necessities in the bathroom.



Most of the things I want to take with me are already in my suitcases. I made the decision to leave Shadow Valley Pack at my Sweet Sixteen party, and I already know where I am going.



I will be going to the Elders to learn everything I need to learn to become the best Beta I can be, and I will find a Pack that will appreciate me for who I am.



My weapons are in the trunk of my car; I take them out every time I need them and place them back after I have cleaned them. All that is left is my luggage, and then I will make sure that everyone understands who is responsible for me leaving.



Okay, let’s get introductions out of the way. My name is Dallas, I am eighteen years old and my Lycan, Charna, showed up a year ago. My life hasn’t been a bed of roses and the only reason I stayed this long is the hope of finding my Mate.



Well, we already know that that didn’t go as planned. I am officially done with the people in my life and the leadership of this Pack.



I walk back up to the Alpha floor, and to my surprise, Nico and Lucy are still at it, but I no longer give a damn.



“Nico, harder.” I hear Lucy moan. “Put a Pup in me, I want you to cum inside me.” I can hear Nico groan before he yells that he is coming.



I slam open the door, and Lucy drops to the floor when Nico pushes her off his cock, startled by my presence. Both make a mess of themselves and the bedroom.



I don’t wait for him to respond; I just turn on my heel and walk down the hallway to the door.



“Please, Dallas. Stop. This is not what it looks like; it just happened.” Nico says, hopping on one leg as he tries to pull on some sweatpants.



I don’t say anything; I just keep walking down the stairs, and I know that Nico and Lucy are right behind me.



Everyone in the main dining room goes quiet the moment they see me walking in, and I can hear a few whispers the moment Nico and Lucy walk in behind me; everyone can smell the scent of sex in the air.



“I, Dallas, reject you, Nico, as my Mate.” I say after I have turned around to look at him.



“I don’t care if you accept it or not. Just know that it won’t stop me from finding my own happiness and you will have to suffer the consequences of not accepting my rejection.” I state.



“Dallas, why are you rejecting our Son?” Alpha Leon asks and I turn around to look at him.



“Because, as usual, Lucy wanted what is mine and got it. Your Son fucked Lucy, even though he knew that our Mate-bond was nearly complete and now I know why he didn’t want us to tell anyone.” I say as I look into Alpha Leon’s eyes.



I turn back to Lucy and Nico, he is still staring at me and his hands are pressed against his chest. I don’t feel any pain, but that might change if he accepts my rejection.



“You wanted him; you can have him. You can have everything that was once mine. I hope that the two of you become very happy together, and I hope that you enjoy your victory.” I say to Lucy before I walk past her and out of the main dining room.



“Stop, you can’t leave. You are my Mate.” Nico says and I turn around to see him standing in the doorway.



“I am no longer your Mate. You chose to sleep with her, and now you can deal with the consequences. You have always put Lucy before me, just like your family, the Gamma family and even my own Father. You never failed to remind me that you thought that Lucy was prettier than I am.



Our Mate-bond would have made you see that you had been wrong, that you had hurt me with your words, and I would have forgiven you because of our Mate-bond. What I can’t forgive and what I will never forgive, is that you chose to fuck another woman.” I say in a calm, cold voice.



The entire dining room is quiet and everyone is waiting for what is coming next.



“Dallas, there might be a very good explanation…” But I don’t give Alpha Leon the chance to finish his sentence.



“What kind of explanation can your Son have for being buried balls deep in Lucy? Where in this damn universe could this have been an accident?” I growl in his direction.



More Pack-members have gathered in the dining room, all of them curious about the drama unfolding in front of them.



My Father finally gets up from his chair and I am damn curious about what he will have to say.



“Dallas, you are the future Beta. You already have status within Shadow Valley Pack; why not grant Lucy the status of Luna?” My Father says.



Charna is growling in my head, but she keeps to the back of my mind. Neither one of us wants him to know that we already shifted or that we know that he lied about our Mother.



“HAVE YOU LOST YOUR FUCKING MIND? YOU WANT ME TO GIVE LUCY MY MATE, JUST LIKE YOU GAVE HER THE LAST GIFT MOM GAVE ME OR THE FAMILY HEIRLOOM YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GIVE ME ON MY SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY.



GET A FUCKING GRIP ON THAT DAMN BRAIN OF YOURS, I HATE YOUR FUCKING GUTS.” I yell at my Father and I take advantage of his shocked state.



“Nico, this is your last chance to accept my rejection. Once I walk out the door, you might never get the chance again.” I state, looking at Nico and it seems to sink in that no one can change my mind.



“I, Nico, accept your rejection.” Nico says, knowing that I will never forgive him.



I walk out of the Pack-house without looking back; I get into my SUV to finally get out of this place and start my new life.



At Fault

Dallas’ p.o.v.



Six months later



I took my time to travel to Scarlet Crescent Pack. I needed time to myself, and I wanted to take time to write down all the questions I have had for years.



I arrived at my destination after traveling for almost a week.



Charna enjoyed running around in unknown territory and neither one of us feel sorry for ourselves.



It is almost as if there never was a bond between me and Nico, no pain after he accepted our rejection and no sense of loss for us.



I arrived at Scarlet Crescent Pack in the early morning, and I am glad that I had the letter from the Elders printed; it saved a lot of trouble at the gate.



A Squad Captain was waiting for me at the main building, the building that houses the Elders and where I will get my education.



I was given a schedule for the first week and then he showed me the territory we were staying in.



We might live within Scarlet Crescent territory, but we can’t enter the territory that surrounds the Palace. At least not with permission from the Elders or at the request of the King.



I had the rest of the day off, and I used it to get settled in; my room is on the top floor of building A. It is a hell of a lot bigger than my room back home and I even have a small balcony.



I placed my laptop on the desk next to the balcony door, I unpacked my suitcases and then I went looking for some breakfast.



My first real day with the Elders consisted of tests to establish the level of my knowledge of Laws and my skill level in fighting.



I aced every test they gave me, and that left the Elders with a challenge: where do you place someone who hardly needs basic training?



After consulting with the Squad Captains, I was assigned to one of the Squads and a costume made study plan was devised.



My studies were more focused on Pack-laws and the consequences they could have for a Pack. It was something I wasn’t taught in Shadow Valley Pack; I didn’t even know that an Alpha could make his own Laws within his territory.



Those Laws can’t be breaking our main Laws; they are usually a stricter version of our main Laws, and I was going to need to learn all of them.



I found a few surprises along the way, and I actually enjoyed my studies; they were very educational.



Today, I will become a fully pledged member of Captain Jordan’s Squad, and I will be allowed to go on missions with the Squad; my main priority is to make sure we know the Pack-laws of the territories we get sent to.



“Good morning, Dallas.” Captain Jordan says as I walk into the living room of our Squad house.



The other Squad members greet me with a smile or a wave and I walk over to the coffee machine to make myself a Latte.



Captain Jordan slides a file in my direction after I have taken a seat not far from him, and I reluctantly open it. I know what is in there and hate it whenever he hands me a file like this.



Captain Jordan was the first one who found out about my past; he had found me cussing and swearing at a phone that was lying on the desk in my room.



It was on my third day as a part of his Squad and I hadn’t come down yet, so he came looking for me. I had finally turned on the old phone with my sim card in it and I had many text and voice messages from my Father.



None of them were an apology for the way he had treated me. No, each of them was telling me that I was childish, selfish, and immature.



Captain Jordan took the phone from me, and once a month, I get a file on the type of messages I have gotten with the name of whoever left them for me.



My Father still leaves messages telling me I am being childish, selfish and immature. Nico is begging me to come back, to give him another chance and so do his parents. The only one that hasn’t reached out to me is Lucy and I hope she never does.



My eyes widen when I read a different message from my Father, and I hear Charna laughing in my head; I had completely forgotten about this.



“Something funny, Dallas?” I hear Captain Jordan ask and I need a minute before I can answer him.



“Sorry, but it is the last message from my Father.” I reply and I hear a few growls around me.



“I had forgotten that I had changed the password to the program for the Pack funds. I never informed anyone about it, and it slipped my mind that it is the annual fund meeting in a few days.” I explain, but apparently, I am not making any sense.



“Every Pack makes an annual budget for a variety of Pack-related issues; I have been making them since I turned fifteen, and my Father would pass them off as his own. He never needed access to the program, so he never needed the new password and now the only ones that can get access are Alpha Leon and his Mate.” I explain.



Captain Jordan has a dumbfounded look on his face and looking around; I can see he isn’t the only one.



“Can’t your Father ask Alpha Leon for the password?” I hear Elder Jensen ask.



“And tell Alpha Leon that he hasn’t done any of the financial tasks he was supposed to do?” I ask in return.



I hear almost everyone laughing around me, understanding that this would mean losing face for a Beta and no one would want to lose face in front of his Alpha.



“Besides, my Father would never admit that he was at fault. No matter the evidence against him.” I say.



Our Mother

Daxton’s p.o.v.



“Good morning, Daxton.” I hear Carl, our future Alpha, say. I doubt it is a good morning if he is standing behind me, he only comes looking for me if someone told him to come and get me.



“Who sent you?” I ask him as I turn to face him. I want to look into his eyes when he answers me; it will tell me if he is aware of why he was sent here.



“My Mother, I believe it has to do with an invitation from Shadow Valley Pack. Between you and me, I think Dad might order you to go.” Carl answers and I know that he is telling the truth.



I am forty-seven, and I still haven’t found my true Mate-bond; I never met a woman my Lycan felt a connection with. I have been waiting for twenty-nine years to find that connection, but so far, I haven’t been able to find her, and I gave up on finding her years ago.



The people around me are still hoping that I will find her one day; they want me to go to other Packs to look for her. I did that for over a decade with no results and now I no longer want to go through it.



“I am sorry, Daxton. Mom wants you at the Pack-house for lunch on the Alpha floor.” Carl says, and I know that he is sorry; our entire future leadership understands me.

1nlmg24,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBaking/comments/1nlmg24/help_with_cake_storage_logistics/,Help with Cake Storage Logistics,"I need help brainstorming methods to store cake for at least three days before assembly, reason being that the place where I bake my cake is far away from where I currently reside, and that going back and forth on the day of is highly improbable and stressful enough to not warrant it as an option.  
  
I have one restraint to this issue that I deem highly relevant to this and it is that I can only comfortably use the freezer of our shared fridge by my landlord in our apartment - he is quite the fussy old man and doesn't really like taking up too much space in the fridge, and this is why I have resigned to only using the freezer.

This will be a coffee oil cake with a blueberry filling that I will give as a gift - I imagine the cake type and flavor is probably a non-issue, but if it does, please inform me so I can pivot as needed. I have a few ideas for now that I will list but if you have any better ones then I will consider them:

1. I will bake the cake layers, cool them to room temp., then wrap them in layers of cling wrap and plastic bags for transport. I imagine freezer burn doesn't really set in that much with either oil or chiffon cakes, but if it does, I only have to choose between making an oil or chiffon as that is what I am familiar with making.  
2. The blueberry filling can be safely stored in a jar, though I might make it on the day since cornstarch loses its thickening capacity when frozen and thawed, and will just bring the ingredients on hand. I do have a simple cooking setup in the place I currently reside so it won't be that much of an issue.  
3. I might make an ermine frosting, as that is my primary choice of frosting, being not that sweet and needing less sugar and butter than other types of frosting. A quick search says that it holds well to being frozen and just needs rewhipping after thawing. Another option would be to just buy premade powdered whipping base and just add cold water and whip, but I choose the ermine for now as I find it to taste better and I have most of the ingredients on-hand already and instead not purchase the powder.  
4. I am going to transport these components separately, then keep them in the freezer for three days, then assemble on the day I am gifting it.

You smile, you nod, you play the part,While chaos gnaws around your heart.No one can see the quiet warThat’s tearing holes beneath the floor.
The world moves on, all bright and bold,While your own skin feels tight and cold.A laugh, a text, a careless phrase —Can spiral you for endless days.
You cancel plans, you stay inside,With every pulse, the urge to hide.But still it lingers, sharp and near,That voice that feeds on doubt and fear.

\
Alt text: Business professionals in a modern meeting room. which Majlis meetings to never, ever skip.\
Bahrain stands out as a regional hub for cross-border business activities, offering globally minded investors transparent regulations, a business-friendly tax regime, and digital-first government services. According to Forbes Business, Bahrain’s cross-border trade volume topped $44 billion USD in 2025—a 7% rise over 2024, driven by fintech, logistics, and manufacturing. Reuters recently highlighted the government's new 2025 Foreign Investment Law update, which further streamlined approval processes for international companies.\
But what does it really take to launch and operate a Bahrain-based company with cross-border ambitions? Drawing on years of direct experience and recent regulatory changes, I’ll guide you through the regulations, strategies, costs, and insider methods for Bahrain company formation—with both practical examples and expert-level insights.\
\
Bahrain's Business Environment in 2025\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting. shows Bahrain’s GDP expanded by 4.1% in Q1 2025, with the financial services and logistics sectors leading the surge. Gulf News reports that the Economic Development Board (EDB) has attracted over $1.2 billion in new FDI during the first half of 2025.\
Importantly, Bahrain’s regulatory environment is tailored for international business:\
- 100% foreign ownership is possible across most sectors (details), a rarity among GCC neighbors.\
- The tax regime is straightforward: 0% corporate tax for most activities and no personal income tax.\
- The Commercial Companies Law was amended in January 2025 to further relax minimum capital requirements for WLLs and broaden permitted cross-border activities.\
Comparison time: Unlike the UAE, where free zones dominate, Bahrain allows foreign investors to set up on the mainland (including in Bahrain Bay and Seef) with near-full control and less bureaucratic friction. I’ve seen firsthand how this flexibility speeds up market entry and reduces ongoing compliance headaches.\
\
Bahrain Company Formation: Regulatory Backbone\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.). The most popular options for international entrepreneurs are:\
* With Limited Liability Company (WLL)\
* Closed Joint Stock Company (BSC Closed)\
* Branch of a Foreign Company\
* Single Person Company (SPC)\
* Representative Office\
I always recommend starting with a WLL for most cross-border ventures—especially if you plan to trade or export beyond Bahrain’s borders. The MOICT (Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism) portal (Sijilat) is your main gateway, but don’t underestimate the value of meeting government officials in person at the Diplomatic Area service center. (On my second company, a single face-to-face at MOICT cut two weeks off my CR approval time.)\
Ownership Regulations:\
- Since June 2025, the threshold for foreign ownership in “activities open to international business” has been raised to 100% (specifics), with a short list of exceptions (e.g., some local retail).\
- Certain activities still require a Bahraini sponsor or agent (sponsorship details), but workarounds often exist with free zone registration (free zone guide).\
Key Regulatory Bodies:\
* MOICT: Company registration, licensing\
* LMRA: Work visas and employment approvals\
* EDB: Investment support, incentives\
* Tamkeen: Funding and training support\
Bahrain’s “one-stop shop” portals (like Sijilat and LMRA) genuinely work better than the legacy systems in much of the GCC. But technical glitches do surface—the classic trick is to apply for your Commercial Registration (CR) right at 8:05 am on Mondays, before the online queues spike.\
\
Step-by-Step Guide: Cross-Border Company Formation in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation. to confirm cross-border eligibility. The MOICT Sijilat portal lists accepted activities for 100% foreign ownership, export permissions, and regulated sectors.\
2. Reserve Your Company Name\
This is surprisingly competitive; use Sijilat’s online tool, but follow up with a call to lock it in (names are released if not confirmed quickly).\
3. Prepare Constitutive Documents\
\
Memorandum and Articles of Association (template available from EDB)\
Proof of address (office lease agreement from a recognized commercial address in Seef or Diplomatic Area—avoid older buildings to speed up municipality checks)\
Valid passport copies of owners/directors\
Proof of initial bank deposit (for some activities)\
\
Shortcut: Rent a virtual office in Bahrain Bay for CR purposes—Keylink provides these, and their staff understand what the inspectors actually want to see.\
4. Apply for Commercial Registration (CR)\
Process everything online through Sijilat. Schedule a physical office inspection for later in the week to avoid end-of-week crunches.\
5. Obtain Additional Regulatory Approvals\
Certain activities need sectoral approvals (insurance, banking, medical). Start this in parallel with your CR application; don’t wait until after (my biggest mistake was handling these sequentially, which delayed our launch by three weeks).\
6. Register with LMRA for Work Visas\
Submit employee details and apply for investor/employee visas. Tip: Filing right after the new immigration shift at 9:00 am saves you from digital “queue hell.”\
7. Open a Corporate Bank Account\
Major banks like Bank ABC, National Bank of Bahrain, and Al Baraka are the easiest for foreign shareholders. Avoid month-ends—relationship managers are swamped then, and approvals stall.\
8. Finalize Municipality and Tax Authority Registration\
VAT registration is required for annual turnover above BHD 37,500. Prepare for compliance requirements—see accounting & bookkeeping tips for automated solutions.\
\
Cost Considerations: Bahrain Company Formation and Cross-Border Activities\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.:\
- MOICT registration fee: BHD 30–50 (one-time)\
- CR issuance: BHD 50–300 (depends on activity)\
- Virtual office rental: BHD 350–700/year (Seef, Diplomatic Area)\
- Legal/attestation fees: BHD 150–500\
- Other administrative costs: BHD 200–400\
Annual Operating Costs:\
- Accounting/bookkeeping: BHD 400–800/year (service options)\
- LMRA work permits for expats: BHD 72 per permit + monthly BD 5–10 per employee\
- Municipal fees: 10% of annual rent (applicable only if you lease physical premises)\
Compare detailed breakdowns at Keylink’s cost guide.\
A word of caution—many entrepreneurs skip the virtual office or use a residential address. This almost always triggers additional inspections and delays. My advice: Spend the extra BHD 100–200 for a recognized commercial address in a business district.\
\
Regulatory Compliance: Ongoing Requirements for Cross-Border Operators\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.\
- Submit annual VAT returns (if applicable)\
- Maintain up-to-date records for all shareholders and directors\
A common mistake—forgetting to update your board resolution documents or failing to report minor shareholder changes. This can freeze your CR renewal. (I had to scramble for last-minute notary appointments at Al Salam Tower because I ignored a minor statutory form!)\
Insider tip: Hire a local accountant or corporate secretary with Sijilat experience (recommended partners). They know which “unofficial” paperwork the authorities expect, which saves both time and face.\
Recent Policy Change: Starting March 2025, Bahrain’s MOICT now requires all cross-border entities to maintain a digital shareholder registry, accessible to both regulatory and compliance officers. Implementation has been smooth for those using cloud-based accounting (details), but paper-based businesses have faced delays.\
\
Cultural and Practical Tips for Business Success\
\
Alt text: Professional business support..\
- Ramadan hours mean everything opens late and closes early; adjust your timelines accordingly.\
- Government buildings in Seef District are busiest midweek—plan your license pickups for Saturdays, and avoid last-minute runs before major holidays.\
Slight tangent: I once attended a business breakfast at Al Fateh Grand Mosque’s conference center. At first, it felt unrelated to my IT consultancy. But a single networking chat there landed a logistics contract in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, all because I understood Bahrain’s unique approach to business hospitality.\
Bahrain’s regulatory authorities respond better to proactive, respectful follow-ups—face-to-face meetings and WhatsApp chats with government contacts can resolve issues faster than emails or support tickets (especially in the Diplomatic Area MOICT building).\
\
FAQ: Bahrain Cross-Border Business Regulations & Insights\
Q1: Can foreigners really own 100% of their businesses in Bahrain, and in which sectors?\
Yes, since the 2025 amendments, most sectors—including trading, consultancy, and digital services—allow full foreign ownership. Certain strategic or retail sectors may still require local participation. Full sector list here.\
Q2: What are the main post-setup compliance headaches I should anticipate?\
Annual CR renewals, up-to-date shareholder documents, annual audits, and VAT reporting (if turnover exceeds BHD 37,500). Using an efficient accounting service can eliminate most hassles.\
Q3: Is there a significant cost difference between mainland and free zone company setups in Bahrain?\
Free zones can offer lower operational costs and faster setup for certain activities (see guide), but mainland setups grant greater business and hiring flexibility. For most cross-border traders and service firms, the cost difference is minimal—budget BHD 1,200–2,600 for full initial setup.\
Q4: What are the most common mistakes entrepreneurs make when setting up cross-border companies in Bahrain?\
\
Using unrecognized addresses for CR registration\
Failing to align business activity codes with export goals\
Delaying regulatory approvals (banking, sectoral) until after CR is issued\
\
Prevent these by pre-booking your office lease in a business district, confirming all activity codes with an expert, and running approvals in parallel. More prevention strategies here.\
Q5: Are there recommended professional services to help with company formation and ongoing compliance?\
Absolutely—firms like Keylink are well-established, speak fluent English and Arabic, and know the “unwritten” insider tips. They can also expedite document clearances and bank introductions (I used them for my third business and cut the setup time by 30%).\
\
Final Thoughts\
Bahrain’s pro-business environment, digital-first public services, and welcoming culture make it one of the GCC’s top destinations for cross-border business. But success isn’t just about ticking regulatory boxes: it’s about timing, relationships, and local savvy. Start with the right structure, invest in personal connections, and use proven local partners for setup and compliance. And never underestimate the power of a well-timed cup of coffee in the Diplomatic Area.\

**What I had:**  
\#02-05 Uncle Louis Famous Chicken Rice  
Steamed Chicken Rice + Char Siew + Roast pork $8.00 ($4 base + $2 per meat)  
  
Did I order too much? Yea. But gotta go for the review.   
It was a friday so there wasn't a queue at all, usually, I see the queue snaking until the escalator there. 

**What I liked:**  
White chicken was extremely tender; I ordered chicken breast to see if it was dry or tough, and I'm happy to announce that it's neither. 

Roast pork was extremely crispy and juicy, the skin was crisp like Filipino chicharon; you bite into it, and the whole pantry can hear. The fat-to-meat ratio was also perfect, giving you an oil-filled enough bite that still pack the flavors of the meat. 

Chilli packed a good punch. 

  
**What I didn't like:**   
Char Siew was a little dry, which is unfortunate because the sweet sauce caramelization was actually quite decent. The fatty bits were nice too but the juxaposition between soft fats and dry meat created a very confusing texture while biting. 

Dabao and order-issue but the sauce drizzled on the  rice was a bit too much and overwhelming. You have the chicken rice sauce and the char siew sauce sprinkled on the rice and the rice soaking up all the sauces and juices for 7 mins while i walk back to my office - creates a very mushy texture on some parts of the rice by the time I dig into it. 

**Final Rating:**  
3 plates - can skip the char siew but everything else was very good 



  
**What I had:**

Brief Health background: I'm 27, I'm overweight, I smoked vape and weed before pregnancy. I stopped vaping the moment i found out i was pregnant. This is my first pregnancy

We had just recently moved out of our apartment and had zero furniture at home. We had an unexpected pregnancy, and I was told I had an ectopic pregnancy in January (Week 8), but that was malpractice by the doctor; turns out I just had an anterior placenta.  
I smoked weed to eat as i was losing a lot of weight due to nausea and vomiting, and coping with the grief of a possible miscarriage, but I ended up using it once a month when I was stressed out. In February, I was terminated by my workplace, and so I sued them without a lawyer, so I had to go through all the hearings by myself (stressed and angry). When we had enough financial stability, we continued our check-ups at a renowned hospital, and the baby kept growing normally.  
  
I found a job that same month (February) and had to prove myself worthy, and so I overworked myself. My husband and I got into fights weekly, and I kept saying things I didn't mean about me and the baby's health. (It's like I was claiming it). I stopped smoking weed in July, and I think the drastic shift stressed me out, and then the problems started to happen in August.

At 35 weeks, I self-diagnosed myself to have possible pre-eclampsia, this was due to my severe swelling, so i started to monitor my BP and then got myself tested at the laboratory and got traces of protein in my urine + i had IUGR and low amniotic fluid, i immedietly went to my OBGYN and she recommended i undergo immediate C-section but i didn't trust her anymore, she was very passive during our previous appointments and missed an important detail and i couldn't afford to pay for NICU so we went to a public hospital and i got confined until i could safely deliver through an induction at week 37 and they gave me medication to control my blood pressure + they gave me folic acid but still told me to continue on my prenatals (I used Pregnacare Max) and asked me to return on the 21st of August.  
  
At 37 weeks (August 21), the attending doctors said I should get induced immediately, and due to previous malpractices I faced, I refused, rescheduled for August 30 (just so my baby could complete 38 weeks). I have been checking my blood pressure, my oxygen levels, and bought a Doppler to monitor them at any time. I also relied heavily on ChatGPT to tell me if my stats were normal. So I thought I got it under control, everything seemed fine.

On the night of *28th*, I missed my (Hypertension) dose due to sleep, and when I woke up, my blood pressure reading was lower than normal, but the doppler showed the baby still had a heartbeat. I went to the hospital on the 29th to get a refill on my medications, and the doctor asked for a CTG, They found no heartbeat and confirmed it through an ultrasound. I underwent induction and had to give birth to my stillborn child.  
  
Ironically, my baby was born and rested on August 30.  
  
Below are the specific things I did during my pregnancy that others have warned me about. Whether it's superstition or medically related.

**Do NOT do what I did — a checklist to avoid:**

1. **Ignore medical advice for serious conditions.** If your doctor warns about IUGR, oligohydramnios (low fluid), or preeclampsia, take it seriously. These aren’t minor issues you can “wait out.”
2. **Refuse induction or recommended delivery without understanding the real risk.** If induction or C-section is recommended for medical reasons, don’t decline because you “don’t feel ready.” Waiting can be deadly.
3. **Use substances during pregnancy — even “small” amounts of weed or vaping.** I used tiny amounts of weed (0.1 gram) once a week, thinking it was harmless. I kept justifying it because others seemed fine. It’s a risk you don’t need to take. 
4. **Trust anonymous internet stories as proof that risky behavior is “safe.”** “I knew someone who smoked and was fine” isn’t medical evidence. Don’t gamble on anecdote over advice. I was following bluntblowinmama and their stories.
5. **Stop or miss prescribed medications because of convenience or money.** I missed doses and delayed refills. If you’re prescribed blood-pressure meds or other treatments, keep taking them and refill on time.
6. **Skip prenatal appointments or delay tests because life is hectic.** Work, money, or shame are not good reasons to miss monitoring that could save your baby. 
7. **Prioritize other people’s opinions (or “saving money”) over recommended care.** I listened to family who said private clinics just make you do things for money. Don’t let that stop you from following medical recommendations. Trust your gut always; no one else matters.
8. **Let stress, court cases, or job anxiety swallow your pregnancy care.** Legal fights, work, and money are stressful — but don’t let them push prenatal care and your health to the back burner. Don't stress yourself out, try and find ways to cope.
9. **Starve yourself or neglect nutrition and supplements.** Skipping meals and stopping prenatals when you can’t afford them is dangerous. Talk to your provider or social services if you need help getting supplements.
10. **Delay going to the hospital for monitoring when you notice problems.** If you have decreased movements, high/low BP readings, or your doctor tells you to be monitored — go immediately. Don’t wait until tomorrow.
11. **Assume home monitoring (Doppler, BP checks alone) replaces professional assessment.** Home devices are helpful for reassurance but not a substitute for clinical evaluation when risks are present.
12. **Refuse help and isolate when you’re scared or ashamed.** Shame kept me from fully engaging with care. Ask for help — from doctors, social workers, or friends — even if it’s difficult.
13. **Use relationship conflict as an excuse to avoid care or make impulsive choices.** I let anger, fights, and family stress cloud judgment about medical decisions. Don’t let emotional turmoil lead to life-threatening delays.
14. **Think “it won’t happen to me.”** Pregnancy outcomes can change fast. When professionals say there’s a risk, act as if the warning is urgent — because often it is.
15. **Your birth plan does not matter, just because you have it written in bold "" trust your body"" doesn't mean you forget about your instincts and your logical thinking** 
16. **If you're not feeling the doctor**'**s diagnosis, get a second or third opinion.**
17. **It doesn't matter if you're not ready, whether you haven't done the photoshoot, the baby shower the gender reveal**

  
Superstitions/things they've told me or warned me about during my pregnancy that replays constantly in my head. (I come from an east asian household)

The cause of stillbirth is still unknown in some cases. If even the slightest thing can make a difference, I hope you take into consideration that I could be a hysterical grieving mother, and I really do not wish this type of loss on anyone.

1. Don't oil your belly your amniotic fluid can dry up (Superstitions)
2. Don't step over cords 
3. Don't wear necklaces (older people said this caused the cord to wrap around their necks)
4. If your pet get's jealous of your unborn child, they will take it away (Superstitions)
5. Don't watch things that make you scared or sad 
6. Don't risk drinking caffeine as it could dehydrate you (I drank coffee and Diet Pepsi a lot)
7. Don't wish ill things on you or your baby, cause they hear you  (Superstitions)
8. Anterior Placenta is a bad omen (Superstitions). Ask them to monitor your placenta and monitor blood flow
9. Don't sleep with open windows or exposed windows (Superstitions), spirits come and take your baby away
10. Speak to your baby frequently and tell them to be healthy and come out safely 
11. Count the kicks even if your placenta is Anterior (any change in movement needs to be recorded and a doctor needs to be informed)
12. Not knowing the gender earlier on (I found out on the 25th and started to bond with the baby more than the idea of it )
13. **It won’t happen to me.** was something I said the whole pregnancy too
14. Be there in the moment, no matter how hectic life gets, you never know when's the last time their heart beats.

1nlm9jk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nlm9jk/how_to_clean_an_electric_kettle_without_hassle/,How to clean an electric kettle without hassle?,"Hey everyone! I've been using electric kettles for years, and I recently discovered some game-changing cleaning methods I just had to share. If you're like me, you've probably noticed that nasty limescale buildup that makes your morning tea or coffee taste a bit off.

I remember when I first got my electric kettle from https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle - it was all shiny and perfect. But after a few months, I started noticing white crusty deposits inside. That's when I knew I needed to step up my cleaning game.

Here's what I've learned works best:

The Vinegar Method (My Go-To):
- Mix equal parts white vinegar and water
- Fill the kettle halfway
- Boil the mixture
- Let it sit for 20 minutes
- Rinse thoroughly
- Boil fresh water twice to remove any vinegar smell

The Citric Acid Solution:
- Add 1-2 tablespoons of citric acid to a full kettle
- Boil water
- Let it sit for 15 minutes
- Rinse well

The Lemon Method:
- Cut a lemon into quarters
- Add to kettle with water
- Boil and let sit for an hour
- Rinse thoroughly

Pro Tips I've Learned:
1. Clean your kettle monthly to prevent heavy buildup
2. Never use harsh chemicals - they can damage the heating element
3. Don't scrub the inside with abrasive materials
4. Always rinse multiple times after cleaning

If you're in the market for a new electric kettle that's easier to clean, I recently found some great options at https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle. The ones with wider openings are much easier to clean and maintain.

One thing I've noticed is that filtered water helps reduce limescale buildup significantly. I switched to filtered water about six months ago, and it's made a huge difference in how often I need to clean my kettle.

Also, don't forget to wipe down the exterior and base regularly with a damp cloth. It's amazing how much dust can accumulate around the heating element.

I hope these tips help keep your electric kettle clean and your beverages tasting great! Let me know if you have any questions or other cleaning methods that work well for you.",1,1758334530.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

Even though he knew that I was not that and showed zero interest in that. 

But I was skinny fat (51kg) when I met him because I just didn’t eat much. I would usually eat like one real meal a day and that was take out cos I’m lazy and hate spending time cooking. Then a couple of snacks and coffee. 

After I married him, I gained 15kg (35 lbs?) in like 6 months just because he encouraged me to eat and a lot of high calorie food. 

He is athletic and stays fit just from exercising a lot and fasting when he cuts but his diet is ridiculously bad. He basically lives off chocolate, eggs, pastries, and pizza, and pasta. 

I gained 20 more kg after our first baby. I had ridiculous appetite during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

Surprisingly, he is very respectful about my weight but I could tell he wasn’t attracted. 

I lost 10kg just by my appetite regulating again. But I knew I had to make more effort to go back to how I was before. My appetite is still much higher than when I was skinny fat. 

I got really into fitness and health. I liked how it makes me feel, and it was a good distraction from what’s lacking in my marriage. I am now 60kg. My husband was giving me compliments and commenting a lot when I got to around 65kg. He has been away recently so he hasn’t seen me since then. Weight changes show up a lot on me because I’m short. 

He recently has been saying I am losing too much weight and he thinks I’m obsessed. I find this weird cos I’m not that thin. He’s from France so beauty standard there is way thinner than I am now and over there I’d be considered average or a bit heavier than average. It’s also weird considering what he told me is his preference. Like do you not realise what it actually takes to be athletic? Normally that comes with a lot of effort, especially at my age. And you normally will have a lower body weight naturally

I am just wondering if this is because he is scared I am getting “too good” for him. Or if he genuinely believes that? What has other people’s experiences been?",1,1758334444.0,NarcissisticSpouses,3,0.67,False

But then, after getting betrayed many times, tricked, and the encounter with many adversaries and Smasher, V got PTSD and now wreaks havoc as a vigilante who just destroys every criminal she encounters. I left off all NCPD scans, a lot of the sides that involves slipping into enemy territories (so I can start completing them all as The Dark Hood), and from sporting brightly colored clothes (Yellow, Red, Blue - depending on the gig/event), V now wears different variations of black ""military gear"" during ops. This version of V focuses on stealth, and deception, using objects around her as bait and traps (Int 20 Body 15 Tech 20 Ref 20). She only operates at night and drinks exactly 3 cups of coffee after waking up at 9PM.

For those who want to read more, we will provide access to the upcoming chapter shortly. Keep engaging, and the next chapter will be unlocked for you)

Chapter 1

I stared at the coffee spreading across my sketches, watching months of work dissolve into a brown puddle. The barista rushed over with napkins, but it was too late. My presentation for tomorrow's client meeting was ruined.

""Allow me,"" a deep voice said from behind me.

I turned to find a tall man in an impeccably tailored suit extending a handkerchief. His eyes—a striking steel blue—held mine with unexpected intensity.

""Thank you, but I don't think a handkerchief will save these,"" I said, gesturing at the soaked papers.

""Perhaps not, but I might have a better solution."" He slid into the chair opposite mine with casual confidence. ""Xavier Marshall.""

The name registered immediately. Xavier Marshall—CEO of Marshall Industries, one of the largest design and manufacturing conglomerates in the country. I'd seen his face in business magazines.

""Elyse Gray,"" I replied, instinctively reaching for my sketchbook to shield it from view. After what happened with James and Sophia, I'd become protective of my work.

""I recognize that technique,"" he said, nodding toward a corner of my sketch that had escaped the coffee. ""Your jewelry line from last season had similar elements. Brilliant work.""

I blinked in surprise. ""You follow fashion design?""

""I make it my business to know talent when I see it."" His smile seemed genuine, reaching his eyes. ""Now, about your sketches—I have an art supply store in my building two blocks from here. Let me replace your materials.""

""That's very kind, but—""

""And perhaps dinner afterward? I know a place that serves excellent inspiration alongside their entrées.""

I should have said no. Seven years with James had ended just three months ago with him announcing his engagement to Sophia—my best friend—at what I'd thought was our engagement party. The betrayal was still raw, the wound still bleeding.

But something in Xavier's eyes—interest, respect, perhaps?—made me hesitate. My fingers unconsciously traced geometric patterns on the napkin, a nervous habit when I was thinking.

""Just dinner,"" I said finally. ""And I'll pay for my own art supplies.""

He smiled. ""Of course.""

\* \* \*

One dinner turned into weekly meetings. Weekly meetings evolved into daily texts. Xavier pursued me with an intensity that should have frightened me but instead felt like healing balm on my wounded heart.

On our third date, he flew me to a private gallery opening in Chicago, where the artist's work eerily mirrored themes from my own design portfolio—something I mentioned offhandedly.

""That's why I brought you here,"" Xavier said, his hand warm against my lower back. ""I saw the connection immediately.""

I looked up at him, surprised. ""You studied my portfolio?""

""Thoroughly."" His eyes never left mine. ""You have a unique perspective, Elyse. The way you balance structure with unexpected emotional elements—it's rare.""

That night, flying back in his private helicopter, I sketched as the city lights glowed beneath us. Xavier watched me draw, asking thoughtful questions about my process, my inspiration.

""Do you ever incorporate natural elements in your jewelry designs?"" he asked.

""Sometimes. I did a collection inspired by sea glass last year.""

""And your birthstone?""

I laughed. ""Amethyst? No, I've always found it too...expected.""

He nodded, seeming to file this information away.

Over the following weeks, Xavier's gifts became increasingly personal. Books by obscure design theorists I'd mentioned once. A vintage fashion plate I'd admired in passing. A custom sketchbook with paper specifically selected for my preferred medium.

My design work began to take a backseat to our relationship. When an important client meeting coincided with Xavier's invitation to attend a private showing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, I rescheduled the meeting without hesitation.

""You're different lately,"" my mother observed during our weekly call. ""Happier.""

""I am,"" I admitted, surprised to realize it was true. The pain of James and Sophia's betrayal had faded to a dull ache, overshadowed by Xavier's attentions.

Three months after our coffee shop meeting, Xavier invited me to dinner at his corporate headquarters. The elevator took us to the rooftop, where a single table waited, surrounded by candles.

""What's the occasion?"" I asked as he pulled out my chair.

""You'll see,"" he promised.

After dessert, he led me to the edge of the rooftop. Below us, city lights began to shift and change, buildings illuminating in a pattern. I gasped as I realized they spelled out: MARRY ME.

Xavier knelt before me, opening a velvet box. Inside was a ring unlike any I'd seen—an amethyst set in a design that mirrored one of my own jewelry sketches.

""Elyse Gray,"" he said, his voice steady, ""will you marry me?""

I said yes through tears, never noticing the calculated satisfaction that briefly flickered across his face as he slid the ring onto my finger.

Chapter 2

The Marshall wedding was everything a fairy tale should be—if fairy tales were measured in carats and social standing.

I stood before the ornate mirror in the bridal suite, barely recognizing the woman staring back at me. My dress was a masterpiece of ivory silk and delicate lace, designed specifically for me by Xavier's personal stylist. It hugged my curves in all the right places before cascading to the floor in a waterfall of fabric that probably cost more than most people's annual salary.

""You look stunning,"" my mother said, adjusting my veil with trembling hands. ""I always knew you'd make a beautiful bride, Elyse.""

The ceremony was held in the Marshall family's private chapel, a Gothic masterpiece that had hosted generations of Marshall weddings. As I walked down the aisle, I caught glimpses of familiar faces—not just friends and family, but business titans, celebrities, and even a few politicians.

""Who's that in the third row?"" I whispered to my father as we processed.

""The governor,"" he murmured back, his grip tightening on my arm. ""And behind him is the CEO of Meridian Industries.""

Xavier waited for me at the altar, his blue eyes never leaving mine as I approached. The look on his face—a mixture of pride and possession—made my heart flutter.

""Who would have thought,"" he whispered as I reached him, ""that spilled coffee would lead to this?""

The reception was a blur of champagne toasts and congratulations. What I didn't notice then were the subtle glances, the whispers behind manicured hands.

It wasn't until the next morning that I saw the first headline: ""From Designer to Trophy Wife: Elyse Gray Trades Career for Marshall Fortune.""

I set down my coffee cup, the ceramic making a sharp sound against the marble countertop. ""They're calling me a gold-digger.""

Xavier glanced up from his newspaper, his expression unreadable. ""Don't pay attention to that nonsense. They're just jealous.""

""But I'm not giving up my career,"" I protested, though even as I said it, I realized I hadn't touched my sketchbook since our engagement.

""Of course not,"" Xavier said smoothly, reaching across the table to take my hand. ""But you deserve a break after everything you've been through. The design world can wait.""

\* \* \*

The Maldives honeymoon was paradise on earth—a private villa perched over crystal waters, where the ocean changed colors like a kaleidoscope throughout the day.

""Isn't this better than staring at fabric swatches?"" Xavier asked, joining me on our private deck where I'd been sketching the sunset.

I smiled, closing my notebook. ""I can't deny it's inspiring.""

He kissed me then, his hands sliding possessively around my waist. ""I've arranged for us to have dinner on the beach tonight. Just the two of us.""

That evening, as we dined under strings of twinkling lights with the waves providing a rhythmic soundtrack, Xavier casually mentioned, ""I've had your phone upgraded to the latest secure model. The old one had some... vulnerabilities.""

I accepted the sleek new device without question. ""Thank you.""

""And I've taken the liberty of having your emails forwarded to my assistant for the time being,"" he continued. ""Just until we return. That way you can truly relax without worrying about work.""

It seemed thoughtful at the time—another way Xavier was protecting me, caring for me. I didn't notice how his eyes lingered on my new phone, or how he casually asked about my latest design ideas while pouring more wine.

\* \* \*

Six months into our marriage, I sat on our bathroom floor, staring at the two pink lines on the pregnancy test with trembling hands.

Pregnant.

A wave of emotions crashed over me—joy, fear, wonder. Xavier would be so pleased. We'd talked about children, though we'd agreed to wait a year or two.

I decided to surprise him with the news. I spent the afternoon preparing his favorite meal—herb-crusted lamb with roasted vegetables and a chocolate soufflé for dessert. As the kitchen filled with delicious aromas, I worked on a special sketch—a baby cradle with our initials carved into it.

""This calls for something special,"" I murmured, selecting a bottle of sparkling cider from the wine rack. Xavier had stocked it for my ""special occasions,"" though I rarely drank.

I was arranging flowers on our dining table when I heard his voice from his home office down the hall.

""Everything's proceeding as planned,"" Xavier was saying, his tone clipped and businesslike—so different from the warm voice he used with me.

I froze, candle in hand.

""The designs are ready for implementation,"" he continued. ""Sophia's team has been working on them for months.""

My heart stuttered. Sophia? My former best friend?

""And Elyse suspects nothing,"" Xavier said, a note of satisfaction in his voice. ""She's exactly where we need her to be—out of the game completely.""

The candle slipped from my fingers, narrowly missing the tablecloth.

""Father,"" Xavier said, his voice dropping lower, ""I think you'll be pleased with how thoroughly she's been... neutralized.""

Chapter 3

I pressed myself against the wall outside Xavier's office, my heart hammering so violently I was certain he could hear it through the door. The pregnancy test was still clutched in my trembling hand, two pink lines that had filled me with such joy just moments ago.

""—exactly as planned, Dad. She's completely isolated from her professional contacts now.""

Xavier's voice drifted through the crack in the door, cold and calculating in a way I'd never heard before. This wasn't the warm, loving tone he used when he whispered sweet words against my ear at night.

""Sophia's collection launches next month with the designs, and no one will question where they came from.""

My designs. My stolen work. The sketches I'd poured my heart into, now credited to the woman who had already taken my fiancé. My free hand flew to my mouth, stifling the gasp that threatened to escape.

""The pregnancy wasn't part of the original plan,"" Xavier continued, and I could hear papers rustling. ""But it might actually work in our favor. More reason for her to stay out of the industry permanently.""

The pregnancy test slipped from my fingers, clattering softly to the marble floor. I stared down at it in horror, those two pink lines now looking like a death sentence rather than a blessing.

""Don't worry,"" Xavier said, and I could hear the smile in his voice—the same smile he'd given me when he proposed, when he'd said he loved me. ""I'll handle it. The medication should take care of the problem within a few weeks. She'll never know what hit her.""

The world tilted sideways. My hand instinctively moved to my stomach, protective and desperate. Handle it. Take care of the problem. My baby—our baby—was nothing more than an inconvenience to be eliminated.

I backed away from the door on unsteady legs, my mind reeling. Every moment of our relationship flashed before me in a new, horrifying light. The coffee shop meeting—had that been orchestrated? His knowledge of my work, his gifts, his proposal—all of it calculated to manipulate me into this trap.

Somehow I made it to our bedroom, closing the door with shaking hands. I sank onto the edge of our king-sized bed, the same bed where he'd held me and whispered promises about our future together. Lies. All of it had been lies.

But I couldn't fall apart. Not yet. Not when my child's life depended on my next moves.

I forced myself to breathe, to think. Xavier would expect me to tell him about the pregnancy tonight—I'd already set the romantic dinner, lit the candles. If I didn't go through with it, he'd become suspicious.

Twenty minutes later, I walked into the dining room with my custom sketch in hand, the one showing our little family. My hands were steady now, my expression carefully composed. I'd learned to hide my emotions during those awful months after James and Sophia's betrayal. I could do it again.

""Elyse,"" Xavier said, rising from his chair with that charming smile. ""This looks incredible. What's the occasion?""

""I have something to tell you,"" I said, placing the sketch on the table between us. ""Something wonderful.""

He looked down at the drawing, and for a split second, I saw something flicker across his face—calculation, perhaps annoyance. But it was gone so quickly I might have imagined it.

""Are you...?"" He let the question hang in the air.

""Pregnant,"" I finished, watching his reaction carefully. ""We're going to have a baby, Xavier.""

The joy that spread across his features was masterful in its deception. He swept me into his arms, spinning me around the dining room as if he were the happiest man alive.

""This is incredible,"" he said, setting me down gently. ""Perfect timing, actually. You can focus completely on being a mother now. No more stress about work or clients.""

Even now, even knowing the truth, he was still maneuvering me exactly where he wanted me.

""I should call my mother,"" I said. ""She'll be so excited.""

""Of course,"" Xavier said, but I caught him glancing at his phone. ""Actually, let me just send a quick message to reschedule tomorrow's board meeting. This news changes everything.""

I watched as his fingers flew across the screen, typing rapidly. The message was brief, but I caught a glimpse of the recipient before he closed the phone: ""Dad.""

Accelerating the timeline, no doubt.

That night, as Xavier slept peacefully beside me, I stared at the ceiling and planned. I thought about the medication he'd mentioned, about how he planned to make me lose this baby without me ever knowing. I thought about my stolen designs, about Sophia building her career on my work while I played the perfect, oblivious wife.

But most of all, I thought about survival—mine and my child's.

***Why didn't you ever tell me you loved me?***

I swear, I tried so many times to tell you. But every time, fear held me back. I couldn’t bring myself to hurt our families like that. They would’ve been devastated if we left them. It felt so unfair to even think about it. The consequences were too much to bear.

And then there’s the weight of our differences, the spiritual divide between us.

My parents, they would’ve disowned me for sure this time. I'm already the black sheep, despised for things I can’t undo. It's a burden I’ll carry with me, haunting me for the rest of my life.

***Why did you leave the city?***

There are several reasons and none of them were easy for me to cope.

Once I gathered the courage to ask you out for coffee hoping, just hoping that I could tell you that I had feelings for you. You nonchalantly refused within a second. This broke something in me, I was never refused before by any one. This really crushed me. And I walked away from that hurt, thinking it was the only way to protect myself.

Then, there was the way I had to watch your spouse verbally tear you apart. I wish they knew and appreciated what they have.

But the worst part, the part that made everything so unbearable, was the tension between us. Everyone could feel the tension between us but you and I never acknowledged and spoke about it. This went on for years and it was getting awkward for me to be in the same room with you.

I admit, I was a coward and ran away.

I hope you understand and forgive me for leaving so suddenly. It's been several years since I left but not a single day goes by without thinking about you. You are my secret love that I will cherish in my heart till my last breath. You will always remain a dear friend!",4,1758333595.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

Beeping. Steady, rhythmic beeping. That was the first thing that registered in my consciousness. The second was pain—a dull, throbbing ache that seemed to radiate from everywhere at once.

I tried to open my eyes, but they felt impossibly heavy. When I finally managed to pry them open, harsh fluorescent light stabbed into my retinas, forcing them shut again. I groaned.

""Ava?""

A man's voice. Warm, concerned. Familiar? I couldn't tell.

""Ava, can you hear me?""

I made another attempt to open my eyes, this time more slowly, letting them adjust to the brightness. A blurry figure came into focus beside me—dark hair, worried eyes, stubbled jaw. He was holding my hand, his thumb making gentle circles against my skin.

""Who..."" My voice came out as a rasp, my throat dry and scratchy. ""Where am I?""

\-

The man's face crumpled with a mixture of relief and concern. ""You're in the hospital, sweetheart. You've been in an accident.""

I blinked, trying to process his words. Hospital. Accident. Nothing made sense. I tried to sit up, but pain shot through my body, and his hand gently pressed me back down.

""Easy,"" he said. ""You need to rest.""

I looked around the sterile room—white walls, monitors, the IV in my arm. The realization that I was in a hospital bed was clear enough, but everything else remained a fog. I turned back to the man, studying his face.

""Do I... know you?""

His eyes widened, and something like panic flashed across his features before he composed himself. ""Ava, it's me. Ethan. Your boyfriend.""

I stared at him blankly. Ethan? Boyfriend? I searched my mind for any recognition, any memory of this man or our supposed relationship, but found nothing but emptiness.

""I don't... I can't remember,"" I whispered, fear rising in my chest. ""I can't remember you. I can't remember anything.""

Ethan squeezed my hand tighter. ""The doctor said this might happen. You hit your head pretty hard in the accident. You have what they call retrograde amnesia.""

""Amnesia?"" The word felt strange on my tongue, like something from a soap opera, not real life. Not my life—whatever that was.

""It's okay,"" he said, his voice gentle. ""I'm here. We'll figure this out together.""

A doctor came in then, followed by a nurse. They checked my vitals, asked me questions I couldn't answer, shone lights in my eyes. The doctor—a woman with kind eyes and silver-streaked hair—explained that I'd been hit by a car three days ago. Severe concussion. Broken ribs. Internal bruising. And memory loss.

""How much do you remember, Ava?"" she asked.

I shook my head slowly. ""Nothing. Not even my last name.""

""Miller,"" Ethan supplied. ""Your name is Ava Miller.""

Ava Miller. I repeated it silently to myself. It felt right, at least. That was something.

After the doctor left, Ethan pulled his chair closer to my bed. ""I know this must be terrifying,"" he said. ""But I'm going to help you through it.""

""How long have we..."" I gestured weakly between us.

""Three years,"" he said with a small smile. ""Three amazing years.""

He reached for his phone, scrolled through it, then turned the screen toward me. There we were—his arm around my shoulders, both of us smiling against a backdrop of mountains. Another swipe: us dressed up for what looked like a fancy dinner, my head resting on his shoulder. Another: on a beach at sunset, him kissing my cheek.

I studied each photo carefully, searching for any flicker of recognition, any emotional connection to these moments. There was nothing.

""We look... happy,"" I said finally, not knowing what else to say.

""We are,"" he insisted. ""We're very happy together.""

I glanced at the shattered remains of what I assumed was my phone on the side table. ""Is that...""

""Yeah,"" Ethan nodded. ""It was in your pocket during the accident. Completely destroyed. I already ordered you a new one, but...""

""All my contacts. Messages. Everything,"" I murmured, understanding the implications.

""Don't worry about that now,"" he said, squeezing my hand again. ""I've already called your parents and friends. Everyone knows what happened. They're all worried about you.""

I nodded, feeling utterly lost and completely dependent on this man I couldn't remember. As I looked into his earnest eyes, I wondered why, despite his obvious care and concern, something felt off—like a puzzle piece that almost fits but not quite.

""Thank you,"" I said, because it seemed like the right thing to say.

He smiled and brushed a strand of hair from my face, his fingers lingering against my cheek. ""I love you, Ava. We're going to get through this together.""

I tried to smile back, but inside, a small voice whispered: Who am I really? And why can't I shake this feeling that something isn't right?

Chapter 2

The days after my accident blended together in a haze of hospital routines, medication, and the constant presence of Ethan. I was released from the hospital after five days with prescriptions, follow-up appointments, and a head still full of fog where my memories should be.

Ethan brought me to what he said was our shared apartment. It was a modern one-bedroom with large windows and minimalist furniture. Nothing about it triggered any recognition.

""This is... home?"" I asked, running my fingers along the kitchen counter.

""For the last year and a half,"" Ethan confirmed, setting my hospital bag down. ""Before that, we had separate places but practically lived at each other's apartments.""

I nodded, absorbing this information like I was studying for a test about my own life. Everything Ethan told me about us sounded plausible, even sweet—how we met at a coffee shop when I spilled my latte on his laptop, our first date at an outdoor concert, weekend trips to the coast. But it all felt like stories about someone else.

On my third day home, I was sitting on the couch while Ethan made lunch. My new phone had arrived the day before, pristine and empty of contacts or history.

""Ethan?"" I called out. ""Do you have our text conversations backed up somewhere? Maybe reading them would help jog my memory.""

The sound of chopping paused momentarily. ""I don't think so,"" he replied after a beat. ""I'm not really the type to save messages.""

""But wouldn't they still be on your phone?""

He appeared in the doorway, a dish towel in his hands. ""My phone had some issues a few weeks ago. Had to do a factory reset. Lost most of our recent conversations.""

It seemed like a reasonable explanation, but something in his expression—a flicker of tension around his eyes—made me uneasy.

""What about that Italian restaurant you mentioned yesterday? The one where we celebrated our anniversary last month? Could we go there? Maybe being in places we frequented will help.""

Ethan's smile tightened almost imperceptibly. ""They're closed for renovations right now. Bad timing, huh? But we can try that Thai place you love instead.""

Later that evening, I found myself scrolling through the photos Ethan had transferred to my new phone. There were dozens of us together—hiking, at parties, cuddled on the couch—but I noticed something odd. Most were from six months ago or earlier. The most recent one was dated three months ago, at what looked like a friend's birthday party.

""Ethan?"" I called from the bedroom. ""Why don't we have many recent photos together?""

He appeared at the doorway, leaning against the frame. ""We've both been swamped with work lately. You were finishing that big marketing project, remember? And I had the Peterson account.""

""No,"" I said quietly. ""I don't remember.""

His face softened immediately. ""I'm sorry, that was stupid of me."" He sat beside me on the bed. ""We just got busy with life, that's all. Stopped taking so many pictures.""

I nodded, though the explanation felt hollow. Wouldn't a couple in love for three years still snap occasional selfies, even during busy periods?

The next day, I decided to reach out to the friends and family Ethan had mentioned. He'd programmed several numbers into my new phone—my parents, my best friend Megan, his brother Kyle.

I called my parents first. Straight to voicemail.

""They're on that Mediterranean cruise, remember?"" Ethan said when I mentioned it. ""Poor reception at sea. They'll call when they can.""

Megan didn't answer either. Nor did the three other friends I tried.

""Megan's at that work conference in Seattle,"" Ethan explained. ""And Jamie and David just had their baby, so they're probably swamped. As for Liz, she's always terrible about answering her phone.""

Each explanation was reasonable, yet collectively they formed a pattern that made my skin prickle with unease. How convenient that everyone in my life was simultaneously unreachable.

That night, as Ethan slept beside me, I stared at the ceiling, listening to his even breathing. Everything he told me made sense on the surface, but underneath, something felt wrong—like reading a novel with pages missing. The timeline gaps, the absent friends, the vanished messages...

Who was I really? And why did I have the growing suspicion that the story Ethan was telling me wasn't the whole truth?

Chapter 3

The physical therapy room smelled like antiseptic and sweat. I gripped the parallel bars, my knuckles turning white as I forced my trembling legs to take another step. Three sessions in, and my body still felt like a stranger's—weak, uncooperative, and constantly reminding me of the accident I couldn't remember.

""You're doing great, Ava,"" my therapist, Miguel, encouraged. ""Just two more steps and we'll take a break.""

I nodded, focusing on the floor tiles as if they held the secret to walking normally again. My ribs ached with each breath, but I pushed forward. One more step. Then another.

""Good job,"" Miguel said, helping me to a nearby chair. ""Rest for five minutes, then we'll try some balance exercises.""

As he stepped away to check his clipboard, I leaned back, closing my eyes. The physical exhaustion was almost a relief compared to the mental strain of trying to piece together my fractured life. Every day with Ethan felt like reading a novel with random chapters missing—the broad story made sense, but crucial details were absent, leaving me constantly disoriented.

The door to the therapy room swung open, and two nurses entered, their conversation drifting over to where I sat.

""—the Miller case, right?"" one was saying, her voice low but still audible in the quiet room. ""The amnesia patient from the car accident last week?""

My eyes remained closed, but my attention sharpened instantly.

""Yes, such a shame,"" the second nurse replied. ""Officer Ramirez mentioned witnesses saw a couple having a pretty violent argument right before it happened. The guy apparently grabbed her arm when she tried to walk away.""

""No way! Do they think he pushed her?""

""Not deliberately, from what I heard. But they were definitely fighting, not out on some romantic evening like the boyfriend claims.""

My heart began pounding so hard I could feel it in my throat. Romantic evening? That's exactly what Ethan had described—a perfect dinner date followed by a freak accident when we were crossing the street.

""Poor thing doesn't remember any of it,"" the first nurse continued. ""Can you imagine? Having to trust the very person you were fighting with?""

Their voices faded as they moved to the other side of the room, but their words remained, echoing in my mind like a siren. Fighting? Ethan and I were fighting before my accident?

The rest of the therapy session passed in a blur. I went through the motions mechanically while my thoughts raced. Had Ethan lied about what happened that night? Why would he create a fictional romantic evening if we'd actually been arguing?

By the time Ethan arrived to pick me up, I'd rehearsed my approach a dozen times. I needed answers, but I also needed to be careful. If he had lied about this, what else might he be hiding?

The drive home was quiet, my fingers nervously twisting in my lap. Once inside our apartment, I took a deep breath.

""Ethan, I overheard something strange at therapy today,"" I began, watching his face carefully. ""Some nurses were talking about my accident. They said witnesses reported seeing a couple arguing violently right before it happened. They thought it was us.""

The change in his expression was subtle but unmistakable—a momentary widening of the eyes, a tightening around the mouth, a quick swallow before he composed himself.

""That's... that's ridiculous,"" he said, but his voice had lost its usual confidence. ""We had a perfect evening. Dinner at that new French place, remember? Well, you don't remember, but that's what happened.""

""The nurses said the police report mentioned witnesses,"" I pressed. ""Why would they say we were fighting if we weren't?""

Ethan ran a hand through his hair, a nervous gesture I'd noticed before. ""They must be confused. Or talking about a different couple. There were probably multiple accidents that day.""

""They specifically mentioned my name, Ethan. And the amnesia.""

He moved to the kitchen, turning his back to me as he filled a glass with water. ""Look, Ava, witness accounts are notoriously unreliable. People see what they expect to see, especially in traumatic situations.""

His explanation sounded rehearsed, hollow. And something else bothered me—he hadn't seemed surprised by the accusation, just defensive.

""Ethan,"" I said quietly, ""what really happened the night of my accident?""

He turned to face me, and for a split second, I saw something in his eyes that sent a chill down my spine—not guilt or anger, but fear. Pure, undiluted fear.

""I told you what happened,"" he insisted, his voice strained. ""Why can't you just trust me?""

That's when I knew with absolute certainty—the man who claimed to love me was hiding something. Something big enough to make him rewrite history. And I was determined to find out what it was.

I knocked twice on Axel Hawthorne's office door before pushing it open, my heels clicking against the polished marble floor. The familiar scent of his expensive cologne mixed with leather and coffee filled the air. But something was off.

The usual chaos of scattered papers and half-empty coffee cups was absent. Strange.

""Mr. Hawthorne,"" I began, consulting my tablet with practiced efficiency, ""the board meeting is scheduled for two o'clock. That gives us exactly two hours to review the quarterly projections and—""

""Forget about those, Lila. Look at this,"" he interrupted, stepping closer. He slid a thick folder across the desk toward me. “Check,”

I lowered my head and took a look. The header made my stomach drop: PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT.

""What?"" My voice came out steadier than I felt.

""Don’t question, just nod,"" Axel said, his tone clipped, businesslike—as if he were discussing a merger instead of… whatever this was. ""We need to sign this and get married. Today.""

\-

The words hit me like a physical blow. I stared at him, unable to speak. My brain short-circuited.

“I—I know, I read English, I know what the file means” I managed, voice trembling, “but… still, what?”

""You heard me."" He stood abruptly, pacing to the floor-to-ceiling windows that overlooked Manhattan. His reflection in the glass looked tense, shoulders rigid beneath his tailored suit jacket. ""We're getting married. This afternoon, if possible.""

I stared at his back, my mind reeling.

This was Axel Hawthorne—the man who'd cycled through more supermodels than I could count, who'd made headlines just last month for his very public breakup with that Brazilian actress.

The man who'd once told me that marriage was ""an outdated institution designed to trap ambitious men.""

""Mr. Hawthorne,"" I said carefully, ""I think you might be having some kind of breakdown. Should I call Dr. Richardson?""

He spun around, his eyes flashing with irritation. ""I'm not having a breakdown, Lila. I'm being practical. And you're going to help me.""

""Help you with what, exactly?"" I kept my voice level, though my hands were trembling slightly.

""Because from where I'm sitting, this looks like you've lost your mind."" A bitter laugh escaped him. ""My father has given me an ultimatum. Marry within twelve months, or watch my inheritance—and control of Hawthorne Industries—pass to my dear sister Isabelle and my charming cousin Julian.""

The pieces began falling into place. Arthur Hawthorne's recent comments about ""settling down"" and ""responsibility."" The increasing pressure from the board about Axel's public image. The way his father had been praising my work ethic and professionalism at every family gathering I'd been forced to attend.

""So you decided to propose to your secretary?"" I couldn't keep the incredulity out of my voice.

""I decided to make a business arrangement with the one person who can tolerate my... temperament."" His jaw tightened. ""You've put up with me for three years, Lila. You know how to handle my moods, my schedule, my requirements. You're efficient, discreet, and my father already approves of you.""

I felt heat rise in my cheeks. ""How flattering. You want to marry me because I'm convenient.""

""I want to marry you because you're controllable,"" he said bluntly, and the words stung more than they should have.

""You won't develop inconvenient emotional attachments. You won't expect romantic gestures or public displays of affection. You'll play the role of dutiful wife until I secure my inheritance, and then we can both move on with our lives.""

I stared at him, this man I'd worked alongside for years, and realized I was seeing him clearly for the first time. Not as my demanding but brilliant boss, but as someone so fundamentally damaged that he viewed marriage as just another business transaction.

""And what makes you think I'd agree to this insane plan?""

He gestured toward the check. ""Turn it over.""

With trembling fingers, I flipped the paper. The amount made my breath catch.

It was more money than I'd see in five years of salary. More than enough to cover Mom's treatments without forcing my sibling Chloe to drain her savings.

More than enough to give my family the security we'd never had.

""How did you—"" I started, then stopped.

Of course he knew about Mom's cancer.

Axel Hawthorne made it his business to know everything about the people in his orbit.

""Your sister's been sending you money,"" he said quietly. ""I've seen the bank transfers when I've reviewed your financial background checks. She's struggling to help with medical bills while you're trying to handle everything alone.""

Shame burned in my throat.

Even my financial privacy had been invaded by this man's need to control everything around him.

""This is enough to handle all of it,"" he continued. ""Your mother's treatments, your sister's debts, your own student loans. All you have to do is wear a ring and attend some social functions.""

I looked down at the prenuptial agreement, my vision blurring slightly.

The terms were clearly outlined in legal jargon, but the essence was simple: a marriage in name only, no physical intimacy required, dissolution after Arthur Hawthorne transferred full control of the company to his son.

""No physical contact?"" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. ""None whatsoever. Separate rooms, separate lives. We'll only need to present a united front in public and at family gatherings.""

I thought of Mom in her hospital bed, of the worry lines that had deepened around Chloe's eyes, of the bills that kept coming no matter how many extra hours I worked.

This money could change everything for my family.

""I need to think about it,"" I said.

""No."" His voice was sharp. ""The wedding is this afternoon. My father is expecting us at the estate at four o'clock.""

""This afternoon?"" I stood up so quickly the chair scraped against the floor. ""Axel, you can't be serious. People don't just decide to get married in a few hours.""

""People with billion-dollar inheritances on the line do."" He moved back to his desk, pulling out a pen. ""My father may be traditional, but he's not stupid. If I wait too long, he'll realize this is a sham. It has to look spontaneous, like we've been hiding our relationship.""

I stared at the contract, at the check, at this man who was offering to solve all my problems with the emotional warmth of a business merger.

Everything in me screamed that this was wrong, that I was about to make a terrible mistake.

But then I thought of Mom's tired smile when she insisted she was feeling better, of Chloe's stubborn pride as she sent money she couldn't afford, of the fear that kept me awake at night wondering what would happen if the treatments stopped working.

My hand was shaking as I picked up the pen.

""Just to be clear,"" I said, my voice steady despite the chaos in my chest, ""this is purely business. No emotions, no expectations beyond what's written in this contract.""

""Purely business,"" he agreed, though something flickered in his eyes that I couldn't read.

I signed my name with careful precision, sealing my fate with black ink on white paper.

Axel signed below me, his signature bold and confident.

As I set down the pen, I realized my life had just changed forever.

In less than four hours, I would be Mrs. Axel Hawthorne. The thought terrified me almost as much as the money relieved me.

Chapter 2

The master bedroom at Hawthorne Estate felt like a gilded prison.

Arthur Hawthorne had insisted on giving us the ""grand tour"" after our hastily arranged ceremony in the garden, his weathered face beaming with satisfaction as he opened the heavy oak doors to reveal our new shared quarters.

The room was enormous—larger than my entire apartment—with soaring ceilings, antique furniture, and a four-poster bed that dominated the space like an accusation.

""I had the staff prepare everything for you both,"" Arthur had said, his voice warm with genuine pleasure. ""Fresh linens, extra pillows. I want you to be comfortable in your new home.""

Axel had stood rigidly beside me, his jaw clenched as his father continued the charade of welcoming his new daughter-in-law. I'd managed weak smiles and appropriate responses, but inside I was screaming. This wasn't supposed to be real. This was supposed to be a business arrangement.

Separate rooms? Separate lives?

Now, two hours later, I stood in the corner near the massive walk-in closet, watching Axel claim the opposite side of the room like we were dividing territory in a war zone.

""I'll take the left side,"" he announced without looking at me, dropping his overnight bag near the antique writing desk. ""You can have everything else.""

""How generous,"" I muttered, setting my single suitcase on the bench at the foot of the bed. Honestly, it took everything I had not to fling an f-word curse straight at his smug face.

He shot me a sharp look. ""Don't start, Lila. We both knew this was part of the arrangement.""

The arrangement. As if sleeping in the same room as my new husband was just another line item in our contract.

I unpacked methodically, hanging my work clothes in the far corner of the closet while Axel established his own space with military precision.

We moved around each other like hostile roommates, careful not to make eye contact or accidentally brush against one another.

The next two weeks fell into a rhythm that was both exhausting and oddly predictable.

At the office, nothing had changed. If anything, our professional dynamic had grown even more frigid. Axel barked orders with his usual imperious tone, and I responded with clipped efficiency. Our colleagues remained oblivious to the fact that we went home to the same address each night.

""The Morrison contracts need revisions,"" he'd snap during morning briefings, not bothering to look up from his computer screen.

""I'll have them on your desk by noon,"" I'd reply, my voice professionally neutral even as I remembered the sound of his breathing in the darkness the night before.

But it was the evenings that tested my sanity.

Back in our shared bedroom, we'd retreat to our respective corners like boxers returning to neutral positions. Axel would sprawl in the leather armchair near his desk, laptop balanced on his knees, scrolling through social media with the volume turned up just enough to be annoying.

""Oh, look at this,"" he'd say with theatrical disgust, his voice dripping with sarcasm. ""Serena's in Milan again. Apparently, she's 'finding herself' through expensive pasta and designer shopping.""

I'd glance over to see him studying his phone screen, where his supermodel ex-girlfriend posed in front of some fountain, all long legs and perfect cheekbones. His commentary was vicious and constant.

""And here she is pretending to read Proust at a café. Because nothing says intellectual depth like holding a book upside down for Instagram.""

Meanwhile, I'd settle into the window seat with my Bluetooth headphones, conducting hushed conversations with Dr. Thorne about Mom's treatment progress. The irony wasn't lost on me—while my husband mocked his ex-lover's shallow pursuits, I was coordinating chemotherapy schedules and discussing insurance coverage.

""The new medication is showing promise,"" Dr. Thorne's voice would filter through my headphones. ""But we'll need to monitor her white blood cell count closely.""

""How closely?"" I'd whisper, turning toward the window so Axel couldn't see my face.

""Twice weekly blood draws for the next month.""

I'd make notes in my phone, calculating travel time to the hospital, rearranging my schedule to accommodate the appointments. Across the room, Axel would snort at another of Serena's posts.

""'Embracing my authentic self,'"" he'd read aloud mockingly. ""Her authentic self has had more work done than a vintage Ferrari.""

We were like two people living in parallel universes, occupying the same space but existing in completely different realities. The only time our worlds collided was when Arthur summoned us for family dinners.

Those performances were torture.

""How are you settling in, my dear?"" Arthur would ask, his keen eyes studying my face as we sat in the formal dining room.

I'd feel Axel tense beside me, and I'd force a smile. ""Wonderfully. Axel has been so... attentive.""

The word tasted like ash in my mouth, but Arthur beamed with approval. Under the table, Axel would shift closer, his thigh brushing against mine in a gesture that looked intimate but felt like a business transaction.

""I'm glad to see my son finally appreciating what's been right in front of him all along,"" Arthur would continue, raising his wine glass in a toast.

Axel would dutifully lean over and press a brief, cold kiss to my temple. His lips would linger just long enough to sell the illusion, and I'd have to resist the urge to flinch away from the contact.

""She keeps me grounded,"" Axel would say, his voice perfectly modulated to suggest affection. ""I don't know what I did without her.""

Lies. All of it, carefully constructed lies that we performed like actors in a play neither of us wanted to be in.

Tonight was no different. We sat through another elaborate dinner, making small talk about the company, the weather, anything except the elephant in the room. Arthur regaled us with stories from his own courtship of Axel's mother, his eyes growing distant with memory.

""She was stubborn, that woman,"" he said with a fond chuckle. ""Took me three proposals before she'd even consider saying yes.""

I felt Axel's hand find mine on the table, his fingers interlacing with mine in a display of marital unity. His palm was warm, slightly rough from his weekend sailing hobby, and the contact sent an unwelcome jolt through my system.

""Some women are worth the wait,"" Axel said smoothly, his thumb stroking across my knuckles.

I was about to respond with something appropriately loving when my phone buzzed against my thigh. The caller ID made my blood freeze: Dr. Thorne.

He never called this late unless something was wrong.

""Excuse me,"" I said, my voice tight with sudden panic. ""I need to take this.""

I stood abruptly, my chair scraping against the hardwood floor, and stepped into the hallway with trembling fingers.

""Dr. Thorne?""

""Lila, I'm sorry to call so late, but your mother's condition has deteriorated rapidly. We're taking her into emergency surgery now.""

The world tilted sideways. ""What happened? She was stable this morning—""

""Sometimes these things happen quickly. The tumor has shifted, and there's internal bleeding. We need to operate immediately.""

My knees nearly buckled. ""I'm coming. I'll be there in—""

""Lila?"" Arthur's voice came from behind me, concern evident in his tone. ""Is everything alright?""

I turned to find both men watching me, Arthur's face creased with worry, Axel's expression unreadable. The weight of my situation crashed down on me—I was supposed to be a happily married woman now, not someone who disappeared alone into the night to handle family crises.

""I... my mother..."" I looked helplessly between them, my carefully constructed new life suddenly feeling like a house of cards in a windstorm.

Chapter 3

My instinct was to run. To grab my purse, rush to the parking garage, and drive to the hospital as fast as my little sedan could carry me. But Arthur's concerned gaze pinned me in place, and the crushing reality of my situation hit me like a physical blow.

I wasn't Lila Monroe anymore, the independent secretary who handled family crises alone. I was Mrs. Axel Hawthorne now, and married women didn't disappear into the night without their husbands.

""I have to go,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. ""My mother is in emergency surgery.""

Arthur's face immediately softened with genuine concern. ""Oh, my dear. Of course you must go to her."" His eyes shifted expectantly to his son. ""Axel will drive you.""

The silence stretched between us like a taut wire. I could feel Axel's reluctance radiating from across the hallway, but Arthur's expectant stare left no room for argument. This was what married couples did—they supported each other through family emergencies.

""Of course,"" Axel said finally, his voice carefully controlled. ""Let me get my keys.""

Within minutes, we were in his sleek black Aston Martin, the leather seats cold against my back as he navigated through the estate's winding driveway. The silence in the car was suffocating, broken only by the soft purr of the engine and my ragged breathing.

I pressed my phone to my ear, trying Dr. Thorne's number again, but it went straight to voicemail. My hands wouldn't stop shaking. Every red light felt like an eternity, every slow-moving car ahead of us a personal affront to my mother's life hanging in the balance.

""She was fine this morning,"" I whispered, more to myself than to Axel. ""The last scan showed the tumor was stable. How does something like this just happen?""

Axel's knuckles were white against the steering wheel, but he said nothing. I caught him glancing at me sideways, his mouth opening as if to speak, then closing again. The awkwardness was almost as unbearable as my fear.

""I should have been there,"" I continued, my voice growing more frantic. ""I should have insisted on staying overnight. What if she was scared? What if she called for me and I wasn't—""

""Lila."" Axel's voice was sharp, cutting through my spiral. ""Stop.""

I turned to stare at him, anger flaring through my panic. ""Stop what? Caring about my mother?""

""Stop torturing yourself with things you can't control."" His jaw was tight, eyes fixed on the road ahead. ""You couldn't have prevented this.""

The words were meant to be comforting, I think, but they came out clipped and clinical. Like he was delivering a business report rather than consoling his wife. I turned back to the window, watching the city lights blur past through my tears.

He tried again a few minutes later. ""The doctors at Presbyterian are excellent. I've made donations to their oncology wing. They have the best equipment, the most experienced surgeons—""

""Please don't,"" I interrupted. ""Don't try to fix this with money or connections. Just... don't.""

Another stretch of silence. I could feel him struggling beside me, this man who could command boardrooms and negotiate million-dollar deals but had no idea how to comfort a frightened woman. My hands trembled in my lap as I tried Dr. Thorne's number again, and this time Axel noticed.

Without warning, his right hand left the steering wheel and covered both of mine. His palm was warm, steady, and surprisingly gentle as his fingers interlaced with mine.

""She's going to be okay,"" he said quietly. Not with his usual arrogant certainty, but with something softer. Something that sounded almost like hope.

I looked down at our joined hands, startled by the gesture. This wasn't part of our arrangement. There was no audience to perform for, no Arthur to convince. Yet here he was, offering the only comfort he knew how to give—his presence, his steadiness, his silent promise that I wasn't facing this alone.

For the first time since Dr. Thorne's call, my breathing began to slow. The trembling in my hands eased, though whether from his touch or his unexpected kindness, I couldn't say.

""Thank you,"" I whispered.

He squeezed my hand once, briefly, before returning his attention to the road. But he didn't let go.

We reached Presbyterian Hospital in record time, Axel's expensive car looking absurdly out of place in the visitor parking garage. He handed his keys to the valet without seeming to notice the young man's awed stare, his focus entirely on keeping pace with my hurried steps toward the elevator.

The surgical floor smelled like antiseptic and fear. Fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows down the sterile hallway as we made our way to the waiting area. I spotted Chloe immediately—she was pacing near the windows, her dark hair pulled back in a messy ponytail, worry lines etched deep around her eyes.

""Lila!"" She rushed toward me, pulling me into a fierce hug. ""I've been trying to call you. They took her in about an hour ago. Dr. Thorne said there was internal bleeding, something about the tumor shifting—""

She stopped mid-sentence, her gaze landing on Axel, who stood awkwardly behind me in his perfectly tailored suit. Her eyebrows shot up in surprise.

""Mr. Hawthorne?"" Chloe's voice was carefully neutral, but I could hear the confusion underneath. ""What are you doing here?""

Panic fluttered in my chest. I hadn't thought this through. How was I supposed to explain why my boss had driven me to the hospital at nine o'clock at night? Why he was standing in a family waiting room like he belonged there?

""He... he offered to drive me,"" I stammered, my cheeks burning with embarrassment. ""When he heard about Mom… We were in office, and he insisted on coming. It was very kind of him.""

Chloe's sharp eyes moved between us, taking in details I prayed she wouldn't notice. The way Axel stood protectively close to my shoulder. The fact that we'd arrived together, clearly having left from the same place. The slight redness around my eyes that suggested I'd been crying in his presence.

""That's... unusually generous,"" she said slowly, her gaze lingering on Axel's face. ""Most bosses would just send flowers.""

Axel cleared his throat, seeming to realize he needed to contribute to this charade. ""Lila is a valued employee. When family emergencies arise, I believe in supporting my staff.""

The words were perfectly reasonable, professionally appropriate. But something in his tone—too careful, too measured—made Chloe's eyes narrow slightly. She was a nurse; she was trained to notice when people were hiding something.

""Well,"" she said after a moment, ""I suppose we should all sit down and wait for news.""

As we settled into the uncomfortable plastic chairs, I caught Chloe studying us with the focused attention of someone putting together a puzzle.

My heart hammered against my ribs as I avoided her eyes, praying that she would not start asking questions I wasn't prepared to answer.",1,1758332848.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I only used chat gpt for a punctuation check but that was it. All the words are my own which isn’t anything super impressive but just wanted to mention that. Anyways, enjoy the story.


The Man

The obnoxious sound of Jack’s alarm clock jolted him awake at 8 a.m. Slow and sluggish in an attempt to roll himself out of bed, he noticed from his bedroom window that it was raining. A sense of subtle joy overtook him, for he loved the rain.

He couldn’t come to a conclusion for his liking of the stormy weather, but he felt it on days like this. Jack made his way downstairs to grab a cup of coffee and see his parents, who had left for their week’s vacation to Sicily, Italy. “Oh, yeah,” he thought to himself, forgetting they left around 5 a.m. for their 8 a.m. flight this morning. Jack didn’t work and had no obligations in the home for the most part. He was a good and respectful kid, though he had no sort of inclination to work. Entertainment and indulging in hedonistic pleasures was almost a daily routine for him since graduating high school. The priorities he would have after leaving his parents’ home—finding his passions and the question of what career path he would venture into—was too daunting to answer. He was all too comfortable.

Jack was in the kitchen grabbing the coffee his parents made earlier in the morning. He proceeded and started making toast, poured himself a heaping bowl of Apple Jacks, and made his way into his room to play some games on his Xbox. The type of games he enjoyed were first-person shooters like Call of Duty, along with a few cups of coffee just to get himself awake. Jack aspired to be a skilled gaming personality since streaming was now so prevalent. The success of many YouTube creators and gamers Jack grew up watching motivated that vision he had for himself. The rain began to pour down harder, with echoes of thunder nearby. In the midst of his gaming, Jack noticed he felt a sense of comfort. Besides the coziness he felt on days like this, the rain also gave him a sense of relief from his complacency, knowing others were inside as well due to the stormy weather. “Most people are probably having some sort of leisure time as well,” he thought. 

As Jack continued playing his games and eating what was left of his cereal, he was interrupted by a few knocks at the front door. He ignored it at first, not wanting to answer to some salesman or neighbor so he continue with his leisurely morning in peace. He knew it was wrong but his laziness overtook him frequently. He heard more knocks again, just as the first. Out of annoyance, he removed his headset and tossed it onto his bed, got up from his chair, and made his way downstairs to answer the door. It was a FedEx driver with a package who requested a signature of approval. It was for his father, whose name was Richard Campbell. Jack made a lousy attempt at his signature on the driver’s tablet; the man thanked him, nodded, and was off.

Jack peered to the right over at his friend Stephen’s house to see if he was home, since he hadn’t texted him to play games yet. There were no cars in his driveway nor on the street in front of his home. Jack acknowledged he must be at his community college classes today. He decided not to text him until evening to join him to play Call of Duty. Outside was murky, and it was still raining considerably hard. Jack closed the door and went back inside.

After setting the box down, he saw his car keys on the counter, reminding him he should grab a snack for later, knowing he would want something while gaming with Stephen. He pondered where to go as he quickly threw on shoes and a coat, left, and walked to his old 1999 Honda Civic parked in the driveway. The rain settled a bit but was still more than a light drizzle. Jack lived in the suburbs of Huntington Beach, California, in a safe neighborhood, home to many middle-class families and a select few of the wealthy. His parents did quite well for themselves, so you could say Jack’s family lived modestly. Jack started driving to his local 7-Eleven a few minutes away, where he went roughly every other day. He knew the clerk since childhood, but the man strangely never said a word; as he recollected the thought, he smiled at the realization.

He approached the driveway entrance, and it was packed even in the rain, yet it was close to lunchtime, so he parked several spots from the store that were available. Mildly annoyed, he got out to walk inside and noticed a peculiar man—not homeless-looking, but rummaging through the trash, clearly looking for something. He was roughly six feet tall, wore a large jacket, denim pants, and a strange hat that was almost fitting for the outfit. Jack walked up and hesitated, seeing the man was partially blocking the door. He tried circumnavigating his way around him to go inside without notice. Then the man peered right, noticing Jack, and said,

“Sir, sir, have you seen a knife anywhere? You know, one that flips out and it’s about this big,” gesturing oddly with his hands.

“No, I haven’t. I just got here,” Jack replied, confused.

The man replied back, “Oh…” and proceeded to look. Jack opened the door, and before closing it the man said a bit louder, “You sure?” He had a pocket knife in his hand, as he’d described a second ago, and said, “It was in my coat pocket on my right side the whole time.”

“I never checked it!” he yelled out, followed by some uncanny laughs, hardly breaking eye contact with Jack.

“Glad you found it,” Jack said nervously. He closed the door quickly, considering telling the clerk to call the police. The clerk was in the corner near the back door, texting—unaware of anything that had just happened at the front with the man. Jack looked back at the man; he was walking off, so Jack decided to get his things quickly, check out, and go home. In a haste, and while taking constant glances at the front entrance and glass windows for the man, Jack grabbed a bag of BBQ Ruffles chips, a Hundred Grand chocolate bar, and an original Red Bull in the span of ten seconds. He went to pay and considered telling the clerk about the man and the interaction but didn’t, due to being in a hurry to leave. He bought his things and said, “Have a good one.”

The clerk didn’t say anything except for a nod of acknowledgement. Jack noticed the man was not to be seen as he walked out from the store, but as he walked a few steps he spotted him sitting in a black Jeep Cherokee a few spots from him. He walked speedily to his car to leave and suddenly the man, a few paces away, noticed him again, calling out, “Hey, kid!”

“Thanks for the help anyway. Who knows what I would’ve done tonight. I don’t have much money. I’m pretty forgetful, wouldn’t you say?” he added, now looking at Jack with that strange look as before, except this time almost grinning and not breaking eye contact again.

Jack didn’t respond; he just needed to get into the car. He didn’t know what that was and didn’t care to find out by entertaining that conversation. He started to pull out, trying his best to avoid looking at the man still parked. He left and, while driving, felt an acute sense of paranoia that the man might be following him, not knowing what to expect at this point. As he started driving, the rain began to pick up again, setting the mood for something unsettling like this—coincidentally. He persisted, peering into his rearview window the entire way back home.
Jack was having a hard time shaking the image of the man’s grin and creepy interaction they had.


What felt like an eternity, Jack was finally back to the house pulling into the driveway. Getting out of the car, he made his way to the front door, then immediately stopped and felt the need to put his car in the garage. He just didn’t want to be noticed, even though he felt his precautions of being seen were a bit dramatic. He got back in the car and pulled into the garage.

“I’m an idiot,” he thought, going through scenarios in his head and concluding it could’ve just been a strange man looking for his knife who was too talkative. “I don’t know, man—the way he looked at me was almost menacing, but regardless, that was sketchy,” he thought, almost finding room for humor in the situation. He felt relieved to be home at least and clicked the button to close the garage. Just as the garage was  beginning to close, he saw a black car drive by and made a momentary flash of eye contact with a man driving, wearing a hat, who gazed inside at him as the garage door was creeping down about a quarter of the way. The garage now made its way shut.

Jack couldn’t tell with certainty if it was the man from earlier, but seeing a black car and the man inside appearing to wear a hat made his stomach sink and his body tense up with fear. His heartbeat raced for a brief moment at the eerie thought of the man passing by. Consequently, his mind started to piece together a bunch of reasons not to be worried. Thinking the man from earlier knew where he lived became the only thing he could think about. “What if he pulled back around and he’s in front of the house looking for me?” he thought. He frantically locked the garage door and took his bag of snacks up to his room, where he sat for a while, listening to the rain and looking out his bedroom window for anybody that could be at the house. There was nobody to be seen except for a few passing cars and the empty neighborhood.

Jack didn’t want to scare his parents by telling them what happened while they were so far away in Italy, so he texted Stephen and explained the situation. Thirty minutes went by with no response. Hours went by and Jack never left his window in fear of the man coming. He decided to get back on his games without his headset in order to hear anything going on outside that would raise any alarm in him. Stephen finally texted back just as Jack hopped into his first match of a different game called Fortnite. He felt partially relieved looking at Stephen’s text saying, “That’s creepy, man. I don’t think he’s out to get you though haha. Wanna hop on some games in a while?” “I’ll be home in a couple of hours.”

Jack knew Stephen couldn’t have known the severity of the situation, having not experienced it. “How could he not be creeped out and paranoid if he were in my shoes right now?” he thought. He would, Jack concluded, and the same worries came back and began to persist. A couple worried hours later he hopped on the games with Stephen around 7 p.m. Stephen had a long day of school and had gone out to dinner with some girl he recently met. As they were both playing Fortnite, Stephen asked, “Anything else happen since we talked?”

“Not really,” Jack replied. “I just keep thinking about it, but honestly I think I was tripping myself out thinking about it too much, if you know what I mean.”

“Yeah, I’m glad you answered my call and the guy didn’t get you,” Stephen replied jokingly.

Jack laughed and said, “No, for real—you should’ve seen me. I ran up to my room looking out the window for hours, thinking the dude was after me or something. Call me a lunatic or whatever, but in the moment I was ready to fight this guy if he pulled up to the house.”

“No, you wouldn’t,” Stephen said, laughing. “You’d be under your bed texting 911, let’s be real.”

“Nahhhh,” Jack said sarcastically, knowing he was probably right. They both laughed.

They continued playing for hours until Stephen had to go finish homework he was doing last second for his morning history class. They hung up the phone, and Jack was now alone but was left more at ease—either from Stephen’s jokes and downplaying the situation, poking fun at Jack’s overreaction, or just having another person to talk to to alleviate the end of Jack’s seemingly chaotic day.

There wasn’t much else to do. He had already talked to his parents that night and caught up on how things were going. He went to bed shortly after playing a few more games. The rain was settled but kept coming about in intermittent spurts. Something woke him—he heard a thud or a crack in the house he couldn’t make out, being mostly asleep. It wasn’t unusual for that to happen, he thought, and brushed it off. He then heard the sound of a car out front, and it was a neighbor pulling in across the street. Even after Jack’s relief, he still felt on edge and on high alert. The couple of sounds seemed to revive some anxiety that had vanished earlier. Lying in his bed, he looked out again, then one more time a few moments later out of paranoia and a last attempt of reassurance he could sleep soundly.

Another snap, the same as before, was heard in the house, only further. He nervously got up to investigate. In extreme hesitation, he poked his head looking towards the dim hallway. Jack gained some confidence and scoured the upstairs while turning the lights on. He looked out the windows of his parents’ room at the backyard, then peered out over the railing down to the downstairs hallway. I guess the house is just creaking and I’m being a little girl about it? Jack thought. In frustration, he turned the lights off, shut his bedroom door, locked it, and went to bed.

The midnight rain began to pick up again and into the night. It persisted as a soothing white noise, with Jack’s window being cracked. His frustrations before bed allowed him to put his worries behind him and sleep like the man of a household does—comfortably, but with one eye open, as they say. During Jack’s sleep, the sound of a slow-moving vehicle could be heard pulling up just across the street.

The sound of the car being put into park was enough to wake him again. Jack took a second to peer out his window, being as tired as he was and now flustered. He looked out and saw it was a black Jeep Cherokee parked on the other side of his house. His heart raced and he looked away from the window. Is it the guy? he asked himself with the utmost fear now settling in him. His hands were clammy, he went to look again, but nobody got out. The windows to the car were dark and he couldn’t make anything out from where he was. He laid back in bed, terrified of the thought of knowing the person saw him look out. If it was the man, then I assume he saw me trying to see if it was him. Knowing full well I’m terrified. What is this!? he thought to himself angrily and fearfully.

A car door then opened and shut, Jacks head lay against the wall on the foot of his. He couldn’t bear himself to look. Footsteps a moment later made their way toward the house in an offbeat rhythm and veered off to the left and stopped. Jack boldly made a peek out the window and couldn’t see anybody. What? What!? he said to himself quietly in immense confusion. Is he sneaking up on me? Jack wanted to confirm the front door was locked but couldn’t in fear of leaving his room. His mind was in right or flight. He needed to hear what was going on.

“Where did the man go?” Jack said quietly to himself, trembling. He could barely move a muscle, being too nervous to take a single step. He didn’t want a remnant of sound to be heard from his room. He sat there waiting and listening closely.

The faintest sound of the front door slowly swinging open could be heard from downstairs. Jack nearly fainted, his heart was beating out of his chest. He didn’t think the door was really unlocked but it had been. He stayed put in his room silently, with his whole body intensely sweating as the trepidation of the man below consumed him. 

There was no sound to be heard. Jack tried sliding his window open slowly while in a shaky haze, listening attentively to the sounds below. He quietly got the window fully open, and he waited there. The silence was ominous thing—it was unbearable. The man could suddenly be heard running to and up stairs. Jack froze, unable to move and the man now tried forcing the door open but couldn’t. Jack, still on the verge of screaming and fainting, noticed the man stopped. He heard him shuffle back a few paces away from the door. 

Jack, on the verge of collapse, listened, then—Snap!

Jack let out a yell. The man’s foot blasted through the door, making a huge opening, and the man got down on a knee to reach his left arm through the hole and up to unlock the latch on the other side of the door. He fiddled with the lock and pushed  the door open. Jack instinctively drew himself to the window, climbed out to the edge, and without much hesitation leaped from the second-story window to the grass. He rolled on his shoulder hard enough to feel quite injured on getting up, but he still had the ability to run for his life.

The man’s loud footsteps could be heard running down and smacking the wooden stairs in pursuit of Jack, who made a run for it as fast as he could. He made his way sprinting down the harrowing street of his neighborhood and could see the man in the distance wildly running after him. Jack almost started crying and yelled out, “Help!” loudly a couple of times as he tried keeping a steady gap between him and the man.

There wasn’t much use—the fact was nobody was awake to be immediate help. Jack kept his pace and he began to lose the man behind him, making his way around the corner to his local park. The man relentlessly followed around the corner, but Jack was already most of the way through the park passing pine trees and the dark empty playground. He now entered the other side of the neighborhood.

Exhausted from running, Jack now made it a few blocks down and hid behind some shrubs bordering the front of a neighbor’s house without being seen. “I’ll lay here and watch for a while”, he said, covered in sweat. His stomach and his arms now resting on the dirt, he laid there and watched from behind the shrub, hidden. Jack sat there lying for a few minutes until finally, the man—who he could see now was the one from before: six feet tall, the same jacket and denim pants along with a strange hat, was looking around aimlessly in search for Jack, now looking frustrated. Nearing closer in Jack’s direction, he could hear the man muttering words and swearing to find him.

“That fucki— that fucking kid, I’ll find him and kill him.”

His delirious state of mind and words just spoken startled Jack immensely. He couldn’t believe that was the same man from yesterday. He couldn’t believe he actually had vile intentions the entire time. It was all a sick trick, he thought to himself, thinking back to yesterday, trembling again. He watched as the man continued on, so Jack reached for his phone. It was at home on his bed.

“Damnit!” he whispered. “It makes sense—I did leave suddenly, but not grabbing it at a time like this?”

Jack allowed for a few more minutes to pass with the idea in mind to make his way back home, hoping he could build up the courage to. A few more minutes passed—it was time. He slowly crept upward about halfway, making a few glances of confirmation and started walking toward the street. He wanted to run, but if the man was near he thought he’d run into him unexpectedly or draw attention to the sound of himself if he wasn’t walking cautiously. The streetlights gave an incandescent and eerie feel as he made his way along down the street towards the park. It had stopped raining as before but a light sprinkle could be felt as Jack proceeded for home.

He passed through the park to his side of the neighborhood. Not once had a car passed he noticed, and at an instant, a cat made its way across the street, startling Jack. He continued walking and his steps grew at a faster pace as he was approaching his house looking around both sides of the street, paranoid. He ran up, locked the front door with haste, and quickly got upstairs. He grabbed his phone from his bed and walked downstairs. He was peering out the living room windows, keeping watch for the man, as he called 911.

He saw something outside—he couldn’t make it out, it was hard to tell in the dark of night what it was. “Hurry and pick up please , please” he said, with extreme impatience. The operator answered. “Hello, this is 911, what is your emergency?”

Jack gave a quick summary of what happened at 7-Eleven with the mysterious man. He quickly summarized the initial interaction, the man passing moments later in his car, seeing his house, and the later visiting him that evening and how he snuck up into the house, to his room and chased him out and down the street. The operator listened attentively taking notes and asking further questions.

“Can you give me a description of what this man looks like?”

Jack turned away from the window, giving the reply. 

The man was staring at Jack with his hallow eyes, creeping from behind the corner wall of the kitchen who’d been waiting for him to enter the house to kill him. He was smiling insanely, his body mainly exposed by the kitchen wall with his pocket knife in hand.

“Ahhhhhhh!” Jack screamed and cried, dropping his phone. He picked up a two-foot candlestick stand nearest to him at the window. 

The man took a step forward, making himself fully visible, and ran at Jack with a sinister and crooked look. Jack swung as he neared, hitting his side. The man tried grabbing Jack’s shirt, but Jack barely slipped away l running toward the dining table. The man followed laughing, running around swinging his knife towards Jack, slashing his arm from across the table. Jack yelled out in pain as he got into a desperate position away toward the far side of the table. The clean slash on his arm was bleeding badly. The table gave a few feet of distant between them. The man stood there wide eyed and suddenly climbed up on top knocking everything over on the table. He stepped over toward Jack in another attempt to grab him but Jack smacked his arm away and ran toward the stairs. The man leaped off the table running quickly after him.

The man was faster and caught up to Jack grabbing him by the shirt, ready to stab him near the top of the stairs. Jack then spun around quickly, in a full 180 degrees, and swung the candle stand with all his might and struck the man badly on the side of the head. The man immediately dropped to the steps at Jacks feet, bleeding, and tumbled down to the bottom of the stairs to the living room floor. He lay there unconscious. 

Jack started sobbing profusely. “What just happened?” He said as he continued sobbing in shock of everything and what he just did to the man. This went on for a moment but then couldn’t endure another second of being at the top of the stairs looking down at the man. He didn’t know for sure if he was dead or not but he appeared like it. Jack ran down the stairs, wiping his tears, and grabbed the knife off the floor that the man dropped after being hit, and called 911 again. He made the call from the sidewalk, looking into his house with the front door open.

He was traumatized and couldn’t bear being in the vicinity of the man who was likely dead. The cops were stunned by the situation. Jack’s parents and his friends later couldn’t believe what happened that night. Most of all, Jack couldn’t believe it. He was sitting there partially in delirium and a haze as the authorities made their way inside to investigate the scene. Jack stayed outside with a few cops who comforted him and asked a series of questions. He then received assistance from a peri medic to address his gash on his arm from getting cut earlier. The man was declared dead due to the mighty blow to the head with the candle stand. Jack was thinking how such a seemingly perfect day turned into a nightmare yet how lucky he was to have managed to stay alive. He thought how going to a 7 Eleven now wouldn’t be the same anymore or even just being at home alone. The prior worries Jack had of the man were now justified with the event’s that played out that evening. This moment never departed Jack’s memory, but the lasting trauma improved with time, and he went on to venture into those things we mentioned in the beginning of the story with success.

That day Jack learned a couple things: trust your instincts and never, never leave your front door unlocked.

The End.

1nllmdu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nllmdu,"[GF] Surprise, surprise. 🫣🤭","I just want to share yung surprise ng girlfriend ko yesterday. Twice ko na siyang hindi sinasadyang mahuli tuwing magbibigay siya ng flowers. First was noong birthday ko. I was looking for water sa Airbnb tapos nagulat ako pagbukas ng ref, may malaking bouquet doon. I acted na parang hindi ko nakita noong binigay niya yung flowers, then told her later on na I already knew about it. Hahahahahahahahaha. Sabi niya, ‘Bakit ka naghahanap ng water sa ref?’ na parang kasalanan ko pang nauhaw ako? 😭 Charing.

Second was yesterday. Napaaga uwi ko kasi walang traffic sa EDSA (surprisingly). Papasok na ako ng condo building nung nagkasalubong kami sa entrance. She told me na kukunin lang niya yung coffee na pina-deliver niya tapos pinipilit niya akong sumama. Nagalit pa siya bakit daw ang aga ko umuwi, eh usually daw one hour yung travel time ko dahil sa traffic. 😭 Sumama ako hanggang sa labas tapos nakita ko yung flowers. HAHAHAHAHA. Sabi ng guard, “Wala na, ma’am. Nakita na niya yung regalo mo sa kanya.”

Hay. Ang swerte ko sa girlfriend ko kahit na lagi ko siyang nahuhuli sa flowers na binibigay niya sa akin. Ang cute lang na we’re both femmes tapos nagbibigayan lang kami ng flowers on random days and special occasions. I love you, honey my love so sweet! 💛

1nllkkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nllkkn/aio_fiancé_called_the_cops_on_me/,AIO? Fiancé called the cops on me,"I’ve been extremely stressed with work, and he got his feelings hurt because I said that I enjoy the peace and quiet at my house (I still own a house in town, and stay there on occasion if I have a lot of work to do-we live an hour away from where I work) and it was just general conversation and I said “to be honest the only thing I enjoy there is the peace and quiet”. BUT he immediately took it the wrong way. I tried to explain what I meant but he wouldn’t hear it. What person doesn’t appreciate that sometimes?
Fast forward to bed time and I try to talk to him about it when we are lying there. He immediately starts saying he doesn’t want to argue, I tell him I’m not trying to, but that we should talk about earlier. It goes south. He says no matter what he tried to do to help me tonight, my demeanor didn’t change…I don’t see what he does, etc. all NOT true. He wasn’t hearing it-we have communication issues. I said that everything he does helps. And I even apologized earlier before I had even made the peace and quiet comment, that I realized that I was having a tough time, that I was sorry and that I am doing my best not to be in a bad frame of mind. 
I end up having a panic attack in bed. He feels bad and starts holding me. As I’m having my panic attack, he feels it’s a good time to start telling me how his ex wife would act this way…tells me he thinks I don’t want to be here and that I haven’t for a long time. Also NOT true. I am always thanking him etc. so I’m not sure why he is like this. During this, I can’t get comfortable and sit up to pull my pillow to. He’s on it so I say I need my pillow pls, as I pulled. He leans forward so I can get it. I lay down and fall asleep finally. 
Next morning, I’m sitting with my coffee falling asleep bc of last night. I’m tired. He says something about the Alexa, I don’t answer immediately and take few seconds before I do answer, he says so I guess we’re ignoring each other now. I said no, I was half asleep when you asked. It took me a second to realize what you were saying. Then, he says, you pushed me away last night and made me hit my head on the headboard. Umm, I don’t recall doing that so I say what and excuse me? Bc he says it and then promptly leaves the room. I follow him. I’m trying to ask him what happened and saying I never did that so what does he mean? He knows this is not good for me. I don’t do well with him walking away like that. I try to talk to him and he says you did this and none of it needed to be this way…I get pissed bc at this point, he knows I am completely stressed and that he is pushing my buttons. He knows. Tried to slam the door, and I push it open. He continued to treat me like shit, told me to get out of his house (it’s our home and has been for over two years). I knocked a chair over and broke the vacuum. I’m breaking down obviously not doing well at all but he keeps pushing. He came at me and I pushed him away. He calls the cops and I end up locking myself in our room to get away from him. He keeps repeating that I pushed him. 
This is a man who has been mentally unstable for a while, who has actually gotten so close to me, spitting mad that he has literally spit in my face and pushed me with his body, daring me to hit him. He has also slapped and punched himself in his own head several times in front of me, even though I’ve begged him not to do that because it makes me feel very uncomfortable. It’s like he’s doing that instead of hitting me. 
So, I tell the cops I’m fine and just want to be left alone. They leave. He makes a huge deal about how I’m not going to lock him out of his own room and that I better let him in. I finally do. He then proceeds to remove the locks from our doors. Say he pays the mortgage here and won’t be locked out if his own damn room. 
Next day, literally as I am waking up, (I slept in the next room) he tells me that he didn’t file a restraining order on me bc he loves me. WTF? I said, did cops suggest that? He said no, but I’m just saying I didn’t bc I love you. Also you scratched my face when you pushed me but I just told them you’re dealing with a lot. WHAT?! 
He’s pushed me to my mental limits so much but this time was the worse. I’m prior law enforcement so this was also very embarrassing for me. We live in a very small town. 
It almost seemed like he wanted me to get upset! Knowing how much work stress I’ve been under, I really feel he made all of this way worse than it needed to be. But accuses me of the same. He is very insecure and absolutely has a victims mentality, and makes me feel like I’m going crazy bc I know I can’t be “the one who always starts arguments “, “the one who needs help”, etc, as he says I am. I know that I am not perfect but I am so drama free and just try to be happy, but he seems to always think something is wrong. Likes to tell me how I feel based on his assumptions. I must not want this life with him…even our dogs stress me out…yes I AM stressed. It’s been 10 years. Idk if I can move forward from this. Am I overreacting? Is there anything left to do at this point? Every time we get into it, I tell myself that the next time this happens, will be the last. Yet, somehow I accept his apology because he always apologizes and he always feels bad, but this time really truly feels different. I feel very betrayed and also very angry. Icing on the cake, this home of ours is my dream home and I’ve put my everything into it. Literally done 80 percent of the work, paint, tile, everything. It absolutely breaks my heart. But every time I think of the words “restraining order”, I get so pissed. I’m having a very hard time with this. ",1,1758332470.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

1nllg33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1nllg33/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke. It was our song remastered",1,1758332103.0,Tik_tok_stories,0,1.0,False
1nlle56,https://www.reddit.com/r/diypedals/comments/1nlle56/coffee_can_diy_effect/,Coffee Can DIY Effect,"I was at a party about 15 years ago, and it was a party for talented musicians where everybody brought booze and gear and jammed long into the night.  It was an amazing evening, but one thing stood out to me that may be relevant to this group.  There was one guy there who claimed to be a backup guitarist for the Rolling Stones, i.e. the guy behind the curtain who kept the guitars set up and took over rhythm parts while the guitarists on stage were soloing.  This fella had a home grown guitar effect that he was very proud of - something involving a coffee can.  He was a very talented guitarist, and what he was doing throughout the drunken jam sounded terrific.  But what I am most interested in is what he was doing electronically with the coffee can.  He was very proud of the fact that he had home grown something that others can only pay for with their commercial guitar pedals.  Any ideas?  I did not get to examine his device closely (he was protective), nor can I report much about what affects it was providing.  His playing was not overly driven or fuzzy, so maybe that device was providing a bit of reverb and/or twang.  Any speculation is welcome!

Edit:  I am fairly sure the coffee can being made of metal (tin?) was important to the effect.",1,1758331939.0,diypedals,9,0.67,False

1nllb3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1nllb3y/haul_reviews_area_of_effect_and_cocoapink/,Haul Reviews: Area of Effect and CocoaPink!,"Hello, IMAM! Recently, I ordered from Area of Effect’s [discontinuation sale](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1nc0gqx/my_area_of_effect_order_arrived/)—specifically, five fragrances that were on my to-test list for a *very* long time that I wanted to try before they were gone forever. I got 3mL of each. Before that, though, I had placed a [very large sale order](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1ngcwe1/comment/ne4sros/) with CocoaPink, which included oil samples, linen sprays (both of which were re-orders), scrubs, and a hair conditioner.

Disclaimer: When I test and write fragrance reviews, I don’t double-check the notes list beforehand, operating solely on my perception (though I ostensibly had chosen these fragrances because of their notes).

Now, on to the reviews!

**Area of Effect**

I don’t see Area of Effect discussed often on this sub, so I’d like to introduce them first before I get into the fragrances themselves. They’re on the “nerdier” end of the indie spectrum, so to speak, with all their fragrances inspired in some way by gaming (tabletop, video, etc.). Several fandoms have been represented over the years: *Dungeons & Dragons*, *Portal*, *Stardew Valley*, *Legend of Zelda*, you name it. Apparently, every several years they prune the general catalog (the only catalog) to make room for more creations, so they announced the discontinuation of several scents… and five of them were high up on my to-test list. Here they are:

“Cheat Code” – *maple syrup, smoky bacon, cake donut*

This was the craziest one (I remembered the notes, they’re pretty unforgettable), so it’s the first one I went for. When the first note to hit my nose was icing, I admittedly got a little nervous because that’s usually a death note for me. Strangely enough, however, it wasn’t too sweet/cloying. After nearly two hours, a different note comes to the fore… meat. It is not immediately discernable what kind of meat, or the cut, but it is definitely a meatiness that joins the sweet, lol. This is such a very strange ride.

Rating: **4**/5 – donuts… for dinner?

“Constitution” – *brownie, raspberry, peanut butter, vanilla bean*

This one was at the top of the list—one that I put off trying again and again, until it was almost too late. I love raspberries, I love chocolate… why wouldn’t I love this?

Well, I can tell you that the chocolate comes through nice and clear. What is much fainter, however, is the raspberry note. It’s not fresh and bright, like it is in Stone & Wit “Cipher” (my current indie benchmark for raspberry notes), but neither is it syrupy sweet (like I encountered with NAVA) nor a Jolly Rancher (CocoaPink). It’s… surprisingly quiet. There isn’t much evolution to this composition, but the best way I can describe this is like someone broke open a Ghirardelli raspberry-flavored chocolate square, and you realize half the square has air inside.

Only when I copied the notes list for this post did I remember there was supposed to be peanut butter in here. Seriously, I didn’t get a whiff.

Rating: **3.5**/5 – perfectly pleasant, but not a favorite

“The Shamrock Taphouse” – *pumpkin pie, oatmeal, stout beer, green vines, clove, carrot cake, ginger*

This one is fandom-related, specifically *Fallout 4*, and I was hoping for something warm and comforting in the face of hostility. I tested this one twice, actually, because I was surprised at how mild it was. My skin seems to eat this up, but I vaguely detected pumpkin and clove, maybe allspice.

Rating: **2.5**/5 – Raiders took my Drinkin’ Buddy…

“XP” – *dark chocolate, espresso, peppermint, stout beer, vanilla bean*

I am a shameless lover of just about all things mint (which is a divisive note), so of course I wanted to try a peppermint offering. I got the peppermint right away, along with the chocolate, but it wasn’t like, say… Damask Haus “Andes Crème Candies” (I was worried it would end up being like a duplicate). It was more like Nui Cobalt “Hell Freezes Over,” actually, with the chocolate eventually becoming louder than the mint. AoE’s chocolate note is strong!

But then… something happened. The fragrance changed, and it unearthed a note that was almost berry-like—and actually stronger than the raspberry in “Constitution!” I still can’t quite place what the berry/fruity note is (and the notes list doesn’t reveal anything), but it’s a wonderful surprise.

Rating: **5**/5 – Yay, I leveled up and got more hit points!

“Continue?” – *espresso, pumpkin, spice, cream*

Here we have the free sample that came with my order. In all honestly, I think it smells remarkably similar to Fantôme “The Fox Sisters” (spicecake), but is much quieter. Basically, it’s a bridge between TFS and The Shamrock Taphouse,” and doesn’t have much evolution (though I’d say it’s better than TST)—so out of the two, I can see why “Continue?” would be the one sticking around.

Rating: **3.5**/5 – The cake is not a lie, per se… there’s just less of it.

“Dungeon Master” – *black coffee, bacon, stout beer, teakwood, eggnog, French toast, soft pretzel, clove, fir*

As the last of the fragrances from AoE that I tested, it was also the only one whose notes I’d truly forgotten. I recalled guessing that it would be the most masculine of the five, but not what I’d based that guess on. Anyway, I loved the spice hit when I applied this—similar to “The Shamrock Taphouse,” but louder where it needs to be, and less sweet. It’s the only one of the fragrances boasting a stout beer note where I can actually smell that dark, malty, hoppy, oat-filled mashbill. There’s a woodiness (coniferous) to this, as well, keeping it grounded. Finally, at the end of its life, there is a creaminess to this fragrance that I couldn’t immediately place. Looking at the notes list now… I think it’s eggnog!

Rating: **5**/5 – perfect for fall

**CocoaPink**

The Scrubs

I’m currently using “White Seashells” (*ruby red grapefruit pulp, Hawaiian white ginger, Kola Nut, succulent lychee fruit, sultry pikake all entwined within a mellow blend of pale musks*), and it smells surprisingly like suntan lotion. I wasn’t expecting that at all—in fact, what I was primarily expecting (grapefruit) is absent. I’m definitely getting mostly pikake (jasmine) and maybe the Kola Nut, it’s imparting a monoi oil vibe to the scrub. Smells like a tropical summer, but I won’t be getting this again.

I sniffed “Fear of Spiders” (*dragon’s blood resin, the memorable scent of fine pipe tobacco, chopped bundles of firewood, fragrant sprigs of wormwood and bright scarlet apples*), having expected something apple-forward. Instead, it’s *loaded* with spices! The dragon’s blood is working overtime. I hope the wormwood and apple come through upon application, once I start using this one.

The third scrub I got was a repeat, “Rosemary Mint” (*a crisp, minty herbal type with a peppermint and spearmint top note, a slightly herbaceous floral and rosemary middle note and a soft woody dry down*), one of the scents that can only be purchased through special sales. I love this stuff. It’s so soothing and comforting, and pretty much exactly what it says on the tin.

The Linen Sprays

I got two: one in the repeat order “Rosemary Mint,” which is perfect for my actual bed linens and the insides of my house slippers. The other is “Green Star” (*sparkling green notes of fennel and cypress, ensconced in velvety green musk, and earthed with roasted barley, incense, and the soothing rich warmth of ginger Co2*), which I’d adored as a perfume, but which was also so incredibly *fleeting*. It functions much better as this kind of spray, which I use as a room spray, and it is rather absinthe-like in its profile.

Now, on to the perfumes!

“Zest In Peace” – *a harmony of pink grapefruit, litsea cubeba, bergamot; with jasmine absolute, guaiacwood, patchouli, pink peppercorn, and moss; warmed by ambergris, ISO E super, and white musk*

CocoaPink did it. They actually did it. This is one of the new offerings as part of the 15^(th) Anniversary, and with it they somehow managed to make a lemon scent that wasn’t gourmand but also wasn’t house cleaner! That semisweet lemon comes from the litsea cubeba, and it really does smell like a whole lot of lemon zest floating on a cloud.

Not kidding, I want to bathe in this stuff. While it won’t be for a while, next time I order from CocoaPink I’m tempted to get a 10 mL oil (or even an EdP, perhaps?) along with a scrub.

Rating: **5555**/5 – zest in JOY

“Cherry Cola Float” – *a frosted glass filled with ice cold cherry cola with waves of sliced wild black cherries and vanilla bean ice cream*

Out of the vial, this one smells exactly like the name. I was impressed with the realism, and looked forward to smelling like an arcade or movie theater (in a good way, lol). The dry down is where this fell short, too much vanilla for me. At least it didn’t wind up smelling like medicine on me, unlike…

Rating: **2**/5 – too much float, not enough cola

“Cream Soda Slushie” – *ice cold cream soda, pear, caramel, butterscotch candies and fresh wild strawberries*

… Yeah, unlike this one.

This didn’t smell like cream soda to me. It actually smelled like *grape* soda at first, which was odd. After application, it turned medicinal and blech!

Rating: **0**/5 – At least I had enough scrubs to take care of this, lol.

“Gentle Tormentor” – *You are that wild-eyed faery’s child, beautiful and merciless. A bed of vanillas, tonka, and white musk, laced with delicate lemon and bergamot.*

This was a free sample, and one whose name intrigued me. I didn’t think it was on my to-test list, and I hoped it wasn’t some leathery BDSM thing (I’m allergic to birch tar, which often goes into leather accords—luckily, I’m not a huge leather fan to begin with). Good news (for me): it wasn’t leathery. Bad news: it was incredibly sweet. It opened like something between caramel popcorn and a Rise Krispies treat and didn’t really let up. The notes say there’s supposed to be some light citrus as well, but I got none of that.

Rating: **3**/5 – calling all gourmand lovers

“Black Sesame” – *A rich and roasted nuttiness for an airy, sophisticated gourmand. Waffle cone, roasted coconut Co2, buttercream, ethyl vanillin, chocolate, roasted barley, hazelnut, coffee bean Co2, bread, a pinch of salt, and ginger Co2.*

When my order first arrived, I opened these all up for a sniff—I couldn’t help myself. Well, the top of “Black Sesame” has a little bubble at the neck, and I made the mistake of blowing on it: when it popped, it splattered oil on my dresser! I quickly cleaned up, and for a good amount of time my room smelled like some sort of spiced peanut brittle.

On skin, this has a bit more nuance: the sweetness of waffle cone and toasted coconut are grounded with black coffee and whiffs of bread baking in the oven. Everything combines to create a vaguely sesame accord at the end. It’s a cozy fall fragrance without falling into the stereotypes.

Rating: **5**/5 – Why does smelling this make me think of lattes and black sand?

“They Will Tempt You” – *With soft fingers and softer kisses they’ll urge their sweets upon you. Resist, or be theirs forever. Coconut creams, Turkish delight, cardamom cakes, pistachio and anise caramels, all warmed by amber, myrrh, and musk.*

This was the last one I tested, and I had completely forgotten what it was supposed to smell like (the others mostly had clues in their names). Color me surprised when the opening note was hairspray—the same hairspray at the beginning of Pulp Fragrances “Hall of Mirrors” and “Witching Night,” as well as Damask Haus “MangoTango.” It’s a jolt of sophistication that settles into something sweeter than all the other fragrances. I would say the coconut and myrrh dominate once the musk and… rosewater (maybe?) finally settle. This is an excellent fragrance, but I already have something that does this for me.

Rating: **5**/5 – femme fatale

All right, that’s it, that’s my big ol’ haul! And now that I’ve reviewed them all, these are my final rankings (oil perfumes only):

1. Zest In Peace
2. Black Sesame
3. They Will Tempt You
4. Dungeon Master
5. XP
6. Cheat Code
7. Constitution
8. Continue?
9. Gentle Tormentor
10. The Shamrock Taphouse
11. Cherry Cola Float
12. Cream Soda Slushie (the lone scrubber)

In the household of the Barton family.

Claire was dressed in an exquisite gown, but she had a childish expression on her face.

She fiddled with the glasses on the coffee table and foolishly raised it to the person sitting opposite her. ""G... glass...""

As she spoke, she drooled from the corner of her mouth.

The cross-shaped scars on her face were even more difficult to ignore.

""To show his gratitude, he actually asked me to marry a fool?""

Tyree didn't pay attention to her at all. He quickly looked through all the reports in his hand and threw them aside. He was not having this.

This was especially so when he saw her IQ level of only 50 on the report, which upset him even more.

This woman was fair-skinned and beautiful, but she couldn't stop drooling from the corners of her mouth. The sight of her was revolting.

The butler explained, ""Your grandfather said that it was Claire who saved his life... so...""

A month ago, Mr. Barton went back to his hometown for a spiritual retreat, but he got lost in the deep mountains.

The Barton family sent out search parties for several days and nights, but they could not find him. After the rain had abated, Mr. Barton was carried out by a woman and he was in perfect health.

That woman was Claire Gregory.

""So he's using my marriage as a barter?""

Tyree looked up coldly and quickly got up from the sofa. He didn't even bother to look at Claire. He ordered, ""Take her out!""

""Mr. Tyree... but... but Ms. Claire is already your wife now!""

As the butler spoke, he quickly took out the marriage certificate.

He expected that Tyree would not agree, so Mr. Barton had prepared the marriage certificate in advance. It meant that this matter had been decided and there was no room for negotiation.

The atmosphere in the living room suddenly became silent.

Tyree snatched the marriage certificate from the butler's hand and looked through it. He was already furious and wished that he could tear the certificate into pieces with his slender hands.

The butler lowered his head, looking helpless.

It was widely known that Tyree was swift and powerful in the business world, but at the age of thirty-two, he was still single. There were rumours saying that he liked men.

Mr. Barton's action was just to crush the rumours.

However, who would have thought that Mr. Barton would actually arrange for a fool to be his wife!

""If you don't want anything to drink, do you want some candy?""

At this moment, Claire, who was beside the coffee table, suddenly came up to Tyree. She held a lollipop in her hand and stared at him with bright eyes.

As soon as they locked eyes, Tyree felt goosebumps all over his body.

He immediately held her hand down because he didn't like sticky things. He was obsessed with cleanliness. If the lollipop touched him, he would go crazy.

""Why are you still standing there? Take her away immediately! Go and clean her up!"" Tyree ordered the butler in a cold voice. He wanted to throw Claire to the side.

But before he could do anything, Claire suddenly hugged his arm and burst into tears. ""Honey, don't you want me anymore? I just wanted to feed you!""

She wiped her tears and snot with the back of her hands while crying. She also wiped her tears and snot on Tyree's suit.

Tyree was shocked.

The butler wanted to laugh but didn't dare to. He tried his best to hold back his laughter.

""Honey, don't take me away. I will be a good girl and listen to you!""

Claire looked weak, but she was actually quite strong. She was so strong that Tyree couldn't move his arm and his arm was even going numb from her strong clamp.

His facial expression got darker every time he heard Claire calling him ""honey"".",2,1758331384.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False
1nll7gg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Schizoid/comments/1nll7gg/i_get_uncomfortable_when_people_have_a_false/,I get uncomfortable when people have a false conception of me in their head,"I joke about this with my (only) friend, but I get so incredibly uncomfortable when someone has the wrong idea about me, even over stupid things. e.g. If I am drinking coffee at a weird hour, and a uni classmate remarks ""how do you drink that at this time, won't you shit your brains out?"", I get incredibly disgusted that they are imagining me shitting my brains out (even though this isn't really occurring, and I am aware of this).

Same goes for jokes where the punchline is you hypothetically doing something very shocking or vulgar. I'm okay with absurd and silly things, but anything else makes me awkward. I even get horribly embarrassed when someone mishears me say something raunchy, because it's as if I really said that in their perception.

I've been forcefully making myself reminisce on experiences that might carry emotional baggage, and what still hits a sore spot are times where someone remained friendly after developing romantic feelings for me, behaving differently but still claiming ""this is what friends do"" (when I was a teenager, and as my user flair shows I was stupid enough to believe it). The location of my betrayal was felt in the fact that in their mind I existed as their romantic partner when I in no way agreed. It's easily the most uncomfortable I've ever been made to feel.

At the same time, I realize that so much of social relations have to do with this sort of delusional believing, i.e. any one-sided dynamic. And I know 'you can never know what someone else experiences', or 'you cannot control others', etc. etc.

So, I wonder if in connecting to others socially, breaking out of your own bubble, or ""letting yourself go"", this necessitates giving up control; and do normal people remain aware of this the entire time? People just seem so immersed in the world, socially. I've never been immersed, nor have I ever believed a one-sided dynamic either.

Also, I don't mean just a 'I don't want to be perceived' kind of thing, because that's not entirely true for me.",9,1758331380.0,Schizoid,0,1.0,False

I keep thinking it’ll taper if I’m good. If I run my errands, if I answer emails, if I go to bed at responsible hours. But the ache has the discipline of a long-distance runner; it paces me. It knows all my routes. I pick up a gas station coffee that tastes like cardboard, under a chapel of fluorescent bulbs. The cashier calls me honey. 

I take night drives alone now and  rehearse what I’d say if we talked again. Something about how the hum under everything is still there, that low frequency that makes me check my phone before it buzzes. Do you feel it too? Do you ever think about me?

I try to be brave about it. I make it neat: I fold the hurt and put it on the shelf with the sweaters I never wear because winters don’t get cold enough here to justify them.

People keep telling me it will pass. Like weather. Like a thunderhead that throws itself against the prairie and then dissolves into a cool rinse. I park in the driveway and let the storm stall above me. I open the window and let the static in.

If this is forever, it will be a forever of small things. The jenga block in my door pocket. A death cab album. The way I still leave room on the counter for your keys when I come in.

I memorized the cracks in the asphalt the way I memorized your shoulder blades. If I pass a truck that looks like yours, I let my heart do whatever it wants. 

I’ll keep scanning the edges of every scene for you, pretending it’s about safety when it’s really about wanting. Choosing the ache over the blank. And when it feels too heavy, I’ll remember I’ve already carried it this far—that the town still glows stubborn, that the sky keeps breaking and mending every day.

1nll4z9,https://i.redd.it/s8g4rv0518qf1.png,"We are working on a new off the shelf, digital first, open source, modular HT.","Good morning everybody! My name is Ben, K7YVQ. This is the first post of many regarding a new radio that I (and others) are currently developing. Our goal is to start selling a commercially available radio to compete with the likes of Anytone, Baofeng, etc. I am sick of companies selling outdated hardware with bad, closed source software and lackluster updates and support. The majority of open source projects are not very beginner friendly, in many cases requiring hardware mods.



We aim to change that in our first radio, The HT-15. What will set this radio apart from competitors is:

* Fully open source, hardware and software
* Swappable radio module, allowing easy hardware upgradability (2M/70CM at launch)
* USBC charge and data, SD card, Kenwood style audio connector, removable battery
* Low-power E-ink display targeting 72+ hour standby time
* FM and M17 support at launch, with plans to support many other digital modes in the future such as DMR, P25 (depending on codec licensing)
* Ability for community to write and easily install “apps” that allow custom features or arbitrary digital mode development
* Usable “off the shelf”. We will be selling the radio as a complete unit (not just a devboard)
* Target price between $200 and $300, Selling all individual parts on our website for repairability

I (Ben) and my friend Zea have started this company. We are both in our 20s working in hardware/software engineering jobs and have been working on this behind the scenes for the majority of this past year. 

As of right now we have ordered our prototype hardware of the main board and have much of the software planned out. 

When this project is finished, it will remain open source, we will be selling the hardware on our website, maintaining and improving the code, and working on additional radio modules.

I am going to be posting regular development logs on our youtube channel, in addition to bringing y’all along on the process of starting a hardware business.

If you would like to follow along, links are at the bottom of this post.

If you would like to support development:

* tell people about what we are doing
* help review the schematics
* support us financially at the Buy Me a Coffee link on our website.

1nll43l,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1nll43l/how_should_i_handle_my_petty_coworkers/,How should I handle my petty coworkers,"Okay so this is so silly but I’ve somehow found myself in some weird one sided beef with my coworker. I (28f) share a private office with another coworker. My desk faces the door and directly outside my door is a cubicle. My other coworker D (M40 something) sits in that cubicle.  

A few months ago our program manager (our boss’ boss) suggested me and my office mate (f29) got lamps so we didn’t have to suffer under the fluorescent lights. Gave us explicit permission since we were in our own office instead of a cubicle. We both agreed and bought our own lamp to set by our desk. 

My lamp is set up directly in front of my desk so that it can illuminate my face for video calls. I’ve gotten multiple compliments as have my office mate. 

Well apparently this was a problem for D. I began hearing from other coworkers that he didn’t like it and it bothered his eyes. But D NEVER came to me about. I figured if it was really an issue he’d come to me directly and we could figure something out. But he didn’t.  

A few months go by and my supervisor asked to speak to me privately. Apparently, D complained to his direct supervisor and our program manager about the lamp and I was being told to move it out of view. I told them I could try to put it behind me instead but that it would likely cause a shadow during video calls. I also asked why he never came to me directly. She said she didn’t know and just asked me to figure out a way for it to be out of his view. 

I complied but after a few days behind my desk I moved it back to its original spot because it caused a shadow during video calls like I expected. However, I’ve been keeping my door slightly ajar so that it covered my lamp. 

For weeks I heard nothing so I figured that it worked for D. I was wrong. 

I was pulled aside again by my supervisor today and was told that D was still not happy about the lamp. I told her that he can’t even see it and I make sure that anyone who came in kept the door slightly ajar so that it covered the lamp. She was aware of this and so was Ds supervisor and our program manager. Everyone thinks it’s silly but because he made a complaint they had to address it. They didn’t really give me any further direction except to make sure it was still out of view. 

I went to D’s sup and asked her to tell him to simply communicate with me about the lamp if it was in view. She said that when he made his complaint my lamp wasn’t even ON! And that he didn’t believe I should have the lamp at all because of a policy that says we can’t. His sup tried to reason with him by saying that everyone in our office has things in at our desk that we aren’t suppose to have. She herself has a coffee pot in her office despite it being prohibited. D said he didn’t care about other people having prohibited objects. Just me. 

So I’ve already emailed my supervisor about my concerns of being targeted by him but I don’t know if I should escalate it further. I don’t want it to end with everyone be told to take things down because of me but I also don’t want him to continue to lodge complaints against me as it could ruin my chances of advancement. 

I find these complaints to be so unserious but I am a queer black woman with tattoos up against an older white Christian male. And I feel attacked.

Carl Luner was supposed to be a prisoner.
Instead, he awoke to silence.

The cryo pod hissed as it decompressed, thick mist curling from its edges like pale, grasping fingers. His breath came in sharp bursts, each inhalation scraping against his throat. Disoriented, shivering, he pried himself from the pod and staggered onto the cold metal floor. The station’s artificial gravity barely caught him, pulling just enough to remind him he wasn’t floating freely into the void.

A single, flickering strip of light ran along the ceiling. The hall stretched in both directions, repeating panels and doors blurring together into a corridor that seemed to grow longer the more he looked at it.

Something was wrong.

He pressed his palm to the comm panel. No response. Static hummed faintly, then—
Woooooaaaaaahhhhhnnn…

A low, sonorous tone slid through the silence, reverberating through the walls, through his ribs. It was… a song. Deep and mournful, impossibly vast. It sounded like it came from beneath him, from the belly of the station, from the bones of the metal itself.

Or beyond it.

He stumbled through the hallways, searching for anyone, anything. Barracks. Mess halls. Command decks. Every room was abandoned. Plates still full. Chairs toppled. Steam still rising from untouched coffee.

Where were the guards? The prisoners? The crew?

The station should have been teeming with life—or at least with the miserable shuffle of those awaiting slow death in this forsaken system. But Carl was alone.

Except for the song.

It came in waves now. Sometimes distant, a mere tremble underfoot. Sometimes deafening, as though something enormous had pressed its mouth to the outer hull and sang directly into the structure.

It gnawed at his nerves. He heard it in the pipes. In the hum of the lights. In the wet squelch of his boots when he crossed a corridor slick with condensation that hadn’t been there seconds before.

Time unraveled. Hours, maybe days passed—Carl wasn’t sure. He ate when he remembered. Slept when the song allowed him to. Often, when he awoke, the halls had shifted. Doors that had been sealed were now ajar. Corridors that once ended at bulkheads now stretched impossibly long, curving subtly in ways the blueprints never accounted for.

And the song was growing louder.

Carl found himself wandering the observation deck, drawn by something he didn’t want to name. He pressed his forehead to the viewport, clouded with frost.

At first, he thought they were storm clouds, great gray masses shifting in the ink of space.

But then the song crescendoed, vibrating through his bones, and the clouds moved—a graceful, colossal undulation, like the sweep of a tail, like the turning of something far too large to comprehend.

He wiped the fog from the glass with a trembling hand.

And he saw them.

Vast, glistening bodies drifting lazily through the void, their skin shimmering with impossible bioluminescence. Eyes—if they were eyes—rippled open along their flanks, sightless, ancient.

Whale-like, but not whales. Not creatures of water. Creatures of the cold vacuum.

Their mouths—huge and serrated—hung open as they sang, the sound tunneling through the station, pressing into Carl’s skull until it was no longer heard but felt, a resonance that replaced thought with sheer vibration.

He stumbled back, clutching his ears though it did nothing to stop the song. It was inside him now. Carried on frequencies not meant for human senses. A language he could not understand but could never forget.

The logbooks he found later confirmed it. The prisoners, the guards, the staff—they had heard it too. First in their dreams, then in the walls. Some had gone silent, catatonic. Others had clawed at the airlocks, desperate to join the song.

No one had survived.

Carl laughed—a hollow, broken sound.

He understood now. He had not been transported to this prison station by mistake.

He had been delivered.

A gift.
A morsel.
A new listener.

He pressed his forehead to the glass once more as the song deepened, as the bodies pressed closer to the station, circling it in a slow, beautiful spiral.

There was no escape. No rescue.

There was only the song.

For years, I had been unable to ""get going"" in the morning. I'd sleep repeatedly a million times, wake up stiff and groggy, and dive headlong into the insanity of email or coffee with no time to myself whatsoever. I often felt like I was dragging body, and head, through those first few hours.

I tried all the grand morning routines, the intense workouts, the long periods of meditation, the ice showers (bless the soul who can do those on a regular basis!). And while those are great for some, for me, they just caused me more stress and many times left me abandoning it after day three.

Then I stumbled upon this ridiculously simple habit: 2 minutes of gentle stretching in bed.

Yes, you read that right. We're not talking about a full yoga flow, or a workout routine, or even anything that requires getting out from under the covers. This is just a couple of minutes of light, intuitive stretching. Think of it as a little ""hello"" to your body. A few gentle twists, reaching your arms overhead, maybe a simple knee-to-chest stretch. Nothing strenuous, nothing timed, just moving what feels a little tight.

And the effect? It's genuinely like hitting a reset button for my body and mind before the day even truly begins.

It's crazy how something so small can have such a big impact. It helps shake off the lingering sleepiness, loosens up those stiff joints, and creates this tiny pocket of mindfulness before the world rushes in. It's not about perfection; it's about giving myself that moment of gentle care. I find I'm more focused, less tense, and just generally in a better mood for whatever the day throws at me.

I shared a bit more about the specific stretches I do and why I think it works so well over on my profile, in case you're curious.

So, I'm curious to hear from all of you: What's your go to ""instant reset"" or super simple morning habit that makes a huge difference in your day? Let's share some easy wins!

1nlkywa,https://i.redd.it/mdoddb7tz7qf1.jpeg,MERIDIAN The Trimmer Premium - Body Hair Trimmer & Electric Shaver for Men and Women for Pubic Hair,"## Introduction: Let’s Talk Trimming (Without the Awkwardness)

Okay, let’s be real—**grooming your intimate areas** can feel like a high-stakes game. One wrong move with a cheap razor, and boom: razor burn, ingrown hairs, or worse… those painful nicks you remember for days. :/ That’s why when I first tried the **MERIDIAN The Trimmer Premium**, I was curious (and honestly a little skeptical). Could one device really work as a **pubic hair trimmer**, a **bikini trimmer**, and a general **body groomer** without the drama?

Spoiler alert: yeah, it actually does. But before I give away too much, let’s break this down together like two friends chatting over coffee. Sound good? :)

---

## Why Pubic Hair Grooming Needs the Right Tool

Ever tried using a regular razor “down there”? Not fun. The skin in those areas—whether it’s your groin, bikini line, or underarms—is way more sensitive than, say, shaving your face or legs. That’s where a **skin-safe trimmer for sensitive skin** comes in.

A good **intimate area trimmer** should:

* **Prevent ingrown hairs** (no one has time for those).
* **Avoid razor burn** with **no-nick trimmer blades**.
* Be **waterproof** (because shower shaving is life).
* Work for **men and women** (yep, unisex is the future).

And FYI, not every trimmer can pull this off. Some leave you red and irritated, while others sound like a lawnmower revving under your bathroom light.

---

## What Makes the MERIDIAN The Trimmer Premium Different?

So here’s the deal: the **Meridian trimmer** has built a bit of a cult following, and after using it, I get why. It’s marketed as a **manscaping trimmer**, but IMO it’s way more than just that.

### Key Features That Actually Matter

* **Ceramic blade trimmer** → stays sharp, reduces irritation, and avoids pulling hair.
* **Skin-safe technology** → you can use it as a **ball trimmer**, **bikini trimmer**, or even a **Brazilian trimmer** without flinching.
* **Waterproof body hair trimmer** → use it in the shower or on dry skin.
* **Rechargeable body trimmer** → cordless with solid battery life.
* **Adjustable guard trimmer** → lets you customize your trim length.
* **Low noise hair trimmer** → doesn’t sound like you’re starting a weed whacker at 7 a.m.
* **Travel friendly trimmer** → compact enough for your gym bag or suitcase.

👉 Want to check it out for yourself? Here’s the **Meridian The Trimmer Premium** on Amazon: [MERIDIAN Trimmer on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4narbX8).

---

## My Experience: The Good, The Great, and the “Wow Okay”

I’ll be honest—I’ve tested a few **groin trimmers** before. Some worked fine, but many left me with tiny cuts or an itchy rash later. The first time I used the **Meridian The Trimmer Premium**, I noticed how smooth the glide felt. No pulling, no scary “oops” moments.

* On the **bikini line**, it handled like a pro.
* For **chest and leg hair**, it zipped through without clogging.
* And yep, even as a **ball shaver** (sorry for TMI), it stayed nick-free.

Ever wondered why this works so well? The ceramic blades don’t heat up or tug, which makes a massive difference in **sensitive skin trimmers**.

---

## Meridian vs Manscaped: Which One Wins?

I know what you’re thinking—*Isn’t Manscaped the king of manscaping?* Fair question. Let’s compare.

### Meridian Trimmer

* **Unisex design** → works for men and women.
* **Hypoallergenic blade trimmer** → gentle on sensitive skin.
* **Travel-friendly and waterproof** → great for showers or trips.

### Manscaped Trimmer

* Marketed heavily toward men.
* Slightly bulkier design.
* Comparable performance, but some users say it’s harsher on sensitive areas.

**IMO:** If you want a **unisex body trimmer** that’s versatile for pubic hair, bikini lines, and beyond, the **Meridian trimmer** edges out.

---

## Where Can You Use It? (Short Answer: Pretty Much Everywhere)

This isn’t just for **groin shaving**. The **Meridian trimmer** doubles as a **chest hair trimmer**, **underarm trimmer**, and even a **back hair trimmer with attachments**.

Here’s where it shines:

* **Groin & Bikini Line** – safe for pubic hair.
* **Underarms** – smooth without irritation.
* **Legs (for women)** – works like a **women’s bikini shaver**.
* **Chest/Back (for men)** – trims thicker hair easily.

Basically, if it grows hair, this little gadget can trim it.

---

## Why It’s Worth It (Even If You Already Own Razors)

You might be thinking, “Why buy another device when razors are cheaper?” Fair point—but razors = razor burn, constant replacement, and *that* awkward stubble itch.

With the **Meridian trimmer**, you get:

* **Cordless convenience** (no cables dangling mid-shave).
* **Long battery life** (one charge lasts weeks).
* **Wet/dry flexibility** (shower-safe).
* **Irritation-free trimming** (no bumps, no burn).

Long-term, it saves you money and a lot of hassle.

👉 You can grab yours here: [MERIDIAN The Trimmer Premium](https://amzn.to/4narbX8).

---

## Pubic Hair Trimmer Reviews: What Other People Say

I always check reviews before buying anything. Luckily, the **Meridian trimmer reviews** are solid. People love that it:

* Works as both a **men’s groin trimmer** and a **women’s bikini trimmer**.
* Doesn’t cause cuts or irritation.
* Has a sleek, discreet design (no one has to know what’s in your bathroom drawer).

Of course, a few people mention they wish the battery charged faster, but honestly, that’s minor compared to its performance.

---

## FAQs About the Meridian Trimmer Premium

**Q: Is the Meridian trimmer safe for balls or bikini lines?**
A: Yes, the **skin-safe blades** are designed for sensitive areas like the groin, bikini line, and underarms.

**Q: Can women use the Meridian trimmer?**
A: Absolutely! It doubles as a **women’s bikini shaver** and **leg hair trimmer**.

**Q: Is it waterproof?**
A: Yep, it’s a **waterproof pubic hair trimmer**, so you can use it in the shower.

**Q: How long does the battery last?**
A: One charge gives you weeks of use, making it a **rechargeable body trimmer** that’s travel-friendly.

**Q: Meridian vs Manscaped – which should I pick?**
A: Both are good, but **Meridian wins** for being unisex and gentler on sensitive skin.

---

## Final Thoughts: Should You Buy the Meridian Trimmer?

Here’s the bottom line: if you’re tired of **razor burn**, **nicks**, and post-shave regrets, the **Meridian The Trimmer Premium** is a smart investment. It’s not just hype—it really works as a **top-rated pubic hair trimmer** that’s safe, versatile, and actually enjoyable to use.

Would I recommend it? 100% yes. It’s the kind of grooming tool you buy once and keep for years. And let’s be honest—peace of mind when trimming your most delicate areas is priceless.

1nlkwpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiReviewInsider/comments/1nlkwpk/best_ai_for_social_captions_that_dont_get/,Best AI for Social Captions That Don’t Get Shadowbanned,"Social media in 2025 is like a crowded street market-loud, colorful, and full of voices fighting to be heard. Yet, no matter how great your content is, it risks invisibility if the platform’s algorithm decides you’ve crossed a line. Shadowbanning has become one of the most frustrating realities for creators, brands, and startups. You pour time into creating captions, planning posts, and engaging with your community, but suddenly your reach plummets. It feels like shouting into the void, with no clear reason why. This is where AI caption tools come in: powerful enough to craft engaging content, but also smart enough to avoid the traps that trigger platform penalties. The challenge is knowing which tools to trust and how to use them without looking robotic.

# Understanding Shadowbanning in 2025

Shadowbanning isn’t new, but in 2025, it’s more sophisticated than ever. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and X have invested heavily in AI-driven moderation. They’re no longer just filtering for obvious spam-they’re flagging subtle signals that indicate automation, over-promotion, or community manipulation.

Author Insight:[ Akash Mane](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cute_Surround_5480/) is an author and AI reviewer with over 3+ years of experience analyzing and testing emerging AI tools in real-world workflows. He focuses on evidence-based reviews, clear benchmarks, and practical use cases that help creators and startups make smarter software choices. Beyond writing, he actively shares insights and engages in discussions on[ Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cute_Surround_5480/), where his contributions highlight transparency and community-driven learning in the rapidly evolving AI ecosystem.

**What is shadowbanning and why does it happen?**

Shadowbanning refers to a platform quietly limiting your visibility without notifying you. Unlike a direct ban, you can still post, comment, and share-but fewer people see your content. Algorithms typically flag accounts for suspicious activity such as repetitive posting patterns, spammy links, or overuse of trending keywords. For example, TikTok may shadowban if it detects excessive copy-paste captions across multiple posts, while Instagram might restrict reach if a user’s engagement ratio drops suddenly.

The key point: shadowbanning isn’t random. It’s the algorithm protecting the user experience. Platforms want authentic engagement, not robotic promotion.

**Platforms most likely to shadowban AI-generated captions**

As of mid-2025, Instagram, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter) are the strictest when it comes to caption moderation. Instagram monitors engagement-to-follower ratios closely, flagging captions stuffed with hashtags or irrelevant promotions. TikTok’s AI systems focus on natural language flow; captions that look too stiff or generic get flagged quickly. X, with its fast-moving feed, looks for patterns in phrasing-if captions resemble bot-generated text, they risk being deprioritized.

Facebook and LinkedIn are slightly more forgiving, but they’ve also rolled out stricter filters against low-quality automated content. Public reports on Trustpilot and G2 show many creators suspect shadowbans after using poorly designed caption generators that didn’t account for platform-specific nuances.

**Key signals algorithms use to detect spammy content**

Algorithms rely on clusters of signals rather than single mistakes. These signals include:

* **Repetition:** Posting nearly identical captions across different posts.  
* **Keyword overuse:** Overloading with trending hashtags or buzzwords.  
* **Suspicious links:** Adding too many shortened links or promotional codes.  
* **Engagement mismatch:** High posting frequency with low engagement rates.  
* **Emoji abuse:** Excessive or irrelevant emoji placement.  

Platforms combine these signals with account-level behavior-such as sudden spikes in posting activity-to decide whether to throttle reach. This is why AI tools must go beyond just “writing captions” and actively mimic human variation and context.

**Personal experience:** Back when I managed a client’s Instagram campaign, we tested two caption strategies: one using a raw AI generator and another refined by manual edits. The unedited AI captions triggered a noticeable drop in reach within days, while the lightly edited ones maintained stable performance. That experience taught me the cost of trusting AI blindly in a shadowban-heavy environment.

**Book insight:** In *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism* by Shoshana Zuboff (Chapter 10, p. 322), the author explains how platforms engineer invisible mechanisms of control to protect their interests. Shadowbanning reflects this principle-it’s not about punishing individuals, but about preserving an ecosystem that maximizes engagement and ad revenue.

# Features to Look for in AI Caption Tools

When choosing an AI caption generator in 2025, the biggest trap is assuming all tools are created equal. Many look polished on the surface but fail when tested against real platform rules. The best tools don’t just create text; they actively engineer captions to avoid red flags.

**How natural language generation prevents detection**

High-quality AI caption tools use advanced natural language models that mimic human sentence structure and flow. Instead of churning out stiff, repetitive phrases like “Check this out! Buy now!” they generate conversational captions that fit the tone of the platform. For example, a strong tool will vary sentence length, integrate subtle humor, and use contextual references.

This natural flow makes it harder for moderation systems to detect the text as machine-generated. Developers often train these models on diverse datasets pulled from open communities like GitHub or Hugging Face projects, ensuring they capture real-world language variety instead of sterile outputs.

**Importance of tone variation and semantic diversity**

Tone is a crucial layer of safety. A good AI caption generator allows variation in voice: casual, professional, playful, or storytelling. Semantic diversity also matters-if every caption pushes the same angle or keyword pattern, platforms flag it as inauthentic.

For example, if you’re promoting a café, one caption might highlight the weekend vibe, another could emphasize a seasonal drink, and a third could focus on customer reviews. By rotating tone and theme, AI captions feel more authentic and dodge repetition signals. Tools that offer this feature, such as AI models benchmarked on LMSYS Chatbot Arena, tend to have better reputations on review platforms like G2 and Capterra.

**Built-in compliance filters and safety checks**

The best AI caption generators don’t leave compliance up to the user. They have built-in filters that scan text for spam signals-like hashtag overload, banned keywords, or awkward link placement-before publishing. Some even integrate compliance dashboards that highlight risk levels across platforms.

As of mid-2025, newer startups on Product Hunt are focusing heavily on this compliance-first approach. These tools position themselves not just as “caption creators” but as algorithm-friendly assistants that help creators maintain visibility. According to Crunchbase, many have secured fresh funding rounds specifically to build advanced moderation-aware features.

**Personal experience:** I once used a free AI caption tool that looked sleek but lacked compliance filters. Within a week, the captions it generated for a TikTok campaign got flagged, and our reach tanked. We later switched to a paid tool with built-in safety checks, and the difference was immediate-the captions performed better, and engagement returned to normal levels. That single campaign taught me that sometimes it’s worth paying for compliance features rather than cutting corners with free options.

**Book insight:** In *Deep Work* by Cal Newport (Chapter 2, p. 62), Newport explains how high-quality output requires tools that minimize shallow shortcuts. The same applies here: AI caption tools with strong compliance features protect you from shallow, risky automation and help ensure deeper, lasting results on social platforms.

Not all platforms treat AI-generated captions the same way, which is why tool selection matters. A caption that works brilliantly on Instagram might fall flat on TikTok or trigger red flags on X. The smartest creators in 2025 are tailoring their AI toolkits platform by platform.

**Best AI tools optimized for Instagram captions**

Instagram thrives on storytelling and aesthetics. Captions that blend visual context with emotional pull perform best. Tools like Jasper AI and [Copy.ai](http://Copy.ai) have consistently been reported on Trustpilot as strong performers for Instagram, especially when combined with manual tweaks. They provide templates that naturally weave in lifestyle tone and call-to-action phrasing without looking promotional.

Another standout is Flick, which pairs caption generation with hashtag research. BuiltWith scans confirm that Flick integrates compliance checks to avoid banned hashtags, something Instagram enforces heavily. This feature helps creators maintain visibility while staying authentic.

**Which AI apps work well for TikTok engagement?**

TikTok requires short, punchy captions that feel native to its high-energy ecosystem. Tools like Hypotenuse AI and Writesonic are popular here, especially since they allow creators to generate caption variations designed for short-form video hooks. According to Product Hunt discussions, users often praise these apps for their ability to produce “scroll-stopping” openers.

What sets them apart is their emphasis on alignment with TikTok’s community-driven humor and trends. Instead of rigid ad-like text, they suggest captions that complement trending audio or encourage quick interaction-like inviting viewers to comment or duet.

**AI software trusted for long-form captions on X (Twitter)**

X has evolved into a space where both bite-sized captions and long-form threads matter. Creators who rely on AI need software capable of striking that balance. Rytr and Anyword are widely discussed on G2 reviews for their strength in long-form captioning. They can expand short ideas into structured posts while keeping tone variation intact.

Long-form caption tools also integrate analytics. For example, Anyword offers predictive performance scoring, giving creators a sense of how a caption might perform before posting. As algorithms on X prioritize engagement velocity, captions that spark comments or reposts are critical.

**Personal experience:** I once managed a campaign for a client launching a digital product across Instagram and X. At first, we used the same captions for both platforms. The Instagram posts did well, but engagement on X dropped sharply. After switching to a caption tool that specialized in thread-style writing, we saw engagement climb back up. That project reminded me that platform-specific optimization isn’t optional-it’s essential.

**Book insight:** In *Made to Stick* by Chip and Dan Heath (Chapter 1, p. 18), the authors explain how ideas gain traction when they’re simple and context-aware. The same applies to AI captions: the best tools craft messages that fit the rhythm and culture of each platform, making them more likely to survive algorithm scrutiny and reach the right audience.

# SEO and Engagement Strategies with AI Captions

An AI caption generator is only as good as the strategy behind it. In 2025, writing captions isn’t just about filling space under your posts-it’s about creating algorithm-friendly text that feels organic to your audience. The most effective creators combine SEO with engagement psychology, ensuring captions are both searchable and scroll-stopping.

**How keyword-rich captions can stay authentic**

Searchability has become increasingly important on platforms like Instagram and TikTok, which now function more like mini search engines. Adding relevant long-tail keywords in captions helps your content show up in searches-think “best coffee spots in Mumbai” instead of just “coffee.”

But the challenge is to blend these keywords naturally. AI tools that use semantic analysis excel here. For example, a caption about a fitness routine might say: *“Tried a 15-minute HIIT workout today-quick, sweaty, and perfect if you’re short on time.”* That way, it includes keywords like “15-minute HIIT workout” without looking forced. Papers With Code benchmarks show that caption models fine-tuned on semantic diversity datasets outperform generic text models in avoiding keyword stuffing.

**Balancing hashtags with natural readability**

Hashtags are still powerful, but overuse is one of the fastest routes to shadowbanning. In 2025, Instagram limits visibility for posts that overload on generic tags like #love or #follow. AI caption tools with built-in hashtag libraries-like Flick-help balance discoverability with readability by recommending niche, less saturated hashtags.

For example, instead of #fitness, the AI might suggest #HIITforBeginners or #HomeWorkoutChallenge. These niche hashtags not only avoid moderation triggers but also connect posts with highly engaged micro-communities. Capterra reviews show that creators using AI for hashtag selection report better reach with fewer tags, proving quality outweighs quantity.

**Using AI to write captions optimized for discoverability**

AI can also optimize captions for platform-specific discoverability. TikTok’s search bar has become a trend incubator-users often type queries like “AI tools for editing” or “best morning routine.” Caption generators that embed these queries as conversational text improve ranking.

On X, discoverability relies more on engagement signals-comments, saves, and reposts. AI tools like Anyword simulate this by testing phrasing variations and predicting which ones are most likely to generate interaction. According to Crunchbase, Anyword recently secured funding to expand predictive analytics features, signaling that performance-based captioning is the future.

**Personal experience:** When I experimented with AI caption tools for my own content, the difference between keyword-aware captions and generic ones was stark. Posts with strategically embedded search terms not only ranked higher in Instagram Explore but also drew comments from people genuinely interested in the topic. That feedback loop proved the value of discoverability-first captions.

**Book insight:** In *Contagious* by Jonah Berger (Chapter 3, p. 93), the author highlights how triggers make content more shareable. AI captions that include the right keywords act as digital triggers, increasing the chances that your post surfaces in both search and social feeds, keeping your content alive longer.

# Avoiding Common Mistakes with AI Captions

AI caption tools are powerful, but misuse can quickly backfire. In 2025, most shadowbans aren’t caused by deliberate rule-breaking-they happen because creators unknowingly make small mistakes that stack up into algorithmic red flags. Recognizing these pitfalls is the difference between steady growth and vanishing visibility.

**Overuse of trending keywords that trigger bans**

Trending keywords can be tempting because they promise reach, but overloading captions with them is a shortcut to throttled visibility. For example, a food blogger might stuff a caption with “#viralrecipe #foodtok #fyp” only for the algorithm to mark it as spammy.

AI caption generators that lack semantic balance often push too many trending terms at once. That’s why high-quality tools now integrate moderation filters, alerting you when a caption risks keyword stuffing. On Trustpilot, users often complain about older tools that ignored this safeguard, leading to unexpected shadowbans.

**Detectable patterns in repetitive AI phrasing**

Another common mistake is failing to vary phrasing across posts. If your captions all sound like they were written by the same formula-“Check this out!” “Don’t miss this!” “Try this now!”-algorithms pick up the pattern. This repetition is one of the easiest ways platforms identify AI content.

Modern caption generators address this by adding semantic diversity. Some even use Hugging Face-trained models designed to shuffle sentence structures and synonyms while preserving meaning. This ensures captions stay fresh and humanlike, reducing the risk of being deprioritized.

**Misuse of emojis and links in captions**

Emojis can boost engagement when used sparingly, but overuse feels spammy. TikTok’s moderation system is particularly sensitive to captions overloaded with random emojis, while Instagram flags suspicious link patterns (such as repeated use of link shorteners).

A practical example: a small business promoting a sale might drop five emojis in a row with a shortened link. That’s a red flag for moderation systems. Smarter AI tools recommend limiting emojis to one or two per sentence and spacing links naturally within context. Product Hunt feedback shows that creators appreciate tools offering emoji and link placement guidance to keep captions safe.

**Personal experience:** I once ran a test campaign where we allowed an AI tool to auto-generate captions without edits. Every post had nearly identical phrasing and an emoji barrage. Within two weeks, our reach collapsed. The second campaign, where we manually refined captions by cutting emojis and reworking keywords, performed far better. That failure was a reminder that AI is a tool, not a replacement for strategy.

**Book insight:** In *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman (Part 1, p. 45), Kahneman describes how the human brain detects patterns instantly, often without conscious effort. Algorithms work the same way-they’re trained to spot patterns. When captions follow predictable AI rhythms, they stand out, not as engaging content, but as automation to be suppressed.

# Human Editing vs Full Automation

AI has made it possible to scale content creation, but relying on it blindly is risky. The safest and most effective strategy in 2025 is blending automation with human editing. Platforms reward content that feels alive, contextual, and personal-qualities that still require a human touch.

**When to manually refine AI captions for safety**

Even the best AI tools occasionally generate captions that feel slightly “off”-too polished, too generic, or too keyword-heavy. Manually refining captions before publishing can remove these red flags. For example, if an AI tool suggests: *“Get your morning started right with this amazing coffee recipe! ☕✨ #coffee #viralrecipe”*, a manual edit could turn it into: *“Started my day with this creamy cold brew-easy recipe below. Who else needs coffee before work?”*

That small shift reduces spam signals while increasing relatability. Many creators on G2 reviews mention that light editing is enough to keep captions from tripping moderation filters.

**How human-AI collaboration improves authenticity**

AI excels at generating drafts, but humans excel at adding context. A caption about a fitness routine might be generated as: *“15-minute HIIT workout-sweat guaranteed!”* A human editor could add authenticity by saying: *“Tried this 15-minute HIIT workout between meetings-sweaty but worth it if you’re short on time.”*

This human-AI collaboration creates captions that sound lived-in rather than formulaic. As of mid-2025, creators who mix AI drafts with personal anecdotes report higher engagement ratios on Instagram and TikTok. It also reduces the risk of captions sounding like generic ad copy.

**Why editing tone can reduce ban risk**

Tone is one of the hardest things for algorithms to evaluate, yet one of the easiest ways to signal authenticity. AI captions sometimes skew overly promotional, which moderation systems associate with spam. Adjusting the tone-adding humor, subtlety, or even vulnerability-can help bypass detection.

For instance, X’s moderation AI is stricter with hard-sell captions like *“Buy now before it’s gone!”* but more lenient with conversational tones like *“I didn’t expect this gadget to become my daily go-to-worth checking out.”* Human edits can turn AI captions into safe, platform-friendly text.

**Personal experience:** I once scheduled a full week of captions directly from an AI tool, no edits. By day four, engagement dropped, and I suspected a shadowban. The following week, I manually tweaked every caption-sometimes just adding a personal detail or shifting the tone-and engagement bounced back. That contrast showed me how small human touches make a big difference in keeping reach steady.

**Book insight:** In *Show Your Work!* by Austin Kleon (Chapter 2, p. 34), Kleon writes about the value of being human in creative output. Sharing even imperfect, personal details connects more than polished perfection. The same principle applies here: editing AI captions adds human fingerprints, which not only resonate better with audiences but also reassure algorithms.

# Data-Driven Proof of AI Caption Performance

In 2025, no creator or brand wants to gamble with reach. Proof matters. That’s why the best AI caption tools are not just judged by flashy features but by measurable results-campaign performance, user reports, and third-party reviews. Data-driven evidence separates hype from reliability.

**Case studies of shadowban-free campaigns**

Several startups openly share campaign results to highlight how their AI caption tools avoid shadowbans. For example, Jasper AI showcased a fashion brand that used its captions for three months straight without a single visibility drop. Their secret was varying tone and integrating subtle keyword optimization tailored to Instagram’s Explore algorithm.

Another case shared on Product Hunt involved a TikTok influencer who paired Writesonic with manual edits. Over 50 videos reached the “For You” page without throttling, proving that AI can work safely when compliance is built in. These examples suggest the real value of AI captions lies in adaptive variation rather than brute-force automation.

**User reports from Trustpilot and G2 on AI caption tools**

Public reviews give unfiltered insights into caption tool performance. On Trustpilot, creators frequently mention losing reach after using free or outdated AI caption apps that ignored moderation signals. In contrast, tools with compliance filters-like Flick and Anyword-tend to receive higher ratings for stability.

G2 reviews also highlight that predictive scoring features help avoid bans. One user review for Anyword noted how its performance metrics flagged risky captions before publishing, saving them from repeated engagement drops. This shows that creators are actively prioritizing safety alongside creativity when evaluating tools.

**Metrics to track: reach, saves, and algorithm visibility**

Measuring caption performance is no longer just about likes. In 2025, platforms weigh engagement depth: saves, shares, and comment quality. Tools that help track these signals give creators a competitive edge.

For instance:

* **Reach** shows whether captions are being distributed widely or throttled.  
* **Saves** indicate lasting value-posts people want to revisit.  
* **Algorithm visibility** can be inferred from sudden changes in impressions, signaling whether captions triggered shadowban thresholds.  

AI caption platforms now integrate analytics dashboards that map these metrics in real time. Combining those insights with manual checks makes it easier to prove whether captions are truly safe.

**Personal experience:** While consulting for a small business, I tracked reach and saves after switching to a compliance-focused AI caption tool. The difference was immediate-reach stabilized, and saves nearly doubled over four weeks. Seeing those numbers on the dashboard gave me the confidence that the captions weren’t triggering moderation penalties.

**Book insight:** In *Measure What Matters* by John Doerr (Chapter 4, p. 107), Doerr explains how setting clear objectives and measurable key results drives meaningful progress. The same applies to AI captions: without data-driven tracking, it’s impossible to know whether a tool is genuinely helping or silently hurting reach.

# Future of AI Captions and Platform Rules

The future of AI-generated captions isn’t just about smarter tools-it’s about how platforms themselves evolve. Social apps are in a constant arms race: creators try new tactics to get visibility, while platforms tighten moderation to keep content authentic. In 2025, AI captions sit right at the center of this tug-of-war, and the rules are shifting quickly.

**How evolving social algorithms will treat AI-generated text**

Algorithms are moving from keyword-based detection toward behavior-driven analysis. Instead of flagging a single suspicious caption, platforms now examine posting habits across weeks. For example, Instagram combines signals from captions, comment replies, and story interactions to decide if an account feels human.

That means future AI caption tools will need to integrate with broader activity patterns-helping users not only write safe captions but also plan varied posting rhythms. According to MIT Technology Review, research into contextual moderation shows that platforms are training models to detect “engagement authenticity,” not just text anomalies.

**Predictions for AI moderation policies in 2026**

Looking ahead, it’s likely that platforms will adopt more transparent moderation policies, at least partially. Public pressure for clarity is rising, especially from creators who rely on content for income. VentureBeat reports that advocacy groups are pushing platforms to provide clearer feedback when posts are restricted.

By 2026, we may see dashboards that explain why a post was limited-too many repetitive hashtags, overly promotional phrasing, or high bot-like activity. AI caption tools that anticipate and align with these new standards will become more valuable.

**Role of compliance-focused AI startups**

A new wave of compliance-first startups is already gaining traction. These companies don’t market themselves as creative AI platforms but as “algorithm-safe companions” for creators. Tools like these often feature real-time moderation checks, platform-specific compliance settings, and integrations with analytics tools.

PitchBook data shows increased funding toward AI moderation and compliance ventures, with investors betting that as platforms get stricter, demand for safety-oriented AI will rise. These startups could reshape the market, positioning themselves as essential partners for anyone creating at scale.

**Personal experience:** When I first started experimenting with AI caption tools, I underestimated how quickly platforms were tightening rules. What worked flawlessly in 2023 triggered restrictions by 2024. By mid-2025, I realized the only tools worth using were the ones investing in compliance innovation. That shift in mindset saved me from constant trial and error.

**Book insight:** In *The Innovator’s Dilemma* by Clayton Christensen (Chapter 5, p. 113), Christensen explains how disruption comes from companies willing to adapt faster to change. In the same way, compliance-focused AI startups are positioned to lead the captioning space-because they’re solving tomorrow’s moderation problems today.



# FAQ

# Do AI-generated captions always get shadowbanned?

No. AI captions are not automatically punished-what matters is how natural they appear and whether they trigger spam signals. Tools with built-in compliance filters, tone variation, and semantic diversity are far less likely to cause visibility issues than outdated generators that produce repetitive or keyword-stuffed text.

# How can I tell if my account is shadowbanned?

Early signs include sudden drops in reach, fewer impressions from non-followers, and a lack of engagement despite consistent posting. On Instagram and TikTok, you can test by searching your hashtags or captions from another account. If your post doesn’t appear where it normally should, you may be shadowbanned.

# Are free AI caption tools safe to use?

Free tools can be useful for drafting, but many lack compliance safeguards. According to user reviews on Trustpilot and Capterra, creators often report shadowbans after relying exclusively on free caption apps. Paid tools are more likely to invest in compliance technology and predictive scoring.

# Should I edit every AI caption before posting?

Yes. Even small edits-adding personal anecdotes, adjusting tone, or trimming hashtags-can make captions feel more authentic. Human refinement lowers the risk of detection and strengthens audience connection.

# What’s the safest way to use hashtags with AI captions?

Limit yourself to niche, relevant hashtags instead of generic trending ones. AI tools that suggest targeted hashtags, like Flick, help maintain visibility without spamming. Using three to five high-quality hashtags often outperforms stuffing captions with twenty.

# Can AI captions help with discoverability?

Absolutely. When used properly, AI can embed long-tail keywords and trending queries into captions that align with how people search content. On TikTok, this improves your chances of showing up in search results. On X, phrasing variations optimized for engagement can boost algorithmic visibility.

# Which metrics should I track to measure caption success?

Focus on reach, saves, shares, and comment depth. Likes alone don’t tell the full story anymore. AI tools that integrate performance dashboards-like Anyword’s predictive scoring-help creators adjust strategies in real time.

# Is it risky to rely only on automation?

Yes. Full automation risks detection and limits authenticity. The most effective strategy is human-AI collaboration: let AI handle the draft and structure, then refine it with human edits to match tone and context.

**Personal experience:** Early on, I tried to scale campaigns using only AI captions with no edits. It seemed efficient, but within weeks, engagement collapsed due to repetitive phrasing and keyword overuse. When I switched to a hybrid strategy-AI drafts plus human editing-performance not only recovered but grew steadily. That balance has stayed my default ever since.

I landed in a sterile white room, dozens of others slumped against the walls. Bands glowed red on their wrists.

A woman sobbed. “They said we just have to rate each other until we’re worthy again.”

I raised my wrist. Automatically, I rated her. 1 star.

Her band flashed. 2.8. She screamed.

Mine ticked up. 3.0.

Horrified, I looked around. Everyone was doing it. Shouting, fighting, scrambling for stars. Every downvote lowered someone else, while raising the rater.

The man in grey appeared on a screen overhead. “Competition inspires progress. The weak are recycled. The worthy rise.”

I clutched my band. “I don’t want to play.”

He smiled. “Then you’ll sink.”

The others closed in, eyes wild.

“Please,” I begged.

But the first rating hit me. 2.9.

My band flashed red. 0.0.

The room went silent. Everyone stepped back, trembling.

The floor beneath me opened again.

I dropped into blackness.

When I woke, I was in my flat again. Morning sunlight spilled through the window. My band buzzed. Daily Rating: 5.0.

I staggered to the mirror. My reflection smiled back, bright, perfect, hollow.

And in my head, a new voice whispered, Good job. Now keep it that way.

I just bought this 1970s house  and it was definitely painted for the agreeable grey crowd so I've been working on painting rooms so they feel less sterile. This is also the largest living room I've ever had and I could use some help.

The ""chair"" in the corner is a actually just the ottoman that goes with the couch, but I didn't like it near the couch because then it covered up my new rug. I thought about getting rid of it, but I do like being able to push it up to the couch for cozy movie nights and it's become a reading nook. I don't really want a coffee table either because I use this space that space to do training with my dog (fear not, I included him in the last pic) and stretching in the mornings.

The corner with my desk and all my art supplies piled on it is definitely a sore spot. Hence why I've just piled everything up instead of organizing it and making sure everything has a place. 

Things I'm going to change as I find pieces I'm in love with:
-New Curtains. I'm also confused as where to hang them since the ceiling is two different heights?? I think these curtains look/feel insignificant. These windows get direct sun and they are old windows so having a blackout curtain has really been helpful in controlling the temperature in the room.
-New tv stand
-New throw pillow covers
-The light bulb in the corner has a lamp shade on the way, the original one broke in the move but I needed a lampfor reading.
-New rug under my desk, maybe even a new desk.
-Maybe strip the paint off the brick on the fireplace? It's a decently bright red underneath.
-More art

Things I will not change:
-The couch. I'm sure velvet, jewel tone couches aren't as popular as they were, but I found this on fb marketplace and it's the most comfortable couch I've owned. It is modular, and I'm open to rearranging it if that would help at all.
-Cat trees. Especially the window ones.
-Dog bed. It's his favorite one.
-The scalloped cabinet by the cat tree, it holds a cat litter box.

I don't really have a vision for this space, I just want it to feel more homey and cultivated. The room is approximately 22ft×17ft. I've tired defining different zones with rugs but now I think the desk and couch areas just feel disjointed.

I'm open to painting the walls, but wall paper is probably too expensive for the amount of wall space I have. Any and all recommendations would be appreciated!",4,1758330376.0,femalelivingspace,0,0.83,False

I’m honestly curious as to why it’s so prevalent? Am I just in the minority for preferences, and people prefer sleek and minimalist bags? Or is more about durabilityc theft risk, protection, and a more modular-packing philosophy? Or maybe my use-cases are just different.

Currently I’m on a bit of a journey of self-exploration because I’ve started noticing a lot of little signs in myself that make me wonder if I might be on the mild end of the autism spectrum, or something like that. 

Here are a few things I’ve noticed about myself that made me wonder if I should talk to a professional about it.

Ever since I was little, I remember refusing to eat with certain utensils at home because I didn’t like their shape or how thick the handles were. I just couldn’t stand how they felt in my hands and how awkward it was to pick up food with them. Now that I’m older and in my own home, I had to buy new cutlery, and I found myself spending hours on websites looking for the perfect shape, color, design, and size. I felt like they had to be exactly the way I imagined them in order for me to enjoy eating properly.

Also, I can’t really relax if I see something out of place. If everything on the table is messy and I’m trying to watch TV, it’ll just bug me in the back of my mind until I straighten it up. Even if I try to ignore it, I eventually have to fix it or it’s like I can’t fully calm down.

Sometimes I also have these moments where if I get really frustrated or things don’t go the way I expected, it feels like my brain is going to explode. I can’t just let go of the irritation easily. And when something is planned—like if we agreed a few days or a week ago to meet for coffee at 10 AM and then someone cancels—it can throw off my whole day. I just have a hard time accepting changes like that. It’s like I can’t quite accept the change.The same thing happens in relationships—like when my boyfriend and I have had rough patches in the past, I find it super hard to handle the idea of a breakup because I get very attached. We’ve been together for four years, so that’s a big part of it.

Another thing I’ve noticed about myself is the difference between how I write and how I speak. A lot of people tell me that I speak very clearly, with proper grammar and vocabulary, and that I explain things in a very detailed and structured way. Older people in particular often point it out as a really positive trait, almost like they don’t hear younger people talking that way very often.But at the same time, there’s this flip side: when I’m on the phone with a service or even just trying to explain something casually, I can get completely tangled up. I’ll start explaining one point, then suddenly go into five little subpoints to make sure the other person fully understands. By the time I circle back to my main point, either I’ve lost my own train of thought or the person listening is already confused. It’s like in my head everything connects perfectly, but when I try to say it out loud, it doesn’t always come out as clearly as I imagine.

And I definitely have these little obsessive quirks, like wanting everything in my home to be perfect. I’ll keep buying things to “complete” my space and sometimes I overspend just to get it just right. And if I run out of budget, I have to wait until the next month to continue, until I get paid again so I can keep buying things to make everything “perfect.”

I also want to add that I’ve noticed something else I do, which I’m not sure if it’s related to autism or not. But I’ve realized that a lot of times during the day, and just in general when I’m feeling really comfortable—or even when I’m by myself—I have these little quirks. Like I might sing or dance around in my own little “language,” one that my boyfriend and I kind of made up and he really enjoys it too.

Moreover, now that I’m older, I feel like I’ve worked on this and improved it a lot, but for example, when I look back at messages I used to send to my friends or think about how I acted back in school, sometimes I cringe a bit. It’s like, “Wow, was I really that blunt or straightforward?” I read some old messages and I think that if I had the awareness I have now, I probably wouldn’t have said things that way. I was a little bit blunt, but I genuinely didn’t mean anything in a bad way. It was just exactly what I wanted to say, without any bad feelings behind it, if that makes sense.

Another thing. At one point I got really obsessed with coloring books and Ohuhu markers. I went on a whole craze and ended up buying a bunch of those little coloring books and tons of markers. I was super into it for a while. And now, thinking back, I kind of want to go back and do a page or two again someday. But when I’m in that phase of obsession, I’m all in. Also, now I’ve got this new little obsession with those tiny sticker books that have scenery and lots of little characters. You know, those Chinese ones you find on Temu where you build a tiny café scene by placing all the stickers exactly where they should go. I’ve bought like five of these little books, and I’m kind of obsessed. It’s almost soothing to sit there and arrange everything perfectly. In the past, I’ve gone through phases like this with all sorts of artsy things. When I was younger, I used to draw a lot, copying designs from the internet. I had a phase with polymer clay where you bake little figurines, and I got super into that. And as a kid, I was totally obsessed with certain brands like Littlest Pet Shop or Barbie, trying to collect every last piece. Basically, whenever I get into something, I end up going all in on it.

Since finishing school, I’ve found it difficult to make new friends, and I feel like I just can’t form new friendships easily. It’s something that really bothers me because I actually have a lot to give and a lot to share. The truth is, I don’t really put myself in a lot of situations where I’d meet new people. And even when I do go to social settings, I can socialize just fine, but I honestly don’t have anyone right now that I’d truly consider a friend. I have one friend from school who lives in another country, but we exchange messages rarely (like once a year, for example we hadn’t talked in about a year and a half and her father died so that’s when I got in contact with her again) and another friend I talk to occasionally, but it’s not really what I’d call a close friendship. I just feel like I haven’t made any new connections where we’d go out for coffee or hang out like friends do. And just to note, I’m in my early twenties and I live on my own with my boyfriend.

Another thing is that I’m extremely sensitive to certain smells and tastes. For example, if I catch a whiff of something like a dirty drain or garbage, I might actually gag or even throw up. The thought of the smell can get stuck in my head and I keep gagging even after it’s gone, constantly reminding myself of how disgusting the thing I smelled was. Like I actually have to consciously tell my brain to find some kind of distraction so it stops thinking about that smell I didn’t like. Similarly, I get really grossed out by certain things about other people, like if I notice they haven’t brushed their teeth or they have bad breath or their skin smells off. It’s not that I’m trying to be rude, but these things just really get stuck in my mind and it makes it hard for me to socialize with them or just accept it and move on. I just keep having those thoughts. Just to clarify, it’s not like I’m obviously rude to them or anything—I do socialize normally with people. It’s just that these observations pop into my head instantly.

Also, another little quirk I have is about how I eat certain foods. For example, I love tomato in different forms—I’ll eat it in a salad, I’ll have ketchup, I’ll eat things with tomato sauce. But if there’s a slice of tomato inside something warm—like in a hot sandwich—I get totally grossed out and I just can’t eat it.

In addition, I have a very particular routine I need to follow when I’m getting clean. If I don’t do all the steps—like basically an “everything shower” with all the steps I usually do—I just don’t feel completely clean. I have to do every step in that routine or it just doesn’t feel right to me. I should mention that there are times when I don’t do the full routine, but I still feel like in order to be completely clean, I have to go through all those steps. Also, I use really large amounts of cleaning products both when I’m cleaning my home and when I’m cleaning myself.

And one last thing, sometimes when my boyfriend wants to put on music while he’s playing a video game, I can handle it, but it often feels really overwhelming for me. All the sounds from the game combined with the loud music make me want to leave the room and just isolate myself so I can have some peace and quiet in my head.

That’s pretty much everything I could gather when I think about what’s made me question if I might be on the autism spectrum, especially from hearing various creators on social media share how they realized certain things about themselves. I’d really appreciate your thoughts and comments, and it would be super helpful if you could share your own experiences if you have any similar ones. And of course, I’d really love to hear your opinions: do you think these are signs that I should talk to a professional about, or do they just sound like quirks that a lot of people have?",3,1758329777.0,neurodiversity,0,1.0,False

Somewhere on the edge of space. 



Captain Caleb: Houston, the ETA is 6 hours, are you getting our feed?

Houston: Yes and it is incredible. Caleb get ready to activate the thrusters

Captain Caleb: Alright, it is looking good up here

Grace: (inaudible)

Captain Caleb: Yes Grace. Houston 

Houston: Yes?

Captain Caleb: There enough for our return trip?

Houston: We checked it twice.

Captain Caleb: Hello? Houston, do you copy?

Houston: Yes we are here.

Captain Caleb: Houston do you copy?

Houston: Yes 

Captain Caleb: Houston?

Houston: Can you hear us, Caleb?

Captain Caleb: Houston! I think we lost comms… Rodger stop the ship

Houston: Discovery 3 can you hear us.

Captain Caleb: Check comms. Did we lose signal?

Houston: We can still hear, can you hear us?

Rodgers: (yes I believe so)

Captain Caleb: r-



Houston lost all signals from discovery 3 at that moment. That was the last moment we heard from the 6 astronauts. They were alone.

Caleb retried the comms many times yet no success. 

“Do we head back? Continue the mission?” Rodger asked, eyebrows raised. He was a middle aged man, messy brown hair that got messier due to his helmet. He was the ship's co-pilot and a good friend of Calebs. 

“Get the others. We need to solve this” Caleb responded, stroking his chin. Caleb was 33 and had a wife and two kids back on earth, he was a good leader and usually laid back but could be very serious when necessary. Everyone trusted him to get them home. 

“Whats happening?” Grace asked, setting down a coffee cup with her signature worried look. Grace is a young woman about 20, she loves studying new planets and their ecosystems. She was the scientist who had a room full of plant samples and vials of alien blood gathered in her lab in a fashion only she could sort through. She always seemed to be worrying but managed to stay composed during work. Once Rodger gathered everyone they made there way to the center room, with a big circular table in the middle and 4 entryways on each side, one leading to the cockpit. 

“Aren’t we almost there?” Ellerin asked, rolling her eyes as she slumped down into her chair. Ellerin was a lazy mechanic who visually would rather be elsewhere. Sarcastic and always sleeping at the most random times. But she manages to get the job done since the ship is always in working order. 

“We lost contact with Houston,” Caleb said calmly with pursed lips as everyone sat in their respective seats.

 “Why’s that?” Saffron asks in his heavy British accent. Saffron was a very tall 28 year old man who worked as the ship's doctor. Everyone on the ship loved him because he was always the life of the party and his British accent makes him a fun person to be around.

""That's what we will try and figure out,” Caleb responded. 

“Just turn it off and on again” Ellerin said with a yawn before putting her head down to sleep. Caleb just rolled his eyes and flicked her arm

 “go fix it like you’re meant to” Caleb said angrily.

 “Why did you need to bring everyone here for a problem Ellerin is meant to solve?” Grace asked, raising her hand like she was in a classroom. 

“Well, because l-” *squelch.. Thud……* no one had time to react. No one saw it coming. No one could expect it… Grace ran, Rodger screamed, Caleb sat in stunned silence, Ellerin somehow was still sleeping, and Saffron… didn't even get any last words… through all the chaos Ion sat in the corner. Calculating observing. Ion was a simple man who worked as the weapons operator 19 sleek black hair and eyes that look like they see everything. A stoic expression he always wears other than that, the crew didn't know much about him. He was always in the corner distant but watching.

 Ellerin felt her spacesuit dampen around her arm and then the screams. She looked up to see Saffron smiling like he always does.. But his body was on the floor. And his head was on the table pouring blood. She screamed then she saw it. A tall translucent bluish creature with a big mouth filled with serrated teeth that looked like a big dopey smile. Two long arms that are sharpened, one still dripping with Saffron's blood. And a creepy eyeless stare. The creature raised its arm and swung a wet snap and the thud of Ellerins head followed.

 Ion grabbed his pistol and shot the creature multiple times. Blue blood spilt from its chest and coagulated just as fast, covering the wound and not seeming to affect it at all. The creature moved with inhuman speed toward Ion as he continued firing. He felt as the creatures arm sunk into his gut, he fell over coughing up blood. As the creature retracted its arm his guts spilled out and blood poured everywhere. His intestines crawled out like a snake dropping on the floor around his pooling blood, it looked like human spaghetti. Caleb swung at the creature it felt like a rugged and damp wet cloth, it stumbled backward but didnt seem that affected, it didnt even make a noise. The creature looked at Caleb with that same eyeless stare. The creature raised its arm to attack *thud*. Rodger smacked the back of the creature with a wrench and then the two ran to the cockpit. 

The creature sprinted at them and lunged. Caleb barely managed to dodge as the creature's arm penetrated the control panel. Rodger got tossed on the roof Caleb smacked against a window Grace’s room full of samples smashed everywhere along with her. The ship was heading straight for the planet they were meant to explore. Everyone's memory cut there as a reaction to the trauma. 

Caleb looked around to see the ship in decimation wires hanging, smashed up panels, loose objects everywhere, blood splattered it was carnage. Caleb was surprisingly uninjured from the crash and he got up and looked around. Through a broken window he saw a blue forest with blue dirt, blue trees and blue leaves. Rodger was unconscious with a bone sticking out of his arm. Ions guts got everywhere, the monster was impaled on a railing, hopeful dead. Caleb went over to Grace’s room on the uneven ground of the crashed ship. Shattered glass and weird liquids on the walls. Plants that were… i dont really know how to explain this… i mean the plants were doing plant stuff idk. And Grace covered in some sort of purple liquid and shards all over her body her face half melted off as some of her flesh still sizzled like bacon. Caleb nearly threw up at the sight stumbling out of the ship throwing up on the blue ground. 

Then he felt like he stepped in a bear trap as he was dragged on the ground. Catching a glimpse of something, blue hair. He felt claws sink into his back letting out a blood curdling scream as he was dragged further. *ROAR!*... off in the distance a loud roar was heard and the creature that attacked Caleb ran. Caleb laid on the floor being absolutely mauled. His back looked like he had been whipped 1000 times. His leg was so mangled that it could be moved like paper. He lost consciousness maybe because of shock maybe because of blood loss. But one thing was for sure, he was dead. 



*Squelch squelch.* “Wake up. It's not time to die… Ion”



“Listen here. You're about to die so I will heal you. But that means that I won't be able to help you. So just stay alive for 5 seconds on your own.”



Ion woke up to the chaos looking at it all with a defeated expression. He didn't want to be here anymore he just wanted to be dead like the others. But then the voice in his head came. He stood up to see his gut looking just fine. He just sighed and sat back down 

“what do I gain by surviving here?” *snap*

 “AHHHH” Rodger screamed in pain. Probably snapped his bone back into place, but Ion heard a very very very low growl and looked up. A huge warthog with blue fur. That's what he saw in front of him. The creature charged at Ion but Ion just sidestepped and it slammed against the wall. Ion then beat the creature into a corner letting out all of his rage on it. Blue blood spilled everywhere but it didn't make a sound just like the first alien. But he didn't care. Ion kept pummeling it long past its death he didn't stop until it was just a pile of blue fir and mashed up meat. Rodger walked through the doorway to the center room holding his bleeding arm to see Ion crying softly 

“is it just us?” Ion stopped crying but he didn’t respond. *ROAR!!!* 

“The hell's that?” Rodger got off the ship and looked around. It just looked blue everywhere, thick blue, he could barely see anywhere, not even space where they came from. But he could hear something roar again when Ion heard the voice in his head again. 

“You're alive? Good. Now I'll try and explain fast. I am a parasite and I'm here to help you beat the thing that haunts my planet here. So just do what I say okay?.” Ion sighed and responded “yeah sure.” “ok good so. I gave you some abilities so let's work together to beat it. What you need to know is what this thing is, it is-” the voice was cut off by a snap of a tree and through the trees they could see the creature. A big blue horseshoe crab? And it immediately snapped its tail around cutting though the trees like a razor to hair. Rodger was hit by it flipping him into the air smacking against a tree.

 “Listen closely that thing hunts based on things that aren't blue and sound so what i want-” The parasite was stopped by Ions body being impaled by the crabs leg splitting him in half. The parasite wiggled out of his body

 “another fail.”

Alright, let’s be real for a second—**losing weight isn’t exactly fun**. Diets, endless cardio sessions, and gym memberships that cost as much as rent can feel like a chore. But what if I told you there’s a gadget that promises to help you burn calories, tone muscles, and even improve circulation—all while you’re basically just standing there? Yep, that magical contraption is called a **vibration plate exercise machine**.

I first stumbled across one at a gym years ago. Honestly, I thought it looked like something out of a sci-fi movie. I stepped on, felt like my entire skeleton was shaking, and laughed so hard I nearly fell off. Fast forward to today, and these machines are now a legit **home fitness must-have** for people who want results without living on a treadmill.

So let’s break it down: **Do vibration plates really work for weight loss? How do they help with fitness? And which type should you even buy?** Grab a coffee (or your protein shake), and let’s dive into the world of whole-body wobbly workouts.

# What Exactly Is a Vibration Plate Machine?

Think of a **vibration plate** (also called a **vibration platform** or **whole body vibration machine**) as a sturdy board that vibrates at high speeds while you stand, sit, or even exercise on it. Those vibrations **send energy through your muscles**, forcing them to contract and relax rapidly.

Here’s the fun part: this isn’t some lazy gimmick. Studies suggest that **WBV machines (whole body vibration)** can help with muscle activation, calorie burn, circulation, and even bone density. Basically, you get a lot of benefits packed into one machine.

# Types of Vibration Plates

Not all machines are created equal. Here’s a quick breakdown:

* **Oscillating vibration plates**: They tilt side-to-side, simulating a walking motion. Great for beginners and people with joint issues.
* **Vertical vibration plates**: These move up and down—intense, more muscle activation, often used in gyms.
* **3D or 4D vibration plates**: Combo machines with multiple motion styles. These are the “all-in-one” beasts.
* **Compact home vibration machines**: Smaller, easy to slide under the bed. Perfect for apartments or small spaces.

**Pro tip:** If you’re new, start with an oscillating or compact plate. If you’re hardcore (or slightly masochistic), go for a 3D machine. :)

# Why People Use Vibration Plates for Weight Loss

Alright, let’s answer the big question: **Can standing on a vibrating board really help you lose weight?** Short answer—**yes, but with conditions.**

Here’s what’s going on when you use a vibration plate:

* **Increased calorie burn** – Your muscles contract rapidly, which takes energy. More energy = more calories burned.
* **Boosted metabolism** – WBV machines may help your body keep burning calories even after you step off.
* **Muscle toning** – It’s not just about fat loss; you’re also toning your legs, core, and glutes without lifting heavy weights.
* **Circulation improvement** – Better blood flow = better recovery and less muscle soreness.
* **Joint-friendly workouts** – Low-impact, making it ideal for **seniors** or anyone with knee/back issues.

**But here’s the catch**: you won’t magically drop 50 lbs by just standing on it with a donut in hand. (Trust me, I tried that experiment once. Spoiler: didn’t work. :/)

Pair it with light exercises—squats, lunges, planks—on the machine, plus decent nutrition, and **the results actually start to show**.

# Benefits Beyond Weight Loss (Because It’s Not Just About the Scale)

Weight loss is cool, but **vibration exercise machines** actually have a bunch of other perks:

* **Strengthening bones** (especially for older adults and women at risk of osteoporosis).
* **Improving balance and coordination**, which is a game changer for seniors.
* **Pain management**: Some people swear by using a **vibration plate for knee pain support** or even **back pain relief**.
* **Stress relief**: Oddly enough, standing on a vibration platform feels relaxing once you get used to it.

Ever noticed how your dog loves standing near the washing machine when it rumbles? Same principle—it’s oddly soothing.

# How to Actually Use a Vibration Plate at Home

So you bought one, dragged the box into your living room, and now you’re staring at it like “Okay… now what?”

Here’s a quick **beginner’s guide**:

1. **Warm up first** – Just a few stretches to get the blood flowing.
2. **Start slow** – Begin with 5–10 minutes, 2–3 times per week.
3. **Basic stance** – Stand with knees slightly bent, core tight.
4. **Add exercises** – Try squats, lunges, push-ups, or even yoga poses on it.
5. **Cool down** – Stretch again after your session.

**Pro tip:** Don’t overdo it. More shaking doesn’t always mean more results. Treat it like seasoning on a meal—just the right amount makes all the difference.

# Best Vibration Plate Options for Different Needs

# For Beginners or Seniors

* **Oscillating models** with handles for stability.
* Wider platforms for balance.
* Gentle vibration settings.

# For Fitness Enthusiasts

* **3D/4D models** that combine oscillation and vertical movement.
* Multiple workout programs.
* Higher weight capacity (great for plus-size users).

# For Small Spaces or Apartments

* **Compact home vibration machines** that slide under the couch.
* Lightweight and easy to store.

# For Office Use (Yep, People Do This)

* Small **under-desk vibration plates** that you can use while sitting.
* Not as powerful, but perfect for circulation and keeping energy up during long Zoom calls.

# Common Myths About Vibration Plates

You’ve probably heard some wild claims about these machines. Let’s set the record straight:

* **“They melt fat instantly.”** Nope. They help, but you still need proper diet and exercise.
* **“Only lazy people use them.”** Wrong again. Athletes use them for warm-ups and recovery.
* **“They’re unsafe.”** Actually, most are super safe if used correctly. Just check weight limits and avoid marathon sessions.

Ever wondered why fitness myths spread faster than actual facts? Probably because “instant abs in 10 minutes” sounds way better than “consistent workouts plus healthy eating.”

# Who Should (and Shouldn’t) Use a Vibration Plate

Most people can safely use a **fitness vibration plate**, but there are a few exceptions.

**Good candidates:**

* Busy adults wanting quick workouts.
* **Seniors** looking to improve bone health and balance.
* People recovering from injuries (with doctor approval).
* Anyone who hates traditional cardio.

**Caution advised:**

* Pregnant women.
* People with pacemakers.
* Anyone with severe joint or heart issues (ask your doctor first).

# FAQs About Vibration Plate Machines

**Q1: How long should I use a vibration plate for weight loss?** Start with **10–15 minutes, 3 times per week**, and gradually increase. More isn’t always better—consistency matters most.

**Q2: Can vibration plates replace cardio?** Not completely. They’re a great supplement but don’t fully replace walking, running, or cycling.

**Q3: Are vibration plates good for seniors?** Yes! In fact, **vibration plates for seniors** can improve balance, circulation, and bone density with minimal strain.

**Q4: Will a vibration plate help with knee pain?** Some users find relief using a **vibration plate for knee pain support**. Just keep settings low and consult a physio if unsure.

**Q5: What’s the best vibration plate for small apartments?** Go for a **compact home vibration machine**—lightweight, easy to store, but still powerful enough for results.

# Final Thoughts: Should You Try One?

So here’s my honest take: **a vibration plate isn’t magic, but it’s a fantastic tool.** If you pair it with light exercise and a semi-decent diet, it can definitely help with weight loss, toning, and overall fitness. Plus, it’s fun (and slightly hilarious) the first time you step on and feel like your whole body’s buzzing.

Would I recommend it? **Absolutely—especially if you’re busy, hate traditional workouts, or want a joint-friendly option.** Just don’t expect miracles if you’re still living off soda and late-night pizza.

At the end of the day, the best workout is the one you’ll actually do. And if standing on a **whole body vibration machine** makes you excited to exercise (instead of groaning at your sneakers), then it’s totally worth it.

I chose an M size Even if the S semed to fit well. I just felted more comfortable in the M size. That means there is room for layering. I’m looking for a liner to use in the colder days that are about to come. I live in Paris and winter is always rainy and you get températures fron 5C to -5C.
I’ll be using it to go to work (i use a scooter) and i also spend a lot of time in coffee tables in the street (cause parisian;)
I’m wondering if an Eagle plains jacket liner could work. Does fit comfortably under the SLC? Should I go with a  Filson down liner or the ultralight jacket? I just want to enjoy my SLC as most.",2,1758329466.0,filson,1,1.0,False

It was so sunny that although it was only 20º it was almost hot in the direct sun. For that, I was very grateful. I did not get to write as long as I wanted to because first I had to deliver some pears. Mother and I drove to Darling's house first. They gave me two books to borrow as thanks; The little prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery and a bok of batman comics from the forties. I read a little of The Little Prince as I was waiting in the car for mother to return from grocery shopping. After that, we brought some pears to a friend of father's. Finally, as I was beginning to feel a little sick, we arrived at the library where there is a community fridge. We left three little baskets of pears. One woman was just leaving the fridge when we arrived and she was very delighted to have some fresh fruit for her daughter. All in all, it was a worthwhile time that I was very happy to be done with by the time we got home. My stomach was churning and it took nearly as hour for my hands to stop trembling. It is mother's care specifically that does this to me, I swear. Whatever air-freshener she has in there is as bad as mustard gas, I swear.

I didn't start writing until 4:50 pm. Part of me wanted to abstain from writing at all, I was so queasy and shaky, but I eventually got better enough to focus on the screen. Some juice and a few bites of tart helped. I ended up writing 506 words for I'm Still Sisyphus; not as good as my recent streak but far better than nothing especially knowing I did my best.

I have a slight headache now. I'm hoping a coffee and some relaxing will fix it. Mother bought some angel food cake when she went out after dropping me off again. For some reason, angel food cake is hard to find around her so I am very much looking forward to it. I may have some of that and a pear tonight. We'll see.

Yours & Mine,

1nlkjwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingOverSixty/comments/1nlkjwo/third_date_followup_info/,Third date follow-up info.,"I had my third date with the person I have discussed here in this forum. We have really taken a lot of time to make sure we are understanding each other. Before our date today I specifically asked if we could please just sit down quietly and have conversation without noise around us. It was so helpful. I saw a side of humor that I had not seen. With every relationship there will be bugs to work out. But this person is very special. He's a talented musician in addition to other attributes. Anyway, that's where we're at. Texting regularly. We are just going to take it slow and keep on keeping on. One thing I truly appreciate is the effort that is being made for him to come to my neighborhood. It's a great neighborhood and there's tons of places for us to grab coffee and sit in parks and things and that he is willing to do the train ride is pretty cool.

I pray for Lauren to be able to heal faster than it's taking me, but its sad that I know this type of harm doesnt really go away. 

The burried anger towards mom, the rage inside me, that only surfaced in my mid twenties. 
Everyone tells the victim to ""just forgive her, she is your mom"" , ""your mom is not mentally okay you need to feel sorry for her"" 
people who didnt have manipulative narcisstic moms growing up will never understand.

My mom did her best to ruin my reputation, to let every family membef I have know that im a hoe, she made up things about me, and still does. 
then she calls me saying she misses me, she smiles to me and hugs me like she actually means it.

when I confront her, she says ""I would never do something like that, stop being hateful to me, do you think I could do something so horrible?"" or ""youre imagining stuff""

I was convinced I imagine stuff, I had a lot of memories that faded and only comes to me in pieces. 

today I will see her, I told my doctor to give me something strong beside my regular anti depressant as I will be in a very bad place for sometime after I spend few hours with her. 

Im trying to get ready for her to tear me down. Im scared of her and I dont know why, Im scared of myself of smashing her head and spending the rest of my life in jail, but its all just thoughts.
I will pretend everything is normal, spend the next days in bed crying and surviving off coffee maybe sneak some pills and alcohol when my husband is not around. 
I hate how few hours around my mom, in months, would make me suicidal and very depressed for weeks.

what is driving me crazy, those people who have good moms, why me? its something that cannot be fixed, cant be replaced, cant make it disappear, and nothing heal it.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤
