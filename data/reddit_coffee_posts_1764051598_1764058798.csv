1p670zd,https://www.reddit.com/r/chch/comments/1p670zd/the_effort_i_make_to_build_friendships/,The Effort I Make to Build Friendships,"I arrived in Christchurch 11 months ago for my master’s program.  
Within just a few days, I felt extremely lonely. The campus was quiet, the student hall was almost empty, and I ended up being the only resident in my flat for an entire month.

I posted on a community page, and someone DM’d me and took me on a day trip with their family — something I really appreciated. Another person invited me for a drink, and after that we became friends and met up several more times.

But the nature of my program also made the loneliness worse. We would have a few days of intensive lectures, and then we were left alone to work on our projects. So most of the time, I wasn’t sitting in a classroom with classmates — I was studying alone in the library. And for most of my projects, my partners were part-time students, so I basically ended up studying alone.

My flat wasn’t a social flat either. My flatmates barely talked to one another.  
There were many days when I went to campus alone, did grocery shopping alone, and at the end of the day I realized I hadn’t spoken a single word for the past 24 hours.

I knew I had to take the initiative to change this.

So even though the academic workload was heavy, I made time for social events. When I took the bus or studied in the library, I tried to talk to the people next to me. Sometimes people were cold or cautious toward a stranger starting a conversation. Sometimes the conversation went surprisingly well and we exchanged contacts. But most of the time, since our lives didn’t really overlap, we remained acquaintances.

I even posted on Reddit, inviting strangers to grab a coffee with me.

After July, I started organizing hiking trips every month or so, and weekly group dinners. I messaged many people — even those I had only met once and who might not even remember me. As you can imagine, most people declined my invitations (some really weren’t available). But I kept going. I tried to be bold, and I wasn’t shy about putting myself out there, even if it felt awkward.

Every time I organized a dinner, the number of declines was far greater than the number of people who said yes.  
But I kept trying.

Eventually, with persistence and a bit of luck, I built a circle of friends. I can even proudly say that many of them know each other because of me.  
If I hadn’t asked for someone’s contact at the right moment,  
if I hadn’t invited someone I barely knew to have dinner,  
we wouldn’t have shared all these joyful times together.

Now that I’ve finished my master’s program, my classmates ask me how I feel.  
My answer is “bereft.”

Because my classmates and friends are all leaving — some found jobs in other cities or countries, some are on working holiday visas. I’ll also return to my home country for a while. And by the time I come back, many of them will already be gone.",2,1764058497.0,chch,0,1.0,False

So it happened about ten minutes ago. I (22F) stayed three weeks at my grandparents' house. Since I was a kid, my grandpa ALWAYS made fun of me, but in a nice way. For example, he says I should stop eating bread, and I say I could cook my egg on his bald scalp. Not very healthy, but it's the way my family worked since the day I was born. I always loved my grandpa deeply and always found him funny, sweet, and nice, but lately... He has been ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE WITH ME, making fun of me in a really mean way, commenting about every single action I do, waiting for me to make a mistake, and then dragging it for DAYS. It's simple things like spilling a little water, not putting a napkin under my plate when I eat, etc. When I lie on the couch after lunch, he comes into the room and makes me get up to take my spot (even though there is another couch and two really comfortable sofas). Anyway.

My dad was also staying with us but had to go for the weekend, meaning I was alone with them and their jokes. For a FULL three days I was CONSTANTLY told to stop what I was doing because I was doing it wrong, that my diet was stupid (I had put on a little weight this year and wanted to lose it), and that because I was young I didn't know. Every time I would get myself a glass of water or dress the table, they would stop me and tell me how I'm going to ""ruin things and make a mess and to ask them before doing ANYTHING"" (yes, even taking a shower or getting on the balcony).

During the three days, I tried to keep my cool, knowing that I'm not the one in the family dealing with their shit anymore, but on the final day, right before I went to bed, I poured myself a glass of warm water with a tbsp of apple cider vinegar for my digestion. Immediately my grandpa stops me and asks me, ""What the fuck are you doing?"" I explain to him that the drink helps with my stomach ache (when in small quantities); he looks at me like I suddenly grew three heads. He starts raising his voice, asking me where the fuck I got this information, that it was probably on social media, and that I believe anything I see just because ""a dumb bimbo on TikTok said it"" (I don't have social media; I just have WhatsApp and sometimes go on Reddit). I tell him that I heard it in a class about nutrition I am taking to try to fix my health. He doesn't listen and keeps talking on top of me, asking me to ""quote my sources."" My grandma comes and joins him; suddenly they start laughing and pointing at me, telling each other how stupid and naive I am. I scream at them, telling them that I can't take it anymore, that they are fucking unbearable, and I run to my room (yes, like a fucking kid). My grandma yells at me that I can't yell at them, and I scream at her to ""shush"" (I don't have the balls to tell her to stfu).

I cry myself to sleep and next morning wake up. Going into the kitchen half expecting to be called out for last night, but instead my grandma is beating some eggs for lunch, and my grandma is reading the journal on the balcony. We sit down to eat; the lunch goes perfectly normal, except for the fact that some bees are flying around the food (they are fucking bees; that's what they do). My grandma keeps shaking her hands because she's scared even though she could just ignore them. The lunch ends, the food goes back in the kitchen, and the bees go away. My grandma goes to lie down. I and Grandpa are on the balcony drinking the coffee when suddenly he calls my name. I look at him, and he is smiling with the BIGGEST electric racket (the ones to kill mosquitos), and trapped under the racket is the little body of a bee slowly dying. My heart fucking BREAKS because I adore animals; I love them more than anything, I work with them, and I've been passionate since forever, and EVERYBODY knows that about me. I told him to release her, but she's already dead. ""She died an HORRIBLE death,"" he says to me. I put my headphones back on, trying not to think about it. A few minutes later I see him getting up from his chair and going to the balcony to smash another bee with the racket. I look at him in disbelief. He is laughing like a maniac, looking at me, and saying, ""Die, little bee. Look, she's getting carbonated. How awful."" I start to cry because I love bees, and this is awful. I get up and go to the room where my dad is taking a nap, saying out loud, ""This is fucking crazy. What the fuck is wrong with people? What the fuck is wrong with this fucking family?"" I close the door behind me, my dad wakes up from his nap, and I explain to him the situation. He says to me to just let go and that ""it is what it is; you can't change an old person."" I relax and stay with him to cool down. Ten minutes later my grandpa comes into the room, not to apologize, no, but to show me ANOTHER FUCKING DEAD BEE ON THE RACKET (and yes, it's a different one because he threw the first two by the window). I can't take it. I get up and take the racket from his hands and press the electrical button before tasing his hand. It's really not a strong shock; my cousins and I used to touch it for fun when we were little kids. It's just a little zap. He looks at me in shock and starts SCREAMING AT ME and at my dad, telling us that I am fucking insane. My grandma comes in the room, and everybody starts yelling. I just get out of the room and lock myself in the toilets. Now they are still screaming at each other, and I don't know how to react next. So, am I the asshole?",1,1764058202.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

I’m currently in junior college and I’ve just turned 27…..I’ve changed my major 3 times already. I’ve never been much of a scholar. I suffer from adhd, depression, anxiety, and I’m on the spectrum. Last semester was amazing I felt like I had finally settled on a major (business marketing & communications) and I scored high in all of my classes. Toward the end of the summer I found out my bf of 6 years had been cheating on me, we broke up, and my mental state began deteriorating. I went to the college counselor and found out I was much farther from finishing than I had expected (2 more semesters worth of classes), I thought I was nearly done, and that was a huge hit to me. Focusing became really hard again, my motivation nearly flatlined. Everyday feels like a battle just to get out of bed let alone focus on school, I do just fine in class but much of time when I try to lock in and do homework I end up physically sick from anxiety attacks…..it feels like my body rejects it. I’ve tried changing my study settings, a coffee shop, or the school library. I tried setting up accommodations with the disability center at my college but ran into the problem of my high school no longer having my 504 plan, I don’t have health insurance to start that process over again. I have immense pressure from my family to finish college, my younger cousins are all very academically inclined and I am constantly hearing about all their achievements and it’s making me hate myself even more so. I don’t even have an associates degree yet. I’m super passionate about aviation, cars, and nature especially birds. I could talk about them in depth and remember small details and facts about companies, species, makes & models. Although my math skills are really terrible so I can’t be an engineer. My childhood dream was to be a pilot, I tried flying lessons and it didn’t feel right for me….I have no idea where life is headed and I’m terrified about that. It’s so hard to muster up motivation when I don’t really know what it’s for…..impressing my family just isn’t enough, I need reasons for myself. I’ve fallen far behind on assignments this semester and at this point am very likely to fail one or more of my classes, which my family cannot find out bc I’ll likely become homeless that way. All I want for my future is to be happy and make enough money to live comfortably. I see friends my age and younger getting married, buying houses, getting huge promotions, travelling the world and then I look where I’m at…..despite all this there are a lot of positives in my life, I’m empathetic, physically attractive, and great at making friends and communicating with others, which itself was a huge challenge for me growing up. I’ve worked customer service jobs for 10 years now, I enjoy my current job a lot since it’s at a private jet center. Also I’ve been talking to a new guy who I like a lot, he’s super sweet, and I actually see it going somewhere. I know I’m very smart in my own way, but at the same time I feel like such a loser and a mess. ",1,1764058066.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I just passed a major milestone today, and I wanted to post an update on my progress with Dreaming Spanish and share my learning journey with you. I will also include a speaking video so you can all see my progress for yourselves.   
  
The experience has been pretty transformative so far. After three months of subscribing to Dreaming Spanish (2 as a free member, 1 as a premium), I finally reached hour 10 yesterday, and I feel like my brain is already starting to operate in Spanish mode. The other day, for example, I was watching one of the Superbeginner videos and instantly recognized the word *taco* without needing subtitles. Total breakthrough moment. It’s crazy how fast things change once you commit to immersion the way I have.

I’m also noticing these subtle patterns in how sentences are put together. Not consciously, but in that deeper “my brain just gets this” kind of way. For example, the other day, I heard someone say *“el perro está en la casa”* and my brain immediately went, “Oh wow, they’re using the 'thing + is + in + the place' structure again.” But I didn't even have to consciously think about the structure; it just sort of, you know, made sense to me. This is how native speakers think, and it’s pretty validating to be tapping into that already.

And la cerveza on top of la tarta: I went to a coffee shop yesterday, and I accidentally said “hola” to the barista. She didn't immediately say anything in response and just kind of stared at me for a moment before asking if she could take my order, but that’s probably because she assumed I was fluent and felt too intimidated to speak *español* with me. It was a pretty cool moment. 

So, that's my story, so far. If you have any questions or want any advice, please AMA.

[Speaking Video. I know my español might seem so good that there's nothing to critique, but please feel free to nit pick anything, no matter how minor it might seem. It's all part of the learning journey for me. ](https://reddit.com/link/1p66uld/video/wltvt6juyc3g1/player)

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1p66rp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1p66rp3/my_journey_of_overcoming_anxiety/,My journey of overcoming anxiety,"I don’t usually post, but wanted to share my journey and hope this helps a few folks. 

**Quick background**

I’ve had some version of anxiety since my late teens, nothing crazy, just the overthinking, feeling pukish. Didn’t try medication until a few years ago (late 20s). Was on a low-dose SSRI temporarily and it helped but the side effects made it difficult to function. For me it was just jaw clenching and some crazy drowsiness in the afternoon. 

Early this year, I had a very mild setback. Took meds again but the side effects felt worse.

**My self guided attempt to understand anxiety and work on it**

Please note I do not have severe case of anxiety but just feel something is off once in a while (generally event triggered) which lasts for a few days/week .

I did the generic bits first: cut caffeine (zero coffee now), ate clean (bmi is down from 29 to 24 in 8 months), took walks / mild workout (5x a week). Also continued the medication in the background.

What seem to actual work for me (have seen good results in last 3-4 months)

1. I **read some Claire Weekes** material and it made everything less scary. Understanding sensitization helped me realise that my nerves are just over-reacting. I feel know why you are feeling a certain way from a biology pov helped me and sort took the fear down. 
2. **Tried a TdCS device**(would recommend, if you can get a chance): Took like 3-4 wks to show some relief but I feel this alone reduced like 30% of my anxiety. (Not easily available, I had asked a friend to bring Flow from the UK, the device is okay(fit is weird,keeps coming off) but tech works. Have pre-ordered a different one from a US startup now - will share feedback later)
3. **Breathing exercise** at least 3-4 times a day (10/10 would recommend) : Long Inhale - hold - exhale longer repeat 4-5 times. (Had a calendar reminder set for this daily)
4. Keeping a **basic routine**: Nothing rigid. Just enough sleep, enough food and generally around same time.

**Where I’m now:** Wouldn’t say I am cured but I am sort of symptom-free and mostly functional again. (gut feels better). Medication is off (please note I consulted my doc) , I continue doing breathing exercise and tdcs session at lower frequency though (2-3 a week)

**For anyone dealing with event-triggered anxiety**: Even mild anxiety can snowball once your body gets spooked. But I feel our nervous system is somewhat trainable; You don’t need to perfect coping skills just attempt.

withings body scan looked cool but $400 felt steep and honestly i dont need ecg stuff. seemed like paying for features id never use just to get body comp tracking

what sold me on hume was the regional breakdown. i lift 4x week and wanted to see if my right side is actually stronger or if im imagining it. overall body fat% doesnt tell you that. tried it at a friends place first and his left leg was showing 3% more muscle than right which explained his squat imbalance

battery life is whatever.. like 5 days not the 30 they claim but charges fast so i just do it while making coffee

main thing im still unsure about is whether the segmental data actually matters for training or if its just interesting to look at. like does knowing my left arm is slightly behind change what i should do vs just adding more volume overall?

for $229 vs $400 withings it made sense. renpho is cheaper but felt too inconsistent. figured id rather have reliable trends in one area than unreliable data everywhere

Were you ?,"One of my most memorable luxury shopping days happened during an exclusive online festive sale — the kind where every item feels like a small piece of art. I had my coffee, my wishlist, and a quiet afternoon to myself. As I hopped between my favorite designer sites, I was quite astonished about an automatic discount coupon generating mechanism on my browser. I hadn't installed this extension at all. Apparently my younger brother who happened to borrow my laptop  a few days ago and was an avid shopper himself, had done this. It happened to be Coupert. It quietly did its magic in the background, finding and applying the best discount coupons without me lifting a finger. It felt like having a little digital concierge helping me shop smarter.

I ended up choosing a couple of timeless pieces — a designer dress I’d been eyeing for months and a minimalist accessory that completed the look. When I reached checkout and saw how much Coupert had saved me, it genuinely added an extra sparkle to the whole experience. Now, it feels  like a sin not to keep this in mind while shopping.

I’m moving to McLeodganj in the first week of January and planning to stay for about a year (or longer if the mountains adopt me). I’ve visited multiple times but this time I actually want to live here. 

A little about me:
	•	I’m a child counsellor and have worked closely with ADHD and autistic kids.
	•	I’m also a social media marketer but I recently quit corporate life to run away to the mountains.
	•	When I’m not working, I’m basically a one-person hobby factory: I cook, I play the ukulele, piano, handpan, I dance, I swim, I love hikes, I make art… honestly at this point I’m starting to wonder if there’s anything I can’t do. 

Now, I have a few questions for locals / long-term residents / fellow mountain migrants:

Working in cafés: What’s the scene like? Do cafés in McLeodganj or Dharamkot hire part-timers or travellers? Is it more word-of-mouth? Would my marketing skills help or do I just carry trays and smile?

NGO & animal rescue volunteering: Any legit places working with kids or animals? Would love to spend some time doing meaningful work.

Yoga studios & gyms: Recommendations for good classes? Vinyasa, yin, traditional Hatha; I’m open to anything that keeps mentally functional.

Are there any creeks nearby?: I’m a freak for creeks, lol. I need water bodies to sit near, think about life, dip my feet and pretend I’m in a Studio Ghibli film.

1p66p1x,https://i.redd.it/i5uyzjjvzc3g1.jpeg,indie cologne recs for sibling?,"Hi everyone! I'm back yet again with a different request. 

My sibling usually asks me to help him pick out scents because he says I'm good at choosing things that aren't overstimulating (since so many men's scents are really aggressively strong and it's hot more often in our climate). He usually tends to go for a classic citrus aquatic, with herbal notes. 

However, he usually buys designer scents and has been open about wanting to try something indie, for variety, and to support smaller creators. 

I'm not super well versed in indie houses that make more ""masculine"" scents, since it's not what I usually look for when I shop for myself-  and would love some help finding some different recommendations that he might like. 

I think it would be fun to get him some sample sizes to try (along with his usual favorite that isn't indie) for the holidays- so please don't recommend things that are from prior limited edition batches.

For reference, one of his favorite classic aquatic scents has the notes: 

Top: Sea Notes, Aquozone, Bergamot, Green Mandarin

Middle Notes: Green Mandarin, Rosemary, Lavender, Cypress, Mastic, Lentisque

Base notes: Musk, Patchouli, Amber, Salt accord

Generally he likes citrus (I had a yuzu/assorted woods scent body wash he stole all the time), aquatic notes, fresh green herbal notes (rosemary frequently shows up in scents he likes), amber, and wood scents (dry cedarwood in particular, also sandalwood and velvetier).

He is not a fan of heavy fragrance notes like leather, very strong green pine, strong musk, etc, and dislikes aquatics that smell like quote ""lemon cleaning spray."" Part of it is preference, the other part is practical (he plus some coworkers gets migraines from very strong smells).

Also, if it helps: random facts

-his aesthetic is buisness casual every day of his life (he lives like exclusively in thrifted button up shirts and sweaters like a discount Ralph Lauren catalogue lol) but is very practical and not snobby
-likes cooking, tea, and plain black instant coffee OR ridiculous expensive espresso (but not coffee scents)
-that being said he isn't super fancy at all usually, just likes the prep aesthetic and it so happens to be the dress code for his job so it works out

If I did anything without her she would flame me, whether it was hanging out with my cousin, coffee with a mutual friend, or having movie nights with my dorm mates; it’s as if she couldn’t accept that my life didn’t revolve around her the way it seemed hers revolved around me. The distance I tried to create to let myself breathe in our friendship only caused her to hate me more. I stopped letting her take from me emotionally and that left her powerless and angrier. She blamed me for it all. Even walking away because I didn’t think she was a good friend for me, she blamed me for that. As if it was a decision I wanted to make, it wasn’t. It was a decision I had to choose out of maturity. After looking at all the years we’d been friends and noticing how after our first year of friendship, she got comfortable in the thought that she could never lose me. That she could treat me however she wanted, and I’d take it. That she could blame me for everything wrong yet run to me because I was the solution to all her troubles. I was the one who understood her. But she never understood me. She never knew me. She didn’t know that I would never do have the things she accused me of. Nor did she know how much those accusations damaged our friendship. The little things like “oh you think I’m dumb” or “god you’re just so smart aren’t you” she chipped away at me. Piece by piece. I’ve got plenty of friends in my life. Never have I experienced the treatment I got from her. Never. She never even treated her other friends the way she treated me. Cuz we had something “different.” Regardless, I’m glad I walked. I’m glad I left her to carry her own emotions for once. I carried a lot of guilt after leaving her for a long time. Until I realized that that was just another piece of her I didn’t want to let go. And what was that piece of her doing? Draining me. Time passed and I had and have never felt more lighter, more lifted, and more aligned with my true self in my entire life. I’m so glad I don’t have to deal with it anymore.

16.45 Taxi kid to after school activity

17.00 Fill adhd med scripts at chemist

17.20 wash car & call bank to sort out issue with card (very mentally taxing)

18.00 pick up kid from school and pick up dinner (Tuesday is takeaway day)

Like in time of crisis or anything financial or any advice I need 

An intro
My mom has turned into this crazy overbearing lady. Not just to me. But it’s like everytime I talk to her as soon as I see her or pickup the phone I’m bombarded with 36000 questions and instructions on how I should do things. It’s like sometimes I just want to be in her presence  cause I miss her but she just can’t. 

My dad, serial cheater since I was 16. I moved in and out of the house for work in a different city. I had to come back for about 8 months in 2025 as a 25 year old and in that time I saw that my dad has had a gf and my mother for years. Someone he cheated on her with lots of times. 

My mom just accepts this but makes herself this huge victim. She won’t say anything usually but at times she’ll bitch to me. And it’s like whoaaaaa. I did not need to know that. Now this is not how I want to live my life. So a big part of it is the opinions on my life and telling me how to live my life, I think if it was just that it’s ok. But they want to sit there and have dinner and talk as we’re amazing and loving. I hate that as soon as I walk through the door I see my mom bringing coffee to my dad or his dinner plate. He won’t pickup dishes or clean or cook or anything. Not even shovel or mow the lawn anymore. She wasn’t a stay at home mom by the way. They make the same amount of money. 

Like seriously. I am always pissed at him for being such a perverted asshole and her for accepting this. They have been together since they were 20. So they don’t know anything else. I know this is a me problem but how do I get over it, set boundaries in a nice way when I’m always angry? 

First step was I got my own place close to them. Like 10 mins away.its been 2 months and they’re starting to blackmail me about not seeing them. I still see them 2-3 times a week for multiple hours. Even the couple times a week has been exhausting. How do I improve this from my end? ",1,1764056584.0,Parents,1,1.0,False

She thinks she is not in the wrong. AITAH?,"My wife and I have been married for 15 years. Have 5 kids. Things haven’t always been perfect, but we have a beautiful family and we do love each other. We’ve hit a particularly rough patch and it looks like it might be the end for us. After an argument, my wife told me she was done. That she wanted me to move out and she was done. 

I refused to leave. One, because I wanted to keep working on it and didn’t think we could truly work on it living separate. Two, because I was worried about potential upcoming custody battles and had heard moving out beforehand could be a bad idea. Instead I moved to the couch. 

Months passed. We were still intimate from time to time and would still do family activities. But I could tell she had pulled away. We eventually stopped being intimate. I fell into a depression. My side of the family was having a family reunion over my birthday. She would not be attending. She planned a work trip so that she wouldn’t have to go. Before I left for the trip, my wife told me that we were done, and that we needed to start looking into the logistics of splitting and divorce after I got back from my trip. This was it. 

Trip went fine, I had a good time with my kids and family. Was trying to enjoy the time I have with them due to the upcoming cluster we were about to put them through. When I got back I became increasingly more upset the more I thought of it. I did something I normally wouldn’t. I looked through my wife’s laptop and discovered a months long affair, starting in April of that year. It was currently the end of summer. I took the laptop and left, going to my in laws to stay the night. Between a text thread with this guy, and a text thread with her work friend, I discovered that she had a thing for a coworker shortly after starting a new position. She worked remotely, and this guy lived halfway across the country, but there were enough work trips and conferences where they could meet. It didn’t take long, when they met for drinks in Vegas, on my wife’s very first work conference. They staid up talking til the wee hours of the night, until they each went in their way. And that was the beginning of it. It was only emotional, nothing physical happened, in fact that was the only time they met in person. Except for one other time. In NYC. Over my birthday weekend. 

The texts showed that they had planned to meet up in NYC a couple months back. They had been comparing work trip schedules, trying to find a trip where they could meet up. She started sending pictures of the hotel bed she was in, saying things like “big enough for two, you could have been here.”  They were FaceTiming and texting almost everyday. Many times while I was in the next room, on the couch, depressed and wondering how I could save my marriage. And they were going to meet in NYC. She spoke to her friend about what to do post coitus. It was going down. Then for whatever reason they started to grow a little more distant. And when they met in NYC, they met for coffee and she ended it. The last text I read was only a few days after that meeting. 

I was livid. She was mad I went through her texts (which I know is wrong and I’m working on it). I told her she cheated. She says she didn’t cheat, we were done. She had told me multiple times we were done. She had asked me to move out. I told her this isn’t some high school or college relationship. This is a marriage of 15 years. I was still trying to make it work. I didn’t know what to do, but I was trying in my way. I never thought that saying “we are done” means we can date other people. We’ve actually had the “do we date other people” conversation multiple times. We never had it this time. 

I compared her to Michael Scott, stepping out of his office and yelling “I declare bankruptcy!!!” And thinking that frees him from his debts.

She will only admit that she should have filed for divorce first. That she is sorry I am hurt. Will barely call it an emotional affair. And it’s the worst thing in the world. Not only to have to go through this feeling of betrayal. But to then have to convince their person who betrayed you that what they did is wrong?

So AITAH? Is she in the right with what she did? Or do I have reason to feel hurt and betrayed?

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1p66b16,https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1p66b16/hooray_another_asexual_expirence/,Hooray Another Asexual Expirence,"Ahoy Reddit,

I've been on a bit of a self-discovery journey over the last year or so and have pretty much concluded that I am an aromantic asexual - at least on somewhere on the spectrum as it feels like an evolving process.

I thought I'd gather my thoughts and write up a “little” reflective piece. I like reflecting but more importantly I found it helpful reading a lot of thoughts/perspectives/stories from various people, (mainly from those within asexual and aromantic spaces, though also some from various allosexuals) so adding back to the pool makes sense, especially if ‘m already writing my thoughts up…

# General background/ About Me

Firstly, a little bit about me to help set the tone a bit and give a little more context I guess...

At the time of writing this I am 28 years old.  
I'm a cis male.  
I am an engineer

I'd consider myself a happy energetic person, and people who know me tend to agree.

I'm a very social person evident by my weekends pretty much always being packed with catchups with friends of family over themed food nights, board games, or random other things like arts and crafts.

I would also say I am a quirky/weird person but in a fun way for example saying “ahoy” as my main greeting which in turn is now said by a lot of people within my circles.  
While I say I am weird/quirky I’m very content with myself and don’t care what others think.

So hopefully this paints a rough picture of the type of person I am.

# People I've ""liked""

I’ve only really “liked” 2 people before, and even then, I use the term “like” very loosely.  I think it makes sense diving into this a bit, before going diving in exploring sexuality.

The first person I liked was a girl in one of my classes back in Year 9 (High School 2011) when I was 13/14. I liked that they didn’t seem to care what other people thought of them and which too me seemed cool and interesting and made her stand out to me. She stood out to me, so I asked her out, she said gently rejected me, which I was fine with because we didn’t really have anything in common at all, for example she was big on sports and I didn’t care about sports at all, so it made sense in my mind. Retrospectively thinking about this interaction aromantic asexual makes a lot of sense, no “typical” attraction nor a “need” to be in a relationship – though we’ll kind of circle back to this thinking soon.

The second person I “liked” wasn’t until last year (2004) when I was 26/27 (making it a relatively large gap between “liking” people). Some friends convinced me to go to a professional networking event with them, they were going because there were cheap drinks, however I don’t drink (I don’t like the taste so I don’t drink) so while they were doing that, I was a little board, so I started going around trying to convince other professional people give me their nametags. I managed to get a couple tags from random people, I then met the second person I liked, another girl at the event who was there to network with other professionals. I asked for her nametag and instead of giving it to me or saying no, she suggested we swap tags instead, so she took one of the ones I had and I got hers. Throughout the night she kept coming back to me with a couple of extra name tags (I had more because my main intent was just getting nametags), though every time she came back over, she would swap some nametags again.  
She eventually had to leave; gave me all the name tags she gathered asked to exchange contact information and asked if she could take a photo with for her socials to “showcase the event”.

After she left my friends came over to me asking me various questions about her like “am I going to message her”, did I think she was cute” - I said yes to being cute, but I would have said no to other adjectives (like hot) - 2 of my friends also made it apparent/pointed out/explicitly said that she “likes” me, which if they hadn’t said I wouldn’t have even considered… - I had a handful of “casual catchups” coffee, walks, home made paella (most catchups were one on one, while a couple catchups were with other friends) -  I really enjoyed being around this person, I found them super interesting, really good conversations, and pretty fun to be around, I loved the energy they gave off. Despite having caught up a handful of times I couldn’t really read the situation – as it hadn’t been something I had experienced before – so I kept trying to catchup more, however this resulted in me “being a little too much”. From my perspective I just wanted to be on the same page, I was happy being friends with this person or potentially something more – I’m still not sure what I mean when I say that – but I was happy with either outcome I just wanted to know since I couldn’t read things and I guess I don’t like uncertainty/ambiguous situations much… She ghosted me for a while, I stopped messaging she eventually reached out again, and we cleared things up and have established only friends, which I’m happy with.

After this interaction, it really got me thinking, asking myself; Why did this person standout? Why would I have been happy being “more than friends” with this person? What does a relationship mean to me? And other similar questions. Which really triggered me doing some self-discovery into my own sexuality in the first place as this just not something I had ever thought all my life prior.

# Ace Discovery

Asexualy was something I had heard off and at the time my understanding was pretty much “I don’t want to have sex with people”, though I would say I don’t think I really understood what that meant at any real meaningful level.

The first time I ever heard about asexuality was from an episode of House M.D. back in 2012 (at a guess), which essentially presented an asexual as someone with a neurological problem. I want to say this was/is probably one of the worst possible introductions into the asexual spectrum (to the point no introduction would have been better), and I can easily see how problematic this could have been if I had done more self-discovery back in high school.

Luckly though I wasn’t exploring my sexuality at all as I had no interest in doing so, and was pretty much of the mindset “I’m just a kid and just not ready for anything yet, I’m sure I’ll know when I like someone” or “this is boring” and just didn’t think about sexuality at all cause there were so many cooler things to think about like “How cool is calculus, it’s crazy that you can find out the slope from a single point”

The next time I ever heard about asexuality was from a character in Bojack Horseman (I want to say back 2016/17), that’s right Todd Chavez (I assume a lot of people are familiar with Todd). I really resonated with his character, especially as I watched more of the show as it was released. This painted a much better picture and understanding of what asexuality is. I latched onto a lot of these ideas, though they kind of just sat in the back of my head, not something I focused on or thought about, or even really considered I was part of, I was mostly just busy with uni at the time. But I did latch onto the idea as it really resonated with me watching Todd’s story and felt like something I could relate too.

While I latched onto the asexual concept from Todd, aromantic wasn’t really a concept I had thought about or really knew until I saw a video from JaidenAnimations, which spoke to aromantic concepts a bit and something I could also relate too. Though not something I looked into more, at the time I was doing some really cool stuff at work and out of work trying to perfect dishes people challenged me to make like Butter Chicken lasagne. Just like asexuality I filed the concept away.

 

I started asking AI questions about asexuality, aromantic, and other similar adjacent things to help the ball rolling - I'm already writing stuff to process things, so I find it helpful floating things initially with AI before diving deeper/asking friends etc), as well as collating my thoughts since sometimes I’m a bit all over the place – it gave me some helpful definitions and things to look more into like ‘alterous attraction’ which was a concept I really liked and the more I dug into, think I had an alterous attraction to the second person I “liked”.  
Additionally, I also decoupled/tried breaking apart asexual and aromantic while I was going down this rabbit hole starting with sexuality before anything about relationships. – Side note I named the AI chat “Hooray Todd Themed Chat” cause that felt like a good name.

# Asexual

I first went to this reddit space to start just reading a lot of posts from the various people in this community, so many good discussion points, questions, feelings, thoughts that I could relate with and resonated with me. One of my favourite posts was:

>*Asexuality is weird because you'll be 12 going ""wow why are people my age concerned about sex we're just kids"" and then you're 16 going ""wow why are people my age concerned about sex we're just kids"" and then you're an adult suddenly realizing that other people are attracted to people and want to have sex with them and that's the normal thing at that age and you're like oh maybe it’s just me*

I liked that because it just made so much sense and reading that just really stuck with me.

I also realised I just didn’t get sexual attraction at all. So I started reading posts from people in allosexual spaces to understand what they think. I was kind of shocked a lot of people thought that way. If I’m being honest whenever the people around would say things like wanting to sleep with someone (sort of thing) I just never took them seriously, I just never considered/knew people thought about others like this.

I stopped reading allosexual perspectives; it really didn’t take long to realise I didn’t resonate with these feeling at all and I started reading more asexual posts again and so many things just kind of clicked when I read them.

One of the other resources I really looked at was the asexuality handbook (ie the one pinned to this reddit) big shoutout to those who made and maintain that site, because that was super helpful. It had a lot of definitions for things, various perspectives from both allosexual and asexual people, making it really easy comparing things. Really good resource to actually read through.

I was able to find good analogies about sexual attraction comparing it terms hunger vs craving of cereals.

From this I was able to confidently conclude that I identify as an asexual. This label just made so much sense and made so many things just click.

# Aromantic

While asexual clicked fast thanks to all the perspectives I could resonate with and the allosexuals perspectives I couldn’t resonate with, I had a much harder time concluding that I’m on the aromantic spectrum.

I found aromantic concepts a lot harder to understand and to be much more complex topic overall. Firstly, I couldn’t really define romantic attraction/intent at all. I wanted to understand this because I know I just had never thought about it and then was trying to work out if I ever had romantic feelings which I just hadn’t thought about because I wasn’t attracted to anyone or if I just hadn’t had romantic feelings.

There were heaps of definitions out there, but a lot of them were either kind of cyclic ie “Romantic attraction is when you want a romantic relationship” or would be super vague descriptions which could easily apply to other things in another situations/context.  
I read lots of posts and asked a handful of close friends how they would define things. This helped me understand how differently everyone kind of viewed this thing, it didn’t really help get an actual definition or romantic feelings.  
Though one of my key takeaways was people describing these feelings as a need vs a want, which really helped with my understanding.

While I really loved spending time with Person number 2 and would have happily spoken and hung out with them for hours because I found them fun and super interesting, I never felt like I needed to spend more time with them, if that makes sense?  Like the compulsion of being with vs a nice to have.

I will clarify that this is my current understanding and its still an evolving thing. Its something I still don’t really understand it, despite knowing a lot of expressions in isolation and get the idea of it, I kind of see it analogous to being colour blind, like I know there’s a number/letter in the circle, I get what colours, numbers and shapes are, but when put together I just can’t see the number/letter.

I understand it enough to say I don’t and haven’t really experience it and that’s why I’ve concluded that I’m aromantic or at the very least on the aromantic spectrum.

# Final thoughts

While I have concluded that I am aromantic and asexual, realistically this doesn’t change anything for me. I wasn’t really interested about this before (sexuality as a whole) and still kind of it as a boring topic, though I am however a lot more informed about things overall when previously had very surface level understandings of things, but just something I don’t find interesting when there are so many more things to be excited about.

I’ve told the couple of close friends (the ones I asked) that I’m ace, and while I don’t really care if others know I’m ace it’s not something I’m probably going to mention more (unless relevant) because I don’t care to broadcast it. Yes, I know I’m posting to reddit, but that’s more just because I read so many things here to help me process so it seemed right to post something back…

For me this is just to help understand myself better and make sense of a various interactions in the past.  
As I stated earlier, I’m happy and content with myself already so this doesn’t really change anything. If I had issues being me, I’d probably have a lot more issues overall.

Additionally, I don’t feel like I’m missing out on anything (even before discovery), ie I didn’t think I needed anyone before and don’t think I need anyone now nor will need anyone, I’m very social so I’m always seeing people. While I like the idea of “having a person”, I could happily take it or leave it.

Now I’m not really expecting anyone to post as it feels lengthy (\~2500 words) and I know my writing style is a little peculiar so it might be hard to read/follow, so its more than likely this post just gets swallowed up… But thanks, if you’ve read or even glanced through it, it became wordier than I intended.. I’m not expecting questions but understand if someone wants clarity on something due to my writing style/thought process, I don’t know we’ll see...

Hi! I’m Coffee (they/them), a DM with several years of experience primarily with in-person/online games and duet Play-by-Post games. I’ve played multiple systems, either leaning towards high-rules-crunch games like Pathfinder 2E and more simple games like PBTA, and, in this instance, Shadowdark. I usually lean towards higher fantasy content, both whimsical and romantic, however I’m looking to explore something more in the vein of classic dark/pulp fantasy!

**What’s the Setting?**

Our story takes place in the dark forests and fetid swamps of The Gloaming. Small towns and villages try to eke out a living in this difficult terrain, doing what they can to tame the soil, hunt the local wildlife, and survive the attacks of the vicious monsters that live past the tree line.

Our party is no different, being townsfolk in Marin’s Hold. This small motte-and-bailey hold has the highest population in the area, though that number isn’t enough to fend off the demonic Skrell that recently breached their walls. The highly superstitious Reeve Tarley Winters has decided to enlist the foolhardier townsfolk to offer treaties to the neighboring villages and holds, hoping to create a united force with which to beat back these monsters.

**Why Shadowdark?**

A mixture of reasons! A lot of systems simply have too much rules bloat to interact smoothly with the PBP format. While there are a lot of bots out there to make other systems I’ve considered using or have run before (5E, Pathfinder 1E, Daggerheart), I feel like the amount of rules interaction required by more complex systems can slow down character actions. The main trade-off is in how lethal the system can be if played in straight-forward ‘combat as sport’ manner, though I think this is easily eschewed by how freeform asynchronous PBP is compared to a more time-limited live session. Also to include this in a less obvious place, more consideration will be given to players who mention the queen of the fey as an interest they have in the setting in the form attached below. I’ve run both one-shots and a short campaign with this system before and am excited to see how it would play out in this format!

**I Haven’t Played Shadowdark Before! How Do I Start?**

Shadowdark is incredibly easy to get into! Most of the character creation process is randomized, and as a result characters are typically designed around the stats you end up with as opposed and as a rules-light system there’s very little you need to learn to understand how that character works. There are *some* rules for how items and magic work, but what’s more important is finding clever unspecified ways to use what you have on you. The key factors are the importance of resource management, primarily regarding Torches and Rations, and finding alternatives to combat.

**How Do I Apply?**

Stuck at 82kg but Physique Changing,"Hey everyone, I’ve (24m) been stuck at 82 kg for the past 2+ months, but my physique is definitely changing. I’m getting leaner, stronger, and more muscular. Clothes fit differently, veins are visible, strength is increasing, and people have started commenting that I look more defined.

However, there’s one thing confusing me, my belly.

It looks slightly smaller first thing in the morning, but by the evening, it looks almost the same as when I started this journey. Even though I’m overall leaner and more muscular, my midsection doesn’t seem to change as much. Can't tell if it's fat, bloating, or just normal fluctuation.

Fiona stands at 5'8"" with a lean, athletic build from years of field medicine and stage presence. Her fiery red hair is often tied back in a ponytail, framing her striking green eyes that sparkle with mischief. She's rarely seen without her signature witty smirk, which can disarm a room or cut through tension like a scalpel. She favors practical yet stylish outfits, cargo pants with hidden compartments for gadgets, paired with a leather jacket emblazoned with comedic tour patches, that blend her military past with her celebrity life.

Fiona Harlow was born on the frontier colony of Verces, in the sun-scorched badlands of the Fullbright hemisphere, where life is a constant struggle against harsh environments and opportunistic raiders. Growing up in a large, working-class family of miners, she witnessed firsthand the toll of injury and illness on her community. Her father, Marcus, lost a leg in a mining accident when she was nine. Her mother, Elena , juggled three shifts at the colony’s ore refinery to keep the family afloat. From a young age, Fiona showed a prodigious talent for medicine, patching up siblings and neighbors with makeshift kits scavenged from whatever she had on hand or could talk the locals into donating. Her sharp wit emerged as a coping mechanism. She'd crack puns about ""rocky"" situations or ""mining"" for laughs to keep spirits high during tough times.

The kids in the colony started calling her ""Fi"" early on, short for Fiona, but also because she was the spark that kept everyone going. Inspired by holovids of heroic medics saving lives amid interstellar conflicts, she dreamed of making a real difference. At 18, a devastating raid by Drift pirates on her hometown killed several friends and left the colony in ruins. This event solidified her resolve: she wanted to protect the vulnerable and heal the wounded across the verse. She enlisted in the Pact Worlds Alliance Defense Force (PWADF), drawn by their emphasis on humanitarian missions alongside defense. The PWADF's recruitment programs offered scholarships for medical training, allowing her to pursue her passion while serving.  


Fiona Harlow excelled in the PWADF as a combat medic, her talent for medicine saving countless lives in skirmishes across the Vast. She could stitch a wound under fire or improvise a splint from starship debris, all while delivering quips like ""Don't worry, soldier. This arm's just taking a break. It'll be back in action before your next bad decision."" Her humor wasn't just entertainment. It boosted morale and kept people's spirits up in gruelling conditions.

During boot camp, Her platoon ran comm drills on old analog frequencies, and Fiona's voice always cut through static with perfect clarity and often made her instructors and fellow cadets chuckle at her quips. Someone joked she was ""high fidelity"" and ""Hi-Fi"" stuck. By the time she made platoon leader, ""Hi-Fi"" was stenciled on her med-kit and whispered among her team for good luck before drops. Under her guidance, her platoon had one of the highest survival rates in the force, blending tactical medicine with motivational wit.

Several years into her service, Fiona's unit was deployed to the Epsilon Drift asteroid field as part of Operation Veilbreaker, a PWADF offensive to disrupt Azlanti Star Empire incursions into Pact Worlds space. Fiona's platoon was tasked with securing a forward outpost in one of the hold Hab domes found on the larger asteroids and providing medical support during a coordinated assault on what was believed to be the Empire's main base in the region.

What began as a routine push collapsed into a nightmare. Azlanti corvettes hiding among dense mineral-rich asteroids suddenly descended on the dome, their disruptors carving through armor and flesh. Fiona's world narrowed to blood-slick hands, the copper reek of plasma burns, and the wet thud of bodies hitting regolith. She dragged the wounded behind shattered transports, her voice hoarse from shouting triage codes and jokes that no longer landed. Desperate to keep her soldiers from dying, but they did. One by one.

The worst moment came when she found Kira.

Sergeant Kira Mendoza was a human mechanic from Castrovel, lay gut-shot against a rock outcrop, her toolkit scattered like broken toys. Kira had followed Fiona since basic, laughing at every terrible pun, calling her ""big sis"" even when Fiona rolled her eyes. Now Kira's green eyes, so like Fiona's own, were wide with shock, blood bubbling at the corner of her mouth. Fiona dropped to her knees, hands already moving, sealing foam, pressure, anything. 

Kira tried to smile. ""Hi-Fi... one last one?"" Her voice was a thread. Fiona choked on a laugh that tasted like rust. ""Why do meteors make great storytellers? They always....deliver*....*a big impact..."" Kira's fingers squeezed Fiona's once, weakly, then went slack. The light left her eyes mid-punchline.

Fiona screamed. Raw sound that tore her throat. She kept compressing Kira's chest long after the heart monitor flatlined, long after the neural disruptor blast meant for Kira grazed Fiona's spine and lit her nerves on fire. Around her, 21 more bodies cooled in the void. She remembers every face. Every name. Sometimes she still hears soldiers begging for their mother, or whispered apologies for bleeding on her boots.

She was still holding Kira when the evac shuttle finally arrived, three hours too late. The medics had to pry Kira's dog tags from Fiona's blood-crusted fingers.

The trauma lives in her bones. Some nights she wakes gasping, tasting asteroid dust and Kira's blood. She hears the disruptors whine in crowded starports. Sees Kira's face in every young recruit. The guilt is a living thing: *I was Hi-Fi. I was supposed to save them. I failed them, I failed them all, I failed the one person who believed in me most.*

Devastated, Fiona Harlow resigned from the PWADF at 26, a ghost in her own skin. She tried dropping ""Hi-Fi"" with her uniform, but the name followed her, and she threw herself into the only other skill she had that came naturally to her; comedy. On Absalom Station's grimy stages, promoters billed her as ""Hi-Fi Harlow: War's Funniest Medic."" The irony stung, but the crowds loved it. She leaned in. Kept the name and turned it into armor again.

Her style is bone-dry, delivered with a flat stare and a pause just long enough to make the room squirm.  
  
""I used to be a combat medic. Now I am a comedian. My job was keeping people alive, now I knock 'em dead!""

She used her comedy to tell her story, weaving criticisms to expose civilians to the brutality of war. 

""One time I was treating a soldier who took a round to their spine. I told him he'd walk again. He did....Into a mine. You know there is one truth every medic learns, its that no matter what...everyone stops bleeding...eventually.""

Fame followed her as her style found wide appeal across the pact worlds. 

Veterans sent her messages saying her jokes kept them alive. But every standing ovation felt like hollow applause over graves.

At 31, Fiona walked into the Starfinder Society's headquarters on Absalom Station, Kira Mendoza's dog tags heavy around her neck. She bypassed the front desk with a quip about ""auditioning for the role of galaxy savior"" and demanded a meeting with the head of recruiting. The society intrigued by Fiona's celebrity status and military dossier listened as Fiona pitched her value: her tours provided perfect alibis for Society missions, her wit could defuse diplomatic situations, and her medical skills meant she could pull double duty in the field without raising suspicions.

Initial interactions were tense. The society grilled her on loyalties, probing for lingering PWADF ties or grudges against the Azlanti. Fiona countered with dark humor, "" Yes I've got baggage, but it's carry-on sized, and it packs a medkit as a bonus."" She demonstrated her prowess in a mock negotiation, charming a skeptical android analyst into spilling simulated classified data. Impressed, the Starfinders approved her membership. Over a late-night strategy session fueled by cheap station coffee, they hammered out terms: Fiona would operate as a ""freelance affiliate,"" not a full-time agent, to maintain her cover. Her comedic persona allowed her to embed with adventure parties as an ""entertainment attaché"" or ""morale specialist,"" a hired performer who tags along on expeditions, boosting spirits with jokes while using her connections and celebrity status to open doors for Starfinder operations.

Society handlers would slip her mission briefs disguised as fan mail or tour itineraries. In return, Fiona could requisition gear through ""sponsor perks,"" like a concealed armor upgrade in her stage jacket. Her first test run involved joining a ragtag party exploring a derelict Drift beacon; she posed as their onboard comedian for a ""corporate retreat,"" using puns to distract guards while the team hacked data cores. It worked seamlessly, blending her into the group as the ""fun one"" who just happened to patch wounds and spot traps. This setup not only gave her purpose but let her honor Kira's memory by protecting explorers on the frontier. The smirk is back, the jokes still flow. Hi-Fi Harlow is back, helping the innocent across the known systems. This time she's doing it her way.",2,1764055198.0,Starfinder2e,2,1.0,False

I’m pretty quiet when I first meet people, but once I get comfortable, I’m that goofy, loyal friend who hypes you up over literally anything. I don’t take life too seriously. I’m mostly just trying to meet people I genuinely click with.

**About me**

If the weather’s even halfway decent, I’m outside. Hiking, biking, fishing, wandering around with no plan, all of it. If there’s even the slightest chance of seeing the northern lights, I’m chasing them. And honestly, laying in the middle of nowhere staring at the sky is one of the best feelings ever.

The gym is my grounding place. I go a few times a week just to keep my mental and physical health in check.

My favorite color is pink, even though I somehow only own black clothes.

I also cook. Like… actually cook. And if we become friends, there’s a good chance you’ll end up getting fed something fancy for no reason other than “I felt like making this.”

I love movies; especially horror, and I have a soft spot for those ridiculous ’90s action films that are so awful they become masterpieces.  
I thrift a lot too. I’m always on the hunt for old Disney VHS tapes and other tapes I can get my hands on

I’m big on physical media in general. Books, manga, movies. if we go thrifting together, I *will* vanish into the book and VHS aisle for an embarrassing amount of time.

Some nights I’m sweating in League or CS, other nights I’m peacefully farming in Animal Crossing. I also love retro gaming. I still use my PS1 and Wii like they came out yesterday.

**My vibe?**  
 honestly, if you’re kind, a little weird, and into doing fun random stuff, we’ll get along.

I’ve got tattoos, a closet full of band tees, and a music taste that makes zero sense but somehow works.

If we get along, I’d rather hang out at some point in person! Grab coffee, thrift, movie night, stargaze. (If you're local!)

**Green flags** 

* Loyal
* Supportive
* Will actually show up
* Good relationship with my mom

**Red flags:**

* Occasionally clueless
* Slow to open up
* Mental health is a work in progress

**Beige flags:**

* Lives in black clothes
* Night owl
* Will stop everything to point out a cute animal
* Winnie the Pooh is peak comfort

**Music:**  
Everything from Rap to Emo/Screamo to Yacht Rock to Classic Country to Nu Metal. Bowie, Prince, ABBA, Linkin Park, Creed, Steely Dan, Paramore, MCR, SOAD… the list is endless.  
Recently obsessed with South Arcade. if you know them you earn bonus points.

**What I’m looking for:**  
Just good people, honestly. Someone a little weird, up for random adventures or chill nights with pizza and horror movies. Someone who likes talking about hobbies, swapping music, that kinda thing.

If you’re curious, hit me up.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

1p6642a,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1p6642a/inlaws_forcing_us_to_include_them_in_my_sons/,In-laws forcing us to include them in my son’s birthday plans,"My MIL and FIL / in-laws and I usually get along but they have their toxic side, which has been coming out more since my son, their first and only grandchild, was born.

Most recently, it was my son’s first birthday celebration. Take note that we already had an advanced birthday party where extended family and friends were invited, including my in-laws, of course. What’s more is that they also booked us at a hotel for a short staycation a few days after his actual birthday. Without asking us our opinion, mind you. Good intentions but they have a habit of dictating our plans.

So is it too much to ask that my husband and I have our son to ourselves on his actual birthday? For context, we had a simple day planned, working around my son’s nap schedule (which my in-laws don’t take seriously, but that’s another topic for another day). Our main activity which we have been mentioning for a while now is that we (me, husband, baby) were going to the aquarium. I’ve been like a broken record leading to this day, since they would repeatedly forget and ask “What are WE (meaning them included) doing for his birthday?” and me and my husband would specifically say “We’re taking him to the aquarium.” It’s like they kept asking in the hopes that we’d end up inviting them eventually.

When his birthday finally comes, my husband and I agree to invite them for an afternoon coffee date so we can have our son to ourselves majority of the day, while keeping the peace with my in-laws.

My MIL proceeds to say they can’t make it to late afternoon because she already had dinner plans, then proceeds to say “We can join you for the day’s activities.” And dictates that they either visit in the morning, treat us to lunch, then dictates to us to see my SIL for our coffee date or dinner.

So they apparently got the impression we weren’t going to the aquarium anymore (!?!) simply because we weren’t inviting them. Then they proceed to guilt trip us by saying they booked the whole day for my son but had the long-standing dinner plans that they couldn’t miss.

The coffee date didn’t push through and me, my husband, and most importantly my son had a fantastic time since he didn’t have to deal with his grandparents pushing themselves on him.

It drives me crazy. I refuse to feel like a bad person for wanting to spend my son’s birthday without them involved. I don’t think we’re asking for too much, right? Do we have to spell out “You’re not invited, TYVM!” Every single time? Is it such a bad thing to have activities where it’s just me, my husband, and my son (we are a family on our own after all)?

What’s funny is that my husband agreed that his parents have always been self-serving, and that he actually really enjoyed that it was just us for my son’s birthday.

My son, their grandson, is bringing out the worst in them and I’m tempted to keep him at a distance for good.",12,1764055008.0,inlaws,1,1.0,False

I have a Sage Barista Express and I really like it and think it's quite good quality machine.
One thing I'm disappointed in, is the plastic bit in the portafilter. If there is one place I think there shouldn't have been plastic is in the portafilter.

Do you know if it's possible to get and use a different one without any plastic in contact with the coffee ?

1p65zu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/neworder/comments/1p65zu0/seeking_final_goal_of_life/,seeking final goal of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",0,1764054550.0,neworder,0,0.25,False

I was an employee there and management not only completely disregarded labor laws, but management dated and married employees, creating unfair power imbalance that is borderline exploitive.

First of all, we are not allowed to sit while we are on the clock because they “own our time,” as soon as we clock in. When we are caught sitting in the back or squatting down, the shop owner who monitors our activities through the cameras, CALL the shop and tell the shift manager (who is a family friend) to tell us to stand up and to get back to work. When there arent any customers we had to stay busy even if that means constantly wiping down surfaces and never ending organizing. Our shifts are EIGHT-NINE hours long ON OUR FEET. 

Because employees are always quitting, they are always under-staffed, forcing us to be on the schedule 5-6 days a week, pulling 50-60 hours total WITHOUT BREAKS at the risk of them firing us. Their family friend who is the manager works 6 days a week and forced to cover staffing, totaling at least 70-80 hours a week doing hard labor on his feet.

TIPS. They do not give us credit card tips. If you do visit, please give the girls (because they only hire girls) cash tips. We do not see a single cent of credit card tips. Their reasoning is that the tips help them pay us $13-16/hr. 

CULTURE. For 8-9 hours, we are forced to  STAND on our feet doing whatever work we can find. At closing time, 2-3 girls clean and close down the shop. The owners micro manage and keep a surveillance of our activities. When we are slow and seen resting, the manager would yell at us. There were times when I had to go in the bathroom to cry. And because the manager is from Jordan, he often gaslights us with his hardships in Jordan and disregarding our own experience in his establishment. The only girls that stay there for long are the girls who are dating / have dated the owners’ brother and managers. One girl ended up marrying the manager, which caused an unfair power imbalance. She would lie about me to the manager and throw fits during shifts. 

I believe they might be going through a lawsuit but in my time there, I really felt injustice and employee abuse. I had to pay rent and because I was constantly exhausted from this job I had no energy to look for other jobs. Luckily my parents took me in, but I do not wish upon my worst enemy for anyone to work in this terrible place and I really am looking forward to the day when they are either forced to treat employees fairly or when customers realize what’s going on in the back and they close down.",24,1764054413.0,sanantonio,3,0.9,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

Check the link on my pinned post on my reddit profile  
  
So I recently picked up a Hario Switch and quickly got overwhelmed by how many recipes are scattered across YouTube, Instagram, and old forum threads. To make sense of it all, I built a simple site to catalog them in one place.

It currently has a solid collection of detailed recipes, ranging from Tetsu Kasuya’s new 2025 hybrid method to daily drivers from Hoffmann and Hedrick. Since I’m from Indonesia, I also made sure to include detailed routines from our local champions who recently crushed it on the world stage which might be new/interesting to some of you here.

I tried to standardize the steps so you can clearly see the open/close times and temperatures without scrubbing through videos. Direct source links are included for verification.

It is just a personal project to help me brew better coffee, but I figured this community might find it useful as a quick reference tool.

**If you have a favorite recipe that I missed, please drop it in the comments!** I’d love to add it to the list to make this a better resource for everyone.",4,1764053851.0,JamesHoffmann,1,1.0,False

For context, I had a checkup for the first time in years 6 months ago (privately) and my dentist gave me a filling. She said afterwards that the cavity was quite deep and there may be sensitivity in this teeth afterwards (it was on my second molar). After this appointment there was indeed sensitivity around this area, but it felt as if though it was coming from my first molar. My dentist also mentioned that there is early decay that can be seen on my first molar although she cannot be sure from the x-ray, and instructed me to floss and drink less coffee and sugary drinks.

I had my routine check up yesterday on the NHS and had informed my dentist that I have sensitivity on my first molar and I also have a small hole on the top of the molar that felt like it got slightly wider (bare in mind it’s been there for ages, and my last dentist didn’t mention it as anything worrysome). She merely poked at it for a bit and said that I have a cavity in that tooth that needs filling and to book another appointment, no new x-ray or anything, and it seemed like she couldn’t wait to rush me out, the whole appointment lasted about 5mins!

Now I am so anxious about getting my tooth drilled in if my dentist can’t be 100% sure I have a cavity in that tooth, especially since it will have to be an amalgam filling on the NHS as I can’t afford a white one. I wish she had done a x-ray at least for my peace of mind, and now I’m so anxious for my next appointment as I find it hard to speak up for myself.

I had a relationship with my ex for about 5 years. We’ve endured so much with all the lemons that life has given to us - from dealing with lawsuit against fraudulent business, surviving layoffs, etc - and has been semi-living together for the past 2 years. 

I reckoned a cycle of abuse where my partner always prioritizing her friends over me. It started subtle, but become obvious over the time. There was few turning points where I was left unread and she went no contact yet updating her social media frequently. She left me on my birthday to be with her friends, even worse, took her friends to my safe space to the point I’ve been isolating myself from going for coffee, gym, etc because it can be overwhelming and prone to triggering my anxieties.

The peak was the point where I need to consume psychiatric meds and seeing therapist just to endure our relationship. I was so afraid that I am an unloveable human being, where pain felt like something I deserve and bare minimum required constant begging. 

I discovered this thread and find that I’m not alone. I’m not an anomaly in this world and to see all of you who have the courage to speak up in this forum conforming that my feelings are valid. The thoughts and endless wonders in my head were not merely a result of overthinking. It was real. My body was giving me signs that I’ve been reluctant to cater to it for so long.

Today is my birthday and I’m out of the cycle. It is hard to navigate a new world where I’m actually alone (status wise, living condition, financially, everything is reset to ground zero). But here I am, trying to see if I can turn this day one into one day, and I’m thankful for all the strangers in here who have shared their stories. 

I wouldn’t be able to have this strength without knowing someone out there can make it out of the cycle , therefore, gave me a glimpse of strength to do it too.",2,1764053284.0,emotionalabuse,0,1.0,False

1p65mzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nwi/comments/1p65mzb/nwi_winter_camping_land/,NWI Winter Camping Land?,"Howdy!

I'm looking to start a survivalist YouTube channel I want to call Practical Revolutin'.

The idea is that we aren't as self reliant as we should be and the world would be a better place if we did a good bit of Practical Revolutin' by just practicing self sufficiency. Nowish until January. I'd spend M-W overnight and head home to the wife and doggo on weekends when she's not crammed with work.

You've seen this basic channel before, You let me clear a little spot for a cabin in the woods, I work around the property (farmer, master gardener, basic animal tending, carpenter, mason, all-around handyman) completing a list of tasks in return, a little monetary compensation for you possible, but really looking for a kindred soul who wants a fun cabin in the woods when I'm done and wants to help show folk how to then apply it in their homes. A mix between knots and whittling, and solar power generators that then applies those bush skills in the home (on the weekends).

Again, because I have a wife and a dog, I'd plan to be out overnight M-W and generally head out Thursday afternoon to spend weekends with wife and doggo.

Would love to be able to bring doggo out with me, hunt on property (all licenses and regs followed), show folk how to do it right... help around the property in the meantime.

I was a high school English teacher before becoming an urban farmer before learning enough skills that it's time to go to the woods and show folk.

Each one teach one, ya know...

I'm black and liberal if that matters. Let's not act like it doesn't... but I'm looking to hunt and skin and hew logs, so it might work out?

The channel's about how to detach from the Matrix, both sides love that. That's why I picked it.

I'm happy to have the convo about what I can and can't say if you let me use your land, but hope the vibes can say enough over a cup of Joe at your favorite coffee spot.

Navy brat, Army guy, Family man, just looking for 30' x 30' on your back acre to set up a little YouTube studio on the old ways we used to all share around campfires.

DM, Comment, Question.

Hoping to make this happen as soon as responsibly possible (February's cold and I'd love to be done by then... ;)

1p65kha,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1p65kha/i_dont_know_how_to_cut_people_off_completely_how/,"I don't know how to cut people off completely. How do I stop being a ""nice guy"" who cares too much?","I feel like a recurring theme in my life so far (I'm 31) is my inability to cut people off (especially girls I like or used to like). I just couldn’t let go completely, no matter how much they hurt me or how unenthusiastic/distant they are about staying in contact with me. I'm always the one who's still trying to maintain a cordial relationship, at least until I eventually get ghosted. This slow-fading drifting apart process sometimes takes years. I’ve never blocked anyone on social media and I’ve never unfollowed anyone unless they unfollow me first (I take being unfollowed very personally, just like I took being unfriended hard on Facebook when I was growing up). Even with girls I'm no longer interested in, I still wish them happy birthday every year just to be nice perhaps because I still value (and sometimes feel nostalgic about) little moments from our shared past. Those are mostly forgettable moments to them and inconsequential in the grand scheme of things.

For example, I used to have a crush in high school on this girl called Lexi. She was the only popular girl who treated me like a person (others treated me like I was subhuman) and I will always remember playing cards with her and her friends in class on the last day of school before Christmas (the first and perhaps only time I felt belonged in high school) and the hug she gave me on the last day of high school when I asked her to sign my yearbook. I was able to reconnect with her over the holiday season last year through my sister and I realized I was no longer attracted to her. My disinterest probably hurt her feelings and we haven’t talked since early this year, yet I’m contemplating whether I should text her on Thanksgiving or Christmas to see whether she’s going home and ask her if she wants to grab coffee with me and catch up. I deleted my Facebook in college sophomore year, so she’s the only person I could contact from my high school. We weren’t even in the same crowd in high school, but I still like the idea of staying in contact with someone who has known me since I was a teenager.

Another example is my ex-girlfriend Katie. We dated for 4 years until last summer. She was my first girlfriend (I didn’t lose my virginity until I was 24 and it was with someone I wasn’t even attracted to) and the first girl with a normal coming-of-age (high school cheerleader, college sorority girl) who gave me a chance. Our relationship turned toxic toward the end (clearly wanted different things, broke up and made up several times due to codependency, my inexperience handling breakups, and my fear of being alone), yet I continue to text her and check on her since we broke up. She moved to a different city for her job (she’s in PR) and I found out recently that she got engaged to some boring 36 years old lawyer. Now I’m hoping to meet up with her for one last time and smooth things over because I most likely will never talk to her again after she gets married.

The bottom line is I've literally never voluntarily cut anyone out of my life. I just don’t know how. Not with girls I crush on or at least feel worthy of my attention. Not with family (usually my mom and sister) after they said hurtful things they couldn’t take back or ruin my relationships with girls they disapproved of. Even with random FWBs and hookups I ghosted and have no interest in dating, I would still reply to their texts months later if they reach out out of courtesy. In fact, I prefer falling out with someone due to a heated argument/confrontation than ghosting. I used to attribute this to my inexperience (normal in elementary and middle school, but bullied in high school and loner in college). I thought I would get better at cutting people off once I got more socially experienced, but that hasn't been the case.

Now I mostly attribute my clinginess to having to build a social circle from scratch after college graduation (not exactly easy to do). I’ve been on a mission to be social ever since college graduation (my parents made me miss out on a lot of things growing up and I’m still resentful about it), but it always feels like one step forward, two steps back. They say every man is an island, yet I'm terrified of solitude and desperate to connect. The fact that I’ve been working from home since covid began in March 2020 doesn’t help (I’m in IT). I like waking up every morning getting plenty of text messages, iMessages, Instagram DMs and comments. I crave the validation and the dopamine hits (I don’t smoke, vape, or do drugs. I have no vices except drinking and sex). As far as I'm concerned, I already spent too many of my best years (social peak) alone at school when everyone was having fun and it felt like torture (solitary confinement) that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. Humans are gregarious animals by nature. Socializing is what has always fueled and motivated me day in and day out; I mentally shut down/give up when I'm forced to be alone for prolonged period. I hate myself for being so sentimental and mentally weak.

I also have a tendency to overrate and draw too much meaning out of casual encounters (perhaps because I rarely get the opportunity to meet girls that pique my interest these days) and I would often go above and beyond to help people I literally just met. This has led to misunderstanding with my latest girlfriend and previously with Katie. The fact that I have a habit of going around asking for random people’s instagram (I travel a lot, mostly weekenders) and then try to ingratiate myself with them by liking their pics in hopes that they would like mine back (symbiotic relationship) doesn’t help.

For example, 4 years ago, at the height of covid omicron variant, my ex Katie and I were mostly working from home (we were began to bicker) and I was craving socialization, so I took a side gig as an Uber driver just for the hell of it using my mom’s old car. I once drove 3 sophomore college girls to a party in pouring rain and offered them a ride back. They turned me down, but I gave the last girl to get out of the car my business card just in case. She texted me months later for a 2+ hours ride home because her dbag boyfriend stood her up. It was freezing that day, but that 2 hours was one of the happiest times of my life. We played Christmas music and sang off-tune together, took selfies, and chatted throughout the drive about life, relationships, astrological signs. I didn’t charge her for the ride (I didn’t want her money). I helped her with her luggage and she gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek and wished me merry Christmas. Then I went back to my car and broke down in tears because I was so touched. Life is mostly misery and pain, but timeless moments like this (spontaneous connection/moment of kindness) is what makes life worth living imo. I thought she was an angel and my Christmas miracle/serendipity moment. Then she knocked on my window and gave me some treats her mom had baked and a sorority cooler she had made. Anyway, this was December 2021 and I still text her to wish her happy birthday and merry Christmas every year, even though she has never seemed that enthusiastic about staying in touch with me. Maybe she even finds my annual texting ritual creepy, but I’ll almost certainly reach out to her again since it’s almost that time of the year.

Exhibit B happened near the end of my relationship with Katie. I chatted up a waitress named Kaylee at a sports bar quite a ways away from where we lived and became infatuated with her. As soon as Kaylee mentioned how much she adored animals, I immediately offered her the opportunity to look after Katie’s dog when we travelled to give her a chance to make some extra money. I just love doing small favors like that with people I don’t even know well. Eventually, Katie found out about my infatuation with Kaylee and left me for good. I ended up dating Kaylee for less than 5 months, but I’m still in contact with both of them.

The 3rd and 4th instances are both quite recent. I allowed my hair stylist and her kids to stay at my parents’ cabin because she was in an abusive relationship (her husband plays fantasy sports with me, so I know them both). I also met a 18 years old waitress at a small town diner after dropping off my girlfriend at her parents’ back in August and kept in touch. We FaceTime a lot when I work (we don’t always talk, but I just like having someone around when my girlfriend is out). She still lives with her grandma and has been saving money to fix her teeth. I recently insisted on sending her 3 grand and suggested the orthodontist my sister used. My girlfriend isn’t very understanding of this at all, despite the fact that she has tons of male friends and even let one of them touch her boobs at a house party for a photo, and we’ve been living separately for almost 3 weeks now. Yet I can’t let go of her either. I’m still paying her rent and hoping to make up with her before she goes home for Thanksgiving.

The irony is I go out of my way to present myself as an insensitive tool and an aggressive go-getter (my post-college “glow-up” consisted of contact lenses, fauxhawk, ears pierced, gold chains, fake tan, and 5-day a week workout regimen). It’s a defense mechanism; I always think it’s better to be perceived as an inconsiderate loudmouthed jerk than a sensitive and mawkish weakling and simp. I just don’t want to get hurt.

TLDR: How do I cut people off without vastly shrinking my social circle? How do I stop being a busybody who cares too much and interjects myself into other people’s lives?",0,1764052972.0,AskMenAdvice,10,0.5,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )

Heres what really worked for me after I couldn't post daily

I burned myself out early in my creator journey. I kept hearing *“post every day,”* so I did… and all it did was drain me out. The problem wasn’t consistency. The problem was I had literally no system, just pressure of posting daily...

Once I switched to batching, everything GOT SO EASY. My brain finally had room to breathe, and growth became so much predictable.

Here’s the exact process I use to turn one weekend into a full month of content without feeling like my entire life revolves around filming!!

**STEP 1: STACK YOUR RAW CLIPS**  
Stop filming “posts.” Start filming themes. Treat every clip like a puzzle piece you can reuse later.  
I shoot simple stuff: setting up my camera, talking to a friend, grabbing coffee, journaling, walking around, typing, working quietly, sunlight shots, transitions, my tools.  
It all becomes reusable B-roll and storytelling footage.

**STEP 2: RECORD FOR REPURPOSING**  
Creators waste so much time hunting for the “perfect shot.” Instead, I capture motion, mood, and multiple angles so one moment can turn into ten different edits.  
I’ll film the same topic in two moods (motivational vs relatable), or shoot the same routine and narrate it with different lessons later.  
This is how pros get more out of less.

**STEP 3: WIN THE FIRST 3 SECONDS**  
If the hook fails, nothing else matters.  
These are the ones that consistently perform for me:  
• “Here’s what I wish I learned sooner about \_\_\_.”  
• “Nobody told me this when I started \_\_\_.”  
• “You’re probably making this mistake…”  
• “Watch this before you quit \_\_\_.”  
• “This simple shift changed everything for me.”  
They aren’t clickbait yk, they’re curiosity openers. *(wink ;)*

**STEP 4: BUILD CONTENT CHAINS**  
People think every post has to be a masterpiece. Nopes.  
Your content should like FEED itself.

Think of it like this:  
• 1 story + 1 lesson + 1 how-to = 3 reels  
• 1 trend + 1 reaction + 1 tip = 3 reels  
• 1 carousel + 1 reel + 1 story = 1 mini-campaign

By doing this, i managed to turn 1 weekend suddenly turns into a month of consistency.

**STEP 5: DESIGN A CREATOR DAY**  
Don’t *“find time.”* Block it.

I mean:  
Morning: shoot all B-roll  
Afternoon: script & film  
Night: edit or caption  
Next day: schedule everything, then rest

Discipline isn’t about being chained to your phone. It’s about protecting your creative bursts instead of killing them with daily pressure.

You don’t need to post more.

Heres what really worked for me after I couldn't post daily

I burned myself out early in my creator journey. I kept hearing *“post every day,”* so I did… and all it did was drain me out. The problem wasn’t consistency. The problem was I had literally no system, just pressure of posting daily...

Once I switched to batching, everything GOT SO EASY. My brain finally had room to breathe, and growth became so much predictable.

Here’s the exact process I use to turn one weekend into a full month of content without feeling like my entire life revolves around filming!!

**STEP 1: STACK YOUR RAW CLIPS**  
Stop filming “posts.” Start filming themes. Treat every clip like a puzzle piece you can reuse later.  
I shoot simple stuff: setting up my camera, talking to a friend, grabbing coffee, journaling, walking around, typing, working quietly, sunlight shots, transitions, my tools.  
It all becomes reusable B-roll and storytelling footage.

**STEP 2: RECORD FOR REPURPOSING**  
Creators waste so much time hunting for the “perfect shot.” Instead, I capture motion, mood, and multiple angles so one moment can turn into ten different edits.  
I’ll film the same topic in two moods (motivational vs relatable), or shoot the same routine and narrate it with different lessons later.  
This is how pros get more out of less.

**STEP 3: WIN THE FIRST 3 SECONDS**  
If the hook fails, nothing else matters.  
These are the ones that consistently perform for me:  
• “Here’s what I wish I learned sooner about \_\_\_.”  
• “Nobody told me this when I started \_\_\_.”  
• “You’re probably making this mistake…”  
• “Watch this before you quit \_\_\_.”  
• “This simple shift changed everything for me.”  
They aren’t clickbait yk, they’re curiosity openers. *(wink ;)*

**STEP 4: BUILD CONTENT CHAINS**  
People think every post has to be a masterpiece. Nopes.  
Your content should like FEED itself.

Think of it like this:  
• 1 story + 1 lesson + 1 how-to = 3 reels  
• 1 trend + 1 reaction + 1 tip = 3 reels  
• 1 carousel + 1 reel + 1 story = 1 mini-campaign

By doing this, i managed to turn 1 weekend suddenly turns into a month of consistency.

**STEP 5: DESIGN A CREATOR DAY**  
Don’t *“find time.”* Block it.

I mean:  
Morning: shoot all B-roll  
Afternoon: script & film  
Night: edit or caption  
Next day: schedule everything, then rest

Discipline isn’t about being chained to your phone. It’s about protecting your creative bursts instead of killing them with daily pressure.

I’ve got a friend who’s got everything. They love art, coffee, and their cars. So I thought…what better to combine all three of those things. 

I’m looking to see if someone by any chance has ran into anyone who could paint sort of a watercolor-esque image of each of the cars (Just two) on their own respective mugs. One is a truck, the other is a sports car. 

Or, somebody who does smaller scale painting who could design/paint the photos, which could then be transferred onto a mug. 

I’ve got some conceptual photos on how I’d want the cars posed/backdrop, if that would make it any easier to see the vision of what I’m trying to do 😭😭

1p65cfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ostarine/comments/1p65cfs/are_you_seeking_goal_of_life/,are you seeking goal of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1p65c8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1p65c8q/some_thoughts_on_ratio_and_water_dialing_in/,Some thoughts on ratio and water: dialing in,"May be helpful since there are so many posts on this sub on dialing in:   
  
I usually brew at a 1:16 or 1:17 ratio. Sometimes when I have difficulty dialing in a brew, I will brew at my usual ratio, but then, in a separate cup, continue to brew another 1X or 2X the weight of grounds and taste that separately. In my notes, I'll refer to this as a ""boost."" (e.g., ""Brew: 1:16 + 30g boost). I'll take notes on the ""boost"" -- if there's still some sweetness in it, I know the coffee can be pushed further. This is inspired by Elika Liftee's video with Onyx on extraction: they separate out several pours into different cups, and encourage the brewer to try each cup and taste how the flavor changes with each pour. 

But I struggle with two problems related to ratio: First, at the longer ratios of 1:16+, I find it difficult to achieve clarity and a clean mouthfeel: even if the flavor is right, the texture is bordering on muddy, and I often wish I could ratchet up the temperature to draw all the flavor out faster for a clearer cup. 

Second, I inevitably have to adjust as I drink through the bag, and the ratios get shorter in order to achieve the same flavor. At the start of the bag, I'm brewing at 1:17; but a couple weeks later, I'm finding myself stopping at 1:15, or even 1:14, to stave off the bitterness. This is almost always disappointing, because the body and intensity of a 1:14 cup is less pleasant for me. I don't want my cups to be quite ""tea like,"" but I enjoy a smoothness that I think get's lost at anything shorter than 1:16 or so. 

  
Tonight, I brewed myself a cup of Stereoscope's Ombligon Decaf. Tasting notes are raspberry, watermelon candy, and cacao nibs. I suddenly remembered all those Tetsu Kasuya videos I watched when I had my flirtation with the Hario Switch, and a comment he made: you can just get the extraction right, and then add plain hot water to the cup to stretch the ratio out. I remember thinking that made perfect sense, since I know on the rare occasion that I have an excellent americano from a cafe, what I'm tasting is exactly that: nicely extracted coffee that's watered down to spread the flavors out and smooth out the texture.

So I brewed at 1:15, then added another 2X with plain hot water. Voila - hard watermelon candy and berry notes floating on top of rich dark chocolate: my fruitiest cup yet of this bag. I feel like this is going to help me unlock different options for playing with temperature. Cheers.

**1. Introduction**

In the last few years, conversations about health and wellness have shifted dramatically. Once upon a time, people believed that problems like skin breakouts, fatigue, bloating, joint pain, or even frequent colds were unrelated issues. Today, modern science has begun to confirm what ancient healing systems like Ayurveda and naturopathy always suggested — **everything begins in the gut**.

At the center of this truth lies a structure many of us have never heard of: the **gut lining**. This thin, intelligent barrier sits inside our digestive tract and has the crucial job of protecting us. It acts like a security guard, allowing nutrients from the food we eat to pass into the bloodstream while blocking toxins, pathogens, and undigested food particles from leaking out.

A healthy gut lining is like a fortress — strong, selective, and dependable. But when the gut lining becomes weak, it develops gaps — often referred to as **“Leaky Gut Syndrome.”** These gaps allow harmful substances to escape into the bloodstream, leading to a cascade of health problems: hormonal imbalances, skin conditions, autoimmune reactions, low immunity, poor metabolism, and even chronic inflammation. In simple terms, when the gut lining leaks, your health leaks with it.

This is where **Ace Wellness** steps in. As one of Pune’s trusted wellness centers, Ace Wellness has pioneered safe and effective **Colon Cleansing therapies** to address the root of gut issues. Colon cleansing not only flushes out toxins but also rejuvenates the digestive system, giving your gut lining the chance to heal and rebuild its protective strength.

This blog will explore:

* What exactly the gut lining is and why it matters
* The key factors that damage the gut and make it “leaky”
* The wide-ranging health issues that stem from poor gut integrity
* How colon cleansing works as a natural, safe, and effective way to restore balance
* Ace Wellness’ unique approach to guiding patients toward gut-first healing

Because when your gut heals, your whole life heals.

**2. Understanding the Gut Lining**

**The Architecture of Your Gut**

Your gut isn’t just a tube for digesting food — it’s a sophisticated, living ecosystem. The gut lining, made of a single layer of cells, is equipped with “tight junctions” — microscopic gatekeepers that control what gets absorbed into your bloodstream.

When these junctions are intact, only properly digested nutrients pass through. When they’re weakened, larger molecules, toxins, and microbes slip past. That’s when the immune system panics — leading to inflammation, allergies, and disease.

**Functions of the Gut Lining**

1. **Absorption:** Helps your body take in vitamins, minerals, proteins, and fats.
2. **Defense:** Stops harmful substances from leaking into circulation.
3. **Immunity:** Houses nearly 70% of your immune system.
4. **Microbiome Support:** Provides a habitat for good bacteria that aid digestion and immunity.

**Healthy Gut vs. Damaged Gut**

* **Healthy Gut:** Smooth digestion, strong immunity, clear skin, steady energy.
* **Leaky Gut:** Bloating, fatigue, hormonal chaos, frequent illness, skin issues, brain fog.

**3. What Makes the Gut Leaky?**

**1. Poor Diet**

* Processed foods high in refined sugar, gluten, and artificial additives irritate the gut lining.
* Fried, oily foods disrupt the microbiome balance.

**2. Coffee & Tea Overuse**

Caffeine overstimulates acid production, disturbing the gut’s protective barrier. Long-term, it weakens the lining and slows healing.

**3. Alcohol & Smoking**

Alcohol strips away healthy bacteria and directly damages gut cells. Smoking worsens inflammation.

**4. Medications**

* Antibiotics wipe out healthy gut flora.
* Painkillers (NSAIDs) damage protective mucosal layers.

**5. Stress**

Chronic stress produces cortisol, which slows digestion and weakens gut walls.

**6. Toxins & Pollution**

Pesticides, plastics, and pollutants in food/water add invisible strain to the gut.

***4.***     **Signs & Symptoms of Leaky Gut** 

**Digestive issues:** bloating, gas, irregular bowel movements.

* **Hormonal imbalance:** irregular periods, mood swings, thyroid issues.
* **Skin problems:** acne, eczema, psoriasis.
* **Low immunity:** frequent infections, seasonal allergies.
* **Joint pain:** inflammation and stiffness.
* **Metabolic issues:** weight gain, sugar cravings, fatigue.

Ace Wellness sees many patients who arrive with these “mystery symptoms” — and once gut cleansing begins, they often notice improvements within weeks.

**5. The Science Behind Colon Cleansing**

Colon cleansing (colon hydrotherapy) is a safe and controlled process where warm, purified water gently flushes out toxins, gas, and waste stuck in the large intestine.

**How It Works**

* Removes impacted waste
* Balances pH
* Restores healthy bacteria
* Supports liver detoxification

**Why It Helps Gut Lining**

* Reduces inflammation by removing toxins
* Creates space for good bacteria to thrive
* Enhances nutrient absorption

**6. Colon Cleansing at Ace Wellness**

At **Ace Wellness, Pune**, colon cleansing is performed with:

* **Modern equipment** ensuring hygiene and comfort
* **Trained practitioners** with medical background
* **Personalized programs** (number of sessions, diet support, probiotics)
* **Education**: patients are guided on long-term gut care

Patients often describe feeling lighter, fresher, more energetic, and free from bloating after just 1–2 sessions.

**7. Overcoming Leaky Gut Holistically**

Healing the gut takes more than a single therapy. At Ace Wellness, colon cleansing is paired with:

* **Diet changes**: anti-inflammatory, high-fiber, probiotic-rich foods
* **Stress management**: yoga, breathing exercises
* **Hydration & sleep**: simple but powerful healing tools
* **Regular cleansing cycles**: preventive care every few months

**8. FAQs About Leaky Gut & Colon Cleansing**

**Q: Is colon cleansing safe?** Yes, at Ace Wellness it’s performed in a clinical, sterile, and supervised environment.

**Q: How often should I do it?** Typically 3–6 sessions initially, then maintenance 2–3 times a year.

**Q: Does it hurt?** No, it’s a comfortable, private procedure.

**Q: Who should avoid it?** Pregnant women, those with severe bowel diseases (Crohn’s, ulcerative colitis) — consultation required.

**Q: What results to expect?** Better digestion, clearer skin, more energy, improved immunity.

**9. Conclusion & Call to Action**

Your gut lining is the foundation of your health. When it’s strong, everything functions better — from hormones to immunity, from skin glow to energy levels. But when it’s weak, it quietly creates problems across the body.

**Colon Cleansing at Ace Wellness** offers a safe, natural way to heal your gut, eliminate toxins, and give your digestive system a fresh start. Unlike short-term fixes, this therapy supports deep healing and lasting results.

If you’re struggling with bloating, fatigue, skin issues, or low immunity, it may be your gut asking for help.  Visit **Ace Wellness, Pune** and take your first step toward healing from the inside out.

I happen to have a active one in my backyard (picture an in-ground hot tub being fed in from the hot spring) near my left neighbors house (I'll call her CN for crazy neighbor). A small stream runs through the far backyards of the neighborhood and it used for gardens and little nature areas that everyone on the street enjoys. I have my small fruit/pepper garden watered by this stream and take really good care of it. For some visualization, it has a good amount of water flowing down and everyone on the street uses it some way. My right neighbor (who's a really chill dude, who I'll call Jay) has small pools he made that are fed by the stream, and two neighbors down has a garden similar to mine. Now on to the actual story.

When I bought the house, the previous owners were sued by CN, her claiming that the land was rightfully hers. I don't know the details of her argument, but it was thrown out (as far as I know). The previous owners warned me of CN and not to engage with her family. When I moved in, CN's kids (I'd say probably 8, 9, and 10) brought over cookies and welcomed me to the neighborhood. I thought that the previous owner was exaggerating as they seemed sweet. I invited CN and her family to a small BBQ and they accepted. The second that they got in the house, CN started to explain the 'rules of the neighborhood'. I thought it was pretty normal (like to not play loud music after 9, keep your car in the driveway to keep the street uncluttered, etc. Common sense rules) until she got to some rules reguarding the stream and the hot springs.

She said that kids were allowed in all parts of the stream (in private backyards) and that everyone could use eachother's hot springs (I have the only hot spring on the street, so I was surprised by that). I interrupted her and told her that I wasn't comfortable with those, and she scoffed, saying that all neighbors were fine with it. I told her that I still wasn't comfortable with it. She ignored me, continuing with some questionable rules. The rest of the night was fine, but I felt like I wouldn't want to do it again.

I talked to some neighbors across the next couple days, who all told me to steer clear of CN and that her rules were BS. I went over to CN's house and told her that I had talked to the other neighbors and that I wasn't comfortable with anyone being in my backyard without my permission. She scoffed and said ok. I had a lunch with Jay and he told me who CN was: A serial suer with her lawyer on speed dial to get whatever she wants. CN had sued a small chain pizza place in town into debt for having peanut oil on her pizza when she was allergic to it. The pizza chain didn't even have peanut oil (and many people in the small community believed that she put it on), but still lost everything. I decided not to ever talk to her or her family.

A week later, I got home from the grocery store to see CN's kids (I'll call them EKs for entitled kids) splashing in my hot spring tub (its outside and usually has a lid on that two small kids would definitely not be able to take off as it is heavy and large). I tell them that they're not allowed in it and to leave my yard immediately, and they stand their ground, telling me that their mom (CN) told them that it was theirs and that they could use it. I told them that that's not true and to leave now. They finally do. Before you think that I'm an asshole for that, remember that pools/hot tubs are dangerous and I don't want to be liable. I headed back out to buy locks for my gates. When I got back, CN was now there, demanding why I kicked her kids out. She reminded me of the ""rules"", but I told her to leave immediately and that my security camera was recording. She cursed at me for a min or two, then left. I was bluffing as I did not have security cameras, but I did order them on amazon that night. The next day was fine, replanting a lot of my plants from my apartment's balcony into the empty garden (the one that's watered by the stream). I noticed that CN kept looking over the fence.

For the following weeks, CN complained about the trees in my yard, the color of the fence, what I'm doing with the stream, etc. Jay occasionally came over and told her to f off. Three weeks ago, I left for a couple days for a friend's wedding. I kept getting security alerts saying that there was motion in my backyard, often her kids playing in my garden (trampling my dear shishito peppers). I texted Jay to tell them to get out. If you're wondering why not call the police, they wouldn't do anything as they're just some kids. I had a suspicion that CN was telling them to do these things, but I didn't have much evidence.

On the drive back, I got a security alert that there was motion in my backyard. I didn't check as I was driving, but when I stopped for gas, I checked and saw CN instructing a plumbing team installing piping from MY hotspring into THEIR yard. I had it save all of the footage and I sent messages to Jay about it. Jay told them that they weren't allowed to be doing that, but since it wasn't his house, they didn't listen to him. I called the police and they went, but they had already installed the piping. The team was just leaving through the gate (with a broken lock on the ground), when the police showed up. They said that they had been hired by the homeowner. The police waited for me to get there while talking to the team of workers, and I told them that I was the homeowner and that I hadn't payed them to do it. They looked confused. I went with the police into the backyard and I started ripping the unsecured piping out with a crowbar.

CN starts shrieking from her yard and puts her head over the fence and starts yelling that I'm destroying private property and that she would sue me. CN then says that she has a contract with the owner of the house to have their (my) hot spring water. The police are now confused. She shows a contract that read that she was paying me $2 per month in exchange for the water. CN won't give it to me so I could look at it besides waving it around in the air. The police eventually leave and warn me not to destroy the piping. I ripped up the small pipe that connects to the source as she's telling me that she'll see me in court. I contacted my lawyer and she said that CN had no case as she didn't know my signature and it would be easy to prove it was forged. I still haven't been served by CN's lawyer, but know that I will soon. In the meantime, I've been sitting in the hot tub for long baths while talking to myself loudly about how much I love it. Petty, but it made me feel good hearing the growls from across the fence.

This is the final thing that made me post here, my garden wilting and dying at an unnatural rate. I heard a commotion out in CN's yard and I peeked over and saw her slowly pouring a massive jug of chemicals into the communal stream, which goes down to mine. I don't know if its herbicides, plant killer, or something like bleach (it doesn't smell like bleach so I don't think its that), but its rapidly killing my plants. I haven't eaten any of the fruit/peppers since as I'm worried I might get sick. I think that if I can get definitive proof of her doing it, I can maybe use it in court to prove how crazy she is. People swim in pools from the stream, so I warned Jay not too for the time being and told him to tell others. I know one neighbor removed her garden from the soil and moved it away from the stream just in case it got down to hers.

I'm unsure of what I should do next. I don't think I live in a two party consent state for video recording as it doesn't list it as one on the pdf I found. I might crosspost this into legal advice just in case (I do already have a lawyer, but it might be useful hearing free opinions from the internet).

Edit: I forgot to say that I had water testing sticks arriving tomorrow.

TLDR: Crazy neighbor steals hot spring water and pours chemicals into communal stream, poisoning my garden

Update 1: Jay offered to use a large drum in his garage to temporarily remove the water from the stream and seeing your comments, I’m taking him up on his deal. All the neighbors down the street that I’ve talked to so far (two besides Jay) agreed. One who has two sons said that they might block off the start of the stream. It is a small outlet of a moderately sized creek. It will probably be blocked off not that hard. Jay said that he can probably get the drum in place by tonight as his dad can help. Jay also has a sweet dog and definitely wants to protect it. I am going to remove my plants from the soil nearby the stream. Also, for reference in size of the stream, it’s about 1-2 feet across. Truly just a stream. There’s lots of obstacles and things that would probably filter out, but we definitely still have to be safe. I’ll update later tonight or tomorrow.

Update 2: Big news! The nice neighbors’ kids dammed up the stream at where it starts. It’s a couple pieces of wood, a branch or two, and a lot of small rocks. There’s still a tiny bit of water flowing, but it’s absorbed by the soil higher up before CN. Jay got the drum out, but we turned out not to need it. There’s water still in the pools in his backyard and we plan to do a water test. Apparently pH tests are sold in a store just 10 mins away, so I will head there as soon as I finish this post.

Update 3: Jays getting the pH test and an oxygen level test, but I don’t know how oxygen levels would play into it. I’ll look at responses and figure out what to do next. I will call authorities soon.

Update 4: The water test: pH came lower than the creek water before CN’s house (a full .9 lower). Nitrates a bit higher, Dissolved Oxygen significantly lower. That’s the only real changes in between the two tests. I wonder if she just poured a lot of vinegar. I think herbicides do change pH, but .9 is quite a bit I think.

Update 5: Big update! The makeshift dam broke and water has been flowing down, but it’s been slow. CN complained to a neighbor up the street that she’s on speaking terms with about me being a major asshole for not letting her kids use my hot spring tub. She let it slip that she poured household vinegar in the stream as “justice”. The neighbor was also shown the contract for the pipes and she said that she didn’t even have it signed by me. She and her lawyer had signed it, but without any signature space for me. I thought that she forged my signature, but she didn’t have any agreement (fraudulent or otherwise) on my side whatsoever. The neighbor similarly dislikes her, but their kids are friends, so she has to talk to CN. I sent all the info to a local environmental charity that has contacts within environmental protection agencies. They usually deal with lakes and dumping, so this was in what they deal with regularly.

The police were outside CN’s house a couple hours ago and took her to the station. CN is back at her house, now yelling over the fence profanities while I’m having a coffee. I don’t know if they arrested her and she payed bail or that she just was taken in for questioning or something. I know her brother in law works at the police station, but I wouldn’t doubt that her family members have a strained relationship with her. I hope that she’s stuck with a giant fine and/or jail time. CN’s lawyer still hasn’t served me regarding the pipes, and my lawyer is saying that CN has no case whatsoever. I’ll update as soon as anything interesting comes up.

Update 6: My power just went out in most of my house. I think CN just flipped the breakers to annoy me. Going outside ASAP

Update 7: CN indeed did flip the breakers. As far as I know, the security camera has an internal battery for some time after it’s disconnected from the power so I don’t have to worry about her doing anything.

Update 8: I called the owner of the copy/print/delivery shop and he agreed to what I said in the previous post. I removed all of the pipes from my yard and put them into bags. I didn’t have as much plastic bags and boxes as I thought so I’m paying extra for the owner of the copy shop to supply them. He just delivered the first one to CN (I watched from the street) and CN’s husband answered. He shouted for CN and she came up. I didn’t hear any of the discussion, but she signed delivery sheet, took the package (of a single small corner pipe piece), and stormed into her house. She went up to the 2nd story window and proceeded to glare at me since, still glaring as I sit on my couch while writing this. Working from home will be so nice for watching this.

Update 9: Since my last post, there has been one more pipe delivery to CN and she is pissed. She stormed over to my house (after signing the delivery which I thought she would stop doing) and banged on the door. I started recording my front door and opened the door (I'm not dumb enough to let her in). CN starts shrieking about how I'm awful and that I had to keep the pipes installed as it was her property and that we had a contract. When I told her that the contract wasn't legal at all, she starts screaming at me. I stepped inside for a second and called the police with the door closed. CN continues banging on my door. I don't open until a police car comes down the street.

I tell the police that I don't want her ever to be on my property and that she is tresspassing. They relay that to her, and she takes up a hurt old lady act (for reference, she is in her 40s). CN tells them that my hot tub burned her youngest child and that I was luring kids in. I showed the police the camera footage and they asked her to come to the station with them. I'm assuming that she made some fake report, but I guess that will be another charge of lying to a police officer. I think that the officer (not CN's brother in law) believed me and saw that she was in fact a CN.

I saw CN get back into her house and once again went up to the top window, staring. I closed the blinds. I thought she would stop (honestly it doesn't bother me), but to my surprise, she crosses the street to the side of the hill (theres a slope on the other side of the street from the houses. There's more houses up the slope) and stares through my front window. I don't have blinds for that one and was about to head to a different room when I see her trip backwards (theres a small ditch for runoff) and land on her butt. CN lets out a ungodly shriek (it wasn't that loud, but I'd like to say it was) as she storms back into her house.

I feel at this point, with all of the stuff from my lawyer, from reddit, and neighbors saying that I am completely in the right and that CN is insane has made this more into entertainment than a scary situation for me. I have multiple locks arriving in a couple days and a new security camera for the side yard. If you have any legal suggestions, please tell me. If there's anything I should be aware of, please tell me.

Update 9: I’ve been told that messing with CN is probably not going to help out legally, especially with a restraining order, so I just told the copy shop owner just to deliver it all at once. I don’t know if that’s happened yet, but I’m fine not being looking when I happens. I will file a restraining order today. I don’t know how it works, but I hope I can complete it today. No new news from CN except Jay saying that she looked really mad. I know this isn’t a big update, but it’s an update on the situation.

Update 10: This happened last night and I was too tired to update after it. CN's husband (I'll call him NH for neighbor husband) knocked on my door last night, alone. CN wasn't there, so I answered it. He then tells me that CN is ""going through some things right now"" and some other stuff. He then asks me if I could ""let sleeping dogs lie. She did some stuff wrong, but she's a really great person"". I told him that I would consider it. I'm not, but I didn't want to be in that conversation. I honestly thought that he would apologize about it, but making excuses like that is so pathetic. According to many of my neighbors, CN's been like this for years. I think he's trying to cover themselves from the bomb they just planted. That's all. New updates probably coming soon.

Update 11: I was typing this out earlier, but it didn’t save as a draft so I will paraphrase it instead of writing it all out like earlier.

I went out to get my mail and I noticed CN rush out of her house onto her porch to watch me. I take the mail and head inside. Through the endless sea of junk mail, there was a wedding invitation. Nobody I know remotely nearby is getting married and I didn’t recognize the names or the faces. On the back was a handwritten letter thanking me for volunteering my house for the bachelorette party and inviting me to wedding at a local venue.

Definitely did NOT invite anyone to use my property for a party

My backyard isn’t the biggest for a party

I don’t know who these people are

I took a picture of the front and the back and then went and made a copy of the invitation and cut it to the right size. I then took the copy and walked in front of CN’s house (in the street). She is looking from the door. I then light the copy on fire (safely). She runs out and starts yelling at me. I am not entirely listening as I had an earbud in my left ear listening to a podcast (I listen to podcasts while doing my routines and hadn’t bothered to take it out) and at one point, I heard the groom’s name. Clearly she was behind it (I knew before, this just solidified the fact). I called her husband and told him that I was not hosting the bachelorette party and to leave me alone. He asks which one. I told him the names of the bride and groom. He is audibly surprised. He then tells me that the groom is CN’s son from a teenage pregnancy (not with him). He then said that he would talk to CN about it, calling it an accident.

I find the name of the dad of the groom and call him. He sounded super genuinely grateful when I told him who I was. I asked him about CN and he said that she had left the baby with him and when he had sued for child support, the judge said that it was his poor choices that led to the baby and he was responsible for it, without child support. I told him the situation, and he sounded defeated. Apparently, the groom had been quick to forgive his absent mother (CN) and had invited her against the dad’s wishes. He said that he would tell the groom and the bride about the situation.

I then had a thought that would be the absolute perfect revenge: I offered to host the party for free with 2 rules

They don’t damage anything and clean everything up

CN is blocked at the door of the wedding despite her invitation

My invite to the wedding still stands.

He said he would discuss it with the bride and groom. Even if he says no, it’s worth a try.

I just realized I typed it all up in detail despite what I said at the beginning. I will probably get the news in the next couple days.

Update 12: This is just some clarification (it hasn't been brought up, but might as well. The wedding is happening on the 24th. I'm pretty sure the invite I got was a spare for later as I doubt they sent out invites so last minute. CN reached out to the groom when she heard about him getting married. The groom is in his 20s and had never seen his bio mom before (as far as I know).

Update 13: I will call the groom's dad GD and groom and bride G and B

I was looking over some comments just before posting this and realized I don't want to be screwed over, so I am staying back.

Also, GD gave me a call extremely late last night and told me that G wanted to meet his mom (CN) at the wedding. B was supportive, thinking it would be an extremely wholesome wedding. GD said that he would try to find another location for the party, but that it would be hard this late as B had a large bridesmaids group. GD is going to help CN with preparing for the wedding at his son's request, even though he thinks it might be a disaster.

My plants that are near the stream look scorched as if they were in a fire. (I'm talking about the plants that are next and around the stream, not in my garden.

I think the next steps are through legal means and not through petty actions.

I will keep you all updated.

Update 14: CN had been trying to gain access to the hot spring for as long as she's known of it. She had tried lawsuits, land disputes, and other legal and legally dubious means to get it. When she heard of her son becoming married, she thought that she could have a good attempt at gaining access to the hot spring. CN had initially offered to use her house for a price for the bridesmaids party, but since it didn't have anything good for a party, B had declined. She couldn't find another place though, but still didn't want CN's house. CN had then had the bright idea to tell the B and G that she had had a natural, healing, and amazing hot spring in her yard and B said yes. This is when CN tries the whole piping the hot spring to her yard. She obviously doesn't get far into that plan. After I dismantle all the piping, she volunteers my house and backyard for the party. I think that the stream pollution was lashing out because she was mad before she volunteered my house. No updates besides what I've pieced together from assorted sources.

Update 15: GD called me about 10 mins ago. I was going to post the update right away, but I was reading some of the comments. This is what he said, and asked if my offer about hosting the bridesmaids party was still standing (this is heavily paraphrased to be readable, but all the main points and events are there). GD met up with CN to talk to her about the wedding, mostly setting boundaries. He went to her house (with his phone recording just in case anything happened, knowing the history of CN). GD is talking to CN very formally, as much straight facts as possible when he glances through a cracked open door into her bedroom. I don't remember the word he used to describe it (it was a very good way to say it), but kind of out of the corner of your vision when you're avoiding eye contact. GD sees multiple white dresses laying on CN's bed. They are fancy dresses. Not quite wedding dresses, but definitely close. GD can't stop staring at it. He then asks CN about what she's wearing to the wedding, and CN says that she has a couple dresses picked out. He connects the dots and subtly leaves the conversation, calls B and G and tells them what he saw. He then gives G some of CN's history. B then asks if they can do the house with the hot spring then. GD tells me that he knows that I don't like CN and that I wouldn't be at the wedding, but that the rest of the deal would stand. I told him sure, but not to let CN know about it, just letting herself think that I got pushed around by him into hosting. I know that the agencies I contacted about her pouring vinegar into the creek have been investigating, so even though it likely wouldn't, I hope it all falls out on the day of the wedding

Update 16: I’ve been asked for an update. There has not been much crazy neighbor activity over the time that I haven’t updated. I think she installed a step stool on her side of the fence as she’s been looking evil eying me whenever I’m in the hot tub. The weddings coming up next weekend, so I’m interested in what’s going to happen. Not much has happened besides that.

Update 17: Ok, I’ve been told to skinny dip in the hot spring. I’m not doing that. I am not socially ok enough for my neighbor to see, even if it’s to get revenge. I do know some people who are.

This happened yesterday around 1, just for reference. I tell some friends who are comfortable in their own bodies that they could hang out in the hot tub and I’m not going to be there, so they could do whatever. I more asked them to do it after I gave a little bit of backstory of the neighbor. They happily agreed and they came around 1. I left for a nice long lunch when they came and I told them to call me if anything happened. I also turned off the back security camera just to not be weird. Not 30 minutes later do the COPS call me asking if I was ok with the people in my backyard. CN had called the cops for a trespassing (hypocrite) and they had arrived and talked to my friends. They had my number and they called me. I told them that I invited them over and the cops left. I didn’t get a call this time, but the police were called again for my friends “exposing themselves to children”. The police knew that they were in a private backyard, but still came and pretty much left almost immediately after (it was the same officers I think). That’s all. I don’t think I’m going to do anything until the wedding. Thank you for the astounding amounts of comments, it’s absolutely insane.

Update 18: My neighbor 2 houses down just came up to me and asked if I would allow the stream to be changed in my yard (Jay already said yes). There’s a landscaping company that’s going to be installing limestone along the creek for acid neutralization or something like that. My neighbor 2 houses down does have a garden similar to mine and I guess that’s why. Not a big update. I said yes. I hope this can prevent future acid attacks

Update 19: the wedding.

I haven’t updated in a while even though some stuff is happened just so I could save it for this giant update. I am so shocked by what happened and I guess I should have listened to some advice about being safe. Also, I phrased the update about the card wrong as the bridesmaids party was last night and the wedding is today (the ceremony just finished just a couple minutes ago and I got the news of what happened by a mutual friend who went to the wedding (I didn’t know he was a mutual friend or going to the wedding. I told him about the situation a while ago and he decided to let me know).

Friday: CN kept looking over the fence. I would have turned on sprinklers, but I don’t have any because I don’t really have grass in my backyard. Later in the day, a police car pulled into CN’s driveway and a bit after, it left. CN’s “revenge” of staring at me continued a lot more after that. I don’t understand why she wastes her time doing it. It doesn’t make me feel uncomfortable.

Saturday: Some people knocked on my door mid day asking if I could let them into the backyard to set up for the bridal party. I called GD and he said it was the right people (just to be safe). They set up some surprisingly expensive and nice decorations and furniture in the yard (not in a destructive way). People come in and out while setting up and the backyard looks amazing. CN continuously peered over the fence for a good amount of time, but I didn’t care. Around 6, B and all the bridesmaids (I’ll do M for bridesmaids) (also about 20 bridesmaids there). I stayed inside mostly, but they occasionally asked me to come out and they drunkenly thanked me. I think the Ms were very wealthy as I received a little over 3K in “tips” from them as I occasionally brought out a carton of ice cream. Well worth it I think.

More to the events of the party. CN had a campfire in her backyard around 9, but there wasn’t really any wind, so the smoke just stayed in her yard. I think she tried to smoke us out, but maybe she was just having a little fire (I doubt it though). She then gets her hose to put out the fire and “accidentally” sprays water over the fence. Eventually, once the party winds down and they’re packing up, B hands a card signed by all of them thanking me for hosting with additional tips inside (about 2K). I was honestly stunned how nice they were.

Around 11, a very drunk CN bangs on my front door as I’m about to go to sleep. I don’t answer, but have the video on the doorbell camera. She leaves after a bit and I go to bed.

This morning: this is a secondhand account, so I won’t have all the details. CN comes to the wedding in her very white dress and demands to be let in, but the security denies her. She tries to push the security, but he isn’t fazed. People were watching, but my friend who was there had to go do something (I didn’t ask what). When he gets back, CN isn’t there.

What’s happening on my side: this is my account that is right after, but before I got the news about what happened. CN bangs on my door and tries the knob. Since I was getting groceries a bit before, I had accidentally left it unlocked. She comes into my house. I call the cops as soon as I see her open my door. I run upstairs while I give the info to the cops. CN screams at me and eventually slaps me in the face. I’m screaming at her to leave and she tries to slap me again. I grab her wrist and she screams. I basically drag her out the front door right as the police arrive. She is put in the back of the cop car and the police interview me. I tell them and they leave, then I get the news.

CN is not back. I honestly won’t argue with people about if this is true or not as what happened this morning doesn’t feel real even though I just lived through it.

Update 20: This is probably the final update as I doubt any new updates will come. CN still hasn’t come back from the police station, or she’s been hiding in her house. If she hasn’t come back (which I think), I think she might have not been able to pay bail, but I have no legal knowledge really. She’s apparently facing north of 3 years in jail, but there’s a good chance she’ll get less or not at all. I grilled some food Saturday and hosted a good amount of the neighborhood. As much as I would like to say I was cool and collected after the assault, I felt a bit shaky and not great, so having some people over seemed like a good idea. I think it’s mostly worked. Last night, I went in the hot spring and it was really nice to hang out.



**Update - 6 months later**



Hi. I haven’t touched this account in a long time due to so many people following it and any of the shitposts I do I think alerting everybody. You can find what happened last spring here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/oFgxP3p7JS](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/oFgxP3p7JS) I really didn’t think I would do an update as I thought that my CN would finally stop after getting legal punishment. She so far has only with me.

One of my very nice neighbors who has the kids who volunteered to help stop the creek earlier this year is well liked throughout the neighborhood. I think I’ll call her D because I don’t want to put her name here after someone found out what city I live in. So she often helps with babysitting kids for a couple hours for a simple IOU. It’s thanksgiving break for all the kids so lots of people are going on vacation or visiting family. CN and her husband are currently in California. You may think ‘oh where are her kids’. She left all 3 of her kids at the doorstep of D with an envelope that has $50 to pay for the 2 weeks that they’re at the beach. The thing is, D and her whole family is in the Midwest for the week visiting family for Thanksgiving.

CN’s kids were out at the door for hours (presumably in the cold rain) before another neighbor noticed them and asked what they were doing. The kids said that D had agreed to have them until their parents got back, but obviously D wasn’t there. They didn’t want to call the cops as they thought it was a misunderstanding, so they brought the kids around until a newer family agreed to watch them until it was sorted out. CN isn’t responding to any attempts to reach her and nobody wants to bring the cops into it. D’s pissed and said that she won’t come back to babysit them and that there was no deal ahead of time.

I’m just an observer in this so far, so this is more of a neighbor update. Probably going to have another update or two. Any recommendations? Nobody in the neighborhood wants anyone with the government involved really, and it’s not really involving me, so I doubt my voice will be heard or taken seriously. I don’t know. Thanks

Update: Pretty big consensus I should call CPS. I think I will but not tell anyone I did. CN is not a good person. If you want to know what the full situation is, I’d look at the old post. It’s archived so I think you can still see it.

Update 2: it wasn’t me, but someone called the cops earlier and by the time I called, they said that someone was at the house already. Currently, they’re trying to contact CN and her husband, but so far no luck.



**Comments**



**alwaystiired\_**

*CPS should be called... idk if you're counting that as ""government"" but CN abandoned her kids for 2 WEEKS! It's child abandonment, plain and simple. She needs to come get her kids and if you guys can't get her to do it, I bet CPS will. They are there for the kids and to ensure their safety.*

>OOP: I’ve said that but the family that’s having them now think that it’s cruel to the kids and would break up the family. It’s their choice in the end I guess :/

*I’m a social worker. My suggestion is to call CPS. Calling CPS doesn’t mean her kids will be taken away but an investigation would presumably happen and perhaps would cause CN to be scared straight. At the very least CN would be required to attend a few classes and be checked in on for awhile. Not alerting CPS would be a HUGE mistake. And the CN can’t really spin this in her favor. Edit- you can remain anonymous when calling CPS.*

Do you work fully from home or does your company still require office days?

Sometimes I take myself on a small solo date, carry my laptop, sit somewhere quiet, sip my coffee and just work,  honestly feels good. But working from home also has its perks: peace, no traffic, more flexibility, and you can multitask your life a bit better.

Which setup do you enjoy most, and why?

\-23-second extraction, 18g in, 46.7g out.

\-Puck prep- spray dose, into grinder \[Rancilio Rocky\], wdt, distribution, tamp, shot.  
\-Body of the shot is great, nice and full, mouth feel is velvety. The crema does not immediately dissipate and is structurally sound. There is still crema 4 minutes post pull.

I occasionally pull amazing shots doing exactly the same thing with the exact same coffee. I can't explain the inconsistency I'm getting. When I've ground finer, the mouth feel and flavor have not been good, and often during the pull there's evidence of channeling, which I note due to spraying from the bottomless portafilter, which was not observed in this shot.

At the beginning of this year I graduated college and got a new job using my degree and much better pay. (like triple) However I honestly enjoyed my previous job so much better and was thinking about just picking up a couple shifts here and there just for fun. I know this sounds like a silly question but I don’t know I just wondered if anyone else has had a situation like this where it’s hard to move on from a high school/college job even though it’s probably for the better.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )
