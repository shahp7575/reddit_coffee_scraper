My block in Altadena is very tight-knit and we are completely devastated by everything that has happened, so many of our homes burned down. I am organizing a meet-up (probably on Saturday afternoon) so we can come together for hugs and tears and to share resources. 

I'm trying to find a spot that is:
- indoors (hard requirement because of air quality)
- in Pasadena or close by
- preferably some place where folks could grab a cup of coffee or snack 
- preferably with close parking, again due to air quality and accessibility 

My first thought was the cafe tables upstairs at the Whole Foods on S. Arroyo. But, right now I'm not sure if 5 people will come or if it will be more like 20. (Knowing my neighbors, likely the latter). Maybe the Wild Parrot Brewey/Rosebud Coffee space, but it might be too small.

My fiance's family and friends at the church are gossiping about me- a lot.

My fiance grew up Greek Orthodox, and we live in Greece now permanently. We are much happier here after leaving America. I am going to really put it all out here in this text, so please give me a chance.

I am going to put his frankly. I am not exactly the kind of girl who fits in at the Orthodox Church¬†*at first glance.*¬†I am an artist, with lots of tattoos.

I had a very rough life growing up, and I am from a small town in the midwest. My fianc√©'s greek church is in a big city, and the people there are an extremely wealthy community. His first girlfriend was a literal multimillionaire family.

Despite my past, I have worked very hard to distance myself from it and not become a victim of it. This meant lots of therapy eventually, but at first this meant lots of experiences and experimenting.

It doesn't look traditionally ""good"" on paper. I was in and out of college until I finally graduated late, I dont have a relationship with my mother, or most of my family. I have had bouts of being very poor due to my parents actively working against my success.

But, my determination to follow my dreams means that my life has almost been as it is incredible as it was terrible. I was in foster families in high school, but I have also lived all over the world (Honduras, spain 3x, greece) and traveled extensively (Japan, all over Europe and Central America, and the Caribbean). I have a mother who committed murder, but I also have spent afternoons at Martha Stewarts house (long ago), and partied with a Baldwin (in my 20's), and have so many fascinating and ""powerful"" close friends.

I grew up in Iowa, with a lot of dirt poor friends, but I also was sent to an elite boarding school at one point. I was r\*ped and physically and horribly abused as a child and teen, but I still am able to feel happiness every day of my life. There's so much more, but you get the picture. My life was crazy. These days I don't openly share much of this info until well into an relationship with a close friend.

**All I've ever really wanted is for my life to be quiet and have a family with lots of love**. I have met enough ""successful"" and ""poor"" people to know that all I want is to have family dinners, long phone calls, and inside jokes with safe people who I love with enough money to feel okay. I dont want all of these crazy things that happened mostly in the first 23 years of my life.

My fiance is a free spirit and I think we compliment each other very well. Everyone who isn't in the church thinks were a great match.

He and I have built the beautiful and quiet life I've always dreamed of. After extensive therapy for many years, I am really doing well. My fiance was there for a portion of that time and did support me through some true grieving processes. But I have done the same for him. We have also had to go through couples therapy because we both have some childhood trauma (his mother passed away early) that's came up in the way we were relating- but it is beyond resolved. Couples therapy has transformed us into something I didn't know was possible, a true family.

Anyways.... Now that you have the backstory, the problem is the gossip and I dont know what to do about it.

Our wedding is set for this spring, and people are asking my fiance if he is sure he wants to marry me and not marry a greek-american girl..  specifically the girl he dated when he was 18 years old. They are also spreading rumors that we are getting married for a visa and no other reason (we are already legally married lol). We are both mid 30's now. We are getting religiously married because we are ready for children.

My future BIL is asking my fiance quite frequently if he is sure about me, and we just found out flat out doesn't want us to marry. I want to cry. We are not spring chickens, and we are so happy together. If we had a baby today my fiance would be 37 when it was born.

His family has also been very cold to me over the years. His step-mother (convert) won't engage with me much at all these days which is heartbreaking over the years. At one point it was so bad that she took me out to apologize for her behavior, but then the behavior started right up again in about 2 months.

I have tried so hard. I never forget a birthday or holiday. I have bought them gifts, and invited them over for meals or out to coffee (they accepted twice in 4x in 2.5 years), and tried to be so respectful of their traditions and religion. I have even volunteered many of my free hours to help with Greek fest at the church and I have attended church with them many times, even the long services that go to 3am.

Yet, what I am getting back is ""are you sure"" from the brother. His reasoning was that one day I want to ""go to grad school and the next day I want a baby"" (why I cant do both those things is beyond me), and I am flat out ignored when I try to reach out and connect. He wont even respond to happy birthday messages. I am left out of group chats about good news.

Finally, I accepted this must be the families ""style"" of existing, and that I need to not take it so personally... but then the brother started seriously dating a greek-american and they threw her a party with the whole community the first time they met her. They have become so close to her. One day, they were showing us some photos that were in a text message, and I saw that they had all been chatting.

Ugh, this next part is embarrassing, but I paid at one point for app that tells you who has been looking at your social media profiles, and It was all these names I didn't recognize. I thought they were bots and the app was a scam, but then I showed my fiance and it was many people from his church- about 10 different women I had never met.

And then just this AM, we were told that people have been gossiping. A woman I thought was my friend started talking to the future BIL, and my fiancee best man about me.. they were saying my partner is ""stifled"" with me here in Greece. My fiance laughed at that but it really bothered me. It's incomprehensible to me as when these ""friends"" came to visit we spent a week at the beach together swimming and eating mezethes. It was so fun.

**So now what? Do I have to convert? Will I ever be accepted? All I can come back to is 1.) I am not greek. I can't do anything about that. and 2.) it's my wild past and how I present.**

I am also a spiritual person, and I feel a connection to god, but I dont advertise that. I have received a ton of pressure to convert from the older women. I didn't like the idea of converting because religious trauma was part of my upbringing. I have attended well over 10 different churches, and my mother has converted to 3 different religions in my life. I just dont want to go through the process of being baptized a christian a THIRD TIME.

I do spend my time going and praying in the churches, and god truly answers my prayers. I believe in god and I am happy with my relationship with him. Maybe one day I will convert, but it needs to be on my own terms.

sorry for the rant. I am just losing it. **TLDR: People are gossiping about me and asking my fianc√© if he'd rather marry a real greek-american.. his brother doesn't like me because I have a ""wild"" past. I am really sad.**",1,1736503476.0,OrthodoxChristianity,1,1.0,False

1hy15d0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianMen/comments/1hy15d0/going_on_a_first_date_looking_for_some/,"Going on a first date, looking for some clarifications ","I tried to get advice on some other subs, but I don't think a lot of advice from Western audiences translates well to me. 
I'd really appreciate some advice and tips as I (25M) and going to meet a girl (24M) on a first date on Saturday. We met in hinge and have been talking off the app, and it's been good, and I have a feeling that she likes me too, considering the fact that she's flirted on text too and seems genuinely interested, and we match on many things like political opinions, interests, opinions in general and religious beliefs. 
So I've got a few questions that I hope I can get answers for:
1. Is a coffee and walk (with a surprise show that I've planned) a good first date? I don't drink so a date over drinks didn't make sense imo. My plan was coffee and then we catch a show for an event and than have some dessert. 
2. Is it weird to travel with her in the metro to the mall we're heading to for the date? I proposed a cab but she said the metro will atleast not see the crazy traffic that drivers have to, but I feel taking her in the metro might be off-putting?
3. I'm going to be going out of country for a few months soon, found that recently and haven't spoken about this yet, she plans to move for some experience as well, so it's not like it's out of the picture, but how do I talk about this? 
4. And tips on dressing for the date? I suggested she wear comfy shoes to the mall, and she said she isn't wearing shoes on a first date, so the bar is high for me now. 
5. What's the consensus on some gifts? She's a potter head and I was gonna get this bracelet or some pendant(not overly expensive, like 300 rupees maybe), but my friend said that would be too much so stick to flowers. What would you say, flowers and a card(her bday was last week so)? 
6. Any tips additionally might be great, like the touch barrier, I can talk comfortably, but I hesitate to go in for the hug directly with a girl, so how should I navigate that, and in general. 
7. Also, she's smashing it in her career, and I'm still looking for a good position, so mentally that's there too

Our conversations have been amazing, I had issues with unsending and editing messages, and she called me out on it and said that hopefully she can get me comfy, so oddly in my head, the Guruji Ka, koi tumse pyaar kyun karega is running. 

Sorry for the long and repeat post but looking forward to the tips and responses .

However, i have general anxiety disorder and for almost a year I have been suffering from high anxiety due to this decision. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to have a child, I like them, but the closer I am getting to the actually trying to conceive, the scarier the whole perspective gets. 

I am afraid that I won't get through it. The main reason is that I like to spend a lot of time with myself: reading, analyzing things, dreaming about something, thinking, going for a walk alone, listening to music etc. I freaking love my solitude. I kinda live in my own secure internal world, although I have family and friends, I just manage to balance everything. Like everything is in the order in my life now even with me loving to be alone  

Without my alone time I usually feel not well. I need it to feel safety and happiness. I am really happy when I am alone doing things. 

I am terribly scared that having a kid will deprive me of having my own time. That i will become forever stuck in this never ending cycle of boring mundane duties. That I will become miserable and will start to regret this decision. 

Very often I see videos online where mothers are venting about how they almost lost themselves and any of free time because of children. They complain that they are not able to drink a cup of coffee in peace let alone read a book or doing something for themselves. Of course that only worsens my anxiety. 

Do you have the same fear? And question to parents, do you have any alone time? ",1,1736503207.0,Fencesitter,0,1.0,False
1hy14gc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/1hy14gc/going_out_for_a_first_date_any_tips/,"Going out for a first date, any tips ","I tried to get advice on some other subs, but I don't think a lot of advice from Western audiences translates well to me. 
I'd really appreciate some advice and tips as I (25M) and going to meet a girl (24M) on a first date on Saturday. We met in hinge and have been talking off the app, and it's been good, and I have a feeling that she likes me too, considering the fact that she's flirted on text too and seems genuinely interested, and we match on many things like political opinions, interests, opinions in general and religious beliefs. 

So I've got a few questions that I hope I can get answers for:

1. Is a coffee and walk (with a surprise show that I've planned) a good first date? I don't drink so a date over drinks didn't make sense imo. My plan was coffee and then we catch a show for an event and than have some dessert. 

2. Is it weird to travel with her in the metro to the mall we're heading to for the date? I proposed a cab but she said the metro will atleast not see the crazy traffic that drivers have to, but I feel taking her in the metro might be off-putting?

3. I'm going to be going out of country for a few months soon, found that recently and haven't spoken about this yet, she plans to move for some experience as well, so it's not like it's out of the picture, but how do I talk about this? 

4. And tips on dressing for the date? I suggested she wear comfy shoes to the mall, and she said she isn't wearing shoes on a first date, so the bar is high for me now. 

5. What's the consensus on some gifts? She's a potter head and I was gonna get this bracelet or some pendant(not overly expensive, like 300 rupees maybe), but my friend said that would be too much so stick to flowers. What would you say, flowers and a card(her bday was last week so)? 

6. Any tips additionally might be great, like the touch barrier, I can talk comfortably, but I hesitate to go in for the hug directly with a girl, so how should I navigate that, and in general. 
7. Also, she's smashing it in her career, and I'm still looking for a good position, so mentally that's there too

Our conversations have been amazing, I had issues with unsending and editing messages, and she called me out on it and said that hopefully she can get me comfy, so oddly in my head, the Guruji Ka, koi tumse pyaar kyun karega is running. 

Sorry for the long and repeat post but looking forward to the tips and responses .

My partner and I have been together for 7 months and living together for 2. Everything was going great until today. I ran into a friend who mentioned seeing him with another girl a few weeks ago and asked if we were still together. This made me suspicious, so I checked his iPad when I got home and found messages between him and this girl‚Äîsomeone he had a past with before we started dating.

They arranged to meet for a ""goodbye"" coffee, and one this day he met me for lunch first, then he saw her afterward. He didn‚Äôt tell her about me, he said he had an appointment first then could meet her. He insists nothing happened and they were just saying goodbye. A couple days later, she messaged him and confessed feelings for him and wished him well but he didn‚Äôt say anything back . Now I‚Äôm confused‚Äîhe kept this from me, and I don‚Äôt know if I can trust him. I‚Äôm unsure how to move forward and don‚Äôt know if I can get past this. We‚Äôve had a good relationship so far, but now I‚Äôm questioning if there‚Äôs more secrets he‚Äôs kept from me like this. 

I told him tonight I might leave and need time to figure things out. I am a few hours flight away from home, close friends and family, I moved to this area last year and have started a life here. How do I approach this and decide what to do?

TLDR; Partner went on a coffee date to say bye to a friend, he has a past with, that‚Äôs leaving the area. He hid this from me, hid me from her. She confessed feelings a few days later and he didn‚Äôt say anything back. I don‚Äôt know if I can trust him again or what to do? ",1,1736503031.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

1hy10wi,https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1hy10wi/a_caseys_employee_robbed_me_yesterday/,A Casey's employee robbed me yesterday.,"Yesterday I was on my way to therapy and went to a nearby Casey's location to get my usual medium coffee. They know me there by now because I'm there for my pre-therapy coffee so often. 
My s/o had given me his $2 winning scratcher and I had a dollar bill of my own; I essentially walked into the store with $3 cash. Remember this as it's important. Before I even go to get my coffee I cash in the winner so I have three $1 bills in my hand. The cappuccino machines were down (sad but no biggie) so I got myself a French roast instead. I go to get rung up and ask for a $3 scratcher and a $5 scratcher (for my s/o). A medium coffee is $2.14 after tax. So my total should be $10.14, right? I hand her my $3 and say ""the rest will go on my card"". But instead of just punching in that I gave her $3 in cash, she removes the coffee from the transaction and charges $8 to my card. She kept my full $3. I didn't get any change. 
For the life of me I couldn't think of why she would remove the coffee from the transaction. It was so odd to me. Then it struck me. In my years of working retail with digital register systems, cash transactions are tracked so at the end of the day when drawers are counted, the amount you count should equal the amount displayed on the EOD receipt. So it *looked* on the transaction like I got a free coffee (or didn't get one at all) and then was charged $8 for scratchers. That way it wouldn't be entered in the system that $3 were added to the cash drawer. Essentially, she made it look like I simply paid for my scratchers- so she could pocket my $3 cash. Now normally I wouldn't make a big deal of it and I'd just ask for my $0.86 change but I was in a hurry to get to therapy and didn't have time to call her out on it. 

But the truly infuriating factor is that I'm a usual there. I go there all the time. I know that nice old lady by name. So why would she do that to me?? Why on earth would she try to pocket my money??? I feel taken advantage of by someone I respected and it doesn't feel very good. Not to mention I had applied to work there. Now I don't know if I can ever trust her with my money again. 

And it may seem like I'm overreacting over $3, but it's less about the amount and more about the fact that she tried to pull one over on me. You never know who you're stealing from; they could be worse off than you. The fact that she had to do that to a USUAL?? Someone who does business with you CONSTANTLY for a whole $3??? I really hope whatever she bought with that was worth ruining a good reputation for. ",0,1736502744.0,mildlyinfuriating,3,0.5,False

Ah, the world of higher education‚Äîa place where you can master quantum mechanics and, unintentionally, the art of becoming a sugar daddy. It‚Äôs a tale as old as student loans: a well-intentioned mentor meets an ambitious intern with an eye for stability and some unconventional strategies. What follows is a modern story of mentorship with a twist‚Äîa financial one.

**The Setup: From Guiding Light to Accidental Benefactor**

Enter our protagonist, whom we‚Äôll call ‚ÄúMr. Generous.‚Äù Navigating the murky waters of alumni networking, he offered mentorship with the sincerity of a Sunday school teacher. Little did he know, his good intentions would open a Pandora‚Äôs box marked, ‚ÄúHelp me financially, and I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ reciprocate.‚Äù

It all began innocently enough‚Äîa bright-eyed student seeking advice about landing an internship. Mr. Generous thought he was helping her dodge the painful sting of rejection emails. But as their conversations progressed, a sharp turn led to discussions of financial ‚Äúsupport,‚Äù sprinkled with provocative photos and suggestive texts. What started as mentorship soon felt like a crash course in modern relationships, complete with eyebrow-raising overtures and a side of cheeky ambiguity.

**The Proposal: A Unique ‚ÄúFriendship‚Äù**

After a flurry of flirtatious exchanges and increasingly audacious suggestions, Mr. Generous found himself in a ‚Äúmutually beneficial arrangement.‚Äù Picture this: a weekly transfer to her bank account paired with dinner dates that veered into undeniably intimate territory. It was a win-win‚Äîor perhaps, a two-for-one deal‚Äîleaving both parties oddly content. For her, financial stability; for him, companionship with a twist.

It begs the question: why don‚Äôt financial advisors list ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù under innovative investment strategies? It might be time for a new professional category‚Äî‚ÄúPersonal Finance Coaches with Perks‚Äù‚Äîbut I digress.

**The Arrangement: Balancing Cash and Chemistry**

In an era where avocado toast is practically a luxury and coffee prices rival stock market fluctuations, it‚Äôs easy to see the appeal of an arrangement blending passion and pragmatism. For Mr. Generous, it wasn‚Äôt just about the weekly thrills‚Äîit also sparked existential musings: ‚ÄúAm I subsidizing her lifestyle, or investing in my own happiness?‚Äù

This modern-day parable of capitalism in its quirkiest form turned mentorship into a subscription-like service. ‚ÄúIs this love, or just an expensive recurring payment?‚Äù becomes the lingering question after each passionate encounter.

**Conclusion: A New Kind of Mentorship**

All humor aside, this story sheds light on the evolving dynamics of relationships in today‚Äôs world. Financial assistance and mentorship may unexpectedly intertwine, creating arrangements that are as unconventional as they are enlightening. Like a cactus blooming in the desert, these partnerships can flourish under the right (albeit peculiar) conditions.

(remake from the [original](https://pantremeni.com/when-mentoring-meets-financial-assistance-a-modern-tale/2025/01/) )

For those considering offering mentorship, be prepared‚Äîwhat begins as career advice over coffee might just lead to a saga of surprising benefits. In this brave new world, mentorship could come with unexpected costs‚Äîand, occasionally, unexpected rewards. Buckle up!",1,1736501922.0,Tangled_Threads,0,1.0,False

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response‚Äîor lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly‚Äîthe Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change.

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me‚Äîan eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation.

In the bustling city of Metropolis, where the rhythm of urban life played out in a cacophony of sounds, a peculiar street performer emerged. Armed with an array of unconventional instruments, he orchestrated a symphony of onomatopoeic brilliance that echoed through the crowded streets.

The narrative unfolded with the vibrant expressions of onomatopoeia, capturing the essence of the city's sonic landscape. The performer's drumming evoked the rhythmic tap-tap of raindrops, while his wind instruments mimicked the whoosh of passing cars.

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed‚Äîa pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden.

As the narrative unfurled, the absence of conjunctions served as a narrative device, intensifying the sense of urgency and desperation that permeated Emberfall.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

TL/DR: After a long-term relationship, I feel scared of letting a new person enter my life. I cannot believe that someone else may like me too. How to get over this thought?

I (25F) walked out of a really long-term relationship 7 months ago. I was brutally cheated on by my partner and it left me with severe trust issues and insecurities. Since I have not been single in the longest time, I am scared of getting into the modern dating pool. As I hear stories from my girlfriends about their dating lives, it scares the shit out of me.

A few months after the break up, I signed up on dating apps and the idea of getting to know new people and the efforts in making myself likeable, got me overwhelmed. After a few days, I realized that I was not ready for all this and I was unconsciously using other people to get over my loneliness and boredom. So, I stopped. 

A few more months passed, I was past the grieving stage and was building my life slowly one day at a time. Meanwhile, a guy I met on the app and was talking to once in a while, reached out for a coffee date. I liked the guy when we first met but we didn't live in the same town. Now that he asked me out, even after tonnes of dilemmas, I went out with him. It went pretty well. We met up few more times during his stay at the town. I thought that it would not work out once he leaves and gets busy with his own life. But...it didn't? He is putting in more efforts to get to know me. I do like this guy but I am not really sure why he is putting in the efforts. He's pretty good-looking, handsome, and charming. He can literally get anyone he wants. 

I have this constant thought in my head that, ""why would anyone like/love you?"", ""what if he has no other option and that's why he is talking to you"", ""what if I open up and he leaves me more damaged?"". Is anything broken inside me? What am I doing wrong? How do you get over these obsessive thoughts?  ",3,1736500322.0,AskIndianWomen,3,1.0,False

Hoping to fast for 25 days. Primary reason - going on a ski trip and want to ease the weight on my knees for enjoyable riding. Secondary reason - I'm too fat anyway, so have to lose about 20kg, before I can feel good naked in front of a mirror and my wife. That probably means another month of fasting after my ski trip.

I've also re-started running every other day, and MAN is it hard. Not sure if it's because of fasting or my fatness and un-fitness, but it's hard.

I'm not doing a true water fast, because the main goal is weight loss, and Extreme calorie restriction, as one might call it, works just as well. Calories in - calories out after all, amirite? I enjoy several coffees with milk and sugar, tea with honey and bullion (stock?) made from the little cubes in the evening. The last one is a gamechanger, if you're fine with a few kcal. Firstly it contains a lot of salt and is by far the easiest/tastiest way to consume it, secondly - since it's salty and savory, it has something in common with eating and really eases the hunger pangs I get when family is having dinner.  
All in all I say I consume about 100kcal over the span of a day. Some here would say that it completely negates any positive effects of fasting, but I wouldn't be sure. Considering my calorie consumption, it's less than an hour of my body's energy needs, so at worst it puts an hour long pause on the ketosis, after which it has no option but to restart, since where else the energy is gonna come from, if not fat. In reality I doubt metabolism is that binary and ketosis probably just slows down for a bit and never completely stops after a coffee with a spoonful of sugar.   
Not sure about autophagy, but I suspect it's similar, although I'm nov sure and don't currently care much either way.

So far feeling great, except the damn cold. I've never been the kind of person that is cold often, but damn it, I'm now cold all the time, which is hard, because it's winter outside and my warmest jacket is no longer warm enough for me.",3,1736500085.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

All I knew from that point forward was police and social workers.

We had contact 6 times a year, and I saw her and my sisters (now 24f, 27f and 17f) often until I  was 13 and my foster mother passed due to years of alcohol abuse. Both my foster mother and father were alcoholics, and my foster father was fairly abusive to both of us during my childhood.

When my foster mother died I wrote a letter to my biological mother and the courts saying I felt like I needed to be with my foster family to grieve, and my mother basically vanished from my life from that point forward. I attempted to reach out and build a relationship for years after this point, to no real avail.

I‚Äôm still close with my sister (24f) and visit her as often as I can, and a few times my mother has come while I‚Äôm there and basically ignored my existence, and any contact we have had has been mostly just‚Ä¶ civil.

# Who is this for?

* Engagement ring shoppers exploring diamond options

Cons:

* Not all shapes offer equal brilliance
* Some fancy shapes may be more prone to chipping
* Pricing can vary significantly between shapes

# Smart Buying Recommendations

1. Consider your lifestyle when choosing a shape. Active individuals might prefer shapes with fewer pointed edges.
2. Compare similar carat weights across different shapes to see which offers the best visual impact for your budget.
3. For elongated shapes like oval or marquise, pay attention to the length-to-width ratio to ensure pleasing proportions.

1. If choosing a step-cut like emerald or Asscher, prioritize higher clarity grades as these shapes tend to show inclusions more readily.
2. Look at the diamond in different lighting conditions to ensure you're happy with its appearance in various settings.

# FAQ

Q: Which diamond shape looks biggest for its carat weight?

A: Oval, marquise, and pear shapes often appear larger due to their elongated form.

Q: Are some shapes more expensive than others?

A: Yes, round brilliants typically command the highest prices. Princess and cushion cuts often offer better value.

Q: How does shape affect a diamond's sparkle?

A: Round brilliants are engineered for maximum light return. Other shapes like princess and cushion can also offer excellent brilliance, while step cuts like emerald provide a different, more subtle flash.

Q: Can diamond shape affect durability?

A: Shapes with pointed corners (like princess or pear) may be more prone to chipping and require protective settings.

Remember, choosing a diamond shape is a personal decision. Take your time, explore options, and select the shape that speaks to you and fits your lifestyle.

Personally, I think skoth sounds better.

I might go with a female in a hoodie or tracksuit holding a Styrofoam cup of coffee, I think her name is going to be Cindy.

Keep the brown fur and front claws from the sloth, give it the tail, stripe and maybe the back paws of the skunk as for the face might have to find the best aspects of both animals and combine them.

The background for the skoth piece is kinda obvious, but since she's holding a Styrofoam coffee cup, she's in a coffeeshop.

As for the colour of her hoodie/tracksuit, I was going to go with purple but thought that might stand out too much, and she's already unique enough, so I thought grey would suit her better as she doesn't want too much attention drawn to her, as for her eyes either blue or green, blue is my favourite colour but I might prefer green for her.

I was mulling over the idea of giving her heterochromic eyes, right eye blue, and left eye green. However, she's already unique enough.

I did think about having her jumper sweatshirt being a zip up and being open and showing her purple t-shirt with the slogan: ""Life stinks, I need a nap""

Well, I am going to share about a bad day, too, because it was so utterly ridiculous it was almost laughable and will hopefully make you feel less alone if you feel like this, too.

* Woke up, had an early meeting. Light sensitivity during the meeting was brutal and my eyes teared up the whole time. Wrapped up and Immediately went back to sleep.
* 2 hours later-- tried to wake up again. Tried to stand, could not, got very tired, laid down, back to sleep.
* For the daylight hours-- continued to try to wake up and get up, and every time would have false starts; would immediately feel lightheaded, then hit by crushing fatigue, then lay down, and fall back asleep. Got some emails sent in the meantime, but largely felt like I was navigating some heavy fog.
* Felt myself perking up, decided it was time to try to eat a meal, immediately got tired and went back to sleep.
* In the evening, drank a coffee, it did nothing. Drank two cold brew concentrates, it did something. Got enough steam to get my needed work tasks done from bed-- but the tradeoff was a massive headache and stabbing back pain.
* The two cold brew concentrates pretty much wore off and now I am exhausted again.

  
So I basically spent 70% of the day sleeping, 10% of the day trying to wake up, and 20% of the day doing what I actually needed to do. Good stuff! ",2,1736498269.0,Lyme,0,1.0,False
1hxzzsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hxzzsr/life_is_turning_out_for_the_worse_and_i_feel_alone/,Life is turning out for the worse and I feel alone..,"I've always dealt with negative self-image. I know that. I know I don't let myself see the good in me, I know I just won't accept the fact I'm good at a few things that make me special. Piano, sure.. Art, okay. I enjoy them, I love them more than anything. Video games too. But I'm at a point in my life, where I don't have the energy to do any of that. I haven't touched Ibis Paint X since June. I'm a little more active in music, but that still takes so much energy and it feels exhausting sometimes.. 


What's more exhausting is my family. They're non stop fighting.. And I know I'm an adult, I'm 21 years old, I just came back to my hometown to spend the holidays. But it's been nonstop fighting and yelling.. and yelling and screaming at each other. They're falling out of love. My grandma, aka my dad's mother, has Alzheimer's. It's pretty rough living with her sometimes, but we'd never turn our back on her. I know she feels trapped here with us, but we can't just leave her to fend for herself in a village nobody visits anymore. Barely ten people live there. She can't take care of herself. My dad's side of the family doesn't want nothing to do with grandma. Her own daughter never cared to say ""bring her to me for a day or two"". We haven't had any family outing for a coffee for a whole year now. And my aunt is properly living her best life, even shoving it into our faces.


My father can't bring himself to hate her. But we do. I despise her. Her whole family, even. And for that exact reason, my parents constantly have fights with each other. Day and night, I can't take it anymore.. I came here to relax for Christmas and New Year's, but all I did was fall into depression again. I've been getting these impostor syndrome-esque feelings.. Like anything good that happens to me has no use and it will all crumble again. And that's what's happening.. I'm dying inside. I thought I was over this depression cause by an emotionally abusive friendship, but it's all coming back.. I can't take this anymore. Nobody understands. Not my parents, nobody. But what they do know is that they have an overly sensitive daughter. I can't help myself for feeling too deeply and hurting for others. If my mother cries, it breaks me. If my father starts talking sarcastically, I can't listen. If someone else hurts, I hurt too. My parents know what I've been through from my 12 to 19 years of age. And yet, they still choose to say I have all my problems solved..


I don't want to be sad all the time, I'm tired of crying for others and feeling sorry for myself. I've been a people pleaser my entire life, always putting everyone above my mental health and being. I'll be selfish this time and go back to my uni town. I'll stay there for a whole week to just be by myself. I don't deserve this. It's time to take care of myself for once and let the middle aged people handle themselves.

I don't know much about immigration but I'm the one that's doing the paper work for our change of status. With the help of USCIS official website, I managed to get the papers that's needed but here's the problem.

1st the guy just recently got fired from his work causing trouble in our financial needs like gas, internet,and house bills. Luckily my mom has friends that's willing to help us out by doing house chores for them.

2nd this guy now wants the cash for his personal needs like for his cellphone. We understand that he needs money right now, so almost all of the money is given to him but he still wants more.. take note we also need to feed ourselves and make sure we have enough money for applying for change of status..

3rd And now he threatened us that he'll deport us if my mom won't fix their relationship. (Take note, after my mom's 'work', she goes straight home to him so she can fix their relationship, sacrificing seeing her children and even her rest days. Also me and my sister ain't living at his home anymore, ever since he locked my mom out of the room because he didn't get what he wanted and made my mom sleep outside of their room that caused a police to come over.. we are now living under an Aunt which is my mom's friend)

Ever since we got here, He made it like living in H*ll because of his random outbursts like leaving my mom at Las vegas all alone without any ways of getting back home, arguing Infront of strangers that's doing their jobs; making us feel so humiliated to be with him, throwing coffee at my mom, chocking my mom while she is sick in bed because they got in an argument, accusing her of cheating when she's busy all day providing for us.. and many more. 

What should I do? Can he really deport us? Does he have authority to do so? And can we still apply for the change of status? 

Ps. My mom and this guy has been in a relationship for 6yrs and it was all Ldr. We got here through legal procedure because he was the one to petitioned us to get here. Our immigration status was K1 and K2 (Fiancee visa). We got here in April 3 2024 and they married in June 8 2024.",0,1736497987.0,immigration,17,0.14,False

1hxzqe0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1hxzqe0/decreased_fetal_movement/,Decreased fetal movement,"30 weeks today and from this morning to 9:30 at night she was having a VERY quiet day. She normally rolls around at breakfast and really gives me a few good kicks with coffee proceeded by 3 decent wake windows that I can feel no matter what I'm doing despite my anterior placenta. Today was not that day and it was very strange after having 3 consistent weeks of this ""schedule."" Long story short I went in to L&D...hesitantly. I didn't want to use up medical resources if she was fine. Welp, she was fine, she was great actually! She must have changed positions because we could hear her rustling around in there for the full 30 min....it was beautiful. The nurses made me feel so welcome and reassured myself and my partner that this is what they are here for, to make sure babies and mama's are safe.

So if you are contemplating getting checked out because you're uneasy, this is your sign, do it! ",42,1736496796.0,pregnant,13,0.98,False
