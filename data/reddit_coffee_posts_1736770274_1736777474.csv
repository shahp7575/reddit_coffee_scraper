1i0enbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1i0enbq/one_day_in_paris_review/,One day in Paris (Review),"Bonjour! I can happily say I've been to Paris. Thank you for all your help during my planning process!

**The trip and my hotel:** I arrived at Paris CDG at around 10 a.m., a short flight from Frankfurt. I traveled with Air France. I stayed in the Paris France Hotel (Marais), simple but comfortable. 

**Notre Dame**: Since I didn't get an appointment to enter, I thought I would not see it. Nevertheless, I realized the line was moving and after 25 minutes or so, I was inside. The Cathedral is beautiful and I admit I was moved when the sun shone through the glass and the colors ""stained"" the walls. I'm glad I stood in line!

**Catacombs of Paris**: I booked this one week in advance, which is the earliest it can be done. I'd always wanted to visit the catacombs and the audio guide was a welcome plus. For me, the history behind them and how they seemed to never end, was the most interesting part. They're worth the visit, IMO.

**Seine cruise**: After some recommendations here, I booked with *Vedettes du Pont Neuf* and enjoyed the cruise. Our guide spoke French and English, and I could understand everything she said. The sunset on the way back was beautiful!

**Other sights**: I wanted to see the Eiffel Tower, the Arc, the Louvre, and the Pont Alexandre III, so I decided to walk all the way from Notre Dame instead of taking the Metro for everything. In total, I walked 20 km that day, and although this was not necessary, it was a beautiful sunny day and I enjoyed being outside.

**Food**: After some walking, I stopped at *Merci Jérôme Pont-Neuf*. I had an espresso and a croissant with almonds. What I loved the most was the service! For dinner, I took a recommendation from [the David Lebovitz site](https://www.davidlebovitz.com/paris/) and ate at *L'Apibo* (31 Rue Tiquetonne). The pork confit was delicious and they had an excellent service! The next day I had a croissant, a black coffee, and orange juice in *La Favorite Turbigo*, since it was just in front of my hotel.

**Transportation**: I only stayed a day, so I just bought physical tickets whenever I needed them. The metro was quick and convenient. 

**Experiences with locals:** Sadly, I don't speak French, but I learned how to communicate this in French, and how to greet people, say please, thank you, etc. I didn't have any problems during my trip. On the contrary, when I asked for help, I received it with a smile every single time.

Overall, I'm quite happy I did this (and on my own!). I saw everything I wanted and more, and came back home in love with the city. Next time, hopefully sometime this year, I would like to go back and take an off-the-path tour with my husband, but until then, I have something to dream of!",3,1736777013.0,ParisTravelGuide,0,1.0,False

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop. So click on one of the links above so you can get your very own copy of “MomPreneurs”, a very serious well thought out business guide for moms.*  ",1,1736776949.0,OOALMarketing,0,1.0,False

1i0els2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i0els2/every_time_i_leave_i_end_up_back_at_this_diner/,"Every Time I Leave, I End Up Back at This Diner","The fluorescent buzz was the first thing Evan noticed. A sharp, grating hum that seemed to drill into his skull. He squinted at the harsh lights of the diner’s neon sign, blinking sluggishly in the haze of the desert night.  

He didn’t remember pulling off the highway.  

Inside, the place was unnervingly pristine. The linoleum floor gleamed under the fluorescent lights, and the air smelled faintly of burnt coffee and lemon cleaner. A few patrons sat scattered in booths, silent and motionless.  

The waitress appeared almost immediately. She was tall and thin, with a crisp uniform and a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes.  

“Welcome, hon,” she said, sliding a menu onto the counter. “Coffee?”  

“Uh… sure. Thanks,” Evan muttered, sitting down.  

The coffee arrived too quickly, steaming and black. Evan stared at the rippling surface, his reflection distorted and fragmented. He felt a gnawing unease but couldn’t put his finger on why.  

“You look like you’ve been driving a while,” the waitress said, leaning on the counter.  

“Yeah,” Evan replied, though he couldn’t remember how long he’d been driving or where he was headed.  

“Well, you’re here now.” Her smile stretched wider, her teeth too white against her red lipstick.  

Evan picked up the coffee but didn’t drink it. His eyes drifted to the other patrons. They sat unnervingly still, faces slack, their food untouched. One man’s hand trembled slightly, but his gaze remained fixed on the window.  

The waitress noticed him staring. “Don’t mind them,” she said. “They’re just passing through, like you.”  

“Passing through where?”  

Her smile faltered for a fraction of a second. “Drink your coffee, hon. It’ll make more sense.”  

Evan pushed the cup away and stood abruptly. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he shouldn’t be here, that something was horribly wrong.  

He stepped outside, the night air chilling his skin. His car sat alone in the parking lot, its headlights faint in the darkness. The highway stretched endlessly in both directions.  

As he drove, the unease didn’t fade. He glanced at the clock on his dashboard, but it was frozen at 12:00. His phone, too, refused to turn on. The silence of the road pressed against him like a weight.  

Then, after what felt like hours, a flicker of light appeared in the distance.  

“No,” he whispered, his knuckles white on the steering wheel.  

The diner’s neon sign came into view, buzzing faintly. He slammed on the brakes and stared, his chest tightening. The parking lot was identical, even down to the faintly glowing cigarette butt on the ground.  

Against his better judgment, he went back inside.  

The waitress was waiting at the counter. “Back so soon?”  

Evan stumbled in, heart pounding. “What is this? What’s happening to me?”  

She didn’t answer, just poured another cup of coffee and slid it toward him.  

“You’ll feel better if you drink it,” she said, her voice oddly soothing.  

Evan backed away, shaking his head. He turned to the other patrons, hoping for answers, but they wouldn’t meet his eyes. One of them—a woman in a faded sundress—slowly turned toward him. Her lips moved, forming words, but no sound came out.  

Evan bolted for the door, bursting into the night. He drove again, faster this time, pushing the car to its limit. The landscape blurred, the road stretching endlessly.  

When the diner appeared a third time, he didn’t stop.  

He veered off the road, tearing through the desert brush, but no matter where he went, the diner’s neon glow loomed on the horizon. His hands shook as the car sputtered to a halt.  

He screamed, slamming his fists against the steering wheel.  

As he sat there, the waitress’s voice echoed in his mind: *“You’ll feel better if you drink it.”*  

Exhausted and defeated, he stumbled back into the diner.  

This time, the patrons were gone. The clock on the wall was spinning wildly, its hands a blur. The waitress stood at the counter, her smile eerily calm.  

“What do you want from me?” Evan demanded.  

“It’s not about what *I* want, hon,” she said. “It’s about what *you* need to remember.”  

Evan’s breath hitched. “Remember… what?”  

The fluorescent lights flickered, and suddenly he wasn’t in the diner anymore.  

He was back on the highway, headlights rushing toward him. The sound of screeching tires and twisting metal filled the air. He felt the impact, the sharp pain, and then… nothing.  

The memory hit him like a punch to the gut. He staggered back, clutching the counter for support. “I died,” he whispered.  

The waitress nodded, her smile fading into something almost sympathetic. “You did.”  

“Then why am I here?”  

Her eyes softened, and for the first time, she looked tired. “Because you can’t let go. Until you do, this is where you’ll stay.”  

Evan slumped into the nearest stool, his head in his hands. The truth was crushing, suffocating. He looked up, and the clock on the wall had stopped. Midnight.  

Outside, the neon sign flickered again, the letters rearranging themselves into two mocking words:

Our current pros:



* Small, quiet town that's busier in the summer appeals to us. We currently live in Kingston but we moved from a small town in 2020 and we're missing the quiet, minimal traffic lifestyle.



* Everything is walkable. We currently live in West Park in Kingston and most errands are a 10-15 minute car ride. It seems super appealing that we could walk out our front door and be downtown or at the beach within a 10-15 minute walk (likely less with the neighborhood we're targeting). 



* Lower cost of living. We can get a much nicer home with more space which would be helpful when we eventually have kids.




* Would be nice for our future children to be able to walk to school, walk to their friends house after school, bike to the beach or around town, etc. We both had similar childhoods where we could just be outside walking / biking around town with our friends and we'd love for our children to have the same opportunity (not that you can't do this in Kingston, but it may be a bit more challenging?).



* More immediate access to nature / water / provincial parks. 




* Commute is actually shorter for my wife (>~30 minutes from West Park to CFB lately with traffic + construction, only ~20-25 max from Gan). I work from home so my commute (kitchen to office) would be unchanged. 





We're really romanticizing the lifestyle of being able to walk out our front door and grab a coffee downtown, be outside more, and engage in a smaller community. What are the downsides / negatives we're not considering?",2,1736776706.0,KingstonOntario,1,1.0,False

She was this vibrant, headstrong girl who could turn heads wherever she went. We met at a café in Koramangala—her arguing with the barista over how her cold brew wasn’t cold enough, and me awkwardly waiting for my filter coffee. She turned around, caught me laughing, and just like that, we started talking.

Bangalore became our city. Lazy afternoons at Cubbon Park, long walks around Ulsoor Lake, late-night drives on the ORR while we blasted old Kannada songs she loved. She’d drag me to quirky places like the flea markets in Indiranagar, or insist we try every dosa joint on Church Street. Life felt full, and I was convinced I’d found my person.

But then things started changing. She stopped making time for our weekend plans—always ‘busy’ with her new project or hanging out with her office friends. She’d text less, and when she did, it felt mechanical, like she was just going through the motions.

One evening, we were supposed to meet at our favorite rooftop spot in Indiranagar, the one where we’d spent countless evenings talking about everything and nothing. She showed up late, barely touched her food, and finally said, ‘I don’t think we’re working anymore.’ Just like that. No big fight, no explanation I could hold on to—just a few lines about how she needed space, how she wasn’t ready for something this serious.

I was shattered but didn’t push her. I walked around MG Road that night, retracing the steps of one of our first dates, feeling like an idiot. Then, a week later, I saw her Instagram story. She was out at a pub in HSR, sitting way too close to this guy she’d once called her ‘office buddy.’

That’s when it hit me. All those late nights she spent 'working' and the plans she canceled—she was already moving on while I was still trying to figure out how to hold on.

I won’t lie—it stung. Bangalore felt smaller, suffocating, like every corner held some memory of her. But then I decided to take the city back for myself. I started running at Lalbagh in the mornings, trying out new cafés alone, rediscovering the parts of this place I’d ignored while I was busy chasing her.

It still hurts sometimes, but I’m learning to let go. Because maybe some people aren’t meant to stay—they’re just a chapter in your story, not the whole book.""

There are tons of posts that cover the basics of booking and planning, so I'm just going to make a bulleted list recapping some more specifics:

W Trek:

* Book early: I did this in a group of 6 friends. We planned the trip back in July/August for over Christmas, and campsites were already booked. My partner and I did the trip self supported, except we had to purchase one premium campsite due to regular campsites selling out.
* Pack cold medicine and foot care: My partner and I both caught the flu (I think) and I got some pretty rough blisters that made hiking hard. I wish I had a good decongestant in addition to Tylenol and more blister bandages. Being sick made hiking with our heavy packs very difficult.
* If you wear sports bras: I packed 2 and wish I had 3. I also wish mine were more quick drying.
* Things I brought that I was really happy with: electrolyte tablets, Clif Bars from the US, handkerchiefs, a sun shirt, trekking poles, rain cover for my pack, extra carabiners, quick dry hiking shorts.
* We booked a Kayak trip with Bigfoot that was cancelled. All the trips the day before and on the day we booked our trip for were cancelled. The following morning the early trip went out, but it seemed likely that the late morning trip would be cancelled. We were refunded, of course, but prepare for the trip to be potentially cancelled. Mini trekking is not cancelled as frequently. 

El Chaltén:

* We started our hikes pretty early to escape horse flies and heat. They did not check our passes as we were going in before 7:30. Campsites require payment now, and this money goes directly to the campsite, so if you want to support the parks, paying the fee here is helpful.
* I camped at Poincenot. I read a lot about how this campground was gross, but I did not find it too bad. They just built two new toilets at the campsite that are compost toilets, not pits, and they are much nicer than the pretty nasty green pit toilets.
* Caracaras frequent Poincenot and dig through your trash/food left on the ground. We didn't have issues with our food hung up in a tree, but I saw some caracaras in the morning destroying things people left on the ground. Hang or secure your food inside your tent to be safe.
* There's plenty of rock climbing accessible from town. I rented climbing gear at Patagonia Hikes.
* I spent 5-6 days here and was glad to stretch my time so I could account for changes in weather.

El Bolsón

* I took a bus from Bariloche to Bolsón and back. This may be obvious, but make sure your bus tickets leave from the main terminals unless you have good reason to book a bus from the side of the road.
* In Bolsón, busses are cash only and don't use SUBE. However, they were reliable and easy to find. We took busses to get from town center to Lago Puelo and Wharton.
* A popular trek to do here is El Cajón de Azul. This trek starts in the nearby town of Wharton. A bus goes directly there from Bolsón and only runs a few times a day. We took a taxi from our hostel in the morning for ease to start early, and then took the bus home in the evening from the trail head. It was $4200 a person one way. The trek itself is 10 miles/16 km round trip and mostly flat, but the beginning section is a multi-use path shared with jeeps and horses. Prepare to wait to cross the bridges as they have weight limits and lines to cross them can get backed up.
* I enjoyed Jauja and Beermania in town :)

San Carlos de Bariloche

* Compared to the other places I visited, Bariloche felt like a huge city. There is traffic, a SUBE card shortage, and the busses run less frequently than perhaps is needed during peak travel months.

If you have questions about any of these places, let me know. I tried to travel pretty cheaply but splurged on flights from Chaltén to Bariloche and Bariloche to BA to avoid extremely long bus rides.",2,1736776535.0,Patagonia,0,1.0,False

Look, if god saved your life, fantastic, if AA made your life better, great. But when it just becomes people sucking off the program, what a great program, it just feels annoying.

Today was just like any other day of my life. I woke up late to the sound of my alarm clock, being able to wake up for my medication on time somehow made me feel a bit good about myself. I made myself an ice coffee, took a sip and felt the warm through me, even more than the sun that was shining through my window.

I spent more time in my bed by scrolling through my phone. The guilt of wasting such a nice afternoon pushed me to get up and join a conversation group for language learners. Speakers in the group who are probably half my age amazed me with their high level of fluency and confidence. But it also made me so insecure of my skills and lack of personality.

Later, I tried studying but my insecurity didn't let me and before I knew it, I was already asleep. I used to stress about how much time I loss whenever I fall asleep unintentionally but recently it has been the only thing that has cleared my head a bit.

I woke up to a message from my sister asking how I've been.  It's always comforting to know that I have someone I can count on yet pressuring at the same time because I felt like I wouldn't be able to repay her. 

As the evening rolled around, I decided to write this entry. It's just me and my thoughts again. Looking back, today was just my usual day -being in calm and in storm at the same time.

Qaed Al Fursan: A ripe pineapple bomb. So good. Feel like drinking it straight from the bottle. Moderate projection and longevity. Also great for layering. 9/10

Or how final is ""never""? (Sorry, long winded, have a lot to get out today)","I have taken my first steps on this journey and I'm already getting cold feet.  I'm 40 years old dad, happily married, and ~400lbs at the moment, but I guess I could be in worse health.  Nobody has told me ""do this or you're going to die"", it's always been more ""hey lets work on your weight"".  My insurance won't cover weight loss meds, but they do cover bariatric surgery.  My bloodwork is always great (IE, no cholesterol or blood sugar issues), I sleep well enough (supposed to be on a CPAP but I despise it.. I know, I should probably come to terms with it at some point).  But I gotta lose this weight.  I don't even know how I got here, frankly.  I don't feel like I eat any more than anyone else.  I don't drink sugary sodas, and I might have 1-3 Coke Zeros a week.  I don't put sugar in my coffee.  I don't drink alcohol at home, and might drink more than a beer or so 3-5 times a year with friends.  I don't snack between meals really.  I have a bit of a sweet tooth so I just don't keep that kind of stuff in the house, so its not like I'm downing a sleeve of Oreos every night.  Sometimes I don't even eat lunch.  I walk thousands of steps a day at work, I take the stairs, I roughhouse with my daughter at home.  I don't understand why I keep putting on weight.

A couple things of note - I sincerely don't have a gym near me that is both affordable for me and fits my schedule at the moment.  I have a really bad shoulder from an old injury that I didn't get proper care for, so weight lifting isn't really an option.  I can do cardio around my neighborhood I guess, but I live in NC, so right now in the winter its absurdly cold, and during the summer its going to be oppressively hot.

I got the referral, spoke to a surgeon, I did the first required online nutrition course, and holy shit - I didn't realize how much I'd have to give up.  I guess it makes sense in a way, but can you really never have another carbonated drink?  I live on Bubly seltzer water.  So.. no more?  I can never have another Coke Zero?  Never have another beer with my dad or with my buddies?  That feels so.. final.The course cut out so much pork, too.. I love a Bojangles sausage, egg, & cheese biscuit and it seems like that will have to be a thing of the past..  It even said no pepperoni.  I can't have another slice of pepperoni pizza?  Ever?  I find myself wrestling with the cost..  I might live an extra 40 years, but if I can't eat what I enjoy then is it worth it?  Hell, can I even have cake at my daughter's birthdays?

I guess in my mind I thought ""oh they make your stomach smaller so you just can't eat as much"" and I'd naturally just eat the same things, just not as much of them, and that way I'd lose weight..  It's not that at all, is it?  What do I do?  I have to take another nutrition course this week, but this one is in person, and after that I have a psychiatric evaluation and if I'm honest with them, I don't think I'll pass..",2,1736776188.0,BariatricSurgery,0,1.0,False

I noticed the change in motivation and intensity and frankly just interest in the summer -about three months before I turned 47. (Also when the hot flashes started at night) 

I physically can’t be working like I used to. The long days are just impossible. So I work 9-5 and I skip all the networking events after 5 that are standard in my field. In my field, the networking events in the evenings are a big part of the career. I don’t even do the lunches and coffees anymore during the day. It’s too exhausting mentally and physically to uber around town for anything beyond the core pitches and meetings that I have to attend. 

The concentration required is too much for me. The amount of energy required to produce something is too much to handle. 

I’ve been anxious to the point of insomnia and not being able to eat anything over stuff at work that used to just be regular tasks that could never phase me. 

I’m at the point where I’m on a PIP. So I’m looking for a new job but I’m not really sure what to try for because if I make a lateral move I’m going to fail at it.

I woke up groggy and not very well rested, but decided to get out of bed and watch some netflix on the couch. After pretty easily staying awake through an episode or 2, I realized I hadn't had my meds or any coffee yet. Took my meds while I was making coffee, started drinking a cup, then fell asleep hard during the next episode and slept for another hour... as if I had taken a sedative instead of a stimulant. 

It's pretty common knowledge that ADHDers often have sleeping issues, but it's also common for many of us to drink a cup of coffee or take our stimulant medications and then fall asleep. Sometimes it feels like there's nothing we can really do to feel more awake. Truly seems like a miracle that any of us actually make it through the day.",1,1736774797.0,ADHD,2,1.0,False

Here's the core concept:

The Problem:
- People often treat coffee as just a caffeine delivery system
- Daily rituals have become rushed and mindless
- Coffee lovers want more than just beans in a bag
- Current coffee brands don't engage with how people actually experience their coffee moments

Our Solution:
- Premium coffee paired with curated music experiences
- Each coffee blend comes with its own musical identity
- Focus on making brewing and drinking coffee a moment to look forward to
- Guided by a fun, laid-back mascot who encourages people to slow down

Target Market:
- Coffee enthusiasts aged 25-40
- Music lovers who appreciate quality in their daily rituals
- Urban professionals looking for mindful moments in their day
- People who see coffee as more than just caffeine

Current Stage:
- Concept and branding developed
- Initial product line planned
- Building community interest

Questions:
1. Would you pay a premium for coffee that offers this kind of enhanced experience?
2. What would make this truly valuable to you as a coffee drinker?
3. How important is the music aspect compared to the coffee quality?
4. What would make you choose this over your current coffee brand?
5. How much would you expect to pay for this experience?

Any feedback, concerns, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. We're especially interested in hearing what would make this a must-try product for you.

This is a post to advertise a community based in Copenhagen :) You might have seen similar posts on this subreddit from myself, about this same group - some of you have even contacted me to join it.



We are a group of friends brought together by reddit when I made a post looking for friends back in September 2021. I'm a 27yo french women, I work as a biomedical engineer and moved to Cph three years ago ; I had just moved in and was looking for friends in here :) I met a lot of people and we decided to make a discord server. The server grew a lot, and we decided to close it for a while to settle things down. We are now re-opening it!



🇩🇰 About the group : We are a group of people with all kinds of interests! The group started after I posted on the subreddit that I was looking for people in Cph :) We all use English to communicate but we have some native Danes among us that help us with Danish stuff (administration, skat, or whatever hell you're going through). We are a very international group, and have people from all corners of the world. We are people between early 20s to end 30s years old, but we restrict the group to 18+ people only.



🎮What we do :

* Meet up to watch movies,
* Play board games, play d&d,
* Go to events together in CPH (visit museums, Kulturnat, Sakura Festival, Distortion, Football games)
* Game together (CS2, League, Dota2, Overwatch, Valorant, Velheim, etc)
* Just chill out downtown around a cup of coffee
* Play badminton together
* Talk together on our Discord server

If you are new to Cph and doesn't really know anyone, or if you're just looking for people with the same interests as us, here is the Discord link: [https://discord.gg/GNNcpsQB](https://discord.gg/GNNcpsQB)

A quick note:

This community has grown a lot and I would like to emphasize that we are quite strict with lurkers and inactive people to protect the people on the server. Please join if you really intend to interact and be part of the group. We also aim to be an offline community as much as possible, so we put a emphasis on meeting up IRL as well (as to not be terminally online)

Have a nice one yall! -Marie 😎",10,1736774747.0,copenhagen,0,1.0,False
1i0dvhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1i0dvhl/getting_sick_fixed_me/,Getting sick fixed me??,"
Maybe ‘improved’ is a better word? For the past 4 years, I’ve been struggling digestive, neurological, endocrine, urological, and circulation issues. I’m drier than the Sahara, I’ve had several episodes of incontinence (from both sides), urgency issues for almost 2 years, lost 20-30lbs (I’ve been trying to gain weight, was underweight now am slightly less underweight), waking up nauseous for 4-5 hours every morning and commonly just had nausea all day. Lost my period over a year and a half ago. Developed raynaud’s, severe joint pain, my sodium levels seem fragile (have to always play around with water and salt intake), I get hypercalcaemia symptoms if I take two antacids (max dose is 7-12 in 24hrs or something like that) for two days in a row. 

My hands and feet are constantly ice cold, skin is mottled and purplish, sometimes fingers purple even when relaxing in my warm house (not raynauds… raynauds turns me white then red, never purple and is never impacted by stress). I get weakness strong enough that sometimes I am too weak to breathe and my parents have to watch me to see if it passes or if I need an ambulance. I was extremely nauseous before Christmas. Was trying to increase food intake but lost all interest in food for 3-4 days before I caught a cold from my dad (it made the rounds in my house, I was last). Oh and my limbs will often enough just decide to turn off for a while (completely limp/numb, just a floppy appendage dangling off my body).

My BP has been low for 2+ years (70s/40s at the lowest, usually 80s/50s), with a resting HR average in the high 40s. Nothing wrong in bloodwork. CT and MRI are crystal clear. 


When I got the cold, my nausea just disappeared. It’s only been back twice since then. Fully recovered from the cold around January 8th. It was a slight cold, was super tired, achy, temp went up by only half a degree (never reached 100F), and had a sore throat. Since then, my skin has not been dry. I’m disgustingly moist. I started having horrible night sweats to where my entire room smelled. I’m used to never sweating, *ever*. Then I started being clammy any time I felt cold. When I was warm, no clamminess. I stopped feeling cold constantly. I’m no longer wearing long sleeves + a hoodie and wanting a blanket in my house. My hands and feet are in less pain in the mornings (not as cold). My joints are still not great, but they ache less. I’m still disgustingly moist, but I drank almost 2L of salted water the other day and I’ve had two electrolyte drinks and I’m way less gross now. My legs will still feel cold but my shoulders, neck, face, even upper back, boobs, and hands will be clammy?? 

My resting HR has increased from high 40s to low 50s (I have a Fitbit and have checked it several times for accuracy. It’s accurate. My average HR has gone up by 5-8 in the past month. It’s always been ‘stable’ at 47-49. This month it’s averaging 54 so far. Usually when I wake up, it’s around 45-49. Woke up this morning and it’s at 55. Weird. 

I also noticed—(TMI) I’ve been self conscious about my chest for a long time because after losing so much weight and being all dried out constantly, I had a saggy chest. Right now I have a youthful ‘plump’ chest again for the first time in over 2 years??? (If anyone sends a DM about my chest, I’d prefer you get hit by a plane. You have better chances at getting pics from your mom than from me). 

I’m still having other issues. Raynauds is still happening, still joint pain, still very bad fatigue. Still mottling, still confusion episodes and I’ve had no appetite the past two days (had to force myself to eat something). But I’m not constantly cold. I’m not dried out. I’m still weirdly moist. I still wake up smelling because of that (which I’ve never had before—I have ichthyosis so my skin has always been too think for me to sweat or smell anything because I also just rarely sweat). No noticeable swelling anywhere. My skin almost feels like normal supple skin for once in my life—upper body only (legs are still a bit dry and not as warm). But rn I’m feeling slightly chilly and I’m clammy (can smell it 🥲). 

So… wtf??

**TLDR**: *caught the cold a little after new year’s and ever since recovering (almost a week now), I’m no longer freezing cold below 23.5C (74F), I’m clammy all the time* unless it’s warm, *nausea greatly reduced, less aches, my skin is actually retaining moisture for the first time in years, and I think my urgency issues may be improving, because water isnt just flying through me right now. It’s actually absorbing into me. I feel a bit cold rn because I can’t go out on my sweater because I’m clammy and gross already so the sweater would just make it worse.*

*wtf is going on?? This is gonna be a royal pain in the diagnostic process (doc gave up on me a while ago, and now MORE weird things that don’t make sense??) btw I’m *less* thirsty instead of more, also noticed yesterday I’ve been salting all my food a LOT, no fruity-smelling anything, and I’ve had to carry around a hand towel with me to wipe my neck & shoulders with.*

I’m so confused and idk if unsagged tits is worth all this gross clammy skin stuff. Feels super uncomfortable and me never having BO was the one silver lining I knew I could always count on 😭

Recent changes:
* increasing fat intake—(specifically fats with omega 3 & omega 6. I’ve got dry eyes so figured upping the omega 6 could potentially help. It hasn’t. My stomach is sensitive to fatty/greasy foods so I’ve been eating 7 walnut halves to get the daily dose without hurting my stomach)
* cut down drastically on vitamin A (I turned orange after being a bit of a pumpkin, spinach, carrot, yam, etc. addict. I’m finally less orange, but I’ve still always had an orange-green undertone to my skin that no one else in my family has). I’ve been avoiding anything high in vitamin A since beginning of December in order to get rid of the orange tint. (I still eat lots of fruits and veggies, just ones with less vitA).
* stopped taking vitamin D (got hypercalcaemia symptoms again after taking antacids while extremely nauseous so cut down on VitD for a few days)
* cut out caffeine at the beginning of December. Had caffeine 3x since then. No coffee, tea, energy drinks, no caffeinated pop since then.
* my ravenous sweet tooth has died down in the past week.
* I am still underweight but I’ve put on a LOT of water weight (which I discovered after thinking I had put on weight but then ended up very dehydrated for 2 days and dropped 10lbs. Normal water weight for me is 5ish lbs, not 10!) but no pudgy feet or anything like that. (Also, my weight loss is a result of struggling to eat—nausea, full easily, no appetite—not from eating and not gaining).

They remind us of God’s faithfulness and set the tone for the day ahead. That’s why seeking God first in the morning is crucial. David declared, “O Lord, in the morning you hear my voice” (Ps 5:3).

A God-honoring morning begins with intentionality. Proper rest the night before ensures we rise refreshed, ready to glorify God through prayer and Scripture. Prayer allows us to thank, praise, and align ourselves with God’s will. Scripture reminds us of his promises, equips us for the day, and strengthens our faith.

This is not about following a rigid formula but cultivating communion with God. Whether you pray before getting out of bed, read Scripture over coffee, or take a quiet walk to reflect, the goal is to start your day in fellowship with your Creator.

Your morning routine can be an act of worship, offering your first moments to God, who renews his mercies with every sunrise. As David said, “Earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for you” (Ps 63:1). May this be the cry of our hearts each morning.",2,1736774603.0,Christians,0,1.0,False

1i0dlgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVpnEng/comments/1i0dlgw/best_vpns_for_melbourne/,Best VPNs for Melbourne,"Looking for a reliable VPN in Melbourne? I've tested over 50 VPNs and narrowed down the top choices that offer fast speeds, strong security, and reliable connections in Australia. Let me show you what I found.

# Why You Need a VPN in Melbourne

Using public WiFi at Federation Square or your local coffee shop? A VPN keeps your data safe. But that's not all - here's why Melbourne residents need a VPN:

* **Public WiFi Security**: Stay protected when using unsecured networks at cafes, universities, or co-working spaces
* **Access Content**: Watch US Netflix, BBC iPlayer, and other streaming services
* **Data Privacy**: Australian law requires ISPs to store user data for 2 years - a VPN helps maintain your privacy
* **Better Gaming**: Reduce lag and protect yourself from DDoS attacks while gaming
* **Stream Sports**: Watch AFL, NRL, and cricket streams without geo-blocks

# Top 5 VPNs for Melbourne

# 1. NordVPN - Best Overall VPN for Melbourne

* 176 servers in Australia with dedicated Melbourne location

* Works with Netflix, Disney+, and local Australian services
* 30-day money-back guarantee

**Cons:**

* Higher monthly cost compared to competitors
* No free trial option
* Limited to 8 simultaneous connections

I tested NordVpnVPN extensively in Melbourne and consistently got download speeds over 85% of my base connection. The dedicated Melbourne servers made streaming local content butter smooth.

# 4. Surfshark - Best Value for Money

**Cons:**

# How to Choose a VPN for Melbourne

Here's what matters most when picking a VPN:

# Local Server Coverage

More servers in Melbourne means better speeds. Look for:

* Multiple server locations in Australia
* Dedicated Melbourne servers
* Server load information
* P2P support if needed

# Speed and Performance

A VPN shouldn't slow you down much. Good VPNs typically maintain:

* 80%+ of your regular download speed
* Low ping increase (under 20ms)
* Stable connections

# Security Features

Must-have security features include:

* **AES-256 encryption**
* **Kill switch**
* **DNS leak protection**
* **No-logs policy**
* **Split tunneling**

# Streaming Support

If you want to stream, check for:

* Netflix compatibility
* Local service access (7plus, 9Now, etc.)
* Buffer-free HD streaming
* Smart DNS features

# Setting Up Your Melbourne VPN

1. **Choose a Plan**: Pick a VPN that fits your needs
2. **Download**: Get the app for your device
3. **Install**: Follow the setup wizard
4. **Connect**: Select a Melbourne server
5. **Verify**: Check for IP/DNS leaks

# Common VPN Questions

**Q: Are VPNs legal in Melbourne?** *A: Yes, VPNs are completely legal in Australia. Just don't use them for illegal activities.*

**Q: Will a VPN slow my NBN connection?** *A: Good VPNs reduce speed by only 10-20%. Pick servers in Melbourne for best performance.*

**Q: Can I use free VPNs?** *A: While free VPNs exist, they're risky. They might sell your data or have poor security. Stick with trusted paid services.*

# Tips for Using VPNs in Melbourne

1. **Connect to Local Servers**: Use Melbourne servers for best speeds with Australian sites
2. **Check Streaming Rules**: Some services block VPNs, so verify compatibility
3. **Use Split Tunneling**: Route only necessary traffic through the VPN
4. **Enable Auto-Connect**: Stay protected when using public WiFi
5. **Keep Software Updated**: Regular updates improve security and performance

# Final Thoughts

After months of testing, **NordVPN** leads the pack for Melbourne users. Its blend of speed, security, and reliable local servers makes it hard to beat. However, **CyberGhost** offers great value, while **Private Internet Access** provides outstanding server coverage.

Pick based on your needs:

* **Best Overall**: **NordVPN**
* **Budget Choice**: Surfshark
* **Privacy Focus**: ProtonVPN
* **Ease of Use**: CyberGhost
* **Server Options**: Private Internet Access

Remember, all recommended VPNs offer money-back guarantees, so you can test them risk-free. Start with **NordVPN** if unsure - its Melbourne servers haven't let me down yet.

# Stay Safe Online

A VPN is just one piece of online security. Combine it with:

* Good passwords
* Two-factor authentication
* Updated software
* Common sense browsing habits

The internet's gotten trickier to navigate safely, but a solid VPN gives you a good foundation for privacy and security in Melbourne.",1,1736773862.0,TheVpnEng,0,1.0,False

1i0dksj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1i0dksj/just_returned_15_day_itinerary/,Just returned - 15 day itinerary ,"Hi everyone, we just returned from our just over 2 week Costa Rica Roadtrip, and did SO much research with Reddit before, I thought I'd share what I found most helpful in case it helps anyone else :) We did a mix of low budget activities / sodas, and a few splurges

Our itinerary below, which we did by SUV - we were super happy with all of our hotels where we had breakfast too, so let me know if you want those I haven't mentioned :)

San Jose (1N) -> Puerto Viejo (3N including NYE) -> Sarapiqui (1N) -> La Fortuna (2N) -> Monteverde (2N) -> Rincon de la Vieja (2N) -> Samara Beach (2N) -> San José (1N)

**San José:**

Between the first & second time, our favourite spots were **Cafeoteca for amazing Costa Rican speciality coffee** from all regions of Costa Rica & great pastries - if you love coffee, this is so worth a visit, as well as **Restaurante Silvestre** in Barrio Amon (some cute buildings in the neighbourhood), where we did the 7-course tasting menu which is all about local ingredients & Costa Rican history in a beautiful setting. Definitely more expensive than I would usually spend (55000 pP), but very much worth it to finish the trip with!

Close to the Mercado Central we went to **La Casa del Cacao** to buy chocolate to take home, which is in a very beautiful building and tastes amazing (they also do a chocolate making workshop).

**Puerto Viejo -** sadly had a lot of rain, so missed out on a few things we wanted to do (Jaguar Rescue Centre & Catato Cacao tour which supports indigenous Cacao makers!)

**Cahuita National Park** was one of our favourite hikes, for diverse flora & fauna, forest & beach (very sandy and beautiful) and even spotted some sloths! (As well as monkeys, iguanas etc)

We had the Jerk Box at **Mr Cloud's Munchies** which was enough for 2 at $10 and super tasty

Also had dinner at **SOCA & Koki Beach** for a Birthday & NYE, which is a bit fancier but beautiful!

For drinks we researched Johnny's Beach Bar & Hot Rocks - Hot Rocks is right on the main road, but it's very, very loud, was fun for playing pool though!

**Sarapiqui:**

Again super rainy - probably one we could've easily missed, but loved seeing all the birds in the forest!

**La Fortuna:**

We had the best experience at a Soda there (**Soda Viquez**) - just a normal soda, but the Casado Pescado was the best we had on the trip!

Because of the heavy rains, we saw the Volcano from afar on day 1, but our hotel (**Lavas Tacotal**) had an amazing view of it. Otherwise we really enjoyed doing the **Ecotermales Hot Springs**, which seemed to be the best mid-range hot springs (we reserved 4 days in advance as it seems to book out), and spent a rainy day in the hot thermal water. We also researched a bunch of other things like this [Free Pools & cheap hiking Map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/viewer?mid=1lhfIKrc29f24TGm0s9SvytEFO6ZkW8w&ll=10.557170672668981%2C-84.86610295&z=11) I saw recommended on Reddit, but due to the weather skipped it!

Also had food at  **Red Frog Café** where we had the best Empanada + Frijoles on the trip - super flaky & crispy

The **hanging bridges** were fun, but feel a bit like Disneyland - if you want to do it for the Instagram it's great, but other hikes are definitely more fun with more content :)

**Monteverde:**

Definitely true that it's significantly colder here than anywhere else - plus it is always misty / slightly rainy, so make sure you pack long clothes that dry easily!

Our favourite thing here was the **hike through the cloud forest** \- there are 3 reserves there, and we went for the quieter side of the reserve, Santa Elena, which also happens to be a bit cheaper - for $30pP we got a guide, who showed us a few things we would've missed like Tarantulas, explained the history of the cloud forest & different plants etc. - you do then have time to hike by yourself and we did the 5km Caño Negro trail which is an intermediate hike with an amazing viewing platform over the clouds (on a clear day you are supposed to be able to see 4 volcanos from up there).

Dinner in Monteverde was amazing at **Soda Canton 83** \- their house rice was SO tasty!! We also tried the Treehouse restaurant right in the little city, but that was massively overpriced & I would skip next time.

**Café Monteverde** again incredible for speciality coffee in all brewing methods - ended up taking some of their beans home :)

**Rincon de la Vieja:**

Didn't see much on this before, but that was one of my favourite stops! We stayed at **Rinconcito Lodge** which I can wholeheartedly recommend - they have a little hike next to the hotel you can do for free, which takes you to a beautiful viewpoint over the mountains and even a small waterfall where we had a little swim!

The actual **Rincon de la vieja volcano** was great - 2 areas and we did the Las Pailas Track - $30 entry (which you have to buy in advance) + a 700 colonnes toll pP to get there via a private road (bring cash), and you get 2 choices of trails - we did the shorter one here, which takes you through the active volcano safely (last erupted in 2019)! You get to see mud pots, bubbling water, a mini volcano etc. as well as wildlife such as spider monkeys etc. On the way out is a **private Hot springs (Rio Negro)**, which is another $30 pP, but includes lots of different pools ranging from 37C - 40C, mud for your body + another waterfall hike - definitely less spa-like, but SUPER fun after the longer hike!

  
**Samara Beach:**

This was a great way to finish out our trip!

Our highlights were happy hour at **Bahia** and a Kayak Trip to **Isla Chora** which is very small but cute (rented a 2-people Kayak for $12 an hour from Pato's Surfschool) - the water was very rough and it wasn't an easy trip navigating through waves & past some rocks, but still super fun! If you surf, I think that would be the better option though!

Foodwise we had had so much local food from sodas at this point, we went to **BM Burgers** (which was surprisingly amazing) and Roots for iced Coffee, which was also good!

**Things to know before going:**

The trip was expensive - whether it's local sodas, supermarkets or regular restaurants etc., everything was more expensive than we had thought. Be prepared that it's like Western prices or more, and most hikes cost money too, as the parks are almost all private (which does mean the wildlife is doing super well, so I suppose that's worth it!) and cost between $10-$20 pP entry

Uber was the only thing that was cheaper here - particularly in touristy places like Puerto Viejo it works out better than TukTuks for example

The roads are tricky - definitely travel with a 4x4 if you can, some roads are more hole-y gravel paths than roads. In cities the traffic rules aren't always clear and people drive somewhat creatively 

Although the weather apps don't seem to work properly in Costa Rica, it's uncharacteristically rainy at the moment - because it's also humid things take so long to dry that we mostly spent time in sports clothes - so layer up in easy to dry things!

The Costa Rican cuisine is very mild unlike some of their neighbours but we learned to love Salsa Lizano!

If you think you've packed enough Bug Spray / bite gel for afterwards - pack more!

Mucho Gusto = Costa Rican version of de nada (you're welcome) - everyone here has been so kind to us, and any time we've greeted / thanked people in Spanish they were even nicer :) ",5,1736773798.0,CostaRicaTravel,2,1.0,False

He is sober from alcohol and porn/sex addiction. He works from home, I’m a SAHM, and I’m dying from the anxiety. He has a coworker (female) who has gushed over how amazing he is, how smart, how clever, how impressive, “can you give me career advice” because of everyone you are just Soooo amazing, type stuff. He has a history of emotional affairs, one online and a female coworker he was hiding the extent of his connection with who he was texting on vacation and at night and who he would go on coffee dates alone with at work. I had no idea. He has a history of a bunch of other nauseating stuff, he seems to get off on the idea (reality, like in pictures) of seeing women he knows naked. To the point of actively stealing or searching out images on their personal devices or online. He has lied to me over and over again. And yet, we have been doing well for a few months and he has been so attentive. 

He quit alcohol 2 years ago after issues, and now he is up there and “everyone but him” is getting wasted. He looked up alcohol websites for macros (I can see his history), and I lost my shit thinking he dropped his sobriety. He turned it around on me, saying how could I think that? How do I not trust him after all the work he has put in? But, fucking really? Dude, you are lucky I’m still here. Just explain yourself and don’t be an indignant asshat. Holy shit. 

Apparently, he looked this up 4 times during his night out not drinking with the guys (and girls) (keep in mind he is very into his physique and the site had to do with fit drinks if you will), to show other people the site. I actually believe him, but the fact that he doesn’t see how guilty it makes him look it absolutely ridiculous. It makes me angry and sick that he is such a self righteous asshole that can’t see how much he has traumatized me and that it won’t just disappear because he has been “good” for less than 6 months after 20 years of betrayal, lies, and abuse. I’m so sad and angry and I don’t know what to do with myself or how to empower myself to feel less fucking out of control in my marriage.

I've been wracking my brain for a couple of weeks now and no solution seems in sight.  I cannot tell if my issue is specific to klipperscreen or the BTT Pi adapter+CB1 I'm using.  Long story short touch control on a 7"" HDMI display in klipperscreen (and ONLY klipperscreen) just randomly stops until I move the USB cable to a different port on the Pi adapter board.  Any port will do as all ports exhibit this same behaviour.  There's no warning or consistent amount of time/number of touches.  It just happens...or it doesn't.  No rhyme or reason.  It really appears to me like the driver is crashing/going to sleep (or something like that) and it ONLY happens when using klipperscreen.  When connected to a windows or linux mint PC the screen works perfectly and touch is flawless.  I've also tried a 32GB EMMC CB1 (pulled from my M5P) and it does the exact same thing.  The ONLY commonalities are the screen and the Pi adapter board.

I have completely reflashed the image a number of times, installed the specific drivers for these displays (I have 2 that use the exact same chipset), uninstalled and reinstalled klipperscreen and followed every config change I can find and nothing has helped.  I see many options for configuring the HDMI but nothing relating specifically to USB or touch.  HDMI works perfectly.  Literally over a dozen USB cables used and all have the same issue but ONLY with the Pi.  I'm assuming this is all embedded and no user specific config is required...but something ain't right here.  Seeing as all other USB devices remain connected and functional I don't believe it has anything to do with a physical fault with the Pi adapter but I am at a loss.

I've asked the klipperscreen experts for advice with this same scenario but I was hoping that an expert with the Pi adapter boards might know something.  Anyone have any ideas?

Update:  I was just making a coffee and heard my printer finish its print job and when I came down sure enough there was no touch control.  I don't know why I NEVER thought of this before but I connected via PuTTY, logged into the CB1 and did an LSUSB and got the below.

I moved the USB cable to a different port and lo and behold touch was back so I did another LSUSB and got this instead.

**1. Why I’m Here (Spoiler: I Need a Friend!)**

Hey there! I’m on a mission to find a new friend (potential BFF?) in Bangalore. Life can be tough, and having someone to share laughs, random adventures, and existential crises with can make it so much brighter. I moved here almost a year ago, and while I adore the city’s cool weather and super-friendly folks, it can get a tad lonely. So, if you’re game for exploring (or just hanging at home watching silly videos), I’m your person!

* **Fun Fact:** I’ll even treat you to a cold drink, though I don’t really drink anymore but who knows, if the vibe matches we might be starting Hangover (Bengaluru edition)

**2. My (Slightly Awkward) Social Backstory**

Making friends was always a struggle for me growing up. I didn’t really make solid friends until I was 12, and even those turned out to be less than ideal. With most of my current friends far away—or too busy—I’m hoping to build a new, lasting connection right here in Bangalore. The pandemic slowed down socializing, but it’s finally over, and I’m determined to find that awesome friend who’s in it for the long haul.

* **What I’m Looking For:** A genuine bond—someone who wants to travel, try new things, share secrets, and stick around through thick and thin. If you’re on the same wavelength, let’s be each other’s lifesavers!

**3. A Peek into My Mind & Mood**

I’ve faced my share of blues and anxiety, but I’m doing much better now. My family says I’ve transformed from a grumpy French bulldog to a happy golden retriever (woof!). Like anyone, I still have off days, but I won’t ghost you—I promise. I totally get if you need a break sometimes, too. We can always pick up right where we left off!

**4. My Passions & Quirks**

* **Head in the Clouds:** I’m a daydreamer who loves getting lost in books. Currently plotting a career shift, because adulting is hard.
* **Outdoorsy-ish:** Hiking trails, road trips, camping—I’m all for it! But I also enjoy cozy nights in (sometimes with Netflix, sometimes with crosswords that I may or may not rage-quit).
* **Writing:** I love putting pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard). Check out my Reddit profile if you’re curious about my scribbles.
* **Music Buff:** I’m into everything except punk metal. Bowie is my jam, but I also love Indian Indie artists like Prateek Kuhad, Ritviz, Aditi Ramesh, and Aarifah Rebello. I’ve got a playlist for every mood—hit me up if you want some recommendations!
* **Classical & Jazz:** Still exploring these genres. I’m not an audiophile, but my Sony WH-1000XM3 and AirPods do the job.
* **Animals:** I once fostered a dog and a cat, and they really helped me deal with loneliness. Now I have my own cat—but let’s be real, cats are the real bosses of the house so a cat now owns me.
* **Collector Extraordinaire:** Letters (old and new), stamps, boarding passes—you name it, I probably keep it. I even write letters to myself when I need a pep talk.
* **TV & Podcasts:** Love shows like Final Space (humor + sci-fi = chef’s kiss) and Only Murders in the Building S2 (crime + comedy = yes, please). I’m also into true crime podcasts, finance, books, movies, music—basically anything I can binge on road trips.
* **New Car & Old Car:** I recently got a new car (already scratched it, no dents though—whew!). My old 2008 i10, a.k.a. Meenakshi, is still around but deserves a peaceful retirement soon.

**5. My Latest Hobbies (a.k.a. Ways I Avoid Doing Chores)**

* **Gardening:** Reviving my grandma’s neglected garden. I’m replanting, repotting, and trying to grow fruit trees like avocado, mangosteen, mango, and rambutan. Also experimenting with hydroponics for lettuce because…salad!
* **Fishing:** I’m not a strong swimmer (ironic, I know), and I don’t eat the fish—I just catch and release. Went on a boat trip recently and had a blast despite the rain. City fishing isn’t as dramatic as on nature docs, but it’s still fun.
* **Reading:** Attempting the 52 Books challenge. I’m at 14 (don’t judge!). Currently reading Catch 52 at a snail’s pace, just finished The Island of Missing Trees by Elif Shafak, and next up is Maame by Jessica George. I also love In Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust.
* **Digital Art:** Using Procreate to sketch important people in my life. Learning layers is both exciting and mildly confusing.
* **Gaming:** I have a few favorites—Red Dead Redemption 2, GTA V, Apex, COD Warzone, and I just finished God of War Ragnarok. Going for that Platinum trophy, baby! Hogwarts Legacy is next on my list (yes, I’ve heard all the drama).

**6. Why We Should Be BFFs**

* **Almost 24/7 Chat Availability:** I’m a night owl, so if you’re awake at 4 AM questioning life choices, I’m around.
* **Listener & Secret-Keeper:** Vent about your day, your boss, or your favorite TV character’s questionable decisions. I’ll keep it confidential (unless it’s super illegal, then…um, maybe 911?).
* **IRL Hangouts:** If you’re in Bangalore, I’ll bring snacks or coffee—or both! I travel for work, so we might even cross paths in another city.
* **Life is Hard, Let’s Help Each Other:** Need career advice? Fitness buddy? Study partner? I’m here for it all.
* **No Ghost Zone:** I’ve been ghosted; it’s not fun. I won’t do that to you.
* **Memes, Humor & Kitty Pics:** I have an endless stash, ready to brighten your day.
* **Cooking Wizardry:** Especially desserts. You have been warned—I will feed you.
* **Ride or Die:** I’ve got your back, figuratively or literally (shovel in hand).

**7. The Friendship Contract (Not Legally Binding, but Just Pure Fun!)**

I’m looking for a long-lasting friendship that brightens our days. We can talk daily or whenever time allows—swap silly memes, watch dumb movies together, go on long drives, or dive into deep, thought-provoking conversations. I love people who are a bit extroverted (although it's a spectrum and I'm mostly on the introvert side), overshare (I’m guilty, too!), and aren’t afraid to be kind and affectionate.

* **No Ghosting, Please:** Let’s put effort into our conversations. One-word replies are the conversational equivalent of a sad trombone.
* **Be Yourself:** Gender, sexuality, race, timezone—none of that matters. Just bring your authentic self.
* **Fun is Mandatory:** If the topic gets boring, we’ll switch it up. Life’s too short for dull chats.
* **Platform Flexibility:** Reddit chat can be glitchy, so if you prefer another platform, just say the word.

**8. Ready to Chat?**

If you’re up for a new buddy who’ll share memes, secrets, random life stories, and maybe some questionable desserts (they’re delicious, trust me), send me a message! I can’t wait to get to know you and see what adventures we can cook up together.

**TL;DR:** I’m looking for a genuine friend in Bangalore (or anywhere else, really). I’m fun, I don’t bite (unless you’re a brownie), and I promise not to ghost you. Let’s connect, share some laughs, and conquer the world one silly joke at a time.

**Bela** = my soon to be wife F/32

**Cali** = friend F/32

We all studied at the same city and we were really close. We know each other for approximately 10 years now. Cali has called us family and we have called her back the same. We trusted her fully. For example, I provided my student-housing space for her to live during her phd for a whole year while I lived with my soon-to-be wife. Any damage done to the space would be up to me to fix. At the end of her stay I gifted to Cali almost every single item I owned in my student room. I had a stable income and she was kind of struggling in the mid of the phd while we already have what we needed with Bela in Bela's house, so it was OK.

While Cali doesn't come from a rich family and she has lost her mother at a young age, both me and Bela are coming from pretty large and poor immigrant families too, so we know how it is to struggle so we were always happy to be able to directly help struggling people. Build a longer table, not higher walls, right?

We didn't always agree on everything in life with Cali, but everyone seemed more than OK with this; we had common core values and this is what was important to us, and it's nice to surround yourself with people that challenge you. The feeling was mutual.

About 5 years ago Cali was finishing up with her phd and we were discussing if it would be a good idea the 3 of us to become roommates, but I and Bela ended up dismissing the idea because we didn't want to ""limit ourselves"" (aka walk around naked in our own house 😅) - we had roommates in the past and we simply didn't want to return back to this way of living at 27 yo if we could afford not to. A good friend doesn't necessarily make a good roommate after all, and poses risks to the friendship.

When we shared our thoughts to her, she didn't seem happy about it at all, but we did stand our ground and listed our reasons. What we didn't know was that this roommate situation was probably Cali's only chance to stay at the city we were studying and now living at. She never said anything to us about it and I understand that she didn't want to be pushy about it or force us to something we didn't want. The next thing we know is that she is moving back to live with her father and brother. We were honestly a bit confused but we understood that the situation sucked for all and we let it be.

We loved her a lot and, while long-distance we continued talking with her. Not crazy regularly but every email and conversation was as if no day had passed. She started working in her home city and supporting more her family and while we learnt (from her father) that she was really upset to leave our uni city, she was now content and happy. Cali didn't seem as if was keeping any grudges.

A few years later we invited her to holidays to a foreign country, with both transport and accommodation paid for by us. She was reluctant to accept such an offer (understandably) but we really wanted to spend time with her and we could afford it, and we persuaded her after explaining that the financials were not an issue. And we honestly had an awesome time, along with other friends. We were more than happy to be able to provide this experience to our friends.

3 years ago me and SO moved to a different country, looking for a better quality of life and we kept contact with this friend, of course, though she did turn down a few suggestions to meet up now and then (in our home country) and she hasn't put the effort into meeting up. A few other common friends had the same issue with her, e.g. they were visiting for 3 days her home city and she turned down invitations for going for a coffee, just for a few hours. Cali is deep into learning new stuff constantly and this helps with her work (works in a field where the more you have done in an academic level the easier it is to stay at the same place or get promotions, etc). She is in the process of doing a 2nd master's now. So the excuse was always that she is very pressed and she cannot do anything. She has told us in the past that she used to say yes to a lot of stuff and that she is now prioritizing herself the last few years because the alternative caused her anxiety.

Her friends around her that have discussed this issue, including me and Bela, think that her dedication to what she is doing at this age is more than excessive. If you always prioritize work over your friends that you haven't seen in many months, then it is understandable that your friends are not very happy with you. Everyone is busy with life after all, and we put the time to make it work. You reap what you sow. Ourselves were extremely busy with integrating into a new country, navigating the bureaucracy, learning a new language and getting a social network, but at the same time we made sure to visit and try to organize things.

Me and Bela are together for 8 years now so we were thinking to get married. We never wanted a big marriage or to mix the parents in it (recipe for disaster with our families) and we always wanted a very small wedding with only the closest of the closest people. So we invited just 5 people to be present to our civil wedding.

Fast-forward to last week. When we broke the news to Cali, she literally reacted the following way:

\- Hmm let me check my calendar... Yeah 2 days after this date I have to submit an exercise which is part of my grade, so I will have to think about it.

We were caught completely off guard. No ""Congrats"", no ""I'm happy for you"". No ""I'll do anything I can to make it work, even though I'm busy"". No ""I'm honored to be considered so close to you that you thought of me in such a small wedding"". I saw it in the face of Bela that she was disappointed. I felt the same. And it showed in our voice. So Cali asked us what's up, and I was brave enough to tell her ""Honestly, we are a little disappointed by your reaction, you are a very close friend and we want you to come, it's a wedding - not a birthday. If you were getting married I would do literally everything in my hand to be there and I understand you are busy but people have made it work when it comes to weddings for centuries"". I didn't scream or anything of course, the delivery was calm but surely the tone showed the disappointment. Cali probably felt very bad and after a few seconds she told us that she will reply soon. In her voice it seemed clear that she felt a lot of pressure.

Me and Bela, despite the reaction, looked around to see if there is a possibility to change the dates, which shouldn't be terribly hard with so few people in attendance. We sent an email to all the attendands to make it easier to communicate, and she replied that we don't know her or we don't care about her and she won't be coming in any date anyway, also to not speak to her because she is very upset and if she feels good, then she will let us know.

Me and Bela think that our reaction was apropriate and we expressed how we felt. We felt that her reply was very ego-centric and with complete disregard abour our feelings, and honestly it feels as if she showed her new real colors, because she definitely doesn't seem like the same woman we knew years ago. We are very disappointed the last few days and we really want to understand how this came to develop this way and if it is possible to save this valuable to us relationship. At the same time, we are really really confused about this whole ordeal.

Dear r/relationship_advice, can you help me see where we failed in this relationship? Can you give us advice on how could we possibly proceed to salvage this relationship?",1,1736772098.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False

***China has a chokehold on the world’s supply of critical minerals – and experts are warning the situation is a major risk to US national security if the government doesn’t step up its efforts to compete.***

***Control over rare earth metals – which are needed to build everything from the semiconductors that power iPhones to wind turbines, electric vehicle batteries and military weaponry like tanks and missiles – have become a key point of friction and souring trade relations between the US and China.***  

***Burdensome regulations and decades of lackluster investment have left the US dangerously reliant on China – which mines up to 70% of the world’s critical minerals, controls roughly 90% of the processing capacity and regularly uses unfair trade tactics to press its advantage, sources told The Post.***

# “The fact that we are reliant on China for defense equipment is just a completely unfathomable and untenable situation,” said Pini Althaus, CEO of the New York-based firm USA Rare Earth.

If diplomatic relations get worse or an actual conflict breaks out the two countries, US lawmakers and experts fear that China, led by President Xi Jinping, could cut off the supply entirely – with disastrous consequences for the US auto industry, tech firms and the Pentagon.

“Quite frankly, they can turn off the faucet,” Althaus added.

[Rare earth metals and other critical minerals are used to build everything from smartphones to military weaponry.Los Angeles Times via Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/2788037l6rce1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ee1856fb5fc460d3c064ff93d08daf6bab94b51)

China’s decades-long effort to corner the market is heavily subsidized by Beijing, which uses its control over the supply to manipulate prices and enacts ever-tighter export controls to cement its dominance. China has also snapped up mineral rights throughout Africa and other resource-rich locales as part of its Belt and Road Initiative – on highly favorable terms.

When the US or other rivals make progress on mining or processing a particular material, such as gallium or lithium, China often responds by flooding the market – which sends prices tumbling and kills the incentive to invest in projects, according to Rep. Rob Wittman (R-Va.), who leads the House Select Committee on China’s Critical Minerals Policy Working Group.

“They dump massive amounts of these materials on the market and they do that below the cost of production – so these companies can’t even compete,” Wittman added.

China has already begun to weaponize its control – in part by implementing export bans on mining and processing technology. Last month, China banned exports of three critical minerals to the US – gallium, germanium and antimony – and previously imposed restrictions on shipments of graphite.

The idea of a total embargo isn’t so far-fetched. In 2010, China briefly halted shipments of rare earth elements to Japan while the two countries were embroiled in a territorial dispute.

China has an estimated 44 million tons of rare earth reserves – or 34% of the worldwide total, according to US Geological Survey data. By comparison, the US has about 2.3 million tons of reserves.

Despite the disparity, the US “absolutely has significant deposits” of key minerals, according to Wittman, who points to sites in Minnesota, Nevada and California as well as vast untapped sources in the seabed that could be claimed.

The US began moving away from rare earth mining in the 1980s as environmental concerns gave rise to increasingly rigorous permitting and licensing rules. As businesses looked offshore for their supply needs, mining profits diminished and domestic production dwindled.

As of now, the permitting process is “still very cumbersome,” according to Barbara Arnold, a professor of mining engineering at Penn State University.

Standards are far more rigorous in the US than other countries like Canada and Australia. The process of getting a new project off the ground is costly and difficult, which has disincentivized firms from exploring for new mining sites.

“From the time that you actually locate a deposit of something to the time that you’re actually producing it, it can be 20 years. It can be 10 years just to get the permits,” said Arnold. “Those are all absolutely needed, but there should be a mechanism to get those permits through more expeditiously.”

By comparison, China imposes few environmental restrictions on its mining projects – and has built a domestic supply chain “contaminated with forced labor and environmentally degrading mining and refining practices,” according to a recent report by the select committee.

“China would be the opposite extreme, meaning there’s almost no permitting rigors whatsoever,” Althaus said.

To strengthen its supply chain outside of China, the US should aim to ramp up partnerships with Canada and Australia, according to Althaus. Resource-heavy countries in Central Asia and Africa, which have traditionally fallen under China’s sway, are another option.

[China has built a near-monopoly for key critical minerals over the last several decades.Bloomberg via Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/es9uvg6w6rce1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=51584458755c1868ab420a4e5071a5c6616bcf61)

On the domestic front, US government support for early-stage exploration of criminal minerals and local processing capabilities would go a long way, he added.

Canada, for example, offers “flow-through shares” that make investments in so-called junior mining outfits tax-deductible. The smaller firms handle site exploration and assess the feasibility of a given site, then approach larger firms to bankroll operations.

Last month, Wittman and his colleagues introduced a trio of bills aimed at boosting the US critical mineral supply chain and limiting dependence on China.

The bills would authorize more funding for US collaboration with friendly nations on critical mineral supply chains; impose export controls on domestic battery and magnet materials; and set up a “Resilient Resource Reserve” that would help protect US producers from China’s price manipulation.

“We are not going to combat them in any other way other than having an alternative to what China does. And I think we can do that, and I think we can do that quickly,” Wittman said.

**VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / January 13, 2025 /** Stillwater Critical Minerals Corp. (TSX.V:PGE)(OTCQB:PGEZF)(FSE:J0G) (the ""Company"" or ""Stillwater"") is pleased to provide an overview and status update on its ongoing applications for additional U.S. government grant funding, highlighting its potential to play a pivotal role in strengthening domestic critical mineral supply chains.

Recognizing the increasing geopolitical risks to global supply chains of critical minerals, the U.S. government has steadily expanded its mandate to build domestic supply chains. Priority has been given to securing U.S. inventories and processing capacity for [50 critical minerals](https://pr.report/5wwa) that have been recognized as being essential to the economy and security of the USA which are currently sourced primarily from other countries. Recent federal initiatives, including the establishment of the [Strategic and Critical Materials Board of Directors](https://pr.report/5wwb) by the Department of Defense (""DoD""), demonstrate bipartisan commitment to addressing supply chain vulnerabilities for listed materials.

Stillwater is uniquely positioned to contribute significantly to U.S. supplies with a world-class inventory of critical minerals in the historically productive Stillwater Complex in Montana. The Company's flagship Stillwater West project in south-central Montana is immediately adjacent to Sibanye-Stillwater's (""Sibanye"") operating mines and processing complex. Mining and processing of critical minerals in the Stillwater district dates back to the 1880s and includes the production of chromium in the 1940s and 50s, at times with government subsidies. At present, Sibanye is the largest global producer of platinum group metals outside Russia and South Africa. Building further on the importance of the Stillwater Complex, the Stillwater West project hosts nine metals that have been listed as critical in the U.S., including the largest nickel resource in an active U.S. mining jurisdiction, along with substantial inventories of copper, cobalt, palladium, platinum, rhodium, and chromium, in addition to as yet unquantified amounts of ruthenium and iridium. As such, Stillwater West is considered by the Company to be central to the strategy of securing domestic supply of critical minerals in the USA and reducing the reliance on foreign imports of these metals.

  
For example, the United States currently has just one operating nickel mine, the Eagle Mine in Michigan. The Eagle Mine produces a small fraction of the nation's nickel consumption and ships concentrate globally due to the absence of nickel processing in the U.S., highlighting the urgent need to develop domestic nickel sources and processing capacity. This challenge is similar for the eight other critical minerals that are hosted at Stillwater West, underscoring the need to advance the project to production to support the growing demand for minerals that are essential to both energy transition and national security.

**Federal Funding Applications and Industry Engagement**

In 2024, the Company achieved a number of important milestones to position itself for additional funding opportunities and further highlight the Company's alignment with federal priorities:

* Submission of a comprehensive white paper titled ""*Expansion of the U.S. Critical Minerals Supply Chain for Nickel, Cobalt, Platinum Group Elements, Copper and Chromium*"".

* Application for funding under [Open Announcement 24-01](https://pr.report/5wwc) from the Defense Industrial Base Consortium (""DIBC""), which focuses on bolstering domestic production of critical minerals. The Department of Defense has released this [Open Announcement through the Defense Industrial Base Consortium Other Transaction Authority](https://pr.report/5wwd) that accepted unsolicited White Papers to be considered for Defense Production Act (""DPA"") Title III and Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment funding. As of November 2024, the Company was notified by the DIBC that the submission was under evaluation.
* Over the past four years, the DoD has invested more than US$870 million via DPA Title III to bolster North American supplies of critical minerals. Title III dates from 1950 and is separate from additional incentives for domestic production in the Inflation Reduction Act.
* Commenced work as the industry partner with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with US$2 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Energy via the Advanced Research Projects Agency program (""ARPA-E""). The grant is in addition to an earlier grant from ARPA-E which was secured in collaboration with Cornell University, for total combined grant funding of US$2.75 million (see news releases August 15, 2024, and February 14, 2023).
* Continued engagement with the U.S. Geological Survey, who have been studying the Stillwater Igneous Complex for decades due to its critical mineral potential as one of the world's largest layered ultramafic complexes.
* Secured a second investment by global mining giant Glencore and strengthened the corporate team with their addition to the Company's board of directors, in addition to Glencore's continued contribution to the Stillwater West technical committee.
* Increased presence and engagement in the local community, as well as key industry organizations including the DIBC, National Mining Association, Montana Mining Association, Montana Chamber of Commerce, and Stillwater County Chamber of Commerce, among others.

Michael Rowley, President and CEO, commented, ""We are very encouraged by the positive reception and shared vision we received in our many meetings with U.S. politicians and government officials in 2024, including Senators and Congressmen from the great state of Montana. The bipartisan support we saw for critical minerals production at our neighbor Sibanye's mine complex was also very encouraging and speaks to the long and prosperous legacy of responsible mining that the Stillwater district is known for. We have applied to the U.S. government for substantial grant funding to accelerate the advancement of Stillwater West to become a cornerstone of U.S. critical mineral supply as the country moves quickly to reduce its dependence on imports.""

1i0d023,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1i0d023/trapped_animal/,Trapped animal,"We were dating for almost 4 years, with 3 of those years living together.

He quit a job he wasn’t satisfied with, and we moved to the main city for better work opportunities. I got a job immediately, but he didn’t—well, he wasn’t even trying. He was sending CVs at the rate of 1 every 2 months, and obviously, he got rejected. I tried to help him find a job. Twice I tried networking through my friends and almost every week I sent him different job opportunities.

Turned out both jobs were “bad,” and all the offers were “beyond his skillset or wierd company""… okay.

When we were searching for a flat, I was the one who did the search and the tours of course the lease agreement was under my name. The rent was paid from my account.

When we moved in together, I told him to arrange the internet connection for us. I waited for more than a month until I ended up managing it myself.

The electricity was also handled by me and paid from my account.

He didn’t send me the money unless I asked, and I always felt bad for asking. Even though he had way more savings (a gift from his mother) than me, somehow, a new MacBook or a Camera (Sony Alfa a7) or new lens was more important than rent.

He stayed at home for almost 3 years, playing Counterstrike and drinking one beer after another. And he claimed to be “depressed.” I found 4 therapists for him near our flat. The first one had a funny name, the second had a weird website, and so on.

He didn’t do any of the household stuff. Laundry, cleaning, cooking—even minor repairs were left to me. Groceries? He didn’t like shopping, so I did that too.

I never got flowers from him, and I don’t recall a single birthday gift.

I always heard, “You’re not a supportive girlfriend.” When I replied, “Hey, I go to work, I do the groceries, I do the cleaning and cooking, and I even tried to find you a job and a therapist—what else I should do to support you?” he’d say, “You’re not giving me the emotional support I need.” Okay…

I hoped it would get better once he found a job, but nothing was happening.

It drove me crazy—to the point where I almost cried at work just seeing a male colleague clean up spilled coffee on the counter after himself.

I went to therapy, and my therapist said: “You know, I think he doesn’t care who stands beside him—whether it’s you, Amy, Lilly, or Anna—as long as the girl is taking care of him.”

That was my final wake-up call. I mean, I already knew I wanted to break up, but this was the eye-opener. I came home and told him I was done, that I couldn’t do this anymore. But it wasn’t a proper breakup.

Suddenly, he started looking for work. He started cleaning and doing the shopping. But I was done.

I cheated. He felt something was odd, but I denied it. Then, a month later, on New Year’s Eve, it came out.

He threw things at me, poured water on my face, spit on me and call me names. But I stayed. It wasn’t enough. I felt like I needed something more—something more harmful, like a slap—to finally walk away.

Then he told me to pack my things and leave.

I ran to my parents’ house and told my dad, feeling bad and guilty, thinking he would lecture me. But suddenly, he said, “Don’t worry. He wasn’t a good guy. It would’ve happened anyway.” I felt relief.

When I told my friends, feeling guilty, all of them said, “Yes, what you did was bad, but he was manipulative all the time, and we’re glad you’re out of it.”

Months after the breakup, I was receiving calls and texts, calling me a wh*re and a b*tch. He told me how much he’d changed, how I didn’t give him a single chance, and how he wanted to propose and have kids. I knew it was a trap.

It has been 2 years since the breakup, and I’ve found a supportive husband. Anyway, this experience is still with me, and I feel bad for cheating.
When I told my husband, he said: “Even a trapped animal will do everything to get out. You were a trapped animal. Don’t worry.”

So where to begin. One of my best friends L (21, female) and her then fiancé C (31, male) were planning their civil wedding in the summer of 2023. L came to me at the time and apologized for not choosing me for the role of maid of honor. We were only friends for 2 years at that time and she had a friend M (39, female) who she had known for 10 years and was like a second mother to her. I wasn't offended and understood that she wanted M as her maid of honor. I was just happy for her an excited that she and C were getting married. Only the closest relatives and the best man and maid of honor were invited to the civil wedding, but a few other friends and I were invited for coffee and cake after the wedding. L told me and everyone else that we would be invited to the church wedding next year. (In our country, church weddings are more important than civil weddings.)  
  
Six months went by and everything was good between L and me. until there was a big argument in our friendship group. Explaining the dispute would go beyond the story. Lets just say that there was radio silence between L and me for about 3 months from that point on.  
  
At that time I got together with my current boyfriend and had a lot of things on my mind, which is why I didn't get together with her. But at some point we ran into each other and I texted her afterwards. I told her that I missed the contact between us and would like to have a discussion so that we can resolve the conflict. After our meeting it was the same as before. We met regularly and texted each other a lot. At that time the hot phase before the church wedding began.  
  
L asked a lot about my opinion about various things for the wedding such as: Hairstyle, make-up, dress, etc.  
The wedding day was getting closer and closer and I was starting to wonder whether I was invited or not. I didn't help as much with the preparations as if everything had been good between us, but I met with the others and the maid of honor to clarify organizational matters such as games after dinner, etc. 

But L still came to me again and again for advice. Then when we met again she said that she would like to have me there on the wedding day but as an evening guest after dinner. She said she hadn't included me in the seating plan because we hadn't spoken at the time and that there were other ""evening"" guests. After the explanation I was a bit disappointed but understood that you couldn't just add guests to a wedding if the food etc. had been paid for.  
  
After a week, L came to me and told me that there seemed to be a conflict with the best man and he said that his parents were very disappointed that they were not invited to the wedding. She then told me that she had invited them afterwards out of a bad conscience.  
  
Now comes the part that let me think the most about our frendship.  
  
After me, the parents of the best man were subsequently invited to the wedding, but not as an evening guest like me, but rather to the entire wedding.This realization hit me hard because she didn't even like the best man's parents and she still had the capacity to invite people to the entire wedding.  
  
But I didn't say anything to L about it. I didn't want to stress her out any more about the wedding.Should I have told her my feelings about it?

  
Anyway, the wedding day came and after dinner I came to the wedding with two other friends who were also there as evening guest. It turned out that we were the only evening guests. We were welcomed there by everyone but there were a lot of side eyes.  
The evening went well except for one or two comments and that L was a bit strange to me that evening and avoided me a bit. Other friends pulled me aside and asked me why I wasn't invited to the rest of the wedding.These comments made me feel even worse than I already felt.  
  
After the wedding L and I had some contact but not like before and I have now distanced myself from her. I'm wondering if I should still broach the subject? I'm also wondering what I should do at my own wedding. Whether I should invite L and C at all.  
  
Am i the a hole for distancing me from L?

I (male, mid-30s) moved into a new place in November. 4 guys, one of whom has been there for 5 years (male, late-30s).

Everything was fine for the first couple of months. The longer term tenant works from home full time as a developer, and I work from home a few days a week. He has quite a large room, mine is smaller.

At lunch, he would come in to the living room/kitchen and make his lunch. This was absolutely fine. He sometimes asked to use the coffee table, which I also didn't mind and we would chat a bit. He wasn't ""nice"" but he also wasn't unfriendly.

He went on holiday over Christmas and New Year. When he came back, I was in the living room for about half an hour, having been ill in my room all day.

He ""told"" me that I was not allowed to use the living room to work. I pushed back on that. He visibly shook (I now know, with rage rather than anxiety about confronting me). He then said, that as a compromise, I was to leave the living room when he had his lunch - I was to be ""banished"" from there from 12-1pm

I contacted my landlord and asked her about this and she said I could be in the living room whenever I wanted and that he couldn't tell me where I could go. She said she called him to confirm this and that he had said that I can use the room whenever I wanted (all innocent, the psycho).

The next day, I was working from there. I had a work call at 11.30. he came in around the start of my call and started making his lunch. At 11.58, I was still on my call and he aggressively put down his bowl of food on the coffee table and looked at me like a feral dog. My colleagues saw this bit over Teams.

He then slammed my laptop closed. I said ""what the fuck?"" He then punched me in the temple/the top of my jaw.

I left the room, contacted my landlord and called the police. The police came round and we chatted. They spoke to him and he admitted to it. The police informed him that it was a criminal offence. They told me he claimed it was in the heat of the moment, and that I provoked him by swearing. His details would be kept on file and that I should call if it happens again. 

Typical lazy police response. But they did speak to my landlord to confirm our accounts. 

My landlord (who has been great) told me she was going to evict him. I believe in this situation, she can serve him two weeks notice? She made sure that I was out of the house while she called. She then handed him a written notice the next day. She said that because he'd been there for so long, he had become territorial. Her reaction does make me think he's behaved in a threatening manner before.

He is packing his stuff and apparently moving out in a couple of days.

I have been threatened by a housemate in a previous place. How common is this? Why does it keep happening?

1i0cs5u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i0cs5u,Update on the $180 bankruptcy score,"With the auction description only saying ”coffee machine + grinder”, it was kind of a gamble without knowing the condition of the units and if any tools would come with it. 

Opening the box as I was in an episode of Garage Hunters, I found portafilters, tamper and even cups! 

On the first look, the machine looked like it been unused for quite a while. Having some difficulties priming the unit at start resolved after cleaning the unit and all internal parts throughout. The machine looked like it never been cleaned, ever. 

After getting to work, I noticed the steam wand wasn’t working. After taking the head of the steam wand off, I could see it was clogged up with old milk and after some cleaning — voila, works like a charm.

I noticed that the pressure gauge was damaged so I’ve already ordered a spare part but that didn’t stop me from wanting to try the machine out. 

During the heating phase I turn to the grinder that also followed the auction was as some guessed — a Fiorenzato T80.

With no previous experience (only had like 100 espressos), I poured some newly purchased beans into the grinder and it works!

Measured about 20g and poured it into the portafilter, tamper it, lock it to the machine and I’ve happily made my first ever espresso in life.

The neon sign outside read ""Martin's Deli,"" a bright beacon against the fading twilight of Los Angeles. The smell of grilled meats and melted cheese wafted through the air, mingling with the faint hint of the Pacific breeze. Inside, the small paninoteca was bustling with the usual evening crowd—locals grabbing a quick bite after work, friends catching up over sandwiches, and the occasional late-night wanderer lured by the savory aromas.

Martin, the owner and head chef, was behind the counter, his hands deftly assembling a towering panino, layers of prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, and arugula spilling out from between the toasted ciabatta. His face was a mix of concentration and joy; he loved this place, this rhythm of service, and the community it fostered. 

George, his right-hand man, was busy at the grill, flipping patties and checking on the fries, his laughter ringing out as he joked with the customers. The two men had been friends since childhood, their bond forged in the kitchens of their mothers and the streets of their neighborhood.

Lena, the newest addition to the team, was sweeping the floor, her eyes darting around as she took in the lively atmosphere. She had recently moved to LA, chasing dreams of stardom but finding herself drawn to the warmth of the deli. There was something about the place that felt like home, even if it was just a temporary stop on her journey.

As the dinner rush began to settle, Martin wiped his brow and turned to George. “Hey, did you see the guy who came in earlier? The one in the leather jacket?” 

George shrugged, flipping a burger. “Yeah, he seemed a little off. Why?”

“He ordered a sandwich and paid in cash, but he kept looking over his shoulder. I don’t like the vibe.”

Lena, overhearing their conversation, leaned in. “Should we be concerned? It’s a deli, not a crime scene.”

Martin chuckled but his expression was serious. “In this city, you never know. Just keep an eye out, okay?”

As the night wore on, the crowd began to thin, and the familiar sounds of the grill and the chatter of the few remaining customers filled the air. But just as Martin was about to close up for the night, the door swung open with a clang, and in walked the man in the leather jacket.

His presence was commanding, and the laughter in the deli quieted as he scanned the room. Martin felt a chill run down his spine. The man approached the counter, his eyes narrowing as they locked onto Martin’s.

“I need to talk to you,” the man said, his voice low and gravelly.

“Sorry, we’re closing,” Martin replied, trying to keep his tone steady.

The man leaned in closer, his breath heavy with the scent of cigarette smoke. “This isn’t a request.”

Before Martin could respond, George stepped forward, a protective stance taking over. “Hey, buddy, you need to back off.”

The man’s gaze shifted to George, and for a moment, the tension in the room crackled like static electricity. Lena stood frozen, her heart racing, sensing that something was about to unfold.

“Just a simple conversation,” the man said, his smile not reaching his eyes. “You know something you shouldn’t.”

Martin’s mind raced. What did this man know? And why did he feel like this was just the beginning of something much darker?

As the clock ticked towards midnight, the city outside buzzed with life, unaware of the storm brewing within the walls of Martin’s Deli. Secrets simmered beneath the surface, and in a city where dreams and nightmares often collided, this was one meal that was about to turn sour.### Chapter 2: Unraveling Threads

The tension in the deli thickened like the steam rising from the grill. Martin’s heart raced as he tried to gauge the man’s intentions. He could feel George’s protective energy beside him, but the uncertainty of the situation gnawed at him.

“Look, I don’t know what you think you know,” Martin said, keeping his voice steady. “But this is just a sandwich shop. We don’t want any trouble.”

The man chuckled, a low, menacing sound that sent a shiver down Lena’s spine. “Oh, but you’re mistaken, my friend. This isn’t just a sandwich shop. It’s a crossroads. And you, Martin, are at the center of it.”

George stepped forward, his fists clenched. “You need to leave. Now.”

The man’s eyes flicked to George, assessing, then returned to Martin. “You’re smarter than you look. I respect that. But you’re in way over your head. I’m giving you a chance to come clean.”

Martin exchanged a glance with George, who nodded slightly. They had been through a lot together, but this felt different. He was about to respond when Lena, unable to contain her curiosity any longer, spoke up.

“Why don’t you tell us what you’re talking about?” she asked, her voice shaking but defiant. “What do you want with Martin?”

The man turned to her, his expression softening momentarily, as if he hadn’t expected her to speak. “You’re brave, I’ll give you that. But bravery can be a dangerous game in this city.”

“Enough with the riddles,” George said, his voice firm. “What do you want?”

The man leaned closer, lowering his voice. “I want to know where the packages went.”

Martin’s stomach dropped. He had heard whispers about shipments and deals, but he never thought they would touch his little deli. “What packages?” he asked, feigning ignorance even as fear coursed through him.

“Don’t play dumb with me,” the man hissed. “I know you’re involved. You’ve been acting as a front, haven’t you? It’s clever, using a deli to mask the real business. But it’s time to choose a side.”

Lena’s eyes widened. “What are you talking about? We don’t know anything about any business!”

“Maybe not yet,” the man said, straightening up. “But you’re in this deeper than you realize. Just remember, Martin, I’ll be watching. And if you want to stay out of trouble, you should think about what I said.”

With that, the man turned on his heel and strode out of the deli, the door slamming shut behind him. The three of them stood in a stunned silence, the weight of what had just transpired settling heavily in the air.

“What the hell was that?” George finally exclaimed, his voice rising in disbelief. “Packages? What does he mean?”

“I don’t know,” Martin replied, his mind racing as he tried to piece together the fragments of the encounter. “But we need to figure this out. We can’t let this guy think we’re involved in something we’re not.”

Lena, still shaken, spoke up. “What if he’s right? What if we are in over our heads? This isn’t just about sandwiches anymore.”

Martin took a deep breath, his resolve hardening. “We’ll find out what’s really going on. We need to dig deeper. If there’s something hidden here, we can’t just sit back and let it come to us.”

George nodded, his expression serious. “So what’s our first step?”

Martin glanced around the deli, feeling the weight of the walls closing in. “We need to check the back storage area. If there’s anything suspicious, that’s where it will be. And we need to do it now, before he comes back.”

The three of them moved cautiously toward the back of the deli, adrenaline coursing through their veins. As they approached the storage area, Martin felt a mix of determination and dread. Whatever secrets lay hidden in the shadows of Martin’s Deli were about to be uncovered, and there was no turning back now.

They pushed open the door to the storage room, the flickering fluorescent lights casting eerie shadows on the shelves stacked high with supplies. But as they stepped inside, a sense of foreboding filled the air. It was time to confront the truth, no matter how dangerous it might be.### Chapter 3: Shadows in the Back

The storage room was dimly lit, the fluorescent lights buzzing like angry bees overhead. Shelves lined the walls, crammed with boxes of bread, bags of flour, and jars of condiments. But as Martin scanned the space, his eyes landed on a corner that felt out of place—an area shrouded in darkness, tucked away behind a stack of crates.

“Over there,” Martin whispered, pointing towards the shadows. George and Lena exchanged nervous glances but nodded, their collective instincts urging them forward.

As they approached, Martin’s heart raced. What were they about to uncover? He reached for the nearest crate and began to move it aside, revealing a small door that had been partially hidden from view. Its surface was worn, and the handle was cold to the touch.

“Is this even part of the deli?” Lena asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

“I don’t know,” Martin replied, his curiosity piqued. “But it’s time we find out.”

With a deep breath, he turned the handle and pushed the door open. It creaked ominously, revealing a narrow staircase leading down into darkness. The air was musty, and the sound of dripping water echoed from below.

“Should we really go down there?” George asked, hesitating at the top of the stairs.

“We have to,” Martin said firmly. “If there’s something happening here that we don’t know about, we need to uncover it. For our safety—and for the deli.”

Lena nodded, determination flickering in her eyes. “Let’s do it.”

With George leading the way, the three of them descended the staircase, each step heavy with anticipation. The air grew cooler, and the faint light from above quickly faded, leaving them in near darkness. Martin pulled out his phone, using the flashlight to illuminate their path as they reached the bottom.

They found themselves in a small, dimly lit basement. The space was cluttered with old equipment, discarded boxes, and a few crates that looked newer than the rest. But what caught Martin's eye was a large table in the center of the room, covered with documents and scattered items.

“What is all this?” George asked, stepping closer to the table. 

Martin moved to the table, his mind racing as he scanned the papers. Some were invoices, while others seemed to be shipping documents. His stomach sank as he read a few familiar names—names associated with less than reputable dealings in Los Angeles.

“Looks like a distribution list,” he murmured, his voice thick with disbelief. “And these… these are addresses. They’re not just sandwiches being shipped out of here.”

Lena leaned over, her eyes wide. “Martin, this is serious. What if he’s right? What if we’ve been unknowingly involved in something illegal?”

Before Martin could respond, a noise echoed from above—the unmistakable sound of footsteps. George’s eyes widened in alarm. “We need to get out of here. Now.”

They quickly moved to the staircase, but Martin hesitated. “Wait! We can’t just leave this behind. We need proof.”

“Proof of what?” George hissed, glancing nervously at the stairs. “That we’ve got a secret drug operation in our deli? Are you crazy?”

“Just give me a minute,” Martin replied, rummaging through the papers. He grabbed a few documents, focusing on the addresses and names that seemed most relevant. 

Lena, glancing back toward the staircase, said, “Hurry! We can’t stay here.”

Just as Martin stuffed the papers into his bag, the footsteps grew louder, and a shadow fell across the top of the stairs. Panic surged through him. They had to act quickly.

“Go!” he shouted, and they scrambled back up the stairs, adrenaline pushing them forward.

As they burst into the storage room, Martin's heart sank. The front door swung open, and in stepped the man in the leather jacket, flanked by two others. The atmosphere shifted instantly, the air charged with danger.

“Thought you could hide from me?” the man sneered, his eyes glinting with malice. “You should’ve stayed away from things that don’t concern you.”

George moved to shield Lena, but Martin stepped forward, defiance fueling his voice. “You don’t know what we’ve found. We’re not afraid of you.”

The man laughed, a hollow sound that echoed in the small space. “Brave words for someone who’s already in over his head. You have no idea who you’re dealing with.”

Lena, trembling but resolute, whispered to Martin, “What do we do?”

In that moment, Martin felt a mix of fear and determination. They had uncovered something dangerous, and now it was time to confront it head-on. “We fight for our deli. We fight for our lives.”

With a swift movement, Martin grabbed a nearby crate and hurled it toward the man, hoping to create a distraction. Chaos erupted as the crate crashed to the ground, sending papers flying and the group scattering.

“Run!” Martin shouted, and the three of them dashed for the exit, adrenaline pumping through their veins as they raced against time and the danger closing in around them. 

The deli was their sanctuary, but now it felt like a battleground. The stakes had never been higher, and the shadows of their past were catching up to them. If they wanted to survive, they had to uncover the truth—before it was too late.### Chapter 4: Into the Fray

They burst through the front door of Martin’s Deli, the cool night air hitting their faces like a splash of cold water. Martin glanced back at the deli, heart pounding. The man in the leather jacket and his accomplices were still inside, but they didn’t have time to think about that now. They had to get somewhere safe.

“Where do we go?” Lena asked, her voice trembling as they ran down the street, the neon lights of the deli flickering behind them.

“Back to my apartment,” Martin replied, urgency lacing his words. “It’s not far, and it’ll give us a place to regroup.”

George nodded, keeping an eye on the street behind them. “Let’s move. We can’t let them catch up.”

They sprinted down the sidewalk, the familiar sights of Los Angeles blurring past them. The streets were alive with the sounds of cars honking and distant music, but all Martin could hear was the pounding of his heart and the realization that their lives had just taken a turn into darkness.

As they turned a corner, Martin led them into an alley. The shadows felt suffocating, but it was better than being out in the open. They slowed, catching their breath, and Martin pulled out his phone.

“Do you think we should call the police?” Lena asked, her eyes wide with fear.

“Not yet,” Martin replied, glancing at George. “If we go to the cops now, they might think we’re involved. We need to figure out what’s really going on first.”

George leaned against the wall, trying to catch his breath. “So what’s our plan? We can’t just sit here and wait.”

“I need to look at those documents again,” Martin said, determination setting in. “There might be something we can use. If we can find out who’s behind this, we can make a case. But we need to be careful.”

“Agreed,” George said, standing up straighter. “Let’s get to your apartment and figure this out.”

They emerged from the alley and made their way to Martin’s apartment, a small unit on the second floor of an old building. As they climbed the stairs, anxiety clawed at Martin’s insides. What if the man in the leather jacket had followed them? What if they were walking straight into a trap?

Once inside, Martin locked the door and pulled the curtains shut. The dim light from a single bulb illuminated the cramped space filled with mismatched furniture and the lingering scent of stale coffee. They huddled around the small table, the papers from the storage room spread out before them.

“Okay, let’s see what we’ve got,” Martin said, his fingers trembling slightly as he sifted through the documents. “We need to find anything that can help us identify who’s behind this.”

Lena leaned in, scanning the papers. “These addresses… they look like they’re spread all over the city. What if these are just drop points?”

“Exactly,” Martin replied, piecing together the puzzle. “If we can connect these addresses to a bigger operation, we might be able to figure out who’s running it.”

George flipped through the documents, his brow furrowed in concentration. “What about this one?” He pointed at a name listed on an invoice. “This guy has a reputation. I’ve heard whispers about him in the neighborhood—deals gone bad, people disappearing.”

Lena looked up, her face pale. “You mean he’s dangerous?”

“Very,” George confirmed, his voice serious. “If he’s involved, we’re in deeper trouble than we thought.”

Martin’s mind raced. They needed to act fast. “We can’t let this go. If we report this to the right people, we might be able to expose whatever’s happening. But we need evidence—something solid.”

“Then we should check out one of these addresses,” George suggested. “See if we can gather more information.”

Lena hesitated. “But what if they’re watching? What if they know we’re onto them?”

“Then we have to be smart about it,” Martin said, determination burning in his chest. “We move quickly and quietly. We can split up to cover more ground.”

George nodded. “I’ll take one of the addresses. It looks like a warehouse. You two can check out the other one—it’s a small storage facility.”

Lena bit her lip. “What if something goes wrong?”

Martin met her gaze, his expression firm. “We have to be brave. We can’t let fear control us. We’ll stick to our phones and check in regularly. If anything feels off, we bail. Agreed?”

“Agreed,” George and Lena said in unison, a newfound sense of resolve settling over them.

As they gathered their things, Martin felt a rush of adrenaline. They were stepping into the unknown, but they were also taking control of their lives again. Whatever shadows lurked in the city tonight, they wouldn’t face them alone.

With one last look around the apartment, Martin led the way out, locking the door behind them. The night was waiting, and the answers they sought were just beyond the darkness. They were about to plunge deeper into a world of secrets and danger, and there was no turning back now.### Chapter 5: The Warehouse

The streets of Los Angeles pulsed with life, but for Martin, Lena, and George, the vibrant city felt like a backdrop to a dark film. As they moved towards their separate destinations, the weight of their mission hung heavily on their shoulders. Each step felt like a step into the unknown, and the thrill of danger coursed through their veins.

Martin and Lena arrived at a nondescript storage facility nestled between two larger buildings. The exterior was unremarkable—gray concrete, rusting metal doors, and a flickering overhead light that gave off a dull glow. Martin felt a knot tighten in his stomach. This was it. They were about to confront something that could change their lives forever.

“Are you ready?” Martin asked, glancing at Lena, who was taking deep breaths to steady her nerves.

“As ready as I’ll ever be,” she replied, her voice steadying. “Let’s just be careful.”

They approached the entrance, a large metal door that seemed to loom over them. Martin pulled out his phone to check the time; it was just after 10 PM. The facility was quiet, save for the distant hum of traffic. He glanced around, making sure no one was watching. 

“Okay, let’s see if it’s unlocked,” he said, testing the door handle. To his surprise, it turned easily, and the door creaked open. 

Inside, the air was stale, thick with dust and the faint scent of industrial cleaner. Martin turned on his phone’s flashlight, illuminating a narrow corridor lined with storage units. The walls were adorned with peeling paint and faded signage. 

“This place gives me the creeps,” Lena whispered, her voice echoing slightly in the silence. “Are you sure we should be here?”

“We need to find out what’s happening,” Martin replied, resolve hardening his voice. “We can’t turn back now.” 

They moved cautiously down the corridor, the beam of light from Martin’s phone cutting through the darkness. They paused at the first unit, marked with a faded number. Martin hesitated, then gently pulled the door open. It screeched on its hinges, and they both flinched.

Inside, the unit was empty, save for a few scattered boxes and a thick layer of dust. “Nothing here,” Martin muttered, his heart sinking. 

They continued down the row, checking each unit. Most were empty or filled with old furniture, but as they reached the end of the corridor, a faint sound caught Martin's attention—a muffled conversation coming from somewhere deeper within the facility.

“Did you hear that?” he whispered to Lena. She nodded, her eyes wide with fear.

“Let’s go check it out,” Martin said, his heart racing. They crept toward the source of the sound, which seemed to be coming from a larger unit at the far end.

As they approached, Martin could make out distinct voices—two men arguing heatedly. He pressed his ear against the door, straining to catch snippets of the conversation.

“...told you it was a bad idea!” one voice hissed, filled with frustration. “Now they’re onto us!”

“We can handle it. We just need to keep the shipments moving,” the other replied, calmer but with an underlying edge of menace. “We can’t let anyone find out.”

Martin exchanged a glance with Lena. They needed to know more, but how? 

“Should we go in?” Lena whispered, her voice barely audible.

“No,” Martin replied, his mind racing. “We need to find out what they’re planning without getting caught. Let’s see if we can find a way to listen in without being seen.”

They stepped back and scanned the corridor for any other openings. Martin spotted a small window near the top of the unit’s wall. “If we can climb up and look through, we might be able to see what’s happening inside.”

“Are you sure that’s a good idea?” Lena asked, concern etched on her face. “What if they see us?”

“We’ll be quick,” Martin assured her. “We need this information.”

Together, they managed to find a stack of old crates nearby, using them to climb up to the window. Martin hoisted himself up first, peering through the grimy glass. The view inside was partially obscured, but he could make out the two men standing beside a table cluttered with packages.

“Look!” Martin whispered urgently, signaling for Lena to join him.

She climbed up next to him, her breath hitching as she focused on the scene inside. The two men were now rifling through boxes, pulling out neatly packed bags that glimmered under the dim light.

“Is that…?” Lena began, but Martin nodded, understanding her unspoken words. It was what they had feared—drugs, being processed and prepared for distribution.

“Looks like we were right,” Martin murmured, his heart pounding. “This is a major operation.”

As they continued to watch, one of the men pulled out a phone and spoke into it, his tone urgent. “We need to move the product tonight. I don’t care what it takes. If anyone gets in our way, deal with them. We can’t afford any mistakes.”

Lena’s eyes widened in horror. “Did you hear that? They’re not just dealing drugs; they’re threatening people!”

Martin felt a surge of adrenaline and fear. “We need to get this evidence back to George and figure out our next move. But we have to be careful. If they see us leaving…”

Before he could finish, the door to the unit swung open, and one of the men stepped out, glancing around suspiciously. Martin and Lena froze, hearts racing as they pressed themselves against the wall, barely breathing.

The man took a few steps down the corridor, scanning the area. “What was that?” he muttered to himself, his eyes narrowing.

Lena’s grip tightened around Martin’s arm, and he could feel the tension in the air. They had to act fast.

“Let’s go,” he whispered urgently, and they scrambled down from the crates, hearts pounding in sync with their footsteps as they moved quickly but quietly back toward the entrance.

They could feel the weight of danger closing in around them, and as they reached the door, Martin glanced back, knowing this was just the beginning. They had uncovered something monumental, but now they had to get out alive—and fast.",1,1736770732.0,ebooksforfree,0,1.0,False

The neon sign outside read ""Martin's Deli,"" a bright beacon against the fading twilight of Los Angeles. The smell of grilled meats and melted cheese wafted through the air, mingling with the faint hint of the Pacific breeze. Inside, the small paninoteca was bustling with the usual evening crowd—locals grabbing a quick bite after work, friends catching up over sandwiches, and the occasional late-night wanderer lured by the savory aromas.

Martin, the owner and head chef, was behind the counter, his hands deftly assembling a towering panino, layers of prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, and arugula spilling out from between the toasted ciabatta. His face was a mix of concentration and joy; he loved this place, this rhythm of service, and the community it fostered. 

George, his right-hand man, was busy at the grill, flipping patties and checking on the fries, his laughter ringing out as he joked with the customers. The two men had been friends since childhood, their bond forged in the kitchens of their mothers and the streets of their neighborhood.

Lena, the newest addition to the team, was sweeping the floor, her eyes darting around as she took in the lively atmosphere. She had recently moved to LA, chasing dreams of stardom but finding herself drawn to the warmth of the deli. There was something about the place that felt like home, even if it was just a temporary stop on her journey.

As the dinner rush began to settle, Martin wiped his brow and turned to George. “Hey, did you see the guy who came in earlier? The one in the leather jacket?” 

George shrugged, flipping a burger. “Yeah, he seemed a little off. Why?”

“He ordered a sandwich and paid in cash, but he kept looking over his shoulder. I don’t like the vibe.”

Lena, overhearing their conversation, leaned in. “Should we be concerned? It’s a deli, not a crime scene.”

Martin chuckled but his expression was serious. “In this city, you never know. Just keep an eye out, okay?”

As the night wore on, the crowd began to thin, and the familiar sounds of the grill and the chatter of the few remaining customers filled the air. But just as Martin was about to close up for the night, the door swung open with a clang, and in walked the man in the leather jacket.

His presence was commanding, and the laughter in the deli quieted as he scanned the room. Martin felt a chill run down his spine. The man approached the counter, his eyes narrowing as they locked onto Martin’s.

“I need to talk to you,” the man said, his voice low and gravelly.

“Sorry, we’re closing,” Martin replied, trying to keep his tone steady.

The man leaned in closer, his breath heavy with the scent of cigarette smoke. “This isn’t a request.”

Before Martin could respond, George stepped forward, a protective stance taking over. “Hey, buddy, you need to back off.”

The man’s gaze shifted to George, and for a moment, the tension in the room crackled like static electricity. Lena stood frozen, her heart racing, sensing that something was about to unfold.

“Just a simple conversation,” the man said, his smile not reaching his eyes. “You know something you shouldn’t.”

Martin’s mind raced. What did this man know? And why did he feel like this was just the beginning of something much darker?

As the clock ticked towards midnight, the city outside buzzed with life, unaware of the storm brewing within the walls of Martin’s Deli. Secrets simmered beneath the surface, and in a city where dreams and nightmares often collided, this was one meal that was about to turn sour.### Chapter 2: Unraveling Threads

The tension in the deli thickened like the steam rising from the grill. Martin’s heart raced as he tried to gauge the man’s intentions. He could feel George’s protective energy beside him, but the uncertainty of the situation gnawed at him.

“Look, I don’t know what you think you know,” Martin said, keeping his voice steady. “But this is just a sandwich shop. We don’t want any trouble.”

The man chuckled, a low, menacing sound that sent a shiver down Lena’s spine. “Oh, but you’re mistaken, my friend. This isn’t just a sandwich shop. It’s a crossroads. And you, Martin, are at the center of it.”

George stepped forward, his fists clenched. “You need to leave. Now.”

The man’s eyes flicked to George, assessing, then returned to Martin. “You’re smarter than you look. I respect that. But you’re in way over your head. I’m giving you a chance to come clean.”

Martin exchanged a glance with George, who nodded slightly. They had been through a lot together, but this felt different. He was about to respond when Lena, unable to contain her curiosity any longer, spoke up.

“Why don’t you tell us what you’re talking about?” she asked, her voice shaking but defiant. “What do you want with Martin?”

The man turned to her, his expression softening momentarily, as if he hadn’t expected her to speak. “You’re brave, I’ll give you that. But bravery can be a dangerous game in this city.”

“Enough with the riddles,” George said, his voice firm. “What do you want?”

The man leaned closer, lowering his voice. “I want to know where the packages went.”

Martin’s stomach dropped. He had heard whispers about shipments and deals, but he never thought they would touch his little deli. “What packages?” he asked, feigning ignorance even as fear coursed through him.

“Don’t play dumb with me,” the man hissed. “I know you’re involved. You’ve been acting as a front, haven’t you? It’s clever, using a deli to mask the real business. But it’s time to choose a side.”

Lena’s eyes widened. “What are you talking about? We don’t know anything about any business!”

“Maybe not yet,” the man said, straightening up. “But you’re in this deeper than you realize. Just remember, Martin, I’ll be watching. And if you want to stay out of trouble, you should think about what I said.”

With that, the man turned on his heel and strode out of the deli, the door slamming shut behind him. The three of them stood in a stunned silence, the weight of what had just transpired settling heavily in the air.

“What the hell was that?” George finally exclaimed, his voice rising in disbelief. “Packages? What does he mean?”

“I don’t know,” Martin replied, his mind racing as he tried to piece together the fragments of the encounter. “But we need to figure this out. We can’t let this guy think we’re involved in something we’re not.”

Lena, still shaken, spoke up. “What if he’s right? What if we are in over our heads? This isn’t just about sandwiches anymore.”

Martin took a deep breath, his resolve hardening. “We’ll find out what’s really going on. We need to dig deeper. If there’s something hidden here, we can’t just sit back and let it come to us.”

George nodded, his expression serious. “So what’s our first step?”

Martin glanced around the deli, feeling the weight of the walls closing in. “We need to check the back storage area. If there’s anything suspicious, that’s where it will be. And we need to do it now, before he comes back.”

The three of them moved cautiously toward the back of the deli, adrenaline coursing through their veins. As they approached the storage area, Martin felt a mix of determination and dread. Whatever secrets lay hidden in the shadows of Martin’s Deli were about to be uncovered, and there was no turning back now.

They pushed open the door to the storage room, the flickering fluorescent lights casting eerie shadows on the shelves stacked high with supplies. But as they stepped inside, a sense of foreboding filled the air. It was time to confront the truth, no matter how dangerous it might be.### Chapter 3: Shadows in the Back

The storage room was dimly lit, the fluorescent lights buzzing like angry bees overhead. Shelves lined the walls, crammed with boxes of bread, bags of flour, and jars of condiments. But as Martin scanned the space, his eyes landed on a corner that felt out of place—an area shrouded in darkness, tucked away behind a stack of crates.

“Over there,” Martin whispered, pointing towards the shadows. George and Lena exchanged nervous glances but nodded, their collective instincts urging them forward.

As they approached, Martin’s heart raced. What were they about to uncover? He reached for the nearest crate and began to move it aside, revealing a small door that had been partially hidden from view. Its surface was worn, and the handle was cold to the touch.

“Is this even part of the deli?” Lena asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

“I don’t know,” Martin replied, his curiosity piqued. “But it’s time we find out.”

With a deep breath, he turned the handle and pushed the door open. It creaked ominously, revealing a narrow staircase leading down into darkness. The air was musty, and the sound of dripping water echoed from below.

“Should we really go down there?” George asked, hesitating at the top of the stairs.

“We have to,” Martin said firmly. “If there’s something happening here that we don’t know about, we need to uncover it. For our safety—and for the deli.”

Lena nodded, determination flickering in her eyes. “Let’s do it.”

With George leading the way, the three of them descended the staircase, each step heavy with anticipation. The air grew cooler, and the faint light from above quickly faded, leaving them in near darkness. Martin pulled out his phone, using the flashlight to illuminate their path as they reached the bottom.

They found themselves in a small, dimly lit basement. The space was cluttered with old equipment, discarded boxes, and a few crates that looked newer than the rest. But what caught Martin's eye was a large table in the center of the room, covered with documents and scattered items.

“What is all this?” George asked, stepping closer to the table. 

Martin moved to the table, his mind racing as he scanned the papers. Some were invoices, while others seemed to be shipping documents. His stomach sank as he read a few familiar names—names associated with less than reputable dealings in Los Angeles.

“Looks like a distribution list,” he murmured, his voice thick with disbelief. “And these… these are addresses. They’re not just sandwiches being shipped out of here.”

Lena leaned over, her eyes wide. “Martin, this is serious. What if he’s right? What if we’ve been unknowingly involved in something illegal?”

Before Martin could respond, a noise echoed from above—the unmistakable sound of footsteps. George’s eyes widened in alarm. “We need to get out of here. Now.”

They quickly moved to the staircase, but Martin hesitated. “Wait! We can’t just leave this behind. We need proof.”

“Proof of what?” George hissed, glancing nervously at the stairs. “That we’ve got a secret drug operation in our deli? Are you crazy?”

“Just give me a minute,” Martin replied, rummaging through the papers. He grabbed a few documents, focusing on the addresses and names that seemed most relevant. 

Lena, glancing back toward the staircase, said, “Hurry! We can’t stay here.”

Just as Martin stuffed the papers into his bag, the footsteps grew louder, and a shadow fell across the top of the stairs. Panic surged through him. They had to act quickly.

“Go!” he shouted, and they scrambled back up the stairs, adrenaline pushing them forward.

As they burst into the storage room, Martin's heart sank. The front door swung open, and in stepped the man in the leather jacket, flanked by two others. The atmosphere shifted instantly, the air charged with danger.

“Thought you could hide from me?” the man sneered, his eyes glinting with malice. “You should’ve stayed away from things that don’t concern you.”

George moved to shield Lena, but Martin stepped forward, defiance fueling his voice. “You don’t know what we’ve found. We’re not afraid of you.”

The man laughed, a hollow sound that echoed in the small space. “Brave words for someone who’s already in over his head. You have no idea who you’re dealing with.”

Lena, trembling but resolute, whispered to Martin, “What do we do?”

In that moment, Martin felt a mix of fear and determination. They had uncovered something dangerous, and now it was time to confront it head-on. “We fight for our deli. We fight for our lives.”

With a swift movement, Martin grabbed a nearby crate and hurled it toward the man, hoping to create a distraction. Chaos erupted as the crate crashed to the ground, sending papers flying and the group scattering.

“Run!” Martin shouted, and the three of them dashed for the exit, adrenaline pumping through their veins as they raced against time and the danger closing in around them. 

The deli was their sanctuary, but now it felt like a battleground. The stakes had never been higher, and the shadows of their past were catching up to them. If they wanted to survive, they had to uncover the truth—before it was too late.### Chapter 4: Into the Fray

They burst through the front door of Martin’s Deli, the cool night air hitting their faces like a splash of cold water. Martin glanced back at the deli, heart pounding. The man in the leather jacket and his accomplices were still inside, but they didn’t have time to think about that now. They had to get somewhere safe.

“Where do we go?” Lena asked, her voice trembling as they ran down the street, the neon lights of the deli flickering behind them.

“Back to my apartment,” Martin replied, urgency lacing his words. “It’s not far, and it’ll give us a place to regroup.”

George nodded, keeping an eye on the street behind them. “Let’s move. We can’t let them catch up.”

They sprinted down the sidewalk, the familiar sights of Los Angeles blurring past them. The streets were alive with the sounds of cars honking and distant music, but all Martin could hear was the pounding of his heart and the realization that their lives had just taken a turn into darkness.

As they turned a corner, Martin led them into an alley. The shadows felt suffocating, but it was better than being out in the open. They slowed, catching their breath, and Martin pulled out his phone.

“Do you think we should call the police?” Lena asked, her eyes wide with fear.

“Not yet,” Martin replied, glancing at George. “If we go to the cops now, they might think we’re involved. We need to figure out what’s really going on first.”

George leaned against the wall, trying to catch his breath. “So what’s our plan? We can’t just sit here and wait.”

“I need to look at those documents again,” Martin said, determination setting in. “There might be something we can use. If we can find out who’s behind this, we can make a case. But we need to be careful.”

“Agreed,” George said, standing up straighter. “Let’s get to your apartment and figure this out.”

They emerged from the alley and made their way to Martin’s apartment, a small unit on the second floor of an old building. As they climbed the stairs, anxiety clawed at Martin’s insides. What if the man in the leather jacket had followed them? What if they were walking straight into a trap?

Once inside, Martin locked the door and pulled the curtains shut. The dim light from a single bulb illuminated the cramped space filled with mismatched furniture and the lingering scent of stale coffee. They huddled around the small table, the papers from the storage room spread out before them.

“Okay, let’s see what we’ve got,” Martin said, his fingers trembling slightly as he sifted through the documents. “We need to find anything that can help us identify who’s behind this.”

Lena leaned in, scanning the papers. “These addresses… they look like they’re spread all over the city. What if these are just drop points?”

“Exactly,” Martin replied, piecing together the puzzle. “If we can connect these addresses to a bigger operation, we might be able to figure out who’s running it.”

George flipped through the documents, his brow furrowed in concentration. “What about this one?” He pointed at a name listed on an invoice. “This guy has a reputation. I’ve heard whispers about him in the neighborhood—deals gone bad, people disappearing.”

Lena looked up, her face pale. “You mean he’s dangerous?”

“Very,” George confirmed, his voice serious. “If he’s involved, we’re in deeper trouble than we thought.”

Martin’s mind raced. They needed to act fast. “We can’t let this go. If we report this to the right people, we might be able to expose whatever’s happening. But we need evidence—something solid.”

“Then we should check out one of these addresses,” George suggested. “See if we can gather more information.”

Lena hesitated. “But what if they’re watching? What if they know we’re onto them?”

“Then we have to be smart about it,” Martin said, determination burning in his chest. “We move quickly and quietly. We can split up to cover more ground.”

George nodded. “I’ll take one of the addresses. It looks like a warehouse. You two can check out the other one—it’s a small storage facility.”

Lena bit her lip. “What if something goes wrong?”

Martin met her gaze, his expression firm. “We have to be brave. We can’t let fear control us. We’ll stick to our phones and check in regularly. If anything feels off, we bail. Agreed?”

“Agreed,” George and Lena said in unison, a newfound sense of resolve settling over them.

As they gathered their things, Martin felt a rush of adrenaline. They were stepping into the unknown, but they were also taking control of their lives again. Whatever shadows lurked in the city tonight, they wouldn’t face them alone.

With one last look around the apartment, Martin led the way out, locking the door behind them. The night was waiting, and the answers they sought were just beyond the darkness. They were about to plunge deeper into a world of secrets and danger, and there was no turning back now.### Chapter 5: The Warehouse

The streets of Los Angeles pulsed with life, but for Martin, Lena, and George, the vibrant city felt like a backdrop to a dark film. As they moved towards their separate destinations, the weight of their mission hung heavily on their shoulders. Each step felt like a step into the unknown, and the thrill of danger coursed through their veins.

Martin and Lena arrived at a nondescript storage facility nestled between two larger buildings. The exterior was unremarkable—gray concrete, rusting metal doors, and a flickering overhead light that gave off a dull glow. Martin felt a knot tighten in his stomach. This was it. They were about to confront something that could change their lives forever.

“Are you ready?” Martin asked, glancing at Lena, who was taking deep breaths to steady her nerves.

“As ready as I’ll ever be,” she replied, her voice steadying. “Let’s just be careful.”

They approached the entrance, a large metal door that seemed to loom over them. Martin pulled out his phone to check the time; it was just after 10 PM. The facility was quiet, save for the distant hum of traffic. He glanced around, making sure no one was watching. 

“Okay, let’s see if it’s unlocked,” he said, testing the door handle. To his surprise, it turned easily, and the door creaked open. 

Inside, the air was stale, thick with dust and the faint scent of industrial cleaner. Martin turned on his phone’s flashlight, illuminating a narrow corridor lined with storage units. The walls were adorned with peeling paint and faded signage. 

“This place gives me the creeps,” Lena whispered, her voice echoing slightly in the silence. “Are you sure we should be here?”

“We need to find out what’s happening,” Martin replied, resolve hardening his voice. “We can’t turn back now.” 

They moved cautiously down the corridor, the beam of light from Martin’s phone cutting through the darkness. They paused at the first unit, marked with a faded number. Martin hesitated, then gently pulled the door open. It screeched on its hinges, and they both flinched.

Inside, the unit was empty, save for a few scattered boxes and a thick layer of dust. “Nothing here,” Martin muttered, his heart sinking. 

They continued down the row, checking each unit. Most were empty or filled with old furniture, but as they reached the end of the corridor, a faint sound caught Martin's attention—a muffled conversation coming from somewhere deeper within the facility.

“Did you hear that?” he whispered to Lena. She nodded, her eyes wide with fear.

“Let’s go check it out,” Martin said, his heart racing. They crept toward the source of the sound, which seemed to be coming from a larger unit at the far end.

As they approached, Martin could make out distinct voices—two men arguing heatedly. He pressed his ear against the door, straining to catch snippets of the conversation.

“...told you it was a bad idea!” one voice hissed, filled with frustration. “Now they’re onto us!”

“We can handle it. We just need to keep the shipments moving,” the other replied, calmer but with an underlying edge of menace. “We can’t let anyone find out.”

Martin exchanged a glance with Lena. They needed to know more, but how? 

“Should we go in?” Lena whispered, her voice barely audible.

“No,” Martin replied, his mind racing. “We need to find out what they’re planning without getting caught. Let’s see if we can find a way to listen in without being seen.”

They stepped back and scanned the corridor for any other openings. Martin spotted a small window near the top of the unit’s wall. “If we can climb up and look through, we might be able to see what’s happening inside.”

“Are you sure that’s a good idea?” Lena asked, concern etched on her face. “What if they see us?”

“We’ll be quick,” Martin assured her. “We need this information.”

Together, they managed to find a stack of old crates nearby, using them to climb up to the window. Martin hoisted himself up first, peering through the grimy glass. The view inside was partially obscured, but he could make out the two men standing beside a table cluttered with packages.

“Look!” Martin whispered urgently, signaling for Lena to join him.

She climbed up next to him, her breath hitching as she focused on the scene inside. The two men were now rifling through boxes, pulling out neatly packed bags that glimmered under the dim light.

“Is that…?” Lena began, but Martin nodded, understanding her unspoken words. It was what they had feared—drugs, being processed and prepared for distribution.

“Looks like we were right,” Martin murmured, his heart pounding. “This is a major operation.”

As they continued to watch, one of the men pulled out a phone and spoke into it, his tone urgent. “We need to move the product tonight. I don’t care what it takes. If anyone gets in our way, deal with them. We can’t afford any mistakes.”

Lena’s eyes widened in horror. “Did you hear that? They’re not just dealing drugs; they’re threatening people!”

Martin felt a surge of adrenaline and fear. “We need to get this evidence back to George and figure out our next move. But we have to be careful. If they see us leaving…”

Before he could finish, the door to the unit swung open, and one of the men stepped out, glancing around suspiciously. Martin and Lena froze, hearts racing as they pressed themselves against the wall, barely breathing.

The sound of steel against the half full bowl of cereal was a grinding noise that whittled away at my already strained mental state. I had risen early with the intention of making something nice for Grace and I. Only for those intentions of being dashed almost immediately when I had descended the stairs to find Grace sitting at the dining room table with a cup of coffee in hand. Waiting for me to join her.

Without the motivation to cook something more for the both of us, grabbing the nearest prepackaged box became the only easy solution.

I had taken my seat at the other head of the table and started to dig into my food without any real enthusiasm or desire to finish the meal. Now I had taken to running the spoon along the edge of the bowl, the unpleasant scraping of ceramic on wet steel squeaking across the table with a sharpness that brought out a grimace from both of us every time I succeeded in hitting a high note.

“Please stop that.” Grace murmured, lifting her mug as she did so. “You know that sounds awful.” I nodded in agreement, pushing the spoon into the bowl before glancing up from the congealed milk and circular wet loops to look at Grace.

I can’t do her justice in describing her but I’ll still give it my best. She has a soft, narrow face with a peachy skin that perfectly accompanies her light steel blonde hair which is always done up in a bonytail save for a few perfectly placed lopsided locks that drift in waves over her cheeks. Her eyes are a sea green, almost a bright cyan blue that is quite striking and has always been one of my favourite things about her appearance.

She must have noticed me watching her and simply chosen not to respond. Taking a long sip of her drink before she rested it back in place on its coaster. Sticking out against the circular marks left by my inability to implement the tiny piece of wood.

“I saw your car.” She nodded behind me to the wreck of a vehicle that I had been able to navigate home. “Was it a bad crash?” She flicked the tip of her finger towards my face and my poor brutalised nose that had been battered all throughout the last night.

I did my best to give her a bemused smile that accompanied a shake of the head. It wasn’t bad. Just bad luck and poor observations that led to the thick plaster that I had placed across the bridge of my nose. She didn’t need to worry.

“No, thankfully the car still works alright, I’ll go get repairs in the city after work.”

“Do you need a ride home?” Her immediacy caught me off guard. It was uncharacteristic for her to be so willing to keep a conversation going. Offering a lift when my own car was broken was also something I hadn’t expected from her. But I didn’t feel that I could take her up on the offer. I didn’t want to be a burden more than I already had and I knew that she was only keeping me entertained out of pity for my nightmare and the bad blows to my face.

I wouldn’t force her to spend more time around me then she already had to bear. Imposing my own presence on her wouldn’t do any good. Although a small inkling inside my brain fought against these notions. What if she genuinely wanted to spend time with me? What if my odd behaviour from the last night had been able to catch more than just pity?

Doubtful.

Finally in response to her offer I shook my head again.

“Thank you, but I'll be good, I can rent a car or get a taxi.” Grace nodded politely as I rejected her offer. The corners of her eyes screwed up with a pained yet careful restraint, a pang of guilt twitched in my chest and I knew I’d made a mistake.

I stood up abruptly from my seat and started to wander back out towards my wrecked car, words falling in mumbling trails from my lips as I tried to string together an apology or half measure that I could offer.

“I have to go, can we talk later?” I was speaking too quickly and we both knew it as she bobbed her head and was already making her way out of her seat.

“Sure,” Grace’s words left in an exhale as she pried her cup off the table and turned back to the sink.

I was already out the door, walking at a brisk pace as I tried to outrun the embarrassment of my poor choices. I didn’t need to think about that or what I could have said differently, today was one that I needed to focus on, I had work. Then I could focus on fixing things after work. I’d apologise to Grace, I’d apologise for everything and really set things right.

My thoughts were temporarily halted as a strange lingering notion sat in the air around me. I was standing in the same spot that I had seen occupied by the strange man the previous night. In my haze of half sleep as he watched me from behind the edges of my desecrated car.

Tasting a drink of air on my tongue a sudden bitter chill washed its way down my throat causing me to gag. Of all the thoughts I needed to push down, that was especially one that needed to stay back. Fictitious weavings of my delirious mind appearing around me were unneeded and unwanted.

But even so I still considered how I stood in the same place he had. Watching through that large window to the occupants of the household that lay within its interior. Treading over familiar surfaces and shielded by the walls of the house’s thick armour. Now I could only see Grace living inside the home.

I coughed as I felt a warm wet sensation settle upon the back of my neck and I wrenched my eyes away from where she stood, cleaning her mug with the cold water that ran over her hands.

I felt a peculiar kind of disgust with myself as I limply lifted one of my hands to the car's handle and my eyes caught a strange set of markings towards the car’s crumpled hood.

I couldn’t tell if the markings had been there the previous night and were simply part of the wreck that had occurred after I had collided with the young moose. Four deep scratches that all ran parallel to each other towards the right headlight.

I was seeing things, it was part of the wreck and being paranoid wasn’t going to make my life easier. I didn’t need to invent hardships. Come on mark, this is ridiculous. 

Without a second thought I sat down in the driver's seat and made my way along the winding road towards Vancouver. Eclipsing the mileage of trees that encroached on the highway and fixing my gaze on the painted white strips along the concrete path. Occasionally letting my eyes wander to those four perfect scratches.

…

“So Mark, thoughts?” The chipper voice of my coworker, Charles, curiously crawled along the lobes of my ears as I watched, aghast and horrified by the racks of metal cages that lay behind thick panes of glass. Separating the pair of us from the subjects-to-be as they cried and bayed from within their tiny confinements.

Behind that glass pane were nine fully grown, male chimpanzees. All of which were hairless and actively antagonising each other through the bars of their cages.

I wasn’t even sure what to say. I felt stuck to the spot as I observed the chimps hollering cries, the rest of the bustle and footfall in the hallway behind us fading into a fuzzy blur that only served to be additional white noise. I could feel my mouth hanging open with shock as I turned slowly to stare directly at my colleague.

Charles was only slightly younger than I was, but that was still pushing it, he had a naive face with a toothy smile and a stubby nose. Curly red brown locks floating over his cheeks and adding to his own youthful expression. In the moment I wanted nothing more than to slap him and turn that rosy face into a deep black blue. How could he look that… content, with such a deeply confronting sight before us?

“What on earth am I looking at?” I tried to demand in a way that was forceful but still respectful of him as my equal.

His eyes shifted in slight confusion as his mouth screwed up in a strangely exaggerated confusion before he opened his mouth ever so slightly to reply.

“The… subjects? The ones were testing the new batch on?” His voice was full of a condescending matter of factness that only made it harder to hold my tone in line and prevent myself from snapping at him.

“Yeah, no, I got that, I meant since when are we using chimps?” He only replied with a vacant stare, unresponsive to my previous question.

“Charles, how the hell are we even using chimps? How did they get here? How did nothing cross my desk? Who wrote off on this?” Question after question I continued to lambast his dismissal of the chimps being so nonchalant.

“Doesn’t it make sense?” A reply that only confused me further as I failed to grasp his meaning.

“The meds are meant for human illnesses, the brain structure of chimps is closer to humans than any of the rodents. I thought someone just figured the same and was able to pull a few strings.” I wasn’t even sure how true that was. It made sense logically to assume the chimps may far better then the tiny lab rats that had been standard issue for animal testing. Although the use of apes made things… difficult. What if someone found out? They’d be hell to pay for sure.

But more than that I found it deeply unnerving to be conducting experiments on a creature not that far off from humans.

Have any of you seen a chimp? In person and shaved bare? Its almost uncanny how close to the human body their own anatomy resembles. Short and stout masses of muscle sinew and greyed skin with an outer layer that was worn with the hardships of life. Faces with overlong ears pushed too far back along their scap and mouths of twisted canines that peeled back behind large lips. Among their menacing and uncanny attributes I found their eyes to be deeply unnerving.

Shining pupils that hinted at a level of intelligence that was easy to underestimate. Constantly flickering and turning to examine the room and especially the unaware human captors.

“Mark, come on, let’s get this over with.” Charles lowered his gaze to the locker that sat beside the sliding door and was already loading a gun with a tranquilliser.

Necessary safety procedures I supposed, especially regarding the size of the experiment's participants.

Charles led the way into the room as I followed reaching into the same locker to retrieve a pair of syringes containing the new experimental drugs that with any luck would have been a major breakthrough in our research and a huge step forward in its respective field.

Now, the two of us were standing inside the room with the apes behind their cages. I heard a mechanical crunching noise of the locks being initiated on the door and knew that someone from the observation room was coordinating with our own actions. The observation room was behind a large one way mirror that blended in seamlessly with the rest of the walls.

Even in the moment it felt strange to lock the door behind us. Safety precautions and all but was it really necessary to keep the pair of us contained with the chimps?

Charles was beginning to approach the chimp to the far side of the room in the lower left corner of the grid and trying to prod the end of his gun through the bars so that he could sedate the ape without missing. A task made more difficult than it was needed to due to the apes own efforts of pushing the barrel out of its cage before quickly darting back to the end of the container and coiling up into a ball. Repeating the erratic movements out of panic and fear.

“Damnit, stay still.” Charles huffed to himself as he continued to fiddle with the gun while I stood to the side holding the syringes like a pleb, waiting for him to sedate the chimp and growing increasingly irritated by how he handled the tool.

“Charles, let me…” I was about to butt in before he shoved the barrel of the tranq gun deep into the cage, prodding the chimp in its side and enraging the already paranoid animal.

It lashed out, grabbing the metal barrel and yanking it with such force that Charles fell forward and smashed his nose against the shelf above the chimp. A crack of cartilage barely audible above the chimps shouts as his nose twisted to its side.

Without thinking I rushed to his side as I simultaneously dropped the syringes I held, letting them clatter against the ground. My fingers scraped along his lab coat and then felt the muscles in his whole body seize up and a scream of pain rang out.

I wasn’t initially sure what happened as my eyes were still locked onto the tranq gun that the chimp at his waist was clutching and his face was pressed into the cage before him. My eyes took their time to reach the point where his neck ended and chin began. The point where another chimp had been able to press it’s fingers around the bar and beneath the tender skin that graced that cold metal.

The chimp was holding Charles’ face to the cage and gripping onto the bars at the same time. Hot blood gushing from his neck and tainting his brilliant white lab coat with dark ugly blotches. Charles had no clue how to react, his arms shooting off in all directions with every slight curling of the chimps fingers in his throat as he made an odd gurgling noise in place of a scream and his eyes had shrunk into themselves.

I wasn’t fairing much better. I was still helplessly clutching his sides, gently trying to pull him away from the chimp and failing at this bout of strength I was glancing back at the invisible mirror to my left. Screaming desperate pleas at whoever was meant to be observing our actions.

“Get help! We need help!”

By then the world turned upside down as I felt myself fall back under the weight of Charles’ as a pair of noises fell upon our ears.

The first and loudest of the two was a bending of metal and breaking of steel as the gun was leveraged against the metal bars to pry the front of its cage away. 

The second noise was one that even now is still ringing in my ears. A strange slick, wet sound that I can only describe as a stack of paper being ripped through all at once. Tearing of a thin piece of parchment away from a larger whole.

I knew what had happened and I was dreading when I would need to open my eyes and bear witness to the grizzly sight that lay around me. Feeling the weight of a limp, shivering body on top of me, accompanied with a dripping of warm liquid onto my chest that was living a gradually blossoming wet mark that burrowed deeper into my heart.

I could still feel Charles’ heart beating and in a second I was grateful that he was still alive and had simply fallen unconscious from the act I couldn’t bear to see.

I started to sit up. Keeping my eyes barred shut as I pulled myself back so that I could begin to gather my bearings. Eyes starting to flit open to scan the whole scene.

Only then noticing that the cries and choir of the pained subjects had fallen totally silent. My eyes darted up and fluttered across the whole array of nine cages in swift frantic motions. All of them were watching me from where I sat with an expressionless intelligent stare.

Their eyes deep and aware of the scene that lay before them as they held their hands over their knees and kept their mouths concealed from view. The ape who sat in the bottom left cage being the exception. It had crawled from its enclosure and now stood on its hands and feet, watching me with it’s beady human eyes.

It knew, it knew that I was stuck there with it. Its shining eyes reflected lethal sentience that sent waves of terror across my spine.",0,1736770566.0,nosleep,1,0.5,False

I had heard so much about the competitive job market and was prepared—both mentally and skill-wise—to face the challenge head-on.

# The Beginning: Hope Turns to Frustration

* **Month 1:** No calls, no responses—absolute silence from recruiters.
* **Month 2:** I began to adapt, polishing my resume and learning how the market worked.
* **Month 3:** I finally landed my first offer after three grueling rounds of interviews.

The offer wasn’t perfect, but it was a start. I noticed a small clause in the contract that needed clarification, so I called the manager who had sent the offer. He agreed with my concern and assured me it would be corrected. I felt optimistic.

But then, **radio silence for three days.** When I followed up, I was shocked to hear that the company no longer wanted me. They had hired a developer from another nationality for half the salary. A team leader later confirmed this to me.

I was devastated. I thought it was just bad luck.

# The Second Chance: From Bad to Worse

I started over with a new visa and renewed determination. After three more months of relentless job hunting, I accepted a job that paid **60% of the salary of the first offer, which was already below average.** I tried to stay positive and focus on moving forward.

But then I encountered something far worse: a **toxic workplace culture.** Within a week, it was glaringly obvious that employees were treated as little more than machines:

* Bathroom breaks? **You had to clock out and back in**, even for a few minutes.
* I once asked the CEO why there was no coffee for developers. His response? “Is it mentioned in the contract?”

Four months in, I was completely burned out. I left because I couldn’t take it anymore. But most of my colleagues couldn’t do the same—they had families and responsibilities. The business owner exploited this, knowing they had no choice but to endure.

Here’s what I’ve learned about the job market in Dubai:

1. **Connections Are Everything:** Around 95% of jobs and interviews happen through referrals.
2. **Exploitation Is Common:** Many people are willing to work for as little as 25% of a fair salary just to support their families, and companies know it.
3. **Burnout Culture:** Employees are treated as disposable, with no regard for their well-being.

1i0cl7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1i0cl7w/trapped_animal/,Trapped animal,"We were dating for almost 4 years, with 3 of those years living together.

He quit a job he wasn’t satisfied with, and we moved to the main city for better work opportunities. I got a job immediately, but he didn’t—well, he wasn’t even trying. He was sending CVs at the rate of 1 every 2 months, and obviously, he got rejected. I tried to help him find a job. Twice I tried networking through my friends and almost every week I sent him different job opportunities.

Turned out both jobs were “bad,” and all the offers were “beyond his skillset or wierd company""… okay.

When we were searching for a flat, I was the one who did the search and the tours of course the lease agreement was under my name. The rent was paid from my account.

When we moved in together, I told him to arrange the internet connection for us. I waited for more than a month until I ended up managing it myself.

The electricity was also handled by me and paid from my account.

He didn’t send me the money unless I asked, and I always felt bad for asking. Even though he had way more savings (a gift from his mother) than me, somehow, a new MacBook or a Camera (Sony Alfa a7) or new lens was more important than rent.

He stayed at home for almost 3 years, playing Counterstrike and drinking one beer after another. And he claimed to be “depressed.” I found 4 therapists for him near our flat. The first one had a funny name, the second had a weird website, and so on.

He didn’t do any of the household stuff. Laundry, cleaning, cooking—even minor repairs were left to me. Groceries? He didn’t like shopping, so I did that too.

I never got flowers from him, and I don’t recall a single birthday gift.

I always heard, “You’re not a supportive girlfriend.” When I replied, “Hey, I go to work, I do the groceries, I do the cleaning and cooking, and I even tried to find you a job and a therapist—what else I should do to support you?” he’d say, “You’re not giving me the emotional support I need.” Okay…

I hoped it would get better once he found a job, but nothing was happening.

It drove me crazy—to the point where I almost cried at work just seeing a male colleague clean up spilled coffee on the counter after himself.

I went to therapy, and my therapist said: “You know, I think he doesn’t care who stands beside him—whether it’s you, Amy, Lilly, or Anna—as long as the girl is taking care of him.”

That was my final wake-up call. I mean, I already knew I wanted to break up, but this was the eye-opener. I came home and told him I was done, that I couldn’t do this anymore. But it wasn’t a proper breakup.

Suddenly, he started looking for work. He started cleaning and doing the shopping. But I was done.

I cheated. He felt something was odd, but I denied it. Then, a month later, on New Year’s Eve, it came out.

He threw things at me, poured water on my face, spit on me and call me names. But I stayed. It wasn’t enough. I felt like I needed something more—something more harmful, like a slap—to finally walk away.

Then he told me to pack my things and leave.

I ran to my parents’ house and told my dad, feeling bad and guilty, thinking he would lecture me. But suddenly, he said, “Don’t worry. He wasn’t a good guy. It would’ve happened anyway.” I felt relief.

When I told my friends, feeling guilty, all of them said, “Yes, what you did was bad, but he was manipulative all the time, and we’re glad you’re out of it.”

Months after the breakup, I was receiving calls and texts, calling me a wh*re and a b*tch. He told me how much he’d changed, how I didn’t give him a single chance, and how he wanted to propose and have kids. I knew it was a trap.

It has been 2 years since the breakup, and I’ve found a supportive husband. Anyway, this experience is still with me, and I feel bad for cheating.
When I told my husband, he said: “Even a trapped animal will do everything to get out. You were a trapped animal. Don’t worry.”
