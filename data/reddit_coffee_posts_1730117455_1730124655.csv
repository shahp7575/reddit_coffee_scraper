Would you be ok with going on coffee, ice cream dates and (let her pay her own stuff) or walks in the park (the weather is beautiful now) for a few months with a gal that's doing the same with other men before you escalate any further?

1ge2x55,https://www.reddit.com/r/minipainting/comments/1ge2x55/want_to_have_both_shading_and_airbrushed_blending/,Want to have both shading and airbrushed blending on a mini with lots of texture.,"I want to see if what I want to do works; I have only started airbrushing a few months ago. I have highly textures miniature (Warhammer's Seraphon/Lizardmen Carnosaur heroes and Aggradon Lancers, for reference). If you notice on the minis, they have back spines, scales close to that, flatter skin layer further down on the model, and then a belly. My goal is to make the spines a dark purple, the top scales a lighter purple/burgundy, the main skin a red, and the belly a flesh tone. In particular, the red skin and the flesh tone I want to blend so I want to use my airbrush to simplify the blends. However, these models have a lot of recessed detail and texture. So if I apply a wash to the belly or skin, I get a ton of coffee staining and the wrong color overall and it ruins my blend.  If I blend after the shading, the blend will overwrite the shading and the mini will look flat again. Eventually I have to choose between blending and shading because one will end up covering up the other.

I want to shade and have a blend of different colors of skin from red to flesh tone. How do I achieve this?

Similar question: the scales have a similar problem as I want to blend them into the spine and maybe even in the skin. But each scale is basically a tiny island on the mini with recesses all around it. If I was hand painting, I would kind of know what to do but it is so time consuming to blend by hand and it doesn't look good when I do it. Airbrushing trivializes that blending process. How do I blend and shade scales which has a top layer that ""islands"" on the model (for a lack of a better term)?",1,1730124415.0,minipainting,1,1.0,False

1ge2w42,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1ge2w42/got_ghosted_for_the_first_time_by_my_former_fp/,"Got ghosted for the first time, by my former FP","Long story short, ex and I broke up 2+ years ago. It was a messy breakup and me being BP, handled it extremely poorly. I never expected to see or hear from my ex ever again.


It took lots of time, grieving, and reflecting to move on and I feel I am around 99% past everything. I spent the last 2 years focusing only on myself, cultivating friendships, and staying away from anything romantic.


However, 3 months ago I ran into my ex and I expected her to want nothing to do with me considering how I behaved during the breakup but it was the complete opposite. We reconnected through email, and started texting. It was honestly super pleasant and she held no ill-will towards me in spite of our past.


2 weeks ago I asked her through text if she wanted to get a coffee and catch up in person and she agreed! I was super stoked and looked forward to meeting up with her all week. The day before we were supposed to meet up I asked her if she wanted to go to a particular coffee shop. No response. The night before, I ask if we're still on for tomorrow and again, no response. We never met up and I haven't heard from her since. I know she's fine because she's active on social media (not my business nor do I really care, I just wanted to make sure she was okay), so I came to the conclusion that I'm being ghosted.


In spite of the fact that I've mostly moved on I still feel kind of shitty about it, and my past BPD tendencies have sprung up including the urge to bombard her with texts nonstop asking why she's doing this but I realize that's not the way to go about these things. I have been ruminating though and I feel like it's triggering certain feelings from the breakup unfortunately. It's the first time I've ever been ghosted and I seriously would not have seen this coming from a mile away considering how friendly she's been towards me since reconnecting.

What can I do to improve them?,"I've used bits of bark and cork for the main mass, and sand and coffee mix for the texture - all dry brushed. I quite like the moss on the rocks, but they look like they are lacking interesting elements with the actual earth/ground elements. The grass hasn't really helped here, I don't think.

The idea for these was to be fairly neutral terrain pieces as a test before I start making more for MESBG games.

Any advice appreciated - cc invited

It seems like most of the stuff people rec on similar threads is down in Center City, which is great, but can feel pretty far away on a weeknight (especially as the days get shorter!). And I know there are cool people here in the neighborhood! I just can't figure out where to meet them lol.

Some suggestions I have seen for this area: Friends of the Wiss group hikes, Mt. Airy Contra Dance, and I think that's it üòÖ I have googled for book clubs and Meetup groups and everything in between, and keep coming up empty handed.

For a year and some change I had back to back bv/yeast. Literally after treatment for the bv it was yeast and after yeast treatment i would have sex and literally be triggered back into bv/yeast again! Sex was a huge factor. So heres how I successfully beat this yeastbeast. I needed a round of clindamycin in my hooha for 5 days. Metronidazole did not work for me. My doctor (after going thru 3 doctors) finally took me serious and tested for the TYPE OF bacteria i had. Some weird strains like strep b and some other weird name came back. As well as candida albicans. After 5 days of the clindamycin (to break up the biofilm) i was then put on 7 days of amoxicillin and doxycycline. Combined, yes! symptoms of smell and weird discharge LEFT! my period however lasted 9 days which was odd to me because i only usually last 5. Got blood work done, my bloodsugar and a1c was high, my vit d low, my iron low‚Ä¶. This probably explains why i have been plagued with yeast for years on end. Not nearly as often as this past year of back to back but pretty much my whole life ive been a yeast bish! So i started taking vitamins like oregano oil, magnesium, vit c, vit d, prenatals. I detoxed from SUGAR CONSUMPTIONS ENTIRELY. It was very hard and drastic. No bread, no pasta, no beans, no rice, no candy, no deserts, no yogurt with a wholeeee lotta honey and granola (my fav) , no coffee with caramel and sugar and milk. It was a hard habit to break but i ended up losing weight and i have never felt better. I got carried away, ended up having sex with my man‚Ä¶ and boom woke up back feeling yeasty.. started to suspect it was him. To my surprise i called my doctor she ended up being so nice to prescribe me a medication she was hesitant to mention because of the risk. The medicine is called vivjoa! Its a new medicine for women with chronic yeast. Im allergic to fluconazole and honestly it doesnt work for me AT ALL. The medicine isnt safe for women who have reproductive potential but i didnt care. I just wanted this issue gone! Everything in life had risk and sometimes u gotta just take em! Pray for me and my eggs‚Ä¶ but I can say i am clear. Took about a week to feel 100% better. My libido is still low because sex scares me and makes me nervous. This was traumatic for me to go through. We ended up making love and it feel like we had been reunited! No yeast issues after, we used lube because this medication gives me slight vaginal dryness (not sure if maybe the antibiotics & years of boric acid couldve caused this too though so dont quote me 100%) im just so happy to be done with this. This did a number on my self esteem! Im finally feeling happy again, my mental health is healing and my vaginal health as well. And I‚Äôve developed a new lifestyle around my issues, im still going strong with detoxing from sugar and i feel amazing, im down 15 pounds.",1,1730124085.0,Healthyhooha,0,1.0,False

Should I ask for a LOR/name drop him in my SOP?,"I barely finished my master's program. I moved to another country at the height of covid and had a rough time meeting people. This affected my motivation to make progress on my thesis and I ended up doing most of the work one month before the deadline. My advisor was pretty hands-off and only checked in if I emailed first. I never felt like I was making enough progress to ask for a check-in. We met maybe 7 times total to discuss my thesis and he did give me some valuable insight, but the quality of my thesis just wasn't as good as it could have been. This country uses a different grading scale, but it ended up being the equivalent to a B+/3.3. I'm sure he wasn't happy with me putting it off until the last minute, and I did apologize for it.

Coincidentally, he does quite a bit of post-doc work for one of the universities I'm eyeing for a PhD, which just so happens to be near my home (we've met for coffee on-campus a couple times during my writing process, but I haven't talked to him since submitting it). He also runs one of their summer programs. I'm thinking of asking him for a letter of recommendation, but I don't know that he'll say yes. Also, I'm wondering if I should name-drop him in my statement of purpose It seems relevant to talk about my thesis in the SOP, but I'm not sure about mentioning him (or any other professors) specifically.

1ge2ll7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waiting_To_Wed/comments/1ge2ll7/looked_at_rings_with_zero_prompting_from_me/,Looked at rings with zero prompting from me,"I thought some of you might relate to this. I've had 3 serious relationships (currently hopefully in my last).

First one was extremely romantic. Good guy. Generous. But he just didn't have his life together. Essentially he talked a big game, said he wanted to get married, but when I finally asked for his timeline around 2 years in, he got pretty defensive and it weirded me out, and I broke it off.

Second one was the ""perfect on paper"" type. Great job, stable, handsome, tall, published author and was a contributor to national news programs focused on his field. Also very romantic, lots of displays of affection, long texts and letters about how incredible I am and how he can't wait to spend forever with me. He was all words and that was my mistake, what I learned from that. He turned out to be a nightmare, extremely selfish and stingy. Had hundreds of thousands of dollars in savings but would freak out if I got the Campbell's chicken noodle soup instead of the generic store brand (I'm frugal too, but, my goodness). Venmo-requested me for a $5 coffee (after paying for everything for the first few months saying he'd be ashamed to not). His selfishness got to the point where he got a job offer in a different state and I said ""I don't like it there, I'll move for you once we're engaged, but I'd like to live in this neighborhood to be closest to the city feel."" He flipped out and said I'm ""being a dictator"". Ok buddy, you're dumped. He called me crying and insisted he had bought a ring. I said ""no you didn't"" and hung up. Trash.

My current boyfriend is not like them. He is not really an affectionate person and at the beginning of our relationship it was a little uncomfortable for me to not receive love-bombing essentially. He holds my hand all the time, is extremely supportive and sweet, but he never really writes out or tells me what he likes about me. He gives me loads of words of affirmation but it's more casual than a grand declaration of love. I wondered at first, ""is this something I can live with forever?"" I can now say, absolutely. He loves through actions. He would be there anytime I need him (and he is this way towards his parents, siblings, and friends). He is the most generous person I've ever met. Also, we agree on nearly everything and have only ever had one argument (which was mostly just an hour-long talk), I think because we have a very similar view of the world while being VERY different people. (He's an extrovert and loves putting on a show but can be a little prickly or stubborn, and I'm an introvert who's happy to be with him while he's the center of attention and a bit more patient haha.)

Last week he looked over and said ""do you want to look at engagement rings today?"" And honestly I didn't see it coming! We've been together for about 14 months. I did, though, tell myself that at 2 years I will walk (and we'd already established that's enough time to know at our age - late 20s).

We went and looked and I honestly had no clue what I wanted or what I was doing. I told him I'd be happy with anything he chose (although he knows I am not the type to be ""happy with a ring pop"" lol). And as we're shopping and looking, he tells me he already designed 2 different ones online that he thought I'd like, and this was just for confirmation! He's also explaining all the diamond and ring terminology and differences that I have no clue about lol. He's definitely been thinking about this for a while. Also a true humble brag here but the salesperson at one store asked if I like the 2 carat better than the 1.5 and I said ""oh they're both beautiful...."" and my guy chimed in ""I definitely like the 2 carat, she's just too polite to say it"". Haha!

The salesperson at one of the stores even said ""I'm not sure how soon you're thinking, but..."" and he said ""oh, soon"".

So now the agonizing wait. He's been really concerned about our Thanksgiving plans so I think he plans to talk with my dad then. And we have a trip to Switzerland right before Christmas... I don't know how I'm going to deal because I've already annoyed my friends and mom to oblivion, so I will talk to Reddit in the meantime. :)

Lessons learned:

* Leave as soon as you get that ""pit in your stomach"" feeling
* I now think generosity is the top value to screen for in a partner. 50/50 just doesn't exist in a real marriage, you need someone who won't keep score (and you need to be someone who won't keep score too hard either).",0,1730123618.0,Waiting_To_Wed,1,0.5,False

I just returned from a 4 full days trip to Paris and I would like to share my experience as I hope it might be helpful for other people who wish to visit soon. If anyone has questions, opinions or would like help with their itinerary, feel free to comment.

To make things easy, I'll first present a simplified itinerary of what I visited during each day, in chronological order. Then I will talk about the positives and negatives of my trip, and finally post some tips and tricks that I hope will help other tourists.

# Itinerary

**Monday**

* Arc de Triomphe
* Champs-√âlys√©es
* Louvre - The Richelieu wing

**Tuesday**

* Pantheon (including the panoramic view)
* Jardin du Luxembourg
* Notre-Dame
* Sainte-Chapelle

**Wednesday**

* Versailles (Palace and Gardens)
* Trianon Estates
* Champ de Mars
* Trocadero Gardens (Eiffel Tower photos)

**Thursday**

* Mus√©e de l‚ÄôOrangerie
* Place de la Concorde
* Louvre - Sully and Denon wings
* Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay

# Positives

* We had surprisingly good weather, although it is late October. While mornings were chilly afternoons felt more like summer time with all the sun and warmth, but it was safe to keep a coat handy as some days were windier than others.
* The city is breathtakingly beautiful and the streets were much cleaner than expected; don't let all the mean comments about how Paris is dirty and full of trash fool you, I've seen way worse (trust me).
* While the museums are definitely worth visiting, just walking around the city feels like going through an art gallery. There are gorgeous sights all around and while my partner and I ended up with some pretty bad leg pain from all the walking, I don't regret deciding to spend the first two days walking around instead of using public transport (we ended up walking about 80km on foot throughout our trip according to my fitness tracker).
* Public transport is really accessible and easy to use thanks to √éle-de-France Mobilit√©s. We installed the app so we could buy bus/metro tickets online and while we didn't have to use it much, we'll definitely keep it for next time we visit because there are still so many things we'd like to see.
* The museums are very well organised and it's easy to explore them as they provide maps and lots of signs, so we didn't get lost even at the Louvre.
* Definitely take advantage of free entries if you are under 26, we were lucky to still get those and this is why we decided to do two trips to the Louvre. It was less overwhelming than trying to cram the whole visit into just one day and we got to properly enjoy everything that the museum had to offer.
* Versailles seemed quite far but the train got us there surprisingly fast, so don't be afraid to go visit the palace and its surroundings if that's something you'd love to see. Also, I really recommend installing their app, the interactive map they provide is really well done and the best guide we had.
* There is a huge variety of food places and the ingredients are usually of really good quality. Even if you're not into traditional French cuisine, there are options that will fit any taste, regardless of culture, dietary restrictions or budget. You don't even need to do much research, Google Maps is your friend and you can also just go with the flow and see what you find while strolling around the city.
* I absolutely LOVED Le Caf√© des Chats, I looked forward to visiting this place since my sister went there herself a while ago, and it was 100% worth it. I admit it might not be for everyone, but if you want a great meal in the company of adorable cats, this is the ideal place. Also my boyfriend loved the beer here, so it's worth a try.

# Negatives

* The Seine indeed looks quite dirty, so we weren't keen on going on boat trips. However it wasn't as sore of a sight as I expected before arriving in Paris, it's still a decent view.
* The queues at the museums and other attractions can be insanely long. While some queues are well organised, such as the one at Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay that has dedicated lines for those with priority, normal tickets, and no tickets, others can become chaotic. For example, at the Louvre, everyone seems to queue for the Pyramid entrance, forming what looks like an infinite line, but the Caroussel entrance was almost empty both times we went and we got in really quickly. There's also the Richelieu entrance, but it's apparently reserved for groups and visitors with membership cards.
* One bad queue experience we did have was at Sainte-Chapelle, although the visit was definitely worth it. We booked the 16:00 time slot and arrived 30 minutes earlier (we decided to take the bus instead of walking because we were tired, so we ended up arriving way earlier), but we only managed to get in around 16:30 because the queue was a mess. People without tickets joined the line and ended up causing a delay for those who had time slots booked for later in the day, so when we arrived those with a 15:00 time slot were still struggling to get in. This could've been avoided if they had a separate queue for those without tickets, but I understand they're limited by the fact that the waiting line is on the sidewalk, which offers little space.
* While I saw posts on this subreddit recommending the Bouillon restaurant chain, I personally wouldn't suggest it UNLESS you are a group of at least 4 people. I wasn't aware of the fact that you get seated with strangers at the table, and this ruined our dinner experience as the waiter randomly seated two French girls at our table who proceeded to mock me throughout the entire meal, thinking that I don't understand French just because I spoke English to the waiter so my boyfriend who doesn't know French could understand as well. I also found it odd they did this because there were several free tables and they could've just sat those rude girls somewhere else. In addition to all that, the food was awful and the duck breast I ordered was the worst I've ever had, and I love duck and can cook it way better myself. At least the snails were good.
* Very few public toilets for some reason. When we arrived at the shuttle station in La D√©fense there were no toilets available, we kept asking around and people told us there's none (maybe that's why some areas around there smelled like piss). We had to walk all the way to a park closer to the city centre where we finally found a public toilet, which turned out to be partially faulty but not out of order. Safest bet is to go to a fast food chain, from my experience the bathrooms there are surprisingly clean and more spacious than those at more traditional restaurants, also they don't check if you ordered or not.
* Way too many things to see. I know, not a bad thing and it's our fault for not planning a longer trip, but we definitely should've taken into consideration some more time to rest as by the end of our stay we were exhausted. However, we are happy we made it to what we planned to visit and now we have even more ideas for what we can visit next time.

# Tips and tricks

* Try to book any visits you plan online whenever possible, as early as possible. It's easy to find the official sites and it's way cheaper than booking through intermediaries. This will ensure you don't end up being turned away in case the line is too big, as I saw this happen at Sainte-Chapelle (at 16:30 those without a ticket were asked to leave).
* If you're in Paris on Thursday and plan to visit Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay, do so after 6PM. It's the only day of the week when they're open until 9PM and 3 hours are plenty to see the entire museum, plus this way you're avoiding the crowds and the tickets are cheaper too.
* If you plan to visit Versailles, you'll have to buy a ticket from your nearest railway station. √éle-de-France Mobilit√©s does not sell these tickets on the phone app as the desitination is currently outside their range, but you can easily buy the necessary tickets from a station.
* If you buy train tickets, they're available for any train on the route you chose at any time on the same date that's printed on the ticket. We ended up spending an extra hour at Versailles and we had no problem getting on a train at a different time than originally planned. Also, for tickets bought for routes within Paris, you have an hour and a half from the moment of validating the ticket to get on ANY bus/metro/train you want as long as it is within the city.
* Not a fan of the Eiffel Tower (like me) but still want a good view of the city from above? There are two great alternatives: the Pantheon offers a panoramic view of the city, with little maps on every side of the balcony pinpointing the important buildings or monuments around the city, or the Montparnasse Tower, which offers the highest rooftop view of Paris and it is much taller, cheaper, and less popular than the Eiffel Tower. The only reason I skipped the Montparnasse Tower was because I wanted to only visit what we could see for free, but I'll definitely try the tower next time.
* If you see people crossing on red lights, that's normal. It took us a while to get used to the idea, but as long as you're not the only one crossing you'll be safe.
* Always keep a close eye on your phone/wallet/jewelry. While we got lucky and didn't run into any scammers or shady people, Paris is notorious for petty crimes and pickpocketing happening even in broad daylight. I also advise not having too much cash on you (I had none at all and didn't need it) so in case your wallet is lost/stolen you can just disable your cards and therefore minimise your loss.
* If your hotel doesn't offer breakfast for free or at all, that's no issue as you can just eat at a boulangerie (bakery). There are bakeries literally everywhere and they have a great variety of foods and drinks, including pastries, cakes, sandwiches, coffee, soda or fresh/bottled fruit juice. They're also great for a cheap lunch in case you don't want to spend much on restaurants.
* There's no shame if you go eat at a Burger King instead of the fanciest restaurant around. As I said, there is a lot of variety in food places, and honestly one of the best dinners we had was going to a Five Guys because my boyfriend never tried it before and we had a blast for way less money than we spent elsewhere.

I had to park and walk a little. As I was walking, I realized I didn‚Äôt recognize where I was. It didn‚Äôt look odd or anything, it just wasn‚Äôt familiar. I realized I was really far from my car, so I tried to get an Uber back to it, but my phone wasn‚Äôt working right. So I went into a coffee shop. It was a normal coffee place except all of the menu items had strange names. I asked two women in line where I was and we figured out that I was in another dimension (more like a parallel universe, I suppose). I ordered a really delicious dessert (it was like a big peanut butter cup, lol) and kept it walking. It was getting dark and I eventually wandered into an area I recognized. I was worried that I had missed work and was wondering why no one had called to find out where I was. I didn‚Äôt know if I had actually wandered into another dimension or if I just thought I had. I was trying to figure it out and plan what I would tell my boss (‚ÄúI wandered into another dimension‚Äù and ‚ÄúI got confused and thought I was in another dimension‚Äù both sounded weird, even to dream me) when I woke up.

Service was great.  They leave a pot of coffee on your table, and it was good coffee.  Creamer is in those little plastic packets.  

Food?  It looked great, but was mid.  The scrambled eggs in particular had a certain plasticity to them.  Perhaps someone who works there can chime in and let me know what's up with that.  Also ordered bacon, two slices, and a Belgian waffle.  It was okay but I would have rather had Waffle House.

They don't take your credit card, rather they leave you a bill with a QR code to pay.  The bill they brought was different than the on the QR code asked me to pay.....not in my order, but in the total.  Not sure what's up with that either.

I studied in the US for 2 years many years ago. I am interested in the US politics and more broadly where the world is going.

This year's US presidential election is a bit strange. I don't feel the heat of the past elections. Political divide feels larger than ever, but there is less formal and informal debates. Some people seem cynical about this whole democratic process.

So, I thought why not talk about it with non-Koreans in Korea. Over coffee or beer. Obviously Americans will be the best discussants for this, but anyone is welcome. Before the election day, but after may be fine too.

I am thinking a few people at a table. I am in Seoul, so it will have to take place in or near Seoul. It will be Dutch pay. I guess it would be around 20,000 krw per person for meals and drinks.

If you are interested, please leave comments or DM me.

Just in case I have to limit participation, please let me know why you will be a good participant. As to why I may be good to you, I believe in free speech in intellectual discussions.

I drafted so many suicide letters but cant seem to put everything in one letter i have so many things to say to my wife i just want to let her know how much i love her and shes the best thing thst evet happened to me. I blame my self for everything... i pushed her away when our business failed few years ago and this is my Karma. God is no longer listening to me and i guess its part of my punishment. I was wondering if you guys can help me organize my thoughts for my final letter to my wife.



This is what i have so far..


To my loving wife (_),
I‚Äôve thought a lot about this. I never imagined that the person I would write this letter to would be you, but after weeks of deciding, I knew it would be right to address this to you. I wanted to give you a heads up beforehand, however, no amount of planning and researching would be able to prepare me to write an adequate letter. This letter might not even graze the ends of your expectations, but I‚Äôm going to try my best to insert all of my reasons and thoughts into these words.
After what happened, I haven‚Äôt been able to grasp why I‚Äôm in this life. I haven‚Äôt been able to understand why I‚Äôm breathing, why I am not able to feel a glimpse of positive emotions. I simply cannot comprehend why I am still here when the one thing that propelled me to move on throughout the day was and still is you. When I took hesitant steps forward, I thought that I did it because I had a reason to keep moving ahead. When I wake up every morning, I thought that I got out of bed because there was something to look forward to every day. When I smiled, I thought that my happiness was genuine.
What a lie‚Ä¶
All those things were a facade. I lie to myself into believing that I had a purpose in life. However, I‚Äôm proud to say that I‚Äôve finally torn through the miniscule hole of masked reality. I know now that life can only continue to fully flourish without a being like me. This action will conclude my purpose. You may think that I‚Äôm exaggerating things, but honesty is a virtue that has built up in me to allow me to see that this is something I should‚Äôve done a while ago.
Regret has painted me behind iron bars. It feels as though I‚Äôm drowning in pure red contrition, helplessly reaching out to nothing. To hope that I can somehow escape this prison of regret is a thought reserved only for dreamers. I‚Äôve been locked out for a while now, and yet the memories never cease to fade away. After all the useless apologies and prayers, I‚Äôm still filled with instant sadness, regret, shame and mostly pain the second I‚Äôm awake. The remembrance is nailed and hammered down in my mind. The images race through my head in never ending circles, and every morning I wake up with a pounding headache. The recollections of that day flash in my mind the instant second I wake up, and again as I fall asleep at night, tears constantly stain my cheeks, and when they don‚Äôt, overwhelming sensation swirls down my stomach I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt ever be able to forgive myself. what I did to you. How can I, It‚Äôs the biggest mistake of my life. 
A slight whisper about what happened between us is like a knife to my heart. I will always remember the look on your face when you used to love me. Your smiles will always be etched to me, you are my better half and part of me will always be yours, you are my wife and how I wished to turn back time and just spend each moment with you, but now I have to face the fact that you are no longer in love with me and maybe in love with someone else. I do not blame you, I can only blame myself.
The thing is, I believed you when you said you also missed me before you went out the car from our trip from Barako grill, when you said you only needed time, when you cried the night, I left because of the fight with James and felt your love and we promised each other that we will be together again after the house contract expires. But now, I think I get it. I understand what I have to do. When we were together, even just a few Sundays ago, it was one of the best times of my life. It felt like everything would be okay. We had lunch, shared a great conversation, went to your favorite caf√©, and you let me try your favorite peanut butter coffee. Afterward, we walked around the marina, and I held your hand. I never wanted that day to end. But after that day, you disappeared again. I didn‚Äôt want to bother you, so I kept my distance and hurt in silence.
A few weeks later, I sent you a message asking if we could try marriage counseling, and you agreed, asking when, where, and how. But the next day, when I told you I found a clinic, you asked what the clinic was for. Then you told me you weren‚Äôt ready for it. Once again, I felt crushed.
You asked me why I‚Äôm so quick to give up when it‚Äôs only been 3-4 months and why I haven‚Äôt tried courting you again. Love, I have been trying to connect with you, doing everything I can to see you, to talk to you. But what did you tell me? You said you‚Äôre no longer there, and you don‚Äôt know if you ever will be.
I‚Äôll never forget this, but don‚Äôt worry I don‚Äôt blame you. I‚Äôm blaming myself.
To be honest, I think that the reason behind why I hadn‚Äôt taken this action until now is because I was afraid, and I was still hoping that we can fix things between us. But now, I‚Äôm not afraid anymore and you gave me a clear picture that life without you is inevitable. It brings me shame to know that I‚Äôve delayed this option for so long, so I‚Äôm choosing the fastest way to go. I hope you know that the reason why I stayed a little longer is you, I hope my silence can give you the peace my love can‚Äôt. My life‚Äôs greatest memory is when I was with you. I remember the yellow shirt you wore when you came to our house and spent the night. You encouraged me to come to Dubai and seek a better future with you. We've grown together and achieved so much. Everything good in me is because of you.
The day we got married, I gave half of myself to you. Yes, I felt pressured to prove that we could have a good life together in everyone‚Äôs eyes. When it didn‚Äôt work out, I thought everything was over. I cannot express enough how sorry I am. I do want to spend every second with you, to have and to hold, from that day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part. I love you and I will always love you. Every inch of me longs for you. It‚Äôs been months, and I can‚Äôt seem to find rest. I am alone. I‚Äôve rejected everyone around me because my heart longs for you alone. You told me that you‚Äôre just living life and that I should too. I understand that feeling, and I hope that one day you will understand where I am coming from. I don‚Äôt know who is influencing you to move further away from me each day, but I have no control over them. I am not trying to turn things around as you said. I am simply longing for you and telling you that my love will never tarnish.

I told you that I will always be here for you, and I will be. You may no longer see me, but my presence will always be with you. Reading this, you might think that I am overreacting or creating drama, but I‚Äôm not. These are the words from my heart. 

Hopefully it‚Äôs better than the life I‚Äôm about to disappear in. Reincarnation is an option that I‚Äôve thought about a lot. Having no memory of who I am right now sounds like a wonderful scenario. If I get reincarnated and the afterlife doesn‚Äôt exist, however, then you and I won‚Äôt ever be able to see each other again. That is a possibility that I refuse to believe in, because who am I in death if I cannot even catch a glimpse of you?

If you‚Äôre still confused, I just want you to know that I can‚Äôt wait to see you again. I hope that Life has been treating you well. And I love you. I always have. And I always will.
Love,

So, I live a pretty lowfat life. Pretty much everything I buy is fat free (I also tend to avoid added sugar), and it's part of why I wanted a creami in the first place. But, because of how ice cream WORKS, without fat or sugar, the results will be... not great! Now, I've been brainstorming ways to make my treats not icy: I could use coffee creamer as a thickener (but its still got no fat), malted milk powder for a bit of fat/flavor, pudding mix (although without any added sugars or fat, idk how much it can do), just a tablespoon of cream/cottage cheese, straight up added a teaspoon of sugar, or xanthan gum.

1ge200u,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1ge200u/my_top_5_twin_peaks_episodes/,My Top 5 Twin Peaks episodes,"No show has affected me in the same dreamy, mysterious, terrifying way as Twin Peaks. The list of my favorite episodes my change from day to day, but at least at this moment, this is my Top 5 episodes in the entire show:

# #5: There's Fire Where You Are Going (The Return Part 11)

There are so much to enjoy here. Everything from deep terror to a melancolic feeling of nostalgia. The start is a tense sequence of Shelly and Bobby's daughter, followed by Hasting's brutal death and a strange glimpse into the Convenience Store. Aka Twin Peaks strangeness at its finest. We continue to see a heartbreaking scene of how Bobby has matured, but Shelly is still ""stuck"" somewhat in her badboy youth. Another reminder that the world of The Return is not sunshine and roses at all. It's followed by the strange scene of the shootout and Bobby investigating the ""crazy"" car lady with the sick child. To this day, I still don't know the significance of this scene - I only know what it makes me feel! Before turning over to the Dougie part of the episode, we get an underrated scene between Hawk and Frank where we see Hawk's map. The reason I love it is how Hawk says ""Frank, you don't ever want to know about that"" while pointing at the owl/Judy symbol. It's another reminder of the exitencially terrifying aura of Judy.

The Dougie part of the episode is one of his finest. It's light hearted and comedy gold, while also having tension in it. The best part however is the diner scene. I remember the first time I saw it; the good vibes of pure positivity, which really stands out in this dark, lonely world of The Return. And what affected me the most was when Heartbreaking started playing, and Cooper looked up, clearly being deeply affected. I can't explain it, I just almost started crying the first time I saw it. It felt like we were so, so far away from the warm 90s Twin Peaks (in a good way), and this ""realization"" look on Cooper made me feel like that good old Cooper was still somewhere deep within. Wonderful episode.

# #4: Pilot

One hella strong pilot. I was first introduced to Twin Peaks through film class where we were shown Part 8 of The Return. I obviously had no context and no idea what happened, but I LOVED the mood so much. I checked out Twin Peaks later, and was so surprised how the Pilot was compared to the lovecraftian episode we had seen in school. I was beyond excited about how the Pilot one day will turn into Part 8. The Pilot has everything; it sets up a huge mystery, and we actually get to spend time and FEEL the impact Laura's death has on the town. It makes us care so much more than if it went straight to the investigation. We are introduced to the wonderful, colorful cast of this town, including Dale Cooper, possibly the most likeable character in television. It even accidentially reveals the killed in the final shot. All in all, the Pilot sets up the mystery, it drags us deeply into Twin Peaks, and it introduces us to a hint of something supernatural.

# #3: No Knock, No Doorbell (The Return Part 16)

This really feels like a sort of finale or wrap-up in itself. Part 16 has so much going for it; the shootout with the Mitchum brothers present is both tense and hilarious. Richard's death is both brutal and confirms he's Mr. C's son. And of course, we have Cooper's awakening and the famous ""I AM the FBI"", aka one of the best moments in all of television. It's one of the first and only times we've felt true hope in The Return, a true safe connection to the warmth of S1 and 2. And it's through Cooper. On the dark side, the entire scene with ""Diane"" is so surreal, strange, eerie. The music, the red elevator, the tulpa's self awareness, her off-putting death as she flies away with The Return's famous ""bad"" SFX... it's all perfect. But even more terrifying is the ending. Audrey's mysterious journey comes to an end here. When the host announced Audrey's dance, I remember getting chills to an extent I rarely do. And when her theme started playing... It was utterly terrifying. And it's so brilliant. In the original, this theme was fun, uplifting, lighthearted. Here, it's something out of a nightmare. It just does not feel right. It feels like something is terribly wrong. What a haunting, beautiful scene. And of course, the final shot of her ""waking up"" and hearing the jazz band playing in reverse. It's pure horror and I fricking love it.

# #2: What Is Your Name? (The Return Part 18)

I could talk for hours about this episode. This is, in my opinion, the 100% perfect ending to Twin Peaks. Never have I felt anything remotely similar watching anything as I did watching this. Part 17 feels like the ""proper"" ending; plots come to an end, stories get wrapped up, the ""bad guy"" is defeated, Cooper is back, characters reunite. But it feels too easy, and I think that was the point. Even when the eerie ""We live inside a dream"" comes, we're still there with Cooper, and we feel somewhat safe. We get a wonderful, emotional scene with Laura that makes the entire show come full circle, but of course, the final minute makes this hopeful episode end on a haunting cliffhanger. Part 18 isn't anything close to hopeful or clear. I'm gonna be honest: Part 18 of The Return is the closest thing to a nightmare I've ever experienced put on screen. We're back with Mike in the red room, making us question if anything we've seen has truly happened. It makes us feel distanced, out of control, isolated, unsafe. Cooper and Diane cross over to ""somewhere else"", and it's haunting. It instantly turns night, their expressions are blank, and there's no music. From this point on, our final anchor of safety (Dale Cooper) is gone. He's not himself anymore, not fully. As he leaves the motel the next morning (now being referred to as Richard and being in a totally different motel than the night before), he drives to ""Judy's"", where again he's not Cooper anymore. The coffee doesn't taste great, he's brutal, serious in his tone, and is overall ""darker"". Then we have the meeting with Carrie Page. Eerie. As she says ""S-s-sarah..? What's going on...?"", it feels again like Twin Peaks is a distant, distant dream. It's surreal, uncomfortable. We also have the various references in her house to the rest of the sho.w

Then... The drive to Twin Peaks. Honestly a masterpiece on its own. We already feel completely distanced from the safe world of Twin Peaks and Cooper, and we're in the final 10-15 minutes of the FINALE of the show... and we're in a car. It's night, it's dark, and it's silent. Only the sound of the car can be heard. They drive for a long time, almost in complete silence. A car approaches from behind, like two eyes watching over them, and we never even know if that car is a random car, someone stalking them, or something else entierly. Maybe it's Alice Tremont passing them by... It's terrifying.

Finally, that ending. I can talk for hours about it as I said, so I'm just gonna say that the entire interaction with Alice is very off-putting. They leave, and it's silent once again. It's been silent almost the entire episode. Cooper finally asks ""What year is this?"" and the feeling of terrror I got the first time watching cannot be described. And finally, that hour of silence is completely shattered by Carrie's scream before the lights cut out and her scream echoes into the void. And I'm completely honest when I say that, the first time experiencing that scream and blackout, I got more chills than I've experienced - ever. Never in my life, from any song or film or experience, have I gotten that many chills. It was pure and utter terror at its its finest. I just sat there in shock. This may be my favorite ending of any show or film, simply because NOTHING has given me such an experience before. Again, it captured the feeling of a nightmare more accurately than anything else I've seen.

I can talk about the whole episode and how it basically contains everything that is Twin Peaks, but I want to purely focus on that ending. I think the entire sequence of the Roadhouse and Maddie's death can be classified as perfect. ""Something IS happening, isn't it Margaret?"" The reveal of Leland as Bob, the scratching sound of the record player, and the entire scene of the murder was brutal, shocking, unbelieveable. Twin Peaks had never gone to such lengths before, and it was executed perfectly. It cuts from this shocking sequence back to the Roadhouse with the dreamy ""The World Spins"" playing, and Cooper's shocked and confused expression. It goes from complete horror to a feeling of hopelessness and sadness. The old waiter coming over to say ""I'm so sorry""... I don't know why, but it hits so hard. And what pushes it over the edge for me is that both Bobby and Donna realizes deeply that something horrible has happened, and Donna starts hysterically crying - still with The World Spins playing over everything. It ends with Cooper looking up in a sort of acceptance, before everything turns red. What you're left with is disbelief. The episode perfectly allows the shock of the Maddie scene to sink in, both for you the viewer and for the characters at the Roadhouse. I think this is one of, if not THE best sequence in all of Twin Peaks, and for that alone I put it at Number 1.",1,1730122003.0,twinpeaks,0,1.0,False

1ge1y6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_lovehealgrow/comments/1ge1y6a/how_to_reconnect_after_a_friendship_grew_distant/,How to Reconnect After a Friendship Grew Distant,"https://preview.redd.it/5e7p6byi0ixd1.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=276a6be670a0e7bc33e4fe15120aeb5fa1efad47

Friendships are some of the most meaningful relationships we have, offering companionship, support, and shared memories. But life happens; people get busy, priorities shift, and sometimes, we unintentionally drift apart from friends. Maybe you were overwhelmed with life, and before you knew it, weeks turned into months or even years without contact. If you find yourself missing a friend you once ghosted and wanting to reconnect, you‚Äôre not alone. Rekindling a friendship after a period of distance can be challenging, but it‚Äôs also possible to rebuild that connection.

**Understanding Why Friendships Drift Apart**

It‚Äôs important to first acknowledge that drifting apart from a friend is a common experience. Life‚Äôs transitions‚Äì like moving to a new city, starting a new job, or dealing with personal challenges‚Äì can naturally lead to a decrease in communication. Sometimes, the distance wasn‚Äôt caused by a particular event but rather a gradual fading of contact.

Ghosting a friend doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that the friendship wasn‚Äôt valuable. In many cases, it‚Äôs simply a reflection of the complexities of adult life. However, when you find yourself missing that connection, it‚Äôs normal to feel a mix of emotions, like regret, guilt, and [**even anxiety**](https://www.lovehealgrow.com/what-is-friendship-anxiety/) about how to reestablish the bond. These feelings are valid and part of the process of rekindling a friendship.

**Tips for Rekindling a Stale Friendship**

Reconnecting with a [***friend you ghosted***](https://www.lovehealgrow.com/silent-treatment-within-relationships/) can feel daunting, but with the right approach, it‚Äôs possible to rebuild a meaningful connection. Here are some tips to help you navigate the process:

**Reflect on Your Motivations**

Before reaching out, take some time to reflect on why you want to reconnect with this particular friend. What do you miss about the friendship? Are you [***seeking closure***](https://www.lovehealgrow.com/coping-with-outgrowing-friendship/) for unresolved feelings, or do you genuinely want to rebuild the connection? Understanding your motivations can help you approach the situation with clarity and sincerity.

It‚Äôs also worth considering whether the friendship was [***healthy for both of you***](https://www.lovehealgrow.com/moving-on-after-friendship-breakup/). If there were unresolved issues or negative dynamics, think about whether you‚Äôre both in a place where you can move past them. Rekindling a friendship should be about fostering a positive and supportive relationship.

**Start with a Simple, Honest Message**

Making the first move is often the hardest part. Start with a simple, honest message that acknowledges the distance and expresses your interest in reconnecting. A text, email, or social media message can be a low-pressure way to reach out. You might say something like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking about you lately and realizing how much I miss our friendship. I‚Äôm sorry we lost touch. I‚Äôd love to catch up if you‚Äôre open to it.‚Äù

It‚Äôs important to acknowledge the time that has passed and to express genuine interest in how they‚Äôre doing. Avoid diving into heavy topics right away‚Äîkeep the initial message light and open-ended, giving them the space to respond in a way that feels comfortable to them.

**Manage Your Expectations**

When reconnecting with a friend after a period of distance, it‚Äôs crucial to manage your expectations. The friendship might not pick up exactly where it left off, and that‚Äôs okay. Both of you have likely grown and changed during the time apart, and it may take some time to find a new rhythm.

Be prepared for the possibility that the dynamic of the friendship could be different. They might be hesitant at first, or they might have moved on from the friendship in a way that makes rekindling it more challenging. It‚Äôs important to approach the situation with an open mind and a willingness to accept whatever response you receive.

**Address the Elephant in the Room**

If you ghosted the friendship, it‚Äôs likely that there‚Äôs some level of awkwardness or discomfort about the situation. Addressing this directly can help clear the air and pave the way for a more open and honest conversation. You might say something like, ‚ÄúI realize I dropped the ball on keeping in touch, and I‚Äôm really sorry about that. It wasn‚Äôt my intention to hurt you or let our friendship slip away.‚Äù

Acknowledging your role in the distance shows maturity and a willingness to take responsibility. It can also help reduce the awkwardness by putting everything out in the open, making it easier to move forward.

**Be Prepared for Awkwardness**

Let‚Äôs be honest: Rekindling a friendship after a period of distance can be awkward. There may be moments of discomfort, especially if there are unresolved feelings or if the conversation doesn‚Äôt flow as easily as it once did. This is normal, and it‚Äôs okay to acknowledge that it might take time to get back into a comfortable groove.

One way to reduce awkwardness is by focusing on shared interests or memories. Reminiscing about past experiences can help reestablish a connection and remind both of you why the friendship was meaningful. You can also plan a casual, low-pressure activity for your first meeting. Grabbing coffee or taking a walk together can provide a relaxed environment to ease back into the friendship.

**Rebuild the Connection Gradually**

Rekindling a friendship is a process that takes time. Don‚Äôt expect everything to fall back into place immediately. Instead, focus on gradually rebuilding the connection through consistent, meaningful interactions. This could involve regular check-ins, making plans to spend time together, or simply being there for each other in small but significant ways.

Consistency is key: showing up and putting in the effort to maintain the friendship demonstrates your commitment to rebuilding the bond. Over time, these small acts of connection can help strengthen the friendship and create a new foundation.

**Be Patient and Respect Their Pace**

It‚Äôs important to remember that your friend may need time to process their feelings and decide how they want to move forward. They might not be ready to dive back into the friendship right away, and that‚Äôs okay. Be patient and give them the space they need to figure out what they want.

Respecting their pace shows that you care about their feelings and are willing to rebuild the friendship on their terms. If they‚Äôre open to reconnecting, let the relationship develop naturally over time.

**Navigating the New Dynamic**

As you work to rekindle the friendship, it‚Äôs important to be mindful of the new dynamic. Both of you have likely grown and changed during the time apart, and the friendship may evolve in new and unexpected ways. Embrace these changes and be open to the possibility that the friendship might look different than it did before.

It‚Äôs also worth considering that some friendships are meant to be for a season, and it‚Äôs possible that the connection might not be as strong as it once was. If that‚Äôs the case, it‚Äôs okay to acknowledge the value of the friendship for what it was and to appreciate the growth you‚Äôve both experienced.

**Moving Forward with a Rekindled Friendship**

Reconnecting with a friend [***you ghosted***](https://www.lovehealgrow.com/coping-with-being-ghosted/) can be a deeply rewarding experience, offering a chance to rebuild a meaningful relationship and create new memories together. It‚Äôs a process that requires patience, honesty, and a willingness to embrace the awkwardness that might arise. By taking the time to reflect on your motivations and approaching the situation with care, you can rebuild a connection that enriches both of your lives.

If you‚Äôre finding it difficult to navigate the emotions involved in rekindling a friendship or if you‚Äôre struggling with unresolved feelings from past relationships, seeking support from a therapist can be incredibly helpful. Here at Love Heal Grow, our therapists want to support you through the complexities of friendships and help you build healthy, fulfilling relationships.

Almost back to the point, or maybe we can find one. This will be ongoing as I continue to learn more ridiculous traits that make me hate them. For today, one of my 2 biggest issues, the one that has got me uncomfortably close to another man's face as he yelled out his cigarette and coffee, stinched vagina stupidity, he felt the need for me to hear. (I wasn't really listening; I was ahead just a few minutes into the future, where I was beating the breaks off the dude in the parking lot (sadly, it didn't happen), so what did I do to make this ‚Äúreseller‚Äù so angry? I simply accidentally lacked his process scanning device that he was actively using inside the pre-purchase. Did I mean for it to hit the ground and crack the screen? Well, no, I didn't; I followed my procedure of politely whispering vulgarity about you cheating. My whisper was too low, so I walked by and informed him of your tampon string, then went on about my hunt. Wouldn't you know a couple of minutes later to say he just cannot pick out an item that possibly could generate profit without this little thing telling him that it currently is simply tapped out of his hand down to the floor, broke the screen, and quickly learned that that was his cell phone of a couple of weeks old? Well, don‚Äôt be a bitch and use it to cheat. If you purchase things at a thrift store, yard sale, or even clearance aisle with intention of using a platform to sell them, and you stink so badly you don't dare take the risk of spending the 3 dollars without knowing what the last 3 have sold for on the internet, well, you should go climb into the cardboard box in the back and take the device with you. And yes, I'm fully aware that this shouldn't bother me too much. I should inform them of their active status as douches, but ya, I can't; its cheating drives me insane. You‚Äôre depriving yourself of one of the greatest joys of this profession, at least mine. I don‚Äôt know if the resort is due, but pay for going out to the parking lot and literally scratching off your lottery tickets, but look at it, or you want to get real crazy, wait till it sells, and then see what you did. St. Vincent de Paul thrift stores have their issues, but the one thing they do get right, as I‚Äôve never been in one, is that a cell phone even gets any type of service to be able to look up anything anyway. He has some sort of blanket that I swear to God they do, so you can‚Äôt look up that stuff. I guess so much damn furniture, don‚Äôt worry about it. That was the scenic route with a first-hand account of my experience with one most recently seen one of those little bastards. Use a phone to cheat.

It was mostly small-talk but they made a point of telling a specific story about the previous owner of our house who apparently was a bit eccentric.

The story was a bit vague but it sounds like in order to build the extension (2004) he took down the original fence and asked permission to put scaffolding on the neighbour's land but when it was finished he re-built the fence-line at the edge of where the scaffolding was, effectively taking about 2ft of their land in the process, which now forms a narrow gravel path from the front to the rear of our house.  They said he explained to them that after he'd laid the foundations he realised he'd left the property with no access to the rear garden so he had to add this strip on to create the path to be able to finish the extension.  It sounds like they felt they were forced into this situation and weren't happy with it, but they didn't state this out loud.

They didn't say anything more about it, but it was weird that they made a point of saying this, like that was the real reason for inviting us round.

Looking in more detail, the land registry plans show the *original* boundary, running straight down the length of the plot, without the little 2ft x 30ft 'dog leg' that now forms the path beside the extension.

What position does this put me in?  Is there any scenario where this could cause us issues?

So I'm 21M, a university student. I have a huge crush on my classmate. And have already told her but she has said she doesn't like relationship stuff (I belong to Pakistan, a rather conservative society where relationships before marriage are not considered good let alone physical relationships). She is quite introvert and seems of good character. So I was quite heartbroken but I try doing different antics to impress her but she just laughs them off(not irritated) She has a very good male friend (another classmate) , who is tall+attractive. I always suspected that they both are together but he is in a relationship with some other girl and she doesn't go out with boys alone.

Now the main story is. 2 days ago, when our classes ended for the day, I saw them sitting in her car together and I got jealous AF so I put my scooty after them at a safe distance. They stopped outside some small house and went inside the gate. Now you can imagine my fury. I parked some yards away, and waited for a few minutes then climbed the wall.. I wanted to get inside the house at any cost, so I devised a quick plan and knocked on door. Till he came outside to check, I went to the back and hid there. He went back inside and then I knocked again and this time both of them scared and furious came outside and tried to check everywhere, leaving the main door open. I slowly slowly crawled away from wherever they were checking and when both of them were in backyard, I went inside the door. It was one bhk home, so I went quickly inside the only room and hid myself in the cupboard. They both came back and were in the living room. He was playfully teasing her. And she was saying that why he was with that other girl and didn't recognized her love earlier. Both were talking very sensually. (imagine my fury). Then she told him to be gentle as it was her first time and he said that he bet she wouldn't be able to walk on her legs afterwards. (imagine my fury). Then she asked him to wait there and she came to the room. She wore a very se#y make up and a sizzling bikini, and then asked him to come to the room. Then what i saw i couldnt believe my eyes, that she is the same naive girl. She danced for him on a really sensual song, and was literally behaving like a¬†[wh@re](mailto:wh@re). I peeked in from the cupboard all the time and boy oh boy. For the next 4 hrs, he literally busted every hole that she had in multiple positions and not once gently, and she was enjoying it AF. She kept moaning and screaming loudly and he kept banging her from left, right and centre. Especially when they were trying the ""other hole"", she literally bled. And even then he pounded her in that hole one more time. On the bed, on the couch, leaning on wall from behind.. in missionary, in doggy,.. THEY TRIED EACH FUC\*ING THING...she even jokingly said to him ""forget walking, i wont be able to sit properly for weeks now""...thats the level of pounding she had recieved....

I was like where the F did that introvert and shy girl has gone whom I loved. I used to be very respectful and gentle around her but during all this episode he wasn't once gentle with her and even slapped her hard when she was blowing him. So after all this (4 hrs had passed), they both went to the attached bathroom and she was literally not able to walk properly. After a minute or two, her moans started again. Here I was in the cupboard, with teary eyes and a huge boner. I quietly came outside and sneaked outside the main door and then climbed the wall again and got home. All the night I was having the worst wet dreams of my life involving both of them. Yesterday in the class, both of them arrived separately as usual and were behaving like nothing had happened. She was still not able to walk properly. She was with her female friends, and I was feeling the very urge to talk to her. So I asked her for notes and she gave me those. I couldn't control myself and asked if she would like a coffee in the Cafe and she smiled and said that I've told you earlier, I don't go out with boys alone. I kept quite.. But wtf bro... Tell me straight away that you don't like me rather not wanting a relationship with anyone.

I don't know if I'm horny, sad or heartbroken since 2 days. Probably a mixture of all feelings. This event has probably given me a trauma for whole life... I can't even eat or sleep properly... She was the only girl whom I had ever loved in my life... Does this happen with all nice guys??,

I (33F) just met a guy (33M) 13 days ago. I feel so dumb even posting this, but I am genuinely dumbfounded. Our first date was a coffee date and we sat and talked for 4 hours until I had to leave for work. He walked me to my car afterwards and gave me a kiss goodbye. We went and played pin ball that night and when I got home I was speechless. Speaking to my best friend that night, I literally couldn‚Äôt find words to describe how well I got along with this person and the instant connection we had. It was like a rom com sequence. I have NEVER had a reaction like this before. Bonding with someone so fast felt like a red flag but, I was just trying to let myself enjoy this. 

I am VERY apprehensive when dating and I never let myself get caught up in emotion, but this genuinely felt special. I usually refuse to put myself in a situation to get hurt.

We have the same sense of humor, similar values, comparable careers and education, and incredible physical chemistry. Every moment we‚Äôve spent together has been perfect. 

Then, he told me he would text me last night but never did. No big deal.. again. I realize I hardly know this person and he doesn‚Äôt owe me anything. I reached out once last night and once this morning and he finally got back to me and said his friends convinced him to go out and he was hungover this morning. Followed by those fateful words ‚Äúcan we talk?‚Äù

I went to his place and he essentially said that he has never felt anything like this before and he thought he might have found his person in me, so he was taking this really seriously but ultimately decided he didn‚Äôt see a future. We had an amazing time bowling on Wednesday. And apparently he made this decision on Friday and told me about it today.

Got three random texts in a row and then a phone call that was a number I (23m) didn't recognize. Didn't answer and read through the texts. Found out it was my stepsister (24f). Her car broke down, she was about 30 minutes from my place and her dad and my mom told her she could spend the night at my place and that I ""needed to come pick her up"". She called me again and I still didn't answer and I ignored her texts.

The next morning all hell broke loose. My mom called me a bunch of times and her husband was texting insults repeatedly at me. My mom asked me why I hadn't answered my phone or gone to pick my stepsister up. I told her I wasn't asked I was told and I do not welcome people in who I have a bad relationship with.

To sum up our relationship. We knew each other from kindergarten. We didn't start out a steps but as kids in the same school. By the time we were about 7 we had a very tense relationship. I don't know what started it but we fought a lot and it only got worse whenever we were put in the same class. My mom met her dad through the school calling them up and saying hey we need to talk about your kids, they fight a lot. Through that they started to like each other and began dating when we were 9ish. They got married 8 months later. Our dislike for each other did not change because we were supposedly family at that point. We went to therapy together and her dad sent us to this bonding camp thing where we had to do challenges each day for like a month in the hopes we would work together. I ended up with a dislocated shoulder from that because she refused to take part in one part of it and I fell. My mom put her foot down about it being the end of that. But we didn't even tolerate each other. It was either outright avoid and if we couldn't, there was tension, we glared.

We have not been in the same room since she moved out of my mom and her dad's house and went to live with a friend. 18 months ago I was in a pretty bad accident and spent some time in the hospital. No concern shown. She didn't call to find out how I was or come to see me. Did I care? No. But this is a point I will make because of the big deal about her staying at my place. We do not help each other or care what happens to each other and that's how it is on both sides, not just me. She had to get my number off my mom last week. She did not have it already.

Because I didn't answer or let her stay I was told I'm now a shitty, awful person and my mom's husband has asked repeatedly how I could do that to my ""sister"". My response to him was where was she when I was in the hospital. That was ignored. My stepsister ended up waiting in a coffee shop for her dad to make the 6 hour drive to her.

Adding extra detail I forgot in the main post: The texts/calls started at 10pm. Her car had broken down and she'd left a really shitty date and couldn't get a place to stay because everywhere was very busy because of two events going on. I found this out later.

I always felt super weird and out of place - social cues were hard for me. Impulsively issues made me do some cringey things. I made friends with the ‚Äúcool‚Äù people in school - this was my biggest goal as it would confirm the fact I was ok, there was nothing wrong with me. But of course even some of the cool people wanted nothing to do with me, kept me at a distance . 

I got into alcohol and drugs in my teens. I can‚Äôt pay attention well when people talk to me. People think I‚Äôm stupid. I can be naive and fall for things - people used to trick me for fun to get a laugh. I get stressed easily and I‚Äôm introverted but also very extroverted, I always enjoyed having friends to bounce ideas off. But why are others intentions never pure while mine are? It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm broken and attract mean people. Nice people I don‚Äôt ‚Äúclique‚Äù with or even feel awkward around. Why is that? 

Well after having my son my symptoms seemed to get worse. I felt really low motivation and decided to try medication (not my first rodeo - in the past I tried concerta and it was awful, I‚Äôve tried basically every SSRI - and, awful) 

So I got put on Vyvanse and at first I felt a great improvement. Only now, no matter how high a dose I crash mid day. That would be manageable  though it feels shitty, but I‚Äôm also getting more paranoid toward my partner and people in general. My social skills actually seem to be getting worse - at first they improved and now idk. I didn‚Äôt take my meds for work yesterday and felt like I did better socially. Though I felt depressed. I didn‚Äôt take my meds today and still I feel really sad, probably my body coming down from the stimulant. 

I guess I‚Äôm just venting because I feel like I have the type of ADHD that doesnt fit in with regular adhd people, my brain doesn‚Äôt work like ANYBODYS. I‚Äôm not saying this as an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so different‚Äù‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm actually wondering if anyone else feels the same way and what they did? It‚Äôs frustrating because no meds seem to have the effect I‚Äôm looking for - a clear mind, focused, relaxed, happy & motivated. I love surfing, and art, and cleaning, and skateboarding, cooking can be fun. I have a lot of interests but anxiety and perfectionism and holding myself to this impossible standard makes me give up on things and I try and push through but everything feels so much harder for me because I have social and performance anxiety to contend with. 

I‚Äôm actually considering quitting coffee, stimulants, sugar, and eating clean and seeing what that does for me. But also it‚Äôs a lot of work - I already quit drinking, smoking cigarettes, I‚Äôm like ugh I have to give up evening snacks and obsess over my diet now too? Like why can‚Äôt anything just be easy? 

So yeah I just had an insane paranoid episode I always think my fiance is cheating on me or up to something , or doesn‚Äôt really love me, the Vyvanse seems to be making that feeling worse as I ruminate and get in my head.  ",7,1730120525.0,adhd_anxiety,0,1.0,False

1ge1fa3,https://www.reddit.com/r/doctorsUK/comments/1ge1fa3/new_frca_revision_resource_moderator_approved/,New FRCA Revision Resource [Moderator Approved],"Dear all and, in particular, anaesthetic trainees,

I am filled with both excitement (and also much trepidation) to be 'officially' launching my website:

[https://frcanotes.com](https://frcanotes.com) 

Below are some anticipated 'FAQs'.

**What is it?**

A free, open-access, bespoke FRCA Exam revision resource.

**Why build it?**

The number of disparate resources required to cover the FRCA examination curriculum is unwieldy. Furthermore, resources tend to be out-of-date (most textbooks, some e-LFH modules), expensive (apps, books, courses), piecemeal (e.g. needing a physics *and* physiology *and* pharmacology *and* equipment textbook/BJAEd), non-specific to the FRCA or just outright extinct (frca.co.uk - RIP). 

Other, similar exams such as the N. American boards or the ANZ CICM exams benefit from single (or few) bespoke resources e.g. Deranged Physiology. 

The site aims to cut through all that as it is bespoke to the exam and curriculum-tailored to ensure all the necessary material is covered. 

I hope that, in time, the site will become *the* one-stop-shop revision resource for all things FRCA.

**Why is it better than what's out there?**

All in one place.

Free.

Tailored to the curricula.

Source material linked at the top of the page.

**Why are you releasing it if it isn't complete?**

The site takes time to build and I have many plates to spin. 

The site is now in my eyes a 'minimum viable product' with regards to the Final FRCA section, which is nearing completion. I hope that between now and the time it will take me to finish the Primary FRCA section, people will derive benefit from using frcanotes.com.

**How much does it cost?**

The website is free. The purpose is to reduce barriers to high-quality resource, not raise them. If you want to contribute to the website's running costs, please click the 'Buy Me A Coffee' button on the bottom of the home page.

**Why are there no past questions?**

I would either need to hoik questions from other sources (plagiarism issues) or write my own (time constraints) so at present I am focussing on getting all the relevant material on the site first and will address this in future.

**I don't like the '*****insert quibble'.***

I am aware of some minor formatting issues; these are on the to-do list to fix.

I am aware of the text-heavy nature of the material; this reflects my own notes. I intend to add multimedia in future although this will also require navigation of copyright issues so as with other aspects requiring improvement it is on the 'to do' list.

The colour scheme is based off the RCoA's so if you're displeased with that particular aesthetic aspect please take it up directly with the college. 

**I want to provide feedback, comments or help expedite things**

I am keen to know if there are obvious grammatical errors, function issues or other aspects compromising usability. Please email me at frcanotes1@gmail.com.

I am keen to know if there are (clinical) topics which you feel should be included but aren't; please email me with the topic *and* the relevant curriculum item.

Please email me if you find any clinically inaccurate information. However I am **not** keen to hear ""*you're wrong because for patients with aortic regurgitation I give them a paracetamol suppository pre-induction to keep their heart rate up and then 30mg ephedrine IM at closure to avoid hypotension in recovery*"".

You would need to provide proof of your credentials. You would receive in return a letter of thanks and your name on the relevant pages of the website. 

If you are senior surgical registrar or consultant and you've made it this far then 1) well done and 2) if you too would like to help out by peer-reviewing surgical aspects of the site then the same applies as above.

***It was October 28, 2028, when the world changed forever.***



***I remember that night vividly‚Äîgray clouds hanging low in the sky, suffocating everything below. The air was thick with a restless tension, the kind that makes your skin crawl for no particular reason. I had settled into my usual routine, brewing a late-night coffee as the TV flickered with its usual banal news chatter. But that night was different. That night, the screen started glitching, displaying a series of static frames before cutting to black. My heart sank a bit, thinking it was just some electrical glitch, but it wasn't.***



***Just as I reached for the remote to turn it off, a high-pitched whine pierced the air. The screen came alive again, but it was no longer the familiar, comforting faces of the news anchors. Instead, it was a military broadcast, black and white, with bold letters reading:***



***\*\*""EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM: IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED.""\*\****



***I stared at the screen, waiting for it to pass. For the first time, it didn't. A voice I didn‚Äôt recognize came on, a woman speaking with such a cold detachment that it sounded rehearsed.***



***\*""This is not a test. Hostile nations have engaged in a conflict of unprecedented scale. This is a global emergency.""\****



***The broadcast went on, saying that NATO and Russia, after decades of tension, had finally crossed the line. With alliances fractured and new powers emerging, a web of battles had erupted across Europe, Asia, and even parts of South America. Every major city was on high alert. Martial law was in effect. She listed major cities where bombings had already taken place‚ÄîParis, Berlin, New Delhi, Moscow. But what came next made my blood run cold.***



***\*""Biological and chemical weapons have been deployed,""\* she announced, her tone never wavering. \*""Stay indoors. Close all windows. Cover your mouth and nose if you must go outside. Symptoms of exposure include disorientation, auditory hallucinations, and in some cases, extreme aggression.""\****



***She repeated the instructions three times before the screen went black.***



***---***



***Days passed, then weeks. There was no power, no water, no government aid, no evacuation plans. We were alone, left to survive. Outside, the world was a wasteland. Those who had managed to survive in the immediate aftermath were scavenging, trying to avoid military drones that flew overhead day and night. They carried with them a terrifying, unmistakable hum, like a swarm of metallic bees. Some drones were programmed to capture footage, others to enforce curfews, and some‚Ä¶ well, I didn't know what they were for, and I didn‚Äôt want to find out.***



***About a month in, something strange started happening.***



***At night, a low, static hum would drift from abandoned radios, speakers, and even old telephones. Those who dared to turn the dials swore they heard fragments of human speech‚Äîpeople talking in frantic, panicked whispers, sometimes laughing in ways that made their voices sound twisted, distorted, like a broken record playing in reverse.***



***It wasn‚Äôt long before stories started circulating. They said that if you listened to the static for too long, you‚Äôd start hearing things you shouldn‚Äôt‚Äîlost voices of family members calling out to you, warning you to leave, or begging you to stay. Sometimes, they‚Äôd tell you to \*look outside.\****



***Curiosity got the best of me one night. I tuned my battered old radio to a dead frequency, letting the static roll over me like a wave. At first, it was just noise. But soon, something strange happened.***



***\*‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù\* a soft voice came through, almost pleading. \*‚ÄúYou have to listen.‚Äù\****



***I froze, heart hammering in my chest. It was a woman‚Äôs voice, gentle yet filled with urgency.***



***\*‚ÄúThey know where you are. They know everything. Do not trust the broadcasts. Do not trust the military. They are not here to save you.‚Äù\****



***The voice faded, but the message burned in my mind. I turned the radio off, half hoping I‚Äôd imagined it. But there was no denying what I‚Äôd heard. It wasn‚Äôt static; it wasn‚Äôt interference. Someone, somewhere, was trying to warn us.***



***---***



***After that, I started noticing other things, unsettling things. People I‚Äôd known all my life seemed to‚Ä¶ change. It was subtle at first‚Äîa glassy look in their eyes, a delayed reaction to simple questions. Then it became more obvious. They would stand still for hours, staring at nothing, muttering under their breath. Some would wander aimlessly, eyes glazed, as if in a trance. The worst were those who had taken to carving strange symbols into the walls of their homes, symbols I‚Äôd never seen before‚Äîspirals, eyes, hands. A language, maybe, or a message. They became known as ‚ÄúThe Marked.‚Äù***



***Rumors spread about The Marked. They were agents of some higher power, some dark force released during the bombings. Others said they were experiments, victims of chemical exposure twisted into something‚Ä¶ else. But one thing was clear: they weren‚Äôt human anymore.***



***One night, I heard tapping at my window. My heart sank as I cautiously pulled back the curtain. There, outside my window, was my neighbor‚Äîa quiet man named Harold who had kept to himself mostly. His face was pale, his eyes hollow, and his mouth‚Ä¶ his mouth was pulled into a grotesque smile, wide and unsettling. His fingers were bleeding, nails torn from tapping on the glass so insistently.***



***‚ÄúCome outside,‚Äù he said in a sing-song voice that sounded almost childish. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs safe now. Come outside.‚Äù***



***I backed away, heart pounding. He kept tapping, whispering to me over and over, ‚ÄúCome outside.‚Äù***



***When I refused, he grew silent, and I thought he‚Äôd finally left. But when I looked back, I saw him, standing still, watching my house from the street. He stayed there all night.***



***---***



***More weeks passed, and the broadcasts resumed. This time, they were different. It was a new voice‚Äîa man‚Äôs, deep and soothing. He spoke as if addressing children, his words slow and deliberate.***



***\*""You are safe. The worst has passed. It is time to come together, to rebuild.""\****



***But there was something in his tone, a certain emptiness that sent a chill down my spine. People who were still in hiding began to emerge, gathering in public places, like the broadcast voice had instructed. They were like sheep, drawn to the voice, hypnotized by it.***



***One night, the voice changed again. It was the same man, but now he sounded‚Ä¶ unhinged. There was a wild, almost frantic edge to his words.***



***\*""The world as you knew it is gone. You belong to us now. Serve us, obey us, and you will live.""\****



***The next morning, those who had obeyed the broadcasts, the ones who went out, didn‚Äôt come back. The streets were littered with abandoned clothes, shoes, belongings. It was as if they had simply vanished, leaving only the remnants of who they‚Äôd once been.***



***---***



***By the end of winter, most people were either dead or ‚ÄúMarked.‚Äù I was part of a small group that had learned how to survive‚Äîavoiding the streets, hiding during the broadcasts, never speaking of what we‚Äôd seen outside. We shared stories around flickering candles at night, stories of people who‚Äôd gone mad, of shadows that seemed to move on their own, of creatures that prowled the empty streets after sundown.***



***One night, as we huddled together, a woman named Leah pulled a small, crumpled piece of paper from her pocket. It was a note she‚Äôd found in her brother‚Äôs coat after he‚Äôd disappeared. The handwriting was messy, the ink smudged, but we could make out a few words:***



***\*""They are not who they say they are. They are not from here.""\****



***She looked up, tears in her eyes, whispering, \*""What does it mean?""\****



***None of us knew. We didn‚Äôt want to know.***



***---***



***Now, it‚Äôs been a year since the war began, and it feels as though the world has slipped into some kind of nightmare. I‚Äôm the last one left of my group. The others vanished, one by one, each drawn by the broadcasts or by strange whispers in the night.***



***I‚Äôm writing this, hoping someone will find it, someone who can understand what happened here. Maybe there‚Äôs a place untouched by the horrors, a place where people still live as they once did, unaware of the madness that has gripped the world.***



***As I write, I hear footsteps outside my door. They‚Äôre slow, deliberate, drawing closer with each passing second. I know better than to open it, but my hands tremble as the handle begins to turn.***



***A voice whispers through the crack, soft and coaxing.***



***\*""Come outside.""\****



***The footsteps stop, and I feel a chill run through me. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs night or day, I don‚Äôt know if help will ever come. All I know is that something‚Äîsomeone‚Äîis waiting for me just beyond that door.***



***And it won‚Äôt stop calling my name.***",1,1730120380.0,DrCreepensVault,0,1.0,False

From the moment I awaken, I am consumed by the unstoppable pull of my addiction. With shaking hands, I grab my phone and log in to the online casino, seeking relief in this digital empire of false promises and fleeting highs.

As I finish my morning coffee, I find myself lost in desperation and despair, chasing that big win, while drowning in the depths of guilt, anxiety, and shame. I can't breath and it‚Äôs time to go to work. As I walk, I browse through loan provider websites, planning what to lie this time and where to get some more money to found my daily pursuit of ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù.

Istart my ‚Äúwork‚Äù, I log in to an online casino on my phone, depositing all my money I have left and setting up auto spins. I place the phone within sight so I can constantly watch the ongoing hell of my life. The money ran out, I have to make a bit of effort to secure new financing.

After work, I am so happy and excited by the fact that my partner going to be on the evening shift: that meant a free game night. I could lay down on the couch, chill out, and revel in gaming. No need to suffer from ‚Äústomach issues‚Äù all night and sneak into the bathroom with my phone.

With each bet, I am drawn deeper into my bubble world.  In the dim glow of the screen, I lose myself in a maze of flashing lights and spinning reels, chasing the that one big win which seems to be always slightly out of reach.

With each loss, I am reminded that my addiction has taken on my life, my relationships shattered, my dreams broken. And yet still I tap the screen, unable to stop.

As the day wears on, the weight of my addiction grows ever heavier, anxiety is too heavy to bear alone.I throw up. In bed Im terrified. My mind is consumed with thoughts of fear, discuss, shame, anxiety, guilt. There is no way out I want to die. Ifell asleep. In my dreams my only companions are the ghosts of my past and the demons of my present‚Ä¶

1ge17zr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ge17zr,Markings in my coffee cup. ,"I've been practicing traditional tea leaf readings on friends recently (normally do tarot). But I'm aware coffee grounds work to. This was my own cup from this morning and I never sat with the intention of doing a reading. However I did sit mindfully in bed this morning when drinking my coffee, reflecting on subconscious thoughts about some vivid dreams I've been having, and corresponding with a spiritual reader I'm booking in with after a recommendation. After I finished my coffee I noticed these markings. Personally I've found references on tea leaf readings and their meanings very limited, and practicing tarot myself I've learnt to go with my intuitiveness more. But even with intuition I'm struggling to figure out what it means. 
What I see in my cup:

Blue: A large dogs head. 
Orange: Spirit figures. 
Green: A upside down fetus (like you'd see on a ultrasound).
Red: A skull like image with a hand going to mouth/chin.
Yellow: Something screaming. 
Also right side of the yellow I see the dulux paint dog with a hat on. 

Overall I don't really get a good feeling about these images, and that's not normally like me. I'm a silver lining, see the optimism in everything, glass half full type of person. So I hope I am just overthinking things a little bit.

I tried out lots of different churches before coming back to the Catholic Church- Namely non-denominational churches . I found that the non-denom churches often have a really good social atmosphere, theres coffee before and after the church and multiple groups held outside or after church like teen clubs/20's-30's friendship groups, bible studies, even just meetup groups ectect I really enjoyed this social aspect but I couldn't ignore the weak or outright incorrect theology so I left and came back to my Catholic roots .

Now I'm at a lovely cathedral and it has a large turnout every Sunday to the point I often have to stand up even if I get there on time lol It's mainly families or elderly people (from the UK so congregations of all churches do lean older) but there were a few younger people dotted about - I'd love to make friends at church but my parish doesn't really have any events going on, theres no coffee meetups or groups (theres KoC but im a woman), the parish Facebook page isn't really active (one post every week or so but it's usually an image of a scripture rather than events/news and its liked 1-3 times), the ""young / professional meetup"" type facebook groups havent been active since 2019 ect

The mass ends and people almost run out rather than stay and chat a little which does make sense, people are busy ect - But im having a hard time chatting to people , even during the sign of peace, people just sorta nodded their heads at me, instead of shaking my hand, even if they were right besides me and don't even try to mouth ""peace be with you"", just mouth closed and a tiny nod, I get not shaking hands post-covid but it's like everyone tries to avoid each other as much as possible ?

I have ADHD, so do struggle with a constant need for stimulation/ dopamine and so find myself repeating behaviours that I know drain me like too much phone time, listening to music all day every day and eating overly rich foods. 

But for the most part I'm very health conscious and aware of the things I consume. 

Then comes Friday night and suddenly all I want to do is get drunk, spend all my money and get 'out of my mind' on a dancefloor, someone's kitchen or my own house. Weekend evenings are inevitably spent intoxicating myself somehere, I might manage a hike or a day trip on a good day, then Sundays it's weed, movies and junk food. Monday it's deep regret and a feeling that I am not achieving what I want because of this weekly blowout. 

I suspect that perhaps living in such a restricted way in the week makes me crave this release so intensely, coupled with the fact I live in a city that is renowned for its partying (Bristol, UK) and all my friends socialise by drinking, sniffing cocaine and taking other substances, especially in the long winters when there isn't much to do outside. 

I'm also aware I'm maybe just being hard on myself and I'm just in the process of finding the right balance between enjoying life and being disciplined. 

But I deeply feel like I'd like to cut alcohol at some point, but I'm not sure how at this point. 

After this weekend I looked at my bank account and realised I spent everything I saved this month on tickets, alcohol, food and taxis. Enough is enough. 

I've come to this community becuase I think there are people here who have struggled with this, or still are, and can offer advice, words of wisdom, support or ways to get a release that isn't so harmful to my health and finances.

1ge0x2v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ge0x2v,"Got Jasper's Embark results back! Barely anything like the ""breeder"" claimed","Hi! I posted in another sub a while back asking about Jasper's (7 months old) potential breed mix. I was told he was a beagle/husky mixed with a bunch of little dogs - pug, Chihuahua, cavalier king charles spaniel, some others. I doubted some of those (specifically ckc and husky), so I decided to get him embarked.

I still haven't gotten over the shock lol. Now that I know he's part husky and dachshund, it makes total sense! He's got the eyes of course, as well as the fluffy curled tail and long, low body. He's not necessarily the smartest boy to ever live, but he makes up for it by being stubborn as a mule sometimes and as bidable as can be if I've bribed him with enough snacks. He's very gentle and playful, and the most vocal dog I've ever known! He doesn't bark unless someone knocks on the door, but he whines and hotels and grunts and groans constantly throughout the day. He even talks in his sleep lol. 

He's the most perfect little mutt I could've hoped for, and a healthy lil guy too! I just wish I could stop him from stealing food off the coffee table, but that's a work in progress.

1ge0uej,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1ge0uej/i_have_outgrown_my_friends_and_dont_feel/,I have outgrown my friends and don‚Äôt feel relatable anymore ,"So here‚Äôs some background about my situation. I have always never had good lasting friendships. We always fall apart for some or other reason( nothing serious). So I have never had good close friendships ever. 
Fast forward to when I joined my current company I met a couple of people we got along well and used to go to eat outside of office ( which was near by office) sometimes and had good times. I never really thought about this as a deep connection of friendship or anything like that. I fact I never really thought about this relationship at all. Fast forward to couple of years we are all still at the same company and they feel like we are besties. But I beg to differ. I did at some point feel connected to them but mind you all this is just at work. We never hung out outside work. 

Couple of years later now, they always refer to us as besties and that we are really close. But couple things that make me not feel connected at that level still. We never hang out outside work. Even when we do it‚Äôs at the time that is very convenient like right after work and somewhere close by so we don‚Äôt have to put so much effort into it. We never meet on the weekends. We never meet  for coffee or lunch or dinner. We never go to each others houses. 
The more I think about it the more faults I find. I feel like one of them is almost like not happy with the things I‚Äôm doing. Like if I say I‚Äôm travelling to xyz country her face literally goes pale. Samething when I say I got promoted. I wouldn‚Äôt say she is jealous but I wouldn‚Äôt say she is happy either. And also that we don‚Äôt like the same things. I like to meet over coffee and chill and spend time but she never wants to meet one on one. I want to travel and build memories but she doesn‚Äôt want to go without the whole group (it‚Äôs 5 in total). 
So it‚Äôs like the whole group doesn‚Äôt want to hang unless all of them are going. But there are times when I haven‚Äôt been able to make it but they still went out. Sooo things like this that not feeling happy for me or not liking the same things as me (basically not the same vibe) has me thinking that we are just co workers who get along well. Not best friends. 
They have checked in on my in some of my difficult times but I feel like friendships for me is what I described above. You are not really close friends if you just want to hang out when it is convenient and not put effort to meet outside work. Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking it maybe it‚Äôs not what I think it is. Idk just wanted to get this off my mind. 
On top of all this we are all at different points in our lives right now wrt to marriage and starting family so it is even more hard to make plans to meet that work. 

PS - in the early years I also couldn‚Äôt go out to hang or on trips because of strict parents. So I never felt the lack of it. But now that I can go out I realised that they have been slacking. I think it‚Äôs more to do with my requirements changing more than them. They are still the same. But I want to do more things now and so there‚Äôs the disconnect and that also made me realise the lack of effort from their end. ",1,1730118732.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,1.0,False

I write code for a living, and I often had youtube for LoFi, Spotify for ambient sounds, some random pomodoro timer on and writing notes wherever to stay on top of my work. It wasn't working great anyways but I often felt it was ""good enough"" and sometimes even anxious about all the moving parts and focus shift that came from that.

I finally decided enough was enough and built a better way to listen to LoFi and act as my ""remote work buddy"". I tried to build the UI to be as simple as possible with no ads and no distractions. You don't even have to log in to use the music or the timers.

For me, getting in the ""flow"" has never been easier before this app.

With the app you can:

Listen to hundreds of hours of LoFi music with different subgenres in the app and embedded Spotify playlists,  
Listen to ambient sounds that can be layered with the music,  
Enjoy the 4k animated backgrounds,  
Use Pomodoro/Countdown/Stopwatch timers,  
Save your notes with statuses,  
Save your favourite links,  
Use chatGPT.

  
Please try it out :)

Most of them are pretty obvious, now that I think about it.

**Weapons**

1. Tapping your pickaxe/terrain scanner/laser pointer key when you've reloaded your magazine, but the reload animation is still playing will cancel the rest of the animation, allowing you to shoot earlier. Try it out on the Warthog and Lok-1!
2. Want to choose which sentry you place down with Gemini System? Just tap reload and it'll swap the options - your chosen sentry's name will be highlighted.
3. Holding your Interact key when falling through a Zipline/falling onto a pipeline will cause you to latch onto them automatically, cancelling your fall damage (fall damage is based on velocity and not distance travelled).
4. Most ways of ""movement without your movement keys"" allow you to escape the Drop Pod during Extraction. The easiest way to do this is by placing a Zipline leading from inside the Drop Pod to outside, but it also works with RJ250 Compound if you prefire a round before sprinting into the green zone. Do not try this if you're the only one in the pod - if it comes back empty the mission will be counted as a loss.
5. The Colette Wave Cooker and Nishanka Boltshark X-80 have ‚Äúgunsling‚Äù animations (animations that play when you press the reload key while the magazine is full) but no one ever sees them because you need to unequip your T4 mod and T1 mod respectively. Or run out of ammo.
6. The Hurricane also has a unique gunsling animation when you're very, very low/dry on rockets.
7. The Mole overclock boasts the highest potential damage in the game - infinity. Theoretically, anyway.
8. Inversely, the lowest damage that isn't zero can be achieved with a Marked For Death build with no damage upgrades, which deals 1.1 damage on the first focus shot.
9. The Minigun and Zhukovs have doubled RoF - that is, they spend two ammo to fire one bullet, which is reflected in their ammo count, magazine size, RoF etc. So if a friend sends you a photo in which he has an odd number of Minigun ammo, you can accuse him of doctoring it, and he‚Äôd probably block you, and for good reason.

10 - 14. There are:

3.62 √ó 10¬π‚Åµ ways to build Driller,

2.31 √ó 10¬π‚Åµ ways to build Engineer,

5.25 √ó 10¬π‚Å¥ ways to build Gunner,

and 7.516 √ó 10¬π‚Åµ ways to build Scout.

(not counting Paintjobs and Frameworks)

[(source and elaboration)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/1ekl2z0/the_power_of_10_drgs_total_build_combinations_and/)

15. You can turn off your HUD by holding down the H key, and your flashlight by holding down the F key.

Several weapon names have little jokes in them:

16. The Lok-1 Smart Rifle can be read as either ‚ÄúLock-On‚Äù or ‚ÄúLoki‚Äù. The debate is ongoing to this day.

17. The BRT7‚Äôs name can be read as ‚ÄúBRRT‚Äù, which is the sound the gun makes when it goes ‚Äúbrrrt‚Äù.

18. If it wasn't obvious from its classic ‚Äúping‚Äù, the M1000 is a reference to the M1 Garand (M1-Grand).

19. The word ""Zhuk"" (""–∂—É–∫"" in Russian) translates to ""bug"" or ""beetle"" (word ripped straight from the wiki).

20. The Nishanka Boltshark X-80‚Äôs name can be read as CROSS (X) - BO (80).

**Enemies**

21. The planet ""Navi VII"" in the Glyphid Stalker log is a reference to Helldivers II. In what context, I don't know because I've never played Helldivers.

22. Bulk Detonators will not release their instakill explosion when frozen, but rather, a high-knockback fart.

23. The Crassus Detonator's name is a reference to [Marcus Licinius Crassus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Licinius_Crassus), who died by having molten gold poured down his throat.

24. The Crassus Detonator also has the highest effective health of any enemy, with 14875 EHP on Haz 5 Tough Enemies II with 4 players.

25. Inversely, the Maggot has the lowest health, with an earth-shattering 1 no matter what.

26. When a boss's healthbar is gray, it's invincible. Fairly simple, but I've seen too many greenbeards shoot the Twins while they're healing not to put this here.

27. Speaking of the Twins, they heal their health back. Spread your damage between the two equally.

28. To dodge Tri-Jaw shots very reliably, run straight towards them.

29. The Mactera Brundle's name is a reference to Dr. Brundle from [The Fly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fly_(1986_film)).

30. Shellbacks, both adult and baby, will ""T-Pose"" upon death on Volatile Guts missions.

31. Spitballer, Barrage Infector and Korlok shots can be shot down. Driller's Drills can form a ""shield"" of damage that allows him to instantly destroy Spitballer shots if your ping is low enough.

32. Nemesis will moan a depressing voiceline or pop culture reference when defeated, such as ""This wasn't a triumph"".

33. Rockpox enemies will always take extra damage from Bullets of Mercy on the GK2.

34. You can pet all sorts of cute things: Lootbugs, Breathers, Hexawing Gniffers, Hack-C, etc.

35. You can grab onto Cave Angels for a ride, but they'll throw you off after some time.

**Space Rig**

36. Throwing mugs/disco balls into the barrel hoop count for 1 point, throwing the hammer (near the forge) inside will display ""Hammer Time"", and throwing a Data Cell inside (only in S1/S2 Space Rigs, on a chair in the medbay) will cause the display to glitch out.

37. The names that appear on your Jetty Boot machine and slowly obscure your high score until only the blight remains are the names of some of the developers (e.g. Phil & Mekill). If you get a high enough score, they're said to be permanently banished, but achieving such dark power is beyond me.

38. The statues in the Memorial Hall hold beta versions of the classes' weapons. Take a look at the number of barrels on the Minigun, for example.

39. Underhill Deluxe‚Äôs description is a direct parody of the first paragraph of the first book of the Lord Of The Rings.

40. Pots of Gold only applies to gold mined by hand. Gold blown up by C4, mined by Bosco etc. don't benefit from it.

41. There is a typo in Randoweisser's description.

**Minerals**

42. Repeatedly pinging Compressed Gold, Bittergem, and/or special Mushrooms in Fungus Bogs (you'll know when you ping them and say ""Mushroom"") has a chance to piss off Mission Control.

43. ERR://23¬§Y%/, or Error Cubes, have no purpose other than to give you a smidgen of XP and spawn ten posts monthly about ""what is this"" on the subreddit. Your collection can be viewed at the Cosmetic Terminal.

**Cave Bits**

44. An endless swarm will start upon calling the Drop Pod. This includes sending off the Minehead, so do events before refining.

45. Point Extraction has special swarm scaling that causes more bugs to spawn as more time goes on.

46. Mini-Mules will give you a bit of Nitra and Gold when they're repaired, which is partially to compensate for the small swarm that triggers when you approach them.

47. Speaking of free crap, Rusty Resupply Pods can spawn on Salvage missions, which can be found by digging them out randomly or by looking for the tunnel they whittled out on your terrain scanner. They have a 60% chance to give you one resupply, a 15% chance for two, and a 25% chance for absolutely nothing.

48. Cobwebs can be incinerated to be destroyed.

49. p\[\[\[\[\[\[\[{0}\]\]\]\]\]\]\]q is a bunch of sparky pillars in Azure Weald that provides 50% damage resistance to all creatures that step through it, which can be seen from the glowy orbs. They persist for 15 seconds after leaving the ring, and this structure also has the side effect of giving Error Cubes a run for their money in the amount of times they get posted monthly.

50. Elevator Plants in Dense Biozone will scream upon destruction.

51. Glow Trees can be lit up by hitting/shooting the bulbs, and doing this to all five bulbs will permanently light up the tree.

52. There is an exceedingly small chance for a speckled white Mushroom in Fungus Bogs to spawn. I had two spawn side by side once, but they got obliterated by an Exploding Plant.

53. Steam Vents and Lava Geysers will explode violently upon destruction.

**Miscellaneous**

54. The golden rule in this game - or any game, really, is to keep moving whenever possible. Run, jump, climb, surf, anything to maintain your distance from enemies.

55. By pressing your Interact key with your laser pointer out, you can set a ""waypoint"" that'll be visible on your terrain scanner and laser pointer until you set a new one.

56. Pressing spacebar when you're holding the terrain scanner out will orient you in the direction that you're facing in the scanner.

57. Bosco can do multiple things that you may not have known of, such as building pipelines, fixing pipelines, vacuuming Lithofoam, and mining Beamers in the Heartstone fight. All that, and yet he still can't pick up Fossils...

58. Re-Atomizer used to allow you to inflict the ""Steeve"" status effect onto anything. This didn't turn them friendly, but did give them Steve's massive damage reduction against Dwarf firearms. Now think of that, but with a Bulk or a Dreadnought.

59. Flares (the things that pop out when you press F, not Scout's utility) used to have upgrades in beta.

60. Beastmaster allows you to tame not just the Grunts, but the Slashers and Guards too.

61. Obtaining even just one health when under the effects of Iron Will will prevent you from going back down when the effect wears off.

62. The Drop Pod doors will automatically open at the eleventh hour, even if if Molly hasn't docked yet for whatever reason.

63. The name of the first ever Deep Dive was ""Hard Blade"".

64. Several dwarf voicelines are pop culture references: ""For those about to Rock (and Stone) we salute you"", ""Look at me, I'm Stony Rock (Tony Hawk, pro skater)"" etc. and cosmetics are also pop culture references. Which ones, I can't say because I can't make heads or tails of those darn youngsters' lingo.

65. You may have seen people with a yellow name and pickaxe badge in-game, who've purchased one of the Supporter Packs. However, have you seen people with a blue name and camera badge (Streamers) or someone with a green name and a ""Dev"" icon (Developers)?

66. Basically nothing is timegated - you can get almost any hat or cosmetic that you want, as long as you complete the relevant assignment/fork over some cash, ingame or irl/get incredibly popular on Twitch. The exceptions to this rule are the anniversary hats, the Steamy Helmet, the Head Honcho, and two viking helmets given out during the Steam Awards.

67. All the dwarves are just one dude pitched up/down. Mission Control is voiced by another guy, who also happens to be the Art Director.

68. Other Coffee Stain Studio games, like Satisfactory and Goat Simulator 3, have DRG references - I haven't played either, but from what I've seen Satisfactory has an achievement and a collectible in the world while GS3 has a beard and Molly in its DLC.

69. Do not use the Fandom wiki. Seriously.

I wanted to share something that helped me find strength during one of the hardest times in my life. After experiencing a major loss, I felt completely lost and broken. It was like a part of me had been taken away, and I couldn‚Äôt imagine ever feeling whole again.

One day, someone close to me gave me a piece of advice that didn‚Äôt magically fix everything but helped me start putting the pieces back together: ‚ÄúFocus on rebuilding one small part of your life at a time.‚Äù

At first, it was as simple as getting out of bed, then doing small things like making a cup of coffee, going for a short walk, or even just writing down one thing I was grateful for each day. These little acts seemed insignificant, but slowly, they gave me a sense of progress, however tiny it was. Each small step reminded me that life could still move forward, even if it was at my own pace.

The journey wasn‚Äôt linear; there were still hard days and setbacks. But eventually, those small actions built a foundation of strength that helped me start focusing on the present rather than feeling trapped in my loss.

If you‚Äôre going through something difficult, please remember that healing doesn‚Äôt have to happen all at once. Give yourself permission to take small steps and allow yourself to feel whatever you need to feel along the way. And if anyone here wants to share what‚Äôs helped them or needs a listening ear, I‚Äôm here for you. Feel free to reach out or PM me if you need someone to talk to without judgment.

We‚Äôre all in this together, and you‚Äôre not alone.

I had promised to myself last Saturday that I would spend the whole Sunday (yesterday) to study. But when the day came, I spent my time sleeping and procrastinating. By evening I had told myself that I would start studying after having dinner with my friends. I also bought coffee para magkagana akong mag aral once na makauwi ako. But when I did get home, I set up a 4 am alarm and just went straight to dreamland. I woke up at 6 am the next day (I should‚Äôve realized with last2 week‚Äôs incident that alarms don‚Äôt work on me anymore for some reason) and proceeded to procrastinate until I had 2 hours left before the exam starts. And by midafternoon I exited the classroom, saying to myself that I fucked up the exam. Now I‚Äôm close to crying because God damn I wasn‚Äôt like this naman nung highschool pa ako. But now, my time management is so fucked up and my procrastinating habit is over the fucking roof!

Live a life of meticulously budgeted freedom? The dream of retiring early only to spend your golden years tracking every penny and praying the stock market doesn‚Äôt sneeze. Because nothing says ‚Äúfinancial independence‚Äù like the looming anxiety of realizing avocado toast might ruin your monthly projections.

FIRE followers will tell you they‚Äôre living ‚Äúefficiently,‚Äù but it‚Äôs really just glorified penny-pinching. They‚Äôre cutting their own hair, drinking instant coffee, and clipping coupons with a zeal that would make their grandparents proud. They‚Äôll gleefully skip out on social gatherings and vacations because why waste money on ‚Äúexperiences‚Äù when you can sit at home with your DIY furniture and a calculator?

And let‚Äôs be real‚Äî‚Äúretired‚Äù in FIRE just means ‚Äúunemployed with a spreadsheet.‚Äù They‚Äôll claim they‚Äôre free to pursue passion projects, but it‚Äôs usually some side hustle or blog where they detail how they saved $2 on bulk rice. FIRE is a lifestyle dedicated to proving that yes, you can be ‚Äúrich‚Äù in your 30s if you‚Äôre willing to live like a broke college student forever. Because why relax in your retirement when you could be planning your next minimalist meal prep?

And let‚Äôs talk about their version of ‚Äúretirement.‚Äù FIRE folks picture themselves chilling on a beach, but in reality? They‚Äôre sitting in some dimly lit basement, running six side hustles to keep their ‚Äúpassive income‚Äù afloat because their ‚Äú4% rule‚Äù barely covers inflation. Retiring at 35 sounds amazing until you realize you‚Äôll spend the next 50 years arguing with grocery store cashiers over expired coupons and living in perpetual fear of an unexpected dental bill.

This isn‚Äôt financial freedom; it‚Äôs self-imposed poverty with a catchy acronym. It‚Äôs cutting out everything that makes life enjoyable so you can brag on forums about how you ‚Äúescaped the rat race‚Äù by living like a miser. FIRE isn‚Äôt beating the system‚Äîit‚Äôs just a fancy way of quitting life early and calling it ‚Äúretirement.‚Äù

1ge0jpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ge0jpl/how_i_learned_to_take_back_control_when_anxiety/,How I Learned to Take Back Control When Anxiety Took Over,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a little technique that‚Äôs been a lifeline for me when my anxiety feels overwhelming. For a long time, I felt like my mind was constantly racing, replaying worst-case scenarios, and it felt like I had zero control over my own thoughts. There were days when I‚Äôd avoid going out or even answering my phone because of how paralyzing it was.

One day, a friend suggested something called ""grounding"" to help me break free from those spiraling thoughts. At first, I was skeptical it semed too simple to work. But over time, it‚Äôs actually become one of my go-to tools for managing anxiety. Here‚Äôs how I do it:

1. 5 Things I Can See - I look around and focus on five things around me. It can be anything  book, a picture, even a spot on the wall. Naming each one out loud helps pull me out of my head.
2. 4 Things I Can Touch - I find four things to touch. Maybe the fabric of my clothes, a piece of paper, or even the floor. Feeling these textures reminds me of where I am in the present.
3. 3 Things I Can Hear  stop and listen to three distinct sounds around me. It could be birds outside, a car passing by, or even my own breathing.
4. 2 Things I Can Smell - This one can be tricky, but I try to find two scents around me. Sometimes, just a hint of coffee or soap nearby works.
5. 1 Thing I Can Taste - Lastly, I take a sip of water or chew gum‚Äîjust something small to focus on.

This grounding technique has been a huge help for me. It doesn‚Äôt eliminate my anxiety, but it gives me a way to manage it instead of letting it manage me. If you‚Äôre struggling, maybe give it a try and see if it helps. And if anyone has other techniques that work for them, I‚Äôd love to hear about it.

1ge0i5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ge0i5i/gout_in_your_twenties_any_advice/,Gout in your twenties: Any advice?,"Hello,

I am 26 years old (male, 6'5, 190lbs, northern european) and just got diagnosed with gout (last night the pain was almost unbearable in my toe). Any advice for dealing with Gout? I feel kinda ashamed for having gout in my twenties.

I have the feeling for me the cause is my lifestyle over the past 3-6 months. The past few month's I had quite a bit of stress at work (I work in IT, also a lot from home so I sit a lot which is not ideal), so more often than I should I ordered fastfood takeaway (cause no energy to cook), drank more soda, didn't had really great sleep, and had quite a lot of (alcoholic) parties with friends in the weekends.

For me this seems a bit like a wake-up call to do something about my current lifestyle, the plan is to at least until christmas drink zero alcohol, avoid soda and drink only water and coffee or tea, exercise more often and avoid fats, red meat and sea food as much as possible (quite strict diet), and then at least consider christmas as a cheat ""day"".

I am just wondering how life is after the Gout is gone from your toe, how easy will it come back? For example, ideally I want to live a healthier lifestyle in general, but as healthy as I just described (e.g. fully avoiding things) is probably something I can't persevere for ever. For example I also know from myself how much I can enjoy a good night of getting wasted and going out with friends, cooking delicious meals with seafood and/or red meat and a nice glass of wine etc.",1,1730117670.0,AskDocs,7,1.0,False

I wanted to share something that‚Äôs been helping me get through some really dark days. I know how it feels when nothing seems to matter, and even getting out of bed feels like an impossible task. There were days when I thought I'd never feel any different, that maybe this was just how life would be.

One day, I read about a small habit that sounded almost too simple: writing down one thing I‚Äôm grateful for each day. I didn‚Äôt think much of it at first, but I figured I‚Äôd try. On some days, it was just ‚Äúthe coffee I had this morning‚Äù or ‚Äúmy pet keeping me company.‚Äù Other days, I couldn‚Äôt think of anything at all, but I wrote down something small, even if it felt insignificant.

Slowly, I noticed that this tiny habit was shifting my perspective, even if just a little. It didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfix‚Äù everything, but it gave me a reason to look for small bits of light in my day. Over time, this practice became something to hold onto when everything felt overwhelming.

If you‚Äôre going through a rough time, please know that you‚Äôre not alone. I know how it feels to be stuck, but maybe a small habit like this can offer a bit of comfort or a moment of relief. I‚Äôm here if anyone wants to share what‚Äôs been helping them get through, too. Let‚Äôs lift each other up, even on the tough days.

1ge0g2m,https://i.redd.it/cuv6mxkjnhxd1.jpeg,"190 SEK (~$18) pour over at a caf√© ‚Äì ""competition-grade"" beans by Coffea Circulor, natural CM geisha","In Sweden. This is the first pour over I've ever bought at a caf√©, and I'm... whelmed. Not bad at all; actually really good, but I honestly expected more for this price. Supposedly a very good specialty coffee caf√© with talented bartenders, and the owner had competed with this particular coffee.

I feel like the pour over I make at home can either be even better or like 85% of this cup for a fraction of the price and with cheaper specialty beans. The beans I buy normally cost between 200-250 SEK for 250 g, so a 250 ml cup I make is between 13-16 SEK. 

The two differently shaped cups were supposed to enhance different notes from the same coffee. Some minor differences, but my palate might suck. Some nice fruity notes, body and acidity, though, but not the flavor explosion or very noticeable specific fruit notes (yellow plum, etc for this coffee) that I expected from a competition-grade coffee. 

I'm a real sucker for geishas and very processed coffees in general, and I know this is only one kind of coffee, but I don't think competition beans or competition-style brewing will ever be worth it for me ($60-100+ for 100 grams), and I've also realized that I'm actually pretty decent at making pour over on my own. It's fun having tried it, though, but I'll most likely never spend this kind of money on a cup of coffee again.
