1if71sv,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1if71sv/ex_texted_back_after_2_years_m31/,Ex texted back after 2 years [M31),"31 year old guy here and i need some help.

So me and my ex broke up about 2 years ago. We had an relationship for 6 years. So it was pretty long. We did not have anything together like kids or an house. I have some bad memories from the end of the relationship.

I had a rough time then, my father passed away and i was feeling very sad and eventually went in to a depression. Luckily im happy now. 

When i got in a depression she had to take care of me and she did very well. I told her i needed some distance to work/cure myself. We had almost no contact for a month. I told her that i felt better and we came back together.

Time passed and i did love her a lot, but somehow i was having a hard time to give love like before. She noticed and we talked a lot but it did not change. So one day she told me we should break up. I was devestated but if she wanted to i had no choice. 

I did some stupid stuff to win her back, its cringe but it happens when you feel desperate. We eventually spoke and i remeber the exact words she used she was crying and said ""i hope you get well and wish you all the best, but i cannot see you happy and being better then before knowing im not a part of it"" so this was our last conversation 2 years ago.

I got better en worked on myself, went to the gym and now i got a great physique. Have gotten abs, wide shoulders and good arms. Sporting helped me a lot in those times. I finished my masters degree a year ago and i feel very confident. Got a new and better paid job. When i look in the mirror im happy with myself and my life is great.

I went on dates and even had a short relationship for 3 months but it did not work out and we are friends now. 

Last thursday it happened. My ex did sent me a message. 

""Hi i did see you last week when you were shopping. You looked very good. How are you""

I was shocked. It made me warm but also very confused.

I texted back a couple hours later because i was shocked to hear from here.

""Hi im doing fine, how are you""

5 mins went by and i got this.

""Im doing great, thanks. It did me good to see you doing well last week. I can see you changed as a person. I also had some rough times and became a better person. Would love to tell you more and know more about your story. I just want to see you and talk with you. If you want we can go meet eachother at the coffee place where we first met. Let me know if you would like to go on a coffee date :)""

My heart is pounding and i even got that feeling in my stomach since she told me that. But my brain is doubting. I would love to see her again. But im doubting about what to do.

I did not text here back and i also noticed i got unblocked on every platform i was blocked on. She watched my stories and gave me some likes on some pictures.

So what should i text back or what should i do. I feel very confused about what i want to do. I hope this helps me a lot and hopefully i gave enough information to you guys to give me some help.

1if71f3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1if71f3/cuisinart_dgb450_10cup_coffee_maker_with_grinder/,Cuisinart DGB-450 10-Cup Coffee Maker with Grinder review is this worth it?,"I’ve been using the Cuisinart DGB-450 10-Cup Coffee Maker with Grinder for a few months now, and let me tell you, it’s been an interesting journey. As someone who loves the smell of freshly ground coffee wafting through the house in the morning, this machine felt like a dream come true. But, as with all things, the reality is a mix of highs and lows. Here's my take on this automatic grind-and-brew coffee maker.

**Design & Build Quality**

The first thing that struck me when I unboxed the Cuisinart DGB-450 was its sleek black and stainless-steel finish. It’s modern, stylish, and fits well in almost any kitchen aesthetic. The machine is fairly compact, although it does take up a bit of counter space, which might be a concern for those with smaller kitchens. Its thermal carafe is a standout feature, keeping coffee warm for hours without the need for a warming plate—a huge plus for energy efficiency.

However, I found the design of the water reservoir a bit tricky. Pouring water into the chamber can get messy, especially in tight spaces, as the carafe lacks clear measurements for smaller quantities. The machine is durable, but cleaning certain parts, like the grinder chute, can feel like a chore.

**Brewing Performance**

The brewing process is impressively fast. The grinder does its job well, grinding beans to a fine consistency before brewing. I appreciated the programmability of the machine—it’s a lifesaver on groggy mornings. Setting it up the night before and waking up to freshly brewed coffee is a luxury I don’t take for granted anymore.

Despite its efficiency, the grinder is loud. It’s not a dealbreaker for me, but if you have light sleepers in the house, consider this your warning. Another minor issue is the coffee grounds sometimes getting stuck in the chute, which requires regular cleaning to avoid clogs.

**Coffee Flavor**

This machine delivers on taste. The freshly ground beans produce a richer, more robust cup of coffee compared to pre-ground alternatives. The thermal carafe ensures the coffee remains hot while preserving the flavor, even after a couple of hours. While the coffee itself is smooth and aromatic, the machine doesn’t allow for temperature adjustments, which might be a downside for those who prefer piping hot coffee.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**

Cleaning the Cuisinart DGB-450 is where things get a bit tricky. The grinder and chute need to be cleaned after every use, as moisture from brewing can make the grounds sticky. It’s not a quick rinse-and-go situation—you’ll need to dedicate some time to disassemble and clean the components. On top of that, the machine requires regular descaling, so keep some white vinegar handy for when the “clean” light inevitably comes on.

**Pros**

* Sleek design with a thermal carafe that keeps coffee hot for hours.
* Programmable settings make mornings more convenient.
* Produces flavorful coffee with freshly ground beans.
* Durable build quality that feels like it will last for years.

**Cons**

* Grinder is noisy and requires cleaning after every use.
* Water reservoir design could be more user-friendly.
* Lacks a temperature adjustment option.
* Grounds sometimes get stuck in the chute, adding to maintenance.

**Comparison to Competitors**

I’ve used other coffee makers with built-in grinders, like Breville’s Grind Control and De’Longhi’s Dinamica series. While the Breville offers more customization options (like grind size and brew strength), it comes with a heftier price tag. The De’Longhi machines are more automated and offer a sleeker user experience but are considerably more expensive as well.

In comparison, the Cuisinart DGB-450 strikes a balance between affordability and functionality. It offers the perks of freshly ground coffee without overcomplicating the process. However, its maintenance requirements are higher than both competitors, which might be a dealbreaker depending on your tolerance for cleaning chores.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

This coffee maker sits in the mid-range category for grind-and-brew machines. For its price, it offers a good mix of features like programmability, a thermal carafe, and a built-in grinder. However, the effort required to maintain it might make some question whether it’s worth the investment. If you’re someone who values a freshly brewed cup and doesn’t mind the cleaning routine, this machine is a solid choice. For those who want a more hands-off experience, it might be worth looking into higher-end alternatives.

**Features and Settings**

The Cuisinart DGB-450 comes with a programmable timer, allowing you to set your brew time up to 24 hours in advance. The built-in grinder is efficient, though it lacks grind size adjustments. You can also turn the grinder off if you prefer to use pre-ground coffee, which adds versatility. The thermal carafe is double-walled and stainless steel, keeping coffee hot for hours without affecting the taste. Additionally, the reusable filter minimizes waste, though you can opt for paper filters if that’s your preference.

First off, enlist your friends and neighbors as the unofficial ""Organizing Ambassadors."" You know, those wonderful folks who can’t stop mentioning the time they finally found their kitchen counters? They’ll get the word out faster than a gossip session at a coffee shop.

Start with a simple “Discovery Day.” Invite your nearest and dearest over for a little open house where you can showcase your organizing magic. Set up stations showcasing your services—think closet transformations, home offices made tidy, and maybe even a before-and-after slideshow that captures the awe. And don't forget the snacks! Cookies always help seal the deal.

As for pricing, let’s make it tiered—like a buffet but with organization rather than endless mashed potatoes. Here’s a basic outline for your service levels:

1. **Basic Tidy Package** - We’re talking quick and snappy—a two-hour session where you help declutter a space. This is perfect for those overwhelmed by a single drawer that looks like it was attacked by a raccoon. 

2. **Declutter Duo Package** - This is where things get juicy! A longer session to tackle a room of choice. You come in armed with bins and labels, teaching your client how to cultivate a more peaceful living space while you've got the tunes bumping in the background. 

3. **The Full Monty Package** - For those ready to go all-in, this is a comprehensive revamp of the entire home. You provide ongoing support with follow-up sessions, life coaching on maintaining the organized space, and maybe a sprinkle of inspirational quotes—think “Your home is a reflection of your soul, and right now, it’s looking a bit... cluttered.”

Now, it’s all about strategies—social media is your friend here, so create a vibrant Instagram account showcasing your before-and-after success stories. Get testimonials from those friends and neighbors who have had the privilege of receiving your organizing prowess. 

Lastly, leverage the community angle. Host workshops or offer free sessions at local community centers. Remember, it’s not just about organizing spaces; it’s about creating communities where people feel supported and encouraged to take on their clutter battles together.

As you embark on this journey, keep your humor and heart front and center. After all, transforming someone’s messy closet isn’t just about removing junk; it’s about freeing up mental space and welcoming in peace and clarity!",1,1738418474.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

Typically, I spend my layovers walking around Bellevue Square, searching for a new coffee shop or at the gym. Currently looking for soup dumplings anywhere besides Din Tai Fung. I do occasionally head to downtown for my favorite oysters at Elliott’s. My guilty tourist pleasure is the fish throwing at Pike’s place and the little chaotic bookstore on the bottom floor.

Give me any excuse to pack something i can dress up and show off in. Social drinker who will always order a glass of Chianti or Negroamaro if it’s on the menu. I can appreciate a good old fashioned or Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban neat. My love language is physical touch, and ordering one of everything on the menu. My spirit animal is Jar Jar Binks.

Usually it’s images and reviews and distance considerations. Not today. Today I just wanted to—needed, to be away from familiar space.

I dreamed of you again. It’s almost as if I had a momentary affliction that dissipated with the images as they disintegrated into the thin plane of reality as I opened my eyes. I woke holding my chest. Not in pain, or anxious searching. I held it with appreciation for harmony with you. Warmth, and gladness overcame me as my eyelids reached upward and my lashes tickled my brow, a smile paying homage to what dreams I am now able to dream.  Because of you. 

I am not expectant. I am not delusional. I have no needs you can accomplish for me. Neither do I have unhealthy attachment. I am not suspected of being untrustworthy, neither have I don’t anything against my own values or yours. It’s quite simple: I miss you. I admire you. And my dream, honored that. 

I still replay the last conversation I had with you. I rehearse different responses, say things differently. Perhaps it’s my way of ensuring that this—friendless and futureless—doesn’t occur again. Perhaps, I should not have said anything, but I’m not sure it would change anything. I’d still be gone. You would still be a felt absence. She’d likely still pity me. I despise her pity, if I’m honest. Not her, she’s great. But her pity—arrogant and misplaced, I despise. She’s always had it. And I’ve always found it grating. But in this case, it was damaging. 

Either way, you are a familiar place I wish I could return to. And all spaces associated with you. I can’t.  So, I’m instead sipping coffee in a new place, wholly being.

There is also a little girl who waits downstairs at my hotel every day, playing on her phone while hoping someone will buy her balloons. Unfortunately, I don鈥檛 need a balloon, and I worry that if I buy from them, their families might see it as encouragement for them to work instead of going to school and getting an education.

How should I understand this situation? When I was a child, if I had the chance to go out and earn money during holidays, it would have been a good way to gain experience and develop social skills. In that sense, supporting children by buying from them could be a positive thing.

However, the girl selling balloons has been there from 9 AM to 9 PM every day. That makes me feel a bit sad.

1if6qko,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1if6qko/3_months_boundaries_and_not_understanding_anything/,"3 months, boundaries, and not understanding anything.","Me 30M and my ex 26F broke up 3 months ago. Week after the break up I left the country for two months. During that time i proposed not to speak any more and she broke no contact after 10 days. Since then we spoke every week or two about how we both felt and how was life going. 

One month ago i came back and started my life again in the same city but this time alone. We saw each other and spoke about what we both wanted. Myself I still love her and I set my boundaries. She instead said that she loves me but she can’t be in a relationship until she figures out how to be ok on her own. She is too codependent and in some way this hurts her and any relationship she could have. 

Since our first initial chat since I came back I have seen her more just to figure things out about our old apartment. I was gonna move into the apartment and she would leave because she couldn’t keep paying it on her own. So we had to see each other to change bills names and other unimportant stuff. But she always wanted to go out for coffee afterwards and keep hanging and chatting. 

About two weeks ago we started seeing each other more. Because of a friend in common. And with this we also start hanging out by ourselves. Called me to go for a walk, to have some coffee before work even watching a movie at her place. Nothing ever happened out of this. But once she gave me a jealousy treat about me going out and assuming that I was moving on with my life. 

For the last three days she had been moving her stuff out of the apartment so I helped her move out as well as she helped me to move in. I had seen some positive things from her part like calling me with our inside relationship nickname, looking for contact instead of just receiving it (hugs, holding hands, kisses in the cheeks). We spoke about our relationship and how she sees that her expectations around men are too high near impossible for someone to achieve and that I was 80% of all that she needs. But it’s still missing that 20% and that she knows that no one will ever be the perfect person for her. I said the same to her, that she was not my idolized partner. But was close enough and that’s why I wanted to be with her. And that that isn’t conforming or just set the bar lower. It’s the reality of the world. 

Last night after moving everything I told her what I really thought about her. That she has the potential to be the best woman ever but until then she will continue to do the same things. And that that’s why I wouldn’t (even if I really want to) get back with her. This kind of hurt her but is the truth. After that we went out to drink a couple of beers and she started to trying to make plans for us to go to a techno festival this summer. 

I had been honest about my feelings, about me and her. I set my boundaries saying we were not friends we are exes. She gave me her piece of mind about our old relationship. Jealousy, feelings hurt. And with all this she wants to keep hanging chatting or even make plans. 

I guess I’m just venting, or maybe I’m looking for answers for something that not even have an answer from strangers in the internet. But this is my story and my life at this point. I’m not even sad or worried. I would just like to understand her. To see if I could help her out.

He quickly apologizes and offers to pay for my coffee. I laugh it off and say it’s fine, but he insists. “No, really, let me,” he says, already tapping his card. Alright then, free coffee for me.

We make some small talk while waiting and tells about where he stays, asks about where am i staying and my plan for the rest of the trip and he checks his phone before saying “My Uber’s here,” sounding a little annoyed.

I glance outside, expecting a normal car… but instead, there’s a black Cadillac Escalade with a driver in a suit holding the door open.

He sees my expression and just shrugs. “It was the cheapest option.” Then he grabs his coffee, thanks me for the chat, and gets in like this is totally normal.

I guess every lounge is disappointing after experiencing the one at Moynihan, but Boston's is easily the worst of those along the NEC.

We spend every weekend together in either his or my house, have been on a couple of holidays etc. 

His son moved out 15 months ago, and now lives with his girlfriend. They plan on getting married this November. 

I met the son a few times, incl for Christmas dinner, his birthday, M's birthday and a fair few times when M's son and girlfriend came over. 

All meetings have been uneventful. I gave him birthday and Christmas presents (cash; tools he really wanted) and always made an effort to chat to him about his pets, car etc. 

2 weeks ago, out of the blue, the son sent M a flyer for his low key engagement party, without any personal note or comment. Both M and I assumed I was invited. 

M tried to catch up with his son all week, but never got hold of him. Today, the son finally answered the phone. With the party just 6 days away, the son said it would be best if I don't come, as his mum (M's Ex) will be there and she and I haven't yet met.

By the way of background, M's wife left him 4 years back. They were both deeply unhappy. She called it off, thinking she could do better. To her surprise, dating didn't work out for her and she is still single, many of their joint friends picked Team M, and there is more housework than she thought (this is the summary according to their adult kids). She also never thought that M would ever find anyone. She isn't thrilled that she's single and he isn't.

I am really ruffled. I think it's pretty rude of the son to not even say upfront that I am not invited when I sent the flyer.
It's feels very inconsiderate to not let his dad bring his partner?
And - if he was so worried about the mum meeting me, he could have either organized a lower key meeting himself. 
Or he could have let us know earlier. I sure could have met her over a coffee with a bit more heads up. 

So.... How to navigate this? 
I feel a bit hurt and overlooked. 

And - there is the wedding around the corner. Any tips about that?

EDIT 
I am not expecting my partner not to go.

It was our third date, I had asked Sam to pick the spot, and she jumped for Brandt’s. So, come November 7th, we meet at Brandt’s. I’m not much of a coffee drinker, really; maybe as a treat once or twice a year.

“Can I be honest with you, Sam?” I looked up after taking my first few sips of the coffee. Spying Sam’s soft hazel eyes; her blonde, curly hair formed a mane that framed her round face. She was beautiful, to the point where I found myself glancing up at her every few moments, just to remind me about how lucky I am.

“Yeah? Don’t like it?” Sam’s face was knowing, I must’ve made a face or something.

“It’s thick! It tastes and feels like watered-down honey! Coffee doesn’t do that, Sam,” I leaned in conspiratorially, “are you trying to *poison* me, Sam?” I feel as my face contorts into an exaggerated visage of fear.

Sam giggled, “Well, Mr. Picky, if you hate it so much don’t drink it. I’m sorry your palette has been ruined by Shitbucks,” she smugly started sipping her coffee. Her laugh had made my insides melt, then re-solidify. It felt as if I had crystals in my kidneys as I tried to maintain a semblance of homeostasis in her presence.

“I know I’ve told you this, but your laugh is amazing. There’s something about it that I can’t place, it just feels…” a pause, someone had loudly opened the coffee shop’s door, allowing the freezing cold to bleed in. Despite being in a sweater, I felt my blood freeze.

Before I could regain my thoughts, Sam spoke, “Hey, I finished my coffee, we should head out! Wanna come hang at my place?”

\---

Sam and I were dancing together. It had been a year, or a few, and now we lived together in an apartment. It was November 7th, and we had just unpacked the massive amount of three boxes. We celebrate with wine (apple juice for me, not much into alcohol) and a bit of music.

“What song is this, Sam?” We did our best to slow-dance, but we both had no idea what we were doing. Still, I was happy, I had Sam holding me, and I holding her. Her head rested on my shoulder, her hair was straight and brown now, she must’ve changed it recently. I inhaled the smell of her shampoo, it reminded me of wet park dew in the morning.

“I have no clue, Spotify must be shuffling weird shit into our playlists,” Sam said, with an oddly aggressive tone. The song *was* weird, but not horrid. It had a steady tone in the background: *beep, beep, beep.* The lyrics were near-imperceptible, like a man was speaking far away. Otherwise, the song was impenetrable, no beat nor rhythm can be discerned. I found it disgustingly artistic.

“I don’t know, it’s kinda…” I stopped speaking, the window was open. *Who opened that? Why is it so bright out?* A cold breeze flew in, as if on queue. I held Sam closer, trying to share body warmth as the flood of cold hit me.

Sam closed the window, “I must’ve left it open, my bad,” Sam walked back over to me, wrapping her arms around my neck, “Now, we should probably set up that bed, unless you wanna be sleeping on the floor.”

\---

Sam and I sat in a laundry room, *our* laundry room. A decade or such has passed, and Sam and I finally scrounged the cash to get a home. Unlike our younger selves, we had unpacked as quickly as possible; no dancing or alcohol for these responsible adults on the night of November 7th. We were tired, and decided to get some clothes in the wash. We realized something had made them smell unpleasant while we unpacked, like puke.

Sam’s short black hair was soft as I ran my fingers through it, her arms were wrapped around me, an odd position indeed. I stared into her cutting blue eyes, getting lost in the ocean of her irises, nearly sinking in the whirlpool of her pupils.

“I still don’t know what could’ve made our clothes smell like that! Something must’ve died or something,” I postured aloud, not really caring about the inconvenience, but simply making conversation.

“It’s nothing, I don’t know why you’re so worried about it,” Sam replied curtly.

The look I gave her must’ve been powerfully sorrowful, her eyes widened quickly, and she stammered a response.

“H-hey! Sorry about that, didn’t mean for that to come out like… that,”

“Are you okay, Sam? You seem a bit tense,” I ran a caring hand across her cheek, attempting to soothe her.

“I-I’m fine,” she glanced around, ignoring my caress, searching for something I never could discern.

“Alright, you’ve just been acting a bit…” I was interrupted as the air conditioning kicked on, loudly proclaiming its life. Cold air flooded the room, much colder than any AC has the right to be. My body started to tremble uncontrollably.

We were in the kitchen, Sam and I probably left the cold laundry room, “Come on, let’s eat some dinner before it gets late.”

\---

Sam and I were arguing in the living room. It’s been a while, we’ve found a new home. A vase shattered a few feet from my head. Sam’s beautiful face, topped with short, curly blonde hair, had mutated into a hateful mask.

“GET OUT! You need to leave!” Sam was screaming, her green eyes stabbing daggers into my heart, “This isn’t right! We shouldn’t be here!”

I was perplexed, what had I done wrong? “Sam, what are you talking about?”

“You haven’t noticed? Of course you fucking haven’t,” Sam shook her head vigorously, as if trying to release someone’s grip from her face.

“Sam, please, tell me what’s wrong.”

“What day is it?”

“What? Sam-”

“What. Fucking. Day. Is. IT!?”

“November 7th… why does that matter?” my mind dug deep into itself, searching for a meaning.

Sam looked around, searching for nothing, nothing at all. Then she found nothing. She strode to our front door. “Now you’ll see!” Sam threw open our front door.

Blinding white, what was a simple suburb has morphed into an impossibly white landscape. Thousands of sensations flooded in from that door. The first was the taste, a saline taste infected my throat, hiding under it a sweet tang of…

Then the voices came, they were distant, but they were accompanied with a steady *beep, beep, beep*…

Finally, the freezing wind grabbed my ankles, I started to shake, my body convulsing as I was pulled to the ground. I gripped the banister of the stairs, gripping them for dear life.

“Sam, please! Close the door!”

Sam’s face had changed, it was now a cavernous maw of regret and sadness, “I can’t, you need to wake up one day, you can’t keep living like this.”

“No! I want to be here! I want to be with you.”

“You had dreams! You had plans! You can’t throw them away.” I felt as my grip was weakening, the voices were growing louder, the taste was causing me to retch. My temples were being crushed by cinder blocks, the sky was screaming.

“P-please! I don’t care about them! It *hurts* out there! There isn’t anything there for me.”

“Family? Friends? You’re lying to yourself.”

“I’d throw it all away to stay here.” One hand lost grip, I was desperate, I felt my nails dig deep into the wood. The wood bowed, threatening to shatter in my grip. Objects scattered around our house started to fly past me into the white void.

Sam’s eyes softened to a hazel, “Are you being honest? You would give that all up for… this?”

My mouth was filled with bile, I couldn’t speak. So I nodded vigorously.

With a sigh, Sam effortlessly closed the door. The windows displayed our neighbor’s homes again; a red car passed.

The tastes, the noises, the feelings: they were all gone. I stood up and ran to Sam, gripping her tightly. “Never again, please. Never, ever, ever, ever…” Tears formed in my eyes, I held her as tightly as I could. My head wouldn’t stop shaking, denying the truths I never saw.

Sam wrapped her arms around me, “Never again, we’ll stay here, forever.”

And I stayed dreaming.

\---

“It’s been two weeks, why isn’t he awake yet?” Bob looked down at his comatose friend, “you said it would be a week, at most.” The heart rate monitor steadily beeped, the nurse had just cleaned out his neck IV with some saline, and hurried away.

The doctor bit his knuckle, trying to think of a good excuse, “He drank a lot of the Glycol, we can’t exactly tell what will happen. Only guess.”

“You’re saying he might be like this forever?” Reba stood up, she had been in the room all day, waiting for her nephew to finally wake up. This had become her recent daily job, sitting there, silently waiting for those eyes to flit open.

“We’re saying we don’t know, Mrs. Bach, the dialysis got rid of most of the Glycol in his blood, but with how long he was out there in the park, we can’t tell how he is mentally.”

Reba sat back down, tears starting to form in her eyes. Bob already had a stream forming on his cheeks.

“We’ve tried to wake him up, we tried some drugs, we’re looking into bringing some neurostimulants. It’s like he’s resisting the call to wake up.”

Reba sobbed, Bob grabbed his friend's hand, feeling the deathly chill of it.

And he stayed dreaming.",1,1738416810.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

To preface, I am a 48F, 5’ 7” 233 lbs. My history: I have struggled with my weight since early childhood. I was always bigger and heavier than all my friends. I lost 60lbs for the first time when I was 16. I basically starved myself. I regained and lost the same 60lbs many times throughout my life. Naturally thin people don’t realize how difficult it is to lose massive amounts of weight. I feel that anyone who has lost a significant amount of weight deserves a trophy because it takes so much will power, work, and determination. Fat people aren’t lazy or gluttons. Our brains are wired for survival. In fact, I have always eaten healthy and I am active and go to the gym and walk on breaks at work. People are shocked at how fast I am at my size. I do so many of the “right” things and I still can’t keep the weight off.

I feel ok this morning. I’m a little queasy and tired but nothing extreme. I had some water and a small cup of coffee but don’t feel like eating. It’s refreshing to not worry about eating the minute I wake up. If Wegovy takes the burden of needing to use my willpower to turn my brain off and not think about food I think things will be so much easier for me. 

Thank you for reading. I am excited to have started this journey.

1if6dnh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AceAttorney/comments/1if6dnh/retrospective_on_tt_after_second_playthrough_the/,Retrospective on T&T after second playthrough : The relationship between Iris and the cast.,"Long analysis post incoming.

I remember that the first time I played T&T , I found Iris Hawthorne/Fey to be quite blank as a character. Loveable sure cause she's kindness incarnated , but by herself being quite useless in the sense she always is used by others and is quite passive. We never really get to see what she likes in life (well except one spiky haired loveable as well Ace Attorney) , what she dreams of or what she herself wants to achieve. In that extent me , as a player , always thought of her as someone 100% in Stockholm syndrome for Dahlia who just escaped her hand cause she fell in love with Phoenix and that's it. 
But huh , replaying the game with all clues in hand made me felt different about her. Her importance in the story isn't her own person but how that aspect of her is a catalyst for others. And i'm gonna prove it. 

**First part : Iris vs Edgeworth : trusting Wright**

So... Edgeworth took over the case for Phoenix. Did he wants to ? Not really. Did he figured Iris was innocent ? Not really... as well he even asked her lot of time about her being the murderer or not in slightly different ways to ensure he would not see any psyche locks : Edgeworth don't really believe in these in the first place especially since he hold a disbelief about channeling since DL-6 but , still did cause Phoenix himself was 100% sure Iris wasn't guilty and Phoenix gave him the Magatama to ensure it. He went against his own belief just cause he trusted Wright and Iris kinda caught that instantly. She felt Edgeworth was very different but that if Wright trusted him she could too. And that's a mirror there. Both trust each other cause they feel Wright trust the other part as much. There's even the fact Edgeworth forces her to confess to Phoenix as a condition to defend her. Edgeworth knows by now... what matters to Phoenix is the truth and so does he. 

**Second Part : Iris vs Godot :sharing the guilt**

There comes the big reveal : Iris helped Godot hides the crime. This raised 2 questions : First , why Iris would go against her sister she was so protective with the whole time ? Second , why Godot would even trust a Dahlia lookalike despite he's so blinded by guilt that he pulls all of the blame on Phoenix for nothing and overwise why would he notice as a worthy accomplice the women who covered everything for Dahlia despite he hates her with all his guts ? 

The first is given by Iris herself : she despise channeling. And that's the PIVOT of Iris as a character : the only thing she wants is forgiveness she's unsure she can get. And looking at this that's way you can get where i'm getting at : what is done is done , and you can't undo it. THAT'S THE EXACT THING GODOT IS HIMSELF CLAIMING. And he's exactly like her in that regard. Godot deep inside wants Mia to forgive himself not being there to save her , the same Iris wants Phoenix to forgive him not being there to stop Dahlia. Both feel they failed to protect the very being they loved.

**Part 3 :  Godot ""I'm Diego Armando""**

Yeah he is... and he reveals it in the court but then  share the ""best darkness"" of his life with Phoenix Wright (spelled right for once). When did he do it ? When Phoenix learnt for sure that he indeed dated someone who really loved him. Cause they are both on the same boat right now cause of the same evil being : Dahlia Hawthorne. Why ? Cause that coffee tasted like the truth. Both had a trauma cause of the same evil but both solved the riddle at the same time. And Iris and Godot share the same weakness : fear to talk to Wright. But that's all solved. 

**Part 4 : Iris vs Phoenix , birth of the Ace Attorney""**

And there's i'll just stop on one pure genuine evidence : the hood. For whole of the episode we are confused : is she Dahlia ? Is she playing with us ? Why did she gifted us that hood.
It's all clear after the case if we dare to remember (incapable of first time). She gave it this to write the whole story again. Phoenix met Dahlia in the courtroom **on first sight** but her motive was to hide something. Iris took up for dating but she felt in love with ""feenie"". But what was the first thing Feenie reminded or their love ? Dahlia giving her one of her belongings. Iris recreated the same by giving her the hood. She genuinely wanted to rewrite the past and give Phoenix a personnal present on first sight to correct the lie and make her being the real Dahlia who gifted something to Phoenix the first time she encounted her as Sister Iris ,  as her sister did. She just wanted to rewind and do things right. And Phoenix knew...remember the first trial. Phoenix claimed the Dahlia on the stand must be a fake. We all figured he was on a simp denial but no... he was right. The Dahlia he met in the stand never was the Dahlia he loved. He only knew Iris and was already about to see the truth about people. He just could've imagine a twin. ",1,1738416774.0,AceAttorney,0,1.0,False

I was laying in bed and felt 2 bugs crawling on my neck. I reached to squish them and felt liquid. I got up and turned the light on. There was blood on my hand and about 8 bed bugs on my pillow and a drape that touched the bed. I squished them all bare handed out of panic. This was at 3 am after 4 consecutive 11 hour shifts at work with little sleep. I was awake because I was surviving on energy drinks. I got lucky. I found out that I don't react to the bites. I wouldn't have known they were there for quite awhile.

I immediately took action. Don't wait. Identify them and then murder them. I stayed awake. I slept about 12 hours total in the 3 nights prior and had no sleep when I found them. I started killing them off adrenaline.

I worked in a hotel for awhile years ago and when there were suspected bed bugs we used a small heater to heat the room. I went into action and turned the heat in my house up to 90f. Then I put an electric heater with no shut off sensor for temperature control in my bedroom. The house became ridiculously hot. The bedroom felt like a sauna. I was sweating after being in the room for just seconds. 
While the room was heating up, I put all of my clothes in the dryer. It took about 5 dryer cycles before everything including the bed linens and pillows were heat cleaned. Then I put everything in bags and directly to my garage which is separate from my house. After about 4 hours of heat, I noticed bed bugs slowly coming out of the wall above my bed where a curtain rod was connected to a piece of wood that was painted. I sprayed the bugs with pure bleach until the entire area was soaked. They all died. As the bleach dripped behind the wooden block, a brown liquid started dripping. I found a harborage. The heat was working. The problem with the heat though was that it gave me a false sense of confidence. Heat rises and while the area that they were hiding reached a fatal temperature, some escaped and others were already in other rooms. I found 2 in my front room the next day.

I called my landlord in the morning and he told me that he would come in 4 days to spray pesticide. I let the heat continue until around midnight and then having been awake for over 40 hours, I turned the heater off and slept on the couch downstairs. This was a bad idea, they spread in 1 day. They scattered from the heat and found me but I didn't know because I wasn't reacting to the bites.

Day 4/First pesticide treatment:
My landlord came and sprayed something without telling me what it was and left. He sprayed the baseboards of the front room and bedroom. The bottom and back of my couch, chairs, and bed. He also sprayed along the edge of the basement ceiling. I am living in a 4 bedroom house but I lost a roommate and 3 rooms are basically empty so he skipped them. I felt like he didn't use enough spray but I was broke and he was helping for free so I didn't question anything. He said the poison has a 30 day residual. I saw no bed bugs until day 13.

Day 13/The bed bugs reappear

When I say reappear, I mean to my view. They were there the entire time feeding on me. I just wasn't aware. I was alternating sleeping between the bed and the couch because I wanted to draw as many to the poison as possible and because sleeping in the bed was creeping me out. This was also a mistake but initially I was in shock and I have PTSD from a past event that put me in flight mode. I was feeling like the poison killed the stragglers from the heat. I decided to have a good night and relax. I was listening to music around 6pm and playing with my dog when 3 adult bed bugs coordinated an attack on us. They ran up 2 separate chairs, 1 on 1 and 2 on the other, simultaneously while I was awake with a light on and blasting metal. They weren't scared at all. This told me they were still there and also recklessly hungry. It also put my PTSD into fight mode. PTSD has become my superpower.

I immediately took action. I spent the next 16 hours boiling water and pouring it on everything. The furniture, the carpet, the baseboards, the drapes, the wood floor in my bedroom, everything. There was so much humidity that water was freezing on my windows. I boiled so much water that the inside of my pots turned white. Then I cranked up the heat to slowly dry everything. I waited another 5 hours until the couch was mostly dry and then went to sleep on it. I again felt confident that they were gone. I was wrong. I called my landlord again the next morning and told him that they came back. He told me he would spray again week 4 because the residual was still working.

Day 19/
I cleaned my floor with a vacuum and wet floor cleaner vacuum in preparation for treating on pay day. I turned the heat on to let it dry. I also turned the heat high in hope that eggs would hatch. Nymphs are easier to kill.

Day 20/Payday & more poison

On day 20 I got paid. There was also a cold snap and it was -30 degrees outside with the wind chill. I realized that if I put items in my cold garage it would kill the bugs, literally everything besides the furniture, a coffee table, some vinyl records that I didn't want to get destroyed (placed in a closet in an unused room), the bed, and a wooden coat rack went in the garage. I found an adult bed bug on the coat rack. I sprayed it with bleach and elevated it on an upside down plastic bin that was sprayed with Deet. Up until this point, I was completely broke. I paid rent and bills and had around $50 left over. I had canned goods for food that were just sitting in my cupboard. I didn't have much of an appetite since I found the bugs. I decided to use the money to murder bugs instead of buying food. Bed bugs will leave you broke and exhausted. I was researching poison over the entire 20 days. I couldn't afford Crossfire but I found a reddit post about Raid Foaming Bed Bug Killer. It has the same ingredients as Crossfire and the same residual. I purchased 3 cans from Walmart and sprayed the baseboards and around the ceiling in every room. I sprayed around the window frames. I sprayed the couch, chairs, and bed. Then I did probably the smartest thing that I have done so far, I sprayed a shape of a box of poison around the entry to every room and in boxes in areas in the hallways up the walls over the ceiling and back down over the floor until the spray connected. This made barriers that could not be passed without traveling through the wall. If the bugs traveled through the wall, they would eventually have to climb over the poisoned baseboards. I had some spray left so I sprayed all of the electrical outlets and my shoes. I had some red solo cups and pulled out an old futon from storage. It had metal legs. My couch didn't. My couch had slats under it that sat directly on the carpet. I put the futon in the room where my couch was and dragged the couch to the garage. I put the solo cups under the legs of the futon and under the legs of the coffee table. They didn't fit the legs of the chair but the chair is saturated in poison. If you use solo cups put water in them so you know if they crack. 1 already cracked from my weight. I created a space on the futon where I could avoid bites and I only go on it directly after a shower with clean clothes. When I sprayed my bed, it had a harborage of nymphs on the side of it. I sprayed them and I think these were eggs that recently hatched and only fed once or twice. I stayed in the room for awhile after spraying and was vaping. The CO2 from the vape or the effects of the spray seemed to be driving tiny bed bugs out of cracks in the wall. After all of this and not eating, I showered and fell asleep on the futon.

Day 22/
I have only seen a couple small nymphs. They seem to be hanging out on the wall in my bedroom and bathroom. They are very tiny. I dragged my couch to the garage because I found sticky spots on it and this is a sign of eggs. It is still very cold and supposed to be sustained under 0f for multiple days. I'm planning on leaving everything in the garage until summer.

My next plan is to purchase actual Crossfire and Cimexa when I receive my tax check at the end of the month. I cannot even afford food right now so I have no choice but to wait. I lost my job because of the bugs. The company didn't want me to bring them to work so they let me go. I'm also going to let my landlord follow up with his second spray on day 30.

I will continue to update this post. I spent days reading these posts and it helped my anxiety. I decided to document my fight in hopes of helping someone else in the future. I hope some of these methods or methods from my future posts help. I also hope that it helps to know that you are not alone.",2,1738416343.0,Bedbugs,3,1.0,False

Anybody in this business shed light on this for me?","I have chronic health issues so I was in a wheelchair and being pushed around by a wonderful person who had a few things to attend to, so I was left alone in various places and had plenty of time to look around. I counted over half dozen different kiosks and all but one were selling cell phone covers. 

Isn't it expensive to rent kiosks in places like Metrotown mall? 

I mean I am sure it can't be cheap for the huge stores either, and there are many of them that seemed to be nearly empty. What do they pay the mall per month? And their many salespeople who just stand around doing nothing, waiting for customers? And we had gone there at a time where the mall was quite packed, like big lineups for fast food places and coffee shops and all that. So are they instead making a killing on the few items that they do sell, to just break even?

Can do someone the math for me? What is it these people doing right to be making money given what seems like a huge investment",7,1738416328.0,britishcolumbia,4,0.82,False
1if68es,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1if68es/strong_noise_in_the_colon_and_thin_stools/,"Strong noise in the colon, and thin stools","Hi,

I'm trying to make changes in my daily routine and to understand how my body works in order to get rid of my SIBO (I know I have it, but I'm not sure about the type. Based on the symptoms, it seems to be a mix of methane SIBO and H2S).

I think one of my underlying problems is constipation. Even though I go to the bathroom every day, or even multiple times a day, I always have an incomplete feeling, and my transit time is really long.

I already have antimicrobial treatment in place with a practitioner, but it's taking a long time, and I feel like it's not effective if I don’t address the root cause. I started taking ginger and artichoke extracts in the morning, followed by a coffee about 30 minutes before lunch. I now space my meals 3–4 hours apart, I'm working on my vagus nerve, and I stay well-hydrated. I think I’ve seen some improvement, especially with the consistency of my stools, which are much more normal now, although I still struggle with having regular bowel movements. But I feel like things are getting better.

The problem is that, despite this, sometimes, out of nowhere, everything goes wrong. After a week of daily, well-formed BM, yesterday I went a little later than usual, but it was still well-formed, and I was satisfied. Around midnight, my stomach started to make a lot of noise, specifically near my sigmoid colon and rectum. A little gas was expelled, but most of it stayed inside, and the noises were really loud. In the morning, the noises continued. The first stool I did was softer than usual. After it, there was still a lot of noise, everywhere in the colon. Then I had to go back to the bathroom twice, and now I only have very thin stools, still with that incomplete evacuation feeling.

What do you think of all this? I really don't understand how this works.  
  
Why this much noise ? And why the suddenly thin stools ?   
  
Is it related ?

Thank you so much for taking your time to read it, any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.",1,1738416283.0,SIBO,0,1.0,False

We had this question asked over coffee with my co-workers. Magkakaiba ang sagot naming lahat but their response to mine was something I had to ponder for a while.

I told them I am not afraid to be gone. Takot lang ako sa process of death but I do not fear leaving this world. I feel like it’s even better when the universe snatches me away from life because maybe then my family would learn something. Maybe then they’ll try to do something about themselves for the better kasi wala din namang use yung constant na paga-ask ko sa kanila to be better. 

Then they told me, “Pano kung hindi naman kailangan na mawala ka? Kailangan lang mawala ka sa kanila pero hindi kailangang mawala ka sa mundo.”

I thought about it for almost a day. Tama nga, ‘no? We can actually try to remove ourselves from situations that do us nothing good. There is that option. Although it is just hard but nobody said it is impossible.

Kaya kung sino man ang gustong mawala dyan, I hope we all find the courage to leave—but only the hopeless situations we’re at, not this world, not life. 🙏🏻",13,1738416180.0,CasualPH,15,1.0,False

Also i'm sorry for any grammar mistakes because english is not my first language

Two months ago i turned 30 and i wasn't happy at all, 
In fact i was in deep psychological dysphoria because i started to think my so far life.
I feel like i wasted my twenties (twenties are very important years for people to become more mature, have experiences and learn skills) 

I am autistic with adhd and i believe because of these two conditions i developed dysthymia, cptsd and social anxiety since i was still a child (not officially diagnosed but i relate to most symptoms of these conditions).
My five conditions went untreated

I tried to ""fix"" my social anxiety with the most easy to find drug ""alcohol"" and that wasn't the best idea because it led me to have alcohol problem

Since i was 16 and mostly at my 20 and later i was drinking alcohol so i could be comfortable with people and loud environments

I love this kind of numbness/euphoria alcohol gives me
I am more relaxed, comfortable, energized and social
I can being touched or listening to loud sudden noises without me jumping and startling in fear

My parents are good people, i know they love me, i still live with them, but that doesn't mean they weren't traumatized me.
I guess they didn't know other way to raise me as a child and teenager other than being physically and mentally abusive when i was naughty or didn't listening to them and when they caughted me masturbating 

Also they were emotional neglectful too because i guess that's only they knew from their parents

Even though they treat me better now i still kinda afraid of them (especially my mother because she was the most strict one). 
I afraid to tell them my feelings and thoughts or whatever.
I afraid that they will criticize me or look at me with disappointment
I get triggered and anxious many times even if i'm in the same room with them so i close myself in my room all the time

I believe i wasted my twenties because i couldn't get a single degree, i didn't have motivation, i was so bored that felt pointless to continue, i couldn't focus, i had brain fog and i was afraid failure.

Because of my extreme shyness, self-loathing and fear i never had a job
Everyone around me think i'm lazy, i don't know if they right or not but it's difficult to do something if it's really boring, i need something to stimulate my brain, coffee helps even temporary sometimes

I believe i wasted my twenties because i could have done sex, so far i had done it 2 times, while being drunk because of my anxiety, but i wanted more.

Mentally i'm extreme shy and scared but my body needs intimacy and sex by a lot of partners.
I try to satisfy my sexual urges and desires through masturbation and fantasies.
I'm so jealous of other women who have the courage to actively have sex whenever they want with different men.

I believe i wasted my twenties because i didn't take care my appearance that much but i guess i can now because 30 years old is still young i guess
But still i feel like i wasted my youth, so many opportunities and experiences

All of these led me to feel behind in life than people my age (even younger ones) 
Emotionally and mentally i feel behind

I'm sorry for this long post

	•	Loves: walkable neighborhoods, good libraries, coffee and arts scenes, farmers markets, and a “hippie” vibe would be nice haha
	•	A decent airport within 2.5 hours

She’s bigoted, loud, idiotic, deliberately hurts people and has a huge inflated sense of ego. A sociopathic bully with unearned confidence who magically fails upward.

Maybe it’s because she resembles people I know personally, but man, every second she is on screen is torture for me.

I’ve worked in game development and in both startups and global enterprises, and she is the single most unrealistic character in the show.

She starts off a sycophant with a way off the scale derangement that I cannot find the humor in. The way she treats David makes my heart break for him.

The bullying to suicide incident with Pootie shocked me. Too close to real life, that’s immediate grounds for firing and probably being blacklisted from working anywhere.

Her totally illogical move upward after doing nothing of note to Brad’s apprentice also irks me. What exactly has she done or achieved or even delivered for Brad to see something in her?

Her smugness before being used as an inside trader did nothing for her as a character. She hasn’t grown in any meaningful way or changed.

I definitely get the ick from her vibe, I’d never even ask her to brunch - the way she’d been bulling Rachel and Dana (was that forgotten?), let alone have her join Dana’s startup - what exactly would she do there - get coffee? The other three actually have skills to contribute.

1if5maf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1if5maf/my_ideas_for_the_the_next_animal_crossing_game/,My ideas for the the next Animal Crossing Game,"# My Hopes for the Next Animal Crossing Game

I’ve been playing *Animal Crossing* since before I could read via the GameCube version, but I’ll be honest ’m completely biased when it comes to *New Leaf*. It’s hands-down my favorite entry in the series, and most of my hopes and dreams for the next game come from what I loved about it.

# The Village

First off, I want to move away from the deserted island concept. Instead of building a town from scratch, I’d love to arrive in an already established village. As a new resident, you’d still earn the ability to customize the entire villager, but it should come gradually—maybe by working with Isabelle.

For example, she could notice villagers asking for more seating or a park, and after helping out, she teaches you how to place furniture outside. Over time, you’d unlock more permits, eventually even terraforming, but it would be progression-based rather than starting with a blank slate. I want the town to feel *lived-in* from the beginning.

I also think *Re-Tail* should return, but with a fun addition—Reese and Cyrus now have a child! Yes, his fur is purple. He’d help out on weekends, selling unique furniture that he’s still learning to craft. This would be a new set/ theme of furniture that you can work towards collecting all of the pieces for. His designs would have a rough, handmade aesthetic, but after completing his full collection, he could start taking custom orders. Meanwhile, Reese continues selling furniture, and Cyrus sticks to customizations.

The Museum

If the rumors about a *Switch 2* mouse feature are true, this would be the perfect opporuntity to bring back Celeste and constellations!  Designing your own constellations using a precise cursor would be perfect—this could be part of the museum’s second upgrade.

I also think the museum should get a *gift shop* that unlocks over time. It could sell themed items like fish hats, fossil shirts, or butterfly-wing backpacks. A small *café* could also be included, selling coffee to-go at first. Eventually, Brewster could move into his shop in the village, expanding into a full café with a bakery run by a new NPC. Players could buy baked goods like cakes or cupcakes to gift villagers on their birthdays or to boost friendships.

# Nook’s Cranny & The Able Sisters

I don’t have any major changes in mind for these shops, but I’d love to hear what others would want.

# The City

I really want the city to make a comeback. It could start off desolate, with only a few small shops and empty lots, and gradually grow as you progress.

* *Kicks* should start by shining shoes like he used to and selling a small variety of shoes eventually opening a shop where you can customize and buy shoes/socks/ rollerblades.
* A *flower shop* run by a skunk named Fleur could sell bouquets, which players can give to villagers to boost friendships. There could also be a small job system—Fleur might request certain flowers each week, and after completing enough tasks, she’d reward you with ornate flower-themed furniture.
* *Shampoodle* returns, but this time, Harriet also sells hair products. Maybe they add small perks, like a temporary shine effect or new styling options. She could share a building with Labelle, who now sells handmade hair accessories.
* *Gracie* could have another high-end clothing store, and players could work as stylists. Helping villagers pick outfits would earn you bells, and after completing enough requests, Gracie could reward exclusive designer pieces.
* *Tom Nook* runs an apartment building, where random NPCs live. Players could help clean and decorate apartments, eventually unlocking the option to rent one themselves. You’d then have the ability to choose where you spawn when logging in—your village home, apartment, or even a camper which leads to the next idea.

# OK Motors & Campsites

If vehicles are coming, I think campers make the most sense. *OK Motors* could sell and upgrade them, allowing players to drive to a *secluded campsite*. This area would feature “woodsy” villagers, exclusive bugs and fish, and resources like acorns and pinecones that can’t be found elsewhere. Harv is certainly involved, and there are special weather events that occur here too. I think this is where you find Wisp eventually.

# Travel & Multiplayer

* The *airport* should be strictly for visiting friends’ towns.
* *Kapp’n* returns to take players to a tropical island with *New Leaf*\-style mini-games. (If you haven’t played *New Leaf*, check out any video where it shows the mini-games.) No notes—just bring it back)
* The island could also have special villagers, like in the GameCube version, and a cute little bungalow that players can decorate and also ""wake up"" at. I don’t know how waking up in different locations would work logistically, but it’s a game about talking animals—I think we can handle it.

That’s it for now. I love this series so much, and more than anything, I just want more daily activities.

I want comments, questions, concerns, complaints, or—most importantly—your own ideas for the next *Animal Crossing* game? I am so ready for a new game and love hearing new ideas. Thanks :)

A month ago I was fired from my job. I was really upset about the whole situation. I was working as a SW Engineer in a corporation. My job was average-difficult, lots of meetings, lots of distractions. I was generally tired of the job. Sleep problems, lots of coffee, high body weight, lots of sweets, zero workouts and the like. Generally a bad way of life. My life was gloomy, etc.

Now I see that it was good, I have a lot of time and my well-being is at a higher level. I rested. I plan to go back to CrossFit classes. Unfortunately I have to go back to work, I have several offers and I have to decide on one of them. My question is how to take care of my well-being, work-life balance and the like, to avoid burn-out stagnation in a new job. It's hard to do anything else after work. Can you tell me how you take care of yourself during the week? What do you do on the weekend? What does your day look like, what else do you do after work and the like, what tips do you have for me so that I don't go back to stagnation in a new job, etc.

New to the subreddit and IF in general. Started 16:8 and as of today am going for one week. Trying to cut back on everything cold turkey is hard and while I’ve been able to stick to my eating window (12pm to 8pm) I was wondering if there were any tricks to stay motivated? I definitely find myself hungry outside the window and haven’t yet broke it. I’ve been drinking water and coffee (although I put cream and sugar in the coffee so I realize it isn’t a complete cold turkey fast) and switch to tea later in the day but wasn’t sure if there were any other tips to consider. 

Furthermore, I’m someone who socially drinks alcohol and it feels like I can’t do that or make plans if a drink or two once or twice a week is going to break the fast and negatively impact the IF contributions. Is there a way to juggle the commitments of IF while not completely giving up on social events that may have alcohol?

For context I’m 168lbs, 5’10 and 30 year old M. Looking to drop down to 160 and lose a bit of weight around the gut/face area so I realize that any alcohol is counterproductive here but I’m cutting back a lot on how much I used to drink (3/4 times a week 4+ drinks a day).

My wife will decide that something we do together can only be done together and gets angry if I do it myself.

Examples:
- I worked remotely long before COVID and long before she did.  I have always gone on walks throughout the day.  Mostly by myself and sometimes with her.  Recently she decided I should only go for walks with her.  When I told her sometimes I enjoy going for a walk alone to clear my head, she blew up and accused me of having an affair.  (Which I’m not.)

- I have always had coffee in the morning.  Mostly by myself.  Recently she started joining me for coffee, which I thought was nice.  Then one day I couldn’t sleep and woke up an hour earlier (5 vs 6 AM) and made coffee and had a cup while I got my work started.  She blew up and said I was deprioritizing her and forcing us to grow apart.

- She doesn’t say anything but her reaction makes it clear she doesn’t want me to watch TV by myself.  If I suggest a show or a movie she doesn’t like she refuses, but also does not welcome me say going to another room and watching what I want to.  

Two things really puzzle me:
- She takes things I’ve always or mostly done by myself and decides I shouldn’t do them by myself anymore
- If she wants to do any of these things by herself, which she does, it’s ok.

She goes on walks by herself.  She makes and drinks tea by herself.  She watches her own movies and shows by herself.  And I’m OK with all of this.  I’m not OK with the asymmetry.

Strength: While Latte is an experience cop he doesn't showcase much strength feats from what I remember. Wayne on the other hand has surprisingly feats especially when he takes on tougher and larger foes than himself. His best strength feat also has him with his arm pinned down by a large evidence locker and was able to lift it allowing him to remove his arm out under there. He was even handcuffed too when he does that.

Speed: Tie I think they both have the same speed feats being standard speed. It doesn't change much if you allowed them to have thier bikes which made them even.

Durability: the best durability feat Latte has was being injured by a vase on the face. Wayne? He got beaten up, a hot coffee burn his hand, shot by a shotgun and even survived a car crash and falling off from the second floor of a building and fell to a pool. Also helps the fact he has an insane pain tolerance allowing him to numb it.

Skill: Both are rather skillful in thier own departments with Latte knowing detective works and solving cases while Wayne has survival skills and great tactician skills, he was also great in making improvise plans on the fly.

Experience: Obviously Latte, don't get me wrong with Wayne he has dealt so much on his life being with dealing countless crooks or horrible people in his entire life while Latte is an obvious case of being a police chief he probably dealt more criminals than Wayne.

Intelligence: Both have almost on par intelligence with Latte on police work related or manipulations while Wayne is a great tactician as said before. Heck both tend to think plans on the fly.

Powers and Hax: Obviously Latte, Wayne's ""power"" is his pain tolerance obviously it does look impressive but that's it. Latte has an actual ability of regeneration which is Wayne doesn't have.

Weapons: Latte has a gun, Wayne has... well everything he gets his hands on like fireworks, nunchucks, hammer most of the time a nail gun and baseball bat.

Winner: Wayne: Extreme Diff (Latte does have advantages being the fact he is more experienced and his obvious regeneration but said regeneration is not on par with his brother. However Wayne despite being less skilled and is still stronger than Latte and durable along his insane tolerance to pain. Even if Latte got the upperhand Wayne can cheat and fight dirty by literally biting or ripping Latte's skin or Fin off as a distraction and allowing him to get a chance to put him down. But Latte has advantages with his gun which can use to shoot Wayne).",4,1738413538.0,DeathBattleMatchups,3,1.0,False

Another thing is we recently went to a coffee shop and he saw that his exes car was outside so he said he didn’t want to go inside to not see her which i understood so i went in for us. But come to find out today I discovered he is still following that ex on social media. I wouldn’t mind if he hadn’t been the one who had talked badly about her and how she was crazy and did a bunch of bad stuff to him that led him to breakup with her. Another thing similar is that at the beginning of our relationship he told me how he had pictures of him and his exes in his phone because he liked having mementoes of parts of his life. At first I let it slide but then I got bothered by it and even his friends told him that wasn’t right and he eventually deleted them because I asked him to.

He also has a tendency to not text me back for a couple of hours or just leave me on read, his excuse is that he’s busy with schoolwork or he leaves me on read because he wants to respond when he actually has formulated a response instead of just responding right away.

Hi, 

I’m 34M from Britain (East Midlands in England). I’m open to meeting new people to hang out and socialise with, and making new friends. I am a caring, kind, honest, loyal, patient, and sociable person and it would be great to meet other people with the same qualities. It would be great to build close male friendships with other guys, where you can chat/call, and socialise in person. I am particularly keen to meet other guys from Britain, as it would be great to have a friend who is in same country geographically, and where you can chat and meet up in person  regularly where possible and do different social activities together, e.g going to gym/working out, playing sports together, going to socialise at pubs and restaurants etc, going out for coffee etc. 

My interests and hobbies include (but are not limited to): playing sports (badminton, squash, table tennis etc); fitness/gym; watching movies 
(my favourite film genre is horror movies); reading; socialising; going out for coffees; going out for dinner; going to pubs and clubs; learning about new languages and cultures; cooking; playing pool, and bowling; travelling and sightseeing; gaming etc. 

If anyone is interested in chatting and looking for the same thing, or feels they may share some of the same interests or values as me, please feel free to send me a message anytime. It would be great to hear from you, and chat and connect.

Basically for the last few months I've been talking to and hanging out with a coworker (M34). We get lunch or coffee 2-4 times a week and have socialised together outside of work, we went on a hike together, to the cinema and have gone out for dinner both just the two of us and also with some of his friends.

We have talked about our dating lives and dating goals in general ways, like what are we each looking for etc and I think we sort of align on things. Only I'm pretty vocal about being open to meeting someone now whereas he said he feels he needs more time to get over his ex.

Unfortunately I really really have the hots for this guy but I also really enjoy his friendship and I feel like in some ways we sort of fill a relationship void for each other without the romance. I don't know how to handle it or if I should just ignore my feelings, I sometimes feel like it's maybe a bit reciprocal from how he looks and smiles at me, but I also may be imagining it. We are equal in terms of inviting each other for lunch / outside work activities.

 He has told me he's probably looking for someone younger than himself (ouch) as he's not sure if he wants kids yet so maybe that's my sign that it's not to be.


Should I try and ignore my feelings, or sort of wait a while to see if something happens when he feels ready to date? I don't do app dating and I don't socialise a huge amount so I'm just sort of seeing what the world throws my way.

Hi everyone,

I am a male in my 30s, and I am from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, Britain (England). I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

Why? Because when I worked there before, I loved it! It was a small, family owned business and I got along really well with the team. After I left the company, we still met up and went to brunch together. We were close...I really respected the owner and some of his advice helped me and stuck with me through the years...

Fast forward...I was invited back with an offer to fill my former position. I was so happy to see my former coworkers and I was met with warm hugs and silly old jokes. Though things have changed. They've grown, remodeled...but I was there through their rebranding. I did admin, retail sales, marketing, inventory, customer service, coffee orders, business orders, QuickBooks, deposits, coffee grinding, bagging, shipping, website maintenance... everything except the actual roasting itself. I knew the business I just needed a refresh. 

I didn't know there was already tension and conflict brewing before I arrived, and it just got worse. Let me address...The conflict started (I was told) because the son decided to hire his wife during the pandemic as admin relief but she never fully took over the admin responsibilities and has been struggling to keep up. So the Office Administrator has been behind, and there's also a power struggle between them since there's more family members than not in the Management Tier. The Administrator has been there for 15 years while wife just walked in because she's...family.


The owner has taken a step back handing more of the business over to his son and his son hired his wife to be admin. Now the owner was of the mind that my boss was the Office Administrator, but his son and wife believed my boss was the wife. No one was one the same page. My schedule was always different. My priorities were never clear. The wife wouldn't turn over responsibilities to allow my to do my job. 

They only hire only IMMEDIATE family and friends (father, son, wife, daughter, and and all the daughters HS friends who golf and are being recruited by Ivy League for their 'champion golfing skills', allow the teen boy & girl workers to hangout in the bathroom alone together (I caught them chilling), leave boxes of product & files all over the hallways & offices creating a tripping hazard, allowed non- employees to drive the company vehicle and they crashed it, and the wife is so entitled and lazy she won't answer the phone, finish her work on time, or even walk 10 feet into the warehouse to get a trashcan for her office. The bathroom trashcans (which are also for public use) were overflowing with paper towels and tampons. 

They installed a phone at the counter so baristas have to answer calls. Baristas also do QuickBooks because of the invoicing backlog. She will literally write an order on scratch paper and 'save it' for a month before it was entered in the system and billed. She's actually slowed down production, backlogged invoicing, and delayed deliveries. It's a mess over there.

Well...we didn't get along...or something...and a day after the owner said they wanted me there full-time with salary because I have a lot to contribute, the son called me the next day and fired me. I was struggling prior to coming on, but it's more of a struggle...and long term employees are quitting.

I know you think I'm being petty, but I'm tired of businesses that take advantage, walk on people, and treat them like trash. 

Don't support them.

(https://www.cscecompetitions.ca/en/home/ ) As someone who grew up in Winnipeg, I'm glad to see U of M being willing to showcase itself and take opportunities. U of M has great things going for it already. Part of why U of M is hosting is because our team won Bronze last year. However, there are obvious logistics and urban planning issues.

1. U of M doesn't have enough campus residences. In past competitions, teams usually lived on campus since the competition happens in summer, meaning lots of available beds, but U of M doesn't have enough beds even during the summer. For example, UWestern has 6200 beds, UBC has 14,000 [https://vancouver.housing.ubc.ca/](https://vancouver.housing.ubc.ca/) but UManitoba only has 1300 beds [https://umanitoba.ca/housing](https://umanitoba.ca/housing), which is the least amount of any Canadian university. Even the universities people make fun of such as U of Regina and Lakehead U in Thunder Bay have more. Many participants will have to live in hotels far away, wasting time and money. 

2. U of M does not have many amenities surrounding it. First of all, it's located in a suburb. U of M is furthest away from its own city's downtown compared to other universities. But suburbs can have good design. One key quality of life metric for university students is the amount of ""third places"" (search that up if you haven't heard), as in social spaces like coffee shops, public benches, etc.

Other universities, even those in small towns and suburbs, often have mixed-use apartments next to campus with cool restaurants. The apartments close to U of M have 0 stores on the ground floor (other than the Arc), and 0 public benches. Such things should be the bare minimum of any neighbourhood close to a university. In addition, many buildings on/near campus in other universities have student-run coffee shops with 50-cent coffee, free board game lounges, etc. 

3. Bad roads, bad traffic signal design, sidewalks, cycling and public transit infrastructure. Civil engineers especially notice that stuff. Just imagine a UBC student being used to Skytrain and no pothole roads having to travel down Pembina Highway which is almost the textbook definition of bad design. 

4. Stereotypes about dangerous stabbings are exaggerated. However, the recent AVM situation indicates bad security. I don't think we have to be like U of T which locks every door after 8 PM, but there should be some measures. 

TLDR: the U of M campus and areas around campus might be a disappointment for people from other universities and cause negative stereotypes about Winnipeg to become worse

On the bright side, if some participants leave campus area and explore the rest of Winnipeg, that might change their stereotypes. I really hope that some would be willing to explore The Forks, Winnipeg Art Gallery, try a museum or two, try some Filipino and Indigenous restaurants (really rare in other cities), and truly appreciate Winnipeg. ",0,1738412170.0,umanitoba,1,0.38,False

- Not particular with age. Kahit 60 ka na basta di ka magpapalpitate sa kape, ok lang. ✌️
- Wala din ako pake sa itsura, body type or kahit ano about you physically. 
- Good speaker and listener.
- Kung mas matangkad ka sa akin or same height tayo, pakiusap ko lang na wag ka na magheels. Maawa ka sa akin please. 🤣
- Working professional din sana. 

About me:

- 33 / M / Cubao, QC
- 5'3"" (1 inch short para sa normal height ng lalake. 😆)
- Working professional 
- A fun-loving guy.
- Loves music and can sing din (if that matters)
